      "content": "Chapter 1- Shooting Stars\nKnock, knock, knock.\nSomeone knocked on a wooden door.\nNo answer came.\nCreak.\nThe door opened slowly, and an immaculately dressed person stepped in. It was a man with white hair, but it was a bit difficult to discern his age. Even though he had white hair, which obviously came from old age, there were no wrinkles on his face. If one only looked at his face, one might believe that he was rather young.\nHowever, appearances often deceived.\nIf someone heard of this person's age, they wouldn't be able to believe whoever told them.\nThe man looked around the room with professional eyes.\nIt was a small study filled with all kinds of books, scriptures, tomes, and papers. An unbelievably soft, violet carpet was strewn across the ground, and a cozy fire crackled in the fireplace.\nThe man's eyes looked at the back of the room.\nAnother man was sitting on a chair behind a mahogany desk. Several papers were strewn across the desk, and the man practically lay in his chair, his head looking upward.\nThe man at the door slightly shook his head and walked over.\nBang!\nHe slightly kicked the table.\n\"Oh, wha- huh? Oh, good morning, Wester,\" the man who had just been sleeping said after recovering from the shock. He was an old man with gentle facial features, and everyone that saw him would believe him to be a nice grandpa.\n\"It's evening, sir,\" Wester, the butler, said to the old man.\n\"Oh, already?\" the old man asked in confusion as he looked around his room. \"I was working on this year's reward for the Clan Tournament. Guess I lost track of time,\" he said.\n\"Mhm,\" Wester uttered, deciding not to comment on how he had found his master napping.\n\"What? You don't believe me?\" the old man asked with an offended expression. \"Look! It's over there,\" he said.\nA tome started to float from the desk and stopped in front of Wester.\nWester took the tome, opened it, and scanned through it.\n\"An Element-Neutral King Rank Spell,\" Wester commented. \"You didn't read the dossiers about the candidates, did you?\" Wester asked.\nThe old man felt like he had been found out.\nBANG!\nWester put his hands on the stacked dossiers on the table, making it impossible for the old man to peek at them.\nThe old man groaned. \"Fine! Fine!\" he groaned, \"but it doesn't really matter, does it? Element-Neutral Spells are worth more than Element-Specific Spells anyway.\"\n\"Sir, if you keep creating Element-Neutral Spells for every tournament, the other Clans will start believing that we don't care about the tournament,\" Wester commented.\nThe old man groaned again. \"Fine! I'll just create one for every Element, and you can choose whichever you want to hand out in the future tournaments.\"\nWester put the Element-Neutral King Rank Spell under his arm but didn't comment on the old man's words.\nSilence.\nThe old man felt a bit awkward as his butler only stood before him, not saying anything.\n\"Do you need something else?\" the old man asked.\nSilence.\n\"The Child of Calamity has vanished,\" Wester said.\nThe old man was a bit taken aback as he looked at Wester with skepticism. \"Vanished? Did he flee? Why would he? He had money, freedom, status, a family, everything. What happened?\"\n\"We don't know,\" Wester said. \"When our people arrived at his home for their monthly visit, he was simply gone.\"\n\"Did you search for him?\" the old man asked.\n\"Of course, sir,\" Wester answered. \"I sent the seventh legion to search through every particle of the surrounding 50,000 kilometers. As a mere Apprentice, he couldn't possibly have traveled further, and we would have noticed any spatial fluctuations. However, we still couldn't find him.\"\nThe old man scratched his chin in thought. \"Not even the other Clans could have hidden something like that. Additionally, they would only be shooting a fireball in their own faces by taking him away. I'm certain that he hadn't had any help.\"\n\"That only means that his Affinity has claimed his own life. That would also explain why you can't find a trace of him,\" the old man muttered.\nWester nodded. \"That is also our assumption.\"\nThe old man also nodded. \"I presume you need the seal?\" he asked.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nThe old man gestured with his hand for Wester to give him something, and a piece of paper appeared in the air, which then floated to the desk.\nThe old man looked at the paper and read it.\nThen, he put his finger at the bottom of the piece of paper, and his finger shone with purple lightning for an instant.\n\"As always,\" the old man commented as the paper flew back to Wester.\n\"As always,\" Wester said.\nWester turned around, left the study, and wished the old man a good evening.\nAfter Wester left, the old man looked with furrowed brows at the middle of the room.\nThe old man waved his fingers. Some water gathered in the air, and a clear pool formed.\nThe old man looked into the pool, and the pool reflected a seemingly infinite world.\nThe old man's eyes moved with rapid speeds as he scanned through every hidden corner of the world in the pool.\nTen seconds later, the pool vanished, and the old man laid back on the chair.\n\"Sure enough, he's gone. No trace of him. That's a new one,\" the old man mumbled to himself. \"I mean, Affinities can eat up their owners, so it's not really unbelievable. It just hasn't happened with the Child of Calamity before in the past 100,000 years. This smells fishy! Something's different this time!\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The old man scratched his chin for a while longer, but then he put his head back in a sleeping position.\n\"Well, doesn't matter. The legions will find the new Child of Calamity anyway,\" he commented to himself as he closed his eyes.\nMeanwhile, Wester was walking through a dimly lit hallway made of stone. Every step he took seemingly pulled him forward for hundreds of meters. It was difficult to discern what was more surprising, the fact that Wester was moving this quickly or the fact that the hallway was so long.\nAfter some seconds, Wester arrived in front of a wooden door, which he quickly opened and walked out of.\nWester arrived in a grand hall.\nThe hall was two kilometers long and 300 meters high. Powerful weapons and adornments were on the walls as imposing, violet flags hung down from every column. The flags had white lightning bolts imprinted on them, and a gigantic table was in the middle of the hall with some chairs surrounding it.\nRight now, the hall was empty.\nWester went through another door and down another hallway, this hallway being far bigger and grander than the previous one.\nWester walked through another door.\nThis room had several tables and chairs. Many different kinds of magical equipment could be found in the room. Several papers and different objects were on the desks.\n\"Good evening, sir. Do you require something?\"\nA blonde woman with ostentatious purple robes stood up politely. Electricity sparked around her as space seemed to bend around her.\nShe exuded incredible power.\n\"Oh, Sarah, perfect, I was searching for you. Everything going well?\" Wester asked politely.\n\"Yes, sir. Thank you for asking, sir,\" the woman spoke politely.\n\"Sarah, I need you to do something for me,\" Wester said politely as he took out the paper the old man had signed earlier.\nThe paper floated over, and the woman looked at the paper.\nHer eyes widened more and more as she continued reading. \"Yes, sir,\" she said.\nThen, she took the paper and walked over to a wall. She spoke complex and unfamiliar words that warped her surroundings.\nTen seconds later, an outcropping in the shape of a piece of paper appeared on the wall.\nSarah put the paper in the outcropping, and the paper burned away.\nDING! DING! DING!\nThree bells rang throughout an unfathomable distance, their sounds ignoring the upper limit of the speed of sound.\n\"Have a good hunt,\" Wester commented politely as he left the room.\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Sarah said with a bow.\nSHING!\nSarah was engulfed by a bright light, but the bright light vanished just as quickly as it had arrived.\nHowever, Sarah had undergone a world-shaking transformation.\nHer purple robes were replaced by a shining silver armor, covered with different runes. Golden wing bones were on the back of her armor, which were quickly filled out by bolts of lightning, resembling the feathers.\nA two-meter-long spear appeared in her hands, also crackling with lightning.\nSHING!\nThen, Sarah seemingly vanished.\nShe had teleported away!\nSHING!\nSarah reappeared in the grand hall through which Wester had gone.\nHowever, the hall was no longer empty.\n10,000 people in golden armor with golden staves filled the hall in an orderly manner.\n\"We greet the general!\" the ten people at the front of the army spoke in unison.\nSarah exuded irresistible power as she looked at the gathered army.\nThis was the sixth legion, which was responsible for reconnaissance.\n\"Men and women of the sixth legion,\" Sarah said, her voice echoing throughout the grand hall. \"The Ancestor has given an order!\"\nSilence.\n\"The Child of Calamity has vanished, and a new Child of Calamity must have appeared in the world. The sixth legion will comb the world. Every child in the world below the age of one must have their Affinity tested with a blood test! If any child tests positive for an unknown affinity, the child will be brought to me personally!\"\n\"I expect you all to finish by the morning!\"\n\"Yes, General!\" all the soldiers echoed.\n\"Go!\"\nSHING! SHING! SHING!\nAll 10,000 people teleported out of the hall and reappeared in the air outside the building.\nBelow them was a magnificent purple castle, built on top of several mountains of unfathomable height.\nThe castle itself was several kilometers wide!\nLightning crackled violently on the storm clouds below the mountains where the castle was built on.\nNothing aside from an endless sea of clouds filled with lightning could be seen.\nThe 10,000 people in the air crackled with lightning as their bodies shone in golden light.\nBANG!\nThen, with an explosion, all soldiers transformed into lightning as they shot into the horizon.\nTheir speed was impossible to follow with one's eyes.\nOn this night, many humans would notice golden shooting stars in the sky.\nOn this night, all babies below the age of one would gain a tiny red dot on the fingertip of their index finger.\nThis was where the blood was drawn from for the test.\nNo one but the peak powers would notice that this had even happened.\nThe entire world had been combed in but a single night and no one had noticed.\nYet, the Child of Calamity had not been found.",

      "content": "Chapter 2 - Alex\nOne month earlier, on Earth.\n\"Thank you for your loyal support, and please visit us again!\"\nA superficially cheerful voice shouted this phrase from a medium-sized grocery store. The phrase was targeted at a middle-aged man that was just leaving the store. The middle-aged man slightly waved one of his hands to show that he had heard, but he couldn't be bothered to answer.\nAs soon as the man left, the grocery store cashier sighed and went back to the cash register. The cashier was a young man with blonde hair, and he looked like he had just hit his 20s. A slight muscular frame was still visible when one looked at him from the back, but when looking at him from the front, one could only see a rather sizable beer belly.\nClack, thump, clack, thump!\nAs the cashier walked back to the cash register, the sound of his cane could be heard on the floor of the grocery store.\n\"Hello, welcome to Stevie's!\" the cashier greeted with superficial politeness as he handled the next customer.\n\"Hard day at work, huh?\" the young customer asked the cashier.\n\"It's alright,\" the cashier answered with a slight chuckle. \"Everyone has to make a living.\"\nHowever, these words didn't reflect the cashier's real feelings.\n'This fucking grocery store is killing me, I swear!' he thought as he \"happily\" bagged the groceries. 'Every day with the same shit. Alex, do this! Alex, do that! I swear, when I've saved up enough money for college, I'm going to burn this place to the ground!'\nOf course, these were only thoughts created in a stressful situation. Alex knew that he wouldn't really do it.\nThis cashier was Alexander Hoffmann.\nAlex for short.\nAlex's life hadn't always been like this.\nHe had had a bright future ahead of him in the past.\nSadly, life didn't go his way.\nOn the urging of his father, Alex started doing sports when he was 12. After all, doing sports while growing was very beneficial to the development of a teenager.\nAlex's father was a huge fan of the MNFA, the Multinational Fighting Association.\nThe MNFA let fighters from nearly all disciplines of martial arts fight each other with the least rules possible. So, in short, it was an organization that handled mixed martial arts fights, MMA for short.\nAlex had also grown to like watching these fights, and when his father urged him to do some sports, Alex decided that he wanted to do MMA.\nHis parents' feelings were mixed on that subject.\nOn one hand, it was great that their child was finally doing some sports, but MMA could get pretty dangerous if something wasn't handled correctly.\nHowever, since it was not professional MMA and since there were several coaches around in the local gym, they agreed.\nSome time later, when Alex had had his first practice fight against another kid in the gym, he got his ass handed to him. Yet, this experience awakened a certain kind of stubbornness in him, an urge to win.\nSadly, he lost the next couple of practice matches too. Well, one couldn't really consider these matches a loss since they weren't real matches. They were simply some sparring between two students.\nYet, when Alex didn't clearly win a fight, he saw it as a loss.\nAlex had already planned to change sports and join another one since it felt frustrating to see how everyone was better than himself. Yet, he wanted to win at least one time!\nSo, he continued training, and eventually, he won.\nWhen Alex won, he felt something that he had never felt before.\nIt was a kind of indescribable high!\nHe felt like he was floating on clouds, and he felt like he was the greatest in the world!\nThe feeling of fighting, which had always annoyed him since his body hurt after it, transformed into the polar opposite.\nThis feeling of fighting others wasn't annoying.\nIt was simply a clash between men!\nThey were showcasing their power in a very primal fashion!\nAlex wanted to feel this feeling again!\nAlex stayed in the gym and even came more often. MMA had transformed from a chore into a hobby. The pain of sore muscles became a familiar pain that Alex even started to enjoy. It sounded cheesy, but the common phrase of every single sports coach in the world resonated with Alex.\n\"Pain is simply weakness leaving your body!\"\nAs the years passed, Alex completely focused on MMA. Even his grades started to drop, which had already been average to begin with. Alex wasn't stupid, but he never paid attention in school and didn't learn anything.\nStuff like math and physics was still okay since he could often deduce the correct answers logically, which was why those grades didn't suffer much. However, subjects like history and foreign languages had it far worse since one had to actually learn for these things.\nAlex had a ton of arguments with his parents over this, but Alex always said that his future was MMA. He would join the MNFA, and he would earn a ton of money!\nAlex barely passed high school but decided against going to college.\nMMA was his future!\nAlex trained as hard as he could!\nHis entire life depended on his success!\nIf he didn't manage to get into the MNFA, he would lose!\nAnd one day, just after Alex's 20th birthday, he got accepted!\nThis was the greatest day of his life!\nHis dream was about to become a reality!\nAlex won his first match pretty easily since his first opponent was pretty weak. His horrible win-loss record proved that.\nAlex also won his second match, but it was a close one.\nYet, tragedy struck at Alex's third match.\nThe fight had been going fine. There was some back and forth, and he and his opponent were pretty evenly matched.\nAnd then, the accident happened.\nAlex and his opponent had been fighting from a distance since no one managed to find a good opening to tackle the other one to the ground. Alex saw an opening in his opponent's defense and performed a roundhouse kick.\nCRACK!\nHis opponent barely recovered before the kick struck, and he managed to block it haphazardly.\nHis opponent's elbow hit Alex's ankle.\nAlex's ankle immediately broke, and the medics jumped into the ring.\nA day later, Alex got the news that his bones had damaged the nerves and muscles in his leg.\nThey could only fix it to the point that would allow him to walk somewhat normally with the support of a cane, but that was it. There was nothing more they could do.\nAlex's career was over.\nFrom the highest high of his life, Alex fell to the lowest low.\nAlex had earned quite a sum of money from his three fights, but he basically wasted all of it in a drunken haze of destruction over the next year.\nHis life was over.\nThere was nothing anymore.\nAfter a year, his family held an intervention for him, and Alex finally realized that he had to stop being such a pussy. One year was more than enough to wallow in self-pity!\nSo, Alex planned to save up some money for college.\nRight now, Alex was 22 years old, and he was working in a grocery store precisely for this reason.\nEven though his past was filled with incredible highs, and even though he fell into the lowest low, Alex was still young, and he knew that he could still make something of his life. He only had to work his ass off for the foreseeable future.\nThen, he would go to college, and everything would turn for the better!\nTime passed in the grocery store, and after helping close up the place, Alex left at around 10 pm. It was already dark out, but the streets were well lit. After all, Alex lived and worked in a less savory part of a big city.\nAs Alex stepped out of the grocery store, his nose wrinkled. No matter how long he had lived here, he simply couldn't get used to the disgusting stench of the dirty streets.\nThis part of the city was for low-income families, and the state of the streets reflected that very well.\nGarbage, cigarette butts, old newspapers, old furniture.\nThis was a common sight on these streets.\nAlex tried to ignore the stench and walked home. His home was barely a kilometer away, a distance where people argued if they should drive or walk.\nAlex was walking since he wanted to keep his living costs as low as possible. Additionally, Alex somewhat enjoyed the walk since he was used to doing a lot of physical exercise.\nAfter some minutes, Alex stopped as he looked at a couple of cigarette butts on the street.\nAnd the cigarette bin right beside them.\n'Oh, come on!' he thought. 'The bin is right there!'\nAlex used his cane to push the cigarette butts to the side of the closest building. He hated these people that treated the streets as their own toilet, but he didn't hate them enough to pick up the cigarette butts to throw them away.\nAfter some minutes, Alex heard the sound of a whining dog, and he stopped.\nThis wasn't the usual sound of a whining dog.\nThe dog's whining was very loud, high-pitched, painful, and desperate. Obviously, the dog was in a ton of pain.\nThe sound of dogs was normal in this city, but that sound definitely wasn't normal.\nAlex searched around for the dog and found it in a dark alleyway between two buildings.\nThe dog could barely be seen at the edge of the streetlamps' lights.\nBlood.\nBone.\nA concerned look appeared on Alex's face as he saw the dog. Both of its hindlegs were severely broken. He could see blood coming out of its legs, and he could even see its bones poking out.\nNo wonder it was in so much pain.\nAlex thought about if he should help it or not. He didn't have a pet, but he also didn't hate animals. It was nice to look at and interact with them, but he didn't want to bear the responsibility of owning a pet of his own.\nOn top of that, pets were expensive.\nYet, when Alex saw the broken legs, he got reminded of his own injury. A slight pain came from his ankle as the scene of being rushed into the hospital returned to Alex's mind.\nIn the end, Alex sighed.\n'Fine, I'll bring you to a vet, but I won't pay much for your care.'\nAlex slowly walked into the alleyway and closed in on the dog. The dog didn't move and only continued crying in pain as Alex came closer.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Don't move!\"\nAlex stopped as the familiar feeling of adrenaline rushing through his veins assaulted him.\nThere was a knife at his throat!\nAlex didn't dare to move as panic took hold of him, but he calmed down somewhat when he felt a hand hurriedly searching through his pockets.\n'A robbery,' Alex thought.\nAlex had only been in panic for two seconds, but his old fighting instincts kicked in.\nYet, Alex didn't attack.\nIt was essential to analyze the opponent first. Otherwise, mistakes were bound to happen.\nAs the hand of the robber searched through Alex's pocket, Alex slightly glanced at the robber. He wore a black hoody and black sweatpants. It was hard to make out his facial features in the darkness while looking at him from such an awkward angle.\nAlex glanced at the arm that held the knife.\n'He's gripping the knife with so much force that his arm is shaking, and the knife is also not directly touching my neck. He's probably new at this. Additionally, his arm is basically touching my shoulder.'\nAlex also noted the appearance and condition of the dog.\n'They injured the dog to lure me into this alleyway. A clever but cruel trick.'\nHowever, a slight smirk appeared on Alex's face.\n'Sadly, you chose the wrong target!'\nBANG!\nAlex's head shot backward and hit the lowered head of the robber. At the same time, Alex violently shoved his shoulder upward, pushing the knife away from him.\nThe robber became disoriented. It was never a good feeling to butt heads with another person.\nAlex was in just as much pain, but as a former fighter, he could still make rational decisions under pain.\nWithout hesitation, Alex lifted his cane.\nBANG!\nAnd hit the side of the robber's head with full force.\nThe robber immediately lost his consciousness under the attack. Alex hadn't fought in over a year, but his muscles were still more powerful than average.\nThe robber fell over as Alex smirked.\nCRACK!\nAlex's smirk froze as it slowly transformed into terror.\n'No! I didn't want to do that!'\nSince the robber had lost consciousness, his body simply fell over to the side.\nAnd his head violently hit the hard pavement.\nA pool of dark blood was quickly forming below the robber's cracked skull.\nAlex's world stopped.\nHe couldn't comprehend what was happening.\nDid… did he just kill someone?\nAlex began hyperventilating in panic as his mind tried to comprehend the magnitude of what he had just done.\nCRACK!\nAnd then, Alex's mind vanished.\nAlex's body landed beside the robbers.\nA huge crack could be seen at the back of his head.\nBehind Alex's body stood another man dressed in black, fury on his face. In his hand, he carried a blood-smeared crowbar.\nThis was the robber's friend, who had been hiding behind some trash in case something went wrong.\nWhen he saw the corpse of his friend, fury took hold of him, and he hit Alex on the back of the head with his crowbar, full force.\nAlex died instantly.\nHe didn't even know how he had died.\n\"Fuck! FUCK!\" the second robber shouted as he didn't know what he should do now.\nHe had two corpses on his hands now!\nWhile the robber was panicking, two invisible, azure wisps left the corpses.\nThe azure wisps traveled into the sky and seemingly left the realm of earth.\nAlex didn't feel alive nor dead.\nHe was awake but also not awake.\nOne could liken the state of his mind to dreaming. His mind didn't work properly, but there were still some rudimentary thoughts that appeared.\nThe azure wisps entered an empty void, and they stopped.\nMany other wisps were there already, and new ones joined every second.\nAfter a minute, a bright, white light suddenly appeared in the nothingness, and all the wisps flew to it.\nThey were inherently drawn to it.\nThis was where they were supposed to go.\nThese were the souls of the dead, and Alex was just one insignificant soul among many.\nSuddenly, the void shook!\nIt was like reality was being torn apart!\nHowever, the wisps only continued to travel to the light. They didn't even notice what was happening.\nReality seemingly broke like glass as an even darker hole appeared.\nThen, a gigantic hand shot out of the hole.\nIt was the hand of a young, adult man.\nWith unreal speeds, the hand shot at one particular wisp, Alex's soul.\nThe hand used its thumb and index finger to clamp down on Alex's soul, and Alex felt clarity return to his mind.\n'Wait, what happened?'\nYet, before Alex could look at his surroundings, he felt himself being pulled into the distance.\nBefore the hand vanished into the closing rift of reality, Alex could hear a voice, and that voice only spoke one word:\n\"Yoink!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 3 - Dream?\n\"What? What happened? Where am I!?\"\nAlex's mind was confused beyond belief. He knew that something had happened to him. He felt like he had been dreaming, and just now woke up.\nHowever, he had no idea where he was.\nAlex only knew that he was currently standing in the most imposing hall he had ever seen in his entire life. Just the sheer size of this place struck him dumb. Alex suspected that this hall was over a kilometer wide! It was probably even a hundred meters tall!\nWho would build such a thing!?\nThe entire place was colored in black and red, evoking a kind of evil feeling.\n'Did they hire some teenager to design this place? Who colors such a grand hall in black and red?' Alex thought as his brows furrowed. 'Even more, why is everything empty? Sure, there are some things at the walls, but there is nothing in between them except for this big, dark carpet.'\nAlex looked at the carpet and noticed that something was embroidered on it.\nIt was a white jester's mask. Basically, it was a white mask with the face of a laughing person.\n'Creepy.'\nAlex looked to the front, and his eyes widened.\nAbout a hundred meters to Alex's front was a vast and tall throne. The throne was probably over ten meters wide and reached the ceiling of this gigantic hall.\nAlex also noticed that someone was sitting on the throne.\nIt was a young man, probably in his early twenties, just like Alex. He had long black and red hair, but Alex couldn't see how long his hair was exactly since this man was currently facing Alex, looking at him with a smirk.\nAnother interesting aspect of the man's appearance was his red eyes, but Alex didn't notice them from such a distance.\nAlthough, he also looked a bit ridiculous since he was far too small for such a wide throne.\n'Is that a goth kid?' Alex thought. 'Wait, as far as I know, goths are more black and grey. I think emos are more black and red. Did he design this place? Probably, judging by his get-up.'\nAlex continued staring at the young man while the young man only smirked back.\nSeconds passed.\nAlex was looking awkwardly from side to side. The other party wasn't initiating a conversation and only stared at him.\nShould he initiate a conversation?\nWell, he had enough questions, so why not?\n\"Excuse me!\" Alex shouted loudly, his voice echoing in the vast, empty hall. After all, the man was around 100 meters away from him.\nNo reaction.\n'Maybe he didn't hear me?' Alex thought, unsure.\nAlex took a step forward.\nThump!\nAlex fell forward and barely caught himself with his hands.\n'What? Where's my cane?!' Alex thought in panic as he searched around for his cane. Sadly, he couldn't find it.\n'I mean, I can kind of walk without a cane, but it's awkward as fuck,' Alex thought as he stood up.\nHis balance was rather stable, which surprised him. Usually, due to the nerve damage in his ankle, his right foot always awkwardly flopped around. Alex could only stand on that foot by perfectly balancing his bodyweight along his entire leg.\nAlex took one step forward, and he took a deep breath in shock as he realized that he could use his right foot!\nHow?!\nAlex balanced on his left leg as he moved his right foot in the air.\nFull mobility!\nNo awkwardness!\nWhoooosh!\nAlex performed a roundhouse kick, and his mind was going wild.\nThis was just like back when he had been fighting!\n'What the hell?!'\nAlex tried out his right leg some more as he jumped and kicked a couple of times.\nHowever, after some seconds, Alex deflated with a sigh. 'There's no way my foot is actually healed. Even if it had been healed, there should be some minor awkwardness in my movement, and some of the muscles in my foot should have atrophied.'\n'This is obviously a dream.'\nBOOOOM!\nThe sound of an explosion rang throughout the hall, coming from Alex's front! The sound was so loud that Alex's ears started ringing as he was thrown back by a shockwave.\nLuckily, the shockwave didn't injure him.\n\"Every damn time!\" an angry voice shouted.\nAlex shook his head to regain his calm.\n\"Every damn time!\" the voice repeated, obviously working itself into a rage. \"Every time I get a soul from your world, they always think that it's a dream!\"\nAlex lifted his head and looked towards the throne.\nWas the young man speaking?\nIt was hard to see from such a distance.\n'Wait, then how can I hear him? It sounds like he's just beside me.'\n\"This is getting boring!\" the voice said with annoyance. \"How about, one time, one of you guys just walks forward? How about, one time, one of you guys just walks up to me?\"\nAlex looked around as he tried to find the origin of the voice, but there was nothing around him. On top of that, the voice was coming from the front.\nWas it really that young man?\n\"Every damn time, I watch you guys, and every damn time, you do the same fucking thing!\" the man shouted.\nAlex saw that the man's body was slightly moving from side to side, but it was hard to judge from such a distance.\n\"Oh, what's this hall? Oh, what happened to my body?\" the man shouted with a sarcastic tone.\n'I think he lifted his right arm to imitate someone speaking,' Alex thought as he concentrated on the throne in the distance.\nBANG!\nAnother explosion, but this time, Alex managed to barely remain upright.\nHowever, this explosion was even more shocking than the first one.\nWhy?\nBecause Alex had seen what had caused the explosion.\nThe young man had lifted his right arm and then slammed down.\nAnd then, something shocking happened.\nThe armrest of the throne moved inward and stopped below the young man's fist!\nA ten-meter-wide throne had shrunken to just a bit more than five meters!\nAnd the explosion?\nThat was the young man's fist!\nJust the mere act of slamming one's fist down on an armrest had thrown Alex to the ground from a distance of over a hundred meters.\nThat was insane!\nAll of this took some time to describe, but barely any time had passed in reality. The young man was still ranting.\n\"And then. And then! And then you always say the same fucking words! You always say 'excuse me'! Can't you say something else for a change?! Can't at least one of you guys say 'hello' or 'good morning' or 'fuck you' or just ANYTHING else?!\"\nAlex still couldn't deal with the situation.\n'Okay, that's impossible. This must be a dream!' he thought.\nWhoooop!\nSuddenly, the distance between Alex and the man shrank. In less than a second, Alex stood barely half a meter in front of the man.\n\"What did you just fucking think?!\" the young man growled with narrowed eyes. \"I dare you! Think that one more time! See what happens!\"\nFor some reason, Alex felt terrified right now.\nUsually, he wouldn't be afraid of a young man sitting on a throne, but for some reason, Alex felt like he had to be very careful right now. Otherwise, he might make a mistake he would regret!\nAlex looked nervously into the eyes of the young man while the young man glared back.\n\"Then, how about I say it instead?\" Alex asked.\nThe young man blinked a couple of times in surprise.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Oh, that's a new one,\" he said, all his rage gone. \"Do go on ahead. I want to see how this plays out.\"\nAlex gulped.\n\"This is obviously a dream,\" Alex said.\n\"What makes you think so?\" the young man asked as he leaned back. The distant back of the throne moved forward of its own volition.\n\"That,\" Alex said as he pointed at the back of the throne. \"Thrones don't do that.\"\n\"Mine does,\" the man said with a smirk.\n\"How?\" Alex asked. He wanted to know how the guy could rationalize something like that.\n\"Like this.\"\nWhoop! Whoop! Whoop!\nSuddenly, the entire hall became wavy. Walls were shooting at Alex and then going far into the distance. The throne was even waving around like one of these wacky inflatable arm tube men on the streets.\nSurprisingly, Alex stayed calm.\n\"See?\" Alex said calmly. \"Obviously a dream.\"\nThe hall stopped, and the young man wrinkled his nose.\n\"Alright, this is getting boring.\"\nSHING!\nAnd Alex's right foot was cut off at his ankle, just like that.\nThe young man didn't even move.\nAlex fell to the ground in surprise and looked at his bleeding stump of a foot. His face turned into horror, but after two seconds, it surprisingly went back to a calm expression.\n\"See? I don't feel any pain,\" Alex said. \"Therefore, this is a dream.\"\nThe young man chuckled.\n\"You're under shock. Give it some seconds,\" the young man said with a smirk.\nAlex only looked with skepticism at the young man and then back at his right foot. He moved his right leg around a bit in morbid curiosity.\nSome seconds passed.\nAlex's face turned into a slight grimace. \"Okay, maybe it stings a little.\"\n\"Give it time,\" the young man said.\nAlex started sweating as his breathing quickened.\n\"Okay, maybe it stings a lot.\"\n\"Give it time,\" the young man repeated with a smirk.\n\"Maybe… maybe… argh!\"\nAlex's voice stopped as his hand went to his right leg. His entire body was straining itself as it became harder for him to breathe.\nAnd then, Alex lost it.\nHowever, he couldn't be blamed for his poor reaction. Take a normal person from a street and cut their leg off. See how they react.\n\"There we go,\" the young man said with a smirk. \"Now, do you-\"\n\"Aaaargh!\"\nThe young man's brows furrowed. \"Okay, now do-\"\n\"Aaaargh!\"\n\"Shut up!\"\nWhooop!\nSuddenly, all the pain disappeared.\nAlex's mind was shocked.\nWait, what?\nAlex looked down and saw that his right foot was back.\n'What?'\n\"You done?!\" the young man asked with an annoyed tone. \"You got that outta your system, yes, or do you want to shout some more?\"\nAlex couldn't comprehend the situation as he tried to make sense of everything.\n\"Alright, this is taking too long!\" the young man said as he stood up.\nBANG!\nAnd then he kicked Alex into the side, throwing him two meters into the distance.\n\"Alright, so,\" the man began as he continued walking to Alex. \"You died. You are dead. This is not a dream.\"\nBANG!\nAnother kick.\nAlex coughed several times. These kicks were no joke!\nThe man continued walking to Alex. \"You were just on your way to the afterlife, and that's when I grabbed your soul.\"\nAlex started to get up, but before he could straighten himself, he got hit by another kick that threw him into the distance.\n\"I've transported you to my Realm,\" the young man said with a smirk as his hands gestured to the hall around him. \"This is my personal palace.\"\nAlex quickly got up as the young man reached him again.\nWhoosh!\nThe young man's kick missed as Alex turned his upper body sideways.\nBANG!\nAnd then, Alex punched the young man in the face!",

      "content": "Chapter 4 - Death\nTime seemingly froze as Alex's fist hit the young man's nose.\n\"Argh, fuck!\" Alex suddenly shouted as he shook his fist. He looked at it and saw that his index and middle finger were broken.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex had just punched the nose of the young man, but it felt like he had punched a nail made of steel!\nThe young man only smirked viciously. \"And that's exactly why I chose you!\" he said. By now, his voice sounded calm but arrogant.\nAlex looked with shock at the young man.\nWhat the hell was going on?!\n\"Any normal person,\" the young man said as he gestured grandly to his hall, \"who saw what you have seen would cower before me in fear. Everything I have shown up to now, my power over space, my ability to cut off your leg in an instant, even this very hall would have sent awe, fear, terror, and respect into anyone's heart.\"\n\"However!\" the man shouted, his voice sounding pleased. \"You are not like a normal person. No, you are different.\"\nThe man took a step forward as Alex began sweating. His fight or flight instincts kicked in. Usually, he always chose fight, but in this instant, he felt like flight was a better alternative.\n\"Everyone else would have thrown themselves at my knees, begging me to not play with their lives any longer.\"\nAnother step.\n\"That's so boring,\" the man said with a neutral expression. \"I want excitement, fighting, someone that doesn't take shit from anyone.\"\n\"I want chaos!\" the man said with a smirk as he looked deeply into Alex's eyes.\nAlex gulped.\n\"Chosen for what?\" Alex asked, trying to hide the panic in his voice.\n\"Chosen to change the world!\" the man said with a smirk. Then, he chuckled a bit, turned around, and walked back to his throne, which had just appeared behind him. He sat down and looked at Alex again with a smirk, just like back when Alex had first arrived here.\nAlex remained silent for a couple of seconds as he calmed down, trying to analyze the situation.\n'Obviously, this isn't a dream. The pain is too real, and now that I take the possibility that this is real into account, I also notice that my thoughts are too orderly. Usually, in a dream, I never notice that it's a dream since a big part of my brain is asleep.'\n'I have to throw these preconceived notions of what counts as reality out of my mind and learn to accept that this is all real.'\nAlex looked at the man sitting in front of him.\n'And that means that he's also real. What is he? He can't be a normal human.'\n\"Finally, you are actually thinking about your current situation,\" the man said. \"Took you long enough.\"\nNow that Alex was calming down, he also noticed that this man had reacted to his thoughts several times.\n'Does this mean that he can read my mind?'\n\"Yes, I can,\" the man said. \"A mortal human life might be beyond complex for you, but for me, it's not very complicated. Your mind and soul follow rules, and when something follows rules, you can extrapolate what this something does at any given time, assuming you have the processing power to take everything into account.\"\nAlex took a deep breath.\nToo many strange things had happened in these past minutes, and he couldn't be sure about anything except that his life was probably about to change severely.\n\"What happened?\" Alex asked, calmer than before. By now, he had realized that this young man didn't want to kill or torture him. Otherwise, the young man wouldn't have spent so much time trying to demonstrate that Alex was actually here, in reality.\n\"Look at you,\" the young man said with a smirk. \"You know that this is reality, and you know that my power far eclipses your own. You know that I could kill you like a fly if I so wanted to.\"\n\"Yet, you are not bowing down or licking my boots,\" the young man said with a chuckle. \"Instead, you are still talking to me like we are equals.\"\nThe smirk of the young man widened. \"I really made a good catch today.\"\nAlex furrowed his brows. \"Okay, but what happened?\" Alex asked again.\nThe young man chuckled and leaned back on his throne. \"Death,\" he said.\nWhoom!\nSuddenly, the hall vanished as Alex appeared in a dark alleyway.\nFor a second, Alex thought that he had just dreamed all of this, but that thought quickly died when he noticed the gigantic throne in the alleyway with the man sitting on it.\n\"This is where you died,\" the man said as he gestured to the ground.\nAlex took a deep breath and looked down.\nWhat he saw made his insides shudder.\nIn front of him, in the dark alleyway, were two corpses.\nAll of Alex's memories of his death immediately returned.\nOne corpse was of the man he had accidentally killed, while the other corpse belonged to Alex. Currently, only these two corpses lay in the alleyway. The injured dog had either fallen asleep, had died, or had lost consciousness. Alex wasn't sure.\n\"How did I die?\" Alex asked. He couldn't remember what had killed him but judging by the appearance of the back of his own head, he could make a guess.\n\"Your victim had a friend for insurance in case something went wrong,\" the young man explained. \"When he saw you kill his friend, he charged over with a crowbar, and well, you can imagine the rest.\"\nAlex looked at the two corpses with a complex expression.\n\"Ironic, isn't it?\" the young man asked. \"Your opponent died from a hit to the head, while you also died from a hit to the head. You died the same way as the person you've killed.\"\n\"I didn't want this,\" Alex said slowly. \"I didn't want to kill him. I only wanted to incapacitate him.\"\nThe young man chuckled. \"And that's exactly why this situation is so entertaining. There are so many people willing to kill someone, and such a thing is simple. However, when you accidentally kill someone, the entire situation has a different taste.\"\n\"Now, there is complexity. Now, there is no one you can truly blame. A tragedy has happened, but no one is at fault, no one to get angry at.\"\n\"What will the family of this young man do? Will they blame you? However, you have also died, and you also were in a dangerous situation. They can't blame you. Will they blame the young man for his actions? A little, but does something like this warrant an immediate death?\"\nThe young man chuckled again. \"There's no easy way out of this situation. That's what makes this so interesting.\"\n\"What will happen now?\" Alex asked.\n\"Well, your corpses will remain there for the entire night since not many people pass through here during the night,\" the young man explained. \"A middle-aged woman on the phone will notice your corpses in the morning and will call the police.\"\nAt that point, the young man furrowed his brows and moved his fingers a little bit. This gesture reminded Alex of someone that was calculating something in their head.\n\"Your killer will flee into a different city, relatively far from here,\" the young man said absentmindedly. \"However, he will be caught in about four weeks. Then, he will stand trial for first-degree murder, but he will only be convicted of second-degree murder since he killed you out of revenge.\"\n\"He will get a sentence of 25 years.\"\nAt that point, the young man's speech became slower as he concentrated more.\n\"After he finished his sentence, he will get back to the street and will eventually die of an overdose.\"\nThe young man relaxed again as he leaned back.\nMeanwhile, Alex took a deep breath.\nObviously, the young man didn't know the future. Otherwise, he could have said everything in an instant. If one were able to see the future, one wouldn't have to think so hard.\nThis meant that the young man had simply calculated everything.\nHowever, that was even more terrifying.\nWhoop!\nReality changed again as they returned to the grand hall.\n\"Anyway, back to the topic,\" the young man said. \"While you were busy killing and getting killed, I was searching for a suitable candidate. I found about 2,000 fitting people on earth, and I chose you because you were simply the first one that would kick the bucket. If you had died just a couple days later, you wouldn't have arrived here.\"\n\"Isn't that lucky?\" the young man asked with a smirk.\nAlex took another deep breath. He had to adapt to his new situation.\nYes, he had died, and he was supposed to enter the afterlife. However, this \"person\" had brought him here.\nAlex had to look forward now instead of backward.\n\"Candidate for what?\" Alex asked.\n\"As I've said, changing the world,\" the young man repeated.\nAlex's eyes narrowed.\n\"Which world?\" he asked.\nThe smirk of the young man widened. \"Aren't you a smart one?\" he asked. \"I'm a bit surprised that you caught on this quickly.\"\n\"Don't you have the ability to calculate everything?\" Alex asked. \"Why would you be surprised about my actions then?\"\nThe young man chuckled. \"Yes, I do have that ability, but I slightly bent the rules for you,\" he said. \"I put a small layer of protection on you that makes it impossible for me to calculate your future. I can still see what you are currently thinking, but I can't see what you will think or do next.\"\nThe young man leaned back again. \"Of course, I can destroy that layer of protection whenever I want, but where's the fun in that?\"\n\"I don't want to immediately know what you will do. I want to see it and get surprised,\" the young man said.\nAlex nodded. \"I can understand that,\" he said. \"So, which world?\"\n\"My world,\" the young man said. \"My main world, I mean, not earth.\"\nAlex looked at the young man for some seconds.\n\"Your world?\" he asked. \"I assume that means that you are some sort of God, right?\"\n\"Exactly,\" the young man said as he leaned his head on his right hand. \"I created a world where everyone can reach supreme power. I added a peculiar type of energy into the make-up of the world that can be absorbed by living beings, severely increasing their power.\"\n\"In theory, you could even reach my level in that world,\" the young man said.\nAlex immediately made several connections in his head.\n'Sounds like some kind of fantasy world, like in an anime or a game,' he thought.\nThe young man chuckled. \"Yes, you could look at it like that,\" he said.\n\"And how am I supposed to change this world?\" Alex asked. \"I'm only a normal man, not a God, like you.\"\n\"Now, we're getting to the interesting part,\" the young man said.",

      "content": "Chapter 5 - Mages\nAlex looked with a complex expression at the young man.\nChanging a world filled with people that could become as powerful as this God right before him?\nHow?\nHe was only a mortal.\n\"Now, don't be hasty,\" the young man said with a smirk as he read Alex's mind again. \"Right now, you are like a child hearing that they have to lead their father's company in the future. Of course everything will appear like it's too much.\"\n\"In fact, you don't have to do much at all.\"\n\"You only have to become stronger.\"\n\"That's it.\"\nAlex furrowed his brows. \"That's it? But you said I'm supposed to change the world.\"\n\"Correct,\" the young man said as he leaned back again. \"However, you becoming powerful is exactly what will change the world.\"\n\"Could you stop talking in riddles and just directly tell me what you want me to do?\" Alex asked.\nThe young man snickered. \"Sure.\"\n\"I already told you a little bit about my main world,\" the young man said. \"To repeat, my world allows someone to reach supreme power by increasing the power of your body and mind.\"\n\"There are innumerable ways to supreme power. You can use the inherent energy in the air to increase the power of your mind. This strengthens your soul, and the more powerful your soul gets, the more powerful your mental abilities become. You can crush elephants with just your mind or move the energy of the world in such a way that it creates powerful destructive forces.\"\n\"However, you can also focus on strengthening your body. By absorbing the energy in the atmosphere and fusing it with your body, you can become so fast and so powerful that the other person that trains their mind wouldn't even be able to react to an attack of yours.\"\n\"You can also fuse with some ethereal concepts and summon them.\"\n\"You can also concentrate on weapons, which allows you to sunder reality with a move of your weapon.\"\n\"You can also comprehend the concepts of how the world works and manipulate the energy in such a way that it imitates these concepts. You would gain control over fire, gravity, time, space, water, metal, life, and so on.\"\n\"You can even just purely absorb Energy without end, becoming a walking bomb that could unleash many years of accumulated power in a single strike.\"\nAlex listened intently.\nAll of this sounded too magical.\nIn fact, it sounded more like a game with different classes. All the classes could become about equally powerful near the end of a game via their own ways.\nThe young man laughed. \"Yes, you could also view it as a game. However, remember, this is reality, not a game.\"\nAlex nodded.\n\"So, in short, there are innumerable ways to power,\" the young man said.\nThen, he paused.\nAlex looked at the young man as his brows furrowed.\nAfter that, his nose wrinkled in disgust.\n\"Anyway,\" the young man said as he looked at Alex again, not as chipper as before. \"I have implemented all these different paths to power. Over time, humanity slowly began to discover all these different paths, and the peak powers of humanity became more and more powerful.\"\n\"Everything was going well, and I had a hell of a time watching the different paths of power fight each other.\"\nThen, the young man gritted his teeth.\n\"And that's when he showed up,\" the young man said with disgust.\n\"Who?\" Alex asked.\nSHING! Thump!\nA bright light shone for a short moment in front of Alex, and he heard the sound of something hitting the floor.\nAlex looked over, and he took a deep breath.\nIt was the naked corpse of a young man!\n\"This guy,\" the young man repeated with hatred. \"The so-called Mage Emperor!\"\n'Mage Emperor?' Alex thought as he looked at the naked corpse.\n\"One of the paths to power I created was the path of magic,\" the young man explained. \"This was also the first example I gave you when I described some paths to power in my world.\"\nAlex felt a bit awkward talking with the young man while a naked corpse was lying beside them. \"You mean the ones that use the energy to increase the power of their mind and soul?\" Alex asked as he looked at the corpse with discomfort.\n\"Yes,\" the young man answered neutrally. \"Just like everyone else, the Mages sought supremacy over everyone, but they weren't really any more powerful than the others.\"\n\"That was until the Mage Emperor appeared,\" the young man spat in disgust while giving the corpse a side-eye. \"He became the most powerful person in the world, but instead of furthering his own power even more, he concentrated on making the path of Magic supreme.\"\n\"So, he killed all the most powerful people of the other paths of power,\" the young man said with some anger. \"Even more, after he killed the most powerful people, he ordered the other mages to kill everyone else that has reached a sufficient standard of power without practicing Magic!\"\n\"In just some few short years, this fucking guy ruined thousands of years of progress!\" the young man shouted as he glared at the corpse of burning eyes.\nThe young man stood up as he paced around in anger.\nAlex kept to himself, not saying or thinking anything.\nBy now, Alex had realized that this God was very easy to anger.\n\"Do you know how fucking boring the world has been ever since then?!\" the young man shouted as he glared at Alex.\nAlex quickly shook his head.\n\"Only Mages are left, and the path of Magic is the only known path to true power,\" the young man said with frustration. \"If anyone wants power, they simply join the mages. Path of least resistance, you know?\"\n\"Why try anything new when you already know of a way to get what you want?\" the young man parroted with anger and annoyance. \"Why go through that hassle, huh?\"\n\"Even people that try to make the other paths to power work will eventually give up and join the Mages after realizing that their progress isn't fast enough. No shit your progress isn't fast! You are blazing a brand-new path on your own!\"\n\"And the worst thing is that the Mages aren't even suppressing the other paths to power!\" the young man shouted. \"They don't even need to! Everyone joins them eventually! Well, no shit! You have thousands of years of refined Spells, Techniques, and Crafts while everyone else has fuck-all due to your purge in the past. Of course they're running towards you in droves!\"\n\"My entire fucking world is filled with nothing but Mages, and battles amongst Mages are one of the most boring ones in existence!\" the young man shouted. \"You ever seen people just flinging stuff at each other from a distance for hours on end? Shit's boring as fuck!\"\nThe young man's pacing accelerated.\n\"I'm bored as shit watching my own fucking world when it's supposed to bring me entertainment!\"\n\"And it's all this asshole's fault!\"\nBANG! BOOOM!\nThe young man kicked the corpse in rage, and the corpse flew with insane speeds at the wall, which promptly exploded.\nAlex took a deep breath.\nAfter kicking the corpse, the young man seemed to feel better, and an evil smirk appeared on his face.\n\"You should've seen him when he came into my palace like he owned the place,\" the young man said.\n\"Back then, I was looking rather favorably upon him since he managed to become quite powerful. I assumed that the other paths to power would recover with time.\"\n\"Yet, that idiot just had to act like he owned the place and told me to make space for him.\"\nSHING!\nThe naked corpse appeared in front of the young man again, uninjured.\nBANG!\nAnother kick, another explosion at the wall.\n\"Just like right now, I kicked him around the room until he eventually died,\" the young man said with a genuinely malicious grin. \"It took hours, but he still eventually succumbed to his ever-increasing count and severity of injuries.\"\nAlex remained completely silent.\nThis guy was dangerous!\nThe young man took a deep breath and looked at Alex again.\n\"Anyway, that's where you come into play,\" he said, \"someone that has the guts and drive to become truly powerful.\"\n\"I will send you into my world with a body that is unable to practice Magic. However, you are a person that wants to become more powerful, someone that chases power. If Magic doesn't work for you, you will find another way.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"And that's your entire job,\" the young man said with a smirk as he sat down on his throne again.\n\"Simply be yourself in my world. Do whatever the fuck you want. It doesn't matter because, in the end, you will chase power no matter what, and you will have to do it with something that isn't Magic.\"\n\"That's all you have to do.\"\nAlex thought about the young man's words as he furrowed his brows.\nBecoming as powerful as this God in front of him?\nThat didn't sound bad.\nA world where people actually truly fought each other?\nThat didn't sound bad.\nBeing able to feel himself becoming more powerful and being able to push himself to his limits yet again with a new body?\nThat didn't sound bad.\nHowever, Alex still sighed.\n'I want to actually go through with this, but it somehow feels weird since it feels like I didn't have a choice in the matter.'\n\"Pfft!\" the young man spat with a short laugh. \"No choice? That's your issue?\"\n\"Alright, then let me give you a choice.\"\n\"Go back to your world and join the afterlife or come to my world. You can decide for yourself.\"\nAlex thought about his old world and his family that he had left behind.\nHe missed them.\nHowever, he had already died.\nThere was no way that this God would resurrect him.\nHe had lost them anyway.\nAlex sighed again.\nThe God had given him a choice, but it wasn't truly a choice since Alex's decision had already been made before the choice had even existed.\n\"Finally done with those useless thoughts?\" the young man asked with a smirk.\nAlex looked at the naked corpse for a second.\nThen, he turned to the young man and nodded.\nA new life was about to begin for him.\n\"Not so fast!\" the young man shouted. \"Don't get ahead of yourself. Before you join my world, I need to give you a helping hand.\"\nAlex's right eyebrow rose. \"A helping hand?\"\n\"Yes,\" the young man said with a satisfied smirk as he leaned back.\n\"I have three presents for you that will make your journey to power far easier.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 6 - Shang\n\"Three presents?\" Alex asked with a raised brow.\n\"Yes, three presents,\" the young man answered as he leaned back on his throne with a smirk. \"The strongest person that isn't following the path of magic has only barely reached the fourth Realm while there are many more Realms to go.\"\n\"You don't have any inheritance for techniques or any other person that can help you when you reach the third Realm. The first couple of Realms are still fine, but you will have to blaze your own path starting at the third Realm.\"\n\"So, you'll need some help. Otherwise, it would become impossible for you to reach any significant level of power.\"\nAlex sighed.\n'No help, huh?' Alex thought. 'I have to create my very own path to power.'\nAlex looked at the young man for a couple of seconds as the young man only smirked back.\nAlex's body shook slightly.\n'Nothing to rely on. No person I can ask for pointers.'\n'Everything is all on me.'\n'That actually sounds exciting!'\nYes, Alex's body was not shaking out of fear or anxiety but out of excitement!\nAlex hadn't played many games in the past, but just like many other people, Alex also wanted his life to be filled with a bit more excitement.\nThe mundane greyness and sterile systems in his old world were too boring.\nTwo fists couldn't beat four hands.\nThis was an old phrase that Alex had heard from one of his coaches in the past. It meant that numbers always beat individual strength.\nA top-tier fighter might be able to win against two, three, or maybe even four people at once in a battle, but ten? A hundred? A thousand?\nImpossible.\nJust by piling onto the fighter with their bodyweight would allow the mass of enemies to make the fighter helpless since there was only so much muscle a man could have. One man couldn't resist hundreds of kilograms of weight pressing down on their body.\nAlex looked at the young man.\n'However, is that still true for him?' Alex thought. 'Would the numbers of normal humans even matter when they can't even get through his skin? Would the numbers matter when he can just kill everyone with a casual wave of his hand?'\n'Fighting has always been a lifestyle of mine, but as long as I'm not in top form, and as long as I'm not in the top 1% of fighters, I can't make a living out of it.'\n'Even more, a single slight injury might make it impossible for me to fight again in the future.'\n'However, in this world, I can break these known conventions! I can achieve true power!'\n\"Tell me,\" Alex said with a seemingly calm voice. However, even he could hear the slight tremble in his own voice.\nThe young man only snickered a bit. However, he didn't comment on Alex's thoughts.\nAfter all, he had told Alex more than once that he was perfectly suited for his world.\nSHING!\nA white light shone briefly, and a black cube appeared in front of Alex, floating in the air.\n\"This is your weapon,\" the young man explained.\nAlex took ahold of the cube, and his body nearly fell over.\nThis cube was heavy!\n\"It doesn't look like a weapon,\" Alex said with furrowed brows.\n\"That's because it doesn't know what path you're choosing yet,\" the young man said. \"Whenever you decide on your own path to power, tell the cube what it should become, and it will assume that form. Keep in mind that this form is permanent and that it can't be easily altered in the future.\"\n\"Why a weapon?\" Alex asked as he looked at the cube.\n\"Because there are no smiths in the world that know how to make powerful weapons that are not Mage weapons. At some point, you would need to create your own weapon if you follow a path that requires one. If you had to do that, you would need to blaze two new paths instead of one. We can't make things too hard on you now, can we?\" the young man explained with a grin.\nAlex immediately noticed a problem. \"So, I either can't use this weapon now, or it will also become useless in the future. After all, weapons are not created equal.\"\nThe young man chuckled a bit. \"This one is,\" he said.\nAlex blinked twice in confusion.\n\"It can grow by absorbing powerful metal,\" he explained. \"In the beginning, it won't be much better than a regular sword or regular spear, but as long as you give it great materials, it will become more powerful.\"\n\"In short, this weapon will accompany you for the rest of your life, no matter how powerful you will become.\"\nAlex looked at the cube with newfound appreciation.\n'That really sounds magical. However, that's expected since I'm entering a world filled with Mages.'\nThe young man frowned when he read Alex's thoughts. The fact that his world was filled with nothing but Mages was a sore spot for him.\n\"Your next present is a separate space,\" he said. \"This space acts as a world of its own, but a far smaller one. Don't bother looking for it since you can't use it yet. Wait until you reach the second Realm. Everything about this space will be explained to you then.\"\nAlex nodded. Having some kind of extra dimension or something sounded quite useful. Additionally, Alex was sure that this separate space was not so simple. There were probably more things it could do.\n\"And as for your third and last present,\" the young man said as he leaned back on his throne again with a smirk.\n\"You get to ask me nine questions in total, and I will answer them honestly,\" he said.\nAlex looked at the young man with surprise.\nHe could ask a God nine questions in total?\nDid this mean that he could ask about the origins of the world?\nCould he ask about some secret techniques only the God knew?\n\"Yes, you can,\" the young man answered.\n\"However!\" he shouted. \"You don't get to remember your questions and answers immediately.\"\nAlex frowned. \"What do you mean?\"\nThe young man only grinned. \"One question and one answer per major breakthrough,\" the young man said. \"You get to ask nine questions since my world has nine Realms of power. You get to ask all these questions now, but the memories of them will only be unlocked as your strength increases.\"\nAlex took a deep breath.\nThis revelation changed the entire meaning of these questions.\nInitially, Alex had been interested in how the world worked to satiate his curiosity, but now, these questions could help his future self.\nAlex knew that becoming truly powerful was nearly impossible. After all, how many supremely powerful people existed in that world? Alex wasn't so arrogant that he believed that he could easily achieve something that millions of people couldn't.\nAlex remained silent for several minutes as he thought about what he should ask.\nThe young man didn't move during all of this time.\n\"Alright,\" Alex said after some minutes. \"For my first question: What would be the optimal way to start my journey to power?\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The question had been asked, and Alex had sacrificed this question for his future.\n\"That's a smart question,\" the young man said, pleased.\n\"First of all, you need the basics. You need sufficient physical strength, sufficient mental strength, sufficient Mana, and sufficient combat experience.\"\n\"In order to get sufficient physical strength, you need to follow a specific routine: Train your physical body until it's completely destroyed. After that, relax, close your eyes, and absorb the energy in the atmosphere. Due to your special constitution that makes practicing Magic impossible, the energy won't enter your soul but your body. Your body will be strengthened, and it will regenerate.\"\n\"This routine will also help you in achieving sufficient Mana and sufficient mental strength. By absorbing the energy in the atmosphere, the stuff that people in my world call Mana, your Mana storage will increase. At the same time, breaking your body more and more will increase your willpower while the absorption of Mana will have a nourishing effect on your mind.\"\n\"In order to gain sufficient combat experience, I would advise you to live in the wilderness close to the village I'm sending you. Try to survive there without any human help. If you feel like you are not in danger anymore, go further into the wild and survive there. Power is gained amongst danger.\"\n\"Follow these things for the next two years, and you should be ready to join human society again. When you've done all that, search for an academy in the nearby towns. Don't worry, there will be an academy that's just perfect for someone like you.\"\n\"And that's all,\" the young man said with a grin. \"That should give you the optimal start in your journey.\"\nAlex took all of this in.\n\"Alright, then for my second question…\"\nTHWAP!\nAlex's body suddenly jerked, and he felt like his mind had been hit with a hammer.\nHe looked around, and he saw that he was still standing in the hall. The young man was also in front of him.\nHowever, the young man was laughing hysterically.\n\"What happened?\" Alex asked in confusion.\nThe young man calmed down, but his face was filled with amusement.\n\"You've just asked your last question, and man, your last question was a doozy!\" he said with a snicker.\nFor a second, Alex wanted to ask what he was talking about, but then he remembered that he would lose part of his memories.\nApparently, that had already happened.\n\"Because of your last question, I've changed a couple of things,\" the young man said as his grin widened in excitement. \"Originally, I didn't want to give you an elemental affinity. After all, it would be a bit pointless since you can't practice Magic.\"\n\"However, your last question threw all of these plans out of the window,\" the young man shouted with excitement. \"Now, I'm giving you a special affinity, and you might even be able to use it if you train hard enough. Who knows?\"\nAlex was still confused since he felt like he had been transported into the future.\n\"Additionally!\" the young man shouted as he grinned widely. \"You will get a new name!\"\nAlex blinked a couple of times. \"New name? Why?\"\n\"Because I say so!\" the young man shouted with a laugh. \"Parents have the right to give their children a name, and you will receive a brand-new body that I have given life to! In essence, I am somewhat your father. Therefore, I get to choose a new name for you!\"\nAlex really didn't like hearing that.\nHe had gone his entire life by Alex.\nSuddenly changing it sounded… weird.\n\"I don't care!\" the young man shouted. However, he didn't seem angry at all.\nInstead, he actually appeared madly excited.\nIt was like he was about to see the greatest show of his life.\n\"You will use this name! You will be forced to use this name! Whenever you use your old name, you will feel pain!\"\nAlex really didn't want that.\nYet, the God didn't care.\n\"From today onward, your name is Shang!\"\n\"Remember your name, Shang!\"\n'Shang?' Alex thought. 'That's a weird na-'\nSHING!\nAnd Alex was gone.\nHe had been teleported to his new world.\nThe young man leaned back with a snicker.\n\"Oh, this is going to be great,\" he said to himself with a smirk.",

      "content": "Chapter 7 - New Body And New Surroundings\nThunk!\nAlex's mind was thrown into disarray suddenly. It was like he had just received a punch to the head.\nAlex's hand went to his butt out of reflex since he felt some pain coming from it.\nThat's when he felt grass.\n'Grass?' Alex thought.\nAlex opened his eyes and looked around.\nForest.\nThis was the only word that appeared in his mind when he saw his new surroundings. Thick pine trees were all around Alex. Alex could hear some birds chirping, and he heard the buzzing of insects. The smell of nature also immediately assaulted him.\n'Sure enough, I have been sent somewhere, probably that God's main world or something,' Alex thought as he looked around.\nAlex stood up, and while doing so, immediately noticed something peculiar.\n'Standing up is easier than before,' Alex thought.\nAlex looked down at his body, and his brows furrowed.\n'My big belly is gone,' Alex thought.\nAs Alex looked at his own body, he noticed that he had a slim build. On top of that, he wore different clothes now.\nRight now, Alex wore black cloth pants and a black shirt.\nSurprisingly, the fabric felt rather nice.\nHowever, Alex noticed something else that he didn't like one bit.\n'I'm smaller,' Alex thought with narrowed eyes.\nPreviously, Alex had been 187 centimeters tall, but now, he barely reached 160 centimeters, according to his estimations.\nAlex touched his face and noticed that it was also rather slim.\n'I'm smaller, my unnecessary fat is gone, but my muscles are also gone,' Alex thought. 'This is either the body of someone that only does cardio, or I'm in the body of a teenager. I don't think that this God would send me into a grown body that's only 160 centimeters tall. After all, he wants me to become powerful, and height is an insane advantage in physical combat.'\n'So, I'm probably in the body of a teenager. Assuming that I will reach a height of above 180 centimeters in my adulthood, my current height of 160 centimeters means that I still have quite some growing to do.'\n'This means that I'm probably in the body of a 14-year-old,' Alex thought.\nSomething on Alex's head tickled him, and he moved it to the side.\nIt was hair, and when Alex noticed some strands of his hair, he also noticed a different change.\n'Well, seems like my blonde hair is gone,' Alex lamented as he saw his new black hair.\nAfter getting familiar with his new body, Alex looked around himself and noticed two things.\nOne was a bulging sack, and the other was the black cube the God had given him.\nAlex opened the bag and looked inside. These were probably some basic things that the God had prepared for him.\n'Clothes, three red flasks, a survival knife, shoes, and some meat jerky,' Alex thought as he looked at the sack. 'Basically, the bare necessities to survive in the wilderness.'\nAlex took out one of the three red flasks and looked at it. The color of the liquid in the flask was a vibrant red, and the liquid was rather viscous. 'Could these be health potions? I mean, I kind of am in a fantasy world.'\nAlex wasn't sure, but he assumed that he was right.\nAfter checking his inventory, Alex picked up the black cube and put it in the bag.\nHowever, his hand halted as he realized something else.\n'Did the black cube become lighter?' he thought as he moved the black cube around a bit. 'Probably not, but it does feel lighter.'\nAlex frowned as his mind tried to find the reason. 'My old body was out of shape, but I still had quite some muscle. Yet, this untrained teenage body can easily carry the cube.'\nAlex scratched his chin in thought. 'Is this normal? Is this the effect of being in a world that's bathed in this mysterious energy that's all around me in the air? The guy said that most people call it Mana, so I should probably also get used to calling it Mana. I don't want to appear out of place.'\n'Possible,' Alex thought. 'I should test that. The guy said that I can't push Mana into my soul, which means that something in my body is different from a normal human body. The inability to do something that everyone else can do basically means that I'm disabled in a certain sense.'\n'However, the God wouldn't send me into a body that can't become more powerful. He also said that most of my Mana will end up in my body.'\nAlex quickly shook his head. 'Now's not the time to think about these things, Alex! First, you need-'\nAlex stopped thinking as his head was suddenly droning. It felt like he had gotten a migraine.\n'What's going on now!? Can't you give me a break!?'\nHowever, the headache only increased, and Alex fell to his knees as he breathed heavily.\nHis mind was going through everything that the God had told him, and Alex quickly found the answer.\n'Really?' Alex thought with frustration and anger. 'You won't even allow me to think of my true name?!'\nNo answer.\n'Fine, fine. I'm Shang!'\nAnd just like that, the headache had vanished.\n'So, it really is like this,' Alex thought with a bitter expression. 'Fuck, this is so annoying! Can't even retain my own name!'\nHowever, there was nothing that Alex or Shang could do.\n'Anyway, I should first look around for a safe spot. I don't know where I am, and if I start training now, unwelcome visitors might suddenly appear.'\nAlex looked around. 'There are no leaf trees and only pine trees. Does this mean that I'm in a colder climate? Now that I think about it, the sun is high in the sky, but it's a bit chilly. I can still deal with this temperature, but it will probably drop significantly in the evening and night.'\n'I have food for about a day in my sack, and I can use my spare clothes for bedding and a blanket. However, I should still find a safe place where I can sleep.'\n'Let's check from above,' Alex thought as he looked at a tall tree beside him. 'With this body, I should be able to climb this tree.'\nAlex put his sack down and went to the tree, but he quickly stopped.\nThen, he slung the sack over his back.\n'Animals might smell the jerky in there,' he thought.\nAfter that, Alex went to the tree and slung his arms and legs around it.\n'Sure enough, I can easily support my own weight. This body is quite powerful and still pretty light. I don't want to admit it, but this body is probably even better suited for survival and combat than my old one.'\nThe first couple of meters were a bit difficult, but after Alex reached the height of the branches, it became far easier. The needles of the pine tree were a bit annoying, but they didn't injure him.\nAround two minutes later, Alex was relatively high up and could see around him.\n'Fuck!' Alex thought with gritted teeth. 'Forest everywhere!'\nAlex was on top of a sea of green.\n'Well, at least I can somewhat make out the terrain.'\nAlex noticed several mountains on the horizon, probably 20 kilometers away or so. According to his estimations, the mountains were probably about a kilometer tall on average.\nAlex turned his head and noticed that the mountains were encircling him from quite a distance.\n'Is this a basin?' Alex thought. 'I can't see anything higher behind the mountains, which probably means that I'm probably not below sea level. I'm probably just surrounded by mountains. Quite an interesting starting location.'\nAlex got an idea, and a skeptical expression appeared on his face.\n'Is this supposed to be some kind of tutorial area or starter location?' Alex thought.\nAlex scratched the back of his head awkwardly when he had that thought.\nThis wasn't a game, but the God sure as hell structured it like one. Alex even got three healing potions.\n'I mean, at least this makes things easier,' Alex thought. 'He told me that I should try surviving in the wilderness, and when I no longer feel any danger, I should go further in. I guess he meant this basin.'\nThen, Alex noticed something.\n'Smoke!'\nThere was smoke coming from behind one of the mountains! It was hard to notice, but if one looked hard enough, one would see it.\n'That's probably a village, and they're living just beyond that mountain!'\nThis did a lot for calming Alex's anxiety.\nAt least he knew where he could find humans.\nRustle, rustle.\nAlex heard the sound of rustling coming from a distance, and he looked over.\nAlex blinked a couple of times in confusion as he tried to process what he was seeing.\nWere these trees… moving?\nYes, sure enough, about a hundred meters away, about twenty pine trees were moving from left to right.\nOne peculiar thing was that these trees were all very close to each other, even closer than the other trees. On top of that, some of them were slanted at an angle.\nAlex squinted his eyes as he tried to see what was going on over there.\nTrees couldn't just move like that.\n'Wait, are these actually trees?' Alex thought.\nAfter a closer inspection, Alex noticed that these \"trees\" only resembled trees. They weren't actually trees.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ They looked more like green spires with some green spikes coming out from their side.\nThis picture reminded him of something.\nIf these spires were straight, had no spikes, and were black…\nAlex took a deep breath in shock.\n'Is that a green hedgehog!?'\nSure enough, the moving mass of green looked like the back of a hedgehog.\nHowever, just how big was this thing!?\n'If that's a hedgehog, it means that it's so big that its needles are nearly as tall as pine trees!'\nAlex remained quiet as he watched the mass of green spires moving past the trees. Sometimes, they were caught on a tree and bent backward, but after a while, they simply bounced back to their original location.\nIf this was a hedgehog, it was probably just as big as an elephant without its needles!\nBANG!\nSuddenly, Alex heard the sound of something heavy hitting the ground, and it sounded like it came from a long distance away.\nAlex looked towards the direction the sound came from and noticed a dust cloud at the bottom of one of the mountains in the distance.\nThere, Alex noticed a brown lizard biting down on some large, brown animal. Alex wasn't sure since it was too far away to see it clearly.\nHowever, Alex did notice one thing.\n'I can see that lizard from here!' he thought with a deep breath. 'Then, how big is that lizard!?'\nFor a while, Alex only remained silent as he tried to come to terms with the things he had witnessed.\n'Are you sure this is a tutorial area!?'",

      "content": "Chapter 8 - Watching\nAlex remained on top of the pine tree for quite a while as he simply looked at his surroundings in shock.\n'These beasts are gigantic!' Alex thought. 'How am I supposed to survive here? If I accidentally get close to any of them, I won't even have a fighting chance!'\n'Although, the God said nothing about killing everything. He simply said that I should remain here until I can survive without feeling much danger.'\n'Is this what he meant with sufficient combat experience? I mean, I guess being able to survive in the wilderness could have its own perks. For example, if I ever get chased by anything or anyone, I would be able to survive.'\n'These aren't the orchestrated fights I'm used to. These are real life-and-death battles, which means that fleeing is a viable strategy. I guess being able to flee is a valuable skill.'\nAlex released a sigh.\n'So, should I search for a cave for the night?' Alex asked himself. 'However, these mountains are around 20 kilometers away from here. If it's a straight and safe street, I could probably get there in half a day with the current fitness of my body. However, my journey there won't be safe, and I definitely need to make several turns.'\n'Yeah, that doesn't work. So, I need an alternative.'\n'Digging is a no-go. After all, I only have a knife. Additionally, the climate is rather cold, which makes the ground harder. On top of that, the ground should be filled with roots.'\nAlex scratched the back of his head.\n'I think that only leaves two things. I either need to find some humongous tree that has a big hole inside it, or I need to sleep on top of trees. Camping outside should be the last option.'\nAlex sighed.\n'Anyway, if I have to sleep on a tree anyway, I don't really have to look for one. These trees are all pretty big, and basically any one of them would do. I only need to cut off the needles and annoying branches.'\nAlex looked up.\n'It should be early afternoon, which means I still have some hours to kill. I should keep watch over my surroundings to see what kind of wildlife I can find. Knowing your enemy is already half the battle.'\nAlex started climbing down the tree but didn't leave it completely.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Instead, Alex waited about five meters above the ground on a thick branch. He shaved off some of the needles of the tree to make himself comfortable.\nBut wait, didn't Alex say that he would look at the wildlife?\nYes, he did, but only an idiot would blindly walk through an unknown forest.\nThis was not earth.\nDangerous animals existed on earth, but they were not everywhere. Additionally, even if one were in an area known to have dangerous animals, these animals wouldn't be everywhere at once. These powerful animals had territories, and they needed a ton of food.\nHowever, here, things could be different. Alex wasn't certain how many dangerous animals there were in this basin, but there probably were a few.\nSo, Alex simply remained on the tree as he looked down. At the same time, Alex tried to be as silent as possible.\nHalf an hour passed, and Alex's ass had already started hurting from sitting like this.\nHowever, waiting like this had paid off.\nRight now, Alex was so relieved that he hadn't left the tree.\nWhy?\nWolf pack.\nThere were four light-grey wolves walking around the tree Alex was currently on.\nThey had obviously smelled him, and they very quickly found Alex as his scent led them to the tree.\nThe wolves looked up at Alex, who was looking down nervously.\n'These wolves are normal sized, but still, they're massive!' Alex thought.\nThese wolves weren't really bigger than their counterparts from earth, but even the wolves on earth could weigh up to 90 to 100 kilograms.\nIn comparison, a german shepherd was only around 30 to 40 kilograms.\nThe wolves started circling the tree, and some of them started clawing at the tree with their paws, but the tree was just too massive.\nSurprisingly, the wolves didn't bark, growl, or howl.\nExcept for the scraping sound of their claws on the tree, they made no other sound.\nAlex's heart was beating quickly, but his head remained calm.\nHe knew that they couldn't get him up here.\n'Light grey, what an interesting color,' Alex thought. 'Wolves are normally brown or dark grey. I think wolves with these lighter colors are mainly in colder environments since their color makes it easier to go unnoticed in the snow.'\n'This confirms it. This is probably a colder region.'\nAfter some minutes, the wolves left again. There was no point in remaining here. It was easier to find a different prey.\nAlex watched the wolves leave with interest. 'They were suspiciously quiet. If they were the rulers of this place, they wouldn't need to be so quiet. This means that there are probably more terrifying beasts lurking around.'\nAlex got reminded of the gigantic green hedgehog and the brown lizard.\n'Obviously,' he added in his thoughts.\nAlex remained on the tree.\nHalf an hour later, Alex saw another animal, and he certainly didn't like seeing that one.\nA hog.\nAlex could only describe the hog's appearance with the word fat.\nIt was nearly as tall as Alex, and it seemed just as wide.\n'Great, a hog,' Alex thought sarcastically with an uncomfortable expression. 'Hogs are fiercely territorial and make a ton of noise when they get angry.'\nThe hog also smelled something when it arrived below Alex's tree, but instead of looking up, it was rummaging through the dirt.\nSurprisingly and contrary to expectation, the hog was quite silent while digging.\nLuckily, the hog didn't notice Alex and quickly left after a bit of searching around.\nTen minutes later, the next animal arrived, and this was an animal that Alex hadn't seen before.\nIt was a sizable green lizard. It was probably nearly a meter high, and it had quite some long legs. Additionally, there were long claws coming out of its long legs.\n'Why are there so many animals here?!' Alex thought. 'Isn't it normal to only see one big animal every couple of hours? Yet, I'm seeing one every ten minutes!'\nThe green lizard seemingly smelled something of interest, and Alex became more nervous.\nThis thing looked like it could climb trees!\nThe lizard smelled the ground with interest, and after a couple seconds, it walked over to a tree and climbed it.\nLuckily, it wasn't Alex's tree.\nWhen Alex saw that, he silently released a sigh of relief.\n'It probably didn't smell me. Otherwise, it would have climbed my tree. It probably smelled the hog.'\nAlex looked at the tree where the lizard was with interest. While climbing it, Alex could still hear it, but after some rustling, everything became silent again.\n'Its legs don't fit an arboreal animal,' Alex thought. 'It probably walks on the ground normally.'\nAlex had a complex expression on his face.\n'So, it's probably on the tree to hunt, right?' Alex thought.\nThe tree was still silent, but Alex couldn't see the lizard through all the green needles blocking his sight.\n'I'm so happy that I didn't walk around aimlessly. Even if I managed to evade all the animals on the ground, I might walk by a tree with exactly such a lizard in it,' Alex thought.\nAlex looked over at the tree as he lay down on the branch. He wanted to remain as hidden as possible.\nUsually, Alex might try to kill it.\nAfter all, he was supposed to grow stronger and gain combat experience.\nThis was a perfect opponent.\nIt wasn't too big, and it was alone.\nHowever, Alex decided against it.\nWhy?\nBecause, after smelling the hog, the lizard waited here in an ambush instead of going someplace else!\nThat hog had been huge!\nIt probably weighed over 300 kilograms!\nHow was a lizard that barely weighed maybe 50 kilograms supposed to kill that thing alone?\nAlex decided that the risk was too high.\nAlex continued waiting, but waiting was much more stressful than before. After all, the lizard was still there.\nEven worse, Alex had heard nothing from the tree for the past twenty minutes. It was almost like the lizard wasn't there anymore.\nAnother twenty minutes later, something walked past Alex's tree again.\nAlex glanced down, and his heart sank.\nIt wasn't the hog.\nThe four wolves were back!",

      "content": "Chapter 9 - First Kill\nAlex became nervous when he saw that the wolves had come back.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ These wolves knew where Alex was, and if that weird lizard saw how these wolves acted up, it might decide to also attack Alex.\nThe wolves walked around, sniffing the ground.\nThen, they turned their attention to the tree Alex was on and walked over.\nAlex's heart beat ferociously as he tried to think of something.\nHe wasn't scared of the wolves. After all, these wolves couldn't climb trees.\nHowever, he was scared of the lizard.\nAlex still tried to hide as well as possible. Doing something stupid now might spell his doom.\nBANG!\nAlex's eyes widened in horror.\nWhat had he just seen?!\nThe wolves immediately released short shouts as they jumped away.\nHowever, only three wolves were left.\nWhy?\nA fireball had flown over to one of the wolves and had exploded!\nThe wolf's body was partially torn apart, and the explosion of the fireball had thrown it against the tree.\nWhere had the fireball come from?\nIt came from the tree where the lizard was supposed to be!\nThe remaining three wolves immediately scattered into all directions, fearful of whatever it was that had killed one of their companions.\nThe last wolf was barely clinging to life, but to no avail. Even if nothing else attacked it anymore, it would still die.\nAlex still could barely believe what he had just seen.\nHad the lizard fired a fireball?\nWas that why it was so confident in taking on the hog?!\nThen, Alex saw the lizard slithering down from its tree as it walked over to the half-dead wolf with its long legs.\nSNAP!\nThe lizard bit down on the wolf's neck, suffocating it slowly.\nSilence.\nAlex saw how the lizard was dealing with the wolf just beside his tree, and Alex became a bit agitated.\nIf he jumped down now, he could take out the lizard and claim both corpses for himself!\nAlex had enough food for a day, but he would need to survive for longer.\nFood was a pressing issue for him right now.\nAlex readied his survival knife as he debated if he should jump down or not.\nBy now, the wolf was no longer moving, but the lizard wanted to make sure that the wolf was dead. Because of that, the lizard continued strangling the wolf.\nAlex continued hesitating.\nAlex readied his knife.\nAnd then, he put it away.\nThe lizard was too dangerous.\nIf the lizard had the ability to shoot fireballs, it might have different abilities as well.\nMaybe its scales were incredibly powerful?\nMaybe its body was far more powerful than it appeared?\nThere were too many unknowns about this lizard.\nCRASH!\nSuddenly, Alex heard something crash through a bush, and he looked over.\nOne of the wolves was back, and it was charging directly at the lizard!\nAlex also quickly noticed that the two other wolves were also charging at the lizard from different sides.\n'They've assessed the danger from a distance and decided that they should try to kill the lizard,' Alex thought with narrowed eyes.\n'This might be my chance to get some food!'\nThe first wolf directly charged at the lizard with its full speed, which was quite impressive.\nThe lizard suddenly hissed loudly as it showed its fangs to the approaching wolf.\nAlex noticed this and quickly made several deductions in his head. If the lizard could quickly kill the approaching wolf, there would be no point in threatening it. This meant that the lizard might have been weakened by the attack it had unleashed previously.\nMaybe the lizard's fireball was similar to a snake's bite? Snakes used their venom only sparingly since it took a lot of energy to create more of it.\nBANG!\nHowever, the wolf received another fireball to the face.\nThis time, Alex had seen the fireball clearly.\nThe fireball had only been about five centimeters across, but it had shot at the wolf with quite some speed. When the fireball hit the wolf, it exploded ferociously.\nHalf of the wolf's head was destroyed, making it fall to the ground, convulsing.\nHowever, something surprising happened.\nThe other two wolves didn't let up!\nThis shocked Alex.\nTwo of their comrades had already died! So, why were they so adamant about taking down the lizard? This wasn't how normal wild animals behaved!\nThe other two wolves reached the lizard, and it sprang back with a violent and shrill hiss.\nThen, chaos broke out.\nThe two wolves violently attacked the lizard as it tried to defend itself with its long claws, tail, and teeth.\n'It can't unleash fireballs anymore,' Alex noticed.\nThe lizard was quite powerful. Every single bite from it echoed throughout the clearing. Its scales also gave it a considerable defense against any attacks. Whenever a wolf bit it, their teeth only barely managed to penetrate the scales.\nYet, the two wolves were faster and more agile. They simply placed themselves at opposite sides of the lizard. Whenever the lizard turned to one wolf, the other one would bite its tail.\nAlex readied himself.\nAlex's heartbeat climbed to ferocious heights.\nAlex had been in a ton of fights in his life, but no fight had been a genuine life-and-death battle until the very last moment of his previous life.\nAlex knew that he was about to risk his life to take another.\nCreeaaak!\nThe branch Alex was currently on creaked as Alex stood up. Yet, the sound of the branch went unheard due to the commotion going on below him.\nThen, Alex jumped.\nTime seemingly stopped for Alex as he fell down.\nNothing below him moved anymore as seconds seemed to take forever to pass.\nCRACK!\nAlex landed on top of the wolf with his knees, and he immediately heard and felt a brutal crack.\nLuckily, this crack didn't come from his own body.\nThe wolf quickly fell to the side due to the force of Alex's fall, and Alex's knee traveled to the wolf's ribcage due to the new angle.\nCRACK!\nThe ribcage gave way beneath Alex's knee, and Alex felt the force of the fall hit his own body.\nLuckily, his body was fit enough to resist a fall from just a couple meters.\nAlex's body was filled with adrenaline, and he immediately grabbed his survival knife and rammed it into the wolf's neck.\nThe knife went into the wolf's neck like it didn't even exist.\nObviously, the knife was not of inferior quality.\nCRSH!\nAlex immediately pulled the knife out from the side, severing the front of the wolf's neck.\nWhile all of this was happening, Alex was keeping tabs on the other two living beings in the area.\nThe other wolf had immediately run away as soon as it saw that it was alone.\nThe lizard chased it for a couple of meters, hissing the entire time.\nWhile Alex was still dealing with the wolf under him, the lizard turned back and looked at him, hissing.\nAlex looked into the lizard's eyes as the wolf died beneath his feet.\nThen, they only stared at each other for five seconds.\nBy now, the wolf's body only convulsed weakly, not being able to do anything else.\nAlex slowly stood up and grabbed the wolf's legs.\nCRRRRRR!\nThe sound of something scraping across the ground was heard as Alex pulled the wolf towards his tree.\nThe lizard continued hissing at Alex while he was doing that.\nThen, the lizard charged at Alex!\nThunk!\nAlex dropped the wolf and charged at the lizard.\nCRK! HISSSSSS!\nThe lizard suddenly stopped its charge as it resumed its hissing.\nWhen Alex saw that the lizard had stopped its charge, Alex also stopped.\nThey stared at each other for several more seconds.\nThe lizard had tried to frighten Alex into running away, and Alex had called that bluff.\nAlex slowly walked back to his prey, looking at the lizard.\nThe lizard continued hissing, but after a couple of seconds, it seemed to calm down.\nIt slowly walked over to its most recent kill and bit down on one of the corpse's legs, looking at Alex the entire time.\nThen, the lizard pulled the corpse away.\nAlex only continued looking at the lizard.\nA couple seconds later, the lizard suddenly changed its hold, bit on the wolf's neck, heaved it up in one motion, and ran away with impressive speed.\n'Sure enough, this lizard isn't simple,' Alex thought with narrowed eyes. 'It should only weigh about 50 kilograms, but it straight-up lifted the about 80 kilograms wolf and ran off with it.'\nSurprisingly, it left behind the other corpse.\nSilence returned to the clearing.\nAlex was slowly calming down as the thick scent of blood appeared in his nose, making him wrinkle his nose.\nThen, Alex started feeling pain coming from his right knee.\nHe moved his leg around a bit, and it felt like his knee was burning.\nLuckily, no bones were loose, and Alex could still move it without problems.\nIt simply hurt a lot.\n'This means my knee isn't broken. Lucky.'\nAlex looked at the darkening sky with narrowed eyes.\n'No time to think about my first kill. I need to bring the corpse to a safe place.'\nAlex looked at his tree.\n'Up the tree would be best.'\nThen, Alex looked at the bleeding corpse.\n'Yet, how do I get it up there?'",

      "content": "Chapter 10 - Mana\nAlex glanced at the horizon and noted that the sun was barely visible.\n'It's already sundown. I'm not sure what manner of creatures travel around at night in this forest, but I don't want to be on the ground while night's out.'\nAlex grabbed the wolf's corpse and lifted it. It was really heavy, but he barely managed to lift it up to his chest. However, it was very exhausting.\nThen, Alex looked at the branches above him.\nThe lowest branch that could support the weight of the wolf was a full meter above him.\n'I might be able to lift the corpse over my head, but I sure as hell can't throw it up there. Jumping is also out of the question. It's simply too heavy.'\n'I need an alternative,' Alex thought as he put the corpse down again.\nAlex paced around as he tried to think of a solution. The forest darkened more as time passed, and Alex became more nervous.\nBy now, the birds had become silent, making the forest appear deathly silent.\nEven the constant buzzing of the insects became quieter until it eventually stopped.\nRight now, the only noise in the forest was Alex's footsteps.\nThen, Alex looked up at the bag in his tree.\n'I have to try it! I can't waste this corpse!'\nAlex quickly climbed up the tree and got his bag.\nAfter opening it, Alex took out all his spare clothes and tied them together. Luckily, he had enough clothes to make quite a long line.\n'If old-timey prisoners can use something like this to escape from prisons, I can use it to pull up a corpse!'\nAlex tied his makeshift rope to the chest of the wolf.\nThen, Alex climbed up to the first branch of the tree and let himself fall down at the other side, holding the rope.\nCRRRR!\nThe rope became taught, and Alex feared that it might snap.\nCRRR!\nThe wolf corpse slightly moved upward but stopped.\n'I'm not heavy enough.'\nAlex climbed up the rope, happy that his body was fit enough to do something like that.\nThen, Alex tugged the rope under his arm and put his feet on the branch.\nAfter that, Alex pushed himself off the branch.\nCRRRR! THUNK!\nThe corpse moved upwards, but one of the knots loosened.\nThe wolf hit the ground, and Alex also fell down.\nLuckily, he managed to protect his head with his arms. He only received a couple of bruises.\nThe falling corpse echoed throughout the forest, making Alex even more nervous.\nWith the current silence of the forest, that sound should have traveled for over a hundred meters!\nHowever, Alex didn't want to give up on the corpse. Food was a necessity!\nAlex repaired the rope and tried again, and this time, no knots loosened. Alex made sure of that!\nAfter the corpse was lifted to a good height, Alex climbed up the branch and pulled up the remaining part. His arms hurt and burned, but he didn't have to pull much since the corpse was already pretty high up.\nJust when he thought that he had to drop the corpse, he managed to grab it with his arms and finished the last pull upward.\nThe branch was creaking under the combined weight of Alex and the corpse, and Alex decided to quickly switch branches. If that branch broke, all his work would have been for nothing!\nThen, Alex sat down at a different branch and breathed heavily as he moved his cramped fingers.\nParts of the skin on his fingers had been nearly shorn off, making them bleed a little bit. However, such an injury would heal very quickly.\n'I hope this was worth it,' Alex thought.\nAs Alex relaxed, he felt his body starting to shiver.\n'It's cold,' he thought. 'It might even reach below freezing later in the night.'\nAlex narrowed his eyes as he looked at the corpse and the makeshift rope.\nThen, he climbed to the other branch, being careful to not break it.\nAfter getting the rope, Alex released the knots and put parts of his clothes on a higher branch, making a makeshift mattress.\nAlex put the other half of the clothes to the side for now. He would make them into a blanket later.\nWhen everything was done, Alex simply sat on his branch, thinking.\n'The issue of food has been solved for now. The issue of warmth should be solved until the weather becomes even colder, which it surely will. What about water?'\nAlex looked at the corpse of the wolf that was bleeding onto the ground.\nAlex's body shivered. 'I'm not so desperate yet. I can think about drinking blood when I'm about to die of thirst.'\nThen, Alex released a sigh.\n'This should be enough for the day,' he thought. 'I should start my expedition tomorrow. Right now, I only need to rest.'\nAlex grabbed the remainder of his now-dirty clothes and wrapped them around himself as he lay down on the branch.\nIt certainly wasn't comfortable.\n'I need to sleep,' he thought, closing his eyes.\nMinutes passed as the events of the day shot through his head. In just a single day, he had died, met a God, went to a new world with a new body, and killed an animal.\nFor the first time, the reality that he would never see his family again hit home.\n'Have you already heard of my death, mom, dad?' Alex thought with pain. 'Do you think I'm in some kind of paradise now?'\nTime passed as Alex's thoughts wandered.\nAn hour later, no light of the sun reached this place anymore.\nHowever, it wasn't as dark as one thought.\nWhy?\nBecause the moon was close to becoming a full moon. The moon cycle wasn't completely there yet, but it was close.\nThe moon illuminated the dark forest, creating foreboding shadows.\nWhen a cold wind blew, these shadows moved in an ominous dance in accordance with the cold whistle of the wind.\nDrip. Drip. Drip.\nThe only sounds besides the rustling of the leaves and the whistle of the wind were the drops of blood from the corpse hitting the ground.\nThen, another sound joined in.\nIt was Alex, sitting up on the branch with furrowed brows.\n'I'm not tired,' he thought. 'So much stuff has happened that my mind just can't calm down. I need to do something to distract myself.'\nAlex sat on his makeshift mattress while his body was wrapped in clothing, looking at the ground. The grass had a silver sheen to it as it was illuminated by the moonlight.\nAlex just sat there.\nDrip. Drip. Drip.\nThe conversation with the God rang through Alex's mind.\nThen, he narrowed his eyes.\n'He said that absorbing the Mana in the air can strengthen me and heal my injuries. I can't train my body right now, but I should be able to do that, at least.'\nThen, Alex closed his eyes as he sat on the branch.\n'There has to be some way to feel the Mana in the air, and there also has to be a way to absorb it.'\nAs Alex sat on the branch with closed eyes, he concentrated on the wind.\nWas there something in the atmosphere?\nIf there was, Alex should be able to feel it in the wind.\nDrip. Drip. Drip.\nThe sounds of dripping blood, the whistling wind, and rustling leaves were the only things that could be heard in the forest.\nOther than that, there was no sound.\nThe rhythmic sounds slowly put Alex in some kind of trance as he felt his mind drifting.\nHe felt like he was touching something fundamental.\nAfter a while, his skin started tickling as Alex felt some of his hairs stand up.\nYes, there was something else in the air!\nIt was hard to describe, but there was something new in the air.\nEarth didn't have anything like this, which made this force that much more pronounced.\nAs Alex connected with the force, he felt it slowly enter his body.\nIt felt… warm.\nIt was like Alex was taking a relaxing bath.\nAlex slowly touched his skin, but it was still cold.\nThe feeling of warmth was apparently only spiritual, not physical.\nSlowly, Alex's mind started to vanish as he fell into a kind of half-sleep.\nHowever, the Mana in the air still entered his body.\nDrip. Drip. Drip.\nDrip. Drip. Drip.\nDrrrr!\nAlex woke up with a start as an unknown sound joined the sounds of the forest.\nAlex looked over at the origin of the sound and realized that his backpack was shaking slightly.\nHe moved over and opened the backpack as silently as possible to investigate the sound.\nAfter some seconds, he found it.\nIt was the black cube, the thing that was supposed to be his future weapon.\nDrip. Drip. Drip.\nAlex looked at the slightly vibrating cube with interest.\n'Why is it shaking?'\nDrrr! Drrr!\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex furrowed his eyebrows.\nThe shaking kind of sounded… urgent.\nDrip. Drip. Splat.\nAlex's eyes widened, and he looked towards the ground.\nThe forest grew darker as it seemingly transformed into a land of death.\nThe moonlight vanished from Alex's eyes as he beheld the thing standing below the corpse of the wolf.\nIt was a being that looked like some sort of panther. However, it had incredibly long forelegs that ended in long claws. This build made it appear more like the thing was pulling itself forward with its forelegs instead of pushing itself with its hindlegs.\nIt was black as the night, and it had white eyes.\nThe most recent drop of blood from the wolf's corpse hadn't hit the ground but the creature's head.\nAll of these things were already terrifying, but there were three more aspects about it that were even more terrifying.\nOne aspect was its sheer size.\nIt was nearly two meters high and probably over four meters long.\nIt was bigger than a tiger!\nAnother aspect was that it had appeared down there without a sound. If it hadn't been hit by the last drop of blood, Alex wouldn't have noticed this gigantic thing below his tree.\nIt was as silent as the night.\nAnd the last aspect?\nThe last aspect was the most terrifying of all.\nThe last aspect was that the creature was facing Alex.\nLooking into his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 11 - Sword\nTime froze for Alex.\nHe only looked into the blank, white eyes of the… creature.\nYes, this was a creature, not an animal.\nJust looking at it filled Alex with terror.\nThis thing differed greatly from a normal animal. Alex wasn't sure what exactly it was, but he felt a definite difference.\nThe green lizard had also felt different from normal animals, and this creature evoked a similar feeling as the lizard.\nHowever, this creature felt far more powerful and far deadlier.\nIt was like the lizard and the creature were not on the same level.\nAn eternity seemed to pass as the two beings only looked at each other.\nSsshhh!\nTime resumed as the creature suddenly jumped at Alex with ferocious speed. The jump made no sound. One could only hear something fast parting the air, nothing more.\nAlex's body reacted instinctively, and Alex let himself fall away from the branch, putting the branch between him and the creature.\nBANG!\nThe creature's left foreleg completely destroyed the thick branch that had been powerful enough to support Alex's full weight for hours.\nCRSH!\nAlex felt a burning pain assault the back of his thighs as muscles and blood were ripped out.\nThe creature had torn off a huge part of Alex's thigh.\nIf the branch hadn't been between them, his legs would have been completely destroyed!\nBANG!\nAlex's back hit the ground, pressuring his lungs, making it impossible to breathe.\nCrsh!\nThe silent sound of wood being crushed could be heard as the creature used its long claws to stick to the tree.\nRight now, Alex lay on the ground, not being able to breathe. His right thigh had a gigantic gash in it.\nMeanwhile, the creature stopped in the tree and looked at Alex.\nThen, it jumped again.\nAlex's mind fell into chaos.\nFor a seemingly long time, his mind couldn't conjure up any rational thoughts as he tried to find a way out of this situation.\nThe distance between Alex and the creature reduced rapidly as the creature opened its mouth, filled with long, terrifying teeth.\nWhen Alex saw the teeth, only two thoughts appeared in his head.\nThe first thought was: Protect!\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex's hands stretched towards the creature in a futile effort to defend himself.\nThe second thought was: Weapon!\nThe image of many weapons shot through Alex's mind, but his mind subconsciously fixated on the image of a sword.\nThe creature reached Alex and bit down.\nSHING!\nTime stopped again.\nAlex looked with terror at his front, right into the creature's white eyes.\nHe… he was still alive!\nAlex quickly noticed why he was still alive.\nA black sword had materialized in Alex's right hand, and the black sword had impaled the creature's head.\nThe creature was already dead.\nThe sword had gone through its brain.\nThe creature had already stopped its own fall before it had tried to bite Alex. Because of that, its weight hadn't pushed Alex away.\nSeveral seconds of silence passed.\n\"Hurgh!\"\nAlex was finally able to breathe again as his lung recovered from the fall.\nAlex only looked with shock at the creature, trying to come to terms with the fact that he had survived.\nSeveral seconds later, Alex pulled himself away and pulled the sword out of the creature's head.\nSHING!\nThen, Alex only looked at the sword.\nIn Alex's desperation, his mind had subconsciously conjured a long and sharp weapon that could be used in one hand.\nThe black cube transformed into a weapon fitting the criteria.\nUnder the moonlight, Alex saw the weapon that would follow him for the rest of his life.\nThe first thought that came to Alex was: Long!\nThe sword was a bit over a meter long, putting it among the longer swords.\nThe second thought was: Thin!\nThe sword was straight as a nail and thin.\nYet, it had two symmetrical edges, separating it from eastern longswords, like katanas.\nIn short, Alex's sword looked like a longer, straight rapier with two edges.\nOne could also say that it looked like a thinner European longsword but with the same width all the way through.\nHowever, its guard was nearly nonexistent, comprising of just a tiny rectangle.\nAlex inspected his weapon as he slowly calmed down.\n'It looks fragile,' Alex thought as he furrowed his brows. 'Such a thin sword would break apart after only a single clash with an actual one.'\nAlex's hand started to shake.\n'However, it's heavy. It's even hard to just hold it in my right hand like this.'\nAlex put the sword down, and its tip slightly cut into the earth.\nUnder the shining moonlight, Alex continued to look at the sword.\nHowever, the more he looked at it, the better it seemed.\n'Actually, I shouldn't impose the logic of my own world into this new world,' Alex thought. 'The guy said that this sword can grow more powerful by absorbing ore. Additionally, I'm not sure if there even exists a material in my old world that can become this heavy with only this bit of volume.'\nAlex's narrowed eyes suddenly had a glint of excitement in them.\n'Actually, if swordsmiths had access to such powerful materials, they might not have made all their swords that thick to begin with. It's already hard enough to wield this sword, even though it's that thin.'\n'I should test it.'\nThen, Alex stood up.\n\"Argh!\"\nHowever, he failed as he sat down again.\nAlex had forgotten that the backside of his right thigh was ravaged. As soon as he had tried to stand up, burning pain shot throughout his whole body.\nUnder immense pain, Alex moved his body as he inspected his thigh.\nWhen Alex saw the injury, he took a deep breath through gritted teeth.\nThe gash was massive!\nHe could even see his own bone!\n'I need to drink the healing potions in my bag!'\nAlex looked up at the tree but remembered that his branch had been completely obliterated.\nAfter looking around the area for a bit, Alex finally spotted his bag under the dim moonlight.\nAlex crawled over, constantly being assaulted by pain.\nA minute later, he arrived beside his back and rummaged through it.\nHowever, when he looked into the bag, a shiver went through his body.\nThe bag was wet, and some red liquid was swimming in the bag.\nThe glass bottles holding the three healing potions had shattered!\n'Fuck!'\nAlex pulled everything solid out of the bag, including the glass splinters.\nThen, he put the bag to his mouth and tried to drink the red liquid in the bottle through his gritted teeth. He did this so that no glass splinters entered his body.\nIt was disgusting!\nThe dirt and dust of the bag mixed with the red liquid, nearly forcing Alex to puke.\nHowever, he forced himself through it.\nPack!\nWhen he was done, Alex threw the bag to the side with disgust.\nSSSSHHHH!\nSuddenly, Alex felt a burning pain shooting throughout his body as the sound of something burning appeared.\nTen seconds later, the sensation disappeared, and Alex took a deep breath.\nThen, Alex inspected his thigh, and his eyes widened when he saw it.\nThe wound was gone!\nIt was completely gone!\nIt was like it had never been there to begin with!\nAlex had expected the red liquid to be some kind of healing potion, but he hadn't expected it to be this effective!\n'Sure enough, anything that a God bestows upon someone can't be simple.'\nAlex tried to stand up, and it went without a hitch.\nIt was like he had never been injured.\nHowever, Alex looked at his bag one last time with regret.\n'I had three of those, but now, all of them are gone,' he thought with lament.\nSadly, there was nothing that Alex could do. So, he gathered all his belongings, including his new sword, and climbed up the tree again.\nHe would test out his new sword tomorrow.\nAs soon as he got to a new branch, Alex sat down, and his eyelids started to fall.\nNow, Alex was truly tired.\nAlex threw one last glance at the massive corpse on the ground, still in disbelief that he had killed such a monster.\n'That thing has to weigh at least 200 kilograms. No matter how hard I'll try, I'll never pull it up the tree.'\n'Sadly, this means that it has to remain on the ground.'\nAlex readied his makeshift bed and laid down. He put his sword over his body to keep himself from turning and subsequently falling to the ground. The weight of the sword put a lot of pressure on him. Additionally, having such a sharp object near him made him nervous about moving.\nHowever, safety was more important than comfort.\nSurprisingly, even under such uncomfortable bedding, sleep came quickly.\nAlex only hoped that there wouldn't appear another surprise this night.\nAnd thus, Alex slept in the new world for the first time.",

      "content": "Chapter 12 - Moment Of Peace\nAlex slowly opened his eyes after an undefined amount of time.\nAt first, Alex shot up in confusion as he saw his unfamiliar surroundings.\nHowever, Alex quickly calmed down as he remembered the last day.\n'Right, I'm not on earth anymore,' Alex thought with a sigh.\n'I thought all of this had only been a dream, but apparently, it wasn't.'\nA wave of melancholy washed over Alex.\nHe would never see his home again.\nHe would never see his family again.\nHowever, Alex's thoughts were stopped as his stomach told him that he should eat something.\n'Should I eat some of the jerky?' Alex thought. 'No, I don't think so. Jerky stays fresh for longer than raw meat. I should keep it for times when I'm actually lacking food.'\nAlex slowly sat up on his branch, and an uncomfortable, stiff pain assaulted him.\n'Oh god,' Alex thought as he touched his back and shoulders. 'Everything's stiff!'\nAlex moved his muscles around while looking at the surroundings.\nIt was already pretty bright. Alex guessed that it was probably around 10 am.\nAfter loosening up for a couple of minutes, Alex jumped down and walked over to the corpse of the creature from the past night.\nWhen Alex saw its corpse, he had to take a deep breath again.\n'Did I really kill that?' he thought.\nEven in death, the creature appeared fearsome and imposing.\n'Anyway, I should make use of its corpse. Who knows, such powerful beasts might have some kind of benefit to the body? I'm not on earth anymore, so it's possible.'\nAlex moved towards the creature while dragging his heavy but thin sword behind him.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex inspected the corpse for a couple of minutes, trying to think of as many ways to use it as possible.\n'Meat for food. Hide for warm clothing. Maybe bones for tools?'\nAlex nodded.\n'Anyways, I should be patient first. I don't know when the next animal will appear in the clearing.'\nAlex postponed the butchering of the corpse and went back to the tree.\nThen, he simply waited.\nIt was important to see how many beasts approached this area.\nYet, surprisingly, the next three hours, not a single animal appeared.\nAlex furrowed his brows. 'It's nearly afternoon, but I haven't seen a single animal. I saw plenty of animals yesterday, but not a single one appeared. I don't think that they only hunt in the evening.'\nAlex had a guess as to why no beasts arrived, but he had to make sure.\nAlex left his tree and walked to a different one about 200 meters away.\nThen, Alex climbed on top of that tree and kept watch again.\nSure enough, 30 minutes later, Alex saw a stag.\nThe stag carefully moved forward, watching its surroundings with great care.\nIt was on its way to the corpse of the creature.\nYet, it suddenly stopped as its nose took several deep whiffs.\nThen, the stag turned around and walked in a different direction, silently but with more hurry.\nAlex smirked.\n'Knew it!'\n'The herbivores can probably smell the terrifying odor of the creature, and their instincts tell them to avoid this area.'\nAlex looked in the direction of the corpse.\n'Does this also work for carnivores? If we were on earth, I would doubt that. A dead animal is a dead animal, but who knows, maybe it's different here?'\nAlex decided to wait longer.\nAnd a little more than an hour later, a lone tiger appeared.\nAlex took a deep breath when he saw the tiger.\n'What are tigers doing here?!' he thought. 'Aren't tigers normally in warmer climates? Although, I've heard of snow leopards. So, maybe there are also big cats in cold climates?'\nHowever, Alex's eyes quickly widened with a gleam when he saw that the tiger also avoided walking towards the corpse.\n'Interesting,' Alex thought as he scratched his chin in thought. 'A tiger should be an apex predator on earth. There's nothing on earth that can make a tiger avoid a part of its forest, except for maybe human settlements.'\nAlex thought back about his encounter with the creature last night.\nHe could understand why the tiger avoided this place.\nTigers were powerful, and they could jump for several meters with some preparation.\nHowever, that thing yesterday had immediately jumped nearly five meters straight into the air. On top of that, the power of its forelegs had been so great that it tore apart the branch Alex had been sitting on like it had been nothing.\nTigers were powerful, but not THAT powerful.\n'Well, if there are infinite ways to reach supreme power as a human, animals can probably become just as powerful.'\nAfter the tiger left, Alex came down from the tree and walked back to his old location.\nThe corpse was still there, and no other animal had arrived.\nThis time, Alex looked at the corpse more closely.\n'It should weigh about 200 kilograms. I think a tiger is also about that heavy, maybe even heavier.'\n'Yet, the physical power of this creature far outweighs the physical power of a tiger.'\nAlex scratched his chin with furrowed brows.\n'Is this the difference between the normal animals and this creature? Normal animals are just like normal humans. In comparison, this creature had already stepped onto the path of power.'\nAlex also remembered the green lizard, which had the uncanny ability to shoot a fireball.\n'I think the lizard had also already stepped onto the path to power. Otherwise, I can't find an explanation for the ability to straight-up shoot a fireball. Even if it had some kind of chemical mixture in its body that allowed it to create fire, just spitting the fire would completely burn its mouth every time.'\n'So, either the lizard's body has some kind of illogical heightened fire resistance, or it created fire a different way.'\nAlex remembered his conversation with the God of this world.\n'The guy said that this world is filled with Mages. Apparently, Mages can manipulate the Mana in the air to harness the destructive forces of nature. Fire should be part of these forces.'\nAlex nodded.\n'I can imagine the lizard doing something similar.'\nAlex's eyes shone with a mixture of curiosity, excitement, and wonder.\n'I also want to do that.'\n'However, that has to wait for now,' Alex thought as he straightened his body. 'Survival comes first.'\n'First, I need water, food, and warmth. I can get a fire going and cook some meat. While the meat is cooking, I can also try to make some kind of long coat out of the creature's fur for warmth. The animals are currently avoiding this area, and I should use the chance.'\nAlex looked towards the distance.\n'I only hope that no beast walks over here that is interested in the corpse of the creature. I only managed to kill the creature due to luck. If I meet it again, it might tear me apart. After all, yesterday, it hadn't seen my sword since it hadn't actually existed yet. However, now, the creature would be able to see my sword. Avoiding it isn't probably very hard for such a creature.'\nAlex gathered some dried twigs and some leaves.\nThen, he tried to start a fire.\nIt definitely wasn't as easy as it appeared on TV, but Alex managed to get a fire going after about an hour of trying.\nWhen he saw the twigs catch fire, Alex felt so incredibly relieved.\nThen, Alex took out his sword and carefully cut off the gigantic pelt of the creature.\nIt was an extremely bloody affair, and the corpse stank to high heaven.\nLuckily, Alex's sword was insanely sharp, making the task far easier.\nAfter that, Alex cut off several chunks of the creature's right foreleg and hung them close to the fire on some sticks.\nWhile the meat was being cooked, Alex scrapped the remaining blood and meat off his pelt.\n'I think the difference between a hide and actual leather is drying, right?' Alex thought.\nAlex scratched the back of his neck, uncertain if that was true.\nIn the end, he made some small holes in the hide and hung it close by the fire with several branches.\nIt took nearly an hour, and a lot of branches broke, but Alex managed it in the end.\nAlex checked on the meat and rotated it.\n'That should still take about an hour.'\nFor a while, Alex only sat beside the fire, listening to its relaxing crackling.\n'I could try training my body,' Alex thought. 'However, I don't have anything to drink. I'm already quite thirsty, and training will dry me out even faster.'\nAlex scratched his chin for a bit.\nThen, he went to a tree and climbed up.\nWhen he reached the crown, Alex scanned the horizon.\n'It smells a bit like rain, and I see some dark clouds on the horizon.'\n'I don't think water will be an issue in like an hour or so.'\nAlex smirked as he quickly descended the tree.\n'Well, time to do some training!'",

      "content": "Chapter 13 - Training\nAlex descended the tree and mentally prepared himself for his first training session in this new world.\nThe God had told Alex that he should destroy his body as thoroughly as possible with training and then use meditation to enhance his body with Mana.\nNothing out of the ordinary would happen if someone told something like this to a newbie regarding sports.\nWhy?\nBecause if someone didn't have enough experience in physical exercise, their willpower and resistance to physical pain wouldn't be strong enough to really damage their muscles.\nWhen a newbie regarding sports trained until they couldn't anymore, their muscles wouldn't receive too much damage since the body's self-preservation instinct kicked in. The person would feel like they couldn't continue, but someone that had trained themselves for longer could go further.\nAlex was a bit apprehensive about the God's words.\nAlex had trained his body to such a degree that he had even managed to join the biggest MMA organization in the world.\nIt wouldn't be an overstatement to say that Alex had once had a body that was normally only seen on TV, and, well, it made sense. After all, Alex's fights had also been broadcast on TV.\nBecause of that, if Alex decided to go all-out with his training, he had the willpower to actually train his body until even his tendons snapped.\nOf course, he had never done something like that before since it was stupid beyond belief to do that.\n'But this world is different,' Alex thought as he scratched his chin. 'If the Mana in the atmosphere has some kind of healing and strengthening effect on even tendons, training until my tendons snap might actually have an even greater effect.'\nAlex looked at the forest with a conflicted expression.\n'Yet, what if Mana actually doesn't help in healing such injuries? What if it helps, but it takes several days for it to heal something like that? I would be helpless during that time.'\n'I mean, I could try it in a village where I'm safe, but here? Not sure.'\nAlex sighed.\n'I should start slowly. Let's first get an above-average workout in. Let's go until I would be wrecked with soreness for the next couple of days.'\nAlex mentally prepared himself for training, something he hadn't done in a long time.\nAlex felt himself become more energetic and powerful as his brain sent signals to his body to prepare itself for a stressful time.\nThen, Alex did something surprising.\nHe took off all his clothes.\n'I will be plenty warm when I train, and I don't want my clothes to reek of sweat.'\nAlex made several of his joints crack as he jumped up and down a bit.\n'Alright, let's go!'\nAnd thus, Alex's first training session began.\nHe took about ten minutes to warm up by running, jumping, falling to the ground, standing up, pulling himself up on branches, and doing lots of other things.\nAlex hadn't trained in a long time, but as soon as his training actually began, he felt like no time had passed since his last session.\n'Usually, I would only do some muscle groups, but today, I'm doing all of them!'\nAlex grabbed his sword and used it as a make-shift weight. After all, it was quite heavy.\nHe put it on his shoulders, stood on the tip of his toes, went back to standing normally, went back to the tip of his toes, and so on.\nThis trained the calves.\nThen, he did squats with the sword.\nThis trained the thighs.\nAlex was experienced enough to know what kind of movement would train what kind of muscles.\nSince this was an intense training session, Alex planned to make it a really long one.\nAbout one hour after Alex started training, the rain had arrived.\nAlex ignored the fire and the food. If the fire went out, it went out, and the meat could still be eaten when it was cold. It should be cooked by now anyway.\nHowever, Alex grabbed his bag and cleaned it.\nAfter that, he dug a small hole in the form of a bucket and put the bag inside it.\nHe had remembered that when his healing potions broke, they had made the back wet, but most of the liquid had still remained inside. This meant that the bag could hold water to some degree.\nAlex's clothes had been put at a relatively dry place on his tree.\nIt took an entire 90 minutes until Alex had finished training his legs, and he already felt quite a bit of soreness. This was the point where he would normally stop training his legs when he had been on earth.\nFor safety's sake, Alex also stopped training his legs at this point.\nHe had to check the usage of the Mana first.\nNext, Alex trained his arms and shoulders.\nAs Alex continued training, he felt some kind of primal feeling.\nHe hadn't been sure where that feeling had come from initially, but he quickly found out.\nHe was training in the wilderness, away from any kind of responsibility, family, public image, work, and so on.\nOnly the rain drenching his body and the rough wilderness surrounded him.\nHe had to do nothing but train.\nTraining was his only responsibility.\nNothing else mattered.\nThere was no job he had to go back to.\nThere was no money he had to worry about.\nHe didn't have to wake up and go to work.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ He just had to grow more powerful.\nIn Alex's mind, the training seemingly transformed from an exercise into some form of spiritual cultivation.\nAlex felt like this was the most primal and most fundamental truth of the world.\nJust power, nothing else.\nAfter 90 minutes, Alex was done with his arms and shoulders.\nLastly, Alex focused on his abdomen, chest, and back.\nThis took 60 minutes.\nThen, Alex was finally done.\nHe had trained for four full hours, and he felt as alive as never before. These new surroundings had given Alex an incredible boost in energy, and training under the rain had been a bit weird at the beginning, but Alex had grown to love training in the rain.\nIt kept him cool, and the sensations of the raindrops had been almost hypnotic.\nAlex took one more deep breath as he slowly cooled down from his training.\nA couple minutes later, Alex realized that his mind wasn't as focused anymore.\nHe hadn't eaten much since yesterday, and he was severely dehydrated.\nAlex checked on the bag and saw that it was full of water.\nSadly, the water wasn't pure at all. It had a brownish tint to it.\n'I can't be choosy now.'\nAlex drank the brownish water. It definitely wasn't tasting good, but the cool sensation of the water running down his dry throat was great, nonetheless.\nThen, Alex went over to the fireplace.\nThe fire had long been extinguished, and the meat was dripping with water from the rain.\nHowever, Alex still grabbed the meat and consumed it.\nIt was missing a lot of seasoning, and it wasn't cooked well, but eating it like this awakened a special, primal feeling in Alex.\nSurprisingly, the meat tasted rather good!\nIt was quite tough, but it had a really strong taste, similar to game.\nAlex could have finished all of it, but he stopped himself.\nIt was important to not overfeed himself, or his concentration would wane while meditating.\nAfter Alex was finished eating and drinking some more, he sat down near his tree and put the sword beside him.\nThen, he closed his eyes and concentrated on the surroundings.\nSurprisingly, the sound of the rain wasn't distracting. In actuality, it was helping Alex in getting in tune with his surroundings.\nAfter some minutes passed, Alex felt a kind of mysterious force in the air, and he was sure that he had never felt anything like this on earth.\nThis was new.\nThis had to be Mana!\nAlex concentrated on the Mana and tried to pull at it with his mind.\nIt took some getting used to, but after around half an hour, Alex had become quite good at pulling the Mana into himself.\nAlex imagined himself as a black hole that pulled everything in its surroundings into itself.\nHe had to absorb everything that touched him.\nThe earth, wood, air, and other forms of matter didn't move, obviously, but since Alex's mind was able to manipulate the Mana to some degree, the Mana flowed into Alex's body.\nAs soon as the force entered Alex's body, he felt his muscles become warm but not hot.\nIt felt nice and relaxing.\nIt was like Alex was taking a bath.\nLike this, three more hours passed.\nThe sun went over the horizon, and by now, night had arrived.\nAlex opened his eyes.\nHe had to be careful now.",

      "content": "Chapter 14 - Power!\nAlex slowly stood up, and as soon as he did, his eyes widened.\nAlex looked down at his body with wonder.\n'My muscles, they feel fine!' Alex thought with shock.\nAlex moved his body around and did some light, basic exercises to test his body.\nSure enough, he felt completely fine!\nIt was like he hadn't just trained for four hours!\nAs Alex looked at his body with shock, the realization that this world was nothing like this previous one really set in for the first time.\nAlex had done enough sports on earth to know exactly how he should be feeling right now.\nYet, not even the slightest feeling of weakness was present.\n'The feeling of weakness while doing the workout comes from the built-up lactic acid, but after such a long resting period, the lactic acid has already vanished. The feeling of weakness after that comes from the small, torn muscle fibers.'\n'So, since this feeling isn't present, does it mean that my muscle fibers have already healed?' Alex thought with surprise.\n'Have I already gone through the recovery phase?!'\nAlex tried to comprehend his current situation.\nHe was even more shocked by this revelation than when he had seen the giant hedgehog.\nWhy?\nBecause Alex knew exactly how insane this was.\nAlex remembered a gaming term from his past life.\nThis was broken!\n'So, I can literally give my entire body several workouts each day?'\nHowever, Alex's feeling of shock and exhilaration quickly vanished.\nWhy?\nBecause Alex's mind was going to a dangerous place.\n'Theoretically, the more damaged the muscle, the stronger it will become. The problem on earth is that the recovery period for such damage would be so long that it wouldn't be nearly as efficient as training normally.'\n'But here?'\n'I'm not even sure if the power increase comes from the workout or the absorbed Mana. It could be that I only need to damage my muscles to make them absorb more Mana. I might not need to do actual, traditional training.'\nAlex's eyes focused on his left arm, and he felt a complex mix of feelings.\nAnticipation, nervousness, fear, curiosity, greed.\nWas Alex a normal human?\nWhen living in a normal environment, sure, he could be called normal.\nHowever, if he would remain normal while being flung into a new world, the God wouldn't have chosen him to enter his world.\nAfter all, that would have been boring.\nThe entire reason why Alex was supposed to grow powerful in a non-traditional way was entertainment.\nThe God wanted to be entertained.\nSo, obviously, the God wouldn't have chosen a boring person.\nAlex glanced at his left arm several times with a complex expression.\nHis heart rate increased as he became more nervous.\n'I need to try it!' Alex thought with gritted teeth.\nWith that, the decision had been made.\nAlex would damage the muscles in his left arm to such a degree that it would be considered an injury on earth.\n'This is going to hurt like hell!' Alex thought with narrowed eyes.\nSplash!\nAlex left his tree and let himself fall onto the wet floor.\nThen, he just stayed there for half a minute, motionless.\nAfter half a minute, he turned to a different spot.\nThis weird procedure continued for nearly half an hour.\nHalf an hour later, Alex felt incredibly cold.\nHis teeth were chattering as the sensations of his body became numb.\nAlex slowly turned over.\nAnd then, he violently pushed with his left arm using all his strength!\nAlex had decided to lower the temperature of his body and go all out without warming up.\nHe would train his left arm with all his power immediately!\nNo sane person would do this on earth.\nWhy?\nBecause it was way harder for muscles to stay flexible while they were cold. If the muscle fibers weren't flexible, they would tear way quicker and in greater quantity.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ It didn't even take a full minute for Alex's \"technique\" to show results.\nA burning sting of pain shot through Alex's left biceps as it violently cramped up.\nHowever, Alex was used to cramps, and he managed to continue pushing his left arm far past its limits.\nJust a minute later, Alex had to stop as he held his left arm in severe pain.\nHe had probably torn a huge part of his left biceps.\nYet, Alex wasn't done.\nA mad glint appeared in Alex's eyes as he wanted to go even further.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nAlex balled his right hand into a fist and violently beat up his left biceps.\nTen seconds later, Alex stopped as he only gasped for air.\nAlex knew exactly how long something like this would take to heal on earth.\n'Something like this would probably take four to six weeks to heal on earth. I hope it doesn't take that long to heal here because the pain is driving me crazy!'\nAlex held his left biceps as he walked over to his tree.\nThen, he sat down and tried to meditate.\nIt was far harder to enter meditation since he was in severe pain, but after an hour, he managed to connect with the Mana again.\nAlex felt his left biceps cool down from the hot pain, and the pain also slowly receded into the background. However, the pain was still there.\nAlex concentrated on the Mana in the air until he no longer felt the warm sensation on his left biceps.\nThen, he opened his eyes and moved his left arm.\nAs Alex saw the result, another complex mix of emotions appeared in his mind.\nDisbelief, exhilaration, fear.\nWhy disbelief?\nBecause his biceps had fully healed!\nWhy exhilaration?\nBecause this meant that Alex could gain power at a terrifying rate!\nWhy fear?\nBecause this meant that Alex had to go through an insane amount of pain!\nAlex knew exactly what this meant.\nTraining would transform from an enjoyable exercise into pure torture.\nThere would be no more fun in training.\nTraining would be full of pain, nothing else.\nAlex knew that he could still continue training normally. Like this, he would still enjoy the process while growing more powerful.\nYet, Alex also knew that this choice wasn't really a choice.\nNow that Alex had been in this world for over a day, an urge had appeared inside of him.\nAlex had seen several creatures that could kill him easily.\nAlex didn't want to die.\nAdditionally, the God had said that Alex could reach insane amounts of power.\nOn earth, physical power was useful for staying healthy and earning money.\nBut here, everything revolved around it.\nIntelligence wasn't the most important thing.\nConnections weren't the most important thing.\nMoney wasn't the most important thing.\nInfluence wasn't the most important thing.\nPower was!\nAlex had seen the God's power when he had summoned the previous Mage Emperor and when he had changed the very reality in his hall.\nIt didn't matter how many people attacked him.\nIt didn't matter what weapons everyone used.\nIn front of this God, all of these things became useless.\nAlex knew that there was a possibility that he could become just as powerful as the God.\nWhat would that mean?\nFreedom!\nPower!\nEverything that he wanted!\nNothing in the entire world would be able to stop him!\nHe could do whatever he wanted without any repercussions and without any worries!\nToday, Alex had truly awakened his undying thirst for power.\nHe had to become powerful!\nNothing was more important than power!\nNothing!\nAfter steeling his resolve, Alex climbed up his tree.\nAfter he reached a height of a couple of meters, Alex gritted his teeth.\nThen, he jumped down.\nAs long as his bones didn't break, everything would be fine!\nBANG!",

      "content": "Chapter 15 - Small Expedition\nIt has been three days since Alex had started training his body, and he had made quite a lot of progress.\nThe masochistic training had been hard to handle in the beginning, but Alex slowly got used to it after literally jumping over his shadow multiple times.\nAfter the first couple of jumps, Alex didn't want to feel any more pain.\nIt was just too much.\nHowever, after he saw a visible improvement in his strength, he forced himself to continue.\nThe taste of power was just too enticing.\nHowever, on this day, he would have to abort his training.\nAlex had run out of water, and the beast he had killed had started to get infested by insects. Due to the cold climate, the meat was still edible, but the insects inside the corpse were simply too disgusting.\nOn top of that, the smell of the beast was slowly vanishing, and Alex had already seen a deer coming into his visual range before it fled after seeing him.\nThree days ago, no animals had appeared close to this place.\nThis meant that Alex was no longer safe.\nThunk! Thunk!\nAlex jumped to the tree and shot himself upward again with his legs, grabbing the lowest branch.\nThree days ago, Alex wouldn't have been able to do something like this.\nThe growth of his physical power was terrifying!\nRight now, Alex's body was even more powerful than his old body had been at its peak.\nMana made a huge difference in the speed of Alex's improvement.\nAlex quickly climbed the tree and looked around. There were so many animals in this forest, so there had to be some kind of water source.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ However, due to the trees, Alex couldn't see the ground from up here, making it difficult to spot any water source.\nAlex could only check for spots with fewer trees.\nAlex found a couple of them and decided to investigate.\nAt the same time, Alex would also search for more food.\nBANG!\nAlex climbed down from the tree and jumped the last bit, not receiving an injury.\n'Well, I guess it's time to investigate,' Alex thought with a frown.\nThis would be the first time he would truly leave this place, and he didn't know what would wait for him.\nHe only hoped that similarly powerful creatures like that monster he had killed by luck were rare.\nOtherwise, he might die.\nAlex grabbed his dirty clothes, his backpack, and his sword.\nLastly, he put a gigantic, black coat around his body, hiding his sword.\nThis coat was made of the creature's fur, and it had been dried multiple times by now. The coat was basically made of the entire hide of the creature, making it rather sizable.\nAlex grabbed some grass from the ground and put it through some holes at the edge of the coat, creating a seam.\nAfter doing that a couple of times, the coat completely enveloped Alex's body, keeping him warm. Additionally, the coat did quite a good job at hiding his sword.\nAt the front, the coat was a bit shorter to allow Alex to sprint without getting in the way.\nAlex tied his sword to his back with some makeshift rope made out of grass, hiding it behind his back and coat.\nSadly, Alex wasn't good enough at sewing to create a permanent holding for his sword. If Alex wanted to use his sword, he would need to cut through the entire rope, which would require him to make a new one after that.\nAlex also put the holder of his backpack around his torso, making it rest to the left side of his thigh. Luckily the strap was long enough.\nAlex had put the bag to his left because, when he grabbed his sword, he would swing it to the right. The bag would only be in the way if it were on the right.\nIn the end, Alex stood there, completely cloaked in black.\nHis unkempt and dirty black hair seemed to perfectly fit the coat he was wearing, making him appear like a mysterious wild man.\nIf one saw him like this, one wouldn't think that he was technically still a minor.\nThen, Alex quickly stepped forward into the forest, his hands empty.\nWhy didn't Alex carry his sword in his hands?\nTwo reasons.\nFirst of all, he wanted to hide it. Animals weren't stupid. If they saw a long, black object in his hand, they would become wary of it.\nSecond of all, if anyone attacked him from behind, his sword would be between them. However, since the sword was hidden, the attacker wouldn't know.\nIf Alex got attacked from behind, the attacker might die very quickly since the sword would already be between their teeth.\nAt that point, Alex would only need to move his sword in the attacker's mouth.\nAlex's sword was terrifyingly sharp, and he wouldn't need to use much power to kill his attacker.\nAlex had thought of everything while suiting up.\nHe had to be careful in this forest.\nAlex jogged out of his area with quite some speed.\nWhy?\nBecause, if he walked slowly, an ambusher would have more time to plan their ambush. Sure, Alex might be able to get by without being noticed if he walked slower, but an ambush would be that more devastating.\nAlex didn't bet on not being ambushed.\nAlex didn't see any other animals after silently jogging for nearly ten minutes.\nHowever, he found some food.\nChestnuts!\nAlex quickly stopped as he saw the chestnut tree and climbed it.\nFor the next 30 minutes, Alex gathered chestnuts and ate a ton of them.\n'Hope that's not the poisonous kind,' Alex thought as he crunched down.\nIt definitely didn't taste good.\nHowever, they, at least, tasted edible as far as he could tell.\n'Well, worst-case scenario, I just get a case of the runs,' he thought.\nGrunt, Grunt!\nAlex heard some grunting and looked at the origin of the sound.\nSome meters away from the tree was a sizable hog.\nIt wasn't as big as the other one Alex saw, but it was still quite a bit heavier than a wolf.\nWhen Alex saw the hog, his eyes narrowed.\n'I didn't attack the last hog since I didn't have a good weapon, but things have changed now!' he thought.\nThe hog was eyeing the tree warily.\nIt had seen and heard Alex since he hadn't been very stealthy.\nHowever, it didn't leave.\nThis was its chestnut tree, and it had munched on the chestnuts quite a bit.\nAlex looked quite a bit bigger than he actually was, thanks to his black coat, which intimidated the hog a bit.\nSeeing a big black creature in a tree was quite terrifying.\nThe black creature, Alex, slowly and silently moved around the branches on the tree with practiced ease, vanishing as he moved upwards.\nCrack, crack!\nA lot of the chestnuts got shaken off by his movement, dropping to the floor.\nThen, some branches behind the chestnut tree moved.\nAfter that, some more rustling could be heard, but even further away.\nHad the creature left?\nThe hog was uncertain.\nAfter some minutes of hesitating, the hog moved around the tree from a distance, trying to find the black creature.\nAfter several minutes of searching for the creature, the hog quickly took one of the chestnuts and retreated again.\nIt quickly ate the chestnut and looked at its surroundings.\nThis process repeated a couple of times until the hog was finally no longer nervous.\nThe creature had left.\nSsshh!\nSome silent rustling was heard from the tree above the hog, and it looked upward.\nAlex was falling down, his sword in both of his hands. His right hand held the handle while his left hand held the edge of the sword.\nAlex already knew that his sword couldn't injure himself for some reason. This meant that he could grab the sword like a staff.\nAlex fell down on the hog's neck like a guillotine.\nBANG!\nThe sword was so insanely sharp that it cut through the entire neck of the fat hog with ease, creating the sound of an explosion as it hit the ground below the hog.\nThe hog had died in an instant.\nAlex was sprayed with blood as his abdomen hit the severed head of the hog.\nAlex grimaced in disgust as he saw all the blood.\n'I either need to wash this off, or I'm going to get crusty and stinky quite quickly,' he thought.\nThe image of a decapitated pig sent some shivers down Alex's spine, but he knew that he had to get used to something like this.\nHe would have to kill way more animals in the near future, and he might even need to kill humans when he rejoined their society.\nAlex wasn't so naïve that he believed that a human society based on power would be a kind place.\nAlex looked at his kill for quite some time, just trying to take the scene in.\nThe decapitated body of the pig bled like crazy, and it was still twitching.\nMeanwhile, the empty eyes of the decapitated pig-head seemingly looked at Alex, asking him why he had killed it.\nAlex took a deep breath, instantly being assaulted by the rancid stench of fresh pig blood.\nHowever, Alex gnashed his teeth.\n'The issue of food and water has been solved for now,' Alex thought as he looked at the corpse.\n'My sword is quite sharp, which should allow me to carve some tools out of wood, stuff like buckets and bowls.'\n'For now, I could drink distilled water made out of pig blood. It will be a bit disgusting and not super healthy, but that's not high up on my list of priorities.'\n'Let's get a fire going!'",

      "content": "Chapter 16 - Fruit\nCrackle.\nA fire was burning as several pieces of meat hung around it.\nIn the middle above the fire hung a bucket.\nAlex had felled an entire tree with his sword and had hollowed out a big part of its trunk, creating his bucket.\nThen, Alex had felled an even bigger tree, creating two round bowls.\nThe sharpness of Alex's sword was what allowed him to achieve this feat.\nAlex had filled the bucket with pig blood and hung it above the fire.\nAlex put one of the bowls over the bucket and put a long branch on it, which led to the side.\nThe bowl would catch the evaporating water, and when enough water gathered, it would trickle down to the lowest edge of the bowl, where the branch was.\nThe branch led the trickling water to the side, to a different bowl.\nThis was how Alex would solve the issue of water.\nSadly, this would be distilled water, and he also couldn't wash his tools since he didn't have any water to begin with.\nThe water in the other bucket didn't look refreshing or delicious, but it was water.\nStrewn around the clearing were the remaining parts of the hog.\nAlex couldn't finish the entire thing on his own, even if he ate for several days, and the meat would go bad anyway.\nSo, Alex decided to cut the pig apart and scattered the pieces around the clearing.\nWhy?\nTo ward off predators.\nSure, the smell of blood would gather many of them, but predators were also just animals.\nIf they could get food for free, they wouldn't want to fight.\nIf a predator came to the clearing, they would see a black creature of unknown size, thanks to the coat, sitting beside a hot fire.\nEvery normal predator would grab one of the pieces of the hog and would run away, leaving Alex alone.\nWhile Alex's food and water were being prepared, Alex decided to get some more training in.\nAlex put his coat away and climbed the tree.\nBOOM!\nAs Alex hit the ground, a loud slam echoed throughout the forest.\nThis sound would also deter any animal from coming to this spot.\nAfter all, only something big and powerful could make such loud sounds.\nAfter three jumps, Alex heard some rustling.\nHis entire body hurt, but all of the pain was forgotten as he realized something else was close.\nIn the light of the fire, Alex could see two eyes in the dark.\nThey weren't very high up, and the animal was looking at Alex warily.\nHowever, it didn't look at Alex with fear.\nIt was more like an evaluating expression.\nAlex looked back.\nAfter a bit, Alex could see the owner of the eyes.\nIt was the green lizard that had killed two of the four wolves.\nAfter a bit, the lizard bit down on one of the pieces of meat and fled.\nWhen Alex saw the lizard retreating, he amended his plans.\nAlex grabbed his coat and put it around himself before he continued training.\nWhy?\nBecause the lizard had the ability to shoot fireballs. If one beast could shoot fireballs, it was possible that other beasts could do the same. However, the coat of the creature should offer some protection. Even if it caught fire, Alex could always ditch it.\nAlex's masochistic training continued, and after a couple of jumps, Alex concentrated on healing himself with Mana.\nAlex always looked forward to this part of his training since this was the part that increased his power.\nOn top of that, it wasn't as painful as the other part.\nThunk! Thunk!\nAlex heard rhythmic, loud sounds.\nAlex looked in the direction of the sounds but couldn't see anything.\nThey came from too far away.\n'What's making that sound?' Alex thought.\nThunk! Thunk!\nThe sounds continued, and Alex only looked in that direction.\nSpring! Spring!\nThe sound of something elastic being stretched and snapping back into place could also be heard.\nEeeeeh! Creak! Creak! Snap! Snap!\nThe sounds of bending and cracking wood joined in the cacophony of sounds, and the sounds were getting louder.\nAlex's eyes widened.\nSomething big was coming!\nAlex immediately abandoned everything and climbed the closest tree.\nWhen he found a good spot, he stopped moving and grew silent.\nThe sounds continued and grew even louder.\nSnap!\nEventually, Alex saw what created these weird sounds, and his eyes widened.\nIt was an absolutely humongous beast!\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ It was probably four meters high, excluding its needles.\nNeedles?\nYes, this was the green hedgehog Alex had seen when he had arrived in this world!\nThe loud thumping sounds were its footsteps.\nThe creaking sounds of wood were its flexible needles getting hung up on the trees.\nThe snapping sounds were its flexible needles jumping back into place after passing a tree.\nThe forest and trees seemingly moved with the hedgehog as it bent all of the trees while passing.\nIt was moving slowly and in a relaxed manner towards the place Alex had stayed.\nThen, it slowly bent down as it consumed a huge part of the hog!\n'I totally forgot! Even though hedgehogs are cute, they are also technically omnivores. They eat a ton of insects! A hedgehog of that size obviously also eats meat!' Alex thought as he remained completely silent.\nThis monster was far above his ability!\nThe creature Alex had killed by luck was nothing in comparison to this hedgehog!\nAs the hedgehog came closer, it ate all the pieces of the pig, including the ones that were being cooked.\nAfter it reached the fire, it stopped above it.\nAlex was confused for a second, but he realized what the hedgehog was doing.\nIt was warming its belly!\nThe sizzling fire directly below its belly didn't even bother the hedgehog!\nThis was an absolute monster!\nAlex kept his breath as he watched the hedgehog warm itself.\nThunk!\nApparently, the fire wasn't warm enough, so it lowered its belly and lied down.\nSadly, this suffocated the fire.\nAfter some seconds, the hedgehog stood up again, displeased.\nIt scratched the fire with his hind leg in displeasure but continued eating.\n'Well, there goes food,' Alex thought.\nAfter the hedgehog was done, it turned its head slowly.\nAnd it directly looked into Alex's eyes.\nAlex's entire body shivered as he realized that the hedgehog had known where he was the entire time!\nOtherwise, its gaze wouldn't have homed in on him with such accuracy!\nAlex didn't dare to move.\nCreak! Creak! Creak!\nThe humongous body of the hedgehog slowly shook as its needles swayed back and forth.\nPlonk! Plonk! Plonk!\nSome things fell off the hedgehog's needles.\nAlex still didn't dare to move!\nAfter the hedgehog shook itself a little bit, it continued walking.\nAfter the hedgehog was a couple meters away, Alex jumped down from the tree and looked at his campsite.\nThe hedgehog already knew that he was there, so it made no sense to keep hiding.\nEverything was destroyed.\nAll the meat was gone, the fire was out, and the water was spilled.\nNothing had been spared.\nAlex had to sigh when he saw that.\nHowever, Alex's eyes spied something new in the clearing.\nIt was a round object, but Alex couldn't see it clearly in the dark.\nAlex walked closer and inspected it.\n'Is that a fruit?' Alex thought with surprise. 'Where did that come from?'\nAlex remembered how the hedgehog had shaken itself and that he had heard several sounds of things falling to the ground.\n'Did these things come from the hedgehog's needles? Since when do hedgehogs grow fruit?!' Alex thought.\nAlex looked at the hedgehog in the distance, and sure enough, after looking closer, Alex saw some round objects on the hedgehog's needles. They shone a bit under the moonlight.\nAlex remembered how the hedgehog had eaten everything, had looked at him, and had then shaken its body.\n'Is this a kind of trade?' Alex thought with surprise. 'Is it familiar with humans? Could it be possible that it gives humans fruits in exchange for meat? I mean, the hedgehog is big and cumbersome. Everything probably flees from it, making it surprisingly hard for it to hunt.'\nAlex gathered the fruits, but before he got to the last one, something happened.\nHSSSSSSS!\nThe loud sound of hissing came from Alex's front, and he jumped back out of reflex.\nSnap!\nThe animal quickly grabbed the fruit, turned around, and fled into the distance.\nIt was that lizard again!\nIt had intimidated Alex and took that opportunity to run with one of the fruits!\nHowever, Alex's eyebrows furrowed as he scratched his chin in thought.\n'It could have launched a fireball at me, but it didn't. Instead, it hissed at me, grabbed the fruit, and ran. It's probably wary of my power, but the fruit was enticing enough for it to take the risk,' Alex thought.\nAlex looked at the fruits with more interest.\n'Anything coming from such a fearsome beast couldn't be simple! It's a risk, but I think it's worth trying to eat the fruits!'\nAlex climbed a tree and ate one of the fruits.\nAs soon as he swallowed the first bite, something happened.\nA burning pain shot throughout Alex's body!",

      "content": "Chapter 17 - Going Further\nAlex's entire body seemingly started burning, but this was only an illusion created by the fruit.\nAs soon as Alex swallowed the first bite, he felt like his muscles started to catch on fire.\nYet, for some reason, this sensation wasn't exactly painful. It had some painful aspects to it, but a certain feeling of excitement, restlessness, and energy came with it.\nAlex had never tried steroids in his past life since that would ruin his career, but he imagined that steroids felt similar, minus the slight pain.\nAfter some seconds, Alex noticed something.\n'This feels very similar to absorbing Mana, just way more intense,' he thought with excitement.\nDue to the intensity of the experience, Alex also noticed something else.\nAlex looked at his body and touched his head.\n'I haven't noticed it before since the Mana always felt gentle, but my head actually doesn't feel any of the Mana. My entire body feels like it's heating up, but my head remains cool. It's almost like my head isn't affected by the Mana.'\nAlex frowned.\n'The God told me that I would be unable to practice magic. Is that what he meant?'\n'Logically, Mages should get their abilities to cast spells by increasing the power of their soul and mind. At least, that's how it always worked in RPGs. I guess it works similarly here. After all, these kinds of people are called Mages, and they harness the power of the environment to create powerful attacks.'\n'The God said that Mana is the main reason how people could become so powerful in his world, which means that all the power of people hinges on the usage of Mana. There should be something in my body that allows me to absorb and control Mana.'\n'I guess Mages probably absorb the Mana with their souls and minds, leaving their bodies weak. There has to be some drawback to an advantage. Otherwise, it wouldn't be entertaining. I mean, wasn't this the entire reason why the God made his world like this and why I'm here?'\n'So, in essence, Mages probably don't absorb Mana with their bodies, but with their mind. If a Mage ate this fruit, they would probably feel this sensation only in their head, while I feel it across my body.'\n'The thing that stores and distributes the Mana across my body probably has no connection to my head, making it impossible for Mana to reach it. That's probably also why all the Mana gets dumped into my body since it has nowhere else to go.'\n'What am I doing?!' Alex thought as he gritted his teeth. 'I'm currently filled to the brim with Mana, but I'm thinking about such stuff that's so far in the future?! Get a grip, Al- argh, Shang!'\nAlex immediately shot up and climbed higher on the tree.\nThen, he jumped with all his power and readied himself for a huge impact.\nBANG!\nAlex felt pain shoot throughout his arms and knees as he hit the ground.\nThen, he quickly stood up and ran to the tree again.\nAs Alex climbed up the tree again, he noticed something else, which made him narrow his eyes with a gleam.\n'My legs and arms don't hurt anymore! This means that I don't need to rest!'\n'I have to use this opportunity!'\nAlex climbed higher than usual and looked down.\nIt was so high!\nHowever, the burning sensation pushed him over the edge, and he jumped.\nAlex never had had a good opportunity to see if the Mana's regenerating properties also worked on his bones. Logically, it should, but Alex wasn't sure of the extent.\nAlex felt like time stopped as he fell towards the ground.\nCRACK!\nAnd Alex got his wish.\nAlex didn't want to experiment with his legs since they were more important than his arms.\nBecause of that, Alex had initially landed on his feet but had then fallen forward to transmit the force of the fall onto his right arm.\nAlex's right forearm broke apart.\nAlex gritted his teeth violently as an incredible pain shot throughout his arm.\nBreaking a bone was never easy.\nAlex touched his right forearm with his left hand and felt the bone sticking out.\n'Great, an open fracture,' he thought.\nAlex quickly felt a change in his body.\nThe hot sensation seemingly got weaker all over his body and focused on his right forearm.\nCRK! CRK!\nCreaking sounds could be heard as the bone in Alex's right forearm seemingly moved back into place.\nSplotch!\nThe sound of moving flesh and blood had a unique feeling to it, but Alex only focused on his arm.\nThe bone had been buried back into his arm, and the broken skin and flesh above it started to heal with speed visible to the naked eye.\nTwo minutes later, the hot sensation completely left Alex's body.\nAlex touched his right arm and felt a stinging pain.\n'Not fully healed yet, but all the Mana has been used up,' he thought. 'Apparently, Mana also accelerates the recovery of my bones, but the Mana required is incomparable. According to the intensity of the sensation, this one bite of the fruit probably gave me more Mana than I could get in several hours of meditation. The same amount of Mana could have healed my entire body twice.'\nAlex looked at his right arm with shining eyes.\n'However, if Mana can strengthen my muscles, it can probably also strengthen my bones,' he concluded.\n'If my strength ever reaches a level that just using my muscles would break my own bones, it would be truly tragic. I can't make such a stupid mistake.'\nAlex gritted his teeth.\n'My training is about to become even more painful. I fucking hate that! Why does training have to be so fucking painful?!'\nAlex ran to the tree and grabbed the fruit.\nAlex had been careful with his first bite, which was why the bite had been relatively small.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ There was still a ton left.\nAlex took a big bite and climbed the tree.\nAn even more powerful sensation engulfed his body as he jumped down again.\nCRACK!\nMore broken bones, but this time, Alex had enough Mana inside his body to heal everything.\nIt only took half a minute for everything to heal again.\nCRACK!\nThe process repeated itself, and Alex took another bite of the fruit.\nCRACK!\nCRACK!\nCRACK!\nAbout 15 minutes later, the fruit was completely used up, and Alex grabbed the next one.\nHowever, he hesitated as he gritted his teeth.\nHe wished that he had never come up with that terrifying thought.\nWhat thought?\nWell, what if he got more powerful and got punched in the gut?\nWould his organs be able to resist the force?\nLogically, no, but there had to be a way to fix such a glaring issue. After all, the God had said that there had been innumerable paths to power in the past. He refused to believe that they were all weak to body blows.\n'I can't stop now!'\nCrunch! Crunch!\nAlex ate the entire fruit at once, and he felt like his body was about to explode.\nThere was so much Mana!\nIt was no longer a gentle situation.\nNo, Alex felt like his body was literally being incinerated!\nAlex climbed up but hesitated.\nThis was very different from all his previous jumps.\nIf he misjudged this jump, he would actually die.\nHowever, Alex had already burned the bridge.\nThere was no way back.\nIf he didn't manage to find an outlet for all this Mana, he would probably die.\nSo, Alex jumped forward and protected his head with his arms.\nThen, he hit the ground.\nChest and abdomen first.\nMeanwhile, the God was watching Alex with a mad grin.\nYes, that was exactly why he had chosen him!\nThis kind of insanity was why he had chosen Shang!",

      "content": "Chapter 18 - Payoff\nAlex felt an impact.\nIt was like he had been hit by a speeding car.\nAlex couldn't even discern all the different sounds that reverberated throughout his body.\nHe heard and felt several cracking noises, quickly followed by the sounds of rupturing flesh.\nAlex couldn't breathe!\n\"Urgh- Hurgh!\"\nAlex puked and coughed violently as he spat blood out of his mouth.\n'I can't breathe!'\nAlex coughed violently as more and more blood came out of his body.\nIt felt like there was water in his lungs, and he desperately wanted to get some air, but only a disgusting gurgling sound came out of his mouth.\nCRK! CRK!\nAlex turned over to his side as he curled up like a shrimp. The sounds of cracking bone rang throughout his body as they quickly snapped back to their original place.\n30 seconds of absolute agony and panic passed.\n\"Hurgh!\"\nAlex puked up a huge mass of blood, and he took a deep breath.\nThe panic slowly subsided as Alex gulped in a ton of air.\nThen, he simply sat down.\nThis was way worse than he had imagined!\nHow was anyone supposed to do that multiple times?!\nAlex only lay on the ground, trying to hold back his tears.\nThis was torture!\nHowever, the burning of the Mana intensified again.\nAlex had eaten an entire fruit, and one jump wasn't enough.\nAlex's mind fell into disarray as he couldn't make a decision.\n\"I don't want to anymore!\" he shouted to himself.\nHowever, as he felt the Mana become even more intense, he stood up and climbed the tree again with shaking and fidgety limbs.\nAlex didn't want to, but he jumped again.\nThis time, he landed on his back.\nCRACK!\nAlex had protected his head, but his spine broke apart.\nAnother 30 breathless seconds of panic and pain passed.\nAlex's body shook as he lay on the ground.\nHe didn't want to anymore!\nIt was so painful!\nAlex wished that he was back on earth, but that wish couldn't come true.\nHe didn't want to do this!\nHowever, the burning sensation of the Mana intensified again as his body fully regenerated.\nAlex slowly sat up as he slowly walked over to the tree.\nHe had to hold back his tears.\nHowever, he climbed up the tree again, this time, higher than before.\nIt was time for his legs.\nAlex climbed all the way to the top.\nHis entire body shook, but he jumped.\nAlex fell for several seconds.\nCRACK!\nAlex's legs shattered as his kneecaps shot out of his body, one of them hitting a tree and another one sliding on the ground.\nSome of the bones in Alex's torso also broke, but he managed to barely stay alive.\nThis time, it was easier since his lungs hadn't been damaged too much.\nThe worst thing had always been the inability to breathe.\nThe inability to breathe brought a sense of existential dread to him. This dread was far worse than the pain.\nThis time, the intensity of the Mana didn't increase again.\nHe had used up enough Mana.\nFor a while, Alex only lied on the ground, not moving.\nHe didn't think about anything.\nHe only lied there and paused.\nSeveral minutes passed, and the sensations Alex had felt in the past half an hour shot through his mind.\nIt was like he was trying to come to terms with what he had just felt.\nIt was so very different from his life on earth.\nSure, he had gone through tough training on earth, but this wasn't training.\nThis was torture.\nSilence.\nFor a while, Alex only listened to the silence of the forest.\n'Why am I doing this to myself?'\nSilence.\n'Is this really the best way?'\nSilence.\n'I don't know.'\nAlex looked over to the tree.\n'Two fruits are left.'\nSilence.\n'Should I?'\nSilence.\nSwish!\nAlex's eyes suddenly snapped open as he heard the sound of moving foliage.\nCRSH!\nAlex gritted his teeth violently as blood exploded out of his arm.\nA panther!\nAlex had utterly forgotten that he wasn't in some safe location.\nHe was in a forest filled with violent animals and creatures!\nAlex had lied on his back, and the panther had wanted to bite his neck.\nLuckily, Alex had barely managed to block the bite with his left arm.\nThe panther bit down on Alex's forearm, destroying the muscles.\nYet, surprisingly, Alex's bone didn't break.\nThe panther was violently trying to scratch him with its claws, and several wounds appeared all over Alex's body as his hand went to his back.\nBut there was nothing on his back!\nAlex realized that he had taken off his sword when he had decided to land on his back.\n'Fuck!'\nThe panther let go of Alex's arm and jumped back.\nHowever, Alex grabbed the panther's neck with his right hand.\nWhoosh!\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The panther jumped back, but Alex was pulled along.\nJudging by the distance, the panther was stronger than the panthers on earth. After all, it had just jumped back two meters while pulling Alex with it.\nHowever, the panther wasn't the only thing stronger than the earth-variant.\nAlex had managed to keep hold of the panther's neck all this time with only one hand, which surprised him.\nHe was sure that he hadn't been able to do that a couple of days ago!\nThe panther tried to get rid of Alex and attacked him with its claws, but Alex's instincts kicked in.\nAlex immediately pulled himself closer and hugged the panther's neck with his arms and its torso with his legs.\nThe panther tried to get rid of Alex and cut him a couple more times, but Alex didn't let go.\nThe panther shouted aggressively, trying to get Alex away from him, but as Alex's legs tightened even more, its aggressive shout transformed into a whimper.\nAlex felt how his legs squished the panther's organs and muscles as its bones started to creak.\nAlex's eyes opened with surprise.\nBANG! CRACK!\nAlex pulled his right arm back and punched the panther's chest, which quickly caved in.\nThe panther stopped moving, and Alex quickly took hold of its head and neck.\nCRACK!\nAnd the panther was dead.\nAlex breathed in several times as the adrenaline slowly subsided.\nThen, he looked at his body.\n'Have I done that?' he thought in shock.\nThis panther was not small, and its power was no joke.\nYet, the panther hadn't been able to break Alex's bones, and Alex had broken its bones just by punching.\nThe difference in power was apparent!\nFor some time, Alex only looked at the panther with shock.\nSomething like this was only possible in a dream.\nHow could a human kill a big cat with bare hands and with such ease at that?\nAfter a while, Alex looked at his right hand as he clenched it into a fist.\nThen, his eyes narrowed.\n'It's not for nothing!'\n'My past few days of pain have shown that they are not for nothing!'\nAlex's gaze immediately went to the last two fruits.\nThen, he walked over with determination and ate another one.\nThe pain, panic, and torture were horrible, but the feeling of seeing his own power increase by so much had washed all of these things away.\nHe wanted more!",

      "content": "Chapter 19 - Progress\nA month had passed since Alex arrived in this world.\nFor the first couple of days, Alex focused on finding a steady water source and scouted for places with fruit, berries, and nuts. He didn't know if this world followed the rules of needing different vitamins and minerals to be healthy, but he didn't want to find out while being in the wild.\nAfter a couple of days, Alex found a river going through the valley's center, splitting the mountain range surrounding the valley in two. In the very center of the valley was a lake where the water gathered for a while before continuing down the river.\nAlex had found a humongous dead tree there and planned to create a home for himself.\nAlex had already used up all the fruits he had received from the hedgehog in a spree of self-destroying insanity. Luckily, he had gotten somewhat used to the torturous training, even if he still feared it.\nCourage didn't mean being fearless but being able to overcome one's fears. Alex still feared the time when he would gain another set of fruits, but he knew that he could jump over his shadow when it was time.\nThe taste of power was irresistible for Alex. Even if the training was horrible and inhumane, the power he gained from it was worth it in his mind.\nAlex used his desire for power as fuel to overcome his fear of pain.\nWas something like that healthy?\nThat depended on one's circumstances and viewpoints.\nWould such pain change a person?\nDefinitely.\nHowever, different people changed differently when undergoing such torture.\nHow would Alex change?\nThat remained to be seen.\nWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\nAlex stood in a clearing, constantly swinging his sword.\nAfter a brief run-in with another set of wolves, Alex had realized that he wasn't very good at using his sword. Alex had always only fought with his body for his entire life, never with a true weapon. This made him very unaccustomed to fighting with an actual weapon.\nFollowing that fight, Alex had decided to train with his sword more, and just shortly after training with his sword, Alex noticed something troublesome.\nHis triceps and back started to hurt quite quickly.\nAlex had trained his entire body, but training everything equally was not always the correct choice.\nA good example would be a climber. If someone had bulky legs, a bulky abdomen, and a bulky back, they would increase the strain on their hands and arms due to the added weight of muscles.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ In that case, training everything equally would not only not help but even be detrimental to performance.\nWhat about a swordfighter?\nBulkiness would increase the mass and volume of the body, slowing down the speed of the fighter. Even more, if the muscles on the torso reached a certain mass, they would even restrict the movement of the arms.\nOne only had to look at the videos of bulky men being unable to touch their backs.\nHowever, with all of that said, a certain amount of power was still necessary across the entire body. Every muscle would be required in a fight. They were just used with different intensity.\nBecause of all these reasons, Alex decided to mainly train with his sword. He would only give his entire body a workout after every third session of sword training.\nTraining with a sword was not any less strenuous than training one's entire body. It simply trained different muscle groups.\nAfter every session of training with the sword, Alex felt a huge part of his body burn with pain. On earth, someone would have long since stopped training since overtraining was just as bad as undertraining.\nBut here, there was no overtraining.\nAfter Alex was done with his training, he jumped up a nearby tree and sat down in meditation.\nAlex had been training like a madman, and it was showing incredible results.\nHe no longer needed to climb a tree. With one jump, he could easily jump two meters into the air, even with the heavy sword on his back.\nAlex had already broken the physical limit of humans on earth.\nThis was the effect of Mana.\nSome minutes later, Alex jumped down from the tree and walked to the edge of the clearing.\nIn front of Alex was a huge tree with a hole in the middle. The tree was nearly three-meters-wide, but it wasn't the tallest tree.\nAfter all, it was already dead, and the cold wind had destroyed the upper part of its trunk.\nBesides the hole in the tree were several pieces of wood arranged in the shape of a big doorframe.\nThis wasn't a doorframe but Alex's future hut. Every day, Alex would cut more wood and add to the wood. In a couple of days, he would have his very own, tiny hut.\nAlex used stone for nails, but it was a difficult process to get them into the wooden boards. After all, stone was hard but brittle. If he just hammered the nails in, they would break.\nBecause of that, Alex had to cut out the holes with his sword and carefully insert the stone.\nThis made the structure very unstable and wonky, but it held up for now. As long as nothing touched the structure, and as long as the wind wasn't too strong, the structure would hold.\nAlex went to a bench near the structure and grabbed his clothes.\nHis old clothes had long since been ripped to pieces, including his spare clothes.\nHis new clothes were made of wolf fur.\nOne would think that such clothing looked wild and powerful, but in reality, it looked poor and pitiful.\nHowever, this set of clothing was already far superior to the previous ones. After all, Alex had gotten better at sewing.\nWho would have thought that one of the essential skills of surviving in the cold wilds was sewing?\nIf Alex were in a tropical climate, he wouldn't have to bother that much with sewing. He would only need to remain in the shade most of the time, and if he walked around, he would only need to protect himself from the sun.\nA blanket wasn't nearly as hard to make as actual clothing.\nAfter putting on his clothes, Alex grabbed his cloak and put it around his shoulders.\nAlex performed a couple of jumps to test if his movement would be impaired by the new set of clothing and realized that it wouldn't.\nAlex looked at the dimming sky. He couldn't see the sun, but he wouldn't be able to see the sun anyway, even if it were midday.\nWhy?\nBecause the sky was covered in oppressive, cold, grey clouds.\nIt had already snowed a couple of days ago, and Alex noticed that the weather was getting colder.\nThe winter would soon be here.\nThis was a major problem for Alex since warmth would be of primary importance.\nHe even guessed that temperatures might even reach -20 to -40 degrees Celsius at the peak of winter.\nEven if Alex had an incredibly powerful body now, he knew that he couldn't survive such temperatures.\nThis was why Alex concentrated on becoming better at sewing and making a hut.\nHowever, there was one major problem standing in his way.\nDusk soon arrived, and Alex's eyes narrowed as he checked his equipment again.\nAlex touched his sword to comfort himself and released a sigh as he closed his eyes.\nSome seconds later, Alex opened his eyes with a determined look.\n'You've crept around my camp for long enough. Sleeping has become difficult with you around, and I'm sure that you will strike soon. My hut and clothing are in danger as long as you are around. If you destroy my hut, I might not find the time to create a new one in time.'\nAlex only considered his hut and clothing, completely ignoring his own physical safety.\nAlex slowly walked forward as darkness took hold of the forest.\nThere were no stars, no moon.\nThere were only dark clouds above Alex as all the light vanished in the forest.\nHowever, Alex was no longer a normal human.\nThe Mana had not only increased the power of Alex's body but also the sensitivity of his senses.\nAlex's five senses had become several times sharper, to the point that Alex could even see a couple of meters in front of him in this total darkness.\nAlex didn't know how the Mana had been able to increase the power of his eyes. After all, the Mana couldn't even reach his head for some reason.\nYet, it was undeniable that the sensitivity of his eyes had increased tremendously.\nAlex walked forward, away from the hut.\nHe didn't want to put his hut in danger.\nAs Alex walked forward in total darkness, he noticed some snowflakes falling from the clouds.\nAlex could still see the white on the snowflakes, even though there was basically no light in the forest anymore.\nHe only saw small, white crystals of snow slowly falling to the ground with a backdrop of absolute darkness.\nSssshh!\nAlex heard an incredibly silent rustling of leaves, and he gazed over.\nIt was here.\nAlex saw some white eyes looking at him from the top of a distant tree.\nThese were familiar eyes.\nAlex touched his coat, which looked identical to the creature's fur.\nAlex had named these creatures Stalkers.\nThis kind of creature had nearly killed him a month ago, and Alex had only won by sheer luck.\nThis time, things would be different.",

      "content": "Chapter 20 - Conviction\nAlex looked at the Stalker, and the Stalker looked back.\nSilence.\nOnly the cold wind could be heard.\nAlex slowly retrieved his sword and held it in his right hand. He no longer needed to carry it with both of his hands.\nStep.\nThen, Alex slowly stepped forward.\nThe Stalker looked at him from a distance, silently evaluating him.\nIn its mind, this animal was small, far smaller than it.\nIt had seen these kinds of animals before, and they always hunted in groups.\nYet, this one was alone.\nFrom what the Stalker had seen, these animals weren't very powerful. They could only be a real danger in a group.\nThey were slow.\nTheir bodies were weak.\nYet, this particular specimen felt different to the Stalker.\nMore dangerous.\nHowever, the more dangerous this specimen felt, the better its meat would taste.\nSuch creatures as the Stalkers were drawn to powerful prey. The more powerful the prey, the better.\nOn earth, predators avoided dangerous prey unless they were really desperate.\nBut here, things were different.\nThe more powerful something was, the more Mana it had stored in its body. After all, physical power without Mana took a being only so far. At some point, Mana was necessary to become more powerful.\nBecause of that, the predators that took more risks and survived had become more powerful and had fathered more offspring.\nAfter many, many years, every animal and creature in this world had the instinct of hunting powerful prey.\nThis was also why the wolves hadn't retreated when they had been attacked by the lizard.\nThe lizard had killed two of the four wolves, but the remaining two wolves had still charged at it in a frenzy.\nThis was how powerful the draw of power was for the creatures and animals of this world.\nAlex slowly walked closer as he kept his sword ready, never taking his eyes off the creature.\nThis was no longer the same Alex that had appeared in this world.\nThe old Alex had thought about many things.\nFamily, love, success, money, justice.\nHowever, all of these desires had been replaced with a thirst for power.\nPeople changed over the course of their life, but was such a drastic change in attitude and personality in only a single month normal?\nCould he still be considered as Alex?\nOr had he already become Shang?\nAlex didn't think about these things, but he had long decided that he would only walk forward, never looking backward.\nThe old world of Alex was slowly left behind as he walked into the darkness before him.\nHow long would it take until Alex looked back?\nWould he have already walked so far that he couldn't see his starting point anymore?\nIf that happened, Alex would have nothing left to orient himself on.\nThen, he would only walk forward blindly, in the darkness, in a random direction.\nChances were that he would end up walking in a direction the old Alex would have never chosen.\nStep.\nAlex arrived below the tree, and the Stalker was still looking at him.\nIt was still debating if it should attack him or not.\nDangerous prey tasted incredibly delicious, but if the prey was too dangerous, the Stalker would die.\nRight now, this being in front of the creature felt very dangerous.\nShould it attack?\nBANG!\nAlex jumped upward and swung with his sword at the Stalker!\nThe Stalker immediately jumped back!\nSHING!\nThe huge branch the Stalker had just been on was easily cut in two.\nSHING! CRK!\nAlex swung his sword to the left, burying it horizontally in the trunk of the tree. The sword got stuck, and Alex used it to reposition his body, putting his feet on the trunk.\nBANG!\nAlex shot away from the tree, pulling his sword out while doing so.\nThe first Stalker had used a similar move back then.\nFight or not fight?\nThe choice had been taken from the Stalker.\nAlex flew at the Stalker as it just landed on another branch.\nSHING!\nAnother branch was cut apart as the Stalker quickly moved along the tree towards the ground.\nCRACK!\nThe Stalker barely evaded another attack as Alex's sword cut through two-thirds of the tree's massive trunk.\nBANG!\nAlex shot towards the ground at the Stalker.\nBOOOM!\nAlex hit the ground, his sword creating a cut in the earth. The sound of Alex hitting the ground thundered throughout the forest.\nThe Stalker immediately made its decision.\nRun!\nToo dangerous!\nIt turned around and ran into the distance.\nBANG!\nAlex chased after it with explosive power.\nHowever, the Stalker was faster than Alex.\nAlex made a split-second decision.\nSHING!\nSomething seemingly passed the Stalker and hit the tree in front of it. The Stalker looked over and saw the dangerous weapon of the human being stuck in a tree.\nThe Stalker stopped.\nIt wasn't dumb.\nIt knew that these kinds of beings needed to use these sharp things.\nMaybe it could win?\nThe Stalker turned around to look at Alex.\nIt had made its decision!\nIt would kill this human!\nThe human had lost his most powerful weapon!\nHunger and greed took over the Stalker's mind as it saw Alex.\nBANG!\nHowever, just when the Stalker saw Alex, it was already too late.\nAlex hadn't stopped running, and the short moment of hesitation of the Stalker had given him enough time to catch up with it.\nAlex had reached the Stalker and hit it to the side of the head with an elbow.\nThe Stalker was stunned for a bit, and Alex jumped on its back.\nThen, he grabbed its chest from behind, put his arms through its armpit, and clamped his hands together on the Stalker's neck.\nIt was a full nelson!\nIt sounded ridiculous. Alex was using an MMA-move on a gigantic, cat-like creature in a dark forest.\nHowever, it was the best and most effective move.\nThe thin, stealthy, and fast frame of the Stalker had become its undoing. If it were bulkier, Alex couldn't have used that move.\nEven though Alex's weapon was now the sword, it didn't mean that he couldn't use other weapons as well.\nAlex was a trained MMA-fighter, and as long as he had enough time to study his opponent's body, he could glean the body's weaknesses.\nAlex had deliberately thrown his sword forward in an attempt to bait the Stalker into attacking him.\nIt was risky, but Alex preferred a more dangerous, direct fight to a lurking danger.\nWho knew if the Stalker decided to lurk around some more and strike when Alex didn't pay attention?\nHe couldn't risk that.\nThe Stalker flopped to the ground as its forelegs moved to the side, out of its control.\nThe Stalker hissed in a threatening manner and jumped on its back with its hindlegs.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex fell to the ground with his back, the entire weight of the Stalker pressing down on him.\nHowever, Alex was used to falling to the ground by now!\nSomething like this couldn't stun him anymore!\nThe Stalker hissed, but hissing wasn't enough. Its limbs couldn't reach its back, and Alex's hands were pushing down on its neck, stopping it from turning its head and biting him.\nAfter some seconds, the Stalker's hisses were replaced with screeches.\nCRK! CRK! CRK!\nThe Stalker's body was powerful, even more powerful than Alex's body, but it couldn't use any strength in this position, while Alex could use the gathered power of his arms, chest, and back.\nCRACK!\nThe Stalker's left shoulder broke, and Alex lost his grip due to the loss of resistance.\nUsually, breaking bone with a full nelson wasn't feasible when professional fighters fought, but Alex's body had become powerful enough to pull something like that off.\nAlex let go and pushed the Stalker away, throwing it to the side.\nWhen he had just come to this world, such a feat would have seemed impossible.\nThe Stalker quickly tried to get to its feet and scampered away.\nHowever, it couldn't get far in its slowed-down speed.\nSHING!\nAlex had retrieved his sword and cut through the Stalker's left thigh, severing its leg.\nAlex's sword was insanely sharp.\nThe Stalker fell over, and Alex ran to its head.\nSHING!\nThe fight was over.\nAlex calmed down as he looked at his kill.\nIt was so much easier than he had anticipated.\nThe Stalker's power and speed were far superior to him.\nIf the Stalker had directly fought Alex, the fight would have been far more dangerous.\nIt could have simply jumped around Alex, baiting him into striking with his sword. Then, if he made a mistake, it could have bit Alex's arm.\nAlex's arm had been able to survive the bite of a panther, but a Stalker was on an entirely different level.\nSuch a bite would have torn Alex's arm off.\nAt that point, he could only wait for his death.\nThe fight could have gone either way.\nYet, it hadn't.\nFrom the very first moment of the fight, Alex had been in control.\nTheir powers were about equal, but the Stalker hadn't been able to use its power.\n'Initiative and intimidation,' Alex concluded as he looked at the corpse. 'My attacks made it lose its resolve. From the very beginning, it believed that it couldn't win, and its lack of conviction made it unable to properly fight.'\nAlex's eyes narrowed. 'I learned a valuable lesson today. If I don't remember this lesson, I might be in the same place as the Stalker in the future.'\n'I must always fight with my life on the line or flee without looking back when I'm faster. It doesn't matter what I choose, but when I make my choice, I have to put my all into it without any second thoughts.'\nAlex put his sword away and grabbed the severed leg.\nAfter that, Alex grabbed one of the legs of the Stalker and pulled it.\nSSSHHH!\nThe sound of something heavy being dragged along the ground could be heard in the forest tonight.\nAlex had killed many animals in the past month.\nHowever, today, he had killed his first creature!",

      "content": "Chapter 21 - Hegemon\nCRRR! CRRRR!\nThe sound of something heavy being pulled along the ground resonated throughout the forest. Except for this sound, everything else was silent.\nThis was the sound of the Stalker's corpse being pulled through the forest.\nWhite snowflakes fell down around Alex as he walked through the deep darkness.\nSuddenly, Alex saw a slight golden light coming from the sky. If his eyes hadn't been strengthened, he wouldn't have noticed this little bit of light.\nAbove the layer of clouds was a golden shooting star, its light barely visible to him.\n'A golden shooting star that's so bright that I can even see it through a thick layer of clouds?' Alex thought with furrowed brows. 'That's strange. However, this world is already strange enough. This is just one more oddity added to the pile.'\nAlex looked back down.\nThis golden shooting star didn't concern him.\nAfter a while, Alex arrived at his clearing.\nHe hadn't seen another animal or creature all this time.\nIf it had been a month ago, Alex would have met at least one creature that had been drawn to him due to the sound, but Alex's position had changed.\nHe was no longer the vulnerable, new survivor.\nNow, he was one of the hunters of the forest.\nA normal animal would be frightened off by the Stalker's corpse, and a powerful creature would be able to feel Alex's power.\nStalkers weren't the most powerful creatures in the forest, but they also weren't weak.\nAlex still remembered the two gigantic beasts he had seen when he had just arrived.\nIf Alex tried to attack them, he wouldn't even know how he had died.\nHe couldn't possibly fight against such behemoths with his current power.\nCurrent was the keyword.\nWhen Alex arrived at his clearing, he let go of the corpse and sat down beside it.\nShing! Shing!\nAlex took out his sword and started to skin the corpse.\nIn the silent, cold night, only the sound of cutting could be heard.\nIt was like Alex was the only being in this world as only darkness surrounded him.\nAfter Alex was done with skinning the Stalker, he took the hide and put it near his hut.\nThen, Alex grabbed some dried wood from his wood stock. Alex had gathered a ton of wood the past couple of days. After all, when the true winter arrived, the snow would make all the trees wet. Alex needed dry wood to create a fire, and he needed enough to get through the winter.\nJust as Alex put down the first branches, his head turned to one of the edges of the clearing.\nGreen eyes.\nAlex knew these eyes.\nIt was the lizard that had stolen food from him more than once, the one that had shot the fireballs at the wolves.\nHowever, the entire dynamic had changed.\nWhen they had first met, the lizard had been overpowering. If it hadn't exhausted itself against the wolves, it could have killed Alex.\nThe second time they had met, they had been about equal.\nNow, Alex was clearly the more powerful one of the two.\nAlex had a lot of confidence in his ability to evade the fireballs, and even if he couldn't evade them, he could still use his sword or cloak to block them.\nThe lizard was dangerous but not nearly as dangerous as a Stalker.\nBoth of them knew that Alex was the more powerful one.\nAlex scratched his chin in thought as he looked at the lizard from a distance.\nAlex decided that he wanted to try something.\nSplosh!\nAlex grabbed the severed leg of the Stalker and threw it over to the lizard. The lizard jumped to the side and looked at Alex warily.\nAlex didn't move and only looked at the lizard for a while.\nThen, Alex went back to creating his fire.\nThe lizard was a bit confused for a while, but it couldn't resist its instincts. It carefully walked closer to the leg, constantly keeping an eye on Alex.\nPACK!\nThe lizard bit the leg and ran away at full speed.\nAlex only smirked.\n'Reptiles on earth are solitary creatures. It's nearly impossible to create any kind of connection with them, even when one has them as pets for years.'\n'However, this world is different from earth. The Stalker was also smart enough to notice that I was weaker without my weapon. I think creatures are more intelligent than animals.'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ 'Who knows? Maybe if I work hard enough, I can build some kind of cooperation with that lizard. If its power increases, I might even be able to use it as a form of oven or dryer. That would make surviving the winter far easier.'\n'Actually, it's quite surprising to find reptiles in such a cold climate. Most reptiles are cold-blooded by nature, and they would freeze to death in these temperatures. I guess the fire the lizard can use keeps it warm in the winter.'\n'Anyway, that's for the future. Right now, I need to see if this will actually work,' Alex thought as he continued building his fire.\nAlex had placed the fire over ten meters away from his hut for a specific reason.\nAfter some minutes, quite a big fire roared in front of Alex.\nAlex cut some parts off the Stalker and grilled them around the fire. However, he didn't dry the hide yet.\nWhy not?\nHe had a reason for that.\nAlex continued to build his hut for the next hour.\nBoom!\nA distant sound of something heavy hitting the ground could be heard.\nAlex smirked.\n'It actually works. Should I be happy or scared?'\nThe sound grew louder over the next two minutes until something appeared at the edge of the clearing.\nIt was absolutely enormous, and it had gigantic, green needles.\nIt was the hedgehog!\nThis was why Alex had built the fire so far away from his hut.\nAlex assumed that the hedgehog had found him the last time due to the fire and smell of meat, and sure enough, the hedgehog had appeared once again.\nAlex didn't hide but sat several meters away from the fire, leaving enough space for the hedgehog.\nThe hedgehog looked at Alex for a second and then focused on the fire.\nJust like last time, the hedgehog warmed itself over the fire for several minutes. While warming itself, it ate the entire Stalker.\nAfter some more minutes, the hedgehog walked away from the fire, not destroying it this time.\nAfter some meters, it stopped as it shook its body again.\nThis time, it dropped far more fruits.\nAfter shaking off the fruits, the hedgehog left the clearing again.\n'Sacrifice flesh to the Forest God, and you shall be awarded with fruit,' Alex thought with a smirk.\nAlex looked at the retreating hedgehog and saw hundreds of fruits growing on its needles.\nHow much would his power improve if he could eat all of those?\nHowever, Alex would never attempt to steal these fruits.\nThis hedgehog was humongous, very noticeable, and incredibly slow. Alex knew that the Stalker wasn't the powerful creature in this forest, which meant that there had to be more powerful ones.\nYet, the hedgehog still walked around at a leisurely pace.\nNo beast could miss this hedgehog since they could hear it from hundreds of meters away.\nThis only meant that either nothing attempted to kill the hedgehog or that everything that attacked the hedgehog died.\nThis hedgehog couldn't be simple at all.\nEven more, Alex remembered the gigantic lizard he had seen on the mountains on his first day. That lizard had only been on the mountains, even though it could enter the forest. The thing it had killed had also been in the forest, not in the mountains.\nThere was no reason for the gigantic lizard to not enter the forest. After all, there was much more food here.\nYet, it hadn't entered.\nAlex assumed that this hedgehog was the very reason for that.\nThe gigantic lizard had to have seen the hedgehog, but it hadn't attacked.\nWith all of these clues combined, Alex concluded that the hedgehog was probably the most powerful being in the entire basin.\nJust one of its hundreds of fruits already made Alex's body nearly explode with Mana.\nThis thing was a true monster, the true hegemon of this basin!\nAlex still remembered that the God had said that he should only go to a different wilderness when this one no longer posed any danger. This probably meant that the wilderness surrounding the basin was far more dangerous.\nSo, why wasn't any creature from there entering this basin? The mountains couldn't possibly stop them since they weren't even that high.\nThis was the hedgehog's territory.\nIt probably even counted as a mighty creature on the outside.\nHowever, another question was, did no creature dare to enter…\nOr did every creature that entered die?\nAlex wasn't sure, but his attention was quickly drawn to the fruits on the ground.\nAlex smirked.\nThere were so many!",

      "content": "Chapter 22 - The Enemy Is Complacency\nAlex gathered the fruits.\nThere were 26 of them, which was insane!\nThe pig Alex had fed to the Hegemon before had only given him five, with one being taken away by the lizard.\nBut now, Alex received 26!\n'Obviously, the Hegemon is rewarding me with fruits based on the power of the prey,' Alex thought as he gathered the fruits. 'What defines power? I guess it's mostly the amount of Mana inside of a being. The pig had only been a normal animal, but it had been quite massive. A normal wolf would probably only give me three fruits or something like that.'\nAs Alex took up the last fruit, he looked at it with narrowed eyes. 'I can train my body without problems when it comes to muscles, but power isn't only muscles.'\n'I need powerful bones to resist my own power and to continue fighting after taking a heavy hit.'\n'I need powerful organs for the same reason.'\n'There's probably even something that can increase the effectiveness of my blood. More powerful muscles need more oxygen, and the blood is the thing that transports said oxygen.'\nAs Alex thought about that, he furrowed his brows. 'Wait a second. If my body requires more oxygen, I would be taking far deeper breaths. After all, my muscles are already more powerful than any human's muscles on earth. Yet, I'm breathing normally. In fact, now that I think about it, my breathing became even shallower.'\n'It's almost like the more powerful my body gets, the less oxygen it needs, which makes no sense,' Alex thought. 'I wonder, can Mana work as some kind of replacement for oxygen? I think that's a possibility.'\nThen, Alex sighed.\n'Well, even without that, blood still plays an integral function for the body, and even if the blood itself has no chance of increasing its effectiveness, my blood vessels still need to become stronger. After all, I don't want to pop a vein whenever I bow forward.'\n'In short, everything's important. My normal training gives me all I need for my muscles, but I require these fruits for everything else. I need to damage my body so that it can absorb Mana, and any damage to my bones or organs could prove fatal without a lot of Mana.'\nAlex looked at the fire in the center of his clearing.\nThe fire crackled peacefully, and it was the sole source of light in a sea of darkness. The white snowflakes danced around it as the warm air pushed them away and melted them.\nThe sky was dark.\nThe forest was dark.\nOnly the fire wasn't dark.\nWhat kind of impact did this image have on Alex?\nAlienation.\nFrom what?\nFrom the fire.\nThe fire gave comfort to humans, but Alex didn't need comfort.\nAlex's goal was not comfort and safety but power.\nAlex wasn't prey anymore.\nHe was the hunter.\nAlex's killing of the Stalker had reaffirmed this mindset.\nHowever, deep inside, Alex still wanted to rest by the fire. He wanted to let go of all the pressure and dangers all around him.\nBut Alex wouldn't do so.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex had learned a lot from his fight with the Stalker.\nThe two opponents had been about equal in power.\nYet, Alex had basically come out of the fight without even being injured or in danger.\nThe Stalker hadn't even been able to resist.\nWhy?\nWillpower!\nConviction!\nAlex had gone all-in and had put his life on the line. He had never thought about retreat, and he had only attacked. He would either win or die attacking!\n'I've been in similar situations before,' Alex thought as he gazed at the fire. 'Back when I trained my ass off for my fights, I had to uphold a strict diet, had to uphold a strict training regime, had nearly no free time.'\n'I had the uncertainty of my future on my shoulders. If I lost my fight, I would not have any ways to make more money. I decided to go all-in in my training, and if I didn't win this gamble, I would fall into oblivion.'\n'Keeping up with all of this was easy for a couple of weeks, hard for a couple of months, but the closer it got to the day of my fight, the heavier the burden became.'\n'Some days before my first fight, I wanted to just run away. I cried and wanted to end my life. All the pressure was overwhelming, and no matter what I did for the remaining couple of days, it wouldn't offset everything I have invested in the past years.'\n'My fate had already been decided by my past actions. Yet, I didn't know what fate would be chosen for me.'\n'It was a feeling of powerlessness. It was like I no longer had control over my destiny.'\nAlex looked at the fire.\n'This fire reminds me of that place. I could abandon everything and simply sit down. I could find solace and escape this pressure. After all, I'm powerful enough to survive. I don't need to go through this pain anymore.'\nAlex's eyes steeled. 'Yet, in order to achieve my dream, I need discipline. One day of skipping training will lead to another day a week later, which will lead to another day a week later until it becomes normal. Then, I will eventually take another day off, and the same thing will repeat itself.'\n'In the end, I will have mostly given up.'\n'Complacency will have invaded my being.'\nAlex turned around and took hold of the Stalker's hide.\nThen, he went over to the fire and hung the hide near it.\nAlex turned away from the fire again and walked away.\n'I can't give in to complacency!'\nAlex arrived at his bag and looked through it.\n'I still have newly-made jerky left. That's enough food for several days. I shouldn't eat anything right now since I will be training. I don't want to eat jerky just to puke it out again,' Alex thought.\nAlex grabbed one of the fruits and looked at it with conviction.\nYet, no matter how convicted and stalwart his mind was at the moment, he still felt deep terror when he looked at the fruit.\nThis fruit symbolized another harrowing, torturous, traumatic experience.\n'I'm sure there are other ways to train my organs, bones, skin, blood vessels, and so on. I can't imagine everyone going through this hell. The path to power is hard, but not that hard, probably.'\n'Sadly, I don't know these other methods. Also, would these other methods be better than this one? Would they be faster?'\n'I don't know.'\nAlex hesitated a bit, but after gnashing his teeth, Alex finally swallowed the entire fruit.\nAlex's body immediately felt like it started burning again.\nHowever, Alex noticed a difference.\n'The sensation of burning is not as intense as before,' Alex thought with fiery eyes. 'I will still explode if I don't do anything about this Mana, but it doesn't feel as immediate as before.'\n'My body has become more powerful, and the fruits no longer have as big of an effect anymore.'\n'Although, one fruit should still be enough for two jumps.'\nAlex climbed the tree and looked around. Thanks to the Mana, his eyes had become so strong that he could see the entire clearing and some surroundings from the tree, even in the dead of night.\nAlex didn't want to be ambushed while he was injured.\n'The Mana also heals my head, even if I don't feel the burning there. Even if I lose consciousness, as long as I don't immediately die, the Mana should heal me.'\nThen, Alex jumped.\nAlex had never jumped from so high.\nSome seconds later, Alex hit the ground.\nHe hit the ground spread-eagle.\nEvery part of his body hit the ground at the same time.\n\"Hurgh!\"\nSuddenly, Alex threw himself to the side as he puked more blood. Then, Alex took a deep breath.\nIt felt like he hadn't breathed for a minute.\nAlex looked to his side at the floor, and he saw a huge pool of blood.\nAlex looked at his body and saw that there were basically no injuries.\n'I've lost consciousness for half a minute to a minute,' Alex realized.\nIt was a terrifying thought to know that it had been a very real possibility that Alex might not have woken up again.\nAlex felt the Mana in his body and, sure enough, he had enough for one more jump.\nAlex gritted his teeth.\n'I need to continue!'\nAlex climbed the tree again.\nOn this night, for several hours, the loud sounds of explosions could be heard from this part of the forest.\nThe animals didn't go there since it sounded like a terrifying predator.\nThe predators didn't go there since the sound would scare away all the prey.\nThis was one of the reasons why Alex decided to train at night.\nEveryone was more careful, and no one would want to go to a noisy place in a forest at night.\nThus, Alex hadn't been disturbed in his masochistic training for the entire night.",

      "content": "Chapter 23 - Cold\nSnow stormed throughout the forest.\nThe ground was covered with nearly a meter of snow, and the trees had transformed into silhouettes of ice and snow.\nIt was the height of winter.\nIt had been about four months since Alex had arrived in this world.\nCurrently, it was noon. Sadly, the sun couldn't be seen clearly as a violent blizzard stormed throughout the forest.\nJudging by the nearly horizontal icicles on the trees, this blizzard had been going on for a long time already.\nCRK! CRK!\nSuddenly, something pushed the snow beneath a huge, dead tree to the side.\nAn opened door was revealed, which led to a small, warm area beneath the tree without snow.\nA figure cloaked in black stepped out of the area.\nEverything about the figure had been hidden by black fur, including the figure's head.\nThe figure looked like a faceless shadow of fur.\nThis was Alex.\nAlex had finished his hut in time, but the hut hadn't been able to resist the storms in the winter, which was why it had collapsed.\nNow, Alex only lived in a tiny \"room\" at the bottom of the dead tree. Only a diagonal barrier of wood protected him from the cold snow.\nThis was the best Alex could do in this situation.\nLuckily, it was effective enough.\nRight now, the temperatures even reached -40 degrees Celsius, which was frightening for someone living outside.\nHowever, Alex didn't feel cold at all.\nSomething was keeping him warm, even while traveling through the forest.\nAlex slowly stepped through the forest.\nWhy was Alex walking through this blizzard?\nBecause he had no other choice.\nAlex's food had run out several days ago, and he had wanted to wait for the blizzard's end.\nHowever, the blizzard just didn't end.\nA conspicuous, dark shadow traveled across the snowy forest, the only dark thing in sight.\nIt was an oddity.\n'I need food,' Alex thought. 'As soon as I get some food, I can continue training.'\nAlex had summoned the Hegemon of the forest several times by now, and he had somewhat grown accustomed to the terrifying experiences that followed.\nAdditionally, Alex's swordsmanship had also increased considerably.\nAlex hadn't had any guided training on swordsmanship, but he had continually trained all the different kinds of attacks and moves he could perform.\nAs long as his movements became more fluid, faster, and more powerful, his combat power should increase.\nAlex didn't know if he had any weaknesses in his movements, but there was no way to rectify them, even if he had them.\nThe creatures weren't smart enough to notice the openings in Alex's movements.\nAlex pushed himself through the snow.\nHowever, he wasn't exactly walking upright.\nThe snow was already very high, and Alex decided to use the snow as cover. Because of that, Alex walked with a lowered posture, not showing himself anywhere. He would only raise his head above the snow cover occasionally to search for prey.\nAlex had always traveled through the forest at night.\nWhy?\nBecause he needed stealth.\nIn the day, Alex's prey would see him from a distance and run away.\nNow, this was no longer a problem.\nAlex's body had become terrifyingly powerful, and he had no problems in reaching 50 – 60 kilometers per hour even with all his equipment.\nNow, the light of day was an advantage instead of a disadvantage for him.\nHowever, there had been one more reason why Alex hadn't traveled during the day.\nPowerful predators.\nWhat did this have to do with the time of day?\nWell, most predators hunted at night.\nWhy?\nFor the same reasons as Alex had hunted at night. They needed stealth in order to catch their prey and run away.\nYet, what about the predators that hunted during the day?\nOne only had to think back to earth and think about what predators were active during the night and which predators were active during the day.\nIn North America, the predators that were active during the night were mostly small animals like weasels, for example. Yet, bears were active during the day.\nThere were fewer predators active during the day, but the ones that were active had a higher likelihood of being far more powerful.\nAdditionally, if a weaker predator were active during the day, there would be a high likelihood that they would be caught by a bigger predator due to the light of day.\nThe ones that needed to hide were active during the night.\nThe ones that didn't need to hide were active during the day.\nAlex had killed two more Stalkers in the past couple of months, and he had also killed a gigantic anaconda, which had been a bit more powerful than a normal Stalker.\nThe anaconda had shot ice projectiles at Alex, which he had been able to defend against with his new cloak, at least to some degree. The projectiles still shot through Alex's cloak, but he hadn't been injured that heavily.\nThe ice projectiles also explained why such a tropical animal as an anaconda lived in such a cold climate.\nEver since then, Alex hadn't felt challenged again.\nThis was also one of the reasons why Alex came out during the day instead of the night.\nThe God had told Alex that he should become more powerful by throwing himself into danger.\nRight now, as long as Alex kept himself hidden during the day, he wouldn't be in any danger anymore.\nThis was enough to survive but not enough to reach true power.\nAlex knew that he had to push himself.\nAnd wasn't this a prime opportunity for him?\nSuch a powerful blizzard would make it harder for a big creature to move around. Additionally, the blizzard would interfere with the eyes, nose, and ears of the creature.\nIn comparison, Alex had a thin, nearly transparent piece of skin over his eyes. This protected his eyes from the blizzard.\nAlex traveled through the snowy forest for nearly thirty minutes, leaving behind a crevice in the snow cover.\nAlex had seen about two white rabbits up to now, but he wasn't interested in them.\nHe wanted bigger prey.\nAfter a while, Alex arrived in front of a lake. This was the lake in the middle of the forest.\nAlex wanted to come here since there were fewer trees in the way. If something traveled across the frozen lake, Alex would be able to spot it.\nThe lake was about a kilometer wide, making it neither small nor big.\nHowever, the closer Alex got to the lake, the colder he felt.\n'Is the temperature dropping?' Alex thought.\nWhen Alex reached the edge of the lake, he felt like the temperature had dropped by another 20 degrees.\nWhat was going on?\nWhy was it so much colder here?\nAs Alex looked at the lake, he got his answer.\nAlex narrowed his eyes as he saw the two things in the middle of the lake.\nOne thing was something that was difficult to describe. It was some form of force. Some white air came out of the lake in the form of a spire, about two meters tall. It almost looked illusory. Several icicles and broken pieces of ice were seemingly levitating around the white, illusory spire.\n'This is the thing that's causing all this coldness, and I'm sure that this thing wasn't here before,' Alex thought.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Then, Alex looked at the other thing. 'And that thing too.'\nWhat was the other thing?\nAn ice bear.\nA big one.\nA really big one.\nThe ice bear was probably nearly three meters tall, which was insane. That was the height of an elephant!\nThis thing probably weighed several tons!\nBy now, Alex had cultivated some sort of feeling of animals and creatures.\nHow powerful did this creature feel?\nFar more powerful than a Stalker.\nMore powerful than the ice anaconda.\nProbably a bit weaker than the gigantic lizard Alex had seen on the mountains on his first day.\nFar weaker than the Hegemon.\nThe bear slept beside the spire.\n'This spire probably releases something that makes it easier for creatures with the ice element to become more powerful. I don't know if there are types of Mana, but if there were, this would probably be concentrated Ice Mana.'\nAlex looked at his surroundings a bit more and found some bones strewn around the lake.\n'I think nearly all animals with an Ice Affinity are drawn to this spire, but this bear has probably won the bloody battle.'\nAlex remembered the gigantic lizard he had seen on his first day.\n'The lizard didn't dare to enter the basin, but this bear did. Yet, this bear only feels a bit weaker than that lizard.'\n'This probably means that this bear represents the highest power allowed by the Hegemon. Judging by the fear of the lizard, anything more powerful than this bear will probably be killed by the Hegemon. I don't know how the hedgehog does it, but that's the only explanation I can come up with.'\nAlex narrowed his eyes and gritted his teeth.\n'It's a huge risk, but I'm supposed to risk my life. It doesn't feel like I would be helpless in front of this bear, but it also doesn't feel like I can win. It's a gamble.'\nAlex's fist shook in conflict, but eventually, it relaxed.\n'If I turn back now, I will turn back again later. I can't allow that!'\nAlex readied his sword and patted the side of his torso a bit to check for something.\nThen, he walked towards the lake.",

      "content": "Chapter 24 - Bear\nAlex stepped onto the ice.\nThe surroundings became even colder as Alex walked forward.\nHowever, Alex quickly noticed something that would change the entire dynamic of the fight.\nAlex nearly fell over as his feet lost their grip.\n'It's fucking ice! How could I have overlooked something like that?!' he thought in frustration.\nAlex stabbed his sword into the ice. The sword easily entered the ice, almost like it didn't exist.\nThen, Alex pushed himself forward, using his sword as an anchor point in the ice.\nAlex practiced a bit to get used to his new form of movement.\nAfter some minutes, Alex had a good grasp on how to move properly on the ice. Luckily, the bear was still sleeping. It either didn't notice him, or Alex didn't feel dangerous enough for it to care.\nAlex looked at the bear with narrowed eyes. 'It can use its claws to run on the ice. It has the advantage in that sense.'\nThen, Alex smirked. 'However, the ice can also be disadvantageous to it if I use it correctly.'\nThen, Alex slid forward.\nAfter around 200 meters of gliding across the lake, the bear opened its eyes and lifted its head as it looked at Alex.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex's heart jumped as their gazes met.\n'Powerful!' Alex thought. 'But I can't always live in safety! If I want power, I have to push myself!'\nThe two only gazed at each other for several seconds.\nCRRRR!\nAfter the bear saw that Alex didn't move, it started to silently growl, the vibrations going across the lake.\n'It either feels threatened or annoyed by me,' Alex thought.\nAlex continued sliding forward.\nWhen the bear saw that Alex didn't retreat, it stood up as it turned to him. Its growl became louder as it tried to scare Alex away.\nAlex came closer.\nNow, only 100 meters separated them.\nSuddenly, the cold air around the bear transformed into a cold storm.\nThe bear took a deep breath, and Alex felt his hairs stand on end.\nAlex immediately jumped to the side.\nSHING!\nA spear made of ice whizzed past Alex's body with insane speeds.\nBANG!\nThe spear of ice punched through a tree and got stuck in the tree behind that one.\nAlex took a deep breath.\nThis bear was no joke!\nAlex had already met several beasts with these kinds of elemental powers, but this bear was on a completely different level.\nThe lizard Alex had seen a couple of times could only throw weak fireballs.\nThe anaconda had only been able to shoot some cold wind.\nThe Stalker also had an elemental power, but it hadn't been used as a form of attack but for keeping it hidden and silent.\nYet, this bear could transform its elemental powers into an actual attack.\nAlex tightened the grip on his sword and continued going towards the bear.\nThe bear noticed that Alex had evaded, and it quickly formed another spear.\nThe spear shot forward.\nBANG!\nThis time, Alex blocked the ice spear with the side of his sword. Alex could have evaded the attack, but he wanted to test if he could block it. It was better to test it from a distance in case his sword broke. If that happened, he could still flee.\nAlex's arms shook, and his body got stopped by the power of the spear, but he had not gotten injured.\nAlex quickly rammed his sword into the ground and shot himself forward with all his power.\nIn an instant, Alex's speed multiplied as he shot towards the bear.\nThe bear roared in aggression as another ice spear materialized, which it then directly shot at Alex.\nCRR!\nAlex fell on his ass and continued sliding forward, the spear passing over him, freezing parts of his hair.\nAlex had arrived in front of the bear.\nBOOOM!\nAlex rammed his sword into the ground to stop himself, and a meaty paw exploded on the ice in front of Alex. If he hadn't stopped himself in time, he would have been killed.\nIce exploded in front of Alex as part of the icy lake was destroyed.\nAlex's eyes never lost their conviction, even if he had several brushes with death.\nConviction!\nHe had to attack!\nAlex used his sword as support and threw himself over it.\nWHOOSH!\nA paw swiped past Alex, barely hitting the sword.\nYet, the hit had already achieved its effect. Alex's sword was thrown to the side. Alex still managed to keep hold of his sword, but the trajectory of his jump had changed.\nAlex had wanted to attack the bear from above, but he just passed it by on its upper left.\nThe bear quickly stood up onto its hind legs and tried to swipe at Alex again.\nThe bear's speed was incredibly fast, far faster than Alex had anticipated.\nAlex put his sword in front of himself. He couldn't evade while being in the air, which meant that he could only block.\nCRK!\nSuddenly, the ice beneath the bear broke, and the bear's hind legs fell into holes.\nBecause of that, the bear's swipe missed Alex.\n'Just as I've thought,' Alex thought as he landed on the other side, sliding away. 'The bear is already incredibly heavy. Obviously, the ice is sturdy and thick, but there has to be a limit to the ice's strength. It can resist the bear's weight when it's spread apart, but not when it's concentrated.'\nThe bear shouted in frustration and pulled itself out of the ice.\nAt the same time, Alex put his sword into the ice again and changed his trajectory.\nThere was now a distance of 20 meters between them.\nThe bear turned to Alex.\nThen, it charged forward, the ice cracking beneath its powerful strides.\nAlex used his sword like a ski pole to control his trajectory and speed as he circled around the bear.\nThe bear came closer, and Alex used his sword to immediately and sharply change his trajectory.\nBOOOOM!\nAnother powerful paw hit the ice, but Alex managed to evade it.\nAlex continued sliding around, and the same thing repeated itself once again.\nHow was the bear not able to hit Alex? It shouldn't be that stupid, right?\nEver tried to hit a fly in the air with a hand?\nIt was difficult.\nWhy?\nIt wasn't because of the speed. After all, a human's hand could move faster than the fly.\nNo, the problem was the fly's ability to change trajectories in an instant.\nThis gave the fly the ability to evade things that were moving even faster than it.\nThe bear was faster than Alex, but Alex's sudden changes of trajectory were throwing it off.\nSSSSSS!\nThe sound of something cutting could be heard as Alex slid around the bear.\nThe bear grew more frustrated as it realized that it couldn't hit Alex.\nCRK!\nIt formed another ice spear and shot it at Alex.\nBANG!\nAlex blocked it with his sword. Then, he continued sliding around the bear.\nThe bear shouted in frustration and condensed another ice spear.\nSuddenly, Alex changed his trajectory again and slid towards the bear.\nBANG!\nAlex blocked the spear again and got stopped by it.\nSuddenly, another spear appeared.\nBANG!\nAlex was pushed back, and he fell onto his back due to the force, sliding away from the bear.\nAnother spear.\nDING!\nDue to Alex lying on the ground, the spear passed over him and buried itself in the ground behind him.\nCRK!\nAlex slid right into the spear, and Alex frantically pushed himself away.\nAlex had stopped his slide by using his free hand to stop himself by grabbing the spear. However, the Stalker's coat between Alex's hand and the spear froze in an instant!\nThis spear's temperature was frighteningly low!\nIf Alex had grabbed the spear directly, his free arm would have been frozen solid!\nThe frozen part of Alex's coat broke off like a piece of ice.\nAlex quickly jumped to his feet and slid away again, barely dodging another ice spear.\nThen, he slid towards the bear again, dodging another spear.\nSuddenly, Alex jumped.\nAlex looked with fiery eyes at the bear.\nHowever, Alex gritted his teeth when he realized that the bear didn't stand up!\nHis entire plan hinged on the bear standing up!\nInstead, another ice spear appeared above the bear.\nAlex changed the position of his sword. He had wanted to strike the bear, but he had to block again.\nCRK!\nYet, Alex's eyes widened in horror as a second spear formed above the bear.\nThen, both spears shot at Alex.\nAlex couldn't block both of them!\nHe would get hit by one!",

SHING!\nThe two spears shot forward, and Alex's sword blocked one of them.\nSHING!\nHowever, the other one punched through Alex's left shoulder.\nBefore Alex's left arm completely froze, he issued one last command to it.\nWhoosh!\nAlex's coat was thrown up as his left arm lifted upward.\nThen, Alex's left arm and a huge part of his torso froze over in nearly an instant.\n\"Now!\"\nAlex shouted.\nAs Alex's coat was thrown upward, his torso was revealed, and something new with it.\nHow had Alex been able to stay warm in such insanely cold weather?\nAround Alex's torso was a large, green lizard! It was curled around Alex's torso, and it radiated a ton of heat!\nIt was the lizard that Alex had met on his first day!\nThe lizard had already prepared itself.\nBANG!\nThe lizard shot a fireball in the bear's face.\nBOOM!\nThe fireball exploded on the bear's head, making it scream in fear and pain.\nIts eyes were completely destroyed!\nIts fur was singed, and burns littered its face. However, it wasn't dead yet.\nIn the chaos, the bear stood up.\nCRK! CRK!\nThe bear's hind legs broke through the ice again, and the bear's torso hit the front of the ice as it lost its balance.\nCRK!\nSuddenly, the ice in a rough circle around the bear broke.\nBack when Alex had slid around the bear, he had cut out the part of the ice where the bear was standing on. The bear's fall broke the ice.\nCREEEAAK!\nSuddenly, the icecap started tilting towards one side. The bear's hind legs were in the center of the icecap, while its torso was on one side.\nLike a human that leaned completely to one side while wearing a lifebuoy in the water, the icecap completely tilted.\nBANG!\nUntil it turned 180°!\nThe bear's body was now below the ice as its hind legs stuck out from the ice.\nAlex gritted his teeth as the burning pain from his left side seared itself into his mind.\nAlex heard a muffled roar from below the ice as the icecap shook with power.\nWhen Alex landed, he used his sword to shoot himself towards the bear's legs.\nCRACK!\nAlex swung his sword at one of the legs, and it cut to the middle of the leg, only being blocked by the bone.\nThis was the first creature that managed to resist Alex's sword to some degree.\nAlex immediately swung a second time!\nCRACK!\nThe bone was broken, and with another swing, the bear's left hind leg was cut off.\nA shower of blood shot out, coating Alex's entire body.\nAlex could hear another terrifying roar beneath the ice, but he couldn't get distracted now.\nBANG!\nAlex hit the bear's other leg before it managed to free itself.\nBANG!\nHowever, suddenly, something shocking happened.\nThe bear's other leg was pulled below the surface of the lake with terrifying speed!\nAlex's eyes widened.\n'This couldn't have been the bear! That yank was too powerful!'\nSilence.\nOnly the blizzard roared.\nThe lake was completely silent.\nAlex slowly walked forward and looked through one of the two holes.\nRed!\nThe water beneath the hole was blood red!\nThis wasn't right!\nFor Alex, the atmosphere on the lake changed.\nFrom a natural calm to a terrifying calm.\nAlex didn't feel like he was on a lake but on the roof of a terrifying creature's domain.\nThe way the bear had been pulled underwater had been unnatural.\nIt was like a giant hand had simply yanked the bear out.\nSuddenly, the silent sound of something small coming out of the water could be heard.\nAlex's body shuddered, and he quickly jumped away from the two holes.\nWhat had he just seen?!\nA long and thin tentacle had silently come out of one of the holes!\nThe tentacle directly went to the middle of the lake, towards the ethereal ice spire in the middle.\nThe tentacle seemingly didn't end as it extended for over 20 meters!\nWhen the tentacle arrived beside the ethereal spire, it moved around it, seemingly inspecting it.\nAfter some seconds, the tentacle pulled back into the water.\nCRRRR!\nThen, the two holes in the ice quickly got repaired.\nIt was like the ice hadn't been damaged at all!\nAlex had completely stopped breathing as he watched all of this unfold.\nHe didn't want to make any sound.\nAfter a bit, Alex noticed something else, and what he saw shook him to the core.\nThe ethereal spire in the middle of the lake.\nIt had grown bigger and more powerful!\nImmediately, Alex combined several clues into a terrifying picture.\n'This is not some natural Mana phenomenon,' Alex thought.\n'This is bait!'\n'This… thing created this ethereal spire to lure in a powerful creature! Then, it would consume the creature after a while!'\n'This is a trap!'\nAlex took a deep breath.\nIf it were another creature like the bear, Alex wouldn't feel so distraught.\nHowever, the power with which this thing had pulled the bear down had been too frightening.\nIt was like a grown man that had yanked on a mere piece of grass!\nThe yank had been so powerful that it was probably harder to not accidentally tear the bear apart than to pull it out of the ice!\nThe bear and this thing were not on the same level at all!\n'Maybe the hedgehog actually isn't the most powerful thing in this forest?' Alex thought with terror.\n'What if the hedgehog isn't the reason why there are no powerful creatures here?'\n'What if the reason is that thing in the lake?'\nSuddenly, Alex felt something pull on his coat, and Alex nearly jumped back.\nHowever, he realized that it was only the lizard that had climbed down.\nThe lizard seemingly wanted to pull Alex towards the ethereal spire in the middle of the lake.\nThe lizard looked at Alex's frozen left arm, then at the spire, at Alex's arm again, and at the spire again.\nAlex also looked at his arm and gritted his teeth.\n'My arm is basically destroyed,' he thought with pain.\nAlex's entire arm had been frozen solid, and the cold even started to invade his torso.\nAlex knew that his left arm had already completely died.\nAlex looked at the ethereal spire.\nJust like before, ice formed around the spire continuously, and it danced around it in a calm manner.\nAlex's instincts were telling him that there was a ton of Mana in there!\n'However, this is that thing's bait,' Alex thought. 'The lizard thinks that this spire can help me. Maybe its ice powers can heal my dead arm?'\nAlex looked at the calm lake, and he felt the overbearing pressure in the air.\n'But if that thing notices me, I'm dead.'\nAlex looked at his left arm again.\n'However, I already lost an arm. This will severely cripple my fighting ability,' Alex thought.\nThen, he looked back at the spire.\n'Should I try getting the spire or not?'\nSilence.\nA minute passed.\nAnd then, Alex made his decision.\nAlex turned around and left the lake.\n'I can't risk it. There is probably a way to heal my arm on the outside, but I can't revive myself from the dead,' Alex thought.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ 'It's too risky!'\nCREEAAK!\nHowever, Alex suddenly heard the sounds of trees being bent from the shore of the lake.\nAlex knew that sound!\nSure enough, just a bit later, the hedgehog had appeared at the edge of the lake.\nAlex looked at the hedgehog, and the hedgehog looked at Alex.\nThen, the hedgehog looked at the spire in the middle.\nThen, it looked at Alex again.\nIt seemingly looked at Alex with expectation.\nAlex looked at the hedgehog's actions, and he felt like he could understand its intentions.\n'Does it want me to grab the spire?'",

      "content": "Chapter 26 - Ethereal Spire\nAlex looked at the hedgehog, unsure if he was judging its intentions correctly.\nAlex pointed towards the spire with his sword and looked at the hedgehog.\nThe hedgehog didn't react.\nIt continued looking at Alex with expectation.\n'Fuck! Does it want me to get this ethereal spire for it?!' Alex thought.\n'Is it forcing me to retrieve it?!'\nAlex started sliding towards a different direction of where the hedgehog was.\nCREEEAK!\nThe hedgehog followed Alex's new trajectory, and it quickly arrived at the spot where Alex was sliding towards.\n'Fuck! It won't let me go! It will probably kill me if I exit the lake!'\nAlex was stuck between a rock and a hard place.\nHe either had to go against the hedgehog or the thing in the lake.\nBoth of these creatures were far beyond his capabilities to deal with!\nAlex felt stifled and frustrated beyond belief.\nOthers were deciding his fate!\nHe hated that!\nAlex looked with hate at the hedgehog, but its demeanor didn't change.\nIt still looked at Alex expectantly.\nAfter a while, Alex clenched his fist.\n'If I have to choose, I'll choose to help the hedgehog,' Alex thought. 'The hedgehog has at least rewarded me when I gave it something. Instead, that thing in the lake will probably just ignore or consume me.'\n'Sadly, I'm not powerful enough to make demands. I'm completely at the mercy of the hedgehog's whims.'\nIn the end, Alex shooed the lizard away.\nHe didn't want it to get hurt.\nAlex turned to the ethereal spire, and the lizard understood what Alex meant.\nWithout hesitation, the lizard shot towards the shore of the lake, vanishing into the forest.\nThe hedgehog didn't even look at it.\n'Sure enough, the lizard only cares about me as long as I'm of use to it. It will abandon me at the first sign of weakness. It might even kill me when I'm showing weakness,' Alex thought.\nHowever, he had already expected something like that.\nThe lizard wasn't Alex's pet.\nIt was a wild animal and a reptile on top of that. Reptiles weren't known for their affection towards other animals.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Eventually, Alex moved around the ethereal spire and stopped behind it.\nRight now, the spire was in front of Alex, and behind the spire, on the edge of the lake, was the hedgehog.\nAlex would speed towards the spire, absorb it, and continue rushing towards the hedgehog.\nThis was the best method he could come up with.\nAlex took a deep breath and mentally prepared himself.\nSHING!\nThen, Alex put his sword into the ice and shot himself forward.\nAlex accelerated as much as he could.\nAnd then, Alex's frozen arm hit the ethereal spire!\nWHOOOM!\nIt was like the spire had been disturbed!\nThe ethereal spire became deformed.\nThe spire's form changed, and it started to curl around Alex's arm.\nIt was like a soft band made of paper that was being pulled along.\nSSSHH!\nThe sound of sizzling could be heard as the ethereal form of the spire wrapped itself around Alex's body in an instant.\nAlex felt like he was touched by something of terrifying coldness!\nYet, Alex's body wasn't being frozen or injured.\nAlex felt a cold sensation creep into his body. However, the outside of his body started to warm up again.\nIt was like the cold sensation was moving through his body.\nAlex felt the cold sensation enter his head of its own volition.\nYet, there seemingly was a blockage that stopped it from advancing.\nAfter a moment, the cold sensation gave up trying to get into Alex's head, and traveled towards his frozen arm again.\nSuddenly, Alex's left arm regained feeling, and he felt like his arm became even colder than before.\nAlex barely managed to jerk his left arm in panic.\nWHOOOM!\nSuddenly, a terrifyingly cold wind came out of Alex's left arm.\nThe cold wind hit the ice cover beneath Alex, and an additional layer of ice formed on that spot.\nYet, something shocking happened at the same time!\nAlex's arm instantly warmed up!\nIn actuality, Alex's arm felt quite hot suddenly!\nIt was like Alex had gathered all the cold in his body and had expelled it.\nEven the ice spear, which was stuck in his shoulder, was melting away.\nIt was like Alex's left arm had worked with the same principles as an air conditioning unit!\nIn order to make a room cold, an air conditioner needed to transport the heat somewhere else.\nIf the inside of a room was as hot as the outside and the air conditioner was turned on, the inside would become colder, and the outside would become hotter.\nThe hot temperature was gathered and expelled.\nAlex's arm had seemingly done something with the same principle but reversed.\nAlex had cooled the surroundings, resulting in his left arm becoming hotter.\nHowever, Alex had far bigger problems right now and didn't have any time to analyze this right now.\nAll of this had happened in just three seconds.\nAnd three seconds after Alex absorbed the ethereal spire…\nBOOOOOOOM!\nA gigantic, brown… boulder-like thing broke through the middle of the lake.\nIt was over ten meters tall and nearly three meters wide.\nA line went through the boulder-like thing.\nAlex knew what this was, and his heart beat fiercely in his chest.\n'That's the beak of a gigantic octopus!' he realized.\nIf already the beak of the octopus was ten meters long, how huge was the entire creature?!\nThe beak had punched through the middle of the lake, and it had closed around it.\nThe octopus had probably assumed that Alex was still there.\nLuckily, Alex had grabbed the ethereal spire while sliding.\nAlex looked with terror behind him.\nBOOOOOOOM!\nSuddenly, the entire lake exploded!\nThe gigantic octopus had realized that it had caught nothing, and its entire body broke out of the lake.\nIt couldn't let go of its bait!\nIt cost too much Mana to condense something like that!\nTentacles nearly 50-meters-long stretched across the lake as a gigantic head came out of the water.\nThe eyes of the octopus quickly looked around, and they immediately spotted the running Alex.\nBOOOOOM!\nThe tentacles all punched down at the frozen lake.\nSurprisingly, the ice didn't break.\nThat was because the octopus had used its ice powers to increase the hardness of the ice.\nAs the octopus smashed its tentacles down, its body left the water and flew towards Alex.\nIt had thrown itself over 50 meters into the air, right towards Alex!\nAlex's heart nearly stopped.\nThis octopus was too fast!\nIt would catch him in an instant!\n'I'm dead!'\nThe tentacles of the flying octopus stretched towards Alex.\nIt would catch him in a second!\nAlex looked forward with desperate eyes.\nYet, what he saw made him despair.\nThe hedgehog had turned around!\nIt wasn't even looking at him anymore!\nAlex's eyes opened widely with terrified eyes.\nAnd then, everything changed!\nBANG!\nIt was one loud, explosive sound.\nIt was like a grenade had gone off!\nSuddenly, Alex felt a storm hit his body.\nA terrifying wind had suddenly picked up, and Alex's body was hurled across the lake uncontrollably!\nAs Alex was thrown around, he managed to catch a glimpse of the octopus in the air, and an image was burned into his mind!\nOver 20 extremely long, green needles had buried themselves into the octopus' body!\nThis was the reason for the explosive sound and the terrifying storm!\nThe needles had exploded off the hedgehog's body, had passed by Alex's body with unimaginable speeds, and had buried themselves into the octopus!\nThe wind of the needles had thrown Alex across the lake!\nThe sheer power of the needle-explosion had stopped the massive octopus in the air!\nThen, Alex saw the hedgehog quickly peek behind itself.\nAfter that, it turned away again.\nBANG!\nAnother terrifying explosion and another twenty needles shot through the octopus!\nThe ground beneath the hedgehog broke due to the unimaginable force, and the octopus was thrown across the lake.\nBANG!\nAnother explosion and the octopus was thrown even farther away!\nAlex quickly lifted himself off the ground again and ran towards the edge of the lake.\nThe hedgehog turned around, and then it exploded forward.\nBOOOOM!\nThe hedgehog exploded with absolutely terrifying speed!\nIt was racing around the lake, avoiding the ice. It knew that the ice wouldn't be able to withstand its weight.\nAlex's eyes opened in shock as he saw the unreal speed of the hedgehog.\nHow could he have thought that the hedgehog was slow?!\nThat thing was moving with over 200 kph!\nAll the trees around it were utterly annihilated, creating a terrifyingly long trail of destruction.\nBANG!\nMeanwhile, the octopus landed outside the lake, inside the forest.\nIts tentacles were violently flailing around, destroying everything in its surroundings.\nSome seconds later, the hedgehog arrived near the octopus.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nAlex couldn't see, but he heard the sounds of two gigantic beasts fighting in the distance.\nThis was not a fight he could get involved in!\nHowever, the sounds vanished in less than ten seconds.\nThe fight was already over!\nAlex took a deep breath.\nThen, he slowly made his way to the fighting area.\nAlex could see some green needles peeking over the trees, and they were moving around.\nHe couldn't see any gigantic tentacles above the trees.\nThis meant that the hedgehog had won.\n'Sure enough, the Hegemon is the Hegemon,' Alex thought.\nAlex slowly calmed down as he realized that he had managed to avoid death.\n'I wonder if the hedgehog will reward me? I hope so. Fleeing now makes no sense. If the hedgehog wants to kill me, there's nothing I can do.'\nAlex only hoped that the hedgehog's personality wouldn't suddenly change into a cruel one.",

      "content": "Chapter 27 - Experiment And Trade\nAlex walked towards the area where the giant octopus had landed.\nHe didn't want to miss out on any potential rewards the hedgehog had for him.\nWhile Alex was walking to that place, he looked at his left arm.\nHis left arm was no longer frozen, and it actually felt a bit hot. Sadly, his left arm was still severely injured. The freezing of organic material completely destroyed its structure, severing veins, and many other things.\nAlex's left arm hadn't been in pain while it had been frozen, but as soon as it had thawed, Alex felt searing pain coming from it.\nAlex couldn't really move it much, but he could still experiment with it.\nThe ethereal spire had entered Alex's left arm, and it remained there. He had already accidentally shot some cold air out of his left arm earlier, and Alex wanted to know how that worked.\nAlex was already familiar with how it felt to move Mana, and he willed for the cold Mana in his left arm to explode.\nSSSHH!\nA blast of cold air left Alex's left arm. Since his left arm was still limply hanging around, the cold hit part of Alex's left leg and the ground.\nThe ice below Alex's left arm grew by a bit, and the coat on Alex's left leg completely froze.\nHowever, Alex was too busy with something else.\nAs soon as Alex had willed the Ice Mana to explode, his arm started to burn. Well, it wasn't burning literally, but it felt like it was burning.\nAlex quickly ran to one of the spots with destroyed ice. The octopus had destroyed a huge part of the lake when it had surfaced.\nSSSSSS!\nAlex put his arm directly into the icy water and gritted his teeth. The sound of something hot touching cold water could be heard as soon as Alex's arm hit the water.\n'Fuck! That's so hot!' Alex thought. 'Are you serious?! You have Mana, and you follow the Laws of Thermodynamics?! You want to make stuff cold, so you have to make other stuff hot?! Why can't you just do something magical?!'\nAfter a while, Alex pulled his arm out and moved it through the air for a bit.\nHis arm had received several burns.\nHowever, it was coated with a thin coating of ice now.\nHis arm definitely felt colder than before.\n'My arm is colder than before. So, let's try again!'\nSSSHH!\nAnother blast of cold air, and Alex immediately dipped his arm into the cold water again.\n'It's not as hot as previously, but it still feels like I touched a hot plate or something,' Alex concluded.\nAfter a while, Alex pulled his arm out again.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ 'I wonder, can I use less?'\nAlex tried to suppress the Mana but also made a bit of it explode.\nSSSH!\nA cold wind left Alex's left arm again, and Alex's arm heated up again.\nHowever, this time, Alex's arm wasn't burning hot.\nIt was just uncomfortably hot, the temperature that would make someone sweat profusely.\nYet, in exchange, the cold air that left Alex's left arm wasn't as cold as in the earlier blasts.\nAlex scratched his chin as he thought about everything he had witnessed. 'So, my arm heats up proportionally to how cold the air is. I'm not sure, but I think the amount of air leaving my arm is the same as the weight of my arm. Because of that, the blasts are quite powerful.'\n'Now, I need to test something else.'\nAlex grabbed his left arm with his right arm and pointed it at his face.\n'Just a little bit. Just a tiny, little bit,' Alex thought.\nSSSSSHH!\nAlex's head was blown back by the storm coming out of the arm. However, since he had only used a little bit, Alex's face wasn't injured.\nOnly some icicles had formed on Alex's face.\nAlex rubbed the icicles off his face and looked at his arm with excitement.\n'Interesting,' Alex thought, scratching his chin. 'I only used a tiny fraction, and my arm probably only heated up by a single degree. Yet, the air on my face was slightly colder than the surrounding air.'\n'This means that this blast uses the outside temperature as a reference when cooling something, not the arm itself.'\n'So, theoretically, if it were -40°C right now, and if my arm were 20°C hot, and if I unleashed a blast equaling 20°C, the blast of air would be -60°C, and my arm would reach 40°C.'\nAlex scratched his chin as a complicated expression appeared on his face.\n'That means the power of this ability relies heavily on my environment. After all, if I were in some desert that's 50°C and I did the same thing, my arm would reach 40°C, and my opponent would get a comfortable breeze of 30°C hot air.'\n'However, in a cold environment, the effect would be different,' Alex thought as he looked around. 'Sure, the creatures living in such a cold environment have a great cold resistance, but that's only true to a certain extent.'\n'A beast living in a 50°C hot desert wouldn't mind a blast of 30°C hot air. However, a beast living in a -40°C cold tundra would have some issues with a blast of -60°C cold air.'\n'Even more, I can reduce the temperature of my left arm even further in cold weather. I could run around with a 5°C cold arm without issues. It would simply feel very dull, numbs, and awkward. However, I could unleash a blast of 35°C. In a cold climate, this would severely damage someone. After all, the blast would nearly reach -100°C!'\n'Additionally, if I'm willing to pay some injuries, I can even blast them with like 60°C or something. Sure, my arm would get severe burns and would become useless until I healed it, but my enemy would be frozen.'\nAlex scratched his chin.\n'There surely are some uses for this ability in a fight. My sword is one-handed anyway, leaving me with a free arm.'\nAlex had been walking all this time, and he finally came close to his goal.\nAlex passed a tree and saw an area of absolute destruction.\nThe trees were all destroyed, and many gigantic needles poked out of the unmoving octopus.\nRight now, the hedgehog was calmly munching on the octopus, seemingly without a care in the world.\nAlex walked up to one of the tentacles and saw how it towered over him.\nThis was one of the thicker tentacles of the octopus, and just its width was at least three meters.\nIt was like Alex stood before the fleshy wall of an estate.\nThat tentacle was probably fifty meters long, which simply seemed unreal.\nAlex jumped onto the tentacle and walked along with it.\nThen, Alex walked over to the spot where the hedgehog was currently munching away and stopped before it.\nThe hedgehog continued eating, but after some seconds, it noticed him.\nThe hedgehog extended its head to Alex and sniffed several times.\nAlex became a bit nervous.\nMaybe it smelled the ethereal spire in his body? After all, it was currently munching on the creator and actual owner of the ethereal spire.\nMaybe Alex smelled similar to the octopus?\nHe hoped not!\nAfter a bit of sniffing, the hedgehog pulled its head back and looked at Alex.\nThen, it looked at the octopus below Alex.\nThen, back at Alex again.\nAfter that, the hedgehog walked to the tentacle where Alex had come from.\nCRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH!\nAfter a minute of biting, the hedgehog had severed the tentacle from the corpse.\nBANG!\nThen, the hedgehog threw the tentacle a couple of meters into the distance with a kick from its paw.\nAfter that, it looked at Alex again for a while.\nAnd after that, it went back to eating.\nAlex realized what the hedgehog meant.\nIt had given Alex one of the tentacles!\nAlex became excited for a bit.\nThe Octopus probably had an insane amount of Mana stored in its body!\nHowever, Alex quickly deflated and sighed.\nThat tentacle weighed so many tons!\nHe couldn't possibly eat all of that.\nAlex scratched his chin for a bit.\nThen, he walked to the end of the tentacle and tried to move it with all his power.\nAlex managed to lift the last couple of meters of the tentacle and rotated it slightly towards the hedgehog.\n\"Hey!\" Alex shouted. \"I can't eat that! You take it!\"\nThe hedgehog stopped munching and looked at Alex.\nAlex pointed at the tentacle, shook his head, and then pointed at the hedgehog.\nThe hedgehog looked at Alex for a bit and realized what he meant.\nThe hedgehog walked over, bit down on the tentacle, and moved it back to the corpse, showing that the tentacle now belonged to it.\nAlex looked expectantly at the hedgehog.\nThe hedgehog looked at Alex for a while.\nTen seconds of nothing happened.\nThe hedgehog was probably thinking hard on what to do.\nThen, it looked at the sky for a bit, seemingly thinking about something.\nLastly, it looked at Alex again.\nRRMM! RRMM! RRMM!\nThe hedgehog's body began to vibrate slightly in a rhythmic pattern.\nAlex recognized the sound.\n'Hey, isn't that the weird sound dogs make before they barf?' Alex thought.\nSure enough, the hedgehog opened its mouth and spat something out.\nHowever, it wasn't barf, but something else.\nAlex's eyes widened in shock at what he saw!",

      "content": "Chapter 28 - Affinity?\nWhat had the hedgehog spat out?\nSomething brown hit the ground. It almost looked like a regular piece of earth.\nHowever, the brown piece of earth quickly dissolved into mist, which gathered in the air above it.\nIn the end, some brown mist had formed in the shape of a spear, and several clumps of earth materialized in the air and fell to the ground.\nAlex almost couldn't believe it.\nIt was another ethereal spire!\nHowever, it also seemed logical to Alex.\nIf the octopus could create an ethereal spire, why couldn't the hedgehog?\nFrom what he had seen, the octopus' ethereal spire had something to do with the Ice Element, and the hedgehog's ethereal spire was obviously of the Earth Element.\nCould Alex have two ethereal spires in his body?\nAlex walked over to the ethereal spire, which was slowly being burrowed by the earth forming around it.\n'I should first try my right arm,' Alex thought. 'I don't know if the two spires will cancel each other out or something.'\n'I just hope I won't explode or something.'\nAlex put his sword to the side and touched the brown ethereal spire with his right hand.\nThe spire wrapped itself around Alex's right arm and vanished into Alex's body.\nAlex felt how the ethereal spire moved throughout his body.\nFirst, it traveled through his right arm to his head.\nHowever, just like with the previous one, this ethereal spire seemingly couldn't reach Alex's mind. It was like something was blocking its way.\nAfter that, the ethereal spire went to Alex's left arm, and Alex became nervous.\nHow would the spires interact?\nAlex felt how the brown ethereal spire entered his left arm and then…\nNothing happened.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ After a bit, it exited Alex's left arm and went to his legs.\nThen, it inspected Alex's torso.\nLastly, the ethereal spire went back to Alex's head.\n\"Huuurgh!\"\nAlex felt like he had barfed, and the ethereal spire left Alex's body through his mouth.\nThen, it landed in front of him and simply stayed there.\nAlex blinked a couple of times as he looked at the brown ethereal spire.\n'Well, seems like I can't use that. Does it have something to do with the strange Affinity the God was telling me about?' Alex thought.\nThen, Alex looked at his left arm.\n'Do I have an Ice Affinity?' Alex thought. 'Honestly, I'm not so sure. The God told me that my Affinity would be very special, and, honestly, if I had an Ice Affinity, my left arm probably wouldn't heat up if I used that spire. I can't imagine every Ice Mage burning to a crisp as soon as they use a spell.'\nAlex scratched the back of his head.\n'I mean, my Affinity obviously has something to do with Ice, but it probably isn't pure Ice. At the same time, it probably has nothing to do with Earth. Wonder what it is,' Alex thought.\nAlex looked at the hedgehog with a complicated expression.\n\"Hey, I can't use that!\" Alex shouted.\nThe hedgehog looked at Alex again.\nAlex took two steps away from the brown ethereal spire.\nSlurp!\nWithout waiting for a second, the hedgehog slurped up the ethereal spire.\nObviously, it hadn't been comfortable with handing something like that over.\nThat was probably also why it had thought over its decision for so long earlier.\nThen, the hedgehog walked away from the octopus and began violently shaking.\nPlonk! Plonk! Plonk!\nAn avalanche of fruit fell off the hedgehog's needles.\nIts needles became completely empty of fruit!\nThere were hundreds!\nAlex's eyes widened.\nHe knew how powerful these fruits were!\nAll these fruits couldn't even compare to a single tentacle of the octopus or one of the ethereal spires?!\nEven more, the hedgehog seemed rather happy with that trade.\nIt had appeared neutral when it gave Alex the tentacle.\nWhen it gave Alex the ethereal spire, it had definitely been unwilling.\nBut when it had given Alex the fruit, it seemingly hadn't minded a single bit.\nThis meant:\nHundreds of fruits < tentacle < ethereal spire.\n'Huh, apparently, I made quite a steal by absorbing that ice spire,' Alex thought.\n'However, how do I even transport all of these fruits?' Alex thought as he scratched his chin.\nThere were several mountains of fruits, all about a meter tall.\nAlex sighed.\n'Obviously, I can't transport all of them. Well, let's forget about returning home. I can just train here,' Alex thought.\nAlex looked at the blizzard storming around him.\n'Also, with that new ability, I can keep myself warm. As my blood travels through my left arm, the temperature of my arm will be distributed along my body. As long as it's not too cold, that's enough to heat my entire body. It's essentially not any different from what my body is naturally doing anyway.'\nCrunch!\nAlex looked at one of the mountains and saw a familiar creature.\n\"Of course you return as soon as you're no longer in danger,\" Alex said with a sarcastic tone while looking at the lizard.\nThe lizard had returned and had eaten one of the fruits.\n\"Well, you helped me in dealing with the bear, so you can get some of the fruits,\" Alex said.\nThe lizard mostly ignored Alex. After eating the fruit, it went over to a tree, climbed it, and laid down.\nAlex also went over and ate one of the fruits.\nBy now, Alex needed two fruits for one \"attempted suicide\" of training.\nHowever, for now, Alex only ate one.\nWhy?\nSSSSSSS!\nAlex looked at his left arm as it released sizzling sounds.\nThis was the sound of Alex's arm healing with rapid speeds.\nFor once, Alex felt quite lucky.\nIf he hadn't grabbed the ethereal spire, and if he hadn't used it, his arm would have probably shattered and fallen off at some point.\nAlex didn't want to find out if he could regrow entire limbs.\nProbably not.\nHowever, since his left arm was still attached and not frozen, it could receive the nutrients and Mana from the fruit and heal.\nAfter a bit, Alex moved his left arm around with practiced ease.\nFinally, he could move his arm again!\nAlex looked at the other fruits for a while and then at the hedgehog, which was still munching away on the octopus. Its stomach seemed endless.\n'I probably don't have to be very careful around here. I'm pretty sure that no beast would dare to come close to the hedgehog's food. The lizard is only here because it had met the hedgehog several times when we exchanged stuff.'\nAlex looked back at the fruits.\n'Well, it's time for a lot of pain!'\nAlex ate two fruits, climbed a tree, and jumped off with all of his power.\nAlex flew high into the air, did several flips, and perfectly hit the icy ground with the front of his body.\nAlex knew that, at some point, trees wouldn't be high enough anymore.\nWhen that happened, Alex would need to find an alternate method of training his entire body.\nWhen the hedgehog heard the loud impact of Alex falling to the ground, it turned to Alex and looked at him with confusion.\nWhat was that human doing?\nAlex convulsed on the ground in unending pain, and the hedgehog only stared at him in confusion.\nAfter a while, Alex stood up, ate some more fruits, and repeated the process.\nAfter watching Alex for a couple of repetitions, the hedgehog went back to eating the octopus.\nThat human was weird.",

      "content": "Chapter 29 - Human\nAlex gathered everything he owned and checked if he got everything.\nAfter looking over his broken shed one more time, he nodded in appreciation.\nThen, Alex jogged towards the south.\nIt had been about half a year since he had arrived in this world, and today, he would finally leave this wilderness!\nHe had killed the ice bear about two or three months ago, and he had already used up all of the fruits he had gotten from the hedgehog.\nNear the end, Alex had realized that the fruits weren't that useful anymore.\nHe would need over ten fruits for one attempted suicide of training.\nThat wasn't so bad, and Alex could still get some use out of the fruits.\nHowever, there was a problem.\nFor the past three days, the hedgehog had refused to appear in front of Alex.\nNo matter how much he searched or how many fires Alex lit, the hedgehog just wouldn't come out anymore.\nWithout the hedgehog, Alex's progress had slowed down severely. Now, he could only train with the normal meditation, which felt far too slow to him.\nAdditionally, Alex hadn't found another beast on the level of the ice bear in the past couple of months.\nSure, Alex had found a couple new creatures, but they were all about as strong as the Stalker.\nBy now, Alex could beat a Stalker without even needing to use his sword.\nHis body was just that powerful.\nBecause of that, Alex had decided that it was time for him to leave the safety of the basin.\nIt was time to see the wider world!\nAlex jogged leisurely, but he still moved faster than the fastest human on Earth could sprint.\nThe trees acted as obstacles, which made Alex's journey a bit awkward, but he arrived at the edge of the basin in about an hour.\nIf he could run in a straight line, he could easily get there in less than half an hour.\nAlex touched his new coat and kept hold of his sword.\nHe didn't know what would await him on the other side of the mountain.\nThe basin was surrounded by mountains, and Alex would be traveling through a natural pathway between two of the mountains. He would need to awkwardly climb to a height of about 500 meters to pass the mountains. That wasn't really hard for his new body, but it was still higher than all of the trees in the forest.\nEven more, Alex wouldn't be surrounded by the forest anymore. Any beast would be able to see him as soon as he started climbing the mountain.\nAlex still remembered the gigantic lizard he had seen near the mountains on his first day.\nAlex was uncertain if he could win against such a beast.\nAt least, the mystery of why no truly powerful beast entered the basin had been solved.\nIt was obviously the hedgehog.\nIn the past, Alex had been unsure of why no powerful beast had been here. After all, the hedgehog couldn't be everywhere at once, right?\nWell, in a certain sense, the hedgehog could be everywhere at once.\nIts needles could.\nThe hedgehog would probably hear or smell the gigantic beasts. Then, it would run there and shoot them down from hundreds of meters away.\nAlex guessed that the hedgehog hadn't used his needles earlier since one needle probably cost it more Mana or energy than the prey was worth.\nHowever, if it were something like that big lizard, it would probably be worth it.\nThe mystery of why there hadn't been any powerful sea creatures had also been solved.\nA river stretched through the basin, and logically, there should be a couple of powerful creatures.\nWell, these creatures had obviously been consumed by the octopus.\nSure, with the death of the octopus, powerful sea creatures would probably appear in the basin, but Alex knew his own limits.\nHe could attempt to fight a powerful land creature, emphasis being on attempt, but he wouldn't have any chance when fighting such a creature in the water.\nThe basin had become useless to Alex, and it was time to move on.\nAlex looked at the path he would travel to, took a deep breath, and started climbing.\n\"I wouldn't go there if I were you.\"\nAlex's heart nearly stopped in fright.\nAlex quickly turned around and saw something he hadn't seen in over six months.\nA human!\nAn actual human!\nBehind Alex stood a middle-aged man in green robes. These robes reminded Alex of several dramas playing in the middle-ages. These were the robes that a dignitary would wear. They radiated splendor and respect.\nHe had green hair and a black beard, making him appear a bit mismatched.\nEven more, Alex felt Mana revolve around the person.\nThere was so much Mana!\n'First human contact in the new world! Don't be awkward!'\n\"Yo!\" Alex said with a slightly raised hand.\nIt was normal to greet others like this on the street. It was a relaxed greeting.\nThe man raised an eyebrow in skepticism when he heard Alex's greeting.\n\"What are you doing here?\" the man asked.\nSince Alex could pay attention to the words now, he noticed that the words didn't sound English, but they felt like English to Alex. The man obviously spoke a different language, but Alex felt like he was speaking English.\nIt was a weird feeling.\nIt was like a badly dubbed movie.\n\"I've been living here for the past six months, and I lived in the wilderness to become more powerful,\" Alex explained.\nThe man nodded.\nThen, the man pointed at Alex while reciting some confusing words.\nAlex's hair stood up.\nWas that a spell?!\nWould the man attack him?!\nAlex immediately jumped to the side and ran into the distance.\nThe man was surprised as he stopped chanting.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ He only looked at Alex running away.\nThen, the man spoke a couple of words.\nIt didn't even take him a second to speak all of them.\nBOOOOM!\nAn explosion of wind appeared behind the man, and his body shot forward with absolutely ridiculous speeds!\nIt was like he had been shot out of a gun!\nWHOOOM!\nThe man appeared in front of Alex in less than a second, and after another small explosion of wind, his body stopped.\nAlex's eyes widened in shock as he looked at the man in front of him.\nJust now, the man had been even faster than the hedgehog!\n\"Calm down,\" the man said evenly. \"My first word was +%&. You should know that this word is reserved for investigative spells.\"\nIn Alex's mind, the word the man was referring to sounded like pure gibberish. It didn't even sound like an actual word. It was more like a weird combination of noises that made no sense.\nHowever, Alex knew that he couldn't do anything against the man if he wanted to try something on him.\nIt was better to simply follow his instructions.\nThe man spoke the same words again, and after a while, Alex felt Mana gather around his body.\nAlex's body subconsciously absorbed the Mana, and Alex immediately felt refreshed.\nHowever, Alex was still confused about what the man was actually doing.\nThe man stroked his black beard in thought. \"It's just as I've thought. You're a Physi.\"\n\"A Physi? What's that?\" Alex asked.\nThe man raised his eyebrow again as he heard Alex's question.\nWas something wrong with this kid's head?\n\"Physi, as in, physical fighter, someone that can't practice Magic,\" the man said.\n'Physi?' Alex thought with an uncomfortable expression. 'That sounds like a nickname for a group of people in high school or college. Is that how physical fighters are referred to in this world, Physi?'\n\"What are you then? A Magi?\" Alex asked.\n\"Mage,\" the man answered.\nFor a while, the man had been suspicious of Alex's supposed memory loss and lack of common knowledge.\nHowever, if Alex were truly acting, his acting skills would be deserving of several awards.\nThere was no way that someone this weak could act this well in front of him.\n\"Why did you say that I shouldn't go to the mountain? I want to leave,\" Alex said.\n\"A Mid-Rank Gravel Lizard has its nest between those two mountains. If you disturb it, you will die,\" the man said.\n\"A Mid-Rank Gravel Lizard? What's that?\" Alex asked.\n\"Greyish-brown lizard,\" the man answered. \"About twenty meters long with an Earth Affinity. Gravel Lizards are beasts at the Second Realm. A Mid-Rank Gravel Lizard is in the middle of the Second Realm.\"\nThe man pointed at Alex.\n\"Judging by your physical power, you are in the Late First Realm. By fighting smartly and with lots of preparation, you can maybe attempt to fight a beast at the Peak of the First Realm, but one in the Middle Second Realm will directly kill you,\" the man said.\nAlex nodded, and his eyes shone in curiosity.\nFinally, he could get some actual information about this world!\nThese Realms the man was referring to were probably a sort of classification or quantification for power. The man had said that Alex was in the Late First Realm. Alex assumed that he had come to this world while being in the Initial First Realm, which meant he had made quite some progress.\nHowever, according to logic, a Mid-Rank Gravel Lizard was probably stronger than Alex just as much as the current Alex was stronger than the past Alex.\nThe past Alex and the current Alex couldn't be compared.\nAlex also remembered something else.\n\"I've also seen a polar bear, which was about three meters high and could condense ice spears. What was that?\" Alex asked.\n\"Ice Spear Bear, straightforward name. Beast of the First Realm. It sounds like a High-Grade Ice Spear Bear, according to what you've said. Did you kill one?\" the man asked.\nAlex nodded.\nThe man nodded back.\n\"Quite impressive for a Physi. You two should be at the same level. It's not a given that a human can fight against a beast on the same level. Well, at least not as a Physi,\" the man explained.\nAlex scratched his chin in thought. 'My body has become far stronger now. I guess, back when I fought the Ice Spear Bear, my body was probably in the middle First Realm.'\nAlex glanced at the man.\n'However, I probably shouldn't tell him that. I don't know him.'\n\"What brings you here?\" Alex asked the man.\n\"I'm here to ask you a question,\" the man said.\n\"Ask away,\" Alex answered.\n\"What happened to the Old Ice Octopus in the lake of this forest?\"\nAlex's body shook.\nNow, he knew why this man was here.\nHe was investigating what happened to the octopus!\nEven more, Alex knew why they were probably interested in it.\nThe ethereal spire!\nAnd where was the ethereal spire right now?\nAlex stealthily hid his left arm.",

      "content": "Chapter 30 - Whirlwind\n\"The Old Ice Octopus? Do you mean that gigantic octopus in the lake?\" Alex asked.\nThe man slightly narrowed his eyes as he heard Alex's words.\n\"Yes. What happened to it?\" the man asked.\nActing like Alex hadn't seen anything would be too obvious of a lie. After all, the octopus had died, and the destruction it had caused had been massive and loud.\n\"It was killed by the huge hedgehog,\" Alex said.\nThe man raised an eyebrow. \"Killed by the Earth Fruit Hedgehog? What happened?\" he asked.\n\"I wasn't there for the entire fight, but I was near the lake. I heard a loud explosion and saw a gigantic octopus jump through the air!\" Alex explained animatedly.\n\"However, something shocking happened after that! Tens of gigantic, long needles punched through the octopus, and I saw it land towards the north of the lake, in the middle of the forest. I saw the gigantic hedgehog charge over to that area, and after a couple more explosions, everything quieted down. I'm pretty sure that the hedgehog has killed the octopus,\" Alex explained.\nThe man stroked his beard in thought.\n\"What you say makes sense, but I need to verify it. Wait here for a bit.\"\nAlex nodded.\nAlex wouldn't want to take the risk and flee while the man was away. The man probably had many ways to find Alex again. Fleeing would only awaken suspicion.\nThe man spoke several words, and this time, it took him nearly ten full seconds to recite them.\nObviously, the spell he was casting was very complex.\nAlex felt a storm of Mana coming to the man, and after he finished his spell, the man suddenly started to levitate!\nAn actual storm picked up around him, and Alex was nearly thrown into the distance.\nHowever, the storm only surrounded the man and lifted him upwards.\nThe trees violently shook around him due to the storm, and eventually, the man shot into the distance, right above the forest.\nAlex's eyes widened in shock.\n'He can fly! A human can actually fly in this world!' Alex thought.\nAlex had seen the powers the God had shown him, which were obviously superior to this man, but Alex would have never believed that the first human he would see could fly!\nFlying!\nThis was something every human dreamed of doing!\nIt symbolized freedom and power beyond one's imagination!\nAlex's thirst for power only increased in intensity!\nAs Alex continued thinking about what he had just seen, the man arrived at the lake and descended at its north.\nThere was a big area with destroyed trees, and the man could see several holes.\nThe man had only searched through the lake since the Old Ice Octopus was a water creature.\nWho would search for an octopus on land?\nThe man turned his gaze, and he saw a gigantic rock.\nHowever, this rock wasn't a rock but the octopus' beak.\nThe hedgehog couldn't eat something like that, which was why the beak was still here.\nEven after two months, the beak still lied there, in the middle of the forest.\nThe man ascended again and flew back to Alex.\nAlex was nearly blown back as the man slowly landed in front of him.\nAfter landing, the man nodded at Alex. \"You spoke the truth. I couldn't find the Old Ice Octopus, but I found its beak and several holes that are about as wide as the needles of the Earth Fruit Hedgehog. Seems like the hedgehog got quite a good meal out of this.\"\nThen, the man narrowed his eyes. \"No wonder the hedgehog acted this uppity towards me this year,\" he muttered. \"It thinks after becoming a High-Rank Earth Fruit Hedgehog, it can avoid paying its tribute.\"\n\"Stupid animal.\"\nAlex's body shook, and sweat ran down his back as he heard the man's words.\nAlex remembered a peculiarity.\nThe hedgehog hadn't visited him in three days!\nDid this man…?\n\"Sir, what happened to the hedgehog?\" he asked.\n\"What's it to you?\" the man asked with a cold glint in his eyes.\nAlex's body shivered. \"Well, I exchanged meat for the hedgehog's fruits several times.\"\nThe man raised an eyebrow. \"Sentiment? For a beast?\"\nAlex didn't answer.\n\"Don't be naïve,\" the man berated coldly. \"The hedgehog only traded with you because you are in the First Realm. It has killed plenty of humans in the Second and even some in the Third Realm. If you were in the Second Realm, it would have killed you as soon as it saw you.\"\n\"The Earth Fruit Hedgehog discerns enemies by smell. If the odor you give off has a certain density of Mana, its hunting instinct gets triggered. The hedgehog even killed the person that had fed it for twenty years after he reached the Second Realm,\" the man explained.\nAlex remembered how the hedgehog had always smelled him whenever it came near him.\nNow, that cute action no longer felt as cute!\nThe hedgehog had always sniffed Alex several times when they met.\nIf the hedgehog could even kill someone that fed it for 20 years, he would probably not be an exception.\nA cold shudder ran down Alex's spine.\n\"Thank you for your warning, sir,\" Alex said politely. \"Could I ask another question, please?\"\nAfter seeing the man fly, Alex had become far more polite.\nThe man nodded.\n\"Since you helped me in solving the mystery of the missing Old Ice Octopus, I can entertain some of your questions,\" he said.\n\"I saw a green lizard, about a meter long. It has the ability to shoot fireballs from its mouth. What kind of creature is that?\" Alex asked.\nThe man scratched his chin.\nFor once, he didn't have an answer immediately.\n\"Sounds like a Fire Tree Lizard hatchling,\" the man said. \"Fire Tree Lizards normally are not in the basin but in the mountains surrounding the basin. I'm guessing that it accidentally wandered into the basin after being born in one of the surrounding mountains.\"\n\"Fire Tree Lizards are beasts of the Second Realm. This means that they will reach the Second Realm as soon as they become adults. And you say that this thing is in here?\"\nAlex nodded.\n\"Do you know if it ate some of the Earth Fruit Hedgehog's fruits?\"\nAlex nodded again.\n\"Then forget about the lizard,\" the man said. \"Earth Fruit Hedgehogs gather their waste products in their needles, and the needles will eventually bear these fruits. These fruits will eventually fall down and remain on the ground.\"\n\"The fruits are filled with Mana, and every beast is drawn to these fruits. The hedgehog is wasting no Mana by creating these fruits. However, as a creature in the Third Realm, just its waste products already carry quite a significant amount of Mana.\"\n\"Over the long years, the fruits of the Earth Fruit Hedgehog gained a certain addictive property. Humans can still eat them since our minds are conscious, but beasts that only act on instinct can't resist these fruits.\"\n\"Since the Fire Tree Lizard has already tasted the fruits, it will stick around the Earth Fruit Hedgehog. Eventually, it will eat enough fruits to reach maturity and advance to the Second Realm.\"\n\"When that happens, the hedgehog will consume the lizard.\"\nAlex took a deep breath.\nThe hedgehog had long stopped being cute in Alex's mind.\nThis thing was a demon in disguise!\n\"Thank you for your teachings, sir,\" Alex said.\nThe man looked at Alex for a bit.\n\"As for your earlier question, I taught the Earth Fruit Hedgehog some manners and collected its Earth Mana Source. The Earth Fruit Hedgehog gets to live in my garden, but in exchange, it will give me one Earth Mana Source per year. I'm answering these questions for you since you helped me to solve the mystery of the missing Old Ice Octopus. Don't forget that.\"\nAlex's mind went so several places.\nHowever, why speculate when he could just ask?\n\"What's a Mana Source?\" Alex asked.\n\"Foggy, ethereal spears, about a meter high,\" the man answered. \"Mana Sources can act as a catalyst for elemental powers for beasts. The parents give Mana Sources to their offspring. A beast in the Second Realm can create an impure Mana Source, and a beast in the Third Realm can produce a pure Mana Source.\"\n\"Apprentices require a Mana Source in order to officially become Adepts. Most Apprentices can only use an impure Mana Source due to the difficulty of obtaining it, but wealthy families pay a lot of money for pure Mana Sources.\"\n\"That's why I'm here.\"\nAt this moment, the man looked like he had just remembered something.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"I haven't introduced myself yet.\"\n\"I'm Duke Whirlwind, a High Mage, and this…\"\nDuke Whirlwind gestured to the forest.\n\"Is one of my gardens.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 31 - Memory Loss\n'Duke?' Alex thought in surprise. 'That means that this world, or this country at least, operates on an aristocratic basis probably. As far as I remember, a duke was pretty high up in the chain of command.'\n'Additionally, he said he was a High Mage. He said Mana Sources are important for Apprentices to become Adepts. I can guess with quite some certainty that Apprentices probably reflect Mages in the First Realm, while Adepts are Mages in the Second Realm. The Third Realm should logically be a Mage, which would make the Fourth Realm a High Mage, probably.'\n'According to what he said, the hedgehog and the octopus are creatures of the Third Realm. The fact that he is in the Fourth Realm also explains how he could take care of them.'\n'This is probably a real big-shot! Fuck, I can't believe I greeted him with a yo!' Alex thought.\n\"I'm sorry for my earlier disrespect, Duke Whirlwind,\" Alex said with a respectful tone.\nDuke Whirlwind smirked a bit. \"You know, it's customary to refer to a duke as your grace,\" he said.\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, your grace,\" Alex said. \"I haven't talked to any nobles before. Please, excuse me for my negligence.\"\nSurprisingly, the duke chuckled for a bit.\n\"You really don't get under people much, do you?\" Duke Whirlwind asked.\n\"No, I don't, ehm, your grace,\" Alex said.\nThe duke chuckled again.\n\"You know, the your grace thing is antiquated. No one talks like that anymore. Referring to me with my title or simply by sir is already enough,\" the duke said with a slight smile.\nThe duke had been rather cold towards Alex at the beginning, but after he saw how innocent, gullible, and naïve Alex was, his mood brightened a bit.\nIt was rare to see a youngster that didn't try to lick his boots to get into his good graces.\n\"Oh, okay,\" Alex said, uncertain of how he should proceed.\n\"What's your name, young man?\" Duke Whirlwind asked.\n\"I'm aargh!\" Alex tried to say, but before he could even think about his name, a pain came from his mind. Alex grabbed the side of his head in pain.\nDuke Whirlwind was surprised when he saw Alex's actions. The young man was genuinely in pain. Even his veins were seemingly popping out of the side of his head. This was a sign of pain and stress, and something like that couldn't be faked.\n\"Are you injured?\" Duke Whirlwind asked neutrally. The young man obviously wasn't critically injured, which was why he wasn't very worried about him.\n\"No, it's just something that happens from time to time,\" Alex said as he took a deep breath.\n\"My name is Shang,\" Alex said.\n\"Shang?\" Duke Whirlwind repeated with interest. \"I've never heard of such a name. What about your last name, or is that your last name?\"\n\"That's just my name,\" Alex said with a defeated voice.\nHe really didn't want to abandon his old name, but there was really nothing he could do.\nHow long could he even remember his old name?\nBy now, Alex hadn't thought of his actual name in forever. Whenever he thought of it, the pain would return.\nThis meant that essentially no one, not even he, had spoken out or thought about Alex's name in half a year.\nWhen Alex wanted to introduce himself, his mind automatically went to the part in his mind where his actual name was located without even thinking about it.\nIt was like a closed door, suffused with powerful electricity.\nAlex knew what was behind the door, but whenever he touched it, he would get hurt.\nHow long would it take for him to forget what was behind that door if he could never check it?\nHow long would it take until the door seemingly vanished into obscurity?\nAlex knew that he still knew his name, but he actually didn't truly remember his name since he couldn't think about it.\nThis feeling was difficult to describe.\n\"Shang is my entire name. I don't have a first or last name. I am only Shang,\" Alex said.\nDuke Whirlwind combed his beard in interest. \"Someone with only one name. Are you from a farmer's or criminal's family?\" he asked.\nAlex sighed.\n\"I don't think I have a family,\" Alex said. \"Ever since arriving in this world, I have been alone.\"\nThese words sounded very different to different people.\nTo Alex, it was the truth. This body had probably been created out of nothing. So, logically, this body couldn't have a family. He also hadn't met a human since arriving in this world, making him alone.\nHowever, these words would be interpreted by different people differently.\nSomeone might think that Shang had had a clash with his family in the past, separating them.\nSomeone might think that Shang's family had died.\nSomeone might think that Shang was an orphan.\nSomeone might also think that Shang was simply a weak-willed child drowned in misery.\nHow did Duke Whirlwind interpret Alex's words?\nHe wasn't sure, but he guessed that Shang had probably lost his family in the past.\n\"That would explain why you don't have a last name. Who gave you the name Shang?\" Duke Whirlwind asked.\n\"It was a man. I talked for him for a bit, and he bestowed the name upon me. There was no other name I could use, so I accepted his name,\" Alex said, carefully navigating the question with deceptive truth.\nMaybe the God was known in his world?\nMaybe the God was not very popular in this world?\nWhat if someone knew the God and tried to experiment on Alex to find out more about the God?\nAlex didn't want to talk about the God.\nThere were simply too many unknown variables.\nDuke Whirlwind combed his beard in thought. \"That's quite an unbelievable story, but I can't sense any falsehood coming from you.\"\n\"There's no reason for me to lie to you,\" Alex said.\nDuke Whirlwind nodded.\n\"Why are you in my garden?\" he asked.\n\"That's a difficult question to answer,\" Alex said. \"The first thing I remember of this world is this wilderness. It's like this was where I started existing. I don't know anything about the world beyond this garden.\"\n\"However, I think I know the reason why I am here.\"\n\"I think I'm supposed to train in this wilderness and become more powerful before entering human society again,\" Alex said.\nAlex had decided to go with a mixture of memory loss and training.\nHis answers were vague enough that a lawyer could interpret Alex's word in many different ways, allowing him to get out of any future questions by continually adapting the meaning of his words.\nDuke Whirlwind raised one of his eyebrows as he kept combing his beard.\nThen, Duke Whirlwind spoke more confusing words.\nHe was casting another spell.\nAlex became more nervous since he didn't know what that spell would do.\nWhen the Duke finished his spell, Alex felt some Mana enter his mind.\nCasting the spell hadn't taken more than a second.\nAfter a second, the Mana left Alex's mind again.\nDuke Whirlwind's expression changed into a concerned one.\n\"Something's wrong with your mind,\" Duke Whirlwind said. \"I don't have enough knowledge in the field of Soul Magic, Mind Magic, anatomy, Flesh Magic, or any other related Magic Category to pinpoint the issue.\"\n\"I can just say that something doesn't feel right when I glanced at your mind.\"\nAlex's eyes widened.\n\"You can read my mind?!\" he asked in shock.\nDuke Whirlwind slowly shook his head. \"No, I'm not nearly powerful enough to do that. I also don't specialize in these fields. The spell I used simply sends Mana through your mind. I can see what form the Mana takes when it goes in and when it comes out.\"\n\"I don't know what happens inside your mind, but I can infer some things based on how the Mana looked when it came out again. Some of the Mana came out differently than expected, which means that some things in your mind are not as they are supposed to be. That's the extent of what I can find out.\"\n\"So, I lost my memory?\" Alex asked.\n\"That's a possibility,\" Duke Whirlwind said. \"Your mind has been changed, either by a person, by an injury, by trauma, or by whatever.\"\nAlex looked worried, but he was actually ecstatic inside!\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ This was just the excuse he needed!\nWith this, he could simply say that he lost his memory, and even doctors and powerful Mages would be able to confirm his words.\nIt was perfect!\n\"Can my memory be recovered?\" Alex asked.\n\"Unlikely,\" Duke Whirlwind said. \"You would need someone very proficient in Mind Magic and Soul Magic. Such powerful Mages only work for the truly wealthy Mages. It would even prove to be a heavy strain on my finances to summon someone like that.\"\nAlex sighed again, but he was actually happy that basically no one could take his excuse away from him.\n\"Anyway, you said you wanted to become more powerful?\" Duke Whirlwind asked.\nAlex nodded. \"Yes, sir,\" Alex answered. \"I think I can't practice Magic, but I also don't want to be a normal person. I want to become powerful!\"\nDuke Whirlwind nodded.\n\"I think you made a very wise decision in the past,\" he said. \"I don't know if you have been born in my territory or not, but whatever the case, you are in the best territory for your goal.\"\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" Alex asked.\n\"My close friend is the most powerful Physi in the world, and he has an academy for warriors and similar jobs not far from here. My presumption is that, before you lost your memory, you probably came here to train your combat experience before applying to the academy. It's a good decision.\"\n\"The academy's entrance exams are notoriously difficult for a reason.\"\nAlex became a bit uncertain. \"Should I train more for the entrance exam?\"\nDuke Whirlwind scoffed.\n\"You took down a High-Rank Ice Spear Bear.\"\n\"That's more than enough to join the academy.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 32 - Leaving The Wilderness\nAlex was quite surprised when he heard that.\nHadn't the God said that Alex should spend more time in the wilderness? As far as Alex could recall, the God had said that Alex should remain in the wilderness for about two years.\nHad Alex progressed that quickly?\nAlex's ego wanted to accept that reasoning, but he refused to underestimate a God.\nThe God probably wanted Alex to gain even more experience in combat.\nHowever, Alex honestly didn't want to spend even more time in the wilderness.\nHe wanted to live among humans again!\n\"How can I get to this academy?\" Alex asked.\n\"Go towards the eastern end of the garden. You will find a service entrance there. That entrance is for the keepers and the gardeners, and it has a couple of guards stationed there. When you leave the garden, you will quickly find a bigger village. Ask around for directions to Warrior's Paradise. That's a city, and when you get there, it will be easy to find the academy,\" Duke Whirlwind said as he took out a piece of paper and a pen.\nThen, Duke Whirlwind started scribbling on the piece of paper and put his thumb on the bottom of the paper.\nA second later, he gave Alex the piece of paper.\n\"Show that to the guards at the service entrance. The guards will confiscate it and destroy it according to protocol, so don't be worried. You can leave after that,\" Duke Whirlwind said.\nAlex looked at the paper.\nScribbles.\nAlex couldn't discern anything on the paper, and he started to panic a bit.\n'Wait, so I can understand and speak the language of this world, but I can't read it? Do I actually have to learn to read again?!' Alex thought.\nDuke Whirlwind looked at Alex's face in confusion, but he chuckled a bit later.\n\"It's written in code,\" Duke Whirlwind said. \"You can't read it.\"\n\"Oh!\" Alex shouted in relief.\nAfter releasing a sigh, Alex bowed politely to Duke Whirlwind. \"Thank you for your kindness, sir. Also, I am sorry for the damage I have done to your garden while living here. When I have money, I will repay everything.\"\nDuke Whirlwind waved dismissively. \"You can't eat and kill enough to do any form of damage to my garden. Additionally, you said you exchanged food for the Earth Fruit Hedgehog's fruits. That's usually the job of the keepers of this area. After all, the Earth Fruit Hedgehog needs to expend a lot of Mana to create its Mana Source. In a way, you actually worked for me.\"\n\"You don't need to repay me for anything,\" Duke Whirlwind said.\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Alex said.\nHowever, he now felt even guiltier.\nSure, the duke might not care about the small things, but Alex had also taken the Ice Mana Source. Additionally, without Alex, the Old Ice Octopus would still be alive.\n'I'll find out the cost of a Pure Ice Mana Source in the future and repay the duke according to its market value,' Alex thought.\n\"Then, I will see you in the future, Shang,\" Duke Whirlwind said. \"I visit the academy occasionally. I'm certain we will see each other again.\"\nAlex bowed again. \"Yes, and thank you again for your kindness. It means a lot to me, and I won't forget it. I'm looking forward to seeing you again!\"\nDuke Whirlwind nodded and started on reciting another spell.\nIt was that very long spell from earlier again.\nAfter a couple of seconds, Duke Whirlwind flew away from Alex and vanished into the mountains.\nAlex looked at the sky for a while, just imagining how it would be like to fly.\nWould he ever be able to fly?\nWould he ever reach such a level of power?\nHe wasn't sure.\nThen, Alex looked at the piece of paper in his right hand.\n\"This is my ticket to human society,\" he said to himself.\n'The God has really placed me at the perfect location. I remember that he said that there was one human in the world that reached the Fourth Realm, and Duke Whirlwind said that the most powerful physical fighter of the world was in his territory.'\n'They are probably talking about the same person.'\nAlex looked towards the east.\n'I wonder what kind of person that man is. Why did he create an academy? Is it a way to make money to fuel his own desire for more power? Is it a way to amass a loyal following of powerful people? Is it to disseminate his knowledge of becoming more powerful via a physical path to more people?'\n'Is he old? Is he young?'\nAlex thought about this person for a while. After all, this person represented the current peak of the physical path.\nEventually, Alex left and traveled to the east.\nIt only took him about an hour to find the place Duke Whirlwind had been talking about.\nBetween the mountains, Alex saw a high but narrow gate. It was barely three meters wide but over 30 meters high. However, it perfectly filled out the gap in the mountains.\n\"Halt!\"\nA voice came from the top of the gate, and Alex looked up.\nAlex saw three people with drawn bows pointed at him.\nAlex became a bit nervous, but he was pretty sure that Duke Whirlwind hadn't directed him to a death trap.\n\"Who are you?! Why are you here?!\" one of the guards shouted from a distance.\nAlex slowly extended his arm into the air to show the note.\n\"Duke Whirlwind has told me to come here! I just talked to him an hour ago, and he told me that I could leave via this service entrance!\" Alex shouted.\nThe guards squinted their eyes and looked at the note.\nA normal human wouldn't be able to read such a tiny note from a distance of 200 meters, but these guards weren't normal humans.\nThe guards talked amongst themselves for a couple of seconds.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Approach the gate at a normal pace! Don't go for your sword, or you will be riddled with holes!\" one of the guards shouted.\n\"Okay!\" Alex shouted back.\nThen, Alex walked forward, his hands still in the air.\n\"Halt!\"\nAlex stopped.\nHe was now about 30 meters away from the gate.\nSuddenly, one of the soldiers jumped down from the top of the gate.\nThe soldier fell for a couple of seconds until he hit the ground with a loud impact.\nThen, the soldier stood up like nothing had happened.\nAlex was quite impressed.\n'30 meters are quite an impressive height. I can survive such a fall, but I would need to land correctly with my legs. Still, I would at least feel a bit uncomfortable.'\nAlex knew what he was talking about. In a sense, Alex was the supreme authority when it came to jumping and falling from high places.\nAlex was pretty sure that the guy in front of him had a more powerful body than him.\nAlex could see the guard now. The guard wore simple metal armor, and he carried a sword and a shield with him.\nHis equipment didn't really look special, but Alex wouldn't underestimate a soldier.\nAlex was very good at fighting against beasts, but he hadn't fought another human in this world yet.\nAlex had fought humans in his past life, but that was in MMA matches.\nFighting with a weapon was very different.\n\"Don't make any sudden moves!\" the guard ordered as he walked closer.\n\"I only want to exit,\" Alex said.\nThe guard came closer.\n\"Lower your arm and hand me the note,\" the guard ordered.\nAlex did just that, and the guard took the note.\nThe guard brought the note to the gate.\nA tiny panel moved to the side, showing a pair of eyes with glasses on them.\nThe guard held the note to the pair of eyes.\nThe glasses started to shine in complex runes, and the eyes passed over the note.\nAfter that, the guard and the person behind the gate talked for a bit.\nSome seconds later, the guard took out a piece of flint from the side of his armor and rubbed it firmly on his metal glove.\nThe note quickly started catching fire and completely burned away in two seconds.\nThis was obviously special paper.\nThen, the guard turned around and looked at Alex.\n\"Name!\" he ordered.\n\"Shang,\" Alex answered.\n\"Full name!\"\n\"Just Shang!\"\nThe guard turned to the gate again.\n\"Open the gate. He can pass,\" he said.\nThe atmosphere relaxed as all the tension vanished.\nThe guard turned around as the gate behind him slowly lifted.\n\"Welcome to Green Wind County!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 33 - Bad Habit\nAfter the gate opened, Alex stepped through it.\nSociety!\nFinally, he was back amongst humans!\n\"Did you get a good harvest?\" the guard from earlier asked Alex with a smirk.\nAlex immediately became nervous.\nWould they confiscate his belongings?\nWhen the guards saw Alex's reaction, they laughed. Obviously, after confirming the authenticity of Alex's document, they had all relaxed.\n\"You don't need to worry. If the Duke wanted us to inspect your belongings, he would have written it down on your document,\" one of the guards said. The guard walked closer and put his hand on Alex's shoulder.\nAt least, he tried to.\nAlex stepped away from the hand out of reflex.\nAfter living in the wilderness for such a long time, Alex became careful of any physical contact.\nThe guard blinked in confusion as he saw Alex step away, and he awkwardly lowered his hand.\n\"Man, you're a suspicious one,\" the guard said with a bitter smile.\nAlex became a bit embarrassed. \"Sorry. I've been in the wilderness for six whole months. I'm not used to talking with other humans.\"\nThe guard smiled and nodded. \"That's understandable. We also have to live in the wilderness as part of our training, but we have our team with us. I can't imagine how lonely it must have been to be all alone in a forest.\"\nThe entire feeling and atmosphere the guards gave off had changed.\nThe guards had appeared stalwart, careful, and aggressive when Alex had come.\nBut now, the guards didn't feel any different than the police on Earth.\nThey simply talked to Alex casually.\n\"That's a nice sword,\" one of the guards said as he looked at Alex's sword. \"Who made that?\"\nAlex subconsciously protected his sword. \"I don't remember,\" he said.\nSurprisingly, the guard nodded understandingly. Apparently, Duke Whirlwind had written about Alex's memory loss in the document he had handed Alex.\n\"Too bad. Hey, you really don't need to be that careful. Our equipment is good enough, and if it gets out that we are trying to steal from one of the Duke's guests, our heads will roll,\" the guard said.\nAlex wasn't sure how he should respond to that.\nHe had already said sorry earlier, and saying sorry again would sound awkward.\nInstead, an awkward silence came down on the camp of guards.\n\"Let me show you where you need to go,\" another guard said, pointing towards the mountains.\n\"Yes, thank you,\" Alex said, happy that the awkwardness vanished.\n\"Have fun outside, kid,\" one of the guards said with a wave.\n\"Thanks, you too,\" Alex answered.\nHe was really unused to talking to people.\nBack on Earth, Alex had been a very extroverted person. He loved going out with his friends, and he had had no issues with crowds.\nBut after living in the wilderness for such a long time, Alex became a bit uncertain about his people skills.\nAlex's eyes subconsciously darted to the guards' weaknesses and their weapons.\nIt was like Alex was ready to break out into a fight at any moment.\nAlex and one of the guards left the camp behind as they followed a dirt road between the mountains.\nHowever, after around two minutes, the guard in front of Alex stopped, and Alex took a step back.\nThen, the guard turned around and threw Alex a concerned look. \"You really need to stop looking at other people like this,\" he said.\n\"Like what?\" Alex asked carefully.\nThe guard pointed at Alex.\n\"Like that!\" he said. \"You're following behind me in total silence. Your footsteps even copy my footsteps! Then, you constantly inspect my body all over. You don't act like a warrior, but like an assassin.\"\n\"Do you know how awkward it is to walk in front of you? Every five seconds, I need to turn around since I can't hear you, and I always think that you vanished or something. On top of that, whenever I turn around, I see how you're inspecting my body with narrowed eyes. It's like you're trying to find the best spot to kill me!\" the guard said with annoyance.\nAlex looked away from the guard with an uncomfortable expression.\nThat was exactly what he had been doing.\nOf course, Alex hadn't truly planned on attacking the guard. It was simply a reflex born out of being around nothing but enemies.\nWhen the guard saw Alex's expression, he relaxed a bit and sighed. \"Listen, we warriors can deal with that. We know how it feels to be among normal humans again after a long period of fighting. However, normal humans can't deal with something like this.\"\n\"Any normal guy you can find in a village, town, or city will think that you are a shady creep. You give off this thief or bandit vibe. Honestly, I'm fairly sure that you will find plenty of women pushing their child away from you and plenty of men that will put a hand over their sacks of gold.\"\n\"Try to get acclimated to human society again,\" the guard said.\nAlex didn't like what he was hearing, but he had to admit that the guard had a point.\nAlex had to get used to being amongst humans again.\n\"Sorry, and thank you for the advice. I'll try to work on that,\" Alex said.\n\"Let's work on that right now,\" the guard said.\nAlex lifted an eyebrow in uncertainty. \"How?\"\n\"Simple,\" the guard said as he walked to the side. \"Walk in front of me for the remainder of the way.\"\nAlex immediately became nervous.\nThis guard was probably a bit more powerful than Alex.\nIf the guard tried to attack Alex from behind, there was a high likelihood that Alex would die.\nIn Alex's mind, this was stupid.\nThe guard saw Alex's hesitation and silently shook his head.\n\"Shang, that is your name, right?\" he asked.\nAlex nodded.\n\"I've been walking in front of you this entire time. How do you think I feel?\" he asked.\nAlex was surprised by the guard's words.\n\"Imagine walking in front of a guy that copies your footsteps and constantly eyes your back like you're a piece of meat. You think that's fun?\" the guard asked.\n\"Yet, did you see me have a problem with it? No! Not every human wants to kill you.\"\n\"Listen, I'm a guard employed by Duke Whirlwind, and my colleagues saw me leave with you. Do you honestly think I would even dare to do anything against you? If I did, chances are high that the Duke would find out very quickly. What then?\"\n\"I would be executed.\"\n\"For what?\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"For a sword and some scraps of fur?\"\nSilence.\nAlex felt like he was being led into a trap.\nAlex definitely didn't want to turn his back to the guard.\nHowever, Alex's logical mind also realized that everything the guard had said was true.\nSo, in the end, even if Alex didn't want to, he still passed the guard and walked in front of him.\n\"Just continue down the road. As soon as we pass the mountains, I'll show you where to go,\" the guard said from behind Alex.\nClank. Clank. Clank.\nAlex heard the guard's footsteps behind him. Without noticing it, Alex had started to walk as silently as possible to make it easier to hear the guard's footsteps behind him.\nAlex's mind was going wild with possibilities.\nThis was far more stressful than he had thought.\nClank. Clank…\nBANG!\nAlex jumped forward and looked back.\nHe hadn't heard the latest step of the guard!\nAlex saw the guard standing a couple of meters away from him, his arms crossed in front of his chest. He was looking at Alex with a concerned look.\n\"What's up?\" he asked.\n\"You stopped walking,\" Alex said awkwardly.\n\"Yeah, humans stop from time to time,\" the guard said. \"Guess what, sometimes, we also accidentally make shorter or longer steps. Don't try to attribute bad intentions to a mere habit.\"\nAlex put his sword away again and continued walking.\n'I might actually have a problem,' Alex thought.\nClank. Clank. Clank.\nClank. Clankclank.\nAlex's hairs stood on end, and he turned his head back.\nThe guard had kicked a small pebble to the side.\nThen, the guard gestured to the path ahead with his head.\nAlex continued walking.\nIn total, they walked for nearly ten minutes.\nThis might have been the most stressful walk in Alex's life.\nWhen Alex passed the last mountain, he walked to the side and looked at the guard.\nThe guard leisurely walked forward and stopped beside Alex.\n\"See? Was that so bad?\" the guard asked.\nAlex didn't answer.\nHe only grimaced.\nMeanwhile, the guard pointed towards the distance, at the foot of another mountain.",

      "content": "Chapter 34 - Money\nThe outside world didn't look much different from the basin. It basically only had fewer trees.\nThere was still a lot of snow everywhere, and the majority of trees were conifers.\nOne difference of note was the general changes of elevation. The basin had only had mountains around it, and the inside of the basin had been rather even.\nIn contrast, the outside had far more mountainous terrain. Hills stretched across the landscape, and Alex could see some mountains.\nAlex hadn't been to Alaska on Earth, but he assumed that Alaska would look a bit like that.\nIn the distance, Alex saw a small village.\nThe village was built on the side of a hill, and he could see around 100 houses made of stone.\nObviously, it was a rather small village.\n\"That's Coldew Village. You can ask for directions to Warrior's Paradise there,\" the guard said.\n\"How did you know that I want to go to Warrior's Paradise?\" Alex asked.\n\"The Duke wrote in his letter that you wanted to join his academy. By the way,\" the guard said as he remembered something. \"You might want to stay at Coldew Village for a while and earn some money.\"\n\"Money? Why?\" Alex asked.\n\"The yearly exams for the academy have only recently finished. You either need to wait about eleven months or get some money for a special exam.\"\nAlex didn't like what he had just heard.\nThis really was bad timing.\n\"Money, huh?\" Alex said.\nThe guard laughed. \"Yep, money is always a problem. It doesn't matter how powerful you become or what job you have. You always need money,\" the guard said.\n\"How much do I need?\" Alex asked.\n\"Five gold coins,\" the guard answered.\nAlex was a bit surprised. \"That doesn't sound like a lot,\" Alex said.\nThe guard scoffed. \"100 copper coins are a silver coin. 100 silver coins are a gold coin. One average apple costs one copper coin. Do the math yourself.\"\nAlex did the math, and he took a deep breath.\nFive gold coins were equivalent to 50,000 apples!\nOne apple, on average, had cost around 20 cents on earth. So, five apples were the equivalent of a dollar.\nThis meant that Alex would have to pay around 10,000 dollars to enter the academy!\nThat was a lot of money!\n\"Why is it so expensive?\" Alex asked.\n\"Two reasons,\" the guard answered. \"First, the academy also needs money. Second, if you want the academy to hold a test for only one person, you better not be a weakling. Strong warriors can earn a lot of money rather easily. For them, getting the funds shouldn't take more than a month.\"\n\"More power means more money, and the more money you have, the less it's worth in your eyes. A weak warrior that can't earn any money will think that this is far too much money, but a strong warrior can deal with the expense,\" the guard explained.\nAlex nodded.\nThat was actually quite a smart policy.\nHowever, that didn't stop Alex from hating the fact that he had to get so much money just to join some academy.\n\"How should I go about earning money?\" Alex asked.\n\"Coldew Village doesn't have much money,\" the guard said. \"However, Coldew Village is famous for its Ice Wood. Ice Wood comes from a tree called the Dripping Cold Tree. The Dripping Cold Tree absorbs a lot of Mana and converts it to Ice Mana, which is then stored in its wood. Ice Mages need that wood for a plethora of different things.\"\n\"So,\" Alex said, \"you say I should get some of that Ice Wood and sell it at a nearby town?\"\n\"Yes,\" the guard said. \"Get a sled and a ton of Ice Wood. Transport it to Warrior's Paradise and sell it to a woodworker. That should be enough to cover your entrance fee.\"\n\"And how am I supposed to get my hand on a ton of Ice Wood?\" Alex asked.\n\"Exchange your services for resources. Coldew Village is in the wilderness, and there are plenty of beasts that make issues. Ask the mayor for any troublesome beasts and kill them. Say you want to be paid in Ice Wood, and everything will be fine,\" the guard explained.\nAlex scratched his chin in thought and nodded. \"That should work. Thanks!\" Alex said with a smile.\n\"No problem,\" the guard answered, but then, he extended his right index finger to show that he had one more thing to say.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Keep one thing in mind,\" he said. \"There are a lot of bandits around. It's okay to kill a bandit. In fact, it's even encouraged!\"\n\"Don't die an early death because you feel pity for someone that just tried to take your life,\" the guard said.\nAlex took a deep breath.\nHis death on Earth flashed through his mind.\nHe had already killed a human before, and he had certainly not enjoyed it.\nAlex became a bit nervous when he thought about killing a human, but he knew that it was a necessity.\nThis world ruled on strength alone, and such a world couldn't possibly be peaceful.\nWould Alex kill someone for more power?\nProbably.\nSo, if Alex was willing to think about a human for power, others would certainly think like that too.\n\"I will keep that in mind. Thank you again for your advice,\" Alex said.\n\"No problem. Wish you luck in your entrance exam!\" the guard said with a smile and a wave before going back to the pathway between the mountains.\nAlex watched as the guard left and then focused on the village in the distance.\n'A village, huh?' Alex thought. 'Back on Earth, such small villages are incredibly rare in very developed countries. I don't think I've ever been to such a small village before.'\nAlex took a deep breath and jumped forward.\nThe mountains were on a higher elevation than the valley below him, and the street going downward was relatively steep.\nLuckily, Alex was no longer in a thick forest.\nNow, a path was in front of him.\nAlex became faster and faster as he accelerated down the mountain.\nThe wind violently brushed against Alex's body, and Alex had never felt this free before!\nAlex could run as fast as a car! Well, not as fast as a car going full-throttle, but he was still as fast as a car that drove outside any settlements. It wasn't highway level, but still pretty fast.\nAlex looked at the village in the distance, and he could only smile.\nPower!\nSpeed!\nFreedom!\nMaybe coming to this world wasn't so bad?",

      "content": "Chapter 35 - Meeting The Village\nAlex ran towards the village. He actually didn't need to run since he had plenty of time, but Alex just couldn't control himself after arriving in an area without an overwhelming number of trees.\n'I can run so fast!' Alex thought with exhilaration.\nAs Alex ran down the hill, some birds living in cold climates flew above him. They were searching for prey, but there was not much prey during the cold.\nThe winter was slowly making way for spring, but spring wasn't completely there yet. If Alex had to put a month to the current weather, he would say it would be the end of February or the start of March.\nAlex ran for about fifteen minutes, and he arrived at the village far too early.\nIn a sense, Alex had wished to run more.\n'I can always run more later,' Alex thought with a smile.\nAs Alex came to the village, he noticed that there were no guards.\nThere were also no pedestrians.\nIn fact, there was no one.\nAlex blinked a couple of times in confusion.\n'That's weird. I was sure I saw some people walking around.'\nAlex looked around the abandoned village and thought of something.\n'Is it me?' Alex thought.\nAlex looked around the village. It was currently in the middle of the day, and all the villagers should be working.\n\"Who are you?!\" someone suddenly shouted.\nAlex looked to the front and saw a burly, middle-aged man walking past a house.\nHe had a spear and wore some simple leather armor. His hair was brown, and a long and scruffy beard adorned his face.\nAlex immediately associated that man with a smith.\nHe looked like the typical smith one would find in movies and shows.\n\"Hello, I'm… Shang,\" Alex said nervously. He had nearly wanted to say his original name again.\n\"What do you want?!\" the man shouted aggressively. \"We don't have any money, and we are protected by the Northern Wild!\"\nAlex smiled in embarrassment. \"I think you misunderstood me. I'm not here to do anything to you.\"\n\"Lies!\" the man shouted. \"You charged at our village! Speak the truth, or I will kill you myself!\"\nAlex scratched the back of his head in embarrassment. \"I ran because it felt good.\"\n\"It felt good?\" the man asked in surprise.\n\"Yes,\" Alex answered. \"I've been in a forest for the past six months, and this is the first time I'm at a place not filled with trees. Running down the mountain and feeling my new power after my trip just felt too good.\"\nThe man eyed Alex suspiciously. \"Is that why you are dressed like a thief?\" he asked coldly.\n\"Like a thief?\" Alex asked in surprise.\nThen, Alex looked down at himself.\nAlex's body was surrounded by the cloak made out of Stalker hide. Even part of his head was hidden inside the black cloak.\nAlex immediately felt like an idiot and quickly pulled his badly sewn hood down, revealing his black hair.\n\"Oh, sorry. I wasn't thinking,\" Alex said with a bitter smile. \"Honestly, I'm not here to do anything to you.\"\nThe man relaxed a bit, but he still spoke to Alex from several meters away.\n\"Then what do you want?\" he asked.\n\"I'm here to earn enough money to pay for an entrance exam in that warrior school in Warrior's Paradise,\" Alex said.\nThe man got surprised, but his eyes quickly narrowed.\n\"How old are you?\" he asked.\n\"I think I should be 15,\" Alex said. \"I didn't really count.\"\n\"You don't look 15!\" the man shouted. \"You look more like 30!\"\nAlex was taken aback by the man's words.\nThen, Alex sighed. \"Let me just take my cloak off. Maybe I look too intimidating with that cloak.\"\nThe man didn't answer and only looked at Alex warily.\nAlex quickly pulled his cloak off and threw it to the side.\nThe clothing beneath his cloak was absolutely disgusting, dirty, stinky, full of holes, and old.\nNot even beggars would wear something like that since they could find better clothing that had been thrown to the side of a street.\nThe man looked with disgust and pity at Alex. Surprisingly, his hostility lessened.\nBandits would normally wear quite good armor and good clothing. After all, their job was to rob people.\nNo bandit would wear something like that.\nAdditionally, the man noticed that Alex's body really looked like the body of a teenager, just far more muscular.\nTeenagers had different bodies from adults. This was simply because they hadn't fully gone through puberty yet.\nWhen asked, most people couldn't explain the differences, but with enough life experience, one would immediately see that Alex was a teenager, not an adult.\nIt was just a feeling.\nWhen the cloak was removed, the man also saw Alex's sword.\nAlex's sword looked weird.\nIt basically had no handguard, and the blade itself was way too straight and uniform. Swords usually went from thick to thin, thick at the hilt, thin at the front.\nYet, Alex's sword was just incredibly straight, except for the tip where the sword suddenly narrowed down into a tip.\nHowever, the man could tell that the sword was very good.\nAlex's story made a lot more sense now.\nHe truly looked like someone that had lived in the wild for a long time.\n\"Why have you lived in the wild for so long?\" the man asked.\nAlex released a sigh of relief when the man calmed down. \"To become stronger.\"\nSilence.\nThen, the man put his spear away. \"That's quite some determination,\" he said. \"Can I see your sword?\"\nAlex simply took out his sword and threw it over.\nThe sword slid on the ground, and the man looked at Alex with surprise.\nThe man walked forward and lifted the sword.\nHowever, the sword was far heavier than he had thought, and he had to put more strength into lifting it.\nHe managed to lift it with one arm, but he couldn't possibly swing it, not even with both hands.\nThe man looked at the sword and then at Alex.\n\"Why did you throw your weapon over to me?\" the man asked.\n\"To prove that I don't have any bad intentions,\" Alex said.\nThe man furrowed his brows as he felt the weight of the sword.\nHe had seen how Alex had easily thrown it over with one hand.\nIt had been like the sword weighed nothing.\n\"Would you need this sword if you had bad intentions towards the village?\" he asked slowly.\n\"No,\" Alex said with a smile.\n\"Then what worth is this display of yours?\" the man asked.\nAlex sighed in frustration and rubbed the back of his head.\n\"Hey, listen, I'm getting a bit annoyed here,\" Alex said in a relaxed manner. \"I don't want to play these stupid games. Obviously, you now know of my strength. If I wanted to do anything to your village, I wouldn't be talking with you. I would just do whatever I wanted to do.\"\nAlex was honestly getting annoyed at the constant suspicion.\nThe man looked at Alex for a bit longer.\nClank!\nHe threw the sword back with both of his hands, but it didn't reach Alex.\n\"You said you wanted to earn money?\" the man asked.\nAlex walked forward and put his sword away again.\nWhy had Alex thrown his sword towards the man without hesitation?\nOne reason was to show that he didn't intend to do anything bad to them.\nAnother reason was to show his power as softly as possible.\nThe last reason was that Alex wouldn't need a weapon against these villagers if they attacked him.\nAlex wasn't helpless without a weapon.\n\"Yes, I want to earn money,\" Alex said.\nThe man walked closer. He had already put his spear away.\nBy now, only two meters separated them.\n\"How do you intend to earn money?\" the man asked.\n\"One of the guards over there,\" Alex said as he pointed towards the Duke's garden, \"said that your village might need a warrior to take care of some beasts. He told me that you don't have much money, but he also told me that you have Ice Wood. I am supposed to offer my strength to you in exchange for Ice Wood.\"\nThe man eyed Alex with an evaluation gaze.\nThen, he looked at Alex's coat and then at Alex again.\n\"Did you kill the Pest Cat yourself?\" the man asked, pointing at the cloak.\n\"Pest Cat?\" Alex asked as he looked at his coat. \"They are called Pest Cats? I always called them Stalkers.\"\nThe man looked with a weird expression at Alex. \"They are called Pest Cats because they are all over this land. There's a lot of them, and they often hunt our livestock. No matter how many we kill, more come. That's why they are called Pest Cats.\"\n\"You can kill them?\" Alex asked in surprise.\nIn his eyes, the man didn't look that strong.\nThe man sighed. \"If we create a hunting group with about five men, we can, but someone will always die. Most of the time, a team of soldiers from the Northern Wild come here once a year to thin out the population.\"\n\"What's the Northern Wild?\" Alex asked.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The man looked weirdly at Alex.\n\"The nearest town. You're not from around here, are you?\" he asked.\n\"No,\" Alex answered. \"When was the last time they were here?\"\n\"Six months ago. They come in the fall when all the Pest Cats have finished procreating. It would be bad if two Pest Cats had offspring just a couple days after the hunt,\" the man explained.\nAlex scratched his chin.\n\"So, you're saying that I can earn some Ice Wood by killing some Pest Cats?\" Alex asked with interest.\nThe man looked at Alex.\n\"No.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 36 - Old Man\nAlex hadn't expected a no for an answer.\n\"Then why did you ask about my coat?\" he asked.\n\"To gauge your strength,\" the man said. \"So, did you take out the Pest Cat yourself?\"\nAlex nodded. \"I took out several. They are not my opponent.\"\nThis took the man by surprise.\nHe knew that Alex was strong since he was able to wield such a heavy sword in one hand, but he hadn't known how strong Alex was.\n\"They are not your opponents?\" he asked. \"What Stage are you?\"\n\"Stage?\" Alex asked, but then he remembered the Duke's words. \"I should be in the Late First Realm.\"\n\"Late Soldier Stage?!\" the man asked in shock. \"And you're 15?!\"\n\"Soldier Stage?\" Alex asked in confusion. \"I thought the First Realm was called Apprentice.\"\n\"That's for Mages only,\" the man said. \"The First Realm for warriors is the Soldier Stage. That's because nearly all soldiers are in that Stage.\"\n\"Oh, okay,\" Alex said. \"And yes, I'm at the Late Soldier Stage then.\"\nThe man looked far more surprised than Alex had assumed.\n\"Is that high?\" he asked.\n\"Are you from a noble household?\" the man asked in shock.\nAlex snorted. \"Do I look like I'm from a noble household?\" he asked.\nThe man looked at Alex.\n\"So, is it strong?\" Alex asked.\n\"Warriors in the Late Soldier Stage are generally considered elite warriors,\" the man answered. \"They worked for years for their power.\"\n\"Elite soldiers?\" Alex asked in surprise, \"but the guards I met at that mountain were all more powerful than me.\"\n\"You can't compare normal soldiers to the soldiers working directly under the Duke,\" the man said. \"The men under the Duke are all in the General Stage. That's the equivalent to the Adept Realm for Mages.\"\n\"Oh,\" Alex commented. \"By the way, how do you know all these things?\"\n\"When I was young, I worked as a smith in Warrior's Paradise,\" the man said.\n'Knew it!' Alex thought. The guy just looked far too much like a smith.\n\"Back to the topic,\" the man said. \"You said that Pest Cats are not your opponents, right?\"\nAlex nodded.\n\"Could you elaborate on your power? How would the fight go down?\"\nAlex answered immediately. \"One strike, one kill,\" Alex said. \"As long as they don't jump me from several different angles, I can take out a group of them with ease.\"\nAlex had truly transformed in the last six months.\nWhen he had just arrived, one Pest Cat had already nearly spelled his doom. If he hadn't been lucky, the Pest Cat would have killed him.\nThen, Alex had been able to fight one equally.\nThen, Alex found it easy to kill one of them.\nAnd after the incident with the Ice Bear and the subsequent strengthening with the fruits, the Pest Cats were no longer a threat.\nIn fact, Alex could break a Pest Cat's neck with a single punch.\nHis body was far stronger than a Pest Cat's body.\nWhen the man heard of Alex's power, he was taken aback once again.\nThe man quickly fell into thought.\n\"If you are truly that powerful, we might have a lucrative job for you,\" the man said.\nWhen Alex heard that, he immediately perked up.\n\"A job? What job?\" he asked.\nThe man turned around and gestured towards the middle of the village.\n\"Follow me. You should speak with the Elder,\" he said.\n\"Okay,\" Alex said with a smile as he followed behind the man.\nAs Alex walked through the village, he could see curious eyes glancing at him through the windows of the houses.\nThe villagers were still wary of him.\nThey probably had bad experiences with strangers.\nNot everyone was as courageous as the old smith.\nAfter a minute, the two of them arrived in front of a normal house.\nIt didn't look any different from any other house in the city.\nJust like every other house, it was made out of grey stone.\nThe man knocked a couple of times on the door. \"Elder, I think we have someone that can take on the Ice Wood Pest.\"\n'Ice Wood Pest?' Alex repeated in his head.\nAfter some seconds, the door opened, and an old man looked at Alex.\nThe man was probably in his fifties or sixties, but he looked like he was in his seventies.\nHis frame was small, and he seemed to not have much strength in his body anymore. The man also used a long cane in order to stand relatively straight.\nHowever, when Alex saw the old man, he became a bit surprised.\nA bit of Mana was swirling around the old man!\nWas he a Mage?\nOf course, the old man couldn't be compared to Duke Whirlwind. When put into comparison, the old man felt like an old weed while Duke Whirlwind felt like a towering, ancient oak.\nDuke Whirlwind had pulled in an incredible amount of Mana like a whirlpool, while this old man only pulled in a bit of Mana, one teaspoon at a time.\nThe gap was just too vast.\n\"You're a Mage?\" Alex asked.\nThe old smith was surprised by Alex's words, but the eyes of the old man didn't react.\nIt was like he had expected that.\nThe old man looked at Alex, and he could see that Alex was pulling in quite a bit of Mana, even more than the old man himself.\n\"Are you confident?\" the old man asked Alex.\n\"No,\" Alex answered.\nThe old smith was surprised by Alex's answer.\nThe old man only smiled a bit.\n\"Smart,\" he said. \"Come in.\"\n'How could I be confident in defeating an enemy I don't even know?' Alex thought.\nThe old smith waited outside while Alex entered the old man's house.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The house was very simple and quaint. It looked like a cozy house of a villager.\nThe old man gestured to a chair, and Alex sat down.\nThe old man got some water from a bucket and warmed it over the fire, and while the water was warming, the old man sat down in front of Alex.\n\"Have you fought a High-Rank Beast before?\" the man asked.\nAlex thought back to the Ice Spear Bear and nodded. According to Duke Whirlwind, that Ice Spear Bear had been a High-Rank Beast. Back then, Alex had probably been in the Mid Soldier Stage, which meant that Alex had basically jumped a Small Stage or Small Realm.\n\"Did you win?\" the old man asked.\n\"I'm still alive, aren't I?\" Alex asked.\n\"You could have fled.\"\n\"I didn't,\" Alex answered.\n\"So, did you win?\" the old man asked again.\n\"Yes, I won,\" Alex answered.\nThe old man nodded.\n\"Would you be willing to fight another one?\" the old man asked.\nAlex immediately nodded.\n\"I'm warning you. This one isn't easy to deal with,\" the old man said.\nAlex looked with a concerned look at the old man. \"What separates this one from other High-Rank Beasts?\"\n\"It's the descendant of a beast of the Second Realm,\" the man said. \"This means that this beast can use its Elemental Affinity. In essence, it can create rudimentary spells.\"\nSilence.\nThe man was a bit surprised when he saw Alex's expression.\nAlex looked at the old man like he was waiting for more info.\nWhen Alex saw that the old man had stopped talking, he raised an eyebrow in confusion. \"Can't all High-Rank Beasts do that?\" he asked.\nThe man was surprised by Alex's question. \"No, they can't. Only the descendants from Beasts in the Second Realm can use their Element in the First Realm.\"\n\"Oh, okay,\" Alex answered like it was no big deal.\nThe old man was a bit confused by Alex's lack of reaction.\nHe had expected that Alex would reconsider after hearing about his target.\nBeasts that could use their Elements in the First Realm were on the rare side, and they couldn't be compared to Beasts that reached maturity in the First Realm.\nMeanwhile, Alex was confused why the old man made such a big deal out of that.\nBasically all of Alex's past opponents, except for the Pest Cats, had had some form of Elemental Attack.\nWas this supposed to be rare?\n\"Young man, if I may ask, what kind of High-Rank Beast have you fought?\" the old man asked.\n\"A High-Rank Ice Spear Bear,\" Alex answered.\nSilence.\nThe man seemingly froze.",

      "content": "Chapter 37 - Frozen Lake Stag\nA majestic stag slowly walked through an icy forest. The trees around it had a blue sheen, and some of their needles had seemingly transformed into icicles.\nThe Stag's body was only 1.5 meters high, making it only a bit taller than a normal stag. However, its antlers were majestic beyond compare. The antlers were a deep blue, and white veins seemed to travel through them, releasing a blue glow periodically.\nThe antlers stretched upward and to the side like a tree, making one believe that this Stag was some sort of envoy sent by nature.\nWhenever the Stag passed an icy tree, the blue color of the trees slowly subsided until the trees no longer shone in any color, and after that, they simply looked like normal, almost lifeless trees made of ice.\nThe Stag absorbed the Ice Mana in the Ice Wood Trees as it passed them. The Ice Mana in the trees acted as the Stag's sustenance and energy.\nHumans weren't afraid of this Stag.\nWhy?\nBecause this was a peaceful beast.\nIt was one of the few beasts that didn't consume meat.\nOne of the few?\nBut weren't there many herbivores?\nWell, one had to differentiate between animals and beasts.\nBeasts were animals that took their first step towards power. Beasts were the animals that managed to come into contact with the Mana in the atmosphere.\nMeanwhile, animals were just animals.\nAs beasts became more powerful, their diet slowly transitioned into one mainly made of meat. The reason for that was that there were not as many plants that came into contact with Mana.\nYes, the Ice Wood Trees were one of these kinds of plants, but the Ice Wood Trees were not powerful. A beast in the First Realm could become more powerful by consuming them, but they would be useless for beasts in the Second Realm.\nThis Stag would also only consume these trees while still being in the First Stage.\nAs soon as it became an adult, it would change its diet to water beasts.\nThis Stag was the very beast that the Elder had asked Alex to kill.\nIt didn't injure or endanger the villagers, but it consumed all the Ice Mana in the Ice Wood Trees, making them nearly worthless.\nSo, while the Stag didn't directly threaten the villagers, it was essentially softly pushing them into stagnation and poverty just by existing.\n'That's it!' Alex thought as he narrowed his eyes.\nIn the distance, Alex saw the Stag consuming the Ice Mana of the Ice Wood Trees.\n'That should be the Frozen Lake Stag,' Alex thought.\nAlex watched the Stag for a while.\nThe majestic and peaceful gait of the Frozen Lake Stag gave the surrounding forest a kind of peaceful and tranquil feeling.\nIt was almost like this place was a holy ground for nature.\n'Well, sucks for you. I need money,' Alex thought.\nAlex inspected the Stag's antlers closer, and a frown spread over Alex's face.\n'The Elder's fears have proven to be true.'\nAlex remembered the words the Elder had spoken to him.\n\"If the Frozen Lake Stag's antlers pulsate with a white aura, it is close to becoming a beast of the Second Realm. This would essentially make it a Peak-Grade beast. We haven't seen the Frozen Lake Stag in a while, so we're not sure if it's still a High-Grade beast.\"\nAlex looked at the white aura emanating from the Frozen Lake Stag's antlers.\n'I never fought a Peak-Grade beast before,' Alex thought. 'However, I'm actually glad that it became stronger. The God said that I should push myself, and I'm certain that the God knows more about becoming stronger than me. If he says that I should continually push myself, I should probably do so.'\n'So, this Frozen Lake Stag came at just the right time.'\nWould the Elder still want Alex to kill the Frozen Lake Stag if he knew that it was about to change its diet?\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Yes!\nWhy?\nBecause the Frozen Lake Stag needed an incredible amount of Ice Mana to reach the Second Realm, and it was gathering this Ice Mana right now.\nIt wouldn't stop consuming Ice Wood Trees until a big part of this forest was without Ice Mana.\nAlex checked his equipment.\nHis coat was on him.\nHis left arm was numb due to its low temperature.\nHis sword was in his right hand.\nEverything was ready.\nAlex took a deep breath to ready himself, and then…\nBANG!\nAlex exploded forward with his full speed!\nThe Frozen Lake Stag turned towards the explosive sound and saw Alex charging at it. As soon as it saw Alex, it turned away and ran into the distance.\nIts speed was pretty fast, but its gigantic antlers made it difficult for the Frozen Lake Stag to navigate. It was powerful enough to ram through thick branches, but every branch destroyed by its antlers would slow it down a bit.\nBecause of that, Alex was slowly gaining ground, even though his body was weaker than the Frozen Lake Stag's body.\nWas it fleeing?\nNo!\nIt was fighting!\nAlex immediately jumped to the side as he felt Ice Mana gather below him.\nSHING!\nAn ice spire shot out of the ground, and Alex had just barely evaded it!\nThis was how the Frozen Lake Stag fought. It transferred its Ice Mana into the ground and made it explode into mighty ice spires.\nThis was also how it would kill water beasts in the future. A water beast that came close to the shore would suddenly be penetrated by a gigantic ice spire, which would then keep the beast above the water.\nThe sudden appearance of the ice spire had slowed Alex, but he had expected it. After all, the Elder wouldn't send Alex blind into the fight.\nAs the Frozen Lake Stag galloped through the forest, the Ice Mana of the surrounding trees entered its antlers, refilling its Mana Storage.\nAlex was fighting the Frozen Lake Stag in its most favorable territory.\nAs long as there were Ice Wood Trees, it wouldn't run out of Ice Mana.\nSHING! SHING!\nAnother two ice spires shot out of the ground, and Alex managed to sidestep them.\nAlex could always feel the Ice Mana arrive at the ground, which allowed him to evade.\nWhen the Frozen Lake Stag saw that its attacks couldn't hit Alex, it increased the intensity of the attacks. Even more, the deployment of its attacks became smarter.\nIt became harder and harder for Alex to evade the icicles until he had to stop completely.\nSHING!\nAn ice spire stopped just ten centimeters in front of Alex's face. This ice spire would have been inside his head if he had stopped only a bit later.\nHowever, Alex still jumped to the side.\nSHING!\nThe ice spire in front of Alex's face suddenly expanded one more time, but Alex had evaded to the side.\nThe Frozen Lake Stag had control over its ice spires, even if they had already been deployed. It simply had to send another pulse of Ice Mana towards them.\nSHING! SHING! SHING!\nAnother barrage of ice spires shot at Alex, but he managed to barely evade them.\nThe barrage of attacks continued, and Alex was stuck evading inside a constricting mass of ice spires.\nThe ice spires had shot out of the ground in many different angles, essentially creating a chaotic field filled with spires.\nAlex kept an eye on the Frozen Lake Stag.\nThe Frozen Lake Stag had stopped running away and turned. It was circling Alex from about ten meters away as it deployed its ice spires.\nAlex was stuck inside the ever-growing mass of Ice Spires, and he couldn't escape. He had already tried to destroy the ice spires with his sword, but it proved to be surprisingly hard. Whenever Alex's sword hit an ice spire, it would break into two, but Alex's entire body shook due to the force.\nCutting through the ice spires was not easy and required a lot of force.\nThat short moment of pause could spell Alex's doom, which was why he stopped cutting the ice spires.\nAfter the Frozen Lake Stag had fully circled Alex once, it suddenly stopped and lifted both of its front legs.\nAt the same time, Alex felt that everything in a ten-meter radius around him suddenly glowed with a crazy amount of Ice Mana.\nThe Frozen Lake Stag had created over thirty ice spires that would shoot at Alex simultaneously!\nEvery spot around him would be filled with ice spires in a second!",

      "content": "Chapter 38 - Antlers\nAlex jumped.\nSHING! SHING! SHING!\nEverything below Alex was reduced into a mess of ice spires, all stretching into the middle of the circle from ten meters away.\nAlex had jumped with his full power, and he had managed to jump forward with a height of five meters.\nThis was far beyond what a normal human could do.\nThe Frozen Lake Stag didn't panic when it saw that Alex managed to escape its attack.\nInstead, it calmly infused one of the ice spires with more Ice Mana.\nThe spire began glowing and shot at Alex.\nAlex was currently in the air, and he couldn't evade.\nIt was stupid to jump into the air when one was fighting someone with ranged attacks.\nOnly an idiot would do that.\nWas Alex an idiot?\nNo.\nAlex stretched his left arm towards the ground.\nBANG!\nA violent wind came out of Alex's left palm. The wind wasn't colder than the surroundings, but Alex didn't use the ability of his left arm because of the cold effect.\nNo, he was using it for the pushback!\nA thick ice spire passed just below Alex, destroying a couple of fingers in the process.\nHowever, Alex was used to worse pain.\nAlex pushed himself over the ice spire until he started falling down on its opposite side.\nAlex squatted on the ice spire's side.\nThen, he pushed himself forward with all his power.\nBANG!\nThe ice spire shook under the power, but Alex had seen how hard these things were. He was sure that it wouldn't break.\nAnd sure enough, the ice spire only shook. It didn't break.\nThe force of Alex's push shot him towards the Frozen Lake Stag like a cannonball!\nAlex reached the Frozen Lake Stag before it could deploy another ice spire or run away.\nAlex lifted his sword and slashed down.\nSHING!\nAlex's sword cut through the Frozen Lake Stag's torso but was stopped somewhere in the middle.\nThe Frozen Lake Stag shouted in pain, and more Ice Mana gathered around it on the ground.\nAlex pulled out his mangled hand and pointed it at the Frozen Lake Stag's head.\nBANG!\nAlex's left arm began smoking as an impossibly cold wind shot out of Alex's left hand.\nAt the same time, Alex used the force of the wind to push himself away from the Frozen Lake Stag.\nYet, something unexpected happened.\nAlex had expected the Frozen Lake Stag's head to freeze over, but the cold wind was absorbed by its antlers!\nThe antlers lit up with bright white light, and the intensity of the Ice Mana around it increased by several times!\nThe spots of Ice Mana just half a meter away from the Frozen Lake Stag's body expanded until they even reached the ground below it.\nBANG!\nA wall of ice appeared just in front of Alex, but luckily, only his sword had been in the path of these absolutely massive ice spires!\nAlex felt his sword being torn out of his hand, and at the same time, Alex felt like he had heard a painful cry.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ And the Frozen Lake Stag?\nThe scene was gruesome.\nThe Frozen Lake Stag was impaled on gigantic ice spires, its mangled body hanging down from ten meters above the ground.\nIts cold blood ran down the ice spires and immediately froze, creating red icicles.\nThe scene was as brutal as it was bizarrely beautiful.\nThe Frozen Lake Stag obviously hadn't survived its own attack. Originally, it had only wanted to destroy the area around it to force Alex to retreat, but the uncontrollable growth of its spires had spelled its doom.\nAlex was captivated by the scene for one second before an overwhelming burning sensation came from his left arm.\nAlex grunted and rubbed his left arm across the ice spires in the surroundings to cool it down.\nHe had unleashed a severely cold wind in his last attack, and his left arm was paying the price.\nAfter a while of cooling down, Alex looked around the area to find his sword. He had remembered in which direction it flew, but he couldn't see it immediately.\nAlex felt nervous without his sword, and the first thing he wanted to do was to find it.\nAlex ran into the distance and searched for some seconds, but some kind of connection made him look up.\nAlex spotted his sword hanging on the branches of a tree, and he quickly retrieved it with a jump.\nHowever, when Alex inspected his sword, shock spread across his face.\nThere was a crack!\nThe ice spire had hit Alex's sword on its side, and the force had created a crack on it!\nAlex looked at the sword with a bitter expression.\nThe God had said that this sword would grow alongside him. He only had to feed it powerful ore.\n'Has my power already reached a level that makes my weapon my weakness?' Alex thought.\nAlex still remembered how easily his sword had killed the Pest Cat, or Stalker, which had assaulted Alex on his first day in this world.\nBack then, Alex would have died if his sword hadn't been so incredibly powerful.\nBut now, Alex's sword had been damaged by one of his enemies.\n'My opponents will only become more powerful from here on out. This means that I have to upgrade my sword quickly. Otherwise, my sword will break as soon as it comes into contact with any attack.'\nAlex stared at the crack in his sword for some time and put it away.\n'Not right now,' Alex thought.\nAlex walked back to the Frozen Lake Stag and looked at it for a bit.\nThe corpse had been separated into many different parts, and its head hung down from one of the ice spires.\nAlex grimaced when he saw the scene. However, he grimaced for a different reason than one might expect.\n'Seems like I can't sell that,' Alex thought. Then, he looked at the head and the antlers. 'Luckily, its antlers are in one piece. I bet they are worth quite a bit.'\nAlex took out his sword. 'Sorry, you have to go through a bit more stress.'\nAlex stabbed his sword into one of the ice spires and used it as a tool to climb the small wall of icicles.\nHis sword didn't make any noise during that process.\nAfter a bit of climbing, Alex reached the hanging head.\nAlex stepped onto his sword and grabbed the antlers. He wanted to pull the head and antlers off.\n\"Fuck!\"\nAlex immediately shouted in pain as soon as his hands touched the antlers.\nAlex's right hand was nearly completely frozen over!\nLuckily, Alex had reacted fast enough, and only the surface froze.\nAlex activated his Ice Blast again to warm his left arm and then rubbed his cold and hot hands together.\nAfter a while, Alex's right hand recovered, but it was still in quite a bit of pain.\nYet, as Alex was calming down, he realized something.\n'My left hand didn't get frozen,' Alex thought as he looked at it.\n'I also didn't feel any pain from it.'\nAlex looked at the antlers again.\n'Worst case scenario, I'll just heat it again.'\nAlex touched the antlers with his left hand, and, sure enough, he felt nothing.\nAlex used his right hand to throw the sword to the ground and hung from the corpse's head with his left hand.\nThen, Alex pulled himself upward and let himself fall a bit to create enough force to separate the head from the body. The head was barely hanging on by a couple of threads of skin due to the ice spires.\nA comical scene of Alex swinging on the hanging antlers of a nearly decapitated head took place.\n\"Come on! You can't be that hard!\"\nThe sound of tearing flesh and skin could be heard as the head slowly separated, and soon enough, the entire head separated from the body.\nBANG!\nAlex fell to the ground while carrying the head by its antlers.\nA ten-meter-fall was nothing to him.\nAlex used his right hand to clean some of his clothes of the blood that had fallen on him during his mission.\nHowever, Alex quickly became surprised as he looked at his right arm.\n'Wasn't this supposed to hurt?' Alex thought.\nAlex was surprised when he saw his right hand.\nIt was fully healed!\n'Now that I think about it, my left hand also feels pretty good now,' Alex thought as he looked at his left arm.\nThen, Alex noticed something.\nWas the glow of the antlers growing weaker?\nAlso, was his body getting hotter?\n\"Oh, fuck!\"\nAlex immediately dropped the antlers, but it was too late.\nHis left hand had absorbed a ton of Ice Mana and had converted it to regular Mana, which now filled his body.\nAlex was close to exploding.\nAlex had to do one attempted suicide of training, at least!\nOtherwise, he would explode!\nAlex quickly looked around in panic.\nNo trees were high enough for him to get heavily injured!\n\"Fuck! Fuck!\" Alex shouted.\nFear took hold of Alex.\n\"It can't be that hard to kill myself!\" he shouted.\nThen, Alex noticed the gigantic ice spires.\nAnd then, he remembered how hard it had been to cut them with his sword.\nAlex gritted his teeth, ran into the distance, turned around, went to his knees, and assumed a sprinter's position.\nThen, Alex shot with all of his power at the ice spires!",

      "content": "Chapter 39 - Pity\nAlex slowly stepped out of the forest, dragging a severed head behind him.\nThe Frozen Lake Stag's antlers had lost all their color by now.\nObviously, Alex's masochistic and power-hungry side couldn't let go of so much Mana.\nAlex slowly stepped towards the village, a couple hundred meters away. Right now, Alex could finally see the villagers doing their business. They were tending to some farms while others cooked on the streets for the entire village.\nAlex watched the village from a distance.\n'Everyone is working together. Some people are tending to the crops. Some are cooking for everyone. Some are out gathering Ice Wood.'\n'I've never seen anything like that on Earth. Sure, I've seen scenes like that in documentaries and movies, but not in real life.'\nAlex silently watched the village.\n'It has a kind of purity and innocence to it.'\nAfter a bit, a boy noticed Alex. After looking at Alex with wide eyes, he walked up to a grown woman and pointed at Alex while pulling on her skirt.\nThe woman looked at Alex, and her eyes widened.\n'Great,' Alex thought. 'Guess the villagers will all leave again.'\nHowever, surprisingly, the villagers didn't retreat. Instead, they all called each other and pointed towards Alex, or, more accurately, towards the head of the Frozen Lake Stag.\nAlex could see some shock and surprise in their eyes.\n'Well, at least they're not scared anymore,' Alex thought. 'Might as well give them a display.'\nAlex lifted the head and held it above himself.\nThe villagers continued to look at Alex while talking in hushed voices.\nAfter a couple of seconds, Alex felt a bit awkward and lowered the head.\n'Weren't they supposed to break out into a cheer or something?' Alex thought awkwardly.\nAlex released a sigh.\n'Well, real life doesn't work like that, I guess. They're probably all just happy and surprised. Who would expect a huge group of adults to loudly break out into a cheer?'\nAlex continued walking towards the village, and the villagers didn't retreat.\nWhen Alex came close to them, some of them walked up to him.\n\"Well done, young man!\" one of the men said with a bright smile. \"That beast has been a problem for a long time!\"\n\"Yes, thank you for taking care of it,\" another man said with a respectful nod.\nSeveral villagers gave their thanks, and Alex nodded back with a smile.\n\"No problem,\" Alex answered. \"Where's the Elder?\"\n\"I'm right here,\" the Elder said as he pushed himself through the gathered crowd.\nAlex nodded at the Elder. \"As you've seen, the Frozen Lake Stag has been dealt with.\"\nThe Elder looked at the head and nodded. \"Good job. I knew that the Frozen Lake Stag wouldn't be a problem for you. After all, you already took down a High-Grade Ice Spear Bear. The Ice Spear Bear has an equally powerful ranged attack, but it also isn't helpless as soon as you get close to it.\"\n\"However, I also have to say that I was a bit worried for you. I hadn't expected you to be on the hunt for over a day.\"\nAlex smiled bitterly. \"Well, something came up that I had to deal with,\" Alex explained. \"However, the fight definitely wasn't easy. The Frozen Lake Stag had already reached the Peak-Grade.\"\nThe Elder's eyes widened in surprise.\nThen, he looked at the head in Alex's hand and frowned.\n\"Then, why is there no white glow coming from its antlers?\" he asked.\n\"That's the thing I had to take care of,\" Alex said. \"My body accidentally absorbed the Ice Mana.\"\nThe Elder's eyes widened in horror.\nThen, he quickly looked at the other villagers and pulled Alex away with his hand.\nAlex had almost attacked the Elder out of instinct when he touched Alex, but Alex managed to restrain himself.\nThe Elder pulled Alex into his house and closed the door.\nThen, he released a deep sigh.\n\"Young man, you can't just tell people your affinity,\" the Elder said in a hushed tone. \"There are ways to take advantage of someone's affinity. If an enemy knows about your affinity, they can use various gadgets to influence your Mana to hurt you!\"\nAlex blinked in surprise, but the scene of the Frozen Lake Stag getting impaled by its own ability appeared in his mind.\nWhat if someone shot a lot of pure Ice Mana at Alex?\nHis left arm would absorb all the Ice Mana and fill his body.\nSure, Alex would be able to quickly recover from any injury, but what if he wasn't injured?\nWouldn't the additional Mana force him to injure himself at this very moment?\nWhat if the Frozen Lake Stag had filled Alex with Ice Mana while running away and not attacking?\nThe Frozen Lake Stag wouldn't injure Alex, which would force Alex to injure himself.\nYet, when Alex injured himself, the Frozen Lake Stag would have gotten a perfect opportunity to finish Alex. After all, Alex could recover from heavy injuries in such a state, but it wasn't instantaneous.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ A half-dead Alex couldn't evade something like those Ice Spires.\nWhat if a group of bandits threw some kind of bomb filled with Ice Mana at Alex?\nAlex would either explode or need to hurt himself severely.\nThis would give them a perfect opportunity to finish him!\nAlex immediately narrowed his eyes as he realized all of these things.\nMany warriors and Mages wouldn't have come up with all of these scenarios in an instant, but Alex had gathered enough battle experience to come up with these schemes immediately.\nAlex didn't know it yet, but his experience with battle was vastly superior to nearly every other warrior in the Soldier Stage.\n\"Thank you for telling me, Elder,\" Alex said with a thankful nod.\nThe Elder nodded solemnly. It was good that the young man realized the weight of his words.\nThe Elder had seen too many young geniuses die to their own inexperience.\n\"Now, tell me how you dealt with the surplus of Mana? A Mana Overload is usually a death sentence,\" the Elder said.\nAlex looked at the Elder neutrally.\n\"I nearly killed myself several times,\" Alex said.\nThe Elder's eyes widened in shock.\nFor a while, the Elder didn't answer.\nThen, the Elder released a deep sigh.\nAfter Alex's words, the Elder's eyes had changed.\nBefore these words, the Elder had looked at Alex as a talented, friendly youngster. Alex was very talented in the Elder's mind, and the Elder knew that Alex would go far. Alex had also offered to help the villagers instead of just directly forcing them to hand their supplies over.\nBut now, the Elder realized how naïve he had been.\nWhy naïve?\nWell, how did a genius become a genius?\nBeing a genius didn't only mean having a strong body, powerful techniques, or powerful equipment.\nA genius also needed a stalwart mindset.\nTheir will had to be unbreakable.\nA talented youngster that didn't work would only reach mediocrity.\nYet, a genius would go very far.\nWhy?\nBecause they had a solid mindset, an iron will, and discipline.\nWhere did these things come from?\nExperiences.\nMostly bad ones.\nEveryone knew how they could overcome a Mana Overload theoretically.\nYet, how many people could put that method into practice?\nHow many people had the determination to destroy their bones and organs?\nNearly no one.\nSome of them could jump over their shadow once, but as soon as they recovered from their first experience, they would be petrified with terror.\nThe pain wasn't the bad thing about nearly dying.\nIt was the fear and terror.\nSo, while some of the powerful warriors managed to severely injure themselves once, only a select few would be able to do it a second time.\nThe second time was far harder to overcome than the first time.\nThis was why the Elder had realized that he had been naïve.\nThe Elder knew that this young man was a genius, but he had overlooked the reason for why this young man was a genius.\nThe eyes of the Elder changed to pity.\nWhat had this young man gone through to create such determination?\nHe had done something which would make nearly all grown men cry in fear.\nEven more, the way this young man had phrased it had been neutral.\nIt almost sounded it was only natural to do something like that.\nMeanwhile, Alex felt a bit awkward.\nThe Elder was looking at him with these weird eyes and wasn't speaking.\nAlex had no idea what the Elder was thinking about.",

      "content": "Chapter 40 - Affinity?\n\"So, can I get my payment now?\" Alex asked after several seconds of silence.\nThe Elder recovered and sighed.\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"I'll make arrangements for your payment right now.\"\nThe Elder walked out of the house while Alex sat down and waited.\nThe pleasant smell of the room made Alex's mind relax, and before he noticed it, the Elder had already returned.\n\"The Ice Wood and a sled wagon will be ready shortly,\" the Elder said.\n\"Sled wagon?\" Alex asked in confusion.\nThe Elder nodded. \"A sled wagon is the best method to transport goods in this region. It's a sled that can be outfitted with four wheels when necessary. That allows you to transport things in the snow and on the ground.\"\n\"Oh,\" Alex said with some wonder.\nThat sounded like a practical vehicle.\nAlex wondered why he had never heard of something like that on Earth.\n\"Thanks,\" Alex added after thinking about the sled wagon for a bit, \"but why does it need wheels? Is Warrior's Paradise in a different climate?\"\nThe Elder nodded. \"We are in the Ice Wyvern Zone. Warrior's Paradise is in the Storm Eagle Zone,\" the Elder explained.\n\"Ice Wyvern Zone? Storm Eagle Zone?\" Alex asked. \"Why are the zones named after beasts?\"\nThe Elder was taken aback by Alex's question.\n\"Because of the Ice Wyvern and the Storm Eagle,\" the Elder explained with a weird tone. It was like Alex had asked a stupid question.\n\"I've never heard of these two beasts,\" Alex said. \"Why are the Zones named after them? Are they in the Zones?\"\nThe Elder lifted an eyebrow in skepticism as he looked at Alex.\nWas this young man joking with him?\nHowever, Alex appeared genuinely curious about these two godly beasts.\n\"Powerful beasts dictate the climate,\" the Elder explained slowly. \"The Ice Wyvern is an unfathomably powerful beast with an Ice Affinity. Its Ice Mana stretches over vast distances, lowering the temperature of the landscape.\"\nAlex's eyes widened in surprise.\n\"Beasts can do that?\" Alex asked in shock.\n\"Yes,\" the Elder said slowly, feeling weird about answering such a question. \"Even children know about that.\"\nAlex felt a bit weird about that comment. So, he decided to tell the Elder about his supposed memory issue.\nThe Elder understood and gave his condolences and some encouraging words after hearing about Alex's issue.\nThis young man had obviously gone through a lot.\n\"So, why are these beasts still alive?\" Alex asked. \"Are all the humans too weak to take care of them?\"\n\"No,\" the Elder said. \"There are humans even more powerful than these godly beasts, but these godly beasts are protected by them. These godly beasts transform Natural Mana into Elemental Mana. Elemental Mana is necessary for Mages to become more powerful. Even more, us common people have already adapted our lifestyle to these climates.\"\n\"If the godly beasts die, the entire climate will change. Our lifestyle is adapted to the climate, and if it undergoes a severe change, everything will break down, and many people will die,\" the Elder explained.\nAlex nodded in wonder.\nHe had thought that he was somewhere in the north due to all the snow, but it actually turned out that there was simply a very powerful beast somewhere in the area.\nThis was truly a very different world from Earth.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"What about the Storm Eagle Zone?\" Alex asked.\n\"The Storm Eagle is a godly beast with a Wind Affinity. It absorbs Natural Mana and converts it to Wind Mana, which generates many heavy storms. Us common folk mainly avoid such zones due to the natural destruction happening constantly, but the Wind Mages and warriors love it.\"\n\"The Storm Eagle Zone is filled with canyons and mountains, creating an environment with a lot of uneven ground. It's difficult to create villages and towns in craters, canyons, and mountains, which means more space for beasts. The many brutal beasts living in such an environment help the young warriors to gain battle experience, which is one of the main reasons for why the academy is in that Zone.\"\n\"The other reason is that the Duke's castle is also in that Zone. Duke Whirlwind is a High Mage with a Wind Affinity. His family and most of his Mages have a Wind Affinity, which makes this the perfect place for them,\" the Elder explained.\nAlex nodded along with curiosity.\nThe entire world had gained more wonder!\nThe climate wasn't dictated by the planet but by the mighty beasts.\nThis opened so many possibilities for different climates and territories!\nThe Pest Cats probably had a Darkness Affinity. What would the climate under a godly beast with a Darkness Affinity look like?\nWould it be constantly dark?\nWhat about a godly beast with a Water Affinity? Would that just be an ocean?\nWould a godly beast with a Fire Affinity create a volcano or a desert?\nThere was so much to explore!\n\"Now that I think about it, it's actually logical that you would have an Ice Affinity,\" the Elder said. \"You have been born into a Zone filled with Ice Mana. Many of our children have an Ice Affinity.\"\nThis gave Alex a thought.\n\"I have a question,\" he said.\n\"Yes?\" the Elder asked.\n\"When Ice Mages use their powers, do their bodies heat up?\" Alex asked.\nThe Elder looked at Alex like he had just said something stupid.\n\"No, of course not. We are simply releasing the Ice Mana. Why would that make us hot? Elemental Mana can affect the temperature, but the temperature doesn't immediately shoot to the opposite end when the Elemental Mana vanishes.\"\n\"For example, if you fill something with Ice Mana, it will cool down very quickly. After it has cooled down, when you pull all the Ice Mana out of it, it is still cold. However, it will warm up with time since there's nothing left that cools it.\"\n\"If you want to heat up something filled with Ice Mana immediately, the best method would be to replace the Ice Mana with Fire Mana,\" the Elder explained.\nAlex listened to these words with deep interest.\nHis eyes appeared innocent, but deep inside, Alex was in deep thought.\n'The same principle should apply to my Ice Blast,' Alex thought. 'The concepts of how an Ice Mage unleashes their power shouldn't be different to how a warrior with an Ice Affinity would unleash their power.'\n'In short, using my Ice Blast shouldn't result in my left arm heating up.'\nAlex wanted to frown, but he kept his expression under control. He knew that the Elder was not an enemy, but the Elder had just warned Alex about revealing his Affinity.\nIt was best to immediately put these teachings to use.\n'So, do I actually have an Ice Affinity?'\nAlex remembered that the God had said that Alex would get a very special Affinity and that Alex could maybe use it in the future.\nAlex had been sent to an ice region. The God wouldn't have said maybe if Alex had an Ice Affinity.\n'Judging by how my Ice Blast got absorbed by the Frozen Lake Stag, I'm certain that I'm not unleashing a simple cold wind, but a blast of pure Ice Mana.'\n'Actually, now that I think about it, I don't think I actually have Ice Mana in my body. I can use my Ice Blast without actually using any Mana. I can even use it indefinitely, as long as my arm stays cold.'\n'Does this mean that whenever I use my Ice Blast, my arm gets filled with Fire Mana? Why else would it heat up?'\n'Is it some kind of energy splitting or something?'\n'However, I can feel Ice Mana, and that also only started occurring after I absorbed the Pure Ice Mana Source. I didn't feel the Earth Mana from the Pure Earth Mana Source back when the hedgehog wanted to reward me. I also wasn't able to absorb the Pure Earth Mana Source.'\n'So, I can feel Ice Mana as if I had an Ice Affinity, but I don't have an Ice Affinity. Yet, my Affinity is somehow related to ice. On top of that, my Affinity is not related to earth. Lastly, my Affinity might be related to fire, but I can't be sure yet.'\n'What kind of Affinity do I have then?'",

      "content": "Chapter 41 - Plateau\nAlex and the Elder walked to the entrance of the village.\nWhen some of the gathered villagers saw Alex, their eyes opened in surprise.\nAlex looked completely different from before!\nWhy?\nWell, when Alex had finished talking with the Elder after an hour or so, he stood up from the chair. That's when he noticed that the chair he had been sitting on was coated in mud and grime.\nAlex quickly realized that this had come from him, and he remembered that he hadn't washed in an eternity.\nHe wouldn't jump into icy water at such temperatures.\nSo, Alex had asked the Elder if he smelled.\nThe Elder had only awkwardly coughed into his hands.\nAfter that, the Elder offered him a chance to properly wash and take care of his clothing.\nAlex wanted to decline, but after some of the villagers had heard that their savior hadn't had an opportunity to wash in forever, they basically forced him.\nThey wouldn't want any other people outside the village to think that Coldew Village didn't take care of its visitors!\nThey had filled a big barrel with ice and snow and put it above a small campfire, and while Alex was taking his first bath in this world, his clothes were being washed by some of the older women in the village.\nAlex wasn't sure how they had done it, but his coat looked nearly perfect. It was almost like it was new.\nAs for the clothes beneath Alex's coat, they had been thrown away.\nInstead, Alex got a set of new clothing made out of animal hide.\nIn such a cold environment, cotton didn't grow. Because of that, the villagers mainly used the skin of their pigs and cows to fashion clothing.\nWhen Alex came out of his bath, it was like he had become a new man.\nThe bath had felt divine!\nAlex also thought that since he was already clean, he could also cut his hair and shave.\nAfter everything was done, Alex put on his new clothes and old coat.\nHe no longer looked like someone living in the wild but like a suave young warrior from some village.\nThen, Alex had spent the night in a free room in a random house.\nThis was the best sleep Alex had ever had since arriving in this world!\nAlex only very rarely slept since his meditation could supplement sleep to some degree. Additionally, sleeping in the wilds was dangerous.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ After waking up, Alex felt refreshed and said that he wanted to leave.\nThe Elder brought him to the exit of the village, and all the villagers looked with shock at him.\nHe was so young!\nWhen they had seen him previously, they had imagined him to be some 30-year-old man.\nHowever, now, Alex barely looked like an adult!\nHe almost looked like a teenager!\nAlex had grown a bit ever since arriving in this world, but he still had some growing to do. He barely reached 170 centimeters.\nWhen Alex arrived at the exit of the village, he spotted a sled with some wheels at its side.\n'That's surprisingly small,' Alex thought.\nThe sled wagon was barely one meter wide and two meters long.\nAdditionally, there wasn't even much wood on it. The wood barely reached a meter in height. Even more, the wood was very finely cut. It was like someone had taken a standard piece of cut wood and halved it two more times.\nSure, it was massive to some degree, but Alex was sure that he could pull more.\n'It takes up about half of the sled wagon, so it should come to about one cubic meter of wood.'\nAlex looked at the villagers and the smiling Elder and couldn't bring himself to ask for more.\n'They already helped me plenty. I can always earn the remainder in Warrior's Paradise.'\nAlex looked at the surroundings and saw that everything was still coated in snow. This meant that he didn't need to put the wheels on the sled car yet.\nAlex turned to the villagers and nodded with a smile. \"Thank you all,\" he said.\nThe villagers said that it was no problem, and the Elder gave him some last advice for his way.\nAlex nodded and said his goodbyes.\nAll the villagers waved after him as Alex walked over to the sled wagon.\nAlex grabbed the rope at the front and pulled.\nAnd the sled wagon didn't move.\nAlex looked with surprise at the sled wagon.\n'Okay, maybe this is heavier than I thought.'\nAlex pulled with more force, and the rope shook violently under the strain.\nAnd finally, after putting a lot of force into it, Alex could move the sled.\nAlex threw the villagers a shocked expression, and most of them only smiled back while some of them oh-ed in respect when they saw that he could move the sled wagon.\n'That's definitely more than a ton!' Alex thought. 'I know the power of my new body, and one ton is not that heavy! That's more like 1.5 or 2 tones!'\nAlex started to feel bad about wanting to ask for more.\nThe villagers had already given him more than he had asked for.\n'However, the Ice Wood is truly massive,' Alex thought. 'Just a mere cubic meter is already closing in on two tons of weight! No wonder it's cut into such a small size. One of these small pieces is probably as heavy as an average-sized piece of wood.'\nAlex waved thankfully at the villagers again and began pulling.\nAnd with that, Alex began his journey to Warrior's Paradise.\nHe wasn't sure exactly how far away it was, but Storm Eagle Zone should be the next zone towards the southeast, according to what the Elder had said.\nThe area was very uneven, and Alex had to fight against slopes and rises of mountains.\nPulling the sled wagon up a mountain was incredibly difficult. Alex's feet constantly lost their grip, and he was basically running against the elevation as his feet continually slipped away beneath him.\nHe essentially moved forward like a car with summer tires on pure ice.\nEvery five rotations of the wheel would only move the car one rotation worth of distance.\nIt was incredibly tiresome.\nMeanwhile, the slopes were not very tiresome.\nInstead, they were very stressful.\nAlex basically stood in front of the sled with his feet firmly on the ground. The sled was pushing him forwards, and Alex had to slow it down by continually grinding his feet against the ground.\nHis new shoes had already undergone a lifetime's worth of stress in just two hours.\nHowever, the shoes remained in one piece, surprisingly.\nTwo hours later, after ascending another slope, Alex's eyes widened in wonder and shock.\n'So that's what the Elder meant when he said that I would get a fun surprise on my way to the Storm Eagle Zone,' Alex thought.\nRight now, Alex was on top of an absolutely gigantic slope.\nEven more, Alex noticed that he was basically on top of a mountain!\nWhen Alex looked to his side and behind him, he saw relatively even ground, but when he looked into the distance, everything was far below him in elevation.\nAlex could see kilometers upon kilometers into the distance.\n'This is actually a plateau?' Alex thought in shock.\n'Even the Duke's garden is on this plateau!'\nHow huge was this plateau!?\nAlex looked back at the plateau behind him, and he could still see many huge mountains.\nAt this moment, Alex also felt the movement of the Ice Mana.\nAlex felt like all the Ice Mana of the plateau was flowing down the slope.\n'Does this mean that the Ice Wyvern is somewhere on this plateau? Why else would so much Ice Mana flow down from here?' Alex thought.\nAlex had thought that the resident godly beast was far away, but it had turned out that it had been closer than he had thought.\n'Where does that river in the Duke's garden even come from?' Alex thought.\nMany thoughts went through Alex's head, but he quickly got distracted by the land below him.\nThe area on the bottom of the gigantic slope was still filled with snow and ice, but the ground was far more even. Alex wouldn't have to deal with all these slopes anymore.\nThen, Alex spotted a town on the horizon.\nIt was probably over ten kilometers away, but the path from here to there was only one long slope.\nAlex guessed that he was about two kilometers higher in elevation than the town.\nAlex looked at the town.\nThen, he looked at the slope.\nThen, he looked at the sled.\nAlex got a terrible idea.",

      "content": "Chapter 42 - Stupid Idea\n'That's a stupid idea, but I want to do it,' Alex thought. He felt nervous but also excited.\nAlex went over to the sled wagon and pulled it over the slope's edge. The sled wagon started to slide down, and Alex jumped on top of it. There was enough space in front of the Ice Wood that he could sit down, and he did just that.\nThe initial acceleration was somewhat slow, but then it became faster and faster.\nFirst, Alex felt nervous.\nThen, as the sled wagon became faster, he became excited.\nThen, he became nervous again.\nAnd then, he became terrified.\nAfter around 20 seconds, the sled wagon had accelerated to impressive speeds, and it only seemed to become even faster.\nAt first, the sled wagon had only brought a breeze to Alex's face, but the breeze had quickly transformed into a terrifying storm.\nAlex felt the sled wagon below himself shake, and he was sure that he heard a crack at some point!\nAlex's breathing and heart rate quickened as the sled wagon reached 150 kph in a matter of seconds.\nThen, it reached 200 kph.\nThen, 250 kph.\nThat was already a bit faster than terminal velocity for a falling human. The wind was as strong as the wind a skydiver would experience. However, skydivers had goggles on their eyes. Alex didn't.\nAlex already started regretting that he had gone through with that stupid idea!\nThe slope would even out about a kilometer in front of the city, which would give Alex enough time to slow down the sled wagon with his feet, but he had quickly realized that he might have overlooked something.\n'Can the sled wagon even stay in one piece?' Alex thought in fear. 'There's over a ton of Ice Wood on the sled wagon! Is this sled wagon even designed to resist something like 300kph or something? Seriously, I think I'm moving even faster than the hedgehog when it chased that octopus!'\nIf someone stood beside the passing sled wagon, they would only see a shadow pass by them, and after that, they would be assaulted by a terrifying storm.\nAlex had already slid for nearly four kilometers when something happened.\nThree people jumped out from behind a tree in the distance and walked to the slope.\nAlex's mind nearly stopped working when he saw those three men.\nWere they suicidal!?\nAlex was sure that they had noticed him since they were looking at him at this very moment.\n\"That guy seems to come from Coldew Village! We've hit it big, boys!\" one of the men said with a smirk.\nOne other guy laughed, while the third guy only looked solemnly at the approaching sled wagon.\n\"Hurry up! The guards have probably already seen us!\" the third guy shouted.\n\"Yeah, yeah. Just chill for a second, okay? We got this,\" the first guy said with exasperation.\n\"Let's go!\"\nThen, the three guys charged towards the approaching sled wagon.\n\"Move!\" Alex shouted with all of his power. Sadly, he was still too far away, making his voice very quiet.\n\"He said move,\" the second guy said with a snicker. \"Does the guy not realize that we are bandits?\" he asked.\n\"Plenty of villagers believe that they are uncatchable when they're sliding down the slope,\" the third guy explained. \"They think that no one would be willing to stop their sled wagons.\"\nThe first guy looked with a smirk at the approaching sled wagon. \"Sadly, they don't realize that we are all in the Mid-Soldier Stage! We can easily stop a mere sled wagon.\"\nMeanwhile, Alex looked with terror at the people running at him from a distance.\n'Are they insane!? Even I would be absolutely obliterated if I got hit by this sled! That sled wagon weighs over a ton and goes like 300 kph!' Alex thought.\n\"Move, or you will die!\" Alex shouted.\nIn these couple of seconds, Alex had already moved several hundred meters, and he was only about 200 meters away from the three of them.\nThe three guys continued moving towards Alex, but they slowly came to a halt.\n\"Isn't that sled moving a bit too- oh shit!\"\nEver seen anything speeding right at you from a distance?\nIt's difficult to see how fast something is going when it comes right at the viewer.\nThe bandits had thought that this was just some guy from some village who came to buy something. They had thought that he was probably here to buy medicine or something like that. After all, people from the villages rarely came to the city without a good reason. Dragging the sled wagon up the slope was just too tiring and too much of a hassle.\nThey had also been sure that Alex had had no major wares on his sled wagon.\nWhy?\nFirst of all, Alex had been very far away.\nSecond, Alex's body was blocking a major part of the Ice Wood behind him.\nThird, no merchant or delivery person would risk their cargo by sliding down this slope.\nSo, in the minds of the three bandits, this sled wagon had probably weighed something like 150 kg, including the person riding it, and it would also probably only go 100 kph, max.\nTwo people would have simply grabbed the sides of the sled wagon to stop it, while the third one would have threatened the rider.\nSadly, they had been off with their calculations.\nEven more, they had only noticed something when Alex was 200 meters away.\nHow fast were 300kph?\nSomething moving at 300kph moved a bit less than 100 meters per second.\nThat was a kilometer of distance in a bit more than ten seconds.\nIt was ridiculously fast!\nIn short, after the bandits had become suspicious, they only had two seconds left to dodge.\nThe third guy of the group had immediately jumped to the side since he had been very careful the entire time. Thanks to that, he had just barely evaded the sled wagon.\nThe other two were not as lucky.\nThe first guy had managed to jump to the side, but his legs were still in the sled wagon's path.\nAs soon as the sled wagon hit the bandit's legs, an explosion of blood occurred. One leg was flung into the distance while the other one barely held on by some flesh and skin. The bandit's body started rotating at insane speeds, and he fell to the ground.\nThe second guy hadn't managed to jump very far.\nThe right side of the sled wagon hit him in the abdomen.\nA shower of blood assaulted Alex, and a severed leg hit him in the chest, cracking several ribs.\nHowever, Alex didn't care very much about his injury since his mind was preoccupied with processing what had just happened.\n'Did I kill someone?' Alex thought in shock.\nFor some seconds, Alex's mind just wouldn't work, but the urgency of the situation quickly woke him up.\n'The slope's angle is evening out! I have to stop the sled wagon!' Alex thought.\nAlex put his legs to the ground, but he immediately pulled them back.\nWhen he had just slightly touched the ground, his leg had nearly been torn off!\n'I can't brake!'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ For the first time in a long while, Alex was genuinely terrified.\n'I'm going to hit the city walls!'",

He couldn't even change its direction or brake!\nAfter some seconds of panic, Alex reached the even ground, but the sled didn't seem to stop at all.\nIt just kept on going!\n\"Jump down!\"\nA powerful shout came from the city walls when Alex had still been over a kilometer away. Alex didn't even think about how loud that shout had been to be heard from such a long distance.\nAlex looked to the side at the rapidly passing surroundings.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ How was he supposed to jump off something that's moving so fast?!\nHowever, Alex's mind, which had gotten used to stressful situations, quickly came up with a solution.\nAlex gritted his teeth. 'Let's hope this works!'\nAlex put his left hand to the Ice Wood behind him for two seconds. In these two seconds, Alex absorbed a lot of Ice Mana, and the familiar feeling of bursting appeared.\nThen, Alex took a deep breath and jumped to the side, protecting his head with his arms.\nEverything seemingly moved in slow motion for Alex.\nBANG!\nAlex hit the ground, and his body was violently thrown around. Alex spun several times in the air, and he felt the centripetal force pulling his arms away.\nBANG!\nA second hit, and several of Alex's bones broke.\nAlex completely lost his sense of direction, and he had no idea where he was going.\nBANG!\nAlex hit something, but after a brief moment of resistance, it gave way. He felt himself nearly puke at the force that hit his body just now.\nBANG!\nAlex hit the ground again, and his shoulder broke.\nBANG!\nHe hit another thing, which quickly gave way beneath his force.\nBANG!\nBANG!\nBANG!\nAfter several more hits, Alex eventually stopped.\nAlex lay on the ground, and he felt like he was dying. Yet, while everyone else would feel despair at being in such a state, Alex only looked with shock at the sky.\n'I'm still alive!'\nAlex knew that he would survive since he had gone through similar experiences. He knew that the Mana would heal his body.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nAlex heard the sounds of something incredibly powerful hitting through something, and he knew that this could have only been the sled wagon.\n'I'm in so much trouble.'\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nMore explosive sounds followed, and Alex didn't want to look at the damage he had caused.\nAfter two more sounds, it stopped.\nAlex only continued lying there.\n'How am I supposed to pay for all that?' he thought. 'Would they take Ice Wood as payment?'\n'How many people got injured?'\n'Speaking of, I think I just killed one of those bandits.'\nSilence.\nAlex only looked at the sky as he tried to come to terms with what had just happened.\nAfter about of minute of just lying around and thinking about what he had done, Alex slowly stood up.\nClank, clank, clank.\nAlex heard the sound of approaching, armored footsteps, and he looked at his surroundings for the first time.\nHe was in the forest on the side of the road.\n'So, the things I punched through were trees,' Alex realized as he saw several destroyed trees. 'If I still had a normal body, the first tree would have killed me.'\nAlex had left behind a trail of destruction in the forest.\n\"Oh, you can move?\" a gruff voice said with surprise and a bit of amusement.\nAlex looked over, and he saw five men. One of them stood at the front, and he wore bright-silver armor. The four men behind him wore grey, iron armor.\n\"What damage did I cause?\" Alex asked.\nThe leading man had anticipated the question, but he hadn't thought it would be the first one.\n\"Nothing,\" the man said with a smirk.\nThis immediately dumbfounded Alex.\nFor a while, Alex wasn't even sure if he had heard correctly.\n\"Nothing?\" he asked for confirmation.\n\"Yes, nothing,\" the leading man answered with a rough chuckle.\n\"How?!\" Alex shouted.\nThe four men behind the leading man were silent, but the leading man laughed loudly. \"Earth Mages are very useful,\" he said. \"Also, do you honestly believe something like this hasn't happened before? Merchants lose control over their sleds all the time.\"\n\"However, I have to say that your case was the most notable out of all of them. You had over a ton of Ice Wood on your sled wagon, and it took four Earth Apprentices to stop it. They even had to ingest some valuable pills to stop it. Of course, you have to pay for them.\"\nAlex was still perplexed.\nHow did they stop something like that?!\n\"What about the three men that I ran over?\" Alex asked.\n\"Oh, them? Don't worry about them. They've been a plague for a while,\" the man said. \"There's even a bounty for them.\"\nAlex had expected something like that, but he was still a bit surprised that the guard even laughed about the fate of the bandits. \"Did they survive?\"\n\"One of them died on impact, one of them got finished off by us, and the last one fled. We are currently chasing the last one,\" the guard said with delight. \"You've done us a great service, but you also have to pay for our help. The pills the mages had to ingest were a bit more expensive than the reward, but I'm willing to cancel the debt out with your reward. These three guys have annoyed me for way too long.\"\nAlex felt a pressure in his chest when he heard that he had killed someone.\nAlex had killed plenty of beasts, but killing a human still felt different.\nThe guard noticed Alex's expression. \"Oh, was that your first kill?\" he asked.\nAlex slowly nodded.\n\"Man, you're lucky,\" the guard said with a snort.\n\"Lucky?\" Alex asked in shock.\nWhat was lucky about that?!\n\"Yeah, lucky,\" the guard repeated. \"Not only was your first kill an accident, but you also killed a bandit. That's way easier to come to terms with than killing another soldier or civilians. In comparison to your lucky ass, my first kill was an execution.\"\nIt was still difficult for Alex to come to terms with taking another human life.\n\"Oh, come on,\" the guard said as he stepped closer. \"You'll get over it. This was actually a good thing for you. It will help you in the Warrior Academy.\"\nAlex's eyes widened. \"How did you know that I wanted to go there?\" he asked. Alex was still a bit perplexed by everything that had happened.\n\"You're young, you have a very powerful body, judging by the fact that you are still alive after all of this, and you are traveling with a ton of Ice Wood toward the southeast. That Ice Wood is obviously for the special exam,\" the guard said with a smirk. \"Also, you kind of feel like a student of the Warrior Academy.\"\n\"Come,\" the guard said, turning around and gesturing to the street with his head.\nThe guard passed his men and continued walking away.\nAfter some seconds, Alex shook his head and followed.\nSome seconds later, Alex saw the slope again, and his eyes widened.\nAlex saw a figurative mountain of rubble strewn across the slope. The entire slope was covered with grey stones.\n\"Our Earth Apprentices created several walls made of stone,\" the guard explained while Alex looked at the aftermath. \"Your sled wagon punched through seven of them before being stopped by the eighth. That's a new record! The old record had only managed to get through three. Quite impressive.\"\nWhen Alex heard how the town had stopped his sled wagon, he was surprised.\nIf they had stopped it with walls of stone, how come Alex didn't see any pieces of wood anywhere?\n\"Come,\" the guard ordered again as he walked to the end of the slope.\nAlex followed the guard, and eventually, the group arrived at a small wall made of grey stone. However, the wall wasn't straight but tilted.\n\"Oh?\" the guard said with surprise. \"Would you look at that. The last wall wasn't destroyed, but your sled wagon managed to break it off at the base. I think we can count it as having broken through eight walls then.\"\n\"Look,\" the guard said as he walked to the piece of wall.\nBANG!\nThe guard lightly kicked the piece of wall, and the wall flew for over two meters.\nObviously, the kick hadn't been as light as it had seemed.\nAlex looked over and saw the front of his sled wagon, and his eyes widened yet again.\nThe front was bent but still in one piece!\nHow?!\n\"How is it still in one piece?\" Alex asked in shock.\nThe guard laughed and lightly kicked the sled wagon.\nBANG!\nAn explosive sound resounded throughout the surroundings, but the sled wagon only turned to the side a bit.\nIt was still in one piece.\nThe guard turned to Alex with a smirk.\n\"Ice Wood is hard. To think that you would actually have a sled wagon made of Ice Wood. That's about one of the most extravagant things I have ever seen,\" the guard said with a laugh.",

      "content": "Chapter 44 - Dark Iron Ore\nIce Wood?\nThe sled wagon was made of Ice Wood?\nAlex's mind immediately went to the friendly villagers. Not only had they given him so much Ice Wood, but they had also created a sled wagon out of Ice Wood. They sure had gone all out with their repayment.\nHowever, after some seconds, Alex looked away from the sled wagon and turned his gaze towards the slope.\nAlex could see blood on the slope, as well as two bodies. Some guards were currently pulling the bodies to the side of the slope, and after they got there, they simply threw the bodies into the forest.\nApparently, bandits didn't get a proper burial.\nSuch a scene seemed unimportant, but it gave Alex a feeling of disconnect.\nOn Earth, even mass murderers would get a burial. After one's death, everyone was the same on Earth.\nBut here, these bandits were simply thrown to the side of the road.\nNo one minded such a scene, but Alex felt like this scene was showing the differences between this world and Earth very well.\nLife truly wasn't seen with as much importance here as on Earth.\n'I killed one of them,' Alex thought with discomfort.\nAlex felt some guilt appear in his chest, but it wasn't as overwhelming as he had thought.\nEvery human had thought about how it would feel to kill someone else at least once. Some edgy teenagers might think that they wouldn't feel anything, but the truth was always different.\nTaking a human life woke a certain feeling of pressure and wrongness in one's chest.\nEven if a person hated someone else, when that other person died suddenly, the first person would still feel some discomfort.\nThis feeling would be far stronger if one was responsible for their death.\nWishing someone else to die was normal, and it happened all the time, but when it actually happened, one would still feel uncomfortable.\nHowever, Alex's feelings weren't as intense as he had imagined them to be. He definitely felt something, but it was still manageable.\n'Is that normal?' Alex thought.\nSilence.\n'I don't know.'\n\"Hey! Get your sled wagon out from below the rubble. We need to clean the slope for other merchants,\" the guard said, pulling Alex out of his thoughts.\n\"Oh, right, sorry,\" Alex said absentmindedly.\nAlex went over to his sled wagon and pushed the stones off the sled wagon. After a bit of cleaning up, Alex could see the entire sled wagon again.\nThe cage with all the Ice Wood was displaced since the rope broke, but it was still close to the sled wagon.\nIt took a lot of work, but Alex managed to put the cage with the Ice Wood back on top of the sled wagon.\nAnd then, the sled wagon was ready to be moved again.\n\"Anyway, welcome to the Central Wild!\" the guard said with a smirk.\n\"Is that the name of the town?\" Alex asked.\nThe guard nodded. \"Yep. You need to leave through the southern entrance if you want to get to the Storm Eagle Zone. However, I would suggest that you stay here for the night. The Southern Wild is about a day of travel away, and it's already afternoon.\"\nAlex nodded. \"Thanks,\" he said.\nThen, Alex pulled the sled wagon towards the town.\nThe guard and his men started cleaning the slope as Alex went to the town.\nAfter a bit of pulling, Alex arrived at the gate, and he was allowed to enter without any inspection. The guards had probably already inspected his sled wagon earlier.\nAlex saw that the streets actually had no snow on them, but that wasn't an issue. Alex went to the side of his sled wagon and loosened the ropes around the wheels. The wheels were fixed to the sled wagon with beams made of Ice Wood, and they fell down and hit the ground.\nAfter loosening all four wheels, Alex went to a corner of the sled wagon.\nCrk!\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex lifted the corner and moved the wheel until the wood beam was straight. Then, Alex kept the beam straight and fastened the rope on the beam again.\nAfter doing that for all four corners, Alex pulled the sled wagon into the town on its wheels.\nHe didn't need to put much force into the pull since pulling something with wheels was easier than pulling a sled through snow.\nAs Alex traveled through the town, many people watched him with interest. They had heard about the commotion in front of the northern gate, and they guessed that Alex was responsible for it.\nHowever, none of the townspeople came up to start a conversation. They were more interested in watching.\nThe town wasn't really big. It probably was only a kilometer across.\nEventually, Alex passed through a marketplace, being careful that he didn't damage anything with his heavy sled wagon.\nSuddenly, Alex felt his sword vibrate. Alex took out the sword and looked at it with interest.\nAn invisible force pulled Alex's attention to a stall at the side of the road. The stall was made of wood, and it was quite wide and deep. Alex saw stones, gems, and metals being displayed at the front, and he could see several different kinds of ore in the back of the stall.\nAlex remembered that he could increase the power of his sword with ore, and he quickly realized that this was the reason why his sword was vibrating.\n\"Can I help you?\" the salesman on the stall asked after realizing that Alex was eyeing his store.\nAlex calmly took out his sword and put it on the counter. \"Do you have something for weapons useful for warriors in the General Realm?\" Alex asked.\nAlex was in the First Realm, which was called the Soldier Realm for physical fighters. The General Realm was the Second Realm.\nAlex knew that his weapon was probably useful for warriors in the Soldier Realm. So, if he wanted to increase its power with ore, he needed it to be of the second Realm.\nWhen the salesman heard Alex's words, a bright smile appeared on his face. \"We specialize in such ore. The Dark Iron Ore is the ore of choice for warriors in the General Realm,\" the man said.\nAlex nodded. \"How much to reforge this entire sword with Dark Iron Ore?\" he asked.\n\"We don't do forging,\" the man said.\n\"I know. I meant how much for the required Dark Iron Ore to reforge the sword?\" he asked.\nThe man looked at the sword on the table.\n\"40 gold,\" he said. \"We get our Dark Iron Ore from a local mine, which is why it's so cheap. You would normally have to pay over 50 gold for something like this.\"\nAlex's eyes widened.\n\"Oh, okay. Thanks. I'll be going then,\" he said.\nThe salesman deflated when he realized that Alex didn't buy anything. \"Do come again,\" he said without any motivation.\n\"Seems like you have to wait,\" Alex said quietly to his sword.\nSurprisingly, Alex felt like his sword vibrated a little.\nAlex had already realized that his sword wasn't so simple, but he still wasn't quite sure about its abilities.\nHe probably had to wait until he had enough money to upgrade it to find out more.\nAfter a while of pulling, Alex reached the southern gate, and he went through it.\nThe guard had said that Alex should spend the night here, but Alex didn't plan on doing that.\nFirst of all, Alex didn't have any money, and he couldn't just pay in Ice Wood. There was no sense in spending the night in the town when he would sleep on the ground.\nSecond, it was still afternoon, and Alex could still get some hours of travel out of the day.\nThird, Alex was used to sleeping in the wild.\nSo, Alex decided to directly continue to the Southern Wild.",

      "content": "Chapter 45 - Usage Of Mana\nAlex left through the southern entrance and saw the southern area behind the Central Wild.\nIt didn't look much different from the other parts of this Zone, except for maybe it being a bit flatter. There were still some hills here and there, but it wasn't as exaggerated as the northern part of the town.\nAs Alex went past the southern entrance, he put the wheels of the sled wagon away again and transformed it back into a sled.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Then, Alex took a deep breath and continued pulling.\nIt was currently afternoon, and Alex still had enough daylight to travel.\nNot much of note happened as Alex continued traveling to the southeast. It was just incredibly boring and tiresome.\nAlex saw some big birds flying over the street occasionally, and Alex always stopped to look at them. He didn't want to be caught by surprise by some powerful bird swooping down from the sky.\nThese birds looked rather powerful, and Alex didn't trust that they didn't eat humans.\nAlex even saw some of the bigger birds flying circles above him, but they all left after circling him for two times or so. He wasn't sure if they were evaluating his power or if they were just curious.\nAfter a couple of hours, dusk arrived. Alex had probably traveled for around 25 to 30 kilometers in these couple of hours, which was way too slow for his liking. Sadly, the sled wagon was simply too heavy.\n'Being a trader sucks,' Alex thought. 'The merchants that passed me in the last couple of hours all used horses and bulls to pull their cargo. Wonder how expensive these animals are in this world. I didn't see many of them in the town.'\nSeveral traders had passed Alex during the last couple of hours. They were all driving way faster than him, and they all passed Alex easily. Most of them were driving carriages with trailers behind them, but that wasn't all.\nThe merchants also had bodyguards running alongside their small caravan. These bodyguards all threw Alex some confused looks, which was understandable. After all, Alex was pulling the sled wagon himself, and he was traveling alone.\nWhenever a merchant passed Alex, he heard several greetings from the guards, and the merchants even told him their names and their specialties. They had seen the sled wagon Alex was pulling, and they knew that he would earn big money with all that Ice Wood. To the merchants, Alex was a potential client.\nBut all of that had stopped about an hour ago.\nStarting from an hour ago, no more merchants passed Alex, which gave him some insight into the remaining distance to the southern wilds.\n'There should be about half an hour of daylight left, and everyone stopped passing me about an hour ago. That means that their carriages can't travel the remaining distance in one and a half hours.'\n'The carriages were traveling at around 40kph, which means that there should be about 50 to 60 kilometers left. I'm moving at around ten kph, which means that I probably have around five to six hours of travel left. Sure enough, in total, it should be about a day's worth of travel. The guard was right.'\n'Anyway, I think it's time to pause for the night. I don't know what kind of creatures are living here since all the merchants are avoiding traveling through the night.'\nAlex pulled the sled wagon to the side of the road, into the forest. It wasn't easy to find a gap big enough for the sled wagon to pass through, but after a bit of searching, Alex found one.\nAfter putting the Sled Wagon partly into the forest, Alex left the sled wagon and stretched. 'Man, my muscles are all sore.'\nAfter a bit of stretching, Alex took out his sword and began training. He never skipped a day of training.\nBy now, Alex was able to swing his sword with incredible speed, and whenever he unleashed a strike, one could basically only see an afterimage due to the strike's speed. Alex's different kinds of attacks also flowed more easily into each other, eliminating the awkwardness between strikes.\nAlex hated awkwardness in his fighting style, and he tried his best to get rid of it.\nAfter about an hour of swinging his sword, Alex was drenched in sweat, which was normal.\nAlex jumped up a nearby tree and sat down on one of its thick branches. The trees around Alex were still mostly conifers, but he had long since gotten used to sitting on branches filled with small needles.\nThe reason why Alex was sleeping on the trees was that he wanted to be careful. He had no idea what kinds of creatures or beasts lived here, and if he had to fight one, he would rather have the initiative. If he stayed the night on the carriage, basically everything in the surroundings would notice him.\nHowever, by staying on a tree, all the curious eyes would be drawn to the carriage first, allowing Alex to gather information on any newcomer.\nAlex closed his eyes and started meditating. Meditation worked somewhat as a replacement for sleeping, but he still needed to sleep for about six hours every two days. Of course, Alex wasn't stupid enough to sleep in an unknown region.\nAlex slowly lost himself to his meditation. All his muscles had already fully recovered in just a couple of minutes, but Alex continued meditating to bridge over the time he should be asleep.\nMeditating without training wouldn't increase Alex's power, but it wasn't useless. Alex was pretty good at controlling Mana by now, but after every couple of sessions of meditation, his ability to control Mana became even better.\nAlex's body wasn't without Mana. Yes, his Mana was mainly used to train his body, but Alex had noticed that he also had some Mana stored inside all his muscles. Right now, that stored Mana mainly acted as a storage used for regenerating injuries.\nWith Alex's higher control over Mana, he had noticed that the stored Mana was being used up during his training. That's when Alex had realized that the stored Mana worked similarly to the sugar stored in one's liver.\nTo move a body, one needed energy, which mainly came from the stored glucose in one's liver. At least, that's how it had been on Earth. When the glucose was used up, the body burned fat, but the burning of fat was way more complicated, and the process was quite elaborate.\nBy burning fat, the body couldn't reach the same explosive power as by burning glucose. As a former athlete, Alex had to know all of these things.\nSo, how did Mana differ?\nFrom what Alex had seen, Mana worked like an upgraded version of sugar. By moving around, Alex's body was using up Mana. Of course, Alex's body also had a passive regeneration of Mana, which was strong enough to get him through an entire day of work.\nThe passive regeneration of Mana was strong enough to allow Alex to jog indefinitely, assuming he didn't need to sleep or eat. Yet, if Alex started running, sprinting, jumping, or slashing with his full power, he would use up far more Mana than he was regenerating. It became even crazier when he injured himself.\nApparently, healing an injury took a ridiculous amount of Mana. In the past, when Alex got injured, his passive Mana storage would be nearly entirely used up just by healing a cut, but now, Alex had enough control over his Mana to stop that from happening.\nObviously, the ability to continue jumping around and fighting was more important than healing a cut.\n'The ability to control Mana is probably of imperative importance,' Alex thought while meditating. 'Mana is technically a very potent form of energy, and you can basically do anything with enough energy. I'm certain that I can use the Mana in my body for more than just jumping around and attacking. There have to be other kinds of uses.'\n'Well, I should learn all these things after joining that academy. It's funny that I'm actually looking forward to going to school. I've always hated school.'\nCrk.\nAlex opened his eyes as he heard the sound of something stepping onto a twig.\nAlex looked at the origin of the sound, and he saw a familiar beast.\n'Oh hey, another Frozen Lake Stag,' Alex thought as he looked at the small stag. 'Its antlers are smaller, and they're not shining brightly. I can also not feel as much Mana coming from it. It's definitely weaker than the one I killed.'\nThe Frozen Lake Stag was carefully moving towards Alex's sled wagon.\nThere was a ton of Ice Wood on the sled wagon, and the Frozen Lake Stag loved Ice Wood.\nOne could say it was hungry.\nHowever, it wasn't the only thing that felt hungry.\nAlex looked at the Frozen Lake Stag greedily.",

      "content": "Chapter 46 - Silent Danger\nAlex sat on the tree while a campfire was burning below him. Several skewers filled with meat were hanging near the fire, and Alex was eating one of those skewers right now. From time to time, Alex jumped down, retrieved another skewer, and went back to the tree. He still wasn't sure what kind of creatures lived in this area, so he tried to remain hidden.\nAnything that came here would have its attention drawn to the fire and sled wagon, leaving Alex the initiative.\nAfter eating quite a bit of meat, Alex pulled the remaining skewers from the fire, put some of his spare clothes around them, and put them on the sled wagon. He would eat them tomorrow while traveling.\nA couple of hours passed, and it was now well into the night.\nThat's when Alex felt something approach.\nAlex didn't hear or see the approaching creature, but he felt a lot of Ice Mana moving towards him.\nAlex slowly stood up from the branch and silently moved to the next tree.\nA feeling of nervousness appeared in Alex, but he forced himself to remain calm. 'Judging by the amount of Ice Mana being displaced, this is probably a creature of the Second Realm, and it's definitely not in the earlier stages.'\n'I can't fight that.'\nAfter moving two trees away from his makeshift camp, Alex closed his eyes to concentrate on feeling the Ice Mana in the atmosphere.\nIn Alex's mind, he saw a sizable, blue ball of Ice Mana moving towards his old camp. The blue ball of Mana was about two meters in diameter, which confused Alex a bit.\n'It feels like the creature is about as long as it is wide. It's not as tall as it's wide or long, but it is still quite tall. I wonder what kind of creature that could be?'\nSurprisingly, Alex heard absolutely nothing.\nThe forest was completely silent, which was a scary thought.\nA creature of such a size should make some sort of noise. Sure, the Pest Cats were also silent creatures, but they had an Affinity for Darkness. Alex was pretty certain that the Darkness Affinity allowed the Pest Cats to remain silent.\nYet, the creature that had just entered Alex's camp obviously had an Ice Affinity.\n'If I couldn't perceive Ice Mana, my survival would depend on luck. I would have remained on my branch, and I wouldn't even have noticed it. My survival would have completely hinged on it not seeing me on my branch.'\nAccording to Alex's perception, the creature stopped before Alex's campfire, and then, Alex felt like it had gotten colder.\n'Did it put out the fire? It probably doesn't like fire due to its Affinity.'\nThen, Alex felt the creature going to his sled wagon. The sled wagon was made of Ice Wood, which had a lot of Ice Mana. Because of that, the sled wagon was also visible in Alex's perception.\n'I hope it doesn't consume all the Ice Mana.'\nThe creature went to the sled wagon and stopped in front of it for a couple of seconds. After that, the ball symbolizing the creature went over the sled wagon.\nAlex grew nervous. If that thing consumed all the Ice Mana in the Ice Wood, everything would have been for nothing.\nLuckily, the creature only walked around the sled wagon. It climbed over it, circled it, and stopped beside it. Obviously, it was quite curious about the sled wagon.\nThe creature moved around a lot, but Alex had never heard any sound coming from it.\nSome seconds later, the creature left the sled wagon without absorbing the Ice Mana.\nYet, Alex felt it coming towards him. It wasn't moving very fast, but it was definitely coming towards his tree.\nAlex narrowed his eyes as he made a split-second decision.\nWhoom!\nAlex shot an Ice Blast to his front and quickly circled the tree.\nIn Alex's perception, the ball of Ice Mana shot towards the direction of Alex's Ice Blast with incredible speed.\nAlex didn't hear any sound.\nAfter that, Alex slowly and silently climbed down the tree and snuck towards his sled wagon.\n'That thing has an Ice Affinity, and it can probably also feel Ice Mana. It probably felt a little bit of Ice Mana coming from my left arm.'\nIn Alex's perception, the blue ball of Ice Mana was rapidly moving around the forest. It was moving up trees, going down trees, and running around trees. It had suddenly felt a lot of Ice Mana, and it was searching for the origin.\nAlex had to use all of his self-control to not sprint towards his sled wagon. He had to move slowly.\nEventually, the creature went back to the tree Alex had just been on. Alex felt how the creature climbed up the tree and moved all around it. If Alex had remained there, he would have been spotted.\nAlex arrived at the sled wagon and slowly crawled beneath it. Then, he remained motionless and silent.\nThat thing had an Ice Affinity, and it could obviously feel Ice Mana. Alex's left arm was a dead giveaway, and he had to deal with it.\nSo, Alex decided to mask the Ice Mana in his arm with the Ice Mana of all the Ice Wood.\nAlex hoped that the Ice Mana of the Ice Wood would outshine the little bit of Ice Mana on his left arm.\nThe creature inspected all the different trees in the surroundings, but it eventually went back to the sled wagon.\nThen, it simply stopped at the spot where Alex's campfire had been.\nAlex opened his eyes from below the sled wagon, and he could finally see the creature.\n'No wonder it was so silent.'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Eight long, blue icicles were fusing with the snow on the ground. It was like the snow and icicles were one and the same thing.\nWhenever the creature moved its icicles, it would leave a tiny part of the icicles behind. If one didn't look for these parts, one wouldn't notice them. They were only some small, azure spots on the snow.\nAlex also looked at the ground beneath him, and he saw the same azure spots. The creature had already been down here before.\nAlex moved his head a bit forward to see the creature.\n'Sure enough, it's a blue spider.'\nThe creature was one of those kinds of spiders with incredibly long, thin legs. Yet, its legs weren't actually legs but just long icicles. Only its actual body had flesh. Together with its legs, it was about two meters wide.\n'It replaced its legs with pure ice?' Alex thought.\nThe spider only rarely moved around, and Alex guessed that it was probably trying to sense any vibrations.\nThe spider remained motionless for about a minute, which felt like an hour to Alex.\nThen, the spider slowly walked away, leaving behind azure spots on the snow beneath it.\nAfter a while, Alex couldn't see it anymore, and he closed his eyes to check the surroundings with his perception.\nThe spider continued traveling for a while at a slow pace, but then, it suddenly exploded to the side.\nAlex felt the spider speed out of the range of his perception.\n\"Creee!\"\nAlex heard the painful screech of a beast.\nAlex took a deep breath and released a deep sigh.\nThe spider found its prey, which meant that it would return to wherever it had come from.\n'That was close,' Alex thought as he finally relaxed. 'Luckily, it had an Ice Affinity. I honestly need to be more careful in the future. Right now, I'm in the Ice Wyvern Zone, which is filled with Ice Mana. Nearly all the beasts in this Zone have an Ice Affinity, which gives me a way to perceive them before they reach me.'\n'However, that won't always remain like that. The Storm Eagle Zone is probably full of beasts with a Wind Affinity, and I can't feel Wind Mana. I'm pretty strong, but there are still several creatures in the wild that are more powerful than me. I should avoid staying outside if it can be helped.'\n'I've been too arrogant,' Alex thought with narrowed eyes.\nAlex slowly left the sled wagon and went back to his tree. The sled wagon was still a major beacon for all the creatures with an Ice Affinity, and Alex had only gone below it earlier because the spider had already thoroughly investigated it.\nLuckily, for the remainder of the night, nothing of note happened.\nWhen Alex saw the first light of day, he took a deep breath.\n'Time to continue.'",

      "content": "Chapter 47 - Warning\nAlex started the next day by continuing to pull his sled wagon along the road.\nAs always, it was very exhausting and boring.\nAbout two hours later, Alex saw the first merchants pass him again on their fancy carriages. The merchants introduced themselves, and the guards following the carriages also shot a short greeting to Alex.\nLuckily, no major event took place for the next couple of hours, and Alex safely arrived in the Southern Wild.\nAs Alex saw the gates of the town, he rubbed the sweat off his forehead.\nHowever, Alex quickly stopped as he noticed his own action.\n'Sweat?' Alex thought as he looked at his left sleeve. 'It's been a while since I actually sweated from exertion. The surroundings are always cold enough that I didn't need to sweat.'\nAlex pulled his right hand out of his cloak and felt the surroundings.\n'It's getting warmer,' Alex thought. 'Even more, it almost feels too hot under my coat.'\n'Seems like I'm close to leaving the Ice Wyvern Zone.'\nAlex continued pulling the sled wagon towards the Southern Wild. The town didn't really look special. It was like a town after it had gotten warmer after a heavy snowfall.\nIn short, it looked muddy and dirty.\nWhen Alex came to the northern gate, the guards stopped him and looked through his stack of Ice Wood for anything illegal. Their investigation was pretty thorough, taking nearly five minutes.\n\"Why do you want to enter the Southern Wild?\" the guard captain asked with practiced ease.\n\"I'm just in transit. I'm selling this Ice Wood in Warrior's Paradise for my entrance exam,\" Alex answered. He had noticed that several people knew about the Warrior Academy and its entrance exams, which was why he didn't add anything to his explanation.\nThe guard captain looked with surprise at Alex's face and squinted his eyes.\n\"Huh, you looked way older at first glance,\" the guard captain said. \"Alright, you can enter.\"\n\"I've got a question,\" Alex said.\n\"Sure,\" the guard captain said leisurely.\n\"Are there any dangers between here and Warrior's Paradise?\" Alex asked. \"I've spent the last night in the wilds between here and the Central Wild, and that was too close for comfort.\"\n\"Oh?\" the guard captain uttered as Alex got his attention. \"What did you encounter?\"\n\"General Stage spider,\" Alex said, \"and not the weak General Stage kind. It was azure and had eight icicles for legs. It moved very quietly through the night, and it nearly got me.\"\nThe guard captain's eyes narrowed. \"You saw an Icy Grave Widow?\" he asked.\n\"I don't know the name,\" Alex answered.\n\"Tch,\" the guard captain spat to the side. \"Of course it had to be an Icy Grave Widow. We've been searching for the cause of the nightly disappearances for a while now, but no one saw anything. They either come back without having encountered anything too dangerous or don't return at all.\"\n\"I thought we eradicated that pest a couple of months ago, but apparently, we missed some of the young,\" the guard captain added. \"Thanks for the intel. You've been a great help.\"\n\"No problem,\" Alex said.\n\"You said you were going to join the Warrior Academy, right? Are you interested in taking part in the hunt for the Icy Grave Widow? You seem pretty strong, and we could need someone like you,\" the guard captain said. \"Of course, you will also be paid generously.\"\nAlex was a bit surprised by the offer, but he immediately shook his head. \"Sorry, I'm not suicidal. If that thing were in the earlier levels of the General Realm, I could accompany you, but it's definitely stronger.\"\n\"Listen, your survival would basically be guaranteed,\" the guard captain added. \"We generally send several warriors in the General Realm to deal with Icy Grave Widows. It's not about if we get it or if we win the fight, but when.\"\n\"Sorry, I still have to decline,\" Alex answered. \"I've lived in the wilds for a long time, and I'm still not very comfortable around other humans. The thought of putting my life into the hands of others is something that I'm not comfortable with.\"\nAfter some seconds of silence, the guard captain only sighed. \"Fine, it's your decision after all. Anyway, as a reward for telling us about the Icy Grave Widow, I'll give you some information for your future journey.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Alex said.\n\"After you leave through the southeastern gate, you will have to travel for about two days to reach the next town. The town is called Blizzard's Edge due to its proximity to both Zones.\"\n\"On the path to Blizzard's Edge, you don't really have to be careful of any powerful beasts. The Elemental Mana is weak in the atmosphere, and beasts don't like that. You will, at most, see some early or middle Soldier Stage beasts, and those shouldn't be a problem for you,\" the guard captain explained.\nAlex nodded.\n\"However, the weak presence of beasts makes this place a haven for bandits. There's a known bandit camp located somewhere between here and Blizzard's Edge, but we haven't been able to find the camp yet.\"\n\"Their leader should be a Late Soldier Stage Warrior, but he only very rarely robs people himself. He has lackeys for that. The most powerful bandits you have a chance to meet should be a group of five led by a Middle Soldier Stage Warrior.\"\nAlex's eyes narrowed while the guard captain continued.\n\"However, you will probably not come across such a group,\" the guard captain added. \"The leaders of these squads are experienced, and they would quickly realize that you're not an easy target. The goal of the bandits is to make some easy money, not to fight someone to the death. You're not an easy target, and they will see that with one glance. Attacking you is too risky.\"\n\"So, if you meet any bandits, they will most likely be a group of newbies, and they won't be a danger to someone of your power.\"\nThen, the guard captain's eyes narrowed.\n\"However, that may be even more dangerous for you than meeting an experienced group of bandits,\" the guard captain added.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex lifted an eyebrow. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"Newbies have a certain aura of inexperience, fear, and nervousness on them,\" the guard captain explained. \"To an experienced warrior, they seem more like a group of rascals than bandits.\"\n\"Many warriors can't bring themselves to kill these newbie bandits and will only heavily injure them or scare them. They will most likely also throw some life advice at them.\"\n\"However, people that have become bandits have already fallen to a level of poverty we can't even imagine. All the life advice we can throw at them is useless. They won't accept the life advice someone gives them but will only get angry at the person.\"\n\"The newbies will then inform their higher-ups about the target, and you will meet with more powerful bandits. Even more, they know about your power now, and the group that will meet you will be comprised of many Middle Soldier Stage warriors.\"\nThe eyes of the guard captain pierced into Alex.\n\"If you meet any bandits, you can't allow them to escape,\" the guard captain said with severity.\n\"If someone tries to rob you, you must kill them. Otherwise, you're playing needlessly with your own life.\"\n\"The danger of this road for you are not beasts or powerful bandits, but your own innocence.\"\n\"I hope you can come to terms with killing some people that you will perceive simply as a bunch of kids.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 48 - Bandits\nAlex took a deep breath.\nKilling a bunch of kids?\nAlex's mind went back to the bandit he had run over on the way to the Central Wild. Alex still felt uncomfortable whenever he thought about that event.\nHowever, he hadn't killed them on purpose, and even more, he couldn't even have stopped the sled wagon if he wanted to. They had essentially thrown their own lives away.\nYet, this time, it would be different. The lives of these newbie bandits would be in his hands.\n\"Thank you for the advice. I'll keep it in mind,\" Alex said.\nThe guard captain nodded. \"No problem. You can't travel to Blizzard's Edge in one day anyway, which means that you have to camp on the way there. If some bandits decide to strike, it will be in the night.\"\n\"Thanks again,\" Alex added.\nThe guard captain motioned for Alex to enter the town with his head. \"Don't make a mistake. It's your life or theirs.\"\nAlex nodded again and entered the town.\nThere wasn't anything special in the town, and Alex simply passed through it in silence. Several merchants were asking him to buy stuff, but Alex ignored them.\nA couple minutes later, Alex exited through the southern gate of the Southern Wild.\n\"Is it fine if I stay near the walls of the city for the night?\" Alex asked the guard captain of this gate. \"I don't have any money to stay in the town, and I don't want to stay two nights on the road from here to Blizzard's Edge.\"\nThe guard captain looked at Alex with a bored expression. \"Sure. Bandits won't dare to come this close to the town. Just don't make too much noise.\"\nAlex nodded. \"Thanks, I won't.\"\nThe guard captain nodded back and went back to his job.\nAlex pulled the sled wagon to the side of the road and stretched.\nSHING!\nAlex pulled out his sword and started his training.\nAfter hours of training, Alex stopped when the sun went past the horizon.\nNight had arrived, and Alex decided to sleep. Alex had already skipped a night of sleep on the way to the Southern Wild, and he didn't want to feel tired for the journey to Blizzard's Edge.\n'I've traveled quite a bit in the last couple of days,' Alex thought. 'First, I went from Duke Whirlwind's garden to Coldew Village. Then, I went from Coldew Village to the Central Wild and from the Central Wild to the Southern Wild.'\n'Tomorrow, I will start the two-day journey to Blizzard's Edge. After that, I should be pretty close to Warrior's Paradise.'\nAlex's gaze traveled to the northwest.\nHe couldn't see any big mountains in that direction.\n'I can't even see the plateau anymore.'\nThen, Alex looked at the sled wagon behind him.\n'No wonder people pay a lot for Ice Wood in Warrior's Paradise. I haven't seen Ice Wood Trees ever since exiting Coldew Village, and the journey from Coldew Village to Warrior's Paradise is dangerous and long.'\n'Even a carriage pulled by horses will probably take two to three days to get to Warrior's Paradise from Coldew Village. Even more, the merchants have to hire guards if they want to save on travel time.'\n'If they traveled through the night, a carriage would probably only need about 24 hours for the journey, but they would need guards to protect them.'\n'Without guards, I think a carriage would leave Coldew Village at dawn and spend the night in the Southern Wild. After that, they would travel to Blizzard's Edge and spend the night there. Lastly, they would probably directly travel to Warrior's Paradise.'\n'One day of journey with guards or three days without guards. I guess it depends on the goods if it's worth hiring guards or not.'\nAlex's mind wandered to many places as he slowly succumbed to sleep.\nThis night, Alex slept on the ground while leaning his back on the sled wagon.\nThe night passed without any incidents.\nAlex woke up when it was still dark, but his inner clock told him that dawn would arrive soon.\n'Alright, let's go.'\nAnd thus, another exhausting day of travel started for Alex.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Alex pulled the sled wagon for over twelve hours.\nTens of carriages had already passed him, and Alex had also seen some camps of people traveling without carriages.\n'It's a feast for bandits.'\nBy now, Alex could see no more snow or mud. There were even some trees with actual leaves on them. Alex had almost forgotten what they looked like since he had been around nothing but conifers for months.\nThe temperature was still a bit cold, but it wasn't freezing.\nIf Alex had to put a month to the current weather, he would say march.\nThe winter was at its end, but spring wasn't fully there yet.\nWhen night arrived, Alex jumped onto his sled wagon and closed his eyes in meditation.\nAlex didn't want to train right now since he had to be in his peak condition for any eventual attacks.\nThe entire day, Alex had felt uncomfortable, and it had only gotten worse the closer night came. Alex wasn't afraid of the bandits, but he was afraid of having to kill some kids.\nAlex was in the body of a teenager, but he had actually been a young adult in his past life. Many teenagers thought of themselves as adults, but when they actually reached their twenties, they realized the difference between teenagers and actual adults.\nThere was a certain aura of confidence in adults that was nearly impossible for teenagers to emulate.\nA slight wind blew through the surroundings, and Alex felt the gentle movement of his hair in the wind.\nEverything was silent.\nHours passed.\nAlex felt a bit hungry, but he could get through a day without eating.\nAlex focused on gathering Mana in his meditation, and time passed rather quickly for him. It was like he was half-asleep and half-awake.\nSuddenly, Alex opened his narrowed eyes.\nHe had heard the sound of movement in the distance.\nAlex looked over, and he saw a shadow dart behind a tree.\nThe bandits had arrived!",

      "content": "Chapter 49 - Actions And Intentions\nAlex looked towards the area where he had seen the shadow. He had been certain that the shadow had had the shape of a human.\n'I really didn't want to do this,' Alex thought with narrowed eyes.\nNervousness crept into his heart as the thought of killing a couple of kids reared its ugly head.\nSHING!\nAlex took out his sword and held it beside himself.\nThe light of the moon slightly reflected off the black sword, making it just barely visible in the dark.\nThe forest returned to silence as Alex stood silently on top of the sled wagon, his head turned to the place where the bandits had just been.\nThe wind made Alex's coat wave in a rhythmic fashion, giving him the appearance of a creature ready to strike at any time.\nAlex's appearance was essentially warning everything and everyone in the surroundings that they shouldn't attack him.\nAlex knew how effective intimidation could be if someone didn't want to fight. He didn't need to appear aggressive like a bloodthirsty beast. He only had to look like something that wouldn't give up without a fight.\nHe hoped that the bandits would find an easier target.\nAlex wasn't afraid for his life, but for their lives.\nFor nearly a full minute, only silence reigned in Alex's surroundings.\nThen, two minutes passed.\nThree minutes.\nFive minutes.\nAfter seven minutes, Alex put his sword away and sat down again to meditate.\nThe bandits were gone.\nAlex took a deep breath and entered meditation again.\nHowever, just 40 minutes after entering meditation, Alex heard several tiny noises.\n'They returned, and there are more of them,' Alex thought with narrowed eyes.\nAlex slowly stood up again and drew his sword.\nTen seconds of silence passed again.\n\"Go!\"\nA loud shout echoed through Alex's small clearing, and Alex narrowed his eyes.\nSHING! SHING! SHING!\nIn an instant, over 15 people darted out of the trees as they ran towards Alex's sled wagon.\nYet, Alex gritted his teeth as he saw their appearances.\nThe bandits came from all walks of life. Alex could see some teenagers, but he could also see young adults, middle-aged men, and one older man.\nThey were all dirty, and they didn't wear any noteworthy armor. At most, some of them wore vests made of coarse leather and riddled with holes. The others wore raggy and old clothing.\nHowever, the worst part was that none of them carried weapons.\nThey all charged out of the trees without weapons, and even more, they didn't even look at Alex.\nThey fully focused on the Ice Wood on the sled wagon.\nThey never intended to attack or injure Alex, and he knew that.\nThey only wanted the Ice Wood, and they wouldn't attack or hurt Alex while stealing from Alex's sled wagon.\nAlex knew why they were doing this.\n'They realized that I'm not comfortable with killing people. So, they came out without any weapons or armor and without any intention of attacking me.'\n'They're banking on the fact that I'm unwilling to kill them.'\nAlex made a split-second decision and jumped towards the closest bandit.\nBANG!\nAlex punched the chest of the bandit, throwing him at a tree behind him.\nBANG!\nThe bandit hit the tree with a loud impact, and the sound of bones being broken reverberated throughout the small clearing.\nSilence.\nThe bandits stopped moving as they looked at their colleague.\nAlex looked at the other bandits with narrowed eyes, but his heart shook when he saw their eyes.\nThey weren't shocked, terrified, or angry.\nNo, their gazes were evaluating.\nIt was like they wanted to see what happened to their colleague.\nThe bandit that Alex had punched away coughed and took a deep breath.\nHe was still alive.\nThat was everything the bandits needed, and they immediately continued charging towards the sled wagon.\nSo what if they got injured? The others would share their loot with them, which would make all of this worth it.\nAs long as they didn't die, it would be worth it!\nThe first ones reached the sled wagon and began to tear at the cage holding the Ice Wood.\nAlex's nervousness increased as he gritted his teeth even harder.\nSHING!\n\"AAAHH!\"\nA bloody arm flew through the air.\nAlex had cut off the arm of one of the bandits, who had just clawed on the cage.\nThe other bandits paused for a second to look at what had happened.\nAnd then, they continued tearing with even more force.\nCRK!\nA part of the cage was torn off as the bandits greedily gathered the Ice Wood.\nMeanwhile, the bandit with one arm grabbed his arm, put it under his other arm, and also continued clawing at the Ice Wood with his free hand.\nAlex's eyes became bloodshot due to the stress and his inner conflict.\n'I can't let them get away with the Ice Wood! I need that!'\n'My goal is to become powerful! I want to reach heights that would have been impossible on Earth!'\nThe words of the guard captain shot through Alex's mind.\n\"It's your life or theirs.\"\nSHING!\nSilence.\nThe bandits looked over in shock as they paused.\nA headless body fell to the ground.\nAlex gripped his sword tightly.\n'It was so easy.'\n'My sword went through his body like butter.'\n'I just ended a human life.'\nAlex's arm shook as his nervousness and fear turned to rage.\nThese bandits had forced him to take a path of no return, and he hated them for it.\nHe had already killed one, and it didn't feel as bad as he had thought.\nThere was no immediate feeling of regret or terror.\nNo, it only felt like Alex had just lost something.\nKilling didn't feel that hard right now, and his anger was all the reason Alex needed.\nSHING!\nAlex diagonally bisected the torso of another bandit.\nHis sword was so sharp that the torso might as well not have existed.\nThe eyes of the bandits reflected deep fear. They quickly grabbed any Ice Wood they could carry and ran away.\nSHING!\nAlex killed another bandit.\n\"Drop the Ice Wood, and you can remain alive,\" he said coldly.\nNone of them listened.\nIt was like the Ice Wood was more important than their lives.\nAlex gritted his teeth.\nSHING! SHING!\nAlex killed two bandits before they could even move two meters away.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ These bandits were in the Early Stages of the Soldier Realm, at most. Some of them even had bodies on the same level as the humans on Earth.\n\"Drop it!\" Alex shouted.\nSome of the bandits looked back, and when they saw the additional corpses, they dropped the Ice Wood and continued running.\nHowever, the three most distant bandits didn't drop the Ice Wood. They had the best chance of getting away.\nBANG!\nThe ground below Alex nearly exploded as he charged forward with his full speed.\nIn less than a second, Alex arrived near the first bandit and killed him.\nBANG!\nAlex changed his trajectory to charge at the next bandit. They weren't all fleeing in the same direction.\nSome of the bandits felt a powerful wind pass them as a black shadow darted in and out of their vision.\nIn just two seconds, the second bandit died.\nThen, in another four seconds, the last bandit carrying Ice Wood died.\nOnly the sounds of hurried footsteps could be heard echoing throughout the forest.\nAlex didn't move as he simply looked at the newest corpse in front of him.\nThe image of a headless body and a solitary head made Alex feel like this thing wasn't a human.\nIt was hard for Alex to accept that the head and the body had been a human once.\nIt was like these two things weren't related at all.\nAlex looked into the terrified eyes of the head.\nThe head had belonged to a teenager.\nAfter some seconds, Alex wordlessly bowed down and pushed the body to the side. Alex's hand moved forward, and he took the solitary piece of Ice Wood from the corpse.\nAlex looked at the piece of Ice Wood for a while.\n'Was it worth it to die for one piece of Ice Wood?' Alex thought, gazing at the piece of Ice Wood.\nThen, Alex's gaze wandered to the head.\n'Was he deserving of death for only stealing a single piece of Ice Wood?'\nSilence.\nAlex couldn't find an answer for a long time.\nYet, eventually, he received his answer.\nCRACK!\nAlex destroyed the piece of Ice Wood in his hand.\n'It's not important what he stole.'\n'Actions aren't important. Intentions are.'\nAlex slowly stood up again and walked back to the sled wagon.\nAlex jumped onto the sled wagon and closed his eyes.\nThe entire time, he ignored the pieces of former humans.\n'It's my life or theirs.'\n'Actions aren't important. Intentions are.'\nAlex repeated these phrases several times in his head.\n'I have done what I had to do.'\nAnd thus, silence returned to the clearing.\nAlex repeated these phrases in his head throughout the night.\nAlex was the only living thing, and the area around his sled wagon was surrounded by the corpses of mortal men.\nThere were no weapons.",

      "content": "Chapter 50 - Reasons\nAn hour of silence passed.\nAlex couldn't enter meditation.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ His body was tense and shaking in anger from time to time.\n'I've done what I needed to do,' Alex kept repeating to himself in his mind.\nHe had already gotten used to the smell of blood, but Alex subconsciously breathed through his mouth to avoid smelling it.\nA painful headache formed over the course of the hour.\nAlex felt like his stomach was churning.\n'I've done what I needed to do.'\nAlex slowly opened his eyes and gazed at the body pieces surrounding his sled wagon.\nHe had done this a couple of times in the last hour.\nIt was like he was trying to confirm if all of this had really happened.\n'This could have been me,' Alex thought as he looked at one of the corpses.\nHowever, no matter how often Alex told himself these things, it was like something inside of him wasn't accepting his thoughts.\n'I did the right thing.'\n'If I had let them escape, they would have called stronger bandits.'\nHowever, as Alex had that thought, he realized something.\n'But then, why did I only kill the ones that carried Ice Wood?'\nAlex's insides shuddered.\n'I let the others escape.'\n'Stronger bandits will come either way.'\n'But then, why did I kill the others?'\n'They were already all retreating.'\n'Would some pieces of Ice Wood ruin my plan?'\nSilence.\nAlex looked at the pieces of Ice Wood that some corpses still held in their hands.\nAlex knew the answer.\n'Without killing at least one or two of them, the others wouldn't have retreated.'\n'Killing no one would have ended in my entire sled wagon being stolen.'\nSilence.\nAlex looked at the corpses.\n'Except for the first two, the other deaths were unnecessary.'\n'Their deaths don't change the outcome.'\nSilence.\n'I should have killed all of them,' Alex thought after a while.\n'If I had killed all of them, these deaths wouldn't have been worthless.'\n'I've forgotten the very lesson I have learned in the wilds.'\n'Either go all the way or retreat.'\n'I tried to have both things. I wanted to keep my belongings and remain safe, but I also didn't want to kill anyone.'\n'My indecisiveness has ended up with me getting neither of these two things. I've killed several people, and my safety isn't guaranteed.'\n'I should have killed all of them.'\nSilence.\nAs Alex arrived at that train of thought, his tense body slowly relaxed.\nHowever, his headache worsened.\n'I can't make that mistake again.'\nSilence.\nSuddenly, Alex's eyes shot open with a cold glint as he heard a very silent sound in the distance.\nBANG!\nThe sled wagon shook as Alex shot into the distance with all of his speed.\n\"Wait-\"\nSHING!\nTwo halves of a body fell to the ground.\nAlex looked at the corpse with narrowed eyes.\n'Black clothing made of leather, daggers, a crossbow, a hood.'\n'It's a bandit, but a stronger one. I felt a tinge of resistance from my sword.'\nAlex looked at his surroundings warily, but he didn't hear, see, or feel anyone else.\n'A scout.'\nAlex narrowed his eyes.\n'I can't commit the same mistake!'\nAlex slowly pulled his sword back and hid it and his arm behind his cloak. After that, he silently but swiftly moved along the surroundings of his clearing.\nAlex had stayed in the wild for a long time, and he had become excellent at moving silently.\nAlex moved around his clearing in a wide circle, never leaving his sled wagon for too long. He had to keep an eye on it.\nHowever, Alex didn't find a second bandit, even after searching for over five minutes.\nEventually, Alex returned to his sled wagon and sat down again.\nHe hoped that the night would be over soon.\nThe time passed in silence for Alex.\nThe only things keeping Alex company were his thoughts.\nMeanwhile, at a camp a couple of kilometers away, a middle-aged man with an eyepatch was glaring at a young man with unkempt, brown hair.\n\"He's most likely dead. So what?\" the man asked with an uncompromising tone.\n\"Ryan is our best scout!\" the young man shouted as he glared at the man. \"He went through worse things! I'm certain that he's still alive!\"\n\"Then why hasn't he returned yet?\" the man with the eyepatch asked with a solemn voice.\n\"I don't know!\" the young man shouted. \"However, I'm sure that he's still alive! That's why we have to check up on him!\"\n\"Don't be stupid,\" the older man snorted. \"You've been in my camp long enough. You should know how these things go. If he hasn't returned, he either left our group, or he's dead. Bandits don't get captured, and there are no powerful beasts around. Additionally, Ryan had no reason to leave us.\"\n\"He's dead. Get it through your head,\" the man with the eyepatch said with a serious tone.\nThe young man's fist shook violently in rage. \"Then, we have to take revenge!\"\nThe man with the eyepatch sneered at the young man. \"Revenge? Are you sure you're a real bandit? Since when do we take revenge?\"\n\"We're hoodlums!\" the man with the eyepatch said with a huff. \"We're criminals! We're traitors! All of us are only here to earn money for one reason or another. We're not a group of friends. We're not a family.\"\n\"We all have our own families, and we all need money. Some of us want it for our starving families, and some of us want it for ourselves. The reasons don't matter.\"\n\"We're only here for the money. That's it,\" the man with the eyepatch finished.\nThe young man gritted his teeth in anger. \"Then, let's do it for the money! That guy is carrying over a ton of Ice Wood! Isn't that worth taking a risk?\"\n\"Have your emotions blinded you to rationality?\" the man with the eyepatch asked with a narrowed eye.\n\"The beggars tried to rat him, and he killed nearly half of them.\"\n\"That shows that he's not a stranger to killing humans.\"\n\"Then, he killed our best scout, while he only had the job to scout. I know Ryan, and I know that he would have only scouted. He wouldn't have tried anything on his own. He's smarter than that.\"\n\"Yet, Ryan is dead. That means that the perception of our supposed victim is beyond impressive. Additionally, he managed to kill Ryan. Ryan's orders were to retreat at the first sign of danger, and he has plenty of tricks when it comes to running away.\"\n\"Ryan could only have been killed by someone that's far more powerful than him.\"\n\"Such a person can only be in the Late Soldier Stage or the Peak Soldier Stage. Even if we all attack at once, several of us will still die in the fight.\"\n\"And then what? We will have lost a significant chunk of our most experienced members for some Ice Wood.\"\n\"It's not worth it,\" the man with the eyepatch finished.\nHowever, the young man only grew angrier and more frustrated.\n\"Fine!\" he shouted. \"Then, I'll just do it myself!\"\nThe man turned around to leave the camp.\nPuchi!\nHowever, his feet stopped as a sword came out of his neck.\n\"I can't risk you exposing our location,\" the man with the eyepatch said with determination.\nSHING!\nThe bandit cut the head off and put his sword away.\nAn older person to the man's side only looked at the corpse with eyes filled with pity.\n\"Give Martha and Holly one gold each,\" the man said to the older man.\nThe older man nodded.\nMartha was the wife of Ryan, the dead scout, and Holly was the wife of the dead man on the ground.\n\"Give the families of the dead beggars ten silver each,\" the man added.\nThe older man nodded again and slowly left the camp.\nNow, the man with the eyepatch was left alone, and he released a deep breath.\n\"I can't risk the lives of our comrades,\" he silently said to himself.\n\"If we all die, all our families will starve.\"\n\"We can't take any risks.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 51 - Alex And Shang\nDawn arrived.\nAlex's mind was still going wild, even though several hours had already passed.\nAlex didn't come from this world.\nHe came from Earth.\nOn Earth, murder was not something common. Sure, the news constantly reported about murder, but how many people had actually met someone that knew someone that had been murdered?\nAlex was currently fighting with himself in his mind.\nThe bandits hadn't stopped, even after Alex had already cut off someone's arm.\nWas he supposed to just watch?\nAnd then what?\nAll his money would be taken away.\nHe had to kill them!\nThey wouldn't stop otherwise!\nBut that created another issue.\nAlex had killed more people than necessary to stop them.\nWhy?\nSo that the other bandits wouldn't think of him as a pushover.\nHowever, he hadn't killed all of them, which made the previous deaths unnecessary in his mind.\nIt was a complex maze of morality.\nWhen the first light of the day hit Alex's face, he absentmindedly jumped down from the sled wagon and looked at his surroundings.\nThe corpses were still there.\nThey had been frozen due to the cold, and nothing had moved in the last couple of hours.\nIt was like no time had passed.\nHowever, the change from darkness to light made it appear like a nightmare that had become reality.\nIt was all real.\nAlex didn't feel much when he saw all the corpses.\nHe wasn't sure what he should feel.\nHe just did whatever he had to do.\nAlex gathered the remaining Ice Wood in the surroundings and absentmindedly repaired the cage as well as he could.\nIt took him some minutes, but he managed to repair the cage somewhat. Alex knew how to make robes and how to create basic structures due to his long time in the wild.\nEventually, Alex grabbed the sled wagon and pulled it back to the street.\nA bit of snow had fallen in the night, but the temperature had already climbed above freezing again.\nThe snow would vanish in the next couple of hours.\nWithout thinking anything, Alex simply pulled the sled wagon forward.\nAll of Alex's actions just happened automatically.\nA couple hours later, the first carriages passed by Alex again.\nNearly all of them had seen the clearing of corpses. Alex hadn't pulled the sled wagon far when he had camped for the night, which meant that the corpses could be seen from the streets as long as someone inspected their surroundings carefully.\nWhen the carriages reached Alex, they immediately knew that it had been him.\nWhy?\nBecause, at the speed at which he was pulling his sled wagon, he couldn't have gone that far in only one day.\nThis meant that he had either started in the middle of the night, or he had started yesterday and camped for the night.\nSo, how did the owners react when they saw the perpetrator of the massacre?\n\"Hahaha! Good job, kid! Every dead bandit is one bandit less for us to worry about! Here, take this as a thank you!\"\nThe owner of the carriage had shouted these words while slowing down. Then, he took out ten silver coins and threw them towards Alex.\nAlex only looked at the coins in the dirt with an absent mind.\nThe merchant continued on his way after saying goodbye.\nAlex looked at the ten silver coins lying before him in the dirt.\nIt was a reward for killing the bandits.\nFor a while, Alex only looked at the coins.\nHe wasn't sure what he should think about this reward.\nHe had killed several normal humans that hadn't even been armed.\nThey hadn't even attacked him.\nThey had only gone after his sled wagon to get some Ice Wood they could sell.\nMany people on earth would think of Alex as being a coldhearted and greedy murderer. He had put a bit of his money above several human lives.\nIn a way, Alex knew why those people would think like that.\nFrom an outsider's perspective, one could really say that Alex had gone too far.\nYet, Alex had been in the middle of it.\nHe had done what he had believed to be right.\nAlex only looked at the coins.\nIn his mind, the coins were associated with the actions he had done.\nHe had killed several unarmed humans, and he was being rewarded for doing that.\nThe dirty silver coins didn't feel very appealing.\nSomething inside Alex told him that he shouldn't take that money.\nAlex would never accept this money.\nAlex had a certain sense of morale.\nHowever, Alex had died on Earth.\nAlex wouldn't accept the money…\nBut what about Shang?\nAlex remembered the time he had gone out to hunt his first Pest Cat.\nBack then, Alex had felt like he was leaving his old world behind.\nHe didn't remember the faces of his family anymore.\nHe didn't remember the voices of his family anymore.\nHe wasn't even sure how they would act or what they would think if they could see him right now.\nIt had been so long.\nAfter so long of staying alone, he felt like he truly was alone.\nDid he even have a family?\nWhy did it feel like Alex's family was a stranger's family?\nIt was like they weren't real.\nEven more, Alex wasn't even sure about his own name anymore.\nAfter several times of splitting headaches when Alex tried to remember his own name, he had started to feel aversion towards his old name.\nEvery time he thought about the fact that he still had an old name, he felt frustrated.\nEvery time his old name was about to appear, he would feel pain.\nAlex knew that the God was the actual reason for all of this, but feelings often didn't follow logic. Even though Alex knew that there was no reason to dislike his old name, his emotions still felt a strong feeling of dislike towards it.\nOne could liken this situation to an abused dog.\nThe owner of the dog would pay someone to abuse the dog every couple of days to train the dog to be wary of certain kinds of people.\nThe owner was the reason for the dog's pain.\nYet, the person that had been paid would be the full focus of the dog's anger.\nOf course, humans were more intelligent and more complex than dogs, but to a certain degree, emotions still followed these principles.\nAlex knew that there was nothing wrong with his name, but he disliked it because he associated it with agony.\nHe didn't want to feel agony.\nTogether with the disconnected feeling towards his old family, Alex felt like there was nothing connecting him to his previous life anymore.\nHe had no family.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ He had no friends.\nHe didn't even like Earth.\nEveryone just worked day-in and day-out.\nFor what?\nTo become old?\nAnd when they were old, what then?\nThey would only do what they wanted until they eventually died.\nAnd then?\nThen, they would be slowly forgotten.\nOver the course of time, no one would remember them.\nThey were born, did their work, had their children, and died.\nWhat's the point of all of this?\nHowever, in this world, Alex could reach true power.\nEven though Alex had gone through more pain in this world than in the other world, he still preferred this world over Earth.\nAfter some minutes, Alex slowly stepped forward.\nAnd then, Shang scooped up the coins.\nIt was money, and he needed money.\nShang wanted to become more powerful, and money would help him.\nAfter pocketing the money, Shang continued pulling the sled wagon down the road.\nFor some reason, the sled wagon felt lighter than before.",

      "content": "Chapter 52 - Ice Wood Origin\nShang continued down the street absentmindedly.\nAlex had died.\nIn fact, Alex had long been dead.\nIt had always been Shang that had existed in this world, and Shang realized that now.\nEarth didn't matter.\nEarth might as well not exist.\nEarth might as well be a fantasy.\nThey were memories of a time that had never happened.\nIt was nothing.\nShang wasn't sure what he was thinking about while he was pulling the sled wagon for several hours.\nHe only knew that he was thinking but not what.\nShang continued pulling the sled wagon, and it felt easier than before.\nIt was like a conflict inside him had vanished.\nGoing forward had become easier.\nShang's mind went back to the events from last night a couple times, but the emotions associated with the event became duller and more distant.\nThese things had only happened last night, but Shang felt like they had happened an eternity ago.\nMore merchants passed by Shang, and they all praised him for his actions. However, they didn't throw money at Shang like the first merchant.\nThey were only happy that there were fewer bandits now.\nShang only looked at the merchants with a distracted expression and only muttered a quiet thanks for their words.\nSome of the merchants wanted to start a conversation, but Shang always only gave one-word answers, which essentially made it impossible for a proper conversation to occur.\nAfter a day of pulling, Shang arrived at his destination.\nBlizzard's Edge.\nThe town was on top of a sizable hill, and it took up the entirety of it.\nThis town was definitely bigger than the Southern Wild.\nShang guessed that it was probably several kilometers wide, judging from what he was seeing.\nBy now, the weather had also changed.\nA moderately strong wind went across the land. It wasn't freezing, but only a bit chilly.\nThe Ice Mana in the surroundings had severely dipped in concentration, and a lot of Wind Mana had replaced it.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ 'I'm at the border between the Ice Wyvern Zone and the Storm Eagle Zone,' Shang thought.\nShang also saw something else of interest.\nA huge tower was in the middle of the town. It was still several kilometers away from Shang, but he could still see it due to its sheer size. It was probably several hundred meters tall and over a hundred meters wide.\nOn top of it, Shang could see several floating crystals of different colors. The crystals had different shades of blue and green.\nShang wasn't sure, but he believed he had also seen some humans standing near these crystals.\n'Mages, huh?' Shang thought.\nThe God had told Shang that his world was filled with Mages, but Shang hadn't seen many up to now. He had only seen Duke Whirlwind, the elder from the village, and a couple of Earth Mages in the Central Wild.\nThat was it.\nBut now, he was seeing the power of the Mages firsthand.\nThis tower was humongous and imposing. Additionally, Shang could feel that a lot of Ice Mana was floating around the tower. Sadly, Shang wasn't sure if the tower was absorbing the Ice Mana or giving it off.\n\"Your first time, huh?\"\nShang looked over at one of the guards, who looked at him with a smirk from the gates.\nShang nodded.\n\"I knew it. Everyone always looks at the Mana Austerum when they first come here,\" the guard said with a smirk.\n\"Mana Austerum?\" Shang asked as he looked at the tower again. \"What does it do?\"\n\"It absorbs and distills Elemental Mana,\" the guard explained. \"That Elemental Mana is then used for research purposes. I'm not sure what they're researching, but a lot of actual Mages come and go from the Mana Austerum. By the way, with actual Mages, I mean Mages in the Third Realm. Mages in the First Realm are only Apprentices, and the ones in the Second Realm are only Adepts.\"\n\"Only a Mage that reached the third Realm can truly be called a Mage.\"\nFor some seconds, Shang only looked at the distant Mana Austerum absentmindedly.\n\"Why are you telling me these things?\" Shang asked.\nFor a second, the guard was a bit taken aback by the question.\n\"You're a funny one,\" the guard answered with a smile. \"You will come here several times in the future. I only want to make it easier for you to acquaint yourself with the town.\"\nShang furrowed his brows.\n\"What do you mean with that I will come here several times in the future?\" he asked.\nThis confused the guard, and he raised an eyebrow. \"Aren't you the new Ice Wood delivery guy?\" he said, gesturing towards the sled wagon full of Ice Wood.\nShang shook his head. \"No, I'm on my way to Warrior's Paradise. All of this Ice Wood is for paying for my entrance exam for the academy.\"\nThe guard became even more surprised, but then, his expression became more serious.\n\"Where did you get all this Ice Wood from?\" the guard asked.\n\"What does it have to do with you?\" Shang asked back with an even voice.\n\"A lot,\" the guard said as he put his right hand to the wall behind him.\nKnock, knock, knock.\nThe guard knocked at the wall three times in a certain rhythm, and a couple of other guards appeared on top of the walls, crossbows in their hands.\nThey weren't targeting Shang with their crossbows, but they were showing him that they were ready for whatever he wanted to do.\n\"We have a business relationship with Coldew Village,\" the guard explained, \"and we can't allow anyone to endanger it.\"\nShang frowned. \"What? So I'm not allowed to sell Ice Wood?\" he asked.\n\"You can, but that's not the point,\" the guard answered as he came closer. \"The origin of your Ice Wood is the problem.\"\n\"So, where did that Ice Wood come from?\"\nShang looked at the guard and all the guards on the wall.\n\"From Coldew Village,\" Shang answered.\n\"And how did you acquire it?\" the guard asked.\n\"I dealt with a Peak Frozen Lake Stag that was consuming all the Ice Mana in the Ice Wood Trees. This sled wagon of Ice Wood is my reward,\" Shang explained.\nThe guard narrowed his eyes, but his expression didn't change for the reason one would assume.\nIn fact, the guard had become less suspicious of Shang.\nWhy?\nBecause Coldew Village wasn't allowed to sell their Ice Wood to anyone without consulting a representative from Blizzard's Edge first.\nIf Shang had said that he had bought this Ice Wood, the guards would know that he had stolen that.\nHowever, he said that it was payment for a service.\nThat wasn't against the rules.\n\"We'll have to verify your story,\" the guard said. \"For now, we would like to ask you to follow us into the town.\"\n\"How long will this take?\" Shang asked with furrowed brows.\n\"About four hours,\" the guard said.\n\"Four hours?\" Shang asked with genuine surprise. \"So fast? How?\"\n\"We'll tell you when the source of your Ice Wood has been confirmed,\" the guard said. \"For now, don't do anything reckless. Step away from the Sled Wagon and come closer to the gate.\"\n\"You don't have to worry.\"\n\"Everything will go down according to policy.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 53 - Gamble\nShang looked at the guard with narrowed eyes, and many thoughts immediately went through his mind.\nFirst of all, the guard wore a slightly different armor from the others, which meant that he had a higher standing.\nSecond, the guard had easily called the others on the wall.\nThird, he felt quite powerful.\nHowever, he didn't feel too powerful.\nShang had seen physical fighters in the Second Realm, but the guard didn't feel like he was in the Second Realm, which meant he was probably in the First Realm, the Soldier Stage.\nShang had seen the leading officer of the Central Wild, and that officer had been in the Second Realm, the General Stage.\nWas Blizzard's Edge weaker than the Central Wild?\nProbably not.\nJust based on the gigantic Mana Austerum, this town was probably even more important than the Central Wild.\nSo, what did that make this guard?\nHe was probably a sergeant or something akin to a supervisor.\nHe wasn't actually the true person in charge.\n\"I won't enter the town,\" Shang said with narrowed eyes.\nThe guard in front of Shang only huffed. \"You don't have a choice,\" he said.\n\"I do,\" Shang answered. \"I have the choice to remain outside. You have several crossbows pointed at me, and I can't flee. There should also be several more powerful soldiers in the town. Right now, it doesn't matter where I am. I can't flee anyway.\"\n\"You're right,\" the guard said with narrowed eyes. \"So, obediently enter the town. You said that you can't flee anyway.\"\n\"I want to stay out here,\" Shang said.\nThe guard raised his right hand, and the guards on the wall pointed their crossbows at Shang. \"You don't have a choice.\"\nThe atmosphere became tenser. Some carriages had already arrived, but when they saw the guards with their drawn crossbows, they decided to stop. They didn't want to get involved.\n\"I will stay out here,\" Shang answered slowly.\nThe guard's eyes narrowed.\n\"At this moment, it's not even clear if I am some sort of thief or not. I know I am innocent, and I don't need your approval for that.\"\n\"Are you willing to risk a battle for such an uncertainty?\" Shang slowly asked.\nThe guard only looked at Shang with narrowed eyes.\n\"If you don't comply, we don't need to investigate the source of the Ice Wood. Your resistance proves that your method of procuring the Ice Wood wasn't legal,\" the guard answered.\nWhen Shang heard that, a glimmer of light appeared in his eyes.\n\"Why are you threatening me with not investigating the issue?\" Shang asked. \"If you are so convinced of my guilt, what would even be the point of threatening me with not investigating this issue?\"\n\"Unless you think that I will be proven innocent.\"\n\"However, if that's the case, why would you want me inside the town that badly?\"\n\"Are you intending to do something that you shouldn't do?\"\n\"Preposterous!\" the guard shouted in rage. \"I am a law-abiding soldier, and a mere thief is not allowed to question my sense of justice!\"\n\"Then why do you want me inside the town so badly?\" Shang asked.\n\"It's standard protocol,\" the guard immediately answered with gritted teeth. \"Suspicious individuals have to be taken into custody.\"\n\"I am in custody right now,\" Shang answered. \"I can't possibly escape. We are both in agreement about this fact.\"\n\"So, what's the issue with remaining here?\"\nA tense silence arrived.\nShang was looking at the leading guard, while the leading guard glared at Shang.\nSeveral seconds passed.\nClank.\nShang and the guard glanced at the wall when they heard the sound of armor footsteps.\nOne of the guards on the wall had retrieved his crossbow and vanished behind the wall.\nHowever, the others remained without moving and kept targeting Shang.\nWhen the leading guard saw the leaving guard on the wall, he gritted his teeth violently.\n\"Fine,\" he said with annoyance. \"We can wait here. Hope you're happy.\"\nThe guard slowly lowered his right arm, and the other guards put their crossbows away.\nWhy had the leading guard suddenly relented?\nIt was because of the leaving guard on the wall.\nThe normal guards were not allowed to leave their posts without being dismissed.\nExcept for one reason.\nThey could leave their posts if they were about to report to someone of higher rank than the person they were currently under.\nThe leaving guard found all of this to be quite suspicious, and he decided to report to the actual officer about what was going on here.\nThe leading guard knew what had happened as soon as he saw the leaving guard.\nHe had some freedom in how to deal with prisoners, and he had made quite some money with some underhanded means, but if these actions came to light, he would be severely punished.\nAs soon as the guard on the wall had left, the leading guard knew that this opportunity to make some money had forever left.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang relaxed.\n\"Thanks,\" he said evenly.\nShang had expected that the guard would do something underhanded, which was why he had been so adamant about not leaving.\nHe had decided to gamble.\nOn what?\nOn the leading guard actually being smart.\nWhy smart?\nBecause, if the leading guard had ordered to attack someone who wasn't actively resisting and whose guilt wasn't even conclusive, he would have gotten into a lot of trouble.\nIf Shang had initialized the confrontation, the leading guard could have ordered an attack without any issues.\nHowever, Shang had only stood there and calmly argued.\nOf course, if Shang had been weaker, the leading guard could have simply knocked him out and taken him with him.\nSadly, Shang had felt quite powerful to the leading guard. On top of that, Shang had claimed that he had killed a Peak Frozen Lake Stag.\nKnocking out a normal human and taking them into custody was not considered a confrontation.\nA confrontation only counted as a confrontation if the other side could damage the resources of the guards.\nIn short, Shang could maybe injure or kill some guards before dying himself.\nHowever, that was already too dangerous.\nAs soon as an actual conflict broke out, the higher-ups would get involved and investigate what had happened.\nAfter all, several guards would have been injured or killed, and they had to find out why that happened so that the same thing wouldn't happen again in the future.\nWhen that happened, the higher-ups would investigate Shang's background and his claims.\nThen, if they found out that he was innocent, they would immediately become suspicious.\nWhy would an innocent individual attack the guards of a town? He hadn't done anything wrong, and attacking a force far more powerful than himself for no reason made no sense.\nThis would mean that something fishy had been going on.\nEven if all the guards lied perfectly to hide the issue, the higher-ups would still remain extremely suspicious of them.\nThe leading guard had known all of this.\nHe might be greedy, but he wasn't an idiot.\nAnd that's what Shang had been gambling on.\nIf the leading guard had been stupid, he would have simply declared that he would apprehend Shang due to several suspicions.\nA stupid leading guard would believe their authority to be without fail as long as they were in their territory.\nHowever, would a stupid person receive such authority?\nIn unimportant towns and villages, maybe, but here?\nBlizzard's Edge obviously was an important town, and the leading guard had already said that there were several Mages coming in and out of the town on a regular basis.\nIn the end, the leading guard knew his place.\nIf any of these Mages even had a slight suspicion of him, his higher-ups would thoroughly investigate him.\nThis town was filled with powerful and intelligent Mages.\nHe couldn't make a wrong step.\nYet, he had still managed to become a leading guard.\nThat meant that he couldn't have been stupid.\nAll of this had been Shang's conjecture, and he had hit the bullseye.\nOut here, the guard couldn't do anything to Shang. There were simply too many eyes on them.\nThe leading guard might have some accomplices in his squad, but he couldn't possibly have control over all the guards on the walls.\nEven more, under enough pressure, even his accomplices would crack and spill the beans.\nShang's gamble had paid off.\nEventually, the leading guard looked at one guard on the top of the wall. \"Investigate his story,\" he ordered.\nThe guard nodded in affirmation and left.\n\"That won't be necessary.\"\nWhen the leading guard heard that voice, his eyes narrowed.\nHowever, he made sure that the person that had spoken didn't see his current expression.",

      "content": "Chapter 54 - Officer\nShang looked up at the wall, and he saw the guards part so that someone else could step forward.\nIt was a woman with brown hair, fully clad in an impressive set of silver armor.\nShang's instincts immediately told him that he couldn't fight her.\nShe felt about as powerful as that one spider he had seen on his travels to the Southern Wild.\nShang immediately knew that she was in the Second Realm, the General Stage, and he also knew that she was the one in charge.\n\"I've already given the order to investigate everything,\" she proclaimed. \"It will only take around two hours.\"\nWhen Shang heard that it would only take two hours, his suspicion towards the leading guard increased even more.\nThe leading guard turned to the officer and saluted with a professional expression. \"Thank you, my lady,\" he said.\nThe officer looked at the leading guard with a suspicious expression. \"Why haven't you given the order earlier?\" she asked.\n\"Reporting to my lady, I have been busy with handling the suspicious individual. I wasn't able to give the order earlier,\" the leading guard explained.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The officer only looked at the leading guard with a suspicious expression.\n\"It has recently come to my attention that your living conditions are quite ostentatious for someone of your position,\" she commented.\n\"My lady, I have already informed the treasury investigators about the sizable farm my brother owns. The treasury department has already verified all the gold he has sent me and its origins.\"\n\"Additionally, my lady, I would humbly request that you don't bring up my personal life in front of my squad,\" the leading guard added.\nThe officer narrowed her eyes.\n\"I will keep that in mind,\" she said.\nShang immediately noticed some things.\nFirst of all, the officer was rather young. She was probably in her early twenties.\nSecond of all, she didn't hide her suspicion and hostility while talking to the leading guard.\nThird, the leading guard had correctly highlighted the issue of talking about this in public. Superiors were not supposed to humiliate their staff in front of others.\nWith these clues, Shang got the picture.\nThe officer knew that the leading guard was doing underhanded business, and she wanted to punish him for it.\nHowever, the leading guard was perfectly covering his tracks, not leaving any opening, which frustrated the officer.\nDue to her inexperience, her frustration got the better of her, and she wanted to punish the leading guard via a different method.\nHowever, the leading guard managed to turn things around to make her lose face in front of all her soldiers.\nShang also knew how the leading guard managed to explain his wealth.\n'He's money laundering,' Shang thought. 'He has a rich brother? Maybe, but what brother continually showers their sibling with so much wealth when the sibling already has quite a well-paying position?'\n'He's probably exchanging the ill-gotten gains via a middle-man with his brother, who then gifts the guard with gold.'\n'The higher-ups probably already know, but there are so many merchants traveling through this town that it's nearly impossible to investigate all of them.'\n'No wonder she's so frustrated,' Shang thought.\n\"I would like to file an official complaint,\" Shang shouted from below the wall.\nThe officer looked at Shang with interested eyes. \"What's your complaint?\" she asked.\n\"This guard has ordered his colleagues to point their crossbows at me without a justified reason. I wasn't resisting, and I hadn't even drawn my weapon. He drew his weapon first, while I have not shown any aggression,\" Shang explained.\nThe officer frowned.\nShe looked at the leading guard, whose expression hadn't changed.\n\"His suspicions were valid, and your guilt has not been cleared yet,\" the officer said. \"However, even if your guilt will be cleared, he has still acted according to policy.\"\n\"Suspicious individuals are to be brought to the barracks. You are technically already under arrest due to your inability to flee from us, but that can't be considered an official arrest. For an official arrest, you need to be brought to the barracks.\"\n\"Remaining outside under our surveillance is not a right, but a privilege. It is something we can grant, but it's not our obligation.\"\n\"He hasn't broken protocol, and he has acted correctly,\" she said.\nThere were no emotions in her voice.\n\"Fine,\" Shang said after some seconds.\nHe had expected that his complaint would go nowhere.\nBut if he had expected his complaint to go nowhere, why had he complained in the first place?\nBecause he wanted to make a good impression on the officer.\nWhy?\nBecause by showing his intention to help her, the officer might want to reciprocate. An officer of such an important town had to be quite a powerful and impressive individual.\nMaking a good impression on someone like that might prove to be a great help in the future.\nAdditionally, Shang allowed her to rectify her earlier blunder.\nShe had openly humiliated her employee, but now, she had defended him.\nShang only hoped that she realized all of this.\nShang waited for the next couple of minutes. The officer had already stepped down from the wall to arrive in front of the gates.\nThe leading guard only respectfully stood at the side.\nAn hour later, a guard exited the gates and respectfully delivered a piece of paper to the officer.\nThe officer read the contents of the letter and nodded.\n\"Your guilt has been cleared, Shang,\" she said.\nThe fact that she knew his name meant that they had truly investigated his background.\n\"Thank you,\" Shang answered evenly.\nThe officer nodded towards the other guards, and the guard went back to doing whatever they were doing.\n\"You may enter the town,\" the officer told Shang. \"However, I would ask you to follow me for a bit. There have been reports of bandit corpses from other visitors, and they suspect that you have been the one that dealt with them. We would like you to verify the identities of the bandits.\"\nThe memories of last night returned to Shang, and the faces of the dead bandits went through his mind.\n\"Do I have to?\" Shang asked.\n\"It's not mandatory,\" the officer explained. \"However, I would ask you to do so regardless. The families of the people deserve closure.\"\nShang looked into the eyes of the officer.\nHer eyes didn't speak of indifference or protocol but of a genuine desire for him to accept.\n\"Fine,\" Shang said.\n\"Thank you,\" the officer said politely. \"Please follow me.\"\nShang nodded and took hold of his sled wagon.\nThen, he walked after the officer while throwing a glance at the leading guard.\nThe leading guard acted like he hadn't seen the glance.\nThe gates of Blizzard's Edge opened, and Shang entered.\nAs soon as he went past the gate, Shang felt like the weather had changed.\nThere was no wind, and the temperature of the surroundings felt rather comfortable, a bit warm even.\nFor the first time, Shang also felt a complete absence of Ice Mana.\n\"The Mana Austerum absorbs Ice and Wind Mana in the winter and gives off a bit of Ice Mana in the summer to keep the weather comfortable for Blizzard's Edge's citizens,\" the officer explained.\nShang only nodded.\nFor some reason, he wasn't in the mood to talk.\nShang didn't know the reason.\nMaybe he still had some misgivings about his actions from last night, and the thought that he had to talk about last night again made him nervous?\nHe wasn't sure.\nThe town was surprisingly quiet.\nShang had expected the town to be louder, but there actually weren't many merchants on the streets.\nIn fact, there weren't even any stalls. There were only shops.\n\"These are the barracks,\" the officer said after walking for a while. \"You can put your sled wagon onto that spot there. Don't worry, no one is allowed to go there without the supervision of the goods' owner.\"\nShang nodded and pulled his sled wagon to the side. After that, he let go and followed the officer into the barracks.\nThey passed through a couple of hallways. The officer opened the door to a meeting room, and the two of them entered.\nThen, they sat down opposite of each other at the table in the middle of the room.\nThe officer looked at Shang with a serious expression.\n\"I've realized your intentions and what you were trying to do,\" she said with a calm voice. \"However, it's not your responsibility to deal with the problems of my unit. I would ask you not to involve yourself again. Do we understand each other?\"\nShang nodded. \"Fine, I won't do it again.\"\nThe officer nodded.\n\"Now, let's talk about these bandits,\" she said as she stood up. Then she walked over to a drawer and rifled through some paper.\nEventually, she came back with a stack of papers.\nShe moved the stack of papers towards Shang, and Shang looked at the piece of paper on the top.\nIt featured a drawn face of a young person. At the bottom of the piece of paper were unrecognizable symbols, but for some reason, Shang immediately knew what they meant.\n\"Missing.\"\nThese were posters of missing people.\nAnd the poster of the first missing person was one Shang recognized.\nIt was one of the men he had killed the night prior.",

Of course, there are still some that enjoy that lifestyle of freedom and doing whatever they want, but most of them don't want to deal with being hunted by society.\"\n\"However, the normal people often need money for multiple reasons. Some need to take care of their family. Some want to take care of their friends. Some need money to survive themselves.\"\n\"Others don't care about the money but want to do something else other than overtaking their family's business, shop, farm, or whatever. Some of them only want adventure. However, they all will run into the problem of money and power again.\"\n\"When you have power, making money is easy. When you don't have power, making money is difficult. However, to make money, you either need to be outstanding in a specific field or power, and to become powerful, you need money.\"\n\"You need medicine, tutoring, equipment, supplements, and many other things to become significantly more powerful than the average person.\"\n\"Most people can't step onto the path of power due to their minuscule finances.\"\n\"That's where the bandits come into play.\"\n\"They scout out these troubled individuals and entice them with resources. That's how they get their recruits.\"\n\"Of course, the bandits aren't directly handing them the resources to become powerful. What they do is to give them an opportunity to make big money, which would, in turn, allow them to start their journey to power.\"\n\"Nearly all recruits start with Rat Raids. That's when a group of normal people charges at something valuable and bank on the possibility that the owner of these things doesn't have the conviction to kill a bunch of unarmored, normal humans.\"\n\"These raids are called Rat Raids because, like rats, the group mindlessly charges forward to gorge themselves on wealth. They know that some of them will die, and they will most certainly get injured, but they are betting on the possibility that they won't be the ones that will get killed.\"\n\"After they plundered the valuables, the new recruits will give them to the bandits, who, in turn, will teach the recruits about training and how to become more powerful. They are also willing to trade in supplements and medicine for outstanding contributions.\"\nThe officer leaned forward and put her right index finger on the top missing poster.\n\"Most of these missing people should be recruits for the bandits,\" she said slowly as she looked into Shang's eyes. \"The bandits force them to abandon their old life for fear of someone leaking out their camps and locations. They can't allow any of these recruits to come into contact with their loved ones.\"\n\"They are only allowed to return when they have proven themselves.\"\n\"Most of them will never reach that stage.\"\nThe officer leaned back again.\n\"That's why I need you to identify them. Some of them are genuinely missing, and some of them are recruits. According to what I've heard, some of them have already died on your hands, and that's fine. Killing bandits is a good deed, even if they are unarmed.\"\n\"Killing the recruits of the bandits is like killing off the offspring of Pest Cats. They might not be a danger now, but they will become a danger in the future with certainty.\"\n\"So, please, tell me who you recognize,\" the officer said as she finished her explanation.\nThe officer's words entered Shang's mind.\nShe had said a lot, but Shang didn't agree with everything.\nShang didn't agree that one needed money to start their journey to power.\nShang didn't have any money.\nSure, he had received some things from the God, but the only thing of value had been his weapon.\nIf other humans wanted to become powerful without any money, they could just get some wood and some stones. With that, they could easily make some spears, which they could use to hunt animals like boars or wolves.\nWith these corpses, they could buy some basic survival gear, clothes, and maybe even a weapon.\nEven more, they wouldn't even need supplements or medicine at the beginning.\nShang had become quite powerful even before he had discovered the Earth Fruit Hedgehog's fruits.\nTraining, meditation, training, meditation, training, meditation.\nAfter a couple of weeks, the people would already be strong enough to take on the weakest beasts. Even more, they could also hunt more powerful animals, like tigers and bears.\nThe officer had said these words to explain the way the bandits worked to Shang. She wanted to tell him two things.\nFirst, he shouldn't feel guilty for killing them.\nSecond, they were still humans, and they still had families. They had their reasons to become bandits.\nHowever, the officer only accomplished the first thing.\nShang had seen an easier alternative to power and one that was less morally ambiguous.\nThese people had had the opportunity to choose that path.\nYet, they didn't.\nInstead of being courageous and putting their own life on the line in hunting and combat, they decided to gamble on their luck.\nThat path needed less hard work, and it didn't need the person to be courageous or confident.\nWhen Shang had seen the missing posters at the beginning, he had feared that the bandits had kidnapped these people and forced them to do these Rat Raids.\nThat had also been a major regret Shang had over the last night.\nHowever, it turned out that these bandits did these things voluntarily.\nIf they had had no other option, Shang could understand them.\nYet, they did have another option.\nThey simply didn't choose it.\nBecause of that, Shang's suppressed guilt was reduced by quite a bit.\nThe officer saw that Shang seemed to have relaxed, and she released a quiet sigh.\nIt seemed like her words had been effective.\nShang looked at the first missing poster and put it to the side.\n\"Dead,\" he said.\nThe officer took out a pen and a piece of paper to write down what Shang had said.\n\"What did he do? How did you act?\" she asked.\n\"He, with some others, broke the cage on my sled wagon. He was one of the ones that ran with my Ice Wood, and I killed him by diagonally bisecting his torso,\" Shang said emotionlessly.\nThe officer nodded. \"That was the right choice. Even if he was already running, his fate will deter others from doing the same thing again.\"\nShang looked at the next poster.\n\"Don't know her,\" he said as he put it to the other side.\n\"Don't know him.\"\n\"Bandit, but he escaped.\"\n\"What happened?\" the officer asked.\n\"He fled after I killed the first or second bandit. He had fled before he could steal any of my Ice Wood, which was why I spared him,\" Shang said.\nThe officer nodded and hid a smile. 'He isn't that coldblooded after all,' she thought.\nShang went over nearly 100 missing posters, and whenever he came to someone he recognized, he narrated his encounter with them.\nBy the end, over half an hour had passed, and the officer put the missing posters away in different stacks.\n\"Thank you for your cooperation,\" she said.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang nodded.\n\"Was that all?\" he asked.\nA conflicted expression appeared on the officer's face.\n\"Not entirely,\" she said.\n\"What else do you need?\" Shang asked.\n\"Well,\" she said with a bit of hesitation. \"You tried to help me earlier, and you have helped me a lot with these missing posters.\"\n\"So, I want to reward you.\"\nFor a second, Shang became suspicious of the officer's intention.\nHe wasn't suspecting her of wanting to hurt him but of flirting with him.\nShang had been with a couple of women on his life on Earth, and he wasn't a stranger to romance.\nShang looked into her eyes, but he didn't see any embarrassment, shyness, or interest. Her posture was straight, and she didn't show any nervous mannerisms.\nShang realized that she hesitated with these words not because of him but because of her position.\nShe was probably about to do something that was not normal for someone in her position.\n\"I'm listening,\" Shang said.",

      "content": "Chapter 56 - Reward\n\"You want to sell your Ice Wood to earn enough money to enter the Warrior's Academy, correct?\" the officer asked.\nShang nodded. \"That's my intention.\"\n\"You don't want to wait for the yearly exams, right?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"You do know that you need five gold for the exam?\"\n\"I know. From what I've heard, the Ice Wood I have should be enough.\"\nThe officer nodded. \"It should be enough, but there is one issue.\"\n\"Which is?\" Shang asked evenly.\n\"How good are you at bartering and negotiation?\" she asked.\nThis took Shang by surprise.\nHe hadn't even thought about that.\n\"I've never bartered in my life,\" Shang said.\nWhy would he need to barter? All the prices in the normal stores on Earth were standardized. Bartering only existed on TV and in pawnshops.\nThe officer nodded. \"That's the issue,\" she said. \"You're planning on selling your Ice Wood in Warrior's Paradise. However, no normal person will buy that much Ice Wood. Additionally, very few normal citizens are even interested in raw resources.\"\n\"This means that you have to sell it to a merchant wholesale, and merchants are very shrewd. If I already suspected that you're not good at bartering, the merchants will realize that with one glance.\"\n\"Even more, the merchants are not stupid. They will realize that you definitely are not a merchant but an aspiring warrior that wants to earn money. The merchants will quickly realize that the only reason why someone like you would travel so far with such a heavy load was to earn enough money to enter the Warrior's Academy.\"\n\"They know that you only need five gold. So, they will act like your load is worth six gold and will magnanimously tell you that they are willing to give you seven.\"\nShang listened to the officer's words, and he realized something.\nHe would have accepted that trade.\nAfter all, he would have gotten even more gold than he needed. Additionally, he couldn't be bothered to research everything and negotiate with several merchants.\nShang wasn't interested in being a merchant. As far as he knew, this would be the only time he would ever do something like this. The quicker he got this thing over with, the better.\n\"So, my Ice Wood is worth more than seven gold in terms of wholesale?\" Shang asked.\nThe officer nodded. \"Yes.\"\n\"How much?\" Shang asked.\n\"I'm not sure, but from what I've seen, seven gold should be too little for so much Ice Wood,\" she said.\n\"Hm,\" Shang said as he scratched his chin in thought.\n\"Now, let's come to what I want to offer you,\" the officer said.\nShang looked with interest at the officer.\n\"We have inspected your background and confirmed that your Ice Wood comes from an ethical source. You might not realize it, but the Mana Austerum burns through Ice Wood at terrifying speeds. That's also the reason why we monopolized Coldew Village's Ice Wood, but even that's not enough.\"\n\"The Mages in the Mana Austerum need even more Ice Wood, and they're buying it from the surrounding towns. However, the prices in these towns are much higher than the shipments we get from Coldew Village.\"\n\"In short, the Mana Austerum can never have enough Ice Wood.\"\nAt this point, the officer took out a new piece of paper, which had some fancy designs on the edges of the paper.\nThen, the officer wrote down some things with deliberate strokes. The way she had written when she had taken note of the things Shang had said previously and now was very different.\nAfter about a minute, she finished writing and took out a candle, which she quickly lighted.\nA bit later, she put the molten wax from the candle at the bottom right of the paper and stamped it.\nLastly, she pushed the paper to Shang.\n\"This is a certificate for the origin of your Ice Wood,\" the officer said. \"Go to the Mana Austerum and show this to the guards. If everything goes well, they should invite you inside.\"\nShang read through the paper.\nIt basically said how Shang had gotten the Ice Wood, but it also said that he was not one of the normal traders coming from Coldew Village.\n\"Officially, we only accept the official shipments from Coldew Village here directly since we can't be sure about the origins of other goods. However, since your background has been investigated, our reason for not accepting Ice Wood directly has been handled.\"\n\"However, it still isn't really official that you can sell it to the Mages directly. So, there's still some uncertainty.\"\nShang looked at the paper for a bit and then looked back at the officer.\n\"Speaking of, how did you investigate my background this quickly?\" he asked.\n\"Every town needs a Communication Crystal to be officially recognized as a town,\" the officer explained. \"We spent some Mana to contact the Central Wild, who then sent over an investigator to Coldew Village. They sent us the information, and that's how we investigated your background.\"\nShang remembered his journey to the Central Wild. It had taken him a couple of hours, but that was while pulling the heavy sled wagon. A warrior could probably run that distance in just a quarter of an hour.\nShang nodded and asked his next question. \"The Mages won't try to scam me?\" he asked.\nThe officer snorted at the word scam. \"They're genuine Mages. They can't be bothered to waste their time arguing. On top of that, gold has nearly no importance to them. They only want to finish these unimportant and bothersome things as quickly and directly as possible.\"\nShang nodded. \"Thank you. This means a lot to me,\" he said.\nThe officer nodded with a smile. \"No problem. You helped me, and I helped you. Also, I see no problem with helping one of my future juniors.\"\n\"Juniors?\" Shang asked, but he quickly realized what she meant. \"Are you part of the Warrior's Academy?\"\nShe nodded. \"I'm currently in the later years. At the moment, I'm out gaining practical experience for my future as an officer.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang blinked a couple of times. \"Aren't you already an officer?\" he asked.\n\"Not here,\" she said. \"I don't want to just be an officer in some random town. No, I want to join the Duke's official army as an officer.\"\nThe image of Duke Whirlwind shot through Shang's mind.\n\"Oh, that sounds nice,\" Shang said.\nThe two of them talked for a couple of minutes, now that official business was over.\nHowever, the conversation ended pretty quickly after she noticed that Shang wasn't talking very much.\nShe assumed that he was disinterested in the conversation and went back to work.\nIn a sense, she was right.\nShang had noticed that he had become more and more disinterested in mundane things, and he couldn't bring up the energy to fake enthusiasm for a topic that didn't interest him.\nSo, he mainly gave very short answers without adding a question, making the flow of the conversation a bit choppy.\n\"Anyway, we'll see each other again in the Warrior Academy,\" the officer said with a polite smile.\nShang also gave a polite smile. \"We will. I'm looking forward to seeing you again.\"\nThen, the two nodded at each other and parted ways.\nWhen Shang exited the building, he saw his sled wagon at the same place where he had left it.\nNothing was missing.\nThe Ice Mana also felt just as intense as previously.\nAfter going through some guards, Shang walked away with his sled wagon.\nFinding the Mana Austerum wasn't difficult since it was so humongous.\nA couple of minutes later, Shang saw a gate in the wall surrounding the Mana Austerum.\nThe two guards at the entrance noticed Shang, and one of them calmly walked over.\nWhen Shang felt the guard approach, his sense of danger activated.\nThis guard was even more powerful than the officer.\nIn fact, this guard reminded Shang of the people that had guarded Duke Whirlwind's garden.\nYet, this guard didn't wear any fancy armor, which meant that he was only a normal soldier.\nThis meant that the guard was probably a soldier in the Duke's actual army.\n\"We didn't expect an Ice Wood delivery so soon,\" the guard commented.\n\"I'm not an official trader of Coldew Village, but I have a document that should answer all your questions,\" Shang said as he handed over the document the officer had given him.\nThe guard furrowed his brows but took the document and read through it.\nAfter reading it, he looked to the side and scratched his chin in thought.",

      "content": "Chapter 57 - Sparren\nThe guard seemed to be thinking about how to proceed with this request.\nNormally, it was forbidden for them to accept any unofficial Ice Wood deliveries, but that was because of the possibility that it might have been unethically sourced.\nHowever, the guards now had a certificate in front of them that showed that this delivery came from an official source.\nYet, it was still forbidden.\nAfter a bit of thinking, the guard waved the other guard over.\nThe other guard looked at the first guard with a lifted eyebrow and walked over. The first guard handed the piece of paper to the second guard, and the second guard read it.\nAfter a bit of thinking, the second guard just shrugged. \"It's official, right? On top of that, it's probably cheaper than the Ice Wood from the towns. I say let Cindy decide,\" he said.\nThe first guard scratched his chin for a bit longer but nodded in the end. \"Sure, why not.\"\nThen, he turned to Shang and motioned for him to follow. \"We'll let you through, but the final decision is still up to the manager,\" he said.\nShang nodded. \"Thanks.\"\n\"No problem. We're only doing our job,\" the guard said.\nThe guards pushed the gate open, and Shang walked through it while pulling his sled wagon along with him. \"Where should I go?\" he asked.\n\"Through the main entrance. The reception isn't always manned, so you might need to wait for a bit. Just wait in the big empty hall until someone comes to receive you.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang nodded again and pulled the sled wagon towards the Mana Austerum.\nBANG!\nThe heavy gates closed behind Shang, and he was a bit surprised that the guards didn't follow him.\nHowever, that thought was quickly thrown out of the window.\n'There are several real Mages in this building. Security isn't an issue,' Shang thought.\nShang went through the entrance of the Mana Austerum and saw quite a big hall. It was probably over twenty meters long and just as wide. There were also several doors and gates of different sizes.\nShang looked around, and sure enough, there was no one here.\nSo, Shang just waited at the side of the hall.\nSilence.\nNo one arrived.\nShang just continued waiting.\nCreak!\nOne of the doors opened, and Shang looked over.\nAn old man with blue hair that was slowly transforming into grey hair walked through the door.\nWhen Shang saw the person, he immediately felt the whirlpool of Ice Mana swirling around the person.\nThis was obviously one of the Mages. His Mana pull wasn't as powerful as Duke Whirlwinds, but it was still very powerful.\nThe man noticed Shang.\nThen, the man nodded in greeting.\nShang nodded back.\nAnd the mage left through another door.\nMore waiting.\nCreak!\nOne of the other doors opened, and a young and beautiful woman with short, green hair walked into the hall. Shang guessed that she was probably either in her late teens or early twenties.\nShang didn't feel any Ice Mana swirl around her, but he felt the displacement of the Ice Mana in her surroundings. She was obviously also a Mage, but she wasn't a true Mage. She was probably an Adept, based on the feeling of danger emanating off her.\nWhen she entered the hall, her gaze immediately homed in on Shang, and a surprised expression appeared on her face.\n\"I didn't expect an Ice Wood delivery that soon,\" she said.\n\"Hello, my name's Shang, and I'm here to sell my Ice Wood to the Mana Austerum,\" Shang said. \"However, this is not an official delivery from Coldew Village.\"\nThe woman's eyebrows furrowed. \"We don't accept independent Ice Wood deliveries. Didn't the guards inform you about that?\" she said with annoyance.\nShang took out the certificate and presented it to her. \"They did, but I have a certificate from the officer stationed on the northwestern gate which says that my Ice Wood has been ethically sourced.\"\nThe woman looked with skepticism at the piece of paper and grabbed it.\nThen, she read through it in a second.\nAfter that, she furrowed her brows and remained silent for a while.\nSome seconds later, she seemed to have come to a decision. \"Wait here for a second.\"\nShang only nodded.\nThen, the woman left the hall with the certificate.\nSilence.\nSome seconds later, she returned, but she didn't step into the hall. \"We'll accept your Ice Wood,\" she said. \"Please follow me with your Ice Wood.\"\nShang released a sigh of relief when he heard that he finally had the official okay to sell his Ice Wood.\nHe no longer needed to pull it to Warrior's Paradise.\nShang nodded and followed the woman with his sled wagon.\nAfter going through a hallway, the two entered a nearly empty warehouse. Shang could only see a couple of logs of Ice Wood stacked on the shelves.\n\"Please put your Ice Wood on this space here,\" she said as she gestured to a marked spot on the ground.\nShang nodded and pulled the sled wagon over.\n\"Without the sled wagon, please,\" she said.\n\"The sled wagon is also made of Ice Wood,\" Shang answered.\nThat took the woman by surprise.\nShe looked with skepticism at the sled wagon. Why would anyone use Ice Wood to make a mere sled wagon?\nSHING!\nShang's eyes widened as he saw a silver needle appear in the woman's hands.\nThat needle hadn't been there before!\nWhere did it come from?\n\"Space Ring,\" she said as she saw Shang's shocked expression. \"Very expensive. It isn't actually mine, but part of my working equipment.\"\n\"Space Ring?\" Shang asked.\nThe woman walked over and put the tip of the needle on the Ice Wood. At the same time, she showed her Space Ring with her other hand.\nIt was completely silver, and a small, grey gem was embedded on the top.\n\"The gem on the top is a hollowed-out Sparren, a gem that has an innate affinity towards space itself. They are very rare and very valuable,\" she explained.\nBy now, the needle had turned a light blue, and the woman moved the needle away from the Ice Wood while watching it.\nA bit later, the needle was losing its blue color.\n\"After finding a Sparren, it must be hollowed out by a true Mage with a Metal Affinity. It is delicate work, and one mistake makes the Sparren worthless.\"\nThen, she moved the needle towards one of the wheels of the sled wagon.\n\"Then, a true Mage with a Lightning Affinity has to carve a Magic Array on the inside of the Sparren, isolating the inner space from the outer space.\"\nBy now, the needle had turned blue again, and she nodded.\n\"After that, a true Mage with an Earth Affinity needs to compress the space inside the Sparren. The Earth Affinity has a close relationship with gravity, and gravity warps space. Just like with the previous steps, if the Mage screws up, the Sparren becomes worthless,\" she said as she put the needle away.\nThen, she gestured for Shang to push the sled wagon onto the marked spot, and Shang did so.\n\"The last step is to create an elemental shell around the inner walls of the Sparren. The Magic Arrays on the Sparren are very delicate, and without this shell, any rough movements outside the Sparren will make the items inside the Sparren bounce around and destroy the Magic Arrays.\"\n\"Additionally, contradicting Elements can cause the shell to break down, essentially destroying the Space Ring. Because of that, it's necessary to plan about what you want to store inside the Space Ring. Basically any Element can create an elemental shell inside the Sparren, but you have to be conscientious about what you place inside it.\"\nShe showed her Space Ring again.\n\"If I store any items with Fire Mana or Water Mana inside this Space Ring, it will be ruined by the end of the day,\" she finished. \"After all, this Space Ring has been created with Metal and Earth in mind. Storing Ice-related items is somewhat okay, but the Ice Mana shouldn't be too strong.\"\nThen, she looked at the Sled Wagon at the center of the marked area and took out some blue stones.\nShe put the blue stones into a small opening on the ground.\nThen, the markings on the ground lit up.",

      "content": "Chapter 58 - Money!\nAfter a short moment, the markings on the ground darkened again, and the stones had vanished.\nA new marking appeared on the ground, and Shang realized that it was the writing of this world. Just like before, Shang had no issues in reading it.\n'1,853.547kg,' Shang read with surprise. 'It's a scale?'\nShang looked with surprise at the markings on the ground. 'This elaborate thing is nothing but an industrial-sized scale?'\n'Just use counterweights or something. You don't need a huge Magic Array just to weigh something!' Shang thought.\nHowever, he didn't speak his mind.\nMaybe they had a good reason for doing it this way.\nShang had already expected that this world wasn't as technologically advanced as Earth, but he refused to believe that this world didn't even know how to make a basic scale. Even the ancient Greeks had scales!\nThis meant that they had to have a different reason to use a Magic Array.\n\"That's quite a lot of Ice Wood,\" the woman said as she wrote down the number on a piece of paper.\n\"By the way,\" Shang interjected. \"How do you know so much about Space Rings? What you told me didn't sound like common knowledge.\"\nShe was a bit surprised when Shang asked this question. \"I want to learn how to create an elemental shell inside a Sparren. I have a Wind Affinity, and Space Rings with a wind shell are rarely needed. After all, you can basically only store wind-related stuff in a Space Ring with a wind shell based on the wind's lack of stability.\"\n\"However, because these kinds of Space Rings are so rarely needed, they go for a lot of money. There are also not many Wind Mages that bother to learn about that skill due to the lack of demand.\"\n\"But that just means that the few that know how to do it are in high demand due to their rarity. It's risky to invest so much money into learning this skill, but if it pays off, I don't have to worry about the resources I would need to become a High Mage,\" she explained.\nShang nodded. \"That makes sense,\" he said.\nShe nodded again and took out a white crystal from her Space Ring. \"Hello sir, this is Cindy,\" she spoke politely to the crystal. \"We have just received a delivery of Ice Wood. Could you spare some time to evaluate its purity?\"\nShang had already guessed that this white crystal was a Communication Crystal. The officer in the barracks had told him how they had contacted the Central Wild.\nShang heard an annoyed groan come from the crystal. \"Fine. I'll come,\" a male voice came out of the crystal.\n\"Thank you very much,\" Cindy said.\nThen, she put the Communication Crystal away again.\nAfter that, the two of them simply waited for a couple of seconds.\nCreak!\nOne of the doors on the side opened, and a man in his thirties walked through them with lazy steps. He had icy blue hair and a pair of glasses.\nWhen Shang saw the glasses, one of his eyebrows rose in skepticism.\nHe doubted that Mages had issues with their vision.\nSo, why was he wearing glasses?\nThe man didn't even look at Cindy or Shang and directly focused on the sled wagon. He moved one of his fingers to his glasses, but he stopped suddenly.\nThen, he looked with a confused look at the sled wagon for a second.\n\"Who makes carriages out of Ice Wood?\" he muttered to himself.\n\"Sir, it's a sled wagon,\" Cindy said politely.\n\"Yes, yes, a sled wagon,\" the man said without any enthusiasm. Obviously, he didn't care.\nThe man moved one of his fingers to his glasses again.\nA moment later, Shang felt Ice Mana appear on the Mage's fingers, but the Ice Mana was quickly absorbed by the glasses.\n\"Nearly grade eight, but still grade seven. Just give them 50% more of what we would pay for grade seven,\" the man said.\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Cindy said politely.\nThe man nodded at Cindy and left again.\nThe entire time, the Mage hadn't even thrown a glance at Shang. He also hadn't asked about the Ice Wood's source or anything similar.\nHe only came, graded the Ice Wood, and left.\nWhen Shang had heard the evaluation of the Mage, he realized something.\nShang's mind went back to the time he had slid down the long slope with his sled wagon. Back then, Shang had absorbed some of the Ice Mana in the Ice Wood to survive his crash.\nHad that maneuver dropped the purity of the Ice Wood?\nIf he hadn't done that, would he have had grade eight Ice Wood?\n\"How much more is grade eight Ice Wood worth in comparison to grade seven?\" Shang asked.\n\"Double,\" Cindy answered immediately.\nWhen Shang heard that, he had to release a helpless sigh.\nShang had obviously received grade eight Ice Wood, but his maneuver had dropped it to the peak of grade seven.\nSure, Shang would get 50% more than for normal grade seven Ice Wood, but that was only 75% of what it should be.\nThat stupid idea had cost Shang 25% of his earnings.\n'I shouldn't have done that,' Shang thought.\n\"You heard him,\" Cindy said. \"Please follow me. You can leave your sled wagon there. Someone else will deal with it later.\"\nShang released another sigh of helplessness and followed Cindy.\nThe two of them walked back to the entrance hall, and Cindy went behind a desk. Then, she opened a drawer and riffled through some papers.\n\"At the moment, 100kg of grade seven Ice Wood are equal to 0.97 gold. 1853kg of Ice Wood are about equal to 19,1 gold. Half of that more is 28,65 gold. Let's just make it 29 gold. Are you okay with the price?\" Cindy asked as she looked at Shang.\nAt the moment, Shang was dumbstruck.\n29 gold?\nThat was way more than he had thought!\nShang had expected that he would get ten gold, at most!\nAs said previously, Shang would have even accepted a trade for seven or eight gold.\nAnd now, he would get 29 gold?!\nHe only needed five!\nShang's mind immediately went back to the three people that had been responsible for him receiving such a huge sum of money.\nThe first person was the guard in Duke Whirlwind's garden. He had told Shang how to earn some money. Without him, Shang wouldn't have even asked for Ice Wood in Coldew Village.\nThe second person had been the Elder in Coldew Village. He had given Shang the Ice Wood, and he was probably also responsible for Shang getting so much of it. On top of that, he had given Shang Ice Wood of relatively high purity.\nThe last person was the officer in the northwest of Blizzard's Edge. Without her, Shang would have sold his Ice Wood in Warrior's Paradise, and he would have only made around seven gold.\nAll of them had contributed to Shang getting such a huge sum of money.\n\"Do you accept the price?\" Cindy repeated.\nThat took Shang out of his thoughts, and he quickly nodded. \"Yes, of course,\" he said faster than normal.\nCindy nodded and took out a sizable sack of gold. She poured a lot of gold on the table and counted in front of Shang. After counting out the 29 pieces, she shoved the remaining pieces back into the bag and put it into her Space Ring.\nThen, she summoned another tiny bag, but this one was empty. After pouring the gold into the small bag, she pulled it shut and pushed it towards Shang.\n\"Thank you for doing business with us,\" she said with a polite smile.\nShang only nodded, also smiling. \"No, thank you!\" he said.\n\"Alright, I have to get back to work. Do come back again,\" Cindy said as she stood up.\nShang also stood up.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Then, the two of them exchanged some goodbyes, and Shang left.\nAfter he left the Mana Austerum, he thanked the two guards again, who only responded that it was their job.\nShang left the vicinity of the Mana Austerum, and he paused.\nThen, he looked at the heavy bag of gold in his hand.\nThis bag of gold represented Shang's future.\nWith this bag of gold, he could join the Warrior Academy.\nShang's grip around the bag tightened, and a newfound conviction shone in his eyes.\nNext stop, Warrior's Paradise!",

      "content": "Chapter 59 - Farm Line\nShang left the Mana Austerum and blankly walked along the street.\nShang constantly felt like he forgot his sled-wagon, but he always got reminded that he didn't own the sled-wagon anymore.\nIt was so weird.\nHe had traveled with that thing for nearly a week, and he had traveled across a large distance.\nFrom the northwestern third of the Ice Wyvern Zone, Shang had pulled the sled-wagon all the way to the southeastern end of the Zone.\nBut now, he didn't need it anymore.\nAnd in exchange?\n29 pieces of gold!\nGetting that sled-wagon to here had been a major pain in the ass, but it had been worth it!\n29 gold!\nShang could probably buy some incredible things for such an amount of money!\nAnd now, Shang didn't even need to pull the heavy sled-wagon along anymore!\nHe could finally travel without any restrictions!\nShang put the bag of gold beneath his coat and fastened it securely. Then, he walked to the southeastern gate and asked the guard for directions to Warrior's Paradise.\n\"We are currently at the northwestern edge of the Storm Eagle Zone,\" one of the guards told Shang as he gestured towards the southeast. \"Follow this road until you reach a vast landscape filled with farms. That's when you've reached the safest part in the Storm Eagle Zone, the Farm Line.\"\n\"Farm Line?\" Shang asked.\n\"Yes. The Farm Line is, as the name suggests, a huge line of farms. You could also call it a big territory for agriculture. That's where all the food and basic resources for Warrior's Paradise are produced. Warrior's Paradise is gigantic, and it burns through resources like crazy, which is why it needs a huge area dedicated to nothing but farming.\"\n\"As long as you keep following the path, you will reach the Farm Line. When you get there, you only need to continue walking. The direction you walk towards isn't actually important.\"\nThis confused Shang. \"How is it not important?\" he asked.\n\"Because a ridiculous number of guards and soldiers are constantly patrolling the Farm Line. The Farm Line is the lifeline of Warrior's Paradise, and the city can't afford to let anything interfere with the farmers. Because of that, bandits and wild beast essentially don't exist there.\"\n\"As soon as you walk into the Farm Line, you are sure to meet some guards very quickly, who will then instruct you on how to proceed. If you have any valuables, you must have some sort of receipt for them. Vast quantities of wealth are very suspicious.\"\nThis made Shang frown, and he took out his bag of gold.\nWhen the guard saw the bag, he whistled. \"That's quite some money you got there, boy,\" he said.\nShang only nodded and looked into the bag.\nSure enough, just as he had suspected, a small piece of paper was inside the bag, stating that Shang had exchanged the gold with the mages and that this gold belonged to him.\nShang had already anticipated that the manager had put something into the bag. After all, she had probably also guessed that Shang would go to Warrior's Paradise.\n\"Is that enough?\" Shang asked as he showed the piece of paper to the guard.\nThe guard squinted at the piece of paper and nodded. \"Yep. It has the official seal on it.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Shang said as he put everything away again. \"How far to Warrior's Paradise? Can I get there by the end of the day?\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The guard looked at the sky to judge the time.\nIt was late afternoon.\n\"Can I test your body's power?\" the guard asked.\nShang only raised an eyebrow. \"Sure.\"\nThe guard lifted his spear and moved the butt of the spear slowly towards Shang's shoulder.\nThen, he pushed a bit.\nShang automatically pushed back, and the soldier nodded as he took his spear back. \"Should be enough. You will probably reach the Farm Line by the evening, and if nothing interferes, Warrior's Paradise by nightfall.\"\n\"That doesn't sound very far,\" Shang commented.\n\"It isn't,\" the guard answered. \"Warrior's Paradise isn't in the middle of the Storm Eagle Zone but slightly in the north. The Farm Line takes up the remainder of the north.\"\n\"And the other parts of Storm Eagle Zone?\" Shang asked.\nThe guard only smirked.\n\"Death.\"\nShang raised an eyebrow. \"Death?\"\n\"Yep, death,\" the guard said. \"If you see any signs of beasts, you know that you walked in a wrong direction. When you see the first beast, you should still be safe with your power, but you shouldn't go further into the wilderness. The power of the beasts just keeps escalating to a degree where even our Duke has to watch where he's going.\"\n\"The Duke?\" Shang asked with shock.\nAccording to what Shang had seen, the unimaginably powerful octopus and hedgehog had been nothing more than pets to the Duke. These two beasts were so powerful that Shang couldn't even attempt to resist them, and the Duke was even more powerful.\nYet, there were beasts in that place that were as powerful or even more powerful than the Duke?\nThat was amazing and terrifying at the same time!\n\"Then, why is there such a big city there?\" Shang asked.\n\"Money,\" the guard answered with a smirk. \"Strong beasts give strong materials for strong people. Warrior's Paradise is exporting a large quantity of high-end materials, making it one of the richest places in the world.\"\n\"Anyway, you should go. I also have to work, you know?\" the guard said.\nShang nodded. \"Thanks for all the information.\"\nThe guard also nodded.\nShang went past the gate and checked all of his belongings again.\nGold? Check.\nClothing? Check.\nSword? Check.\nEverything was in order.\nThen, Shang stretched his muscles for a bit.\nLastly…\nBANG!\nThe ground under Shang let out a slight vibration as he charged forward. By now, Shang couldn't see any snow anymore, and everything looked rather dusty and desolate. One could almost call this part a wasteland.\nShang guessed that the main reason for this desolation was the Mana Austerum. The Mana Austerum probably ate up a lot of humidity by absorbing the Ice Mana, leaving the surroundings empty.\nAs Shang charged forward, he felt the power of the wind.\nShang got reminded of the time he had charged down the mountain after leaving the Duke's garden.\nNo sled-wagon.\nNo worries.\nHe could just run.\nHis future was in front of him!\nShang passed several merchants on his way with a grin. He had always been the one that had been overtaken by merchants.\nNow, he was overtaking them.\nAfter just 30 minutes, Shang saw the first flowers and trees.\nTen minutes later, Shang saw far more trees, and he could even see the occasional small forest.\nTwenty minutes later, Shang saw the first building. It was a simple woodworking shop close to the woods. Shang could hear the sound of sawing coming from the shop.\nAs Shang stopped to look at the woodworking shop, he noticed that the wind had picked up. Shang guessed that the wind had reached a speed of about 20 kph by now. Not a storm, but still very noticeable.\nShang continued running, and ten minutes later, the trees slowly started to vanish. What replaced them were huge farms filled with wheat and all kinds of useful plants.\nThere were also several strong animals pulling carts, some of which Shang had never seen before.\nThere was even a two-meter-tall dog walking along the fields, and when Shang saw the dog, he felt a shudder.\nThat dog was powerful!\nIt was probably in the General Stage, which was the Second Realm, and it definitely wasn't in the earlier levels of that Realm.\nThe big dog looked at Shang for a bit but looked away again in disinterest.\nIt obviously wasn't there to keep watch over humans.\n\"Is this your first time seeing the Farm Dogs?\"\nShang jumped to the side in shock as he heard a voice come from his right.\nShang looked over, and he saw a man in brownish-black clothing standing beside him. The clothing perfectly made him blend into the environment.\nAdditionally, that man also felt far too powerful to Shang.\nShang hadn't even noticed the guy!\n\"Sorry,\" the guy said with an awkward smile. \"I'm one of the scouts. Didn't mean to startle you.\"\nShang calmed down again and released a deep breath. \"It's okay. I'm here to join the Warrior Academy.\"\n\"Oh, I thought as much, based on how fast you moved just now,\" the scout said with a chuckle. \"I'm basically done with my work anyway, and my home is in Warrior's Paradise. I can show you the way.\"\nShang nodded. \"Thanks.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 60 - Storm Eagle Zone\nShang nodded. \"Thanks.\"\n\"Just wait for a bit. My replacement should be here pretty soon. Aaaaaand, he's here!\" the scout said with a smirk. \"Punctual as always.\"\nShang looked around, but he couldn't see the other guy.\nThe scout saw Shang's confused expression and chuckled a bit. Then, he showed his wrist to Shang. Shang could see a small device attached to the scout's wrist. It looked almost like a wristwatch.\n\"It's this thing. It's been created by Mages, and it keeps us all informed. I just got informed that my shift ended. Let's go,\" the scout said as he gestured to the front.\nShang nodded.\nThen, the guard shot forward, and Shang followed him. They weren't sprinting or running, but jogging comfortably, which was still very fast compared to normal humans.\nWhile jogging, Shang kept looking at the Farm Line. \"What are these dogs?\" he asked.\n\"The Farm Dogs?\" the scout asked. \"They are there to deal with rogue beasts and Pest Cats. If they see any beast that isn't accompanied by a human, they will kill that beast.\"\nShang nodded. That made sense.\n\"Do these dogs have affinities?\" he asked. After all, Shang had seen plenty of beasts with Elemental Affinities.\n\"Most of them are Wind or Earth,\" the scout answered. \"The ones with Wind Affinities deal with Pest Cats and weaker beasts. If a powerful beast arrives, the dogs work together to bring it down. Basically any beast that comes here will be killed as long as it's below the Commander Stage.\"\nShang nodded. The Commander Stage was the Third Realm, which was the Realm the hedgehog had been in. If the hedgehog came here, it could probably kill every dog with one needle each.\nAs the two of them kept running, one of the dogs suddenly barreled towards them at a much faster speed.\nShang looked over nervously, but the scout only smiled at the dog.\nThe dog ran circles around them while they were still running with incredible speed, and the scout extended his hand.\nThe dog quickly stopped and let the scout scratch it behind the ear. Usually, a human wouldn't even reach such a high place, but the dog was lowering its head with happiness.\nShang only smiled. 'Well, some things don't change, even if we are in different worlds.'\nAfter a bit, the dog ran away again to get back to its place of work.\n\"Don't try to do the same thing,\" the scout said. \"The dogs know me, but they don't know you. They are used to killing, and it's dangerous to interact with them without supervision.\"\nShang nodded.\nThe two of them continued running for another twenty minutes.\nBy now, Shang couldn't see any farms anymore, which meant that they had left the Farm Line. Instead, Shang could see thick forests a couple of kilometers away from the main road.\n\"This is the Wild Forest,\" the scout explained. \"The streets are safe since the dogs and guards also patrol here, but the Wild Forest is filled with beasts. The beasts in the Wild Forest are only at the Soldier Stage, but if you stray too far, you will eventually reach the Wasteland.\"\n\"Behind the Wild Forest, the wind becomes so strong that only very few plants can grow there, making it a wasteland. That's the Wasteland, obviously, and the Wind Mana is so strong there that you can basically only find beasts at the General Stage.\"\nThe scout chuckled. \"Us soldiers don't call it the Wasteland but the Workland since most of our work is being done there.\"\nShang listened with interest. \"You hunt wild Beasts? Isn't that more of a job for hunters?\"\n\"Oh yeah, definitely,\" the scout answered. \"However, we don't always get enough hunters to take care of the wild Beasts. Sometimes, all the good hunters finish at the same time and go to sell their wares, leaving for a couple of days. Sometimes, a couple of tricky and troublesome Beasts appear.\"\n\"When that happens, we soldiers have to fulfill the quota for hunted Beasts. If we don't regularly kill enough Beasts, they will become so numerous that the Wasteland won't have enough space left for them, which forces them out of the Wasteland and into the Wild Forest and human territories.\"\nShang nodded. \"What about-\"\n\"Wait a sec,\" the scout suddenly interrupted Shang as he stopped.\nThen, the guard quickly took out a folded bow and expanded it to its true form. In one fluid motion, the scout took out an arrow and shot it towards the right side.\nBANG!\nShang looked over, and his eyes widened.\nShang saw a Pest Cat that had been nailed to a tree by an arrow just two kilometers away!\n\"What was your question?\" the scout asked as he put the bow away again.\nShang was a bit absentminded.\nThat had been way too fast!\nThe guy had killed a Pest Cat in one or two seconds from two kilometers away!\nShang got reminded of the guards in Duke Whirlwind's garden. They had been about as powerful as this guard, and they had pointed their crossbows and bows at Shang.\nIf Shang had acted incorrectly back then, this Pest Cat could have been him.\nHe couldn't evade something like that!\n\"That's a Wind Bow,\" the scout said when he saw that Shang still didn't speak. \"I can't shoot such an arrow without its help. If I used a normal bow, my arrow would only fly at half the speed.\"\n\"Does everyone get such a bow?\" Shang asked.\n\"The scouts do. After all, it's our job to take out troublesome beasts. I usually don't deal with weaker beasts, but Pest Cats are an exception. They simply multiply too quickly, and they are everywhere.\"\nShang nodded.\nThat arrow had definitely been impressive.\n\"What I wanted to ask earlier, what's beyond the Wasteland?\" Shang asked.\n\"Oh?\" the scout uttered. \"You do know more than I thought. Why do you think there is an after?\"\n\"One of the guards in Blizzard's Edge said that the strength of the beasts keeps escalating until even the Duke has to be careful.\"\nWhen the scout heard that, he chuckled. \"A funny way to put it, but yes, he's right.\"\n\"Beyond the Wasteland is the Canyon. The wind there is so powerful that it ravages the land and creates powerful wind tunnels. You can only find beasts there that can completely live off Mana. That means that all beasts there are at the Commander Stage or higher.\"\n\"If you go even further, you find the Crater. Only the most powerful beasts with Wind Affinities live there, and they are as powerful as our Duke and the Headmaster of the Warrior's Academy.\"\n\"In the center of the Crater, you can find the most powerful beast, the actual Storm Eagle, the beast this zone is named after and the source of all the Wind Mana. No human in the world can take down that beast,\" the scout explained.\n\"No human in the world?\" Shang asked in surprise.\nThe scout nodded. \"The strongest people in the world are the different Kings. They are the only Archmages in existence, but even they are helpless in front of the Storm Eagle. Even among Zone Beasts, the Storm Eagle is one of the more powerful ones.\"\n\"Then, what stops the Storm Eagle from just razing us to the ground?\" Shang asked.\nThe guard chuckled a bit.\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"Nothing?\" Shang asked.\nThe scout nodded.\n\"If the Storm Eagle wanted to kill us, we could only run away and accept our fate. Luckily, it doesn't seem to be interested in us. Even when it flies over our city, it doesn't even look at us.\"\n\"It flies over the city?\" Shang asked in shock.\nThe scout nodded again. \"Does it all the time. It even lets its little chicks fly in the city.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang became shocked again and again. \"Chicks?\" he asked.\n\"Yeah, its little chicks fly and walk around in the city occasionally, and as soon as we get news of one, a squadron of guards is sent out to keep the chicks safe until they leave the city again. After all, we don't want to anger the Storm Eagle.\"\nShang asked more about Warrior's Paradise, and the scout kept answering Shang's questions.\nTwenty minutes later, the forests on the side of the road vanished, and Shang could see the ground vanishing. The road continued to go straight, but Shang felt like the road was climbing upwards.\nIn another ten minutes, the one-kilometer-wide road was the only visible piece of land, and everything around them had sunken into the earth.\nThe scout pulled Shang to the side of the road and pointed to the ground.\nShang could see a vast land nearly bereft of plants below them. He could also see over ten different beasts walking around and even fighting.\nAll of these beasts were more powerful than Shang.\n\"That's the Wasteland?\" Shang asked.\n\"That's the Wasteland,\" the scout answered. \"It angles downward until you reach the Canyon. It's currently dark now, but when it's bright, you can even see some huge pillar-like structures in the distance from here. That's where the Canyon begins.\"\n\"There are also more beasts walking around during the day. Right now, you can only see the beasts that are active during the twilight hours. Those are the weakest beasts, and they only come out when the strongest ones are still asleep or starting to rest.\"\n\"You can actually also see Warrior's Paradise from here. You just didn't pay any attention,\" the scout said with a smile as he pointed towards the end of the road.\nShang looked over, and his eyes widened.\nThis was Warrior's Paradise?",

      "content": "Chapter 61 - Affinities\nThe scout pointed towards the front, and Shang's eyes followed that direction.\nIt was already pretty dark outside, making it hard to see very far, but with Shang's improved vision and the lights inside the city, it wasn't very difficult to see it.\nIn the distance, Shang could see a gigantic fortress.\nThe walls were probably over 50 meters high, and Shang could see several towers with an even more imposing height. The walls and the towers were nearly invisible in the dead of night, and Shang guessed that they were probably dark grey or black in color.\nGigantic bonfires raged on top of every tower, illuminating the entire city.\nIt was absolutely massive!\nShang guessed that the city was several kilometers wide.\nHowever, all of that wasn't the most surprising and shocking part.\nThe most surprising part was the location of Warrior's Paradise.\nEarlier, Shang and the scout had already been walking on a road that seemingly rose into the air. The road was like the track of a rollercoaster, slowly extending further and further upward with nothing of similar height beside it.\nIf Shang walked to the side, he would be able to see the border between the Wild Forest and the Wasteland. While the road kept extending upward, the Wasteland kept going downward, expanding the difference in elevation between it and the road.\nSo, with a lonely road slowly extending towards the sky, where was Warrior's Paradise?\nWarrior's Paradise stood on one lonely, gigantic rock.\nThe walls perfectly aligned with the edges of the rock, making it seem like the walls were part of the gigantic rock.\nShang looked around, but he couldn't see any other similar rocks around.\nThis singular rock extended upward from the Wasteland for probably over two kilometers!\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Warrior's Paradise was like these ancient, European castles that had been built on the precipice of a cliff. However, in comparison to these castles, Warrior's Paradise was an actual city.\nTheir sizes couldn't be compared.\nA black, burning, solitary fortress that overlooked seemingly the entire world.\nIt was a monument to human power over nature.\nAnd this monument had been Shang's goal for such a long time!\nWarrior's Paradise!\nNow, Shang truly understood why it was called Warrior's Paradise.\nWarrior's Paradise was surrounded by nothing but wild nature with plenty of powerful natural forces and Beasts. If one were able to survive the fall, one could simply jump over the wall, and they would arrive in a land of slaughter in a minute.\nIt truly was a paradise for warriors.\n\"Impressive, isn't it?\" the scout said with a smile when he saw Shang's expression.\n\"Yes,\" Shang answered slowly.\nThe scout only chuckled a bit. \"Do you know how many citizens are in Warrior's Paradise?\" he asked.\nShang looked at the size of the city.\n\"Probably around 10,000 to 20,000,\" he said.\nThe scout only smiled.\n\"About 500.\"\nShang looked at the scout in surprise. \"What?\" he asked.\n\"There is limited space in Warrior's Paradise,\" the scout explained. \"The Warrior Academy takes up around 30% of the city. The citizens take up another 10%. Around 40% of the city is taken up by merchants and different businesses dealing with different crafts. The remaining 20% are for the soldiers.\"\n\"We have around 500 normal citizens living here, but during the day, around 20,000 people are inside Warrior's Paradise.\"\n\"In the early mornings, the farmers come to deliver their food. At the same time, over 2,000 hunters arrive in the city to register for their daily hunting activities. Many of the soldiers live with their families in the Farm Line, and they also arrive here early in the morning.\"\n\"Only very few rich citizens can afford to live in Warrior's Paradise. Everyone else only comes here to work and leaves again.\"\nAs Shang listened to these words, he noticed that Warrior's Paradise was very similar to a concept from Earth.\n'An industrial zone,' Shang thought. 'Nearly no one lives in an industrial zone, but everyone goes there to work during the day.'\n\"What about the students in the Warrior's Academy?\" Shang asked. \"Where do they live?\"\n\"Some of them live in the dormitories, and some of them live in lodgings in the Farm Line,\" the scout answered. \"Only a few of them live in the dormitories due to the cramped space and stale air. The walls block the violent wind from the surroundings, making the air inside Warrior's Paradise very stale. That's why most of them sleep in the lodgings in the Farm Line.\"\nShang nodded. \"Sounds like the roads are very busy during the day,\" he said as he looked at the empty road.\n\"Yep, that's why the road is so wide. It took a lot of money to widen the road to such a degree, but we no longer have traffic jams.\"\n'Traffic jams in a world with mages and warriors,' Shang thought. 'I guess some things never change.'\n\"Let's keep going. I want to get home before tomorrow,\" the scout said with a smirk.\n\"Sorry,\" Shang said before continuing to run forward with the scout.\n\"Are there Mages in Warrior's Paradise?\" Shang asked while running beside the scout.\n\"Of course,\" the scout said with a snort. \"Who do you think keeps the city from collapsing? We have around 50 actual Earth Mages in the city, who constantly keep watch over the stability. They are also responsible for expanding the city and for its development.\"\n'So, they're like urban planners or civil engineers,' Shang added in his mind.\n\"We also have the biggest Mana Austerum in the surrounding Zones. You can't see it right now since it's not illuminated, but in the day, you can see it. It's in the middle of the city, and it's the highest structure in all of it.\"\n\"The Mana Austerum catches all the Wind Mana and stores it into Wind Mana Magic Crystals. The Mana Austerum is also the biggest reason why the air inside Warrior's Paradise is so stale. Around 30 Wind Mages are in the Mana Austerum. They keep it running, and they research new applications for Wind Mana.\"\n\"The Farm Line has around ten Water Mages. Due to the wind and the dryness, the Farm Line doesn't get much natural rain. The Water Mages are there to keep everything nice and moist.\"\n\"We only have the occasional Fire Mage in the city. I think none of them actually live here, but you can see them from time to time.\"\n\"Ice Mages are very rare to begin with, and all the Ice Mages are more interested in Blizzard's Edge than Warrior's Paradise. I haven't seen one in a long time.\"\n\"Lightning Mages are just as rare, but I think we have two or three of them in the city. They mostly handle some Element-specific problems in the city related to lightning.\"\n\"We have about five Metal Mages. They are responsible for forging all the really expensive equipment for us soldiers. I don't get to interact with them since I'm still too weak, but all warriors in the Commander Stage have met them.\"\n\"And that's about it for the Mages. As you've heard, from the seven varieties of Mages, we have a lot of Earth, Wind, and Metal Mages. I think we have something like 100 Mages in the city and the surroundings. That's quite a lot of powerful Mages for only one city. After all, all the Mages I told you about are real mages, meaning ones that are equivalent to Commander Stage Warriors.\"\n\"There are more Apprentices and Adepts walking around, but I didn't count them just now.\"\nShang nodded.\nThis was the first time Shang had actually heard about all the different attributes Mages could have.\nFire, Earth, Wind, Water, Ice, Lightning, Metal.\nThese were the seven attributes.\nAt this moment, Shang looked at his left arm.\nDid he have an Ice Affinity?\nProbably not. After all, his left arm was acting very weirdly when unleashing Ice Mana.\nWater? No.\nFire? No.\nEarth? No.\nWind? No.\nLightning? No.\nMetal? No.\nNone of the affinities seemingly fit Shang.\nSo, what kind of affinity did he have?\nThe scout noticed that Shang became silent, but he didn't mind. He only wanted to get home and sleep. In comparison to a lot of other soldiers, the scout lived inside the barracks in Warrior's Paradise.\nThe two of them kept ascending the lonely road until they reached the entrance to Warrior's Paradise.",

Open up!\" the scout shouted.\nShang heard some shuffling coming from the other side of the gate, and a small slit opened.\n\"Oh, I thought you wouldn't come today,\" the guard behind the door, John, said.\n\"I've met a traveler, and I showed him around. Took a bit longer than expected,\" the scout said, gesturing towards Shang.\nThe eyes behind the slit moved to Shang.\n\"That late?\" he asked.\n\"Sorry,\" Shang said.\nShang heard a groan coming from behind the gate.\nCreak!\nA small door built into the gigantic gate opened, and a guard in bronze armor stepped outside.\nShang had seen several guards and soldiers from all the different cities and towns, and he had noticed that the lowest-ranked guards always had bronze-colored armor.\nHowever, just because the color was the same didn't mean that all the sets of armor were identical.\nThe normal guards in the Central Wild had worn normal bronze. It was useful for battle, but it wasn't the greatest. However, these guards also hadn't been very powerful. They had been even weaker than Shang.\nMeanwhile, the guards on Blizzard's Edge, who had also worn bronze armor, had been far more powerful. Even though their armor had been colored bronze, Shang had noticed that their armor felt way harder and more powerful.\nAnd now, Shang was confronted with a third kind of bronze armor.\nJohn's armor felt about equally as powerful as the silver armor the commander in Blizzard's Edge had worn.\nOn top of that, this guard gave Shang a feeling of mortal danger.\nThis normal guard was far more powerful than Shang.\nShang guessed that the guard was in the middle of the Second Realm, the General Stage. He was about as powerful as the dogs in the Farm Line.\n\"Fine!\" John grumbled as he stepped out. \"Put away your coat. Show your weapons, equipment, and valuables.\"\nThen, John looked at the scout as he remembered something. \"By the way, William, have you searched him?\"\n\"No,\" William answered directly.\nJohn frowned. \"Why not?\"\n\"Because it wouldn't have made a difference,\" William said. \"If I searched him and I told you that everything's fine, you would've still searched him. So, why should I?\"\n\"That's reckless!\" John said with annoyance. \"We need to check every unknown person. Otherwise, we'll put the city at risk!\"\nWilliam slowly looked at Shang.\nThen, he looked at John with a raised eyebrow.\nThey looked at each other for a while.\n\"Hmph,\" John grumbled as he averted his eyes. \"Fine, fine! You, put your stuff to the side!\"\nShang slowly put away his cloak and put it on a prepared counter beside the gate. Then, he took out his sword and placed it on top of the cloak.\nYet, before Shang pulled his hand away, he stopped.\nShang looked at his sword with open eyes.\nHe looked at his immaculate, black sword.\n'Isn't there supposed to be a crack in the sword?' Shang asked himself. 'I'm sure it got damaged in the battle against the Frozen Lake Stag!'\nShang was sure that his sword had been damaged.\nYet, he couldn't see any damage on his sword at this moment.\nIt was like new!\n\"Hey, hurry up!\" John shouted with impatience.\nShang got pulled out of his thoughts, and he also put his backpack on the counter. Lastly, he put the pouch of gold on the top.\nWilliam and John both looked over with surprise when they heard the telltale sound of gold.\nWilliam's eyebrows rose in surprise.\nWas all of that gold?\nJohn raised an eyebrow when he saw the sack of gold.\nThen, he looked at Shang. \"You got proof of ownership?\"\nShang pulled out the piece of paper that had been inside the sack of gold and handed it over.\nJohn looked at the piece of paper. \"Wait a second.\"\nThen, he entered the city again and closed the door.\n\"Don't worry,\" William said from the side. \"For such sums, we have to get an Adept to verify the integrity of the proof of ownership. When it comes to such sums of money, the proof of ownership is required to have a complex Magic Array on it. That makes it much harder to fake it.\"\nShang nodded.\n\"Anyway, how did you make so much money?\" William asked.\n\"I killed a Peak Soldier Stage Frozen Lake Stag in Coldew Village,\" Shang explained. \"The villagers gave me a sled wagon full of Ice Wood as repayment, and I sold it to the Mages in Blizzard's Edge.\"\nWilliam let out an impressed whistle. \"Seems like you've showed up at exactly the right moment.\"\nShang nodded. \"Well, it wouldn't have made much of a difference. The village simply would have had a worse harvest next season.\"\n\"Pulling such a heavy sled wagon for such a long distance was probably quite annoying,\" William said.\nShang nodded as his journey shot through his memories.\nHis hit-and-run on the bandits.\nHis encounter with that powerful spider.\nThe beggar bandits.\nIt sure wasn't easy.\nAfter around a minute, the door opened again, and John walked out.\nJohn handed over the piece of paper. \"Checks out,\" he commented.\nJohn gave the sack of gold back to Shang and looked at the coat with a grimace.\nShang knew why John was grimacing.\nFirst of all, no one liked Pest Cats, and second of all, that coat hadn't been washed in a very long time.\nThen, John opened the bag, and his grimace intensified.\nShang felt a bit bad since he hadn't had the opportunity to wash his spare clothes. Also, he was mostly using them as bedding.\nJohn rifled through the bag with a disgusted face and put it to the side after he was done.\nLastly, John looked at the sword. He held it up and lightly knocked on it with one of his knuckles.\nCLINGGGGG!\nThe sword vibrated for a while, and a confused expression appeared on John's face.\nThen, he knocked another time on the sword.\nThen, another time.\nIn the end, he scratched the back of his head in confusion and put the sword to the side.\n\"What's the sword made out of?\" he asked.\n\"I don't know,\" Shang said.\n\"You don't know?\" John asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\"I don't know,\" Shang repeated.\nJohn frowned a bit, but after releasing a sigh, he pushed everything back to Shang.\n\"You can enter,\" he said.\nJohn opened the door and walked through it.\nWilliam followed him, and Shang was the last one to walk through.\nBANG!\nThe door was closed behind Shang, and John entered another door without saying goodbye.\n\"We probably woke him,\" William said with a smile from the side.\n\"Woke him? Isn't he supposed to be working?\" Shang asked.\n\"What is he supposed to do?\" William asked with a shrug. \"He's responsible for checking the visitors, and there aren't many visitors that late at night. We have far more guards than jobs in Warrior's Paradise. That's why everyone only has to do a bit of work.\"\n\"Anyway,\" William said as he stretched a bit with a yawn. \"I should go to the barracks and sleep. You can find the Warrior's Academy at the west of Warrior's Paradise. It's surrounded by a huge, fancy fence. You can't miss it. They have a nightshift too, so you don't have to wait until tomorrow.\"\nShang nodded. \"Thank you a lot. You've explained a lot of things to me, and you've made everything easier.\"\nWilliam only waved his hand dismissively. \"I'm a social person, and I enjoy showing people around. Also, it's my job to help people as a member of the city guards. Goodnight.\"\n\"Goodnight,\" Shang said with a slight, polite bow.\nNow, Shang was alone again.\nShang took a deep breath as he looked at the city around him.\nThe buildings were tall, and there was little space between them. The roads were narrow, and many tiny alleys led to different parts of the city.\nWhen Shang saw these alleys, he got reminded of his home on Earth.\nThe alleys specifically reminded him of his last moments on Earth.\nWhat surprised Shang were the sounds in the city.\nThere were none.\nShang couldn't hear insects, animals, or anything living. He could only occasionally hear some guards walking around.\nThe streets were deserted.\nLuckily, the braziers on top of the towers illuminated the city enough so that Shang could see where he was going.\nShang looked at one of the alleys to his right. At the moment, Shang was facing south, and William told him that the academy was to the west.\n'Should I go through the alleys?' Shang thought as he scratched his chin.\nIn the end, Shang decided to continue to the south.\nHe had lived in enough cities in his previous life to know how cities were built. If this city followed the concept of Earth's cities, he should…\n'Knew it!'\nShang reached a big intersection in the middle of the city. There were big roads leading to all cardinal directions.\nShang looked at the intersection, and he realized that this was probably a huge bazaar or marketplace during the day.\nRight now, no one could be seen here, but Shang saw many smaller stalls and shops with large windows.\nShang followed the big road to the west. William said that the Warrior's Academy took up a huge portion of Warrior's Paradise. So, it shouldn't be difficult to find it.\nAfter walking for a bit, Shang saw a huge fence made of shiny, silver metal.\nIn the middle of the road was a fancy gate with plenty of decorations.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ When Shang saw the gate, his heart began to beat faster.\nThis was it!\nThis was the place where he would become more powerful!\nHe had lived for over half a year in the wilderness, and Shang hadn't learned from any human warrior in this world.\nThere had to be an incredible number of unimaginably powerful techniques in this world!\nThis was where Shang would join the true rank of the Warriors!\nThe Warrior's Academy!",

      "content": "Chapter 63 - The Sleeping Man\nShang looked at the grand gates for a while.\nThen, he took a deep breath and walked towards them.\nAs Shang came closer, he saw someone sitting right beside the gate. It was a middle-aged man, probably in his forties.\nWhat was he doing?\nSleeping.\nHe was sitting on a chair, and his entire body was just lazily splayed on the chair.\nWas this the nightshift William was talking about?\nShang looked at the sleeping person for a while with a complex expression.\nFor some reason, this person didn't feel dangerous to him.\nHowever, Shang was certain that he couldn't trust his perception in this case. After all, this person was guarding the gates alone.\nShang stopped a couple of meters away from the sleeping person with an awkward expression.\nShould he wake him?\nWell, he was supposed to be working.\n\"Excuse me,\" Shang said quietly.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The person didn't react.\n\"Excuse me,\" Shang said again as he stepped closer.\nThe person still didn't react.\nShang looked around at the dark city. He didn't want to wake the sleeping residents, so he couldn't just shout.\nShang scratched his chin. That guy was probably a powerful warrior, and if Shang just stepped forward, the guy might be startled awake. Who knew what the guy would do when startled? The reflexes of a warrior were dangerous.\nThen, Shang got an idea.\nHe stopped a couple of meters away.\nThen, he slightly moved his sword before moving it back into its original place.\nThe person didn't react.\n\"Are you awake now?\" Shang asked.\nShang saw the chest of the person expand as he took a deep breath. Then, he slowly sat up in his chair with a groan as he ruffled his hair.\n\"That was smart, boy,\" the man said with some annoyance.\n\"You were awake the entire time, right?\" Shang asked.\nThe man sighed. \"Yeah. Heard you since you walked closer. Simply didn't want to deal with you.\"\n\"Sorry, but it can't wait until tomorrow,\" Shang said.\nThe guard let out another annoyed sigh as he stood up. \"Thanks to you, I'm fully awake now. Thanks a lot,\" he said sarcastically.\n\"I had to get your attention some way,\" Shang answered.\nWhat was the man talking about?\nWell, a seasoned warrior had a terrifying perception and terrifying reflexes. Someone talking to them or someone walking around might not wake them, but the silent sound of a moving weapon definitely would get their attention.\nTheir mind would immediately go into full alert as soon as they heard that silent and deadly sound.\n\"What do you want?\" the man asked with annoyance.\n\"I want to join the academy,\" Shang said.\nThe man looked with annoyance at Shang. \"There's still quite a few months until the next trials start.\"\n\"I want a special exam,\" Shang said.\n\"Got the gold?\"\nShang took out his sack of gold and shook it a bit.\nThe man raised an eyebrow. \"Okay,\" he said with a bit more interest.\nSHING!\nSuddenly, the man appeared right in front of Shang. Shang's hairs rose in an instant, and he pulled out his sword to block the sword coming for his head.\nSWISH!\nShang's block missed as the sword pulled back before they could hit each other. At the same time, Shang jumped backward, fully alert.\n\"Are you crazy?!\" both of them silently shouted in whispering voices simultaneously.\nSilence.\n\"Do you have any idea how loud two clashing swords are?!\" the man shouted in a whispery voice. \"You would've woken the entire city.\"\n\"You were the one attacking me!\" Shang shouted back with a whispery voice. \"What was I supposed to do, just die?!\"\n\"I was obviously only testing you!\" the guy shouted back in a whispery voice. \"If I really wanted to kill you, you wouldn't even notice me!\"\n\"Don't you have a better way of testing me?!\" Shang asked with a very annoyed voice.\n\"That's payback for doing the same thing to me!\"\n\"I didn't attack you!\"\n\"So? You still triggered my battle instinct!\"\nShang took a deep breath to calm down.\n\"Alright, it's fine,\" Shang said. \"So, are you happy with my reaction?\"\nThe man had a slightly disappointed but also slightly interested expression on his face.\n\"Your reaction was extremely fast, and you immediately went for your weapon while evading. However, your way of moving your sword was weird, and it definitely needs work. It's like you've never seen a human swing a sword,\" the man said.\n\"I never had any form of training,\" Shang answered.\nThat surprised the man, and he looked at Shang with a very skeptical expression.\n\"That makes no sense,\" he said.\n\"But it's the truth,\" Shang answered.\n\"How?\"\n\"How what?\" Shang asked with annoyance. \"You go ask. I answer.\"\nThe man's brows furrowed. \"Alright. If you've never undergone training, how is your body already in the Peak Soldier Stage at your age?\"\n\"Absorb a lot of Mana, jump from trees,\" Shang answered.\nSilence.\nSeveral seconds of silence.\n\"What?\" the man asked.\n\"Yes, I've been in the wilderness. There was an Earth Fruit Hedgehog running around. I gave it food. It gave me its Earth Fruits. I eat one fruit, jump from a tree, nearly die, and regenerate.\"\nSilence.\n\"What?\" the man repeated.\n\"What what?! That's what happened!\" Shang shouted back in a whispery voice.\n\"Stop spouting bullshit,\" the man said with a frown.\n\"Dude, I'm not bullshitting you!\"\nThe man was taken aback suddenly.\n\"Dude?\" he asked. \"What's that? Is that an insult?\"\n\"It's just a phrase. It's something like bro, man, or similar stuff, but that doesn't matter now. I didn't lie!\" Shang answered.\nThe man released a silent hmph, deciding to postpone the topic for now.\n\"Fine, then what about your sword? How did you learn how to swing it?\" he asked.\n\"I just moved it around in ways to deal as much damage as possible. I pushed the power, speed, and precision as far as possible. Additionally, I tried to make them flow into each other without a gap. Essentially, I'm trying to get rid of all the awkward transitions between strikes,\" Shang explained.\nThe man raised an eyebrow. \"Alright, that would explain your weird movements. Show me your set.\"\n\"My what?\" Shang asked.\n\"Your set. You know, a choreographed showcase of your Martial Art,\" the man said.\nShang blinked a couple of times. \"I don't have that.\"\n\"What do you mean you don't have that?\" the man asked with frustration. \"Then, how are you training your swordsmanship?!\"\n\"I just do a couple of the same swings. Then, I do some other swings. Then, I combine swings from time to time. I do all that until I'm tired.\"\nAs the man listened to Shang, he began to rub the side of his head in disbelief.\nHe looked exactly like a person that went into a house and saw the house in an incredible mess.\nShang could practically read the mind of the man.\n'Where do I even begin to fix such a mess?'\nThese were probably his thoughts.\n\"Fine! Forget it,\" the man said after rubbing the bridge of his nose. \"We'll deal with this tomorrow. I can't let you in since you're not a student yet, so you have to wait until tomorrow.\"\n\"Fine,\" Shang said as his posture relaxed. Talking with this man had frustrated him quite a bit.\nThe man sat down on his chair again.\nThen, he saw Shang moving to the other side of the gate to sit down.\n\"What are you doing?\" the man asked.\n\"Waiting for tomorrow,\" Shang said.\n\"Here?\"\n\"Yes, why not?\"\n\"You do know that there are inns around here, right?\"\n\"It's late, and I don't want to wake them. Additionally, I'm used to sleeping outside.\"\nShang sat on the ground and leaned his back on the gatepost. Then, he took out his sword and put it beside him, nestling it in his arm.\nAt the same time, Shang put his coat over the front of his body.\nThe man scratched the side of his head awkwardly.\nThen, he sighed.\nPlonk!\nShang looked over, and he saw that a second chair had suddenly appeared out of thin air.\nShang looked in shock at the man. \"You have a Sparren?\" he asked.\n\"What?\" the man asked. \"No, I have a Space Ring.\"\n\"That's a Sparren,\" Shang answered.\nThe man looked with a weird expression at Shang. \"No, it's just a Space Ring.\"\n\"Yes, but the Sparren is the gem on the Space Ring.\"\n\"Okay, but then why didn't you just call it a Space Ring? Did you want to impress me with your vocabulary?\" the man asked with a snort.\n\"No, it was simply the first word that popped into my mind,\" Shang answered with annoyance.\n\"Who thinks of some sparring when looking at a Space Ring.\"\n\"Sparren.\"\n\"Sparren, whatever. Take the chair. I can't look at you sitting on the ground.\"\nShang looked at the chair with an awkward expression.\n\"No, thank you,\" he said.\n\"What?\" the man asked.\n\"I said, no, thank you,\" Shang repeated.\n\"Why no?\" the man asked.\n\"Because It's more comfortable on the floor.\"\n\"How is it more comfortable? Chairs are literally designed for humans to sit in,\" the man answered with annoyance.\n\"Well, I don't want it. I like the ground,\" Shang said back.\n\"Take it,\" the man said as he kicked the chair over.\n\"I don't want it,\" Shang said as he pushed the chair back again.\n\"Take it! I don't want to see you sitting on the ground,\" the man said with frustration, pushing the chair back to Shang.\n\"I don't want it!\" Shang said as he pushed it back.\n\"I don't care if you don't want it! I don't want to see someone sitting on the ground beside me. It's embarrassing! You look like a beggar!\"\n\"So? I don't care,\" Shang answered.\nThe man groaned. \"Just do it for me, okay?\"\n\"No, why would I? You attacked me earlier,\" Shang said with a sneer.\n\"That again!?\" the man shouted in a whispery voice as he stood up.\n\"Yes, that again. I haven't heard you apologize.\"\n\"Why should I apologize? You woke me by pulling out your sword!\"\n\"Yeah, because you were sleeping on the job!\"\n…\nThis wouldn't be a quiet night.",

      "content": "Chapter 64 - Different World\n\"Wake up,\" the man said with an annoyed voice. \"It's time for our deal.\"\nShang slowly opened his eyes with annoyance.\nThe two of them had argued for way too long.\nIn the end, they had come to a deal.\nShang could sit on the ground for the night, but when people would begin to show up, he would sit on the chair.\nShang stood up, pulled the chair over, and sat down.\n\"Was that so hard?\" the man asked.\n\"I can also just sit on the ground again,\" Shang answered with an even voice.\n\"Hmph,\" the man only snorted.\nIn the next couple of minutes, Shang saw the sky slowly light up.\nThe braziers had been put out a couple of minutes ago, and Shang heard the first faint noises of movement from the surrounding houses.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ It seemed like the 500 or so people directly living in the city had their houses adjacent to the academy.\nA couple minutes later, Shang saw the first people exit their houses. They walked with practiced ease to their destinations.\n\"Bakers and smiths,\" the man said. \"They have to wake up very early.\"\n\"Mhm,\" Shang muttered.\nSome minutes later, the sky became bright enough that even a normal person could see in the streets. Due to the high elevation and the walls, the dawn couldn't be seen from within the city.\nSome more minutes later, more people began to exit their houses as they all walked in the direction of the city center. Those were probably all the merchants and other artisans.\nWHOOOOM!\nSuddenly, a loud horn echoed throughout the city, and Shang looked up.\n\"That's the signal that the gates are being opened,\" the man explained as he stood up. Then, he walked over to the gate and simply pushed it open.\n\"It wasn't locked?\" Shang asked.\n\"Why would we lock it? I'm here, after all,\" he said.\nThe man stretched a bit as he fixed his clothing. He had to appear presentable to the students.\nSome minutes later, Shang heard the sound of a horde of people moving, and a couple of seconds later, Shang saw several youngsters and children walk towards the academy.\nSome of them were ten-year-old kids.\nSome were already adults.\nSome wore bronze uniforms.\nSome wore yellow uniforms.\nSome walked in groups.\nSome walked alone.\nHowever, one thing was the same for every student.\nThey all wore at least one weapon on their person.\nShang received plenty of different gazes from the passing students. Some of them looked with confusion at him, some with interest, and some with disgust.\n\"Hello, teacher!\"\n\"Good morning, teacher!\"\n\"Finally done with work, huh?\"\nMany students greeted the middle-aged man beside the gate.\nThe children were very polite, while the older ones were more casual.\nThe teacher gave some polite and curt replies while the students passed him.\n\"Quite popular, huh?\" Shang commented.\n\"Tch, they only respect my status,\" the man answered quietly, \"but at least they respect something.\"\n\"Do you want to start with that topic again?\" Shang asked.\n\"Hmph,\" the man harrumphed without saying anything more to Shang.\nShang kept looking at the passing students.\nThey just didn't end!\nIn fact, the entire street was crowded with people. It was almost like a festival was taking place in the city.\nBy now, the city had also become very noisy and loud. The number of guards on the walls had also multiplied by several times.\nSuddenly, Shang saw a shadow.\nThe shadow of a person had just jumped from the wall, right into the academy.\n\"That's the dean,\" the teacher said when he noticed Shang's gaze. \"He oversees the security of the city by night and leads the academy during the day.\"\nShang's eyes widened in surprise. \"Doesn't he need to sleep?\"\nThe teacher only snorted. \"People on his level don't need to sleep any longer. Don't forget, the dean is the most powerful warrior in the entire world.\"\nThat's when Shang remembered everything he had been told of the Warrior Academy.\nRight! The strongest warrior in the world stayed here!\nThe only warrior that had ever managed to reach the Fourth Realm, the same Realm as Duke Whirlwind!\nShang felt a feeling of wonder when he realized that he had just caught a glimpse of the most powerful warrior in the entire world.\nIt had only been a glimpse, but that glimpse had meant taking a glimpse at the current peak of physical fighting.\nAfter a couple of minutes, the flood of students slowly subsided. Yet, what replaced the students were the teachers.\nShang saw several people in silver uniforms walking down the street, talking with each other.\nThey didn't wear armor, but their uniforms were obviously designed to also be used in battle. They seemed light but powerful, hard but flexible.\nSome of the teachers were also talking with some older students. Obviously, the barrier between teacher and students wasn't as stringent when the student reached a certain age.\nAfter all, they were all adults at that point.\nBOOOM!\nSuddenly, a loud explosion came from the top of the city walls.\nShang looked over in shock, and he saw a gigantic ballista on top of a wall.\nHe saw several soldiers standing around it, all looking over the wall, into the distance. Two of them wore silver armor, while the others wore bronze armor.\nThe sound had obviously come from this ballista firing.\nA second later, the guards high-fived each other.\n\"Sometimes, Spear Storks fly too close to the city,\" the teacher explained. \"They are Beasts in the Third Realm, the Commander Stage. We can't always send soldiers to hunt them down, so we kill as many as we can from the city.\"\nThird Realm.\nShang was reminded of the Earth Fruit Hedgehog and the Old Ice Octopus in Duke Whirlwind's garden.\nSuch a majestic beast had died… just like that?\nAt this moment, Shang finally realized what kind of place he had come to.\nThe most powerful warrior in the world was here.\nOver a hundred real Mages were here.\nWho knew how many Commander Stage Warriors were here.\nBeasts on the level of the Earth Fruit Hedgehog were regularly killed by some random guards.\nThe difference was just too vast.\nIn Duke Whirlwind's garden, the Earth Fruit Hedgehog might as well have counted as a God.\nOn the outside, Beasts on General Stage had reigned supreme, and Shang had nearly died to one of them.\nThe most powerful guards had been in the General Stage.\nBut here…\nHere, Commander Stage Beasts died on the daily.\nCommander Stage Beasts were nothing special in this place.\nShang couldn't even fight a General Stage Beast, but he had entered a place where not even Commander Stage Beasts were special.\nFor the first time, Shang felt like he was far out of his depth.\nOn the outside, he had been a force to be reckoned with. Not even the real bandits had dared to attack him after they had known of his location.\nEvery beast except for the most powerful ones had been under Shang's mercy.\nBut here, Shang was only a common youngster.\nEvery single guard in the city could easily kill him.\nThere were even several students in the General Stage.\nShang was in a different world.\n\"Oh? Who's that?\" one of the teachers asked the teacher beside Shang.\n\"He came at night,\" the teacher answered. \"He wants to have the special exam.\"\n\"Oh?\" the other teacher answered as he looked at Shang.\nShang was taken out of his thoughts, and he looked at the new teacher.\n\"I have time right now,\" the other teacher said.\n\"Follow me. I'll take care of your exam.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 65 - Amnesia\nShang looked at the new teacher.\nThe new teacher looked like someone in his early thirties. He had long, emerald green hair, and he wore a green suit of leather armor.\nThis teacher's appearance surprised Shang. First of all, that teacher didn't wear the normal silver getup that all the other teachers wore. Second of all, he appeared a bit on the younger side for teachers. Most of the teachers looked like they were in their forties or fifties.\n\"Follow him, boy,\" the first teacher said to Shang with an annoyed tone.\n\"Oh, right!\" Shang answered. Then, he looked at the new teacher and nodded politely. \"Thank you.\"\n\"No thanks necessary,\" the green-haired teacher said with a smile. \"After all, you're paying for all of this.\"\nShang only nodded.\nThe teacher looked at the others. \"Talk to you later,\" he said.\n\"Don't abuse him too hard,\" a woman from the side giggled.\n\"Why do you always have to do this, Melena?\" the teacher asked with a groan. \"If you keep doing this, the students will one day start believing your crap.\"\nThe other teachers only giggled as they entered the academy.\nThe teacher watched them leave and sighed. \"You can choose your friends, but you can't choose your colleagues,\" the teacher said to Shang.\n\"You can,\" came a distant shout from one of the teachers.\n\"Stuff it!\" the teacher shouted back with furrowed brows.\nShang could only hear more laughing.\n\"Come,\" the teacher said as he gestured to the school with his head before entering.\nShang followed behind the teacher and looked around. For the first time, Shang could actually see the inside of this legendary academy.\nShang could see empty fields filled with rubble, some clean training places, and even a small forest, which surprised him. Warrior's Paradise was already very limited in terms of space, and the academy just placed a forest here?\n\"Hide and seek,\" the teacher in front of Shang said.\n\"What?\" Shang asked.\n\"Hide and seek,\" the teacher repeated as he gestured towards the forest. \"You won't always fight in open terrain. Sometimes, you are outmatched, and you have to flee. Sometimes, opponents might hide in the area to ambush you. That's what the forest is for.\"\n\"Oh, okay. Makes sense,\" Shang said absentmindedly.\nThe teacher noticed that Shang was too preoccupied with looking, so he didn't elaborate further.\n\"The atmosphere between you teachers feels more personal and comfortable than I anticipated,\" Shang commented suddenly.\nThe teacher snorted. \"Why wouldn't it be? We're colleagues.\"\n\"Yes, that's normal, but it's not a given that the relationship between your boss and you is that relaxed.\"\n\"Oh?\" the teacher uttered as he threw a glance toward Shang. \"What gave you that idea?\"\n\"You're not adhering to the obvious dress code,\" Shang answered. \"Additionally, one of the others shouted that you can choose your colleagues, hinting at personnel responsibility.\"\n\"Personnel responsibility?\" the teacher repeated with confusion while scratching his chin. \"That's an interesting word. I've never heard of it before, but I can take a good guess at its meaning.\"\n\"Anyway, quite impressive of you to see these details. It might seem obvious to you, but not everyone notices these things. A lot of people look at what I wear, and they think that I'm just some janitor or something. After all, my uniform isn't as lavish as the other teachers' uniforms,\" the teacher said with a chuckle.\n\"Where did you learn of these things? From which family are you?\" the teacher asked.\nShang felt a bit awkward after receiving that question.\n\"I'm not from any family,\" Shang said.\nThe teacher looked at Shang with a skeptical expression. \"So, you learned that all on your own?\"\n\"That's the difficult part,\" Shang said. \"I don't know.\"\n\"You don't know?\"\n\"Yes, I don't know,\" Shang confirmed. \"My oldest memory is from when I woke up in Duke Whirlwind's garden a bit more than half a year ago.\"\nAfter hearing that, the teacher stopped walking as he looked at Shang with a strict expression. \"With your bright mind, you can probably understand why that story sounds so unbelievable. There is also plenty of reason to keep one's affiliation with certain families and organizations a secret.\"\n\"However, you have to know that this academy is run by the strongest warrior in the world, and he's a very altruistic person. He isn't interested in politics, and he only wants to further the advance of humans in terms of physical power.\"\n\"All your past political affiliations are irrelevant here. Yes, we might be in Duke Whirlwind's territory, and yes, we might have a deep connection with him, but the dean has made it very clear that we accept everyone.\"\n\"So, with all of that said, are you still adamant about the fact that you lost your memory? I must warn you. We have ways to check if your claim is true,\" the teacher explained.\n\"Yes, because that's what happened,\" Shang said calmly.\nThe man looked at Shang with a skeptical expression. \"Alright, then let's test that right now. Please don't resist.\"\nShang only stood there without moving.\nThe teacher pointed his finger at Shang's forehead and then…\nHe started to cast a spell.\nShang was surprised when he saw that the teacher was casting a spell.\nWasn't this supposed to be a warrior's academy?\nDidn't the guy wear leather armor and a long spear on his back?\nWhy did that guy suddenly start casting a spell!?\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The teacher took several seconds to finish his spell. Obviously, he was unused to casting spells or, at least, to casting this specific spell.\nAdditionally, Shang felt the words the teacher said to be familiar.\nHadn't he heard similar words before?\nWhen the teacher was finished, some Mana came out of his finger and entered Shang's mind.\nNow, Shang remembered where he had heard that before.\nDuke Whirlwind had cast the same spell to check if everything was alright with Shang's mind.\nHowever, the Duke hadn't even needed a full second to cast that spell.\nAfter traveling through Shang's head, the Mana came out from the back of his head.\nThe teacher looked at the Mana, and his face showed surprise.\n\"So?\" Shang asked.\n\"Well, it seems like you've spoken the truth,\" the teacher said with a surprised expression. \"I can see that something in your mind doesn't make sense.\"\n\"Can you tell me more about it?\" Shang asked, fully knowing what the answer was going to be.\nThe teacher sighed. \"Sorry, but I'm only training in Magic to supplement my fighting style. I'm a Magic Warrior, if you've heard the term before. I know some spells not related to combat, but using them is very difficult and draining for me.\"\n\"The only thing I can test is to see if the Mana coming out of your mind is normal-looking or not. We mainly use that spell to check if someone's memory has been tampered with. That's basically the only thing we can do with it.\"\n\"Alright,\" Shang said with a nod.\nThe teacher scratched his chin in surprise.\nHe had been certain that this kid had lied to him, but, apparently, the kid hadn't.\nAmnesia, huh?\nWho would've thought?\nThen, the teacher wanted to continue leading Shang to the academy, but he stopped when he noticed how weird Shang's reaction had been.\nHow would an amnesiac person act when someone had just cast a spell on them that demonstrated their amnesia?\nWouldn't they immediately ask for ways to cure it? Wouldn't they be anxious or hopeful?\nYet, Shang acted like it was only normal.\n\"Someone has done that to you before, right?\" the teacher asked.\nShang nodded.\n\"And you perceive that person to be even better at casting magic than me, right?\" he asked.\nShang nodded again.\n\"You don't even know how good I am at casting spells, and you assume that I'm automatically less skilled than that person?\" the teacher asked with a frown. \"Any half-skilled Adept can cast that spell. What made you so sure that I'm less skilled?\"\nShang only looked at the teacher.\n\"I haven't seen you fly through the air.\"\nThis shocked the teacher.\nFlying?\nThere were only less than ten people in the world that could fly, and this guy was telling him that he talked to one of them?\nHowever, the teacher quickly remembered what Shang had told him.\nShang's earliest memory was of him waking up in Duke Whirlwind's garden.\nSo, wasn't it logical…\n\"Did you meet Duke Whirlwind in his garden?\" the teacher asked.\nShang nodded.\nThe teacher took a deep breath and released a sigh.\n\"Alright, if he can't see what's happened to your mind, I don't even need to attempt. Let's continue. We don't have all day.\"\nWith that said, the teacher continued.\nShang only looked at the teacher.\nShang was pretty sure that the teacher was regretting his earlier words about Shang not being able to tell whether someone was more powerful or not.\nAfter some seconds of increasing the teacher's discomfort by only looking at him, Shang followed the teacher.\nIn the front, the teacher only rubbed his face.\nWhen cheeks flushed with blood, they often itched.",

      "content": "Chapter 66 - Pen\nAfter a while of walking, the two of them entered the academy.\nThe building itself looked like a typical school, just more… royal?\nThere were plenty of designs and edges that reminded Shang of the Baroque period on Earth. The building simply looked very old but very expensive.\nHowever, the feeling that the building was old came from Shang's perception when he had been on Earth. After all, all of the buildings that looked like that were old. Yet, the building Shang was currently in looked to be rather new, and it was in top condition.\nThe halls were grand, and Shang could see many weapons hanging from the walls. Shang's sword was shaking on his back due to all the powerful ore around him. Luckily, Shang's cloak hid his sword's shaking.\nShang followed the teacher up some stairs, and after going down a long corridor, the two entered a hall.\nThe hall wasn't very big, but it also wasn't small. It was around ten by ten meters. A large table with a couple of chairs surrounding it was at the edge of the hall, making the layout of the hall a bit awkward. Having the table in the middle felt more natural.\n\"Take a seat. I'll call the two other people,\" the teacher explained as he took out a small crystal from his Space Ring. \"We need three people for an official exam.\"\nThe teacher spoke a couple of words into his crystal and put it away again. After that, the teacher walked over to a drawer on the side and took out some papers.\nThe teacher put the papers in front of Shang. \"You know how to read and write?\" he asked.\nFor a second, Shang thought that this question was ridiculous, but he remembered that he was in a different world now. Being able to read and write probably wasn't common.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"I can,\" Shang said as he looked at the papers in front of him.\nForms.\n'I thought I got rid of all that bureaucracy when I left Earth,' Shang thought with annoyance.\nShang quickly took the pen-\n'A pen?' Shang suddenly thought as he looked at the pen in his hand. 'Shouldn't I get a quill and inkwell?'\nShang looked with surprise at the pen. The pen looked like a crudely made ballpoint pen, which weirded Shang out.\nA ballpoint pen?\nIn this world?\n\"You don't need an inkwell to write,\" the teacher said, pointing at the pen. \"That's what we call a pen. It has an integrated inkwell. You only need to press down to write.\"\nShang looked at the teacher for a bit and then back at the paper with furrowed brows.\nBut in the end, Shang simply accepted the reality that is a pen in a world filled with Mages and warriors.\nShang filled out all the questions on the form. The questions were very basic. Shang was asked about his name, family, knowledge, combat style, combat experience, and many other relevant things to his chosen profession.\nWhile filling out the forms, two other teachers entered the hall. They greeted the first teacher and sat down beside him.\nOne of them was a young woman with fiery red hair, while the other one was an old man with grey hair. The woman was probably in her twenties, while the old man was probably in his seventies.\n\"Viera, what are you doing here?\" the first teacher asked the young woman while Shang was still filling out forms.\n\"I'm hunting later in the day today,\" Viera said with a smile. \"I want to enter the Canyon on the evening.\"\nThe first teacher furrowed his brows. \"Are you certain? You haven't been in the Commander Stage for a long time. Going to the Canyon now might be a bit too soon.\"\n\"I know,\" Viera said, \"but I need to feel some danger again. Hunting Commander Stage beasts at the edges of the Wasteland isn't exciting anymore. I feel like I'm going to lose my battle instincts if I wait longer.\"\nThe first teacher still looked with uncertainty at Viera. \"Do you want me to accompany you as insurance?\"\n\"Soran, if you accompany me, there won't be any danger at all,\" Viera said with a slight chuckle. \"That would defeat the entire purpose.\"\nSoran, the first teacher, only looked with a worried expression at Viera. \"Well, if you're certain that you're doing the right thing, go ahead. Just tell me when you plan on being back. I don't want to worry for the entire night.\"\nViera only chuckled a bit. \"Aww, you're cute, Soran. Sometimes, I think you're my teacher, not my senior.\"\nWhile filling out his forms, Shang threw a covert glance at Soran and Viera.\n'Close physical contact initiated by her, higher voice, many chuckles, constant eye contact, compliments.'\n'She's either someone who enjoys toying with men, or she has the hots for him.'\nSuddenly, Viera shot a stern glance at Shang. \"What are you looking at?\" she asked with a dark voice.\nShang looked Viera in the eyes.\n\"You distracted me. Of course I'm going to look at the source of distraction,\" Shang said evenly before going back to filling out his form as if nothing had happened.\nViera was taken aback by Shang's words and tone.\nShe had expected Shang to cower back at her admonishment and apologize, but Shang had only answered in a very direct manner.\n\"Seems like he's not buying your bullshit.\"\nViera looked at the third teacher, the old man, with an angry gaze. \"Do you have to word it so crude?\" she asked with annoyance.\nThe old man only laughed. \"You acted all flirtatious in front of him. Of course he's not going to jump back after your outburst. He has seen your sweet side now, which makes your angry side not as ugly.\"\nViera's face became red at being called out. \"Mervin! Stop saying random stuff! If there are rumors being spread on the school property tomorrow, it's your fault!\"\nMervin only snorted. \"The rumors have been going around for months at this point. The only reason why you haven't noticed is that you basically live in the Wasteland.\"\n\"Rumors? What rumors?\" Viera asked in shock.\nMervin only smirked. \"What else? It's that-\"\n\"I'm done,\" Shang suddenly said as he pushed the forms to the other side of the desk, to the three teachers.\n\"Shut up! Don't interrupt him!\" Viera said with an annoyed voice as she threw Shang a venomous glance. Then, she looked back at Mervin with a nervous expression. \"What kind of rumo-\"\n\"Looks good,\" Soran suddenly said, interrupting Viera. \"Some of the things on the forms make seemingly no sense, but I've seen stuff like that plenty of times. We just have to see how you fight, and we'll get everything figured out.\"\nViera looked with annoyance at Soran, but she only bit her lower lip as she suppressed her rebuttal.\nShang shot a knowing look towards Soran.\nShang knew that the stuff he had written down was probably far from ordinary. After all, when it asked about Shang's combat style, Shang had simply said sword. When it had asked about the techniques Shang had learned, Shang had simply crossed out the page.\nYet, when it asked about Shang's combat experience, Shang had run out of space on the paper.\nEvery single person would make a doubletake at that form and ask Shang several questions for clarification.\nHowever, Soran had simply waved the form off like everything was alright, and Shang knew why.\nSoran didn't want to confront Viera's romantic feelings.\nHe obviously knew about them, judging by his actions, but he avoided directly acknowledging them.\nClap! Clap!\nSoran clapped twice into his hands to get the attention of the other two teachers. \"Alright, the official exam starts now. Please keep the topics not related to the examination out of the examination.\"\nMervin only laughed while Viera frowned with annoyance.\nMeanwhile, Soran looked at Shang with a devious smirk.\n\"Well then, let's begin, shall we?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 67 - Sword, Yes?\nShang nodded. He had waited for this examination for way too long.\nSoran answered with a nod of his own and turned towards Mervin. \"Mervin, you're the sword instructor. Could you get us a fitting opponent for Shang? You know how examinations work.\"\nMervin nodded and wanted to stand up but stopped. \"Shang? That's his name?\" he asked.\n\"That's at least what he wrote onto the form,\" Soran said as he waved one of the forms around.\nMervin shot a weird glance at Shang.\n\"Weird name, kid,\" he said before leaving.\nViera only snorted, showing that she didn't like what Mervin had just said.\nSoran only awkwardly looked at Shang. \"You have to excuse Mervin. He's an old but very capable teacher. As you might have noticed, he always speaks his mind.\"\n\"No, he's right,\" Shang said. \"Shang is a weird name.\"\nSoran's face transformed into a representation of confusion.\nThat was not the answer he had expected.\n\"Well, alright then. As long as you don't take what Mervin said personally,\" Soran said.\n\"How is it not personal?\" Shang asked. \"He literally commented on my name. It doesn't really get any more personal.\"\nSoran moved his hands forward like he wanted to stop an expensive vase from falling to the ground. \"That's not what I meant.\"\n\"I know what you meant,\" Shang said.\nSoran pulled back again as he looked at Shang with a slightly frustrated expression. \"Then why didn't you say so?\" he asked with forced politeness.\n\"Why didn't you word it correctly?\" Shang answered.\n\"You,\" Soran said as his hands very lightly indicated that he wanted to strangle Shang. Then, he took a deep breath to calm down. \"Fine. It's fine. The situation's resolved,\" he said.\nShang didn't answer anymore.\nOn the side, Viera shot a strange look at Shang.\nThis kid wasn't like most other kids.\nWas something wrong with him?\nAfter some time passed, Mervin returned with a young man.\nShang looked at the young man, or more precisely, boy.\nHe couldn't be older than 16.\nWhen Shang saw the boy, he felt a slight feeling of threat.\nBy now, Shang was very good at judging his opponent. The slight feeling of threat he felt meant that the other side was capable of injuring him, but that was it.\nHe wasn't a real threat.\nAfter all, even a Pest Cat had the capabilities to injure Shang.\nThe young man looked at Shang with burning eyes.\nTwo teachers and the Vice-Dean were here!\nHe had to prove his worth in front of them!\n\"This will be an exhibition match,\" Soran explained. \"You two will fight each other. Shang, this match won't decide if you can join our academy or not. It's simply there so we can get a better look at your fighting style.\"\n\"Please, you can fight over there,\" Soran said as he gestured to the empty half of the hall.\n'So that's why the table's at the side,' Shang thought.\nShang walked over to one end of the hall as he looked at his opponent.\nShang's opponent took out his sword. It was a one-handed sword focused on a mixture of speed and power. It wasn't as thin as a rapier, but it also wasn't very broad.\nClk!\nThe silent sound of something metallic moving could be heard from Shang, but none of the present people could see what Shang was doing. His sword had been hidden beneath his cloak the entire time.\nThe teachers nodded when they saw that. Keeping one's weapon hidden made it harder for the opponent to prepare themselves.\n\"You can start whenever you want. This fight is not-\"\nBANG!\nThe sound of Shang jumping forward with a lot of power reverberated throughout the hall, interrupting Soran's words.\nShang's opponent hadn't been ready for Shang to suddenly attack, and he quickly lifted his sword to block.\nHowever, he didn't know from which direction Shang would strike.\nShang's sword was still hidden behind his cloak.\nAs Shang approached, his opponent quickly changed his block to a chop. In the academy, he had learned that the only option was to attack when one couldn't find a proper defense.\nShang saw the sword swing towards him, but he had already known that would happen.\nShang wasn't arrogant. He knew exactly that his opponent knew more about how to wield a sword than him. So, entering a sword battle with him would be stupid.\nShang saw the sword swing down. Shang put all his power into his sword arm and directly targeted the opponent's sword.\nBANG!\nThe two swords hit each other, creating sparks as they bounced away.\nSHING!\nHowever, Shang's sword immediately shot into the ground. Shang had blocked a chop coming from above, but instead of pulling his sword back into a combat-stance, Shang let go of his sword!\nThe opponent put all of his power into recovering his sword, leaving him open.\nMeanwhile, Shang wasn't blown back since he had let go of the source of pushback.\nPulling off such a maneuver took a lot of practice, but Shang had had enough practice.\nAt the moment, Shang's opponent was out of balance as he tried to pull his sword back.\nBANG!\nShang's shoulder rammed into his opponent's torso, taking the air out of his lungs.\nShang pushed his opponent over and fell on top of him. Then, Shang moved around his opponent's body with practiced ease.\nCRK!\n\"AAAHHH!\"\nThe young man shouted in pain as Shang violently kicked the sword away, breaking at least one finger in the process.\nThen, Shang used the opening to get behind the opponent.\nLastly, Shang put his arms around his opponent's neck and head in a sleeper hold, simultaneously pulling him away from his sword.\nThe young man's mouth opened in pain and terror as he tried to resist.\nYet, as more time passed, he began to see stars until he only saw black.\nWhen Shang saw that his opponent had gone limp, he let go, making sure that the man wouldn't hit his head on the ground.\nThen, Shang stood up and cracked his neck.\nAfter that, Shang looked at the teachers.\nThe teachers only looked with open mouths at Shang.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Soran looked through the forms again to make sure that he hadn't misread.\nCombat Style? Sword.\nNo, it definitely said sword there.\nSome seconds later, the young man on the ground groaned as he slowly regained consciousness. Right now, the young man's mind was filled with nothing but confusion.\nWhat had happened?\nWhy was he here?\nAnd then, he looked with shock at his right hand and the two broken fingers on it.\nSuddenly, everything came back to him, and he looked at Shang, who stood in the middle of the hall right now.\n\"I was told this would be a sword fight!\" the young man shouted with a voice filled with a mixture of panic, pain, and anger.\nShang threw the young man a short glance.\n'Interesting. He's more concerned with how I fought than his broken fingers. I guess injuries are pretty normal in the academy.'\nMeanwhile, the teachers only looked at each other with uncertainty.\nThis wasn't what they had expected.\nSoran looked at the forms again and then at Shang.\n\"Sword, yes?\" he asked.\nShang nodded.",

Don't you know that throwing your weapon away is basically suicide in a battle?\" Soran asked with furrowed brows.\n\"How is it suicide when I won?\" Shang asked.\n\"There could have been other opponents around, and after you took down your current opponent, you might not have the time to retrieve your sword,\" Soran said.\n\"But there aren't any other opponents,\" Shang said matter-of-factly. \"The only other people in this room are you three, and if you three decide to attack me, having my sword wouldn't make a difference.\"\n\"Yes, but what if-\"\n\"But there isn't,\" Shang answered.\n\"You don't know what I would have said!\" Soran answered with a seething tone.\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Shang said. \"You started your sentence with what if, which means that it isn't something that has happened.\"\nSoran sucked in a violent breath of air through his nose. \"Alright, fine! So, why didn't you use your sword till the very end?\" he said with suppressed rage.\n\"Because that's stupid,\" Shang answered.\nThis was not the answer Soran had expected, and he looked at Shang with a confused expression.\n\"Why?\" was all he asked.\n\"Because he's had tutoring on how to fight with a sword while I hadn't,\" Shang said, pointing at the young man, who had stood up by now. \"He's obviously better at using a sword than me. I was in a disadvantageous position, so I moved the fight into a favorable position for me.\"\nMervin broke out into laughter as Soran lifted his hands. He angrily formed them into fists before opening them again. It was like he imagined how it felt to strangle Shang.\nThen, Soran relaxed as he let out a long sigh.\n\"That was the point,\" he said.\nShang lifted an eyebrow in a skeptical expression.\n\"That was the entire point,\" Soran repeated. \"This exhibition match was supposed to show you what proper teachings can accomplish. This match was supposed to teach you something.\"\n\"Why didn't you say so earlier?\" Shang asked with an annoyed expression. \"I wouldn't have done that if I had known the goal of the exhibition match.\"\nSoran's eyelid twitched again. \"I was going to, but you attacked before I could tell you.\"\n\"But you said that we can begin whenever we want,\" Shang answered.\n\"Yes!\" Soran shouted back, \"but it's normal to wait until the introductions and the explanation regarding the fight were finished!\"\n\"Then why didn't you say that we could begin whenever we want at the end of your explanation?\" Shang asked.\n\"You fu-\"Soran said before catching himself.\nMervin only broke out into more laughter.\nSoran completely ignored Mervin at this point.\nSoran took another deep breath to calm down.\n\"Shang, listen,\" he said calmly. \"We are trying to help you. We are trying to teach you something. We are not your enemies, and you don't have to be so uncooperative. We are all on the same side.\"\n\"Uncooperative?\" Shang repeated with furrowed brows. \"You told me what I should do, and I've done what you said. What is uncooperative about that?\"\n\"It is common courtesy to wait until everything's clear,\" Soran said with slightly narrowed eyes.\n\"And how am I supposed to know that?\" Shang asked.\nSoran's expression transformed into a very skeptical one. \"Because it's COMMON courtesy. People COMMONLY know about it,\" he said.\n\"Okay, cool, and how long have I been amongst humans?\" Shang asked.\nSoran's eyes widened as realization struck.\nThe other two teachers looked at Soran with confusion. In their mind, Soran was supposed to shout back.\nSoran took another deep breath and slowly put his right hand to his forehead. \"I'm sorry. I forgot about that.\"\nThis surprised Mervin and Viera.\nWhere did that change suddenly come from?\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"It's fine,\" Shang answered. \"So, what now?\"\nThe other two teachers still looked with confusion at Soran while Soran slowly stood up.\nThen, Soran walked around the table while looking at the other young man. \"Please go to the Water Mage,\" he said. \"After that, you can return to class.\"\nFor a second, Shang was confused about why Soran had sent the young man to a Water Mage, but after seeing the young man's broken fingers, Shang made a connection in his mind.\n'Do Water Mages have healing capabilities?' Shang thought.\n\"I didn't lose!\" the young man shouted with panic and nervousness. It was almost like his dream was breaking apart in front of him. \"He cheated!\"\nThe entire atmosphere in the room changed as the three teachers shot admonishing looks at the young man.\n\"What's his name?\" Soran asked without looking back.\n\"Michael from the Brestow family,\" Mervin answered.\n\"Michael,\" Soran said slowly. \"In battle, we can't be sure about the powers of our enemies. Some Mages dye their hair and clothing just to look like a Mage with a different affinity. Sometimes, some warriors walk around with a gigantic halberd on their backs when their real weapon is a hidden dagger in their sleeve.\"\n\"When you enter a battle, you have to keep in mind what your opponent can use to hurt you. Yes, to some extent, we were also at fault since we fed you incorrect information about your opponent, but in the end, you are still responsible for your own battles.\"\n\"You both have about equally powerful bodies, and you had a chance to win. Taking your opponent by surprise is one of the most important factors in winning.\"\n\"I'll chalk up your current outburst to your broken fingers and your loss of consciousness earlier. I'll forgive it this time, but I don't want to hear something like that again.\"\n\"Do I make myself clear, Michael?\" Soran said with a strict voice.\nBy now, Michael didn't look angry anymore.\nIn fact, Michael looked very afraid, ashamed, and nervous.\nHe knew that he had screwed up big time.\n\"I'm sorry, Vice-Dean. In my fear of appearing too weak, I appeared too weak. I have lost, and that's that. I will remember your teachings, Vice-Dean,\" Michael said with a voice filled with shame.\nSoran nodded, and a smile returned to his face. \"Then everything's fine. Please, go to the Water Mage and return to class. We're sorry for the inconvenience.\"\n\"Yes, thank you, Vice-Dean,\" Michael said with a polite bow. Then, he turned to Mervin. \"Thank you, teacher.\"\nThen, surprisingly, Michael turned to Shang. \"I'm sorry for my earlier words,\" he said.\nShang was a bit surprised.\nIn Shang's mind, this boy was just that, a boy. He hadn't expected a teenager to genuinely admit to their mistake that easily.\nMichael could have left without talking to Shang, and everything would have been alright.\n\"It's fine,\" Shang said. \"And sorry for the broken fingers. I got lost in the fight.\"\n\"It's okay,\" Michael said. \"I'm used to injuries. So, see you in class, Shang.\"\nShang nodded.\nThen, Michael left the hall.\nMeanwhile, Soran had arrived at the place where the young man had just been.\nSHING!\nSoran took out his spear and held it in his right hand.\nAs soon as Soran took out his spear, it was like Shang was assaulted with an apocalyptic pressure.\nIt was like a gigantic dragon had just looked into Shang's eyes.\n\"I will reduce my power to the Mid Soldier Stage, two levels below you,\" Soran said.\nSHING!\nSoran pointed his spear at Shang.\n\"How about I show you what you can do with proper training?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 69 - Battle With Soran\nBreathing became difficult for Shang. Even though the person in front of him wasn't showing any killing intent, Shang could still feel the sheer power behind him.\nHowever, it wasn't only his power. There was also a certain confidence or willpower inside him.\nShang felt like there was no sense in resisting. It was like his own motivation was suppressed by the sheer pressure of his opponent.\nBut Shang wasn't a mere teenager.\nShang had gone through a lot of training, and he had also fought on the world stage on Earth. The pressure he had felt back then was even more oppressive than the pressure he was feeling right now.\nHow? Were his old opponents stronger than the Vice-Dean, Soran?\nOf course not.\nThe circumstances and eventual repercussions were different.\nIf Shang had lost his fights on Earth, his life would have been ruined. He had trained for months on end to succeed in only a single fight, and that fight would decide Shang's entire future.\nBut this fight?\nNothing would happen.\nThis was not a fight that would decide his future, but a fight that would teach Shang something.\nWinning or losing made no difference.\nSo, even when the opponent was the most powerful opponent Shang had ever had, losing wasn't bad. It was expected.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang slowly took out his sword again, and he looked at Soran. \"You said I can attack with the intention to kill, right?\" he asked.\n\"You can,\" Soran answered with a slight nod as he readied his spear.\nBANG!\nThen, Soran suddenly charged forward, taking Shang by surprise.\nShang had expected that Soran would simply block all of Shang's offenses and teach him. But now, he was attacking him!\nFor a moment, it became difficult for Shang to react, but he had an advantage that allowed him to react in time.\nHis body.\nSoran had said that he would make himself two levels weaker than Shang, and he had done so. Soran's speed was more than manageable for Shang, and that was the only reason why Shang was able to react in time.\nSoran's spear directly went for Shang's head, and it became bigger and bigger in Shang's vision.\nShang quickly shot his sword upwards. His plan was to throw the spear to the side with all his power. Since he had a more powerful body at the moment, he could ruin the balance of his opponent by striking the weapon.\nWHOOSH!\nYet, Shang's sword missed!\nSoran only smiled as he slightly pulled his spear back.\nThat was when Shang realized that Soran had already planned this beforehand. Soran wasn't using more power than he was allowed, and he hadn't stopped his spear in a reactionary sense.\nIt had been planned from the very beginning.\nSuddenly, the head of the spear angled downward, the spear bending in the process.\nIn that short moment, Shang realized what had happened.\nSoran had pushed his spear forward at an angle, but before Shang had even decided to block it, Soran had pushed the butt of his spear to the side.\nThe wooden shaft of the spear was very bendy, and the rotation of the actual spear took some time to reach the tip.\nAt this very moment, the butt of the spear was pointing towards Shang's torso while the tip of the spear was slightly pointing to the side. Soran didn't even need to continue pushing. The sheer force of the bent spear would shoot forward as the spear became straight again, catapulting the head of the spear into Shang's abdomen.\nShang couldn't get either of his arms to intercept the spear. Yes, Shang had a more powerful body, and he was definitely also faster, but he hadn't been interrupted by his opponent but by himself.\nShang had wanted to stun his opponent by using all his power to throw the spear to the side. Because of that, Shang had to fight against his own power to regain his balance, not his opponent's power.\nShang couldn't block the head of the spear.\nYet, Shang's eyes narrowed as his instincts took over. These weren't the instincts of an MMA fighter but the instincts of someone that had lived in the wilderness for months, fighting powerful beasts all the time.\nBANG!\nShang was thrown to the side.\nHowever, the eyes of Soran, Viera, and Mervin widened in surprise.\nShang had gone into the attack of his own volition!\nThe first and most basic reaction someone had towards an attack was to protect themselves. If someone saw a punch coming toward their face, they would quickly put their arms in front of their face. If someone saw an attack coming towards their abdomen, they would put their arms and legs in front of their torso while trying to either jump back or turn to the side.\nThese were basic instincts.\nYet, Shang stepped forward while slightly rotating his abdomen.\nIf Shang had done nothing, the spear would have straightened, and the tip would have slightly pierced Shang's abdomen. Soran didn't want to injure Shang too seriously after all.\nBut by stepping forward and rotating, the side of the spear's head slapped Shang in the abdomen. The sharp edge of the spear left a deep cut in Shang's abdomen, but that was it. A thrust with the spear would have punched through Shang if it were performed with the intention to kill, which would obviously be worse than this outcome.\nAt the same time, Shang's arms wrapped around the spear, keeping it from leaving his body.\nShang had the more powerful body, and he had to take advantage of that fact.\nSoran raised an eyebrow as he saw Shang grip his spear with his left hand while still keeping his sword in his right.\nThen, Shang exploded forward!\nHe pulled Soran to him by pulling on the spear as his sword struck in Soran's direction.\nSoran only smirked.\nWhoooop!\nThe spear suddenly bent to the side, throwing Soran to the side. It was almost like the spear was not following physics anymore!\nShang noticed what had happened.\nSoran was using Shang as the base of a lever. Soran was essentially using the principles of a pole vault to throw himself to the side.\nAt the same time, the spear in Shang's hands tried to pull itself out of his grasp. Soran was using the entire power of his body to bend the shaft out of Shang's hands.\nHowever, one of the very first things a fighter on Earth learned was to disarm people. Because of that, Shang used some fingers from his right hand to block the exit of the spear.\nThe part where the fingers curled around something was easy to break out of with some rotation. Shang knew that which was why he was reinforcing that part with his other hand while still keeping his sword.\nSoran nodded in praise when he saw that.\nThen, Soran shoved his spear forward with all his force.\nShang strengthened his grip on the spear and managed to keep hold of it.\nClink!\nYet, the spear vibrated once and hit the hilt of his sword, throwing it out of Shang's hand.\nLike it had a mind of its own, the sword gracefully flew towards Soran, who caught it.\nThen, Soran pointed the sword at Shang with one hand while keeping his spear in the other.\nSilence.\nFor a moment, Shang looked with cold eyes at his sword.\nHe knew that his own sword couldn't injure him. If Shang shot forward, Soran would try to stab Shang with the sword, but it wouldn't work.\nThen, Shang could use that chance to start an unarmed fight on the ground with Soran, which would essentially mean that Shang would win.\n\"You win,\" Shang said.\nBut in the end, Shang decided against it.\nFirst of all, Soran had already shown a cavalcade of techniques, and it was very possible that he would have even more. Saying that Shang would be able to tackle Soran to the ground would be very, very optimistic. In short, Shang's victory wasn't even close to assured.\nSecond, Shang was certain that the ability to not cut one's user wasn't common for a weapon. Shang still wasn't certain how other people would perceive his weapon if they knew of its abilities.\nLastly, Shang also had the ability of his left arm, but he kept it secret for the same reason. If Shang could tell his own affinity, he wouldn't be afraid of revealing it. However, his affinity was special. Even the God had called it special.\nAlso, if Shang used some Mana-related abilities with his left arm, Soran might do the same. Shang didn't forget that Soran had called himself a Mage Warrior, and up to now, Soran hadn't revealed any Magic abilities.\nSoran only smiled as he threw the sword back to Shang.\n\"Well fought, Shang!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 70 - Flaws\n\"Thanks,\" Shang answered Soran.\nWhen Soran heard Shang's words, he nodded in appreciation.\nWhy?\nBecause a lot of kids tried to appear too prideful or motivated. They would proclaim with a frown that they were sad they hadn't won or something similar.\nHowever, that didn't make them seem endearing or motivated but stupid.\nThis had never been a fight where victory was up for grabs. If they said that they weren't fine with losing, it would only show their childishness. It would show that they weren't able to distinguish a winnable fight from an unwinnable one.\nIf someone truly thought like that, the chances were high that they would start a fight they couldn't win, and they would die early. If someone didn't think that but said it regardless, they would only be a people pleaser.\nAccepting when someone was superior to oneself was one of the most important rules a warrior had to learn. It was an essential skill for survival.\n\"Hey, Soran, how about you let the kid actually show his skills?\" Mervin said from his chair. \"This entire fight was supposed to show us his sword skills.\"\nSoran only smiled awkwardly as he scratched the back of his head. \"Sorry. I just wanted to show him how annoying it can be when someone suddenly attacks out of nowhere.\"\n\"Anyway,\" Soran said as he looked at Shang. At the same time, his spear vanished, and he lifted his arms. \"Let's see your sword skills. I won't fight back, but I will block and evade. Just treat my arms as shields. You don't have to worry. By using Mana, my body becomes so hard that you can't damage it.\"\nShang nodded as he readied his sword.\nAt the same time, the other three threw glances at Shang's abdomen.\nThere was still a cut on Shang's abdomen, but it was quickly healing.\nThis told the teachers two things.\nFirst of all, Shang acted like he didn't even notice his injury, which gave more credibility to his claims of how he was training his body.\nSecond, Shang's injury was already closing, which meant that he had a warrior's body.\nWhat was a warrior's body?\nIn this world, a warrior's body was seen as a disadvantage. In essence, having a warrior's body meant that one wasn't able to actively push Mana towards one's mind. Without a way to actively push Mana towards one's Spirit, one wasn't able to become a Mage.\nOf course, in a world where Magic was the only way to true power, this was a bad thing.\nIt wasn't entirely impossible to practice Magic with a warrior's body, but it basically made no sense.\nWhy?\nBecause the mind would only become more powerful by the passive Mana-radiation of the strengthened body. In short, this meant that one's body had to vastly surpass one's mind in power to strengthen it.\nMages trained by pushing their Mana into their minds. In the beginning, Mages would retain normal bodies until they became Adepts. When they became Adepts, the power of their mind would slowly strengthen their bodies.\nThis meant that an Early Adept would have a body equal to an Early Soldier Stage warrior.\nThat was an entire Realm lower.\nOf course, one could also train both at the same time, but that would consume double the resources and double the time for only a minuscule increase in strength.\nSomeone with a warrior's body would be forced into training the opposite way.\nIf they wanted to become Mages, they would need to become a warrior in the General Stage first before they could start learning Magic. When the warrior had already reached the Second Realm, they could learn to cast spells at the same levels as a beginner Apprentice.\nIn short, it made no sense.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Someone with a warrior's body was essentially forced into the path of a warrior.\nHowever, having a warrior's body wasn't only a bad thing. The good thing about having a warrior's body was that the body kept most of its Mana stored in the body itself, not the mind.\nThis gave the person with the warrior's body a faster rate of regeneration.\nHow many people had a warrior's body?\nAround 2% of the students in the academy.\nIt was a bit more common outside the academy since a lot of peasants were peasants because they couldn't practice Magic.\nBut, of course, the academy still preferred students that had a warrior's body. After all, this was an academy for warriors.\nWhile the watchers were taking note of Shang's injury, Shang began to unleash a relentless offense on Soran.\nShang shot forward and quickly unleashed a slash, which was blocked by Soran's arm.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nShang attacked more and more times as Soran jumped around the room to keep Shang on his toes.\nSoran was even jumping on the table, the backs of chairs, and other furniture.\nShang, obviously, jumped after him every single time, also using the environment to his advantage.\nSurprisingly, no furniture got damaged.\nOne would think that with Shang's instincts and offensive, he would destroy the furniture. After all, it wasn't his style to hold himself back.\nAnd that was true. He wasn't holding himself back.\nSo, why was the furniture not damaged?\nControl.\nA good warrior had to realize when they had to stop their attack and adapt.\nIf the enemy didn't evade, a good warrior wouldn't hit the surroundings. Their attacks would hit the enemy.\nIf the enemy evaded, it made no sense to continue the attack, which would result in Shang not hitting the furniture.\nOnly someone that wasn't able to take in their surroundings and adapt to them would mindlessly continue attacking when they couldn't hit the enemy.\nWhen the other two teachers saw that, they nodded in appreciation again.\nUp to now, Shang had shown extraordinary habits and battle instincts.\nThese were the habits of someone that had been in many real fights in their life.\nHowever, they had also noticed some glaring flaws in Shang's style of battle, which showed that Shang hadn't truly fought humans before and that he hadn't been in a truly chaotic battle before.\nThey suspected that Shang had only fought beasts in one-on-one duels before.\nSoran decided that they had seen enough to make a judgment, but he still wanted to show Shang one of his glaring flaws.\nSoran stopped in front of a column.\nShang attacked Soran, and Soran blocked the attack with his left forearm.\nThen, Soran lightly stepped to the side.\nShang wanted to charge after him.\nBANG!\nSuddenly, Shang's vision warped violently as white stars sprung up everywhere.\nOut of reflex, Shang jumped backward but fell over. One of his hands went to his head.\nShang felt blood coming from his head.\nShang looked to the place where he had just been and saw a thick vase made of stone rolling to the side, a bloody spot on it.\nWhen Shang had attacked Soran near the column, Soran's foot had slightly shaken the column.\nThe vase above the column tipped over, and it fell on Shang's head.\nThat thing was hard and heavy.\nThis was one of Shang's glaring flaws.\nThe enemy fully consumed his vision and mind, making him blind to his surroundings. Shang could still see how his enemy interacted with the surroundings, and he could also use the surroundings to his advantage, but that only included the surroundings immediately involved in the battle.\nShang wasn't paying attention to anything else, and he wasn't thinking about checking his surroundings from time to time or listening to the noises.\nIf Shang had been paying attention, he could have heard the column behind Soran shake.\nSadly, his vision had been consumed by Soran.\n\"Alright,\" Soran said with a smile. \"That should be enough.\"\n\"Want to hear your evaluation?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 71 - Feedback\n\"Yes,\" Shang answered as he slowly stood up.\nShang had always wanted an evaluation from a neutral party. After all, he could evaluate himself only to a certain degree.\nAnd on top of that, Shang had already been given some feedback just now.\nHis headwound was proof of that.\n'I didn't notice such a huge vase coming towards my head. Now that I think back, I can remember hearing the column shake, but I simply filtered it out as irrelevant information.'\n'I guess that's the Vice-Dean's way of showing me that I ignored my surroundings. I can get why that is a bad habit on a battlefield.'\n\"Alright,\" Soran said as he sat back down in his chair. \"Then, let's talk about your sword techniques first. Mervin?\" Soran asked as he looked at the older man beside him.\nMervin nodded and looked at Shang.\n\"Horrible.\"\nSilence.\nShang was waiting for more, but nothing more came. \"Could you elaborate?\" Shang asked.\n\"Your movements are fast, but that's it,\" Mervin answered. \"You plan your next strike very well, and you unleash your strike with quite some speed, but there is no after. You fight like you only think about the current strike and not the one after that or the one after that.\"\n\"When something goes wrong with your current attack, you hesitate and pause for a moment because you're unsure about what you should do next. In essence, you are planning your attack only when it's already time to unleash it, not beforehand.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Another thing is that your attacks have no nuance. Your attacks are all very straightforward and honest. What the enemies see is what they get. You don't use feints, and you don't use your sword to manipulate the enemy's perception.\"\n\"Lastly, your only goal in attacking your opponent is to kill them. However, that is the end goal, and it can't always be achieved with one strike. Oftentimes, you have to achieve multiple subgoals in order to finally take your enemy's life.\"\nThen, Mervin stood up and walked past the table.\nThe other two smiled a bit when they saw him get up of his own volition. Obviously, the youngster had woken up Mervin's teacher instincts.\nMervin took out his sword and held it in front of him as he looked at Shang. \"Can you take me out with one attack if I had your physical power?\" he asked.\nShang looked at Mervin. \"No,\" he quickly answered.\nMervin's sword perfectly isolated him from everything in front of him. At first glance, he didn't seem to hold his sword in any special way, but Shang felt like Mervin's defense was impenetrable.\n\"Why not?\" Mervin asked.\n\"Because of your sword,\" Shang answered.\n\"Can you get rid of my sword?\" Mervin asked.\n\"Difficult,\" Shang answered.\n\"So, what would you need to do?\"\nShang's brows furrowed. \"I would need to keep attacking you and shake your balance until I get the chance to either directly strike you or get rid of your weapon.\"\nMervin nodded. \"Correct,\" he answered. \"I noticed that you realize these things rather quickly in a fight, but you don't realize them immediately. You first have to try something before you know that it doesn't work.\"\n\"You are essentially a beast in your fighting style,\" Mervin said as he put his sword away again and went back to his chair. \"You are fighting honest, direct, and without a plan, just like a beast.\"\n\"The good thing with that style is that many enemies might become overwhelmed by your sheer killing intent. After all, your attacks very directly show that you are there to kill them and that you are not messing around.\"\n\"However, that style only works on inexperienced soldiers. Someone that can actually keep their calm in a battle will be your downfall. They will notice your very simple attacks and goals, and they will lead the battle into a losing direction for you.\"\n\"Imagine you attack your enemy, and they block. Then, they attack, and you block. Then, you attack again, and they block. And then, they attack. Suddenly, you are with your back to a wall, and blocking from your current position is difficult. You would much rather evade. However, you can't evade due to the wall.\"\n\"Without planning and without paying attention to the surroundings, something like that can happen to you,\" Mervin said. \"The enemy follows their plan, and they will push you into an unfavorable position. As a warrior, you have to be able to see these things and plan around them.\"\n\"You fight like a beast, but you are a human. You are not using our strongest weapon, which is our superior mind.\"\n\"Nearly all of these things can be easily fixed by learning a couple of sword techniques. After all, these techniques are specifically created to avoid such situations. There are attacks that are perfect to use if you feel pressured. There are attacks that are perfectly suited to pressure your opponent.\"\n\"By comprehending all these techniques, you will subconsciously already plan against your opponent.\"\n\"But as it stands right now, your sword techniques are only fit for slaughtering beasts, not humans, and a warrior that can't fight humans is a warrior that won't live for very long.\"\nAfter that sentence, Mervin became silent.\nShang listened intently to Mervin's barrage of words with burning eyes.\nYes, this was what he was here for!\nFeedback!\nTeachings!\nMervin was completely right in everything that he said!\nShang hadn't truly fought a powerful human yet, but Shang could very well imagine how such a fight would go down. It would probably go down exactly as Mervin predicted.\nHumans were using many tricky techniques that Shang wasn't used to handling. A good example was Soran's swing with his spear. Soran had seemingly attacked Shang's face, and Shang had reacted. Yet, Soran had actually attacked Shang's torso.\nOne had to remember that Soran had made his body two levels weaker than Shang. This meant that Shang was much faster than Soran in this situation.\nThe most impressive part was that this strike wasn't even very hard to pull off. Shang could imagine such a strike to be a basic technique of a spear user. It wasn't some heavenly technique that one could only comprehend after having been a warrior for decades.\nIt was a simple application of a weapon, and if it were an actual battle, Shang would have been in life-threatening danger.\nBy whom?\nBy someone two levels below him.\nWhy?\nBecause Shang hadn't fought humans yet, and because he hadn't learned from humans yet.\n\"Thank you for your teachings,\" Shang said with respect as he slightly bowed in respect.\nMervin only snorted. \"Don't mention it. I just couldn't watch someone fight this atrociously.\"\nThen, Soran looked at Shang. \"Are you fine with that feedback?\" he asked with a smile.\nShang nodded. \"Yes, just these few words have highlighted many of my mistakes and bad habits.\"\nSoran nodded. \"It's good that you have such a mindset. Honestly, it's rather rare to see someone have such a mature mindset at your age.\"\nSoran chuckled a bit. \"It's almost like you're already in your 20s.\"\nShang didn't answer.\n\"Anyway, let's talk about your mentality,\" Soran said.",

      "content": "Chapter 72 - Pain\nSoran paused a bit.\n\"Your instincts are terrifyingly good for someone of your age,\" Soran said.\nShang nodded.\n\"In our fight, when you suddenly noticed my spear coming towards you, you immediately found a creative way to mitigate the damage. You obviously haven't seen the attack coming, and you certainly have been surprised by it. I saw it in your face.\"\n\"However, out of pure instinct, you managed to find a quick and good solution to your predicament. At that moment, you didn't have the time to think of a plan because you were lacking time, but by acting on your instincts, you managed to find a solution in that tiny moment.\"\n\"Such battle instincts can't be taught. They can only be built by going through several genuine life-threatening battles. Those are the instincts of a seasoned warrior, and they are the most important thing for any warrior.\"\n\"However, relying upon instincts should be the last thing you should do,\" Soran explained. \"You should only rely on your instincts when your planning no longer works, and you can only rely on them when you literally have no time to plan.\"\n\"You could say that the instincts are a last, life-saving measure. They are essentially your very last defense. However, if you need to rely on your instincts, it means you are already in a losing position. After all, if you weren't in a very disadvantageous position, you would have time to plan your attacks, which means not relying on your instincts.\"\n\"But the good thing is that you are good in something that we can't teach, which gives you a major edge over the other students.\"\nSoran took the papers in front of him and straightened them out into one pile, showing that he no longer planned on writing more down.\n\"In summary, you are an uncut diamond,\" Soran said with a smile. \"You're not good in the things we can teach, but you are very good in the things we can't teach. If we teach you everything we can teach you, you will be good at literally everything.\"\n\"That's our evaluation.\"\nShang looked at Soran. \"So, am I accepted?\" he asked.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Soran only smiled. \"There are two more things we need to verify, but if you have been honest, those will only be a formality.\"\nShang nodded. \"Which things?\"\n\"First of all, I need to test the quality of your body,\" Soran said as he stood up again and walked around the table.\nHe approached Shang. \"Just continue standing there. It might be a bit uncomfortable, but bear with me.\"\nSoran put his left arm on Shang's shoulder while his right arm pressed on multiple spots on Shang's torso.\nShang was reminded of the routine doctor appointments on Earth. When he complained about trouble in his intestines, the doctors also pressed down on his abdomen in a similar manner.\nShang didn't feel anything when Soran pressed onto his abdomen.\nSoran nodded in appreciation.\nThen, Soran went to the sides of Shang's abdomen and pressed on his kidneys and liver.\nShang didn't show any reaction, and Soran nodded again.\nNext, Soran checked Shang's stomach and lungs. There were also no issues there.\nViera and Mervin threw some surprised glances at each other.\n\"Argh,\" Shang suddenly groaned as his vision blurred for a bit.\n\"Just as I've thought,\" Soran said with a smile after pulling his hands back. \"This basically confirms your claims.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Shang asked.\n\"About how you managed to train your body to such a powerful stage at such a young age,\" Soran answered. \"It's hard to fathom, but the proof stands right in front of me.\"\n\"All your organs have been strengthened to the peak of the Soldier Stage except for your heart. With normal methods, that's impossible.\"\nSoran looked at Shang with a concerned, raised eyebrow. \"However, it's also sad in a way. You seem to only be about fourteen or fifteen years old, but you managed to get through so much pain.\"\nThen, Soran frowned. \"And the worst thing is that you did it willingly.\"\n\"How is that a bad thing?\" Shang asked with a skeptical expression. \"Shouldn't that be a positive? After all, it shows that I can get through any hardships placed before me, and it proves how much I am willing to sacrifice for my own strength.\"\nSoran sighed. \"Exactly that is the problem,\" he said. \"Your perception of yourself and your surroundings is warped.\"\nShang only looked with skepticism at Soran.\n\"You are so used to going through so much pain to become powerful that it will be hard for you to find like-minded individuals,\" Soran explained. \"Listen, Shang. It's not necessary to go through as much pain as you. There are easier ways to train your body.\"\n\"These ways can still be quite painful but obviously not nearly as painful as you have experienced. However, other kids and adults will perceive these ways to be quite painful while you won't.\"\n\"If you publicly make it known that you don't perceive these things as painful, you are indirectly calling everyone else a crybaby, which will isolate you.\"\n\"Additionally, your cold attitude towards yourself will also inevitably reflect on your surroundings.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Shang asked.\nSoran sighed.\n\"For example, you haven't smiled, laughed, or chuckled even once ever since I got to know you,\" Soran said.\nFor some reason, Shang felt his insides shake a little when he heard that.\n\"You are a teenager, and you've just been praised by several very powerful warriors in the Commander Stage. You also managed to win against a student of ours.\"\n\"Any of these things would excite someone, especially someone as young as you.\"\n\"Yet, you always only looked with either an emotionless expression at us or one filled with skepticism.\"\nViera and Mervin also had concerned expressions on their faces.\n\"You also don't even try to fake it. You don't put on a polite smile or anything like that. Do you know what that shows me?\"\nSilence.\n\"It shows me that you don't care about what anyone else thinks. Don't get me wrong. That can be good to a certain extent, but if you're overdoing it, this will isolate you.\"\n\"Do you know what you look like to me?\" Soran asked.\nShang felt a bit uncomfortable, and he didn't know how to answer.\n\"Like a kid that has gone through so much pain that it can't build a connection with other humans anymore.\"\n\"And that's very sad, but also very dangerous.\"\n\"Because, if you become an adult, what will you become?\"\n\"What choices will you make when you have power over other people?\"\n\"What choices will someone make that has no meaningful connection with anyone else?\"\nSoran sighed again.\n\"Listen, Shang,\" he said. \"You don't need to go through this suicidal training you have been going through for months. It might train your body faster than any other method, but it will damage your mentality.\"\n\"You shouldn't sacrifice your future for an expedited path to power. You have enough time, and you don't need to try so hard.\"\n\"Look at us,\" Soran said as he gestured to himself and the other two. \"We are already well within the Commander Stage, and we are all still young. We can all still laugh, and we have all gone through more battles than you can imagine.\"\n\"We are very experienced, and if we were subpar warriors, we wouldn't be teachers in the most prestigious academy for warriors in the world. We essentially reached the realistically achievable peak of the warrior's path, and we didn't have to go through as much pain in such a short time as you.\"\n\"Remember one thing, Shang,\" Soran said. \"It is not the outside world forcing you down this path but yourself. As long as you don't force yourself down this path, no one will force you.\"\nSoran sighed again.\n\"Honestly, if it were up to me, I wouldn't accept you into the academy. As you appear right now, I fear giving you power. In my perception, when you gain power, you will bring a lot of suffering to a lot of innocent people.\"\n\"However, the decision isn't up to me.\"\nSoran stood up as he took the pile of papers with him. \"Could one of you two please deal with the last part of the exam? I'll deliver the papers to Master.\"\n\"I'll deal with it,\" Mervin said as he stood up. \"Come, Shang. It's time for the practical exam.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 73 - Smile?\nSoran left the room to report to his Master, which was probably the dean, Shang assumed.\nViera went back to whatever she was doing, and Mervin pulled Shang along with him.\nMervin led Shang to the gates of the academy, and they quickly left it.\nBy now, Shang could see a busy city, a far cry from the dead city he had seen at night.\nShang could hear the constant hitting of hammers, the roaring fires in bakeries and forges, and many people loudly trading with each other on the streets.\nEven more, nearly every person on the streets wore armor and weapons, showing that they were warriors.\nMervin and Shang then left the city without saying anything. When the guards saw Mervin, they simply shot him a greeting and let him pass.\nThen, the two of them ran down the long street, which was filled with many different carts. The carts were all filled with different wares.\n\"You should listen to Soran,\" Mervin said suddenly.\nShang didn't answer.\nEver since Soran had said that Shang hadn't smiled even once, Shang had fallen into thought.\nHe still remembered his time on Earth. Back then, he had been a very extroverted and outgoing person. He had enjoyed smiling and being amongst others.\nShang had also smiled quite a bit when he had been in this world. His interactions with the villagers of Coldew Village had felt natural. Shang had smiled politely, and he had laughed with them a little bit.\nWhen had all of this stopped?\nWhen had he stopped smiling?\nIt wasn't hard to find the moment.\nIt was when Shang had killed the beggars and when he had decided to kill off his old persona.\nHe didn't remember his old name anymore, and he also didn't care. He no longer was this person.\nYet, was Shang truly the person he wanted to be?\n\"I don't know,\" Shang said. \"It's a lot to think about.\"\n\"That's a good thing,\" Mervin said. \"If your feelings have been thrown out of equilibrium by Soran's words, it means there is still hope for you.\"\n\"Listen, being more open and less self-destructive isn't only a good thing for the people around you but also for you. It makes it far easier to interact with the world, and you will find your way forward easier.\"\n\"People generally don't want to help someone they feel is dangerous or apathetic. By being as you are now, you will find it harder to get the resources you need in the future. At some point, the traders have enough wealth and power to choose their customers. There is far more demand than supply for their wares.\"\n\"When you can sell your supply to anyone you want, you will sell it to someone you enjoy the company of. Sure, you can probably also buy these supplies, but you would need to pay a hefty premium.\"\n\"Additionally, there are techniques and resources you can only acquire by being part of an organization, and many of them put a lot of value on cooperation. We humans are not lonesome beings. One of our biggest strengths is the ability to work together. Someone who appears apathetic and hard to get along with is not the first choice for these organizations.\"\n\"You are still young, Shang,\" Mervin said. \"You have plenty of time to change. The only thing standing in your way is you.\"\n\"I'm also certain that you can change. After all, if you were truly as cold and apathetic as you appear, Soran's words wouldn't have had an effect on you.\"\n\"But in the end, it's up to you. You can listen to my words or simply treat them as the ramblings of an old man,\" Mervin said.\nShang had silently listened to Mervin's words, and he was honestly thinking about them.\nShang had also noticed that Mervin was truly someone that cared about others. He tried to act like a grumpy old man, but he actually wanted to help his students.\nMervin obviously didn't like talking too much, but he had said so much to Shang in such a short time, which showed that he definitely cared about Shang's development.\nFor a moment, Shang wasn't certain what he should say.\nShould he thank him?\nShould he start a discussion with him?\nShould he smile and tell him that he will try to put these changes into effect?\nIn the end, Shang did nothing.\nAll of these potential reactions felt like they weren't important.\nSo, the two of them only continued jogging in silence down the road.\nMervin noticed with furrowed brows that Shang didn't react, and he silently sighed.\nShang hadn't given Mervin an answer, but Mervin saw Shang's answer by his inaction.\nIn a way, pleasing Mervin was something that would help Shang in the long run. After all, Mervin was an experienced teacher, and the better their relationship, the more Mervin would be willing to teach Shang.\nShang obviously knew that, and Mervin knew that Shang knew that.\nYet, Shang didn't even make an attempt at pleasing him.\nAt this moment, one had to pay attention that one didn't understand Mervin incorrectly. Mervin wasn't someone that liked it when people tried to please him. This was not what he was concerned about.\nThe thing he was concerned about was Shang's inability to try to make his life easier.\nIt was so easy for Shang to make his life easier.\nHe only had to thank Mervin for his advice.\nThat was it.\nWhat was so hard about doing that? It was simply a mere formality.\nYet, Shang didn't say anything.\nJust going through this tiny formality could make his life so much easier, but he didn't even do that.\nIt was like Shang was actively trying to make his own life harder and trying to make himself unlikable on purpose.\nOf course, Mervin knew that this was not Shang's intention. However, this was the effect of Shang's actions, intended or not.\nOf course, Shang also knew these things. He had lived on Earth, and being polite was something very basic that everyone could do. Back then, Shang had been polite to his teachers, strangers, customers, his employers, and everyone else.\nSaying please and thank you was normal.\nGiving a mere polite smile was normal.\nBut now, Shang didn't even do that, even though he had learned these principles and lived by them for his entire life.\nShang realized these things. He had a great affinity for introspection, which allowed him to analyze himself from a detached, objective perspective.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ He had noticed that he appeared very uncooperative at this moment, and he knew that this could make his life harder in the future.\nYet, for some reason, Shang simply felt like it wasn't important.\nIt felt like it was too much work for too little return.\nHowever, Shang also knew that this basically didn't count as work. How could a couple of perfunctory words and a light smile be called work?\n'What's wrong with me?' Shang thought in uncertainty. 'This shouldn't be hard, but for some reason, it feels so hard.'\n'I don't want to smile, and it feels like work.'\n'Why? Why does it feel like so much work?'\n\"We're here,\" Mervin said as he stopped.\nShang had been occupied with his thoughts, and he hadn't noticed where they had gone to.\nAt the moment, Shang stood in front of the Wild Forest. Shang remembered that the Wild Forest was filled with beasts in the First Realm, the Soldier Stage.\nWas he supposed to kill a beast?\n\"Kill a Pest Cat,\" Mervin ordered.\n\"When you've killed a Pest Cat, you will be accepted into the academy.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 74 - Not About Can, But Should\nWhen Shang heard what he had to do, his mind quickly changed directions.\nHe put his earlier thoughts to the back of his mind as his old instincts from the wilderness returned.\nWithout saying anything, Shang shot towards the Wild Forest. Mervin watched him from afar and slowly followed him from a distance.\nAs soon as Shang reached the first tree, he jumped to one of the branches in near-perfect silence. Then, he simply jumped from branch to branch with practiced ease.\nShang looked at the ground of the forest for the entire time while always quickly checking the tree he would jump to next.\nShang hadn't even realized that Mervin had essentially made it harder for Shang than necessary.\nPest Cats were only active at night. Right now, it was morning, and the sun was already shining down from above. This meant that the Pest Cats were hiding inside their nests, which were nearly impossible to find for someone that didn't know about the Pest Cats' habits.\nWhen Mervin saw the methodical method at which Shang was searching for the Pest Cats, he sighed.\nHe wanted to teach Shang a lesson. Shang had acted in a self-destructive way by not at least pretending to be polite, and Mervin wanted to make it a bit harder for Shang as a lesson.\nAction and consequence.\nShang wanted to make his life harder? Sure, Mervin would comply and make it a bit harder.\nHowever, Mervin had underestimated Shang.\nShang had been living in the wilderness for over half a year, and he had been forced to learn the habits of the beasts around him. After all, if he didn't, a Pest Cat might have jumped out at him from its nest if he didn't notice it prior to that.\nPest Cats might only be active and hunt at night, but if some prey decided to directly stroll right past its home, it wouldn't decline the meal.\nAfter a couple of minutes of jumping from tree to tree, Shang noticed some dried drops of blood on the ground.\nPest Cats hunted every single night because they needed a lot of food to produce offspring. Pest Cats were famous for their astounding ability to reproduce quickly.\nWhen Pest Cats hunted at night, they carried their prey to their burrow to consume it over the day. The Pest Cats had an impressively fast metabolism, and their stomachs were very efficient in digesting food.\nHowever, there was still only so much Pest Cats could eat at once, and they often hunted rather big prey.\nBecause of that, they had to eat their prey over half a day, one stomach-load at a time.\nAfter around a minute of following the trail, Shang found an area with light scratch marks and some dried blood here and there.\nShang looked over, and he saw a small but wide hole below a tree. The hole looked like an enlarged version of a mailbox's slit, thin and wide.\nDue to their form, Pest Cats could make themselves very small while still being able to move very quickly.\nWhen Shang found the small hole, he looked at the tree from all sides. Sure enough, there was another slit on its other side.\nShang didn't climb onto the tree above the two slits since the Pest Cat would be able to feel the vibrations.\nThen, from the other tree, Shang readied himself.\nSHING!\nShang threw his sword towards the entrance of one of the slits. His sword hit the ground in front of the slit and vibrated.\nShang looked at the other slit and readied himself.\nBANG!\nSuddenly, Shang heard a commotion from the other slit, and he looked over with some surprise.\nThe Pest Cat had jumped out of the first slit and had attacked the space above the sword, which was something Shang had not expected.\nHowever, Shang quickly adapted and shot toward the Pest Cat by pushing himself off the tree with all his power.\nThe tree creaked under the power of Shang's legs, and Shang shot with incredible speed right at the Pest Cat.\nThe Pest Cat was still confused about why there was no enemy in front of it, but it was already too late.\nBANG!\nShang's kick hit the Pest Cat's spine near its chest, easily breaking it.\nThe Pest Cat collapsed, and Shang also broke its neck. His body was more powerful, which made it rather easy for him to kill it from such a position.\nThe task had been completed.\n\"Well done,\" Mervin said as he silently appeared beside Shang. \"You can go back to the academy. I'll quickly catch up with you.\"\nShang looked at the corpse below him. \"What about the corpse?\" he asked.\n\"You can keep it or sell it to the academy,\" Mervin said. \"By keeping it, you can sell it for gold. By selling it to the academy, you can get some contribution points.\"\nSHING!\nSomething appeared in Mervin's hands.\nIt was a large, black blanket.\n\"That's a Beast Sack. As its name implies, it's something to transport beasts. You can't just drag a bloody corpse through the streets of the cities since that would make the entire city stink of blood and guts. That's why you have to carry it inside a Beast Sack. They're inexpensive, and they're meant to be used only one time,\" Mervin explained. \"You can have that one.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang nodded. \"Thanks,\" he said absentmindedly as he grabbed the Beast Sack and put it around the corpse of the Pest Cat.\nShang didn't think of his actions, but Mervin noticed it.\n'Interesting,' Mervin thought. 'Earlier, he had issues with thanking me, but now, he does it easily.'\n\"No problem,\" Mervin said. \"Get on with it. I still have something to do.\"\nHowever, Shang didn't go, and he looked at the burrow of the Pest Cat. \"Are you going to deal with the offspring?\"\nMervin frowned. \"That's not something you have to be concerned over. You've done your task, and that's that.\"\nShang looked at Mervin with a neutral expression. \"Do you think I can't deal with the image of several babies being killed?\"\nMervin's frown deepened. \"It's not about being able to deal with it or not,\" he said. \"It's about if you should or not. Even if you can deal with it, you shouldn't have to. You are a new student, and you aren't even an adult. Killing a dangerous enemy is different from killing something that is no danger and hasn't threatened you.\"\nAs Shang heard Mervin's words, he got reminded of the night he had killed the several beggars.\nShang rarely thought of the night since thinking about it always made him uncomfortable.\nMervin noticed that Shang's eyes became absentminded for a second when he said that, and Mervin quickly realized what that meant.\n'He has already done something like that before,' Mervin thought without changing his expression. 'That explains quite a lot.'\n\"Go,\" Mervin ordered.\nShang threw one more glance at the burrow.\nAs soon as he had seen the Pest Cat jump out of the wrong hole, Shang had realized that it had probably offspring in its nest. That was the only explanation he could come up with.\nPest Cats in the Wild Forest should be used to humans, and humans should be the biggest danger around here. No sane Pest Cat would attack a human with a weapon that had suddenly appeared in front of its nest.\nUnless it had something to protect.\nIn the end, Shang took a deep breath, put the Beast Sack over his shoulders, and walked off.\nFor some reason, it was rather difficult for Shang to just leave like this.\nWhen Shang had left, Mervin looked at the burrow of the Pest Cat with narrowed eyes.\nThen, a green bottle appeared in his hands, and he poured the contents into the hole.\nAfter making sure nothing left the burrow, he left the forest and caught up with Shang.\nThe job was done.",

      "content": "Chapter 75 - Realms\nA couple of minutes after Shang left the Wild Forest, Mervin caught up to him. Shang didn't ask Mervin how it went since there was no point to the question.\n\"Are you planning to sell the corpse or give it to the academy?\" Mervin asked.\n\"Academy,\" Shang answered.\n\"What's your choice based on?\"\n\"I have enough gold,\" Shang said. \"Speaking of gold, I haven't paid the fee for the exam yet.\"\n\"You don't have to,\" Mervin said.\nShang's eyebrows rose in surprise. \"What do you mean? I thought I needed to pay five gold.\"\n\"The fee is only there to stop weak warriors from wasting our time,\" Mervin explained. \"Weak warriors have issues with getting so much gold. Of course, we still get some requests from some rich kids. That can't be helped.\"\n\"But when they inevitably fail, they will at least reimburse us for the time wasted. In short, you only need to pay if you fail the exam. You obviously didn't.\"\nShang thought about Mervin's words, and he realized that Mervin's words made a lot of sense, but there was still something that irked him.\n\"But why are you not accepting the gold from the ones that manage to succeed in the exam?\" Shang asked. \"Doesn't the academy need gold?\"\n\"No, it doesn't,\" Mervin said. \"95% of our spending goes to the support of the teachers. You have to remember that the teachers in the academy are still interested in becoming more powerful, and the academy gives them resources to support them in this endeavor. Of course, they have to teach the students in exchange.\"\n\"Okay, but that doesn't explain why you don't need money,\" Shang said. \"After all, you have to pay the teachers.\"\n\"Warriors at the Commander Stage are the most elite warriors you can find,\" Mervin explained. \"Nearly all the teachers belong to some kind of organization or power. The academy isn't directly paying them but giving them access to valuable resources. The only thing the teachers get is the ability to purchase these resources. We are essentially spending zero money on them.\"\nShang's eyebrows rose. \"So, the teachers are only working in exchange for some kind of membership for some exclusive shop?\"\nMervin snorted. \"The wares the teachers have access to are of the highest quality,\" he explained. \"There are expensive and rare pills and tonics from all across the world. There are weapons and techniques that are exclusive to some countries and organizations. There are ores and materials deep from inside danger zones.\"\n\"And most importantly, there are materials from beasts in the True Path Stage.\"\n\"True Path Stage?\" Shang asked.\n\"That's the name of the Fourth Realm for warriors,\" Mervin said. \"It's the equivalent of a High Mage. The name comes from our dean. Since he is the first warrior that reached the True Path Stage, he got to name it.\"\n\"The first three Realms are named after the jobs the warriors took up for the Mages. Warriors in the Soldier Stage are mostly soldiers. Warriors in the General Stage are mostly officers. Warriors in the Commander Stage are the leaders of the armies.\"\n\"However, in the eyes of the Mages, that's it. The highest a warrior can ever become is the leader of an army.\"\n\"They can't become nobles or leaders of actual organizations. They can only lead armies.\"\nThen, Mervin smirked.\n\"That was until the dean managed to break the mold. He was the first that managed to step out of the Realm of being a servant and managed to step onto the very level of actually important leaders.\"\nShang's mind imagined the power and prestige of the dean.\nThe first person that managed to speak to the Mages eye-to-eye.\nHowever, Shang's brows furrowed as he remembered something.\n'The God has asked me nine questions, and I get one answer after every major breakthrough,' Shang thought. 'I am in the First Realm, and I have gotten the answer to my first question. I will most likely receive my second answer when I reach the Second Realm.'\n'Yet, there are nine questions and nine answers.'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Is there a Realm above the High Mage Realm?\" Shang asked.\nMervin frowned. \"Why are you suddenly so interested in Mages?\" he asked with a snort.\n\"Because, since the dean is the strongest warrior, we don't know if there is an after. However, the Mages should know if there is an after,\" Shang asked.\nFor a bit, Mervin remained silent.\n\"Fine,\" he said. \"Yes, there is a Realm after the High Mage Realm. It's called the Archmage Realm, and it's the most powerful Realm in existence.\"\n\"I've heard that you met Duke Whirlwind before. Duke Whirlwind is a High Mage, and he is the ruler over three Zones, the Ice Wyvern Zone, the Storm Eagle Zone, and the Empress Cobra Zone.\"\n\"The Whirlwind Duchy is theoretically an autonomous Duchy, but it unofficially belongs to the Skythunder Kingdom. The King of the Skythunder Kingdom is an Archmage,\" Mervin explained.\nShang's mind quickly went to the most logical question. \"Are there also Emperors?\" he asked.\n\"No,\" Mervin answered. \"In order to be crowned an Emperor, someone would need to reach an even higher Realm. For the past thousands of years, the goal of every King has been to become an Emperor.\"\n\"But no one has succeeded up to now.\"\nBy now, Shang and Mervin had already entered Warrior's Paradise again, and they were in front of the gate of the academy.\nShang didn't ask any further questions, but he fell into thought again.\n'The Archmage Realm would count as the fifth Realm, but that would only answer my fifth question. There are still four more to go.'\nShang threw a covert look to Mervin.\n'That's probably the extent of what he knows. I don't know why, but not even a warrior at the Commander Stage knows what's beyond the Fifth Realm.'\n'I'm unsure if Duke Whirlwind knows about the Realm beyond the Archmage Realm, but for now, I should assume that everyone believes that the Archmages are the most powerful Mages in existence.'\n'But one thing is certain, there are at least eight Realms to being a Mage. I'm not sure if there are truly nine or if the last question was simply a hail Mary from the God to get me to reach a place no one has been in before.'\n'However, one thing is certain. There are at least three more Realms after the Archmage Realm.'\n'Yet, funnily enough, the strongest warrior in the world is the dean. I don't believe that the God has lied to me about that.'\n'The people in this country believe that the dean has managed to step out of the rank of servants and look the Mages into the eyes, but they don't realize the true power of the Mages.'\n'The dean is in the fourth Realm.'\n'The strongest Mage is, at least, in the eighth Realm.'\n'The most powerful Mages probably look at the dean as an especially outstanding child. He's very impressive for a child, but he's just that, a child.'\nAs Shang and Mervin stepped through the gates of the academy, they saw Soran waiting for them.\nSoran saw the Beast Sack on Shang's shoulder and nodded.\n\"Put that to the side for now,\" Soran said, gesturing to the Beast Sack. \"You have more important things to do.\"\n\"The dean wants to see you.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 76 - The Dean\nWhen Mervin heard that, his eyebrows shot up in surprise.\nShang was also quite surprised. \"The dean wants to see me?\" he asked.\nSoran nodded. \"Follow me,\" he said as he turned around.\nShang looked at Mervin, but Mervin only shrugged. \"I wanted to show you where you can deliver the corpse to, but I might as well do that for you now. I will add the contribution points to your emblem when you get it.\"\nShang nodded. He guessed that the emblem Mervin referred to was probably some form of identification, similar to the ID cards in companies on Earth.\nShang handed the Beast Sack over to Mervin and followed Soran.\nSoran led Shang to the side of a hallway and up some flights of stairs.\n\"Why does the dean want to see me? Is that normal for new students?\" Shang asked.\n\"I don't know, and no,\" Soran said. \"Usually, It's either the other Vice-Dean that welcomes the new students or me. The dean doesn't come into contact with students much.\"\nSome seconds of silence passed as they climbed up another flight of stairs.\n\"So, am I part of the academy now?\" Shang asked.\n\"That's up to the dean,\" Soran answered. \"I gave him the report, but before he gave his okay, he told me to bring you to him.\"\nShang didn't answer as his brows furrowed.\nWhy would the dean want to meet him?\nSure, Shang had great instincts, but Soran and Mervin were acting like this was something unusual. If it were normal for talented students to meet the dean, they wouldn't have acted in such a manner.\nWhen they reached the fifth floor, the highest floor, the two of them went back to the hallway.\n\"This floor is reserved for the teachers,\" Soran explained. \"Students are forbidden from accessing this floor without being accompanied by a teacher.\"\nShang looked around, and he noticed that there were not that many doors. He guessed that the rooms beyond the doors were probably rather sizable.\nThe two of them walked to the big gates at the end of the hallway and stopped before them.\n\"Come in,\" someone said from beyond the door. Shang thought that the voice sounded like the voice of a middle-aged man. The voice reminded him of one of the managers Shang had been under in his career as a fighter back on Earth.\n\"Go in,\" Soran said, gesturing to the door with his head.\nShang looked at the door with a frown.\nHe had no idea why someone like the dean wanted to meet him, but it was suspicious.\nHowever, even if the dean had some ulterior motives, there was nothing Shang could do. No one but the three of them was currently around, and if they wanted to do something to him, they wouldn't need to put on such an act.\nSo eventually, Shang took a deep breath and opened one of the two doors as he stepped into the room.\nWhen Shang saw the room, the first word that came to his mind was simple. There was only a table and a chair in the room. A black spear stood at the corner of the room, but it obviously didn't belong here.\nThat was it.\nIt looked almost like an interrogation room.\nWas this truly the dean's office?\nShang could also get a clear look at the dean for the first time, and the first word that came to his mind when seeing the dean was general.\nThe dean looked exactly like one would imagine a general in a medieval movie to look like.\nHe wore a fitting black suit of armor. There were no great designs or anything on the suit of armor, but it gave off a feeling of experience, time, and status.\nAs for the dean himself, he was a middle-aged man. He had long black hair that went past his shoulders, and he had one of these beards that circled his mouth. Shang didn't know how they were called.\nThe dean currently had a stack of papers in front of him, and Shang noticed that these were the papers Soran had prepared while interviewing Shang.\n\"Please close the door,\" the dean said without looking up from the papers.\nShang noticed that he was still keeping the door open, and he quickly closed it.\nAfter Shang closed the door, some kind of small statue appeared in the dean's right hand. The dean put the statue onto a circled part of his table, and the circle around that part suddenly began shining in a white light.\nWhen that happened, Shang felt that the density of Mana was decreasing inside the room.\nJust like Duke Whirlwind, the dean was absorbing a ton of Mana from his surroundings. However, there was no new Mana entering the room.\n\"That is an Isolation Magic Circle,\" the dean commented. \"It serves as protection against Scouting, Scrying, and Inquisition Magic. As long as a High Mage isn't directly trying to listen in on us from beyond the door, no one is going to hear anything we will be discussing in here.\"\n\"Please, sit down,\" the dean said, lightly gesturing to an empty spot in front of the table.\nSHING!\nA chair appeared at that spot.\nShang was still uncertain, but he followed the dean's instructions and sat down.\nAfter some seconds, the dean put the papers to the side and looked at Shang with his azure eyes.\nFor some reason, Shang felt that the dean's gaze held a deep meaning. It was almost like the dean knew something important about Shang.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ After looking at Shang for a bit, the dean's eyes wandered toward Shang's sword.\nWhen the dean's gaze went towards Shang's sword, Shang felt his sword shake for some reason, which made him more nervous.\nUp to now, the sword had only shaken if there was danger present.\n\"Put your sword on the table,\" the dean said.\nShang's frown intensified.\nHad the dean noticed that his sword wasn't as simple as it appeared?\nNevertheless, Shang complied. There was nothing he could do anyway.\nShang took out his sword and placed it on the table.\nThe sword began to shake more and more, and for some reason, Shang felt like he had betrayed his sword. Up to now, it had only shaken when there was danger, and judging by the intensity of the shaking, the sword probably sensed life-threatening danger right now.\n\"You seem surprised,\" the dean commented.\nShang threw a look at the dean, but he didn't answer.\n\"It seems like there are a lot of things you don't know,\" the dean said. Then, he gestured towards the shaking sword with his head. \"Watch.\"\nShang wasn't sure what the dean meant, but he looked at his sword.\nCrk. Crk.\nThe shaking became more rhythmic, and the sword moved a slight bit to the side.\nCrk. Crk.\nThe sword moved faster and faster, but it still moved relatively slowly.\nShang looked with surprise at his sword. It was moving in one specific direction, and that direction wasn't him. It also wasn't the dean.\nShang looked at the spear in the corner of the room.\nWhy was his sword trying to get to the spear in the corner?\nWhen Shang looked back at his sword, he noticed that it was about to fall from the table.\nBut then, something in Shang's peripheral vision moved. Shang looked over, and his eyes widened.\nThe spear was hovering!\nThe spear slowly flew to the sword, and the shaking of the sword intensified as the spear approached it.\nClack!\nThen, the sword leaped forward and touched the spear, and as soon as it did, it was like they became inseparable. It was like they were magnetized to each other.\nThe spear floated back to the corner of the room with the sword and landed again.\n\"What's happening?\" Shang asked.\n\"Teaching,\" the dean said as he looked at the two weapons with a melancholic expression. \"I still remember when I was in your position. I had just been here for maybe a year.\"\nShang felt like the dean wasn't referring to this Zone or this country.\n\"Time passes so fast,\" the dean said with a sigh. \"Seems like I've fulfilled my purpose in his eyes.\"\nFor a second, Shang became confused, but his eyes widened when his mind connected the dots.\n\"So, you're the new one, huh?\" the dean asked as he looked at Shang.\n\"Anything interesting happen lately on Earth?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 77 Purpose\nShang almost couldn't wrap his mind around the words he had just heard.\nWas the dean also someone from Earth?\nShang had thought that he was the only one!\n\"Surprised?\" the dean asked as he looked at Shang with an even expression.\nHowever, Shang's expression only changed into confusion.\n\"What are you talking about?\" Shang asked.\nWhen Shang said that, the atmosphere in the room took a monumental turn. It was like the temperature had dropped by several degrees.\n\"I don't have time for these games,\" the dean directly said. \"Gleipnir is only teaching your sword because I allowed it to. I can also order it to consume your sword.\"\nShang took a deep breath as he looked over. The spear hadn't changed, but it felt far more dangerous now.\n\"How can I believe you?\" Shang asked with an aggressive tone to mask his fear. \"What if this isn't an illusion, and you are trying to get me to divulge information?\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The dean's eyes narrowed. \"And what if that were the case?\" he asked with annoyance. \"You've seen my secret, and you would die regardless. Might as well tell me more about that God you encountered so that I can more easily seek my death by knowing too much.\"\n\"Additionally, do you actually believe that someone on my level can glean such high-level information from your mind? Do you honestly believe the God didn't put up any defenses?\"\nShang didn't like hearing that his life was not under his own control, but he had to admit that the dean was right.\nEventually, Shang took a deep breath as he looked into the dean's eyes.\n\"You don't seem like someone from Earth,\" he said.\n\"Neither do you,\" the dean answered coldly. \"You have the eyes of someone that has killed innocent people.\"\nShang's mind immediately went back to that fateful night, but he only looked back at the dean. \"I had my reasons.\"\n\"Your reasons don't matter,\" the dean said with a direct voice.\nWhen Shang heard that, he grew angry. As if the dean hadn't done things he regretted. Shang was certain that it was nearly impossible to reach such a level of power without killing a human or two.\nHowever, the dean's following words were different from what Shang had expected.\n\"On the path to power, we kill people,\" the dean continued. \"It doesn't matter what they have done. As long as it helps us to become more powerful, that's reason enough.\"\nFor a bit, Shang's eyes widened, but then they narrowed. \"Quite interesting to hear that from someone from Earth,\" he said.\n\"When an extreme switches, it can often switch to the opposite extreme,\" the dean said coldly. \"Yes, this kind of attitude is something only psychopaths and serious criminals have on Earth, but you should already know in what kind of world we are.\"\n\"Individual power reigns supreme. The common people have no say in how the leaders run things. On Earth, the leaders had to be careful of a revolution, but in this world, a revolution doesn't matter.\"\n\"As long as I'm not included, Duke Whirlwind could defend himself against the united forces of his entire Duchy. He would rain devastating spells down from the sky and leave towards a safe location when he runs out of Mana. On top of that, beasts in the True Path Stage wouldn't have anyone stopping them anymore, and the casualties would pile up into mountains.\"\n\"I can see that you haven't been in this world for very long,\" the dean said. \"You haven't seen what kind of atrocities are considered normal here.\"\nShang only looked at the dean with an unfriendly expression.\nOriginally, Shang had expected that he would be able to find a friend in the dean. After all, they had something that intrinsically connected them.\nYet, the dean felt way too direct and brutal for Shang. According to what the dean had said, he would be fine with killing everyone as long as their death would benefit his power.\nShang wasn't like that.\nHe wasn't afraid of killing his enemies, but he also didn't want to kill just anyone.\n\"You don't seem like your two disciples,\" Shang commented.\n\"They are them. I am me,\" the dean said. \"But that has nothing to do with you. I didn't call you here to answer your questions.\"\n\"Why did you call me here?\" Shang asked with a neutral voice.\n\"I'm here to tell you your purpose,\" he said.\n\"And that is?\" Shang asked with skepticism.\n\"In order to make you understand, I have to tell you about my predecessor,\" the dean said. \"My predecessor managed to reach the Peak of the Commander Stage, but he wasn't able to reach the True Path Stage, no matter how hard he tried.\"\n\"For many years, he attempted to find a way to break through the shackles that have bound the warrior's path for thousands of years, and in the end, he managed to find a way.\"\n\"However, he had only theorized that path. His background from Earth gave him a great ability to find a solution to very complex problems, but his training and his kind of training have ruined his prospects. It became impossible for him to advance.\"\n\"That was when I turned up,\" the dean said. \"We two met, and my predecessor put his ambitions on my shoulders. He would teach me everything about how to reach the Fourth Realm, and I would put his theories on how to reach it into practice.\"\n\"Eventually, I succeeded. It was like I was a perfect test subject for his theories,\" the dean explained.\nThen, the dean looked at Shang. \"Now, onto you.\"\nShang didn't react.\n\"Just like my predecessor, I managed to theorize something. However, it is impossible for me to test it on myself, and it's difficult to make this method more accessible to everyone without a successful example.\"\n\"And then, just when I was about to throw away decades of my work because all the previous procedures have failed, I get this stack of papers,\" the dean said as he waved around the papers Soran had written.\nThe dean put them in front of him and went through them.\n\"Memory loss.\"\n\"Has only been in the wilderness.\"\n\"Warrior's body.\"\n\"Outstanding reflexes.\"\n\"Young.\"\n\"And most importantly,\" the dean said as his index finger pointed to one specific sentence on one of the pages.\n\"Extremely high pain threshold.\"\nThe dean put the papers back together again. \"In short, you are perfect for my procedure. You are nearly as perfect as it could get.\"\n\"And you think the God sent me because of this procedure of yours?\" Shang asked.\n\"Yes,\" the dean answered. \"By now, I'm quite confident in the God's goals. His end goal is obviously the resurrection of the warrior's path, but you can't achieve such a goal in a single go from our current standpoint. You need smaller goals along the way.\"\n\"My predecessor's purpose was to theorize the Fourth Realm.\"\n\"My purpose is to reach the Fourth Realm and theorize a method to move warriors to the same level of relative power as the Mages.\"\n\"And your purpose is to put this method into practice and probably to theorize a way to reach the Fifth Realm.\"\n\"That's what you're here for.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 78 Trust?\nShang didn't know what he should think about the dean's words, but for now, the dean's words made a lot of sense.\n\"And what do you mean with reaching the same level of power as the Mages?\" Shang asked.\n\"Basis of power per Realm,\" the dean answered. \"Do you know what a Mana Source is?\"\n\"Yes,\" Shang said. \"When I met Duke Whirlwind, he told me about them.\"\nThe dean nodded.\n\"Then tell me, why would Apprentices need something above their own level to reach said level? Are they unable to reach it themselves?\" the dean asked.\nShang frowned. \"Probably not. It's probably possible to also become an Adept without one.\"\n\"Correct, it is possible,\" the dean said. \"However, if an Apprentice doesn't absorb a Mana Source, they will reach the Adept Realm without having an intrinsic connection to their Affinity. This makes casting spells harder, take longer, and waste more Mana.\"\n\"With a lot of practice, said Adept can overcome these limitations, but that will take at least three additional decades, and that's assuming that the Adept with the Mana Source doesn't practice at all. As long as the Adept with the Mana Source actually trains their abilities, the gap will only widen.\"\n\"As you know, the Mages are supreme in this world. Us warriors don't even count as second-class citizens in their eyes. Why?\"\n\"Because any random Adept can beat over 90% of the warriors at their same level. A matchup between an Adept and a warrior in the General Stage will end with the Adept winning 19 out of 20 times. Only the most elite warriors can take on an average Mage.\"\nWhen Shang heard that, he took a deep breath.\nThat was a terrifying statistic. Sure enough, the Mages reigned supreme.\n\"Even worse, the gap only widens in the Third Realm. In general, it needs a team of at least three elite warriors in the Commander Stage to kill an average Mage.\"\n\"This gigantic gap exists mainly due to the Mana Sources. Without the Mana Sources, we warriors could take on the Mages on an almost even playing field,\" the dean explained.\n\"And you're trying to create something similar for warriors, I assume?\" Shang commented.\nThe dean nodded.\n\"Bloodline Injection,\" the dean said.\n\"Bloodline Injection?\" Shang asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Like a blood transfusion?\"\n\"Similar but not entirely the same,\" the dean explained. \"We don't only replace the blood but also the marrow.\"\nShang took a deep breath when he heard that.\n\"The marrow?\" he asked, his voice shaking a bit.\nThe dean nodded again, and he looked at Shang. \"Your resistance to pain is the most important aspect.\"\nShang felt a hole open up in his chest.\nReplacing someone's marrow.\nSuch a procedure would go beyond painful, and Shang guessed that, since the resistance to pain was so important, they couldn't do it under anesthesia.\n\"What do you get out of this?\" Shang asked. \"Not only does such a procedure have a very low chance of success, even if it has succeeded before, but I also don't understand what's in it for you.\"\n\"You did say that everything is fine as long as it increases your own power, right?\"\nThe dean looked at Shang neutrally.\n\"Pride, knowledge, and revenge,\" the dean said.\n\"Pride, because I can say that I managed to elevate the world of warriors. I'm just a human, and just like every other human, I want my name to never be forgotten.\"\n\"Knowledge, because understanding more about the body of a warrior might allow me to further increase my strength.\"\n\"Revenge,\" the dean's eyes became cold, \"I want the Mages to be thrown off their thrones.\"\nShang raised an eyebrow. \"You had problems with Mages?\"\n\"That's none of your concern,\" the dean said coldly. \"What's of your concern is your compliance.\"\n\"You do want to become more powerful, right?\" the dean commented. \"The God wouldn't have sent me someone without any lust for power.\"\nShang looked with an evaluating expression at the dean. \"I'm obviously interested. However, I don't trust you.\"\n\"You don't have to trust me,\" the dean answered directly. \"If I wanted to kill you, I would have already killed you. Additionally, your survival is paramount to my plans. If you can't survive, my theorized method hasn't been proven yet.\"\n\"I'm not helping you. I'm helping myself, and you are simply an additional beneficiary of my help.\"\nShang definitely didn't like how the dean talked to him.\nHowever, for some reason, Shang felt something he hadn't expected he would feel.\nRespect.\nShang had no goodwill towards the dean, but he respected him.\nWhy?\nBecause, as far as Shang could tell, the dean wasn't someone that lied. Additionally, he hadn't even been vague with his answers.\nHe had been very direct, and instead of sneakily evading some questions, he had either fully answered them or directly told Shang that it was none of his business.\nThis was something Shang could respect.\nHowever, for some reason, Shang still couldn't stand the dean. Shang wasn't certain why.\nHe just didn't like him.\nClank.\nShang heard something and looked at the table.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ His sword had returned. The silent sound had been the sword touching the table a bit while slowly flying towards Shang.\nShang put forward his hand and touched the sword.\nThen, his eyes widened.\nShang could feel feelings coming off the sword!\n\"Our weapons have Spirits in them,\" the dean said. \"The more powerful they become, the smarter they become. I would suggest that you find any Rank Two metal to strengthen your sword. Having an intelligent weapon will help you in your training.\"\nShang only barely heard the dean since he was preoccupied with his weapon.\nWhat was his sword feeling?\nCuriosity.\nCloseness.\nIt was like the sword had met Shang for the first time, but for some reason, it felt very close to him.\nIt was like a child looking at its parents for the first time.\n\"When will you be ready for the procedure?\" the dean asked, pulling Shang out of his thoughts.\nShang looked over, and his brows furrowed.\n\"Getting cold feet?\" the dean asked emotionlessly.\n\"No, it's not that,\" Shang said.\n\"Then what? I don't have all day,\" the dean nearly growled.\nShang wasn't certain if he should tell the dean his thoughts, but in the end, he decided that he would go all in.\n\"I want an Affinity,\" Shang said.\nThe dean raised an eyebrow.\n\"I saw your disciple, and I believe that the path of a Magic Warrior is more fitting for me. However, the God hasn't given me an Affinity.\"\n\"So, is there a way to get an Affinity?\" Shang asked.\n\"No,\" the dean answered directly. \"Affinities are based on the soul of a person. If you wanted an Affinity, you would need to switch souls with someone that has one, and switching souls literally means switching bodies. In short, you would enter the body of the other person, but you would still not have an affinity.\"\nShang released a sigh.\nWhen the dean saw that, a cold gleam shone in his eyes. \"You lied,\" he commented with a cold voice.\n\"I had to,\" Shang said. \"As I've said, I don't trust you. Because of that, I wanted to make sure that my Affinity couldn't benefit your power.\"\nFor a while, the dean only looked at Shang.\nThen, he snorted.\n\"Smart,\" he commented. \"Alright, so what is this Affinity about?\"\nShang took another deep breath, and then, he decided to tell the dean everything he knew about his Affinity.\nHe even told the dean about the Pure Mana Source he had absorbed.\nWhen the dean heard the details, he scratched his chin.\n\"It's definitely not an Ice Affinity,\" he said. \"Additionally, you said that the God told you that it's a special Affinity. With his capabilities, it could be a unique one that doesn't even exist in nature.\"\nThe dean looked at Shang. \"However, he wouldn't give you something useless. I guess that there is a way for you to unlock this Affinity by mixing different Mana Sources. If you want to take advantage of your Affinity, you maybe need to absorb another Mana Source to create a perfect mix.\"\n\"Let's try that out.\"\nSHING!\nShang's eyes widened in shock.\nWhat!?\nThe dean was so rich!?\nJust now, the dean had taken out eight Pure Mana Sources with different affinities!\n\"You can keep whatever you can absorb, but I want to be paid back in the future,\" the dean said.\nShang looked at the Mana Sources.\nThen, he looked at the dean.\n\"Deal!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 79 Temperature\nShang looked at all the different Mana Sources with shining eyes.\nElemental Mana began to fill the room, but the Magic Circle kept the Mana isolated, making the different kinds interact with each other. There wasn't much Mana in the surroundings, but the different forms of Mana still created some minor phenomena.\nThe temperature in the room fluctuated wildly. Some bolts of lightning appeared and disappeared in the surroundings.\nLots of tiny things appeared.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang also noticed something very interesting very quickly.\nThe dean hadn't summoned a Mana Source for Ice Mana, but there were still eight different Mana Sources.\nYet, according to what Shang knew, there were only seven affinities.\nSo, why were there suddenly nine, including Ice?\nShang quickly checked each Mana Source.\nOrange ethereal spire that released a ton of heat? Got to be fire.\nBrown ethereal spire that summoned rock around it? Shang knew that one already. That was earth.\nGreen ethereal spire that created tons of wind? Probably wind.\nDeep blue ethereal spire that summoned water in the air, which rained down around it? Water.\nSilver ethereal spire that summoned bolts of lightning? Lightning.\nGrey ethereal spire that seemed to vibrate in the air? Shang wasn't that certain about what it was, but based on what he had already seen and what was missing, Shang was rather certain that this was metal.\nThat left the last two.\nOne ethereal spire looked like a black tear in space. It completely absorbed all forms of light and let no light escape.\nShang remembered that he had once believed the Pest Cats to have a Darkness Affinity, but he hadn't heard of any form of Darkness Affinity from other humans.\nWas this darkness?\nThat would also explain the last Mana Source.\nThe last ethereal spire lit up the entire room, and if the darkness Mana Source weren't here, Shang would have needed to protect his eyes.\nThis was probably a Mana Source for light.\n\"I didn't know darkness and light also existed as Affinities,\" Shang commented.\n\"They're very rare,\" the dean said. \"There are some beasts that have these affinities, but they are truly rare amongst humans. Most of the world thinks that darkness and light affinities can't exist inside humanity, but they do.\"\n\"Some true Mages know of the existence of a couple of humans with these affinities, but only High Mages get to meet them occasionally. Their existence is mostly being kept a secret to surprise a potential enemy.\"\n\"In comparison to the other Affinities, studies on the Darkness and Light Affinities are not made public and not conducted in the public. That means that a human unfortunate enough to receive such an affinity won't be able to become a powerful Mage without selling themselves to a big power.\"\nShang scratched his chin. \"Why is it like this?\" he asked.\n\"Variation,\" the dean answered. \"Every power knows what sort of abilities all the Mages with all the Affinities have. However, they also know that the enemy might have some Mages with the Light or Darkness Affinity.\"\n\"Now, do you protect your attacking force with a Magic Circle that costs only ten gold that can deal with the known Affinities, or will you spend 10,000 gold for one that can also deal with light and darkness? Of course, the prices I just mentioned are only an example and don't reflect the real prices.\"\n\"Additionally, the enemy might have spells that could turn the entire situation around as long as you decide to do a certain thing. However, you don't know what that certain thing is since you don't know the ability.\"\n\"It could be something like gathering several Mages to Synchrocast a huge fireball. The enemy wouldn't know that they shouldn't do that, which is why they are doing it. So then, you use your Light Mage to suppress the light of the fireball and the Mana it gives off, confusing the surrounding Mages about its power and making it explode in the middle of them.\"\nShang listened with rapt attention and absorbed all the knowledge.\n\"What kind of Affinity do I have?\" Shang asked as he scratched his chin.\n\"None of the ones before you,\" the dean answered. \"Those only represent the pure Affinities. There are also Mixed Affinities, but they are very rare. A good example would be the Empress Cobra. It lives in a swamp filled with nothing but poison, and it rules over all the poisons in the world.\"\n\"According to some advanced studies, the Poison Affinity is comprised of the Water Affinity and the Darkness Affinity. However, as far as I know, the existence of a human with a Poison Affinity is only theoretical.\"\n\"If the God said that your Affinity is very special, it could theoretically be everything. It might even be something never seen before. It might even be something so confusing that we don't even know what it is.\"\n\"Try it,\" the dean said. \"I would be lying if I said that this didn't interest me.\"\nShang nodded and walked over to the closest one, earth.\nOf course, Shang already knew that he didn't have an Earth Affinity, but he wanted to feel how it interacted with him again.\nShang touched the brown spire, and it quickly entered his body. After a couple of seconds of circling around in his body, it left through Shang's mouth again, just like that last time.\nSHING!\nThe Earth Mana Source vanished as the dean pulled it back into his Space Ring.\nThen, Shang went to the next Mana Source, wind.\nShang absorbed this Mana Source as well, and just like earth, it left Shang's body after some seconds.\nShang's Affinity wasn't related to wind.\nThe next one was water, and just like the previous two, it simply left Shang's body.\nThen, Shang looked at the next one, fire.\nShang already suspected that his Affinity might involve fire. After all, his left arm was also heating up while using his ability.\nShang touched the Fire Mana Source, and it entered his body.\nIt tried to get to Shang's head, but after realizing that it couldn't get there, it went to Shang's left arm. When that happened, Shang became quite nervous. He hoped that his left arm wouldn't explode due to the opposing forces.\nHowever, nothing like that happened. When the Fire Mana Source entered Shang's left arm, it simply began to eat the Ice Mana Source.\nOf course, the Ice Mana Source fought back, and the two of them began to enter a fight for supremacy. After several seconds, they entered a stabilized state.\nShang felt like the two Mana Sources were rotating counter-clockwise. The image reminded Shang of that ouroboros picture on earth, the one with the two snakes eating each other forever.\n\"Fire and Ice,\" the dean said from the side. \"Opposing forces, but their fusion makes sense.\"\nShang looked at the dean.\n\"What you described sounded like an Affinity for Temperature. However, I didn't suspect it to be an Affinity for Temperature since that felt far too boring for something that the God would call very special,\" the dean said.\n\"Try it out. You can't damage this room.\"\nShang looked with interest at his left arm.\nThen, he pointed it towards the wall.\nSSHH!\nA hot wind left Shang's left arm, and Shang felt like he had just opened a pre-heated oven.\nAt the same time, Shang's left arm became very cold, and he nearly lost all feeling in it.\nWhen Shang felt the power of his attack, he could only frown.\n\"How underwhelming.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 80 Not Temperature\nWhy was it underwhelming?\nWell, just as said previously, it was like opening a preheated oven. A preheated oven often had 200°C hot air coming out of it, double the temperature of boiling water.\nIn a way, this was insanely hot.\nHowever, the only thing a human did when confronted with such a blast was to feel discomfort and maybe protect their face.\nThat was it.\nAnd in return, Shang's arm nearly got frozen.\nIn short, this ability was supremely useless. It would only be useful as a way to cool Shang's arm after unleashing the Ice Mana from his arm, and maybe also to use it as a way to move around with the backdraft.\n'Well, now that I think about it. It's actually not as useless as I've thought. I can use my ability more, and being able to move around in the air can give me far more flexibility. There's certainly something I can do with this,' Shang thought.\nShang pointed towards the wall again to heat his arm to a comfortable temperature, but two things happened that he hadn't expected.\nFirst of all, Shang's arm suddenly felt like it had been thrown into fire, even though Shang had only heated it to a comfortable 20°C.\nThe second thing was that quite a strong wind had appeared in the room.\nWhen Shang saw that, his eyebrows furrowed. 'I can create wind by unleashing cold and hot air. However, my left arm gets damaged during the process. Cooling something hot down in an instant isn't so bad since it's simply hardening something flexible.'\n'However, heating something cold will result in tissue being torn at certain places. I mean, my arm is still usable, but it definitely isn't comfortable. Additionally, the temperature hasn't fluctuated as much.'\nShang looked at his left arm.\n'If I unleash a powerful gust of hot air to shoot myself at an opponent with the draft, I could cool my arm to a terrifyingly low temperature, which allows me to unleash a horrifyingly cold explosion of cold wind.'\nShang narrowed his eyes.\n'However, such an action will most likely tear my entire arm apart. It might even explode into a bloody shower. At that point, my left arm would be useless.'\n\"You don't seem to realize the true potential of your Affinity,\" the dean suddenly said.\nShang looked over at the dean with furrowed brows. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"Do you have problems with coming into contact with light?\" the dean asked.\nShang wasn't certain why the dean asked such a question. \"No?\" he asked skeptically.\n\"What about a laser?\"\nFor a second, Shang wasn't certain what the dean meant, but his eyes widened when he made the connection.\nConcentration!\n\"Can I do that?\" he asked absentmindedly as his mind fell into thought.\n\"It should be possible,\" the dean said. \"The amount of Ice and Fire Mana you can release is a lot, but it's spread over a huge area. If you can spread it over a smaller area, you can intensify the effect.\"\n\"Additionally, the power of the Temperature Affinity only unveils its true strength later down the line.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Shang asked.\nThe dean pointed at Shang's arm. \"Your body,\" he said. \"The more powerful your body, the heavier it gets. The heavier your left arm, the more power is needed to cool or heat it. The more power is needed to cool or heat it, the more power you can unleash with your ability.\"\nShang's eyes widened as several images shot through his head.\nShang imagined himself pointing his arm backward, unleashing a powerful wind of cold air.\nThen, Shang arrived in front of his opponent with a steaming arm and pointed at their head.\nBANG!\nA concentrated laser was unleashed, burning a hole through their skull.\nNow, Shang could definitely see the potential of his Affinity.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang looked at his left arm with shining eyes. 'My Affinity is not that useless after all.'\n\"If you're done dreaming, try the remaining Mana Sources,\" the dean said.\nShang looked at the dean with confusion. \"Why?\"\n\"As I've said previously, I doubt that the God gave you something as simple as a Temperature Affinity. Temperature is probably only a component or a base concept of your Affinity,\" the dean explained.\nShang's brows furrowed again, but he still decided to go through with it.\nThe first ethereal spire Shang touched was the one for lightning, and after a couple of seconds, it also left his body.\nLightning wasn't the way to go.\nThen, Shang touched the Mana Source for metal. Shang felt a bit uncomfortable when touching the Mana Source. For some reason, the Mana Source for metal felt very dangerous to Shang.\nHowever, Shang had worried for nothing. The Mana Source exited Shang's body just like the previous one.\nShang went to the next Mana Source, the one for light.\nSuddenly, Shang's eyes widened.\nWhat was going on!?\nShang felt the Mana Source for light enter his left arm and remain there.\n'What? Why?!' Shang thought to himself in confusion.\nAll of Shang's previous dreams were thrown out of the window after this development.\nLight?\nShang couldn't imagine how light could be related to temperature.\nDid it have something to do with a star, maybe? After all, the sun was hot and bright, right?\nBut then what did that have to do with ice and cold?!\nAfter the Mana Source for light entered Shang's left arm, it simply shone on the other two Mana Sources.\nHowever, something very surprising was that the other two Mana Sources reacted the same way. Shang had expected the light to strengthen fire since the two of them were related, but it didn't only strengthen the fire but also the ice.\nAs Shang looked at his left arm in shock, the dean looked at Shang with narrowed eyes.\nIt was just as he expected. Shang's Affinity wasn't as simple as just an Affinity for temperatures.\n\"Try the darkness one,\" the dean said. \"I have a feeling that you can also absorb that one.\"\nShang looked over, and he looked at the Mana Source for darkness.\nThen, he touched it.\nAnd sure enough, it got absorbed.",

      "content": "Chapter 81 Balance?\nWhen the Mana Source for darkness entered Shang's left arm, it began to clash with the light. The two of them began to fight, just like the fire and ice were fighting.\nHowever, the darkness and light began to rotate clockwise, the opposite of the other two.\nIn the end, Shang had fire and ice rotating counter-clockwise and light and darkness rotating around them in the opposite direction.\nIt looked like some form of weird whirlpool.\n\"What can you do now?\" the dean asked.\nShang looked at his left arm with confusion.\nYes, what could he do now?\nShang lifted his left arm and pointed it at the wall. Then, he willed the light to become active.\nAs he willed it, a shining beam of light came out of Shang's arm, forcing him to protect his eyes.\nHowever, nothing else had happened.\n'Do I have the ability of a flashlight now?' Shang thought, but before he could think more, he got distracted by a feeling of pain coming from his left arm.\nShang looked over, and his eyes widened in horror.\nWas this still his arm?!\nWhat did his arm look like?\nOld.\nDecrepit.\nUnhealthy.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Injured.\nIt was like Shang's left arm was the left arm of an old man on his deathbed.\nAs Shang looked at his left arm, he felt a feeling of disconnect. This didn't look like his arm at all!\nHowever, Shang still managed to make the logical connection as to what the beam of light had actually accomplished.\nIf his arm was old, decrepit, and weak, the beam of light should have done the opposite.\n'So, logically, that beam of light is supposed to heal others?' Shang thought with confusion. 'I don't think it would work on me since it also injures me to an equal degree. At best, I could probably transfer my injuries from all over my body to my left arm, but that isn't very useful.'\nShang looked forward. 'The beam of light has taken the vitality of my left arm and unleashed it into the surroundings.'\n'So, if I use darkness…'\nShang pointed forward and willed darkness to be unleashed.\nSSHHH!\nSome wind appeared in front of Shang and got absorbed into his arm. However, the wind wasn't very powerful, and Shang didn't see his arm healing at all.\n'Since I didn't absorb any vitality, my arm didn't get healed, which makes sense. I can unleash my vitality at basically anything, but it doesn't always have an effect. However, I can't absorb vitality from stuff that doesn't have vitality,' Shang thought.\nThen, Shang looked at the dean.\nThe dean knew what Shang wanted and lifted his arm. \"Don't overdo it. If you absorb too much, you might explode.\"\nShang nodded and willed for his arm to unleash darkness.\nHowever, nothing had happened, which made Shang frown. 'I can unleash all my other abilities from range, but darkness apparently needs me to touch the other person.'\nShang walked over to the dean and grabbed his wrist. Then, Shang willed darkness to take effect.\nIn an instant, Shang's left arm felt like it was about to explode, and Shang quickly stopped.\nAfter looking over, Shang noticed that his left arm was extremely muscular and almost swollen.\nWhen Shang saw that, cold sweat ran down his back. 'I nearly absorbed too much!' he thought with fear.\nShang quickly pointed to the dean and unleashed some healing light to reduce the vitality in his left arm, making it normal again.\nLuckily, his arm was no longer injured.\n'So, if I absorb too much vitality, as long as it's not enough to make my arm explode, my arm can be fully healed,' Shang thought as he scratched his chin.\n'That gives me a way to reset my other abilities. I could use some heat to cool my arm down, use a lot of cold to injure my enemy and injure my left arm, and then just absorb their vitality to regain my ability to do the same thing again.'\n'Theoretically, it's an infinitely repeatable cycle. In a way, I'm using my enemy's power against them. I absorb their power, use it to injure them, and then absorb more of their power.'\n\"I think I know what your Affinity is,\" the dean suddenly said.\nWhen Shang heard that, his thoughts got pulled back to the present.\nRight, what was his Affinity, actually?\nAn Affinity for the sun would make sense with fire and light, but it wouldn't make sense with darkness and ice.\nAn Affinity for Temperature would make sense with fire and ice, but it didn't make sense with light and darkness.\nAn Affinity for Twilight would make sense with light and darkness, but it wouldn't make sense with fire and ice.\nWhat about some kind of Affinity involving the universe? There were ice planets and stars. One would be darkness and ice, and the other would be fire and light.\nHowever, that also wouldn't make any sense. After all, if this were some form of cosmic Affinity, it would need to include normal planets as well, and Shang had no Affinity with Earth.\nThen, what was it?\nThe dean saw Shang's expression. \"An Affinity doesn't always have to be something that actually exists. It can also be a concept.\"\n\"A concept?\" Shang asked.\nThe dean nodded. \"Let's take temperature, for example. Temperature doesn't really exist as its own thing. It is simply a state of matter. A higher temperature means that the piece of matter has more energy. A low temperature means that it doesn't have much energy.\"\n\"So, in a way, temperature doesn't really exist.\"\n\"Something else is poison. Yes, it is something that exists, but different kinds of poison are poisonous to different beings. Something that we see as poisonous might not be poisonous to some plants or animals. So, in their world, the poison isn't poison, but food or water.\"\nShang nodded. The dean knew many things, and Shang valued the opportunity to learn from him.\nShang still didn't like the dean for some reason, but he still respected him.\n\"I think you have an Affinity for Balance,\" the dean said.\n\"Balance?\" Shang asked as he looked at his left arm with furrowed brows.\n'High temperatures and low temperatures are in opposition, and they could be balanced. Light is also basically raw energy while darkness is the absence of energy.'\n'So, I can essentially tweak the amount of energy?' Shang thought.\n\"Why Balance?\" Shang asked. \"It feels more like a form of energy manipulation.\"\n\"If it were a form of pure energy manipulation, you would have also had an Affinity for Wind. After all, wind is just movement, and movement also represents energy. Yet, you don't have an Affinity for it,\" the dean said.\nShang frowned when he heard that.\nBalance?\nWas it truly just that?\nSure, Balance was a rather abstract concept when compared to other Affinities, but it still felt incomplete to him for some reason.\n\"It somehow still feels incomplete,\" Shang said with uncertainty.\nThe dean furrowed his brows and looked at Shang's left arm.\n\"How do you perceive the Mana Sources in your left arm?\" he asked.\n\"Fire and Ice are fighting each other in a counter-clockwise rotation. Light and darkness are fighting each other around the other two in a clockwise rotation,\" Shang said.\nThe dean nodded. \"Is there something additional or different somewhere in the center?\"\nShang concentrated and focused on his left arm.\nHowever, he didn't feel anything that shouldn't be there.\n\"No, it's only these four things,\" he said.\nThe dean frowned. \"Then, that means that your Affinity hasn't truly unveiled itself yet. If the Mana Sources are still separate, it means there is still a missing component.\"\n\"However, I have already given you one of all the possible Mana Sources in existence. There are no more Affinities.\"\nWhen Shang heard the dean's words, he got reminded of something else he wanted to discuss.\nIt might be related to the issue with his Affinity.",

      "content": "Chapter 82 Second Gift\n\"That reminds me of something else I wanted to say,\" Shang said.\n\"What is it?\" the dean asked with a neutral voice.\n\"You asked when I wanted to undergo the procedure, right?\" Shang asked.\nThe dean nodded.\n\"Is it already fully developed?\" he asked.\nThe dean nodded again.\n\"So, you wouldn't need any additional time to ready the procedure, right?\" Shang asked.\n\"A day at most, maybe. It depends on what beast I choose,\" he said with annoyance. \"Why are you asking such a pointless question?\"\nShang nodded. \"Then, it's not that,\" he said. \"It's like this. My first of my available questions for the God has been about what I should do when I arrive here.\"\nThe dean's eyes shone a bit.\nNone of them had brought up the questions yet. After all, these questions could be valuable intel, and it was impossible to verify the information. Both of them could just lie.\n\"And he said what?\" the dean asked. Obviously, Shang wanted to share the answer.\n\"He said that I should remain in the wilderness for two years before joining society again,\" Shang said.\nThe dean nodded. \"That's the best course of action for you, and you will learn why when you join your class. This is especially important for you.\"\n\"Especially important for me? Why?\" Shang asked.\n\"You have received your answers, and you have received your weapon. However, you have not yet come into contact with your second gift. I presume the God has given you the same thing as me,\" the dean said.\n\"What is the second gift?\" Shang asked.\n\"It has two uses. The first use is storage. It's basically a superior Space Ring without the limitations,\" the dean explained. \"The other use is inheritance.\"\n\"Inheritance? In what sense?\" Shang asked.\n\"As you have heard, the golden age of the warriors is so far in the past that no one even knows that it has existed in the first place. No ruins from that era have survived until this day, as far as I am aware.\"\n\"This means that it is impossible to gain more advanced knowledge for the path of a warrior than I have access to unless you manage to create it yourself. So, for all intents and purposes, I essentially count as the strongest warrior that has ever existed.\"\n\"If it were back then, I would have probably only counted as a child or trash, but there is no evidence left from that time, and it essentially doesn't exist anymore. The Mages also don't have any evidence from that time, as far as I know.\"\n\"That's why the God gave you a way to inherit knowledge from the long-forgotten era,\" the dean explained. \"However, as you might have guessed, the God doesn't like being bored.\"\n\"Because of that, he made the inheritance a contest. You will fight more and more powerful enemies on your level until you eventually die. After that, you will be resurrected, and you will receive an inheritance based on how well you did.\"\nShang frowned when he heard that. Yes, that sounded exactly like something the God would do.\n\"The inheritance you get is the most important thing contributing to your future success. If you manage to get a good one when you reach the General Stage, your Battle-Strength will be even more powerful for the next test in the Commander Stage. That allows you to get a better score and get an even better inheritance.\"\n\"Battle-Strength?\" Shang asked.\n\"It's how powerful you are compared to others at the same level,\" the dean added before continuing with his explanation.\n\"In essence, the cycle can't be broken. If it does, you will lose all your momentum.\"\n\"Who knows, if you do well enough, you might actually go all the way. After all, an amazing inheritance probably even shows you the way to the next Realm.\"\nThe dean took a deep breath, but his expression didn't change. \"In a way, I envy you. You will receive the power of my procedure, which will allow you to get better inheritances. You will have an advantage I've never had.\"\nShang wasn't sure how he should react right now.\nSo, he decided not to react at all and simply continued the conversation.\n\"Thank you for your teachings,\" Shang said to quickly finish the topic. \"However, this is not what I was referring to.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"What were you referring to?\" the dean asked with a bit of annoyance.\n\"Well, the God said I should stay in the wilderness for two years,\" Shang repeated. \"But what if my Battle-Strength isn't the only reason?\"\nThe dean's eyebrows furrowed, and he looked at his table. \"Your Affinity?\" he asked.\nShang nodded. \"Right. The God said I would be able to use my Affinity if I'm lucky. That means that unlocking my Affinity is probably very hard. Maybe it's something that can only happen at a certain time?\"\n\"As you might already know, I have only been in the wilderness for a bit more than half a year, which is far less than two years.\"\n\"Is it possible that something will happen in the next one and a half years that could unlock my Affinity? Something like a rare or strange beast appearing? Maybe some kind of event?\" Shang asked.\nSuddenly, the dean's eyes widened.\nThen, he looked at Shang with an evaluating expression.\nShang saw that the dean had realized something. \"Did you think of something?\" he asked.\n\"There is a possibility,\" the dean said slowly as he scratched his chin in thought. \"It would also make sense to a certain degree. If I hadn't seen your current Affinity in action before, I wouldn't have connected it to that event.\"\n\"Could you be more specific?\" Shang asked.\n\"No,\" the dean answered. \"This involves one of the top secrets of the world. Technically, I am not even allowed to know of it, and the only reason I know is that I am very close to Duke Whirlwind.\"\n\"If it only involved my life, I wouldn't be afraid of telling you. After all, in the worst case, I can just flee and live in the wilderness. That doesn't bother me.\"\n\"However, I don't want to endanger my friend. Because of that, I can't tell you.\"\nWhen Shang heard that, he became quite frustrated, but he also realized something.\n'Earlier, the dean has talked about using everyone for his own power, but now, he is suddenly protecting his friend,' Shang thought. 'Has he lied previously?'\n'I don't think so. He looked pretty convincing earlier, but he also looks pretty convincing now.'\n'Maybe it's difficult to become close with him, but when you manage to become friends, he might be very loyal.'\n'However, I can't just assume his entire personality based on only this conversation. It's very possible that he also lied in one of those two moments.'\n'In the end, I should still keep my distance to some degree.'\n\"It's fine if you can't tell me, but can you at least tell me when it's about to happen?\" Shang asked.\nThe dean nodded. \"There is a certain event that takes place every couple of years. It involves some fighting and cleaning up of some rare and very troublesome beasts. No one in the world will realize that this has taken place since the ones that know it keep it a secret.\"\n\"The event should take place in a bit less than two years. I never cared about the corpses of these beasts, but if I put my money together, I can get one.\"\nThen, the dean looked into Shang's eyes. \"If there is a beast that has the same Affinity as the warrior undergoing the procedure, the procedure has a higher chance of success and will show greater results.\"\n\"Everything lines up pretty well. Your Affinity will probably be unlocked by the corpse since it will act similarly to a Mana Source, and you will receive something very compatible with you.\"\n\"We only have to wait for the right time.\"\nThen, the dean nodded as he made his decision.\n\"We've talked enough for now,\" the dean said. \"I now know how we should proceed.\"\nShang listened to the dean.\n\"First of all, you aren't allowed to reach the General Stage in the next two years. For the procedure, you have to remain in the Soldier Stage.\"\n\"Second, you need to use the next two years to increase your Battle-Strength.\"\n\"You will join the Caterpillar Class. That will take care of both of these things.\"\n\"Caterpillar Class?\" Shang asked in confusion.\n\"Soran will inform you,\" the dean said. \"I have to plan accordingly, and I need to earn a lot of money over the next two years to make your procedure possible. You won't see me much in the next two years. While I am away, listen to what the teachers tell you. I will inform them accordingly.\"\n\"Okay,\" Shang said. He felt like the conversation was ending a bit abruptly. However, he also realized that the conversation had also been very long.\nThe dean probably had things to do.\n\"I'll call you when necessary,\" the dean said.\nCreak!\nThe door creaked open on its own, and Shang felt Mana flow into the room again.\nThe dean had deactivated the Magic Circle, which had isolated them for the past half hour or so.\n\"Go,\" the dean ordered as he looked at some new papers he had just summoned. \"Your questions have wasted enough of my time. The only reason why I've taken my time to answer all of them is that you have a lot of potential.\"\nFor a second, Shang was confused why the dean said that. He had asked just as many questions.\nHowever, Shang realized why the dean had said that when he saw Soran waiting near the opened door.\nThe dean was putting on a show.\n\"Thank you, dean,\" Shang said as he stood up to leave.\nThe dean acted like he didn't pay any attention, but deep inside, he paid attention.\n'So young and naïve,' the dean thought. 'He doesn't realize that I am on the friendlier side when compared to others on my level.'\n'My openness towards the truth of the world frightens him and puts him off, but he doesn't know it.'\n'He's afraid because he is looking at what he will most likely become.'",

      "content": "Chapter 83 Subjects\nBANG!\nThe door closed behind Shang after he left the room. The end of the conversation still felt a bit abrupt for him, but he guessed that the dean simply didn't want to waste more time.\nNevertheless, Shang had learned an incredible amount of information from the dean.\nShang now knew what to do with his Affinity, and he knew his next goal.\nBecome more powerful in the next 18 months without reaching the General Stage.\nShang couldn't allow himself to reach the General Stage yet. Not only wouldn't he be able to truly grasp his Affinity, but he would also miss out on the dean's procedure.\nCould the procedure fail?\nUnder normal circumstances, Shang would believe the procedure to be incredibly risky. After all, he would undergo a procedure that had never succeeded before.\nHowever, Shang trusted in the God, or more precisely, he trusted in the God's desire for entertainment.\nThe God had suggested Shang to come here during a specific time, and the God wanted the warriors to become powerful again to bring variety back into his world.\nIt might be entertaining to gamble on a risky procedure for the God, but it was probably even more entertaining to see a warrior, an underdog in this world, go all the way.\n\"You talked for quite a while,\" Soran commented from the side.\nShang was pulled out of his thoughts and glanced at Soran. \"I had a lot of questions,\" he said.\n\"About the procedure?\" Soran asked.\nShang nodded. \"Have you already been informed?\" he asked.\n\"No, but it's obvious that Master would pick someone like you as his next subject,\" Soran said with a sigh. \"I still think it's a bit too early for actual tests on humans, but Master is confident in his theory.\"\n\"Have there been failures before?\" Shang asked.\nSoran nodded. \"Four failures in the last ten years,\" he answered.\n\"Four in ten years?\" Shang asked in surprise. \"I was expecting more like four failures in the last couple of months.\"\n\"The issue is the lack of robust test subjects,\" Soran explained. \"First of all, the subject must have a warrior's body. An increased rate of passive recovery is mandatory for survival since your body has to passively resist the destruction the new parts cause to it until everything finally fits together.\"\n\"For a while, it will be a war between your body and the beast parts. There can't be much outside influence during that period, or it will put the compatibility at risk.\"\n\"Another important part is being able to deal with pain. If you can't stay conscious during the procedure, your body will automatically enter a defensive state and will block everything from coming close.\"\n\"Then, you need to be in the First Realm, which limits a lot of candidates since they don't feel like they need such an invasive procedure yet. They lack the desperation that older warriors have.\"\n\"Lastly, they need to agree. Forcing this procedure on someone will most likely kill them since they won't comply, and due to the lack of trust, they would also believe that we were simply torturing them to death.\"\n\"Finding one of these things isn't difficult, but finding all of them is,\" Soran said with a sigh. \"Especially since a lot of them are rare together.\"\n\"Rare together? Why?\" Shang asked.\n\"Family status,\" Soran explained. \"This is the most prestigious warrior's academy in the world, and our standards are high. Contrary to what many might believe, a majority of our students are from rich and high-ranking families.\"\n\"How come?\" Shang asked. \"Wouldn't these families just become Mages anyway?\"\nSoran nodded. \"They would. If there is a way for their progeny to become Mages, they certainly won't send them here. Because of that, we only get the progeny with nearly no magical talent or those who aren't as important.\"\n\"But since we are the most prestigious academy in the world, that's still a lot of families that have their eyes on us for one of their progeny. That's where the first issue comes from. Those high-ranking families are high-ranking families precisely due to their bloodline and their talent for Magic. Warrior's bodies are very rare in their ranks.\"\n\"Then comes the pain part. Their progeny are sent here to learn how to be warriors, and being able to deal with pain is part of being a warrior. They only teach their children the basics before sending them here. Many of them have only fought a couple of captured beasts in a safe environment, and when they got injured, a Water Mage immediately arrived.\"\n\"Because of that, three of the four previous subjects came from low-ranking households,\" Soran said, but then, he sighed. \"However, the problem with the low-ranking households is that they have so few outstanding warriors. These households are common and weak for a reason. If they could create a powerful warrior, they wouldn't be a low-ranking household.\"\n\"A warrior on the Commander Stage can already become a minor noble without much issue.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Because of that, the few students from a poorer background that we have are either geniuses that managed to reach this step on their own or had amazing parents.\"\n\"All of this makes it very difficult to find subjects for the procedure.\"\nShang nodded. \"Makes sense.\"\nFor some seconds, no one said anything.\n\"I presume you are planning to go through with it?\" Soran asked.\nShang nodded. \"I can deal with pain, and I want to become more powerful. I know that the procedure is risky, but it's worth the risk for me,\" Shang said coldly as he looked forward.\nSoran saw Shang's eyes from the side and sighed. \"I knew from the very beginning that you are similar to Master. I shouldn't have expected otherwise.\"\nFor some reason, when Shang heard that he was similar to the dean, he felt himself become a bit angry.\nHe didn't like being compared to the dean.\nSoran was very experienced, and he could tell a lot of things from Shang's subtle reactions to his words.\n\"You shouldn't immediately think that Master is some sort of monster,\" Soran said. \"His words make him appear colder, more brutal, and more bloodthirsty than most people, but that's because you are used to how other people talk.\"\nShang threw Soran a glance from the side.\n\"Many people are polite and nice, but as soon as you step too close, they will try to keep you away,\" Soran said with a sigh. \"Even worse, if they ever believe you to be in their way in whatever way they can perceive, they suddenly stick a dagger into your back.\"\n\"That won't happen with Master, and if he ever decides to go against you, you will never be surprised about it. If he doesn't like you, he will ensure that you know.\"\n\"For example, he once had a friend, but that friend stole a technique of Master's to win against him in a competition. The friend came back with an embarrassed laugh and simply said that it was too important for him to win. Additionally, it was a competition.\"\nSoran smiled helplessly. \"Master then said that his friend should prepare himself because he will take his head when night comes. Obviously, his friend was stunned, and he shouted back at him that he was insane.\"\n\"In the end, the friend didn't leave or run away and simply went home. Well, just as promised, he died that night.\"\n\"So, in a way, Master can be very coldhearted and brutal, but he is very honest. He won't ever call you a friend if he isn't your friend. Of course, he also puts a lot of importance on honesty from others. If you don't want to end on his bad side, you should avoid lying,\" Soran said.\nShang remembered how the dean had reacted when Shang had played dumb. Sure enough, the dean had become very angry back then.\nIf Soran's words were correct, this also explained why the dean was willing to protect Duke Whirlwind. Shang knew the dean's deepest secret, which was his past as another person from Earth. Yet, even under such circumstances, the dean still refused to betray one of Duke Whirlwind's secrets.\nShang could respect something like that, but for some reason, he still didn't like the dean.\nIn Shang's mind, the dean seemed a bit similar to him, and he had several qualities Shang appreciated.\nBut why was exactly that thought so uncomfortable to him?\n\"I presume you will join the Caterpillar Class?\" Soran asked.\nShang nodded.",

Additionally, the dean told me that I should hone my Battle-Strength as much as I can before reaching the General Stage.\"\n\"Correct,\" Soran said with a nod. \"By the way, when is your procedure scheduled?\"\n\"Not for another 18 months or so.\"\nSoran lifted an eyebrow. \"That's quite a long time. It seems like Master puts a lot of emphasis on your growth. In my eyes, your Battle-Strength is already enough for you to reach the General Stage.\"\nThen, Soran shrugged. \"However, that's why I'm a Commander Stage warrior and why Master is a True Path Stage Warrior. He knows better than me.\"\n\"Anyway,\" Soran said as he took out a book from his Space Ring. \"This is a copy of the rules and your schedule.\"\nShang took the book into his hands.\nSHING!\nSoran summoned another book, this one far bigger than the other one. \"And these are all the techniques you will learn.\"\nShang looked at the new book with furrowed brows. \"All of them? Just like that? I thought I would need Contribution Points or something like that.\"\n\"Usually, you would need Contribution Points for the valuable techniques. However, as a student of the Caterpillar Class, you don't need your Contribution Points for those techniques.\"\n\"Because you are not allowed to learn them.\"\nShang frowned when he heard that. \"Not allowed to learn them? Then why am I even here?\" he asked.\nSoran chuckled a bit. \"It's for your future, trust me,\" Soran explained. \"Have you thought about why the True Path Stage is called the True Path Stage?\"\n\"I didn't even know of the True Path Stage until I came here, and I hadn't had the time to think about the name,\" Shang commented.\n\"The True Path Stage is called as such since reaching the True Path Stage requires you to create your own path. Ironically, the True Path doesn't refer to the one true path, but to the True Path in your eyes.\"\n\"Master uses a spear, and he fights in a very domineering manner. He has found his path. However, his path isn't your path. The reason why no one was able to reach the True Path Realm in the past was that everyone learned from the strongest warriors, which essentially was just copying their paths.\"\n\"Learning advanced techniques and abilities will influence you and make it harder for you to create your own path. You already have your own personalized way of fighting. Of course, as it is now, your fighting style still has a lot of weaknesses, but instead of switching to a different style, you have to further refine and evolve your style.\"\nShang wasn't certain what he should think of that. \"Then what am I even learning here? This is an academy, is it not? Am I not supposed to learn things?\"\n\"Not for students of your class,\" Soran said. \"You are your own teachers. We actual teachers are only there to guide you in the right direction and provide different kinds of services. Our dynamic is more along the lines of experienced seniors and juniors.\"\n\"We are not going to show you what you should do. We are going to show you what your opponents will do. It is up to you to find a way to deal with said opponents.\"\nShang scratched his chin. 'So, this academy is more like a fitness gym than a fighting dojo. There are trainers walking around in the gym, but they only give advice when asked. They don't specifically hold lessons on how to craft the perfect body,' Shang thought.\n'On earth, this wouldn't make much sense. After all, there is only so much a human body can do. But here? I can imagine this being more effective in the long run.'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang took the book of techniques.\nSHING!\nSoran summoned a small emblem. On the Emblem was the picture of a muscular arm in black armor, ready to strike down with a spear.\n\"This is a Magic Emblem,\" Soran said. \"It's your identification, key, and payment method for Contribution Points. You have an assigned room in this building near the front of the second floor. Just hold the Emblem to the door, and it will open. No one but the teachers and you can open your door.\"\n\"If you want to move to the Farm Line, you can do so, but go to your room first. Your uniforms are there, and you should get them first. If you decide to live in the Farm Line, tell us. There's no reason to keep a room reserved for someone that doesn't want to live there.\"\nShang took the Emblem and nodded. \"Thanks,\" he said absentmindedly.\n\"You can find all the relevant information in the first book,\" Soran said, gesturing to the first book. \"If you have any additional questions, simply ask a teacher. I'm sorry, but I've already spent a big part of my day dealing with your impromptu exam, and I actually need to get started on my day-to-day duties. Just look around and get familiar with the academy first.\"\n\"Sorry for keeping you,\" Shang said absentmindedly.\n\"It's fine. Come, you can't be on this floor without a teacher beside you,\" Soran said as he gestured to the end of the hallway.\nShang took the hint and walked towards the stairs, Soran following. When Shang reached the fourth floor, Soran quickly said his goodbyes and went back to the fifth floor.\nNow, Shang was alone for the first time in what felt like a very long time.\nShang looked out of one of the windows and saw that it was noon.\n'This day feels like it has gone on forever, but it's just noon.'\nThen, Shang looked down at his Emblem. 'Anyway, I am now part of the Warrior's Academy, and that's why I'm here.'\n'In just one morning, I joined the academy and learned so much about the world, myself, and my future.'\n'I should go to my room and read through that book of rules and my schedule.'",

      "content": "Chapter 85 Room\nShang left the fourth floor and went to the second one. Soran had said that Shang would find his room near the beginning of the second floor.\nWhen Shang arrived on the second floor, he saw a long hallway with a lot of doors. Shang guessed that the rooms weren't very big based on how close the doors were to each other.\nShang wasn't quite sure which room was supposed to be his, but he knew that he only needed to test his Emblem on the different rooms. The one that reacted to it would be his.\nShang went to the first door on the right and held his Emblem to it.\nClick.\nAnd it unlocked.\nShang was surprised when the very first door unlocked, and he looked at his card. 'Did I just get lucky, or is my card defect?'\nShang went to the room beside it and tried his Emblem.\nThe door didn't react.\nShang tried to open the door, but it wouldn't budge.\nShang nodded. His Emblem wasn't defective, and the very first room was his. He walked back to his room and opened his door.\n\"What?\" someone said with annoyance as they opened the door where Shang had just been at.\nShang looked over and saw a gruff and muscular boy, probably around his age. At least, that was what Shang was assuming. Those muscles made it hard for Shang to associate this boy with a teenager.\n\"Sorry, I wasn't sure which my room was, so I tested my card on your door,\" Shang said with as friendly of a tone as he could. For some reason, trying to be friendly felt very tiring to him.\nThe boy looked over at Shang with an evaluating expression. \"I don't know you. Are you new here?\" he asked.\nShang nodded. \"Special exam. Joined just today,\" he answered.\n\"Oh?\" the boy commented with surprise. \"What class have you been assigned to?\"\n\"The Caterpillar Class.\"\nWhen the boy heard that, he frowned. \"Welcome to hell, freshwater guppy,\" the boy said with a snort.\nShang lifted an eyebrow, but the boy went back into his room and closed his door.\nFor a while, Shang only looked at the closed door. 'Judging by his derisive snort, he probably didn't refer to my class. Is this some kind of stupid bullying?'\n'Also, freshwater guppy? Did the guy come from the 50s? Who talks like that?'\n'Well, it doesn't really matter. I've been in the wilderness for long enough, and life in the academy should be a joke in comparison.'\nWith that thought, Shang entered his room and closed the door.\nWhen Shang saw his room, he saw exactly what he had expected.\nSmall.\nThere was a narrow bed with some stuff on it, and the remainder of the room was empty.\nLiterally.\nNo table, no chairs, no drawers, no wardrobe, nothing.\n'They really don't want us to have any distractions. If I were to live here, I would practically be forced into training just due to boredom. Is this solitary confinement?'\nFirst, Shang put everything he was carrying down in his room. Finally, he no longer needed to carry his heavy bag, his gold, and all of these books.\nEven better, he didn't even need to carry all of this stuff with him. He could just leave everything in this room from now on.\nEver since Shang had gotten here, his home had been a budget version of a cardboard box that a homeless person would use to live in.\nAt least a homeless person had a roof over their head with their cardboard box. Shang hadn't even had that.\nAfter Shang stretched, he looked at all the different stuff near his bed.\nHe saw eight uniforms, all of them green. 'Really, green? Do you have to go that far with the caterpillar thing?'\nBeside the eight green uniforms, Shang saw eight bronze uniforms, and beside those were two azure uniforms.\nWhen Shang saw these uniforms, he thought back to this morning. He had seen many students approach the academy with different uniforms. What kind of uniforms had they worn?\nA lot of them had worn bronze uniforms.\nA couple of the others had been green, blue, red…\nThere had been a couple of different colors, and Shang wasn't even sure if he had remembered all of them.\nShang only knew two things for sure.\nOne, bronze was the most common color.\nTwo, the teachers wore silver.\nShang inspected his uniforms and realized that they were far heavier than he had anticipated. They probably weighed nearly 20 kilograms all on their own!\nThat was the equivalent of weight a soldier would wear when going to war on Earth!\nBut this was only a uniform. It didn't even have any special plating or armor on it.\nShang remembered that the silver uniform of the teachers had looked a bit like a fusion between armor and normal clothing while the students had worn these.\nShang looked closer at the green uniform and noticed the shoes.\n'Am I a fucking leprechaun?' he thought with a frown when he saw the shoes. 'Wait, are leprechauns even wearing green shoes? Their entire attire is green, so their shoes should also be green, right?'\n'Never mind, what are these ridiculous shoes?!' he thought.\nThe shoes were green and very… naturey? That word worked.\n'Well, it doesn't really matter. I won't be the only one walking around in this ridiculous getup,' he thought.\nBut then, Shang saw the bronze uniform.\nIt looked good.\nOn top of that, it had black boots.\nShang looked back at the green uniform.\n'Let's read the rulebook first before I decide on what to wear. Maybe these uniforms have a certain purpose,' Shang thought as his eyes went to the next object. 'Anyway, why are there two buckets here?'\nBeside the bed, Shang saw two buckets. One was filled with water. One was empty.\nShang looked around the room.\nThen, at the empty bucket.\n'Am I supposed to shit in that?'\nShang didn't see a toilet, and he didn't see any kind of draining mechanism in the room.\nEver since Shang's body had reached the higher levels of the Soldier Stage, his need to drop a deuce had decreased significantly, but once a week, even he had to press out a stinky one.\nFor now, Shang decided to wait until he read the rulebook, and his focus went to the waterfilled bucket. 'Is this for washing or drinking? Probably for drinking. After all, how am I supposed to get the water out of the room when there's no drain?'\nAnd that was it. That was everything inside Shang's room.\nThere wasn't even a big window. The window could barely be called a slit.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ It was just an absolutely empty room, even more barren than a prisoner's cell. No wonder most students decided to live in the Farm Line. In the Farm Line, they had nature, bigger rooms, more freedom, and more stuff to do.\nAfter having seen his room, Shang grabbed the rulebook and began to read.\nHe sat down on his bed, which was way harder than a bed should be. However, Shang didn't really care about the hardness of his bed. He had slept on trees for far too long to care.\nThen, Shang opened the rulebook.",

      "content": "Chapter 86 Rules\nThe book had only about thirty pages, which didn't take very long to read. A big part of the book was about rules regarding fighting, attending lessons, how to obtain Contribution Points, the functions of the room, and some general information.\nFrom what Shang had read, fighting with one's weapon was forbidden, but fighting without a weapon was fine. The reason for such a choice was to preserve the killing intent in someone. If someone used their killing tool to spar with others a lot, they might lose their killing intent.\nBecause of that, the academy tried to preserve the killing intent of the weapon. One should only draw one's weapon when one intended to kill someone.\nOf course, there were exceptions. For example, two students could schedule an official spar at any of the training areas. In that case, they could use their weapon.\nBut wait, how did that differ from just fighting normally? After all, it was also just a spar.\nThe difference was that the students had to fight with the intent of killing the other person. It was not in their responsibility to keep the opponent safe. The observing teacher would be responsible for keeping the loser alive.\nSo, the student would still be fighting with the goal of killing their opponent. It was just that the opponent would survive due to outside intervention.\nAttending lessons was surprisingly completely optional. No student was forced to attend the lessons.\nThis rule existed to teach students responsibility.\nOn earth, something like this wouldn't really work. After all, the consequences of getting bad grades weren't immediate as long as someone didn't fail the grade. This made the danger distant, making the student feel like they weren't actually in danger.\nBut here, it would have very real consequences. Due to the first rule, bullying and ganging up on others were allowed. If a teacher saw five kids beating up a younger student, they wouldn't intervene.\nHowever, the survival of that student would also be under the assailants' responsibilities. If they killed a student without a good reason, the assailants would be executed by the academy.\nEven more, if someone didn't have a warrior's body, they would need to go to the resident Water Mage to get themselves healed, and the cost of the treatment would need to come out of their own pocket.\nSo, it was literally possible to push someone into impossible poverty. If someone made some serious enemies, they could be suppressed into always being forced to remain in their rooms in the academy. This would stop them from attending lessons, earning money, and training.\nHow did one get out of such a situation?\nThat was not the academy's problem.\nStrength ruled supreme. Either the students would become powerful or break.\nAs for earning Contribution Points, there were three ways.\nOne was to attend lessons.\nYes, the students got paid for attending lessons. Of course, they had to seriously attend them and not just be present. Teachers could deduct the pay for a lesson if they thought that a student slacked off.\nAnother method was doing a mission. There were a couple of mission boards around the school that offered different missions. The rewards for these missions were many times higher than attending lessons for several reasons.\nFirst of all, this was practical experience. The student would be sent out without supervision or protection. There was a very real chance of the student dying.\nSecond, the people commissioning the missions were paying the academy in exotic materials, which allowed the academy to keep its marketplace going. Of course, the student had to be adequately rewarded.\nThe last way to earn Contribution Points was simply for a teacher to assign them. A teacher could assign Contribution Points, but they would have to justify that decision to one of the Vice-Deans. If the reason wasn't good enough, the Contribution Points would be deducted from the teacher's personal account.\nThe next thing was the function of the room, and Shang was thankful that they actually wrote about it. If they hadn't described the room, Shang would have made a horrible mistake.\nThat empty bucket?\nIt was imbued with Magic.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ What kind of Magic?\nIt was Transportation Magic.\nThe bottom of the bucket was connected to a space with a couple of Water Apprentices and Water Adepts. Their job was to create water for the students.\nAs long as someone tilted the bucket into a position that was impossible for it to be in with no interference, water would flow. This was to stop an accidental activation of the Magic Circle. Without that, the Water Mage would fill the entire room if the bucket fell over.\nIn short, someone had to lift the bucket and slightly tilt it to activate the Magic Array. Then, a stream of water would come out of the bucket until the bucket was put back into a normal position.\nIf Shang had shat into the bucket…\nShang imagined a log coming out of a Magic Array in front of a Water Mage.\nThat would have been awkward.\nThe other bucket was simply a normal bucket.\nThe water coming out of the bucket was for both washing and drinking. Surprisingly, there was also a drain for exactly this reason.\nShang looked to the corner of the room and saw a slightly lowered circle.\nIt was a Magic Circle, and it was responsible for dumping the dirty water into the Wasteland.\n'Why did they not just make a normal drain with normal pipes? Why did they even use Magic to transport shit?'\nShang didn't know it, but there were two reasons, one more ridiculous than the other.\nOne, the Earth Mages assigned to develop the city had been bored. So, they simply created a huge magical sewer under the entire city and gave everyone access to it.\nSecond, because they could.\nWouldn't it be funny if they transported such unimportant stuff with Transportation Magic, which was a subcategory of Space Magic?\nThat was the reason.\nLastly, Shang looked at the description of the uniforms.\nIn total, there were seven different colors.\nThe first one was the azure uniform, which Shang had two of.\nThe azure uniforms were for special occasions and were forbidden from being worn without explicit permission from a teacher.\nIn short, those uniforms were for impressing visitors. That was also why Shang had only two of them.\nBronze uniforms, which Shang had eight of, were general uniforms. Those were for people that didn't want others to know about which class they were in. Usually, one would think that this was pointless. After all, wouldn't everyone realize which class everyone was in based on which lessons they visited?\nNo. Everyone could literally visit every lesson, and there were plenty of students attending plenty of classes due to the Contribution Point reward.\nThe green uniforms, which Shang had eight of, were for the Caterpillar Class.\nYellow uniforms were for students aspiring to be soldiers in Duke Whirlwind's army. Initially, when students joined the academy, they would wear bronze uniforms until they reached the Late Soldier Stage. At that point, they would have to decide on their future.\nBecoming a member of Duke Whirlwind's army was the most common goal. The pay was good. The status was good. There wasn't much work to do.\nIt was simply a good and stable job.\nBlue uniforms were for people aspiring to become officers. Many students initially wanted to go that route, but the requirements were far more stringent than for the people wanting to be normal soldiers. Because of that, most people transferred classes rather quickly.\nRed uniforms were for people aspiring to be Mage Hunters. In this world, it was nearly impossible to kill a Mage on their level alone, but that didn't mean that warriors became useless. With a lot of warriors, one could still take care of a couple of Mages.\nThis world wasn't peaceful, and Duke Whirlwind's enemies also had Mages.\nSadly, there weren't many students interested in becoming Mage Hunters. The reason was obvious.\nThey didn't want to die.\nAttacking a Mage was about the most dangerous thing one could do.\nIt was scary to fight against someone that could turn someone into literal dust just by saying a couple of words.\nThe last color for uniforms was black. This was for scouts and normal hunters.\nThat one scout that had brought Shang to Warrior's Paradise had probably graduated from that class.\nThe people from that class learned how to kill beasts and how to stay hidden.\nAccording to the book, most assassins also came from this class.\nAfter looking through the rulebook, Shang looked at the schedule.\nAnd his eyes widened in shock.",

      "content": "Chapter 87 Schedule And Grade\nWhen Shang saw the schedule, his eyes widened.\n'So many lessons!'\nEvery single spot, from dawn to early night, was filled with lessons!\nEven more, several lessons overlapped, making it impossible to visit all of them!\nAnd, apparently, there were even some lessons held at night, but they weren't held inside the academy.\nShang had thought that there wouldn't be that many lessons. After all, this was an academy for warriors, not doctors.\nShang looked over a couple of lessons.\nBasic sword fighting.\nBasic spear fighting.\nBasic…\nAdvanced sword fighting.\nAdvanced spear fighting.\nAdvanced…\nExpert sword fighting.\nExpert spear fighting.\nExpert…\nThere were so many different lessons for all kinds of weapons. Swords, sabers, bows, hammers, halberds, shields, and so on.\nThe weapon-related lessons happened twice a day and ate up three hours each.\nThese lessons were colored in bronze, which meant that they were suitable for everyone. The colors of the lessons were identical to the colors of the uniforms. It wasn't forbidden to partake in a class for a different color, but the knowledge gained from that class might not be applicable to one's chosen profession.\nOf course, there were also lessons for many different classes, and the colored lessons were the ones that overlapped the most. The general lessons never overlapped with colored ones, but they did overlap with each other. After all, if someone used a spear, they probably weren't very interested in sword lessons.\nAn example of a colored lesson was the operation of general weaponry for the army, which was colored in yellow. The lesson taught the operation of large war machinery, such as ballista, catapults, siege towers, and so on.\nOf course, not every lesson revolved around fighting. Another yellow lesson revolved around profiling other people to stop crime and general knowledge about how different people in cities operated, which made sense.\nIf the soldiers weren't going to war, they were overlooking the cities as a form of police force. The students coming from this academy were the best of the best, and they wouldn't be the ones that just stood in front of a gate the entire day. Because of that, they needed lots of knowledge about society.\nThe blue lessons were just absolutely filled with complex topics. They revolved all around leadership, tactics, social skills, nobility, etiquette, asset management, and so on. The blue lessons were probably the most numerous, and if someone decided to join that class, they would find nearly their entire day filled out.\nBut on top of that, the officers also needed to be more powerful than the normal students. After all, this was a world where strength reigned supreme.\nIn short, the students from the blue class needed to learn theory the entire day and train harder during the night than the other students trained during the day.\nShang could guess why there were only so few students wearing blue uniforms.\nIt was brutal.\nThe red class only had two unique lessons. One was a lesson that prepared them for fights against Mages, while the other one was all about the life of Mages. The first was the practical side, while the second was the theoretical side.\nThe black classes mostly revolved around scouting, tracking, hiding, assassination, and knowledge about beasts in general.\nAnd the green class, the Caterpillar Class?\nThey literally only had a single lesson, but it took place every day for three hours.\nIt was simply called guided fighting practice.\nFrom what Shang had read, guided fighting practice involved the student fighting against teachers. In a way, this lesson was identical to Shang's short fight with Soran, with the difference of actually getting feedback during the fight.\nAfter Shang had looked over all the classes, he decided to create a timetable for himself. Luckily, he didn't need to submit anything since there were no grades. There was simply an annual exam that every student had to take part in. The exams were different for each class and mostly involved the relevant topics for that class.\nThis single exam was make or break.\nNothing else mattered.\nIf someone failed, they had proven to be too weak for the academy, and they would be expelled.\nEvery year, over 10% of the students were expelled during the exams.\nIt was brutal in a way, but it also had its good sides. For example, Shang could replan his schedule whenever he wanted. If Shang became too stressed, he could simply skip some lessons or attend other ones without any repercussions. Only his power was relevant.\nWhen Shang thought about the exams, he also noticed what kind of schedule he had received.\nJust like with any other school, the different classes were all categorized under different grades.\nThe Beginner Grade was for the new students, who all wore bronze uniforms. They were a bit older than 14 on average.\nThe Intermediate Grade was for students that reached the Middle Soldier Stage. Half of them still wore bronze uniforms, while the other half had already made their decision. The average age was a bit over 16.\nThe Advanced Grade was for students in the Late Soldier Stage. It was a requirement to choose one's class before advancing to that Grade, which was why everyone was already specialized. The average age was a bit over 18.\nThen came the Preparation Grade. This was for students at the Peak Soldier Stage. As the name suggested, this Grade was for students preparing to reach the Second Realm, the General Stage.\nWhen one managed to reach a sufficient Battle-Strength after having advanced to the General Stage, one could graduate.\nHowever, one could also choose to remain here for special training.\nThis special training was the very thing that made this academy the best one in the world.\nNearly everyone wanted to take part in the special training, but only the best managed to enter.\nWhat did the special training aim for?\nTo get the students to the Commander Stage.\nThe Commander Stage was the publicly acknowledged highest Realm for warriors since there was only a single True Path Stage warrior.\nIn short, if someone managed to graduate from special training, they would leave the academy as one of the strongest warriors in the world.\nNo other academy in the world had the means to push students to the Commander Stage.\nA Commander Stage warrior was a big deal. Nearly all of them would be knighted and would be granted their own small territory. However, the word small referred to the general size of a noble's territory here. This \"small\" territory was still a couple hundred meters across.\nWhen put in relation to Earth, graduating from this academy meant already having tens of millions of dollars and already having a sizable company.\nAs soon as someone graduated from that program, they had already achieved great success.\nAnd they hadn't even entered the real world yet!\nOf course, all of this was still far in the future for Shang.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ So, what Grade was Shang in?\nTechnically, as someone at the Peak of the Soldier Stage, he should join the Preparation Grade.\nBut that didn't happen.\nWhy?\nBecause Shang wasn't focusing on reaching the General Stage. He was focusing on increasing his power.\nDue to these reasons, Shang was put into the Advanced Grade.\nA Grade filled with 19- and 20-year-olds.\nAnd Shang?\nHis body had maybe just reached its 15th birthday.",

      "content": "Chapter 88 Training Resumes\nShang didn't know what he should think of his assigned Grade.\nOn one hand, he was technically 23 years old by now. He had spent 22 years on Earth and one year here.\nThe older one got, the less age mattered. In a way, 20-year-olds were seen as young adults. They were mostly able to live on their own and take care of themselves, and their minds had matured to a significant degree.\nBecause of that, Shang wouldn't have felt awkward or out of place in a Grade filled with people in their early twenties. The age difference didn't matter much.\nHowever, 18 and 20 were quite a difference. 18-year-olds were showing signs of maturity. One of these obvious signs was the lower frequency of bullying in colleges. High school was far worse in that sense.\nBut that age was still a big dividing line of maturity. Probably half of the class would consist of teenagers while the other half would be young adults, personality-wise.\nWith all of that in mind, Shang also had to look at his body.\nSure, his mind was the mind of a 23-year-old, but his body was of a 15-year-old.\nHe hadn't even finished growing properly.\nAt the moment, Shang was 150cm tall, which was probably about average for someone of that age, but he would definitely get another growth spurt.\nAs for his classmates?\nThey had already all mostly finished growing. Sure, men could grow even when they were 20, but those couple of centimeters didn't make a huge difference.\nIn short, Shang would appear like a kid to the other people in his Grade. Half of them would probably not mind and would be quite open, but the other half would probably look down on him.\nNow, one shouldn't misunderstand.\nShang wasn't distraught about how others perceived him but about the annoying trouble he would have to go through.\nShang wasn't very interested in socializing. Back on Earth, he had been an outgoing person, but that was also only because he couldn't train 24/7.\nIn this world, he could.\nAnd since training and growing more powerful took priority, Shang essentially had no interest in socializing.\nYet, the others would try to force him, and he didn't want to deal with all that trouble.\n'Well, doesn't really matter. It's probably just a couple of instances, and as long as I make myself clear, most of my classmates shouldn't mind.'\n'But it's actually a bit funny that I will have the most powerful body of my Grade.'\nShang's brows furrowed.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ 'Why is that anyway?' Shang thought. 'I reached this level in only half a year. Sure, I had a ton of fruits from the Earth Fruit Hedgehog, but the academy should have even better stuff, right?'\n'Even more, the new students of the academy already start training at 14 years of age. Meanwhile, they only reached the Peak of the Soldier Stage in their early twenties. That's six years of training.'\n'I mean, I trained a lot, but that can't be the only reason, can it?'\nThe books hadn't said anything about how to train one's body and how to advance. Shang guessed that the teachers were probably responsible for that.\n'I'll learn that later anyway. For now, I should focus on actually growing more powerful. With all of this theoretical stuff out of the way, I can finally focus on my power again.'\nShang looked at the small slit that was his window with absent eyes.\n'The last time I was fully focused on my power was actually when I was still in the wilderness. Only a week had passed since then, but it feels like forever.'\nShang's eyes went to his belongings and then to his mostly empty room.\n'I don't need to think about food.'\n'I don't need to think about water.'\n'I don't need to think about shelter.'\n'I don't need to think about some bullshit school knowledge and bullshit tests.'\n'I don't need to think about how to earn money.'\n'I don't even need to think about family or friends.'\nFor a while, Shang simply looked at his room in silence.\nIt was such a weird feeling.\nFor the past six months or so, Shang had to constantly worry about survival. Even more, he hadn't even been able to truly let himself go in training. After all, he had never been truly safe. Plenty of beasts had been prepared to attack Shang during his training in the past.\nBut here?\n…Nothing…\nEven more, Shang didn't even have to follow an actual schedule. As long as his power progressed at sufficient speeds, he would be golden. He could even skip every single class if he wanted.\nIn a way, the academy was also a form of wilderness. After all, fighting wasn't prohibited.\nHowever, students undergoing the special training weren't allowed to get involved with conflicts inside the academy, and those students were the only ones that could be a threat to Shang.\n'Wait!' Shang thought with urgency. 'That's wrong!'\nShang narrowed his eyes.\n'There is a difference between self-confidence and arrogance. Soran managed to easily beat me with a body two levels below mine. Because of that, it wouldn't be too farfetched that someone with a body one level below mine could pull off something similar.'\n'And even more, there is a big difference between individual quality. There are the outstanding ones and the substandard ones. On top of that, everyone in my Grade has learned how to fight other humans for years. Many of them have probably also already killed humans.'\n'It might actually be possible that my Battle-Strength is below theirs when it involves fighting against other humans. I might actually only count as average in my Grade even with my powerful body.'\n'I need to be careful.'\n…\n'Oh, wait,' Shang thought as his body relaxed.\n'Fighting with weapons is prohibited between students.'\n'What was I even worrying about?'\n'I think I'm too used to being in an environment filled with danger. I automatically assumed that the other students were out to kill me.'\nShang involuntarily got reminded of his conversation with that one guard from Duke Whirlwind's garden. The guard had told Shang that he wasn't used to being with other humans.\n'I should try to keep in mind that not everyone is out to get me. Even if someone doesn't like me, they will probably just not talk to me, which is fine.'\nShang sighed.\n'This will require some getting used to, and I can't force it. For now, I should focus on my power. Tomorrow, I will start with the classes.'\n'For today, I just want to train.'\nShang put everything to the side and grabbed the book filled with techniques.\nWhen Shang opened the book, he read the introduction.\n'Huh, interesting,' Shang thought after he finished. 'They're literally telling me to just experiment. Try the techniques and adapt whichever one I like. Even more, the techniques are very basic and simple on purpose. They are just very basic movements with some slight variations.'\nShang went through the first couple of techniques and immediately knew how they worked.\nSure, Shang was intelligent, but he wasn't some unreal genius that could understand complex stuff in an instant.\nIt was just that the techniques really were very simple.\nAfter looking at the first couple of techniques, Shang stood up and grabbed his sword.\nThen, he swung.\nShang had great control over his body, and he had nearly perfectly copied the slash, but then, he felt something weird.\nShang looked with surprise at the sword in his hand.\nFor some reason, Shang could feel its feelings.\nAnd right now, the sword felt slightly disgusted.\nIt was like someone had slightly gone against the hairs while petting a cat. It wasn't crazy enough to get angry or jump away, but it definitely didn't enjoy the sensation.\nShang raised an eyebrow.\n\"You don't like that one?\" he asked.\nNo answer.\nShang only felt the slight disgust slowly vanish.\n'Hmm, it probably can't understand me.'\nIf this had happened the day before, he would have been shocked by the sudden feelings Shang was receiving from his sword. However, Shang had already seen that his sword wasn't simple. After all, it had gone to the dean's spear of its own volition.\nOn top of that, the dean's spear had taught it something. At least that was what the dean had said.\nShang reviewed the first technique again and found some small flaws in his movements.\nThen, he swung again.\nAfter that, Shang looked with a raised eyebrow at his sword.\n\"Now, you definitely didn't like that one, huh?\"\nThe sword hated it.",

      "content": "Chapter 89 Sword Feelings\nShang looked at his sword with a lifted eyebrow. Earlier, he had assumed that his sword didn't like the technique because he hadn't perfectly used it. After all, the sword had only been mildly disgusted, not completely.\nBut apparently, it was the opposite.\nThe sword really didn't like the technique.\n\"What don't you like?\" Shang asked.\nHe still felt a bit weird talking to his sword like it was another person or a pet, but he knew that he should get used to it.\nOf course, the sword didn't answer.\nShang had a couple of suspicions, but they would need further testing.\nSo, Shang tried the second technique. All of these techniques were short, singular movements. They weren't a complex array of complicated moves or something like that. At most, they described how one should move one's arms generally and how one should move their legs. One could call these techniques even basic instruction manuals.\nWhen Shang finished the technique, his sword gave feedback again.\nIt felt a bit weird.\nIt was like it was eating something with an unknown flavor. It was like it wasn't certain if it should like that flavor or not.\nAfter unleashing the strike and feeling the sword's feedback, Shang stopped with a frown.\nHe felt the sword's feelings to be familiar.\n'Actually, I felt similar to the sword,' Shang thought. 'Although, during the first technique, I wasn't as disgusted as it. However, I still didn't like it.'\n'Why is that? Why do I not like this technique?' Shang thought as he scratched his chin.\nShang thought back to the first technique.\nThe first technique was an upward slice with a simultaneous jump to the back. The purpose of this slice was to reset the flow of battle.\nIn a battle, one side nearly always had the advantage. One of the two sides was very often the aggressive one, while the other one had to react. The reason why one side could be aggressive in the first place was that the other side had been unable to completely stop the aggression.\nBeing on the offensive in a fight was incredibly advantageous.\nIf one performed a subpar strike during one's offense, no one would get injured.\nHowever, if one performed a subpar block, one would be injured.\nSo, as long as the offensive side didn't lose the offense, they could theoretically continue attacking forever. They only had to wait for their opponent to make a mistake.\nNow, the first technique, the upward slice with the jump to the back, was a technique to get one out of such a bind. The upward slice would include nearly all of the power of the user, and since it went from the bottom to the top, it basically went through the entire fighting space.\nThis slice was meant to threaten the opponent with an attack and also block a strike, as long as they used a fitting strike during that time. Not every technique could be used under all circumstances.\nSo, with the opponent attacked and their own attack blocked, the user could jump back, resetting the fight. At that point, the opponent would lose their momentum, and the two of them could have their first clash again, which often decided the offensive and defensive side.\nThe sword had hated that technique, and Shang also hadn't been the biggest fan of it. However, he had still been willing to give it a try.\n'Why don't I like the first technique?' Shang thought as he scratched his chin.\n'It definitely has its uses. If I were in a passive situation, it would definitely be useful. Just looking at its performance, I see no flaws. It's a good strike.'\nShang thought about this situation a bit more.\n'It just feels wrong,' Shang thought with a frown. 'I mean, it is strong. I can't deny that. It's also very useful.'\n'But it just feels wrong. It's like it's disrupting my flow or my rhythm.'\nShang scratched the back of his head. 'I mean, that's the point, right? It's supposed to disrupt the flow of the battle.'\n'I'm not entirely sure why, but I think the issue is that I simply don't like it. It's like some amazing series TV show about crime. Everyone loves it, and every crime fanatic recommends it. However, I don't like crime shows.'\n'I just don't like them.'\nShang looked at his sword.\n'I guess it's similar with this technique? I can see the quality, but I just don't like it.'\n'What about the second technique? The sword felt unfamiliar with this technique, and I know why.'\n'I've never really used something like this.'\nThe second technique had been a feint. Feints had the goal of making the opponent move in a certain manner, which would make it harder for them to react to unsuspecting attacks. In short, feints attempted to take away the reactive flexibility of the opponent.\nThe second technique was a slash that came from the top right, but instead of slashing at the enemy, it went into a curve and went back to the right side, but on a lower level. This left the user in a very wide and open stance, but it also gave them a lot of space and wind-up time for a devastating strike.\nIf the opponent fell for the feint, they would have either slashed to their left or blocked.\nIf they slashed towards the feint, they would be caught off-guard, literally. Their equilibrium and power would be fully focused on their front. If they decided to block, they would lose their opportunity to counterattack.\nAttacks with long wind-up times were risky since the enemy could simply unleash a quick counter. If a boxer just suddenly started pulling back their shoulders to unleash a devastating hook, the enemy would unleash a quick jab at them.\nOf course, a quick jab wasn't really devastating to a boxer.\nHowever, if that quick jab were accompanied by a sharp weapon, things would be different.\nGoing for wide swings left someone open to quick stabs.\nBut with the feint, the enemy wouldn't be in a situation to take advantage of the opening, which gave the user of the feint the opportunity to unleash a devastating strike. Even if such a strike didn't hit the body of the opponent, the opponent would still be thrown back. They might even fall down.\nShang hadn't really used any feints up to now.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Why?\nBecause he had only really been fighting beasts.\nWeapons were hard and could block Shang's sword, but beasts couldn't easily block it. If they tried to block it with anything, that thing would most likely be cut off. Because of that, nearly all beasts focused on evasion instead of blocking.\nAs for parrying?\nBeasts were too stupid for that.\nBecause of that, beasts could only avoid attacks or counter with an offense.\nThat was why Shang felt unfamiliar with this technique.\nAnd the feelings of his sword reflected that.\n'So, the sword is actually reflecting my own feelings, but with more clarity,' Shang thought as he scratched his chin. 'Although I can't be sure if it is reflecting my current feelings or if these are its own feelings. They could also just be identical since it went through all the training I did. After all, how am I supposed to train my swordsmanship without a sword?'\n'This means that this is either a mirror of my current feelings or simply a case of feeling the feelings of an identical twin.'\n'Is my sword its own being with its own feelings, or do its feelings come from my own mental state?'",

      "content": "Chapter 90 Practice\nFor now, Shang couldn't find the answer. The sword was still too young, simple, and inexperienced. It couldn't even react to Shang's words. Additionally, the dean had said that the sword would be of a bigger help if it absorbed some ore, and Shang was pretty sure that the dean wasn't only referring to the weapon physically becoming stronger.\nShang decided that he should simply continue as it was right now and use the sword as some sort of mirror, but he also knew that he had to verify the sword's feelings every time. At the moment, it seemed to reflect his own feelings, but those feelings might change, and if Shang didn't pay any attention, he might do and feel what the sword wanted him to do and feel.\nAfter looking at the second technique again, Shang practiced it a couple more times. The first technique had been rather easy for Shang to perform since he was familiar with the movements, but pulling off a feint was more difficult. After all, a feint had to seem convincing. If it weren't convincing, the opponent would be the one to gain the advantage.\nThe sword seemed to warm up to the technique after a couple more tries, and it became interested in it. Shang confirmed that he also felt like this.\nShang liked to end fights quickly, and creating an opening was basically the best way to end a fight. Additionally, the feint allowed Shang to unleash a big strike. Who didn't like using all their power in an attack?\nIt only took Shang a couple of minutes to become familiar with the technique, and he could pull it off without errors. However, in comparison to the first one, Shang would need to practice this technique several more times, and he would also need to test it in actual fights. Just because someone could do something perfectly in a calm setting didn't mean that they would be able to do the same thing perfectly in a hectic setting.\nThat was where practice came into play. Shang had to integrate this technique into his fighting style until he could use it without even thinking about it.\nFor now, Shang decided to put this technique into his daily training routine. It was worth the investment.\nShang looked at the next technique and repeated it a couple of times.\nThe sword was not fully happy with this technique, but it also wasn't fully against it. It sent feelings that perfectly reflected the words, \"meh, maybe.\"\nAfter unleashing the fourth technique, the sword became excited.\nIt absolutely loved that strike!\n'Makes sense,' Shang thought. 'It's a very aggressive attack that pushes my enemy back while also lowering my stance, allowing me to quickly explode forward after unleashing it. It's the very definition of aggressive.'\n'Am I such an aggressive person?' Shang thought.\n…\n'I don't know. Maybe? Not sure. Probably? Yeah, probably. Okay, definitely.'\nAs Shang went through his fights, he realized that he loved being the aggressive one. Sure, his fight with the Ice Spear Bear had been a very passive one, but that was simply because the bear had had a far more powerful body than him.\nIn every other fight, Shang had essentially been in a constant charge forward, unleashing attack after attack.\nShang practiced the fourth technique for quite a while. He didn't need to practice a lot since he was very familiar with these movements, but Shang simply wanted to practice it more. He just liked using it.\nShang went through more and more techniques, and soon, the sun began to dip below the walls. If Shang had decided to look outside, he would have seen a bright sky but no sun all around. That was definitely a sight one needed to get used to.\nUsually, even when one walked through a metropolis with gigantic buildings, at least some light rays would pass some of the buildings, leaving bright areas on the ground.\nBut here?\nNone of that.\nEven more, these bright spots in the cities often only came in the evening or morning when the sun was already near the horizon.\nBut right now, the sky was still a bright blue.\nWarrior's Paradise had a weird contrast. The sky was brightly lit like it were noon, but the streets were slightly darkened. It was a bit like someone turned down the contrast for everything inside the city while keeping the sky normal.\nSadly, Shang missed the first \"sunset\" of his new home since he had completely lost himself in training.\n\"Oh?\" Shang suddenly uttered as he unleashed a new technique.\nAt the same time, Shang felt some feelings of positive surprise coming from his sword.\n\"I like that one,\" Shang said. \"Usually, unleashing attacks that are only useful against humans feel weird since they mostly involve attacking something hard, but this one feels great.\"\nThis technique was a way to stop an opponent's attack, but it was also insanely aggressive.\nThe stance needed to perform this strike was a bit unnatural, and one wouldn't normally find themselves getting into such a stance during a fight, but with a bit of leading, one could get there.\nThe stance involved the sword hanging from the sword arm. The sword pointed towards the ground, and it could even slightly point behind the user in some cases.\nSuch a stance was unnatural since it left someone completely open.\nThe technique itself involved the user taking one step back with the more distant foot from the sword. While stepping back, the user would also put their second hand on the sword.\nAnd then, one would strike upward with the entire power of their body. Both legs, the hips, and the back would straighten at the same time, bundling all the power into the attack.\nThen, the user would unleash a single strike all the way from the bottom to the top.\nThe purpose of this technique wasn't to injure the opponent. After all, one would take a step back, which would result in one's torso also being pulled back a bit.\nThe purpose was to counter the opponent and break their guard.\nIf an opponent decided to unleash a strike from the top, this technique was perfect. By unleashing an attack from the top, the opponent could only unleash the power of their arms, their back, and the forward momentum of their legs. On top of that, they would probably only attack with one hand.\nMeanwhile, the one using the technique would explode forward with all their power. The weapons would clash with each other, but the one using the technique obviously had the upper hand in the exchange.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The opponent's weapon would be shot upward, and the opponent would be put before a difficult decision.\nLet go of the weapon or try to pull it back while it was trying to fly away.\nBoth outcomes would be positive for the user of the technique.\nShang loved the technique. It was a defensive technique, but it was also incredibly aggressive.\nFor the next hour, Shang only practiced this technique. He especially loved the sound the ground made when he used it. Since Shang was putting all of his power into an upward motion, the ground below him had to deal with the counterforce.\nEach action had an equal and opposite reaction.\nPhysics.\nAnd before Shang knew it, it had already become night.\nHowever, Shang didn't notice.\nHe had completely forgotten himself in his training.\nAll of these techniques were like a treasure trove, and he enjoyed practicing them.\nFor the first time, Shang had an actual, well-defined guide for practicing his swordsmanship.\nThese techniques were even better than he had expected!",

      "content": "Chapter 91 Numbers\nShang had no idea how long he had already been training, and he wasn't even thinking about it. He had completely let go of everything and only focused on training.\nWhen he got thirsty, he simply drank a bit from the bucket.\nWhen he became hungry, he simply took out some of the dried meat from his old backpack.\nThe training was also very draining on his stamina, but his stamina got quickly replenished by his Mana.\nWhen his Mana ran out, Shang simply sat down to gather some more. Refilling his Mana only took him like an hour or so.\nAs long as Shang didn't have any serious injuries or broken bones, his Mana refilled with a lot of speed. Apparently, healing fatigue and slightly torn muscles wasn't eating up even nearly as much Mana as an actual injury.\nAs Shang continued looking at every single technique and practicing them, he slowly began to feel mixed feelings.\nOn one hand, he wanted to incorporate all of the techniques. He was making great progress, and he would soon reach his goal of having completed all the basic techniques in the book.\nOn the other hand, Shang didn't want it to end. This book had increased his power greatly, and nearly all of Shang's movements had become more satisfying. It was like some imperfections had finally been solved.\nWhen Shang inevitably finished the book, he had no more techniques to analyze.\nEven more, the more Shang thought about it, the more ridiculous it seemed to him that these were all the techniques he was supposed to learn.\nSoran had said that students in the Caterpillar Class had no access to the actual techniques of the school. These students were supposed to create their own path and their own style. They were supposed to create their own complex techniques.\nAll of these were basic techniques and basic ways to move.\nHowever, all the techniques were disjointed, singular movements.\nThey weren't designed to flow into each other like an actual battle style.\nThe end of one technique might end in a slightly different spot than another good technique would need to be in to be unleashed.\nThis made everything feel disjointed and awkward.\nTraining the individual techniques on their own was great, but quickly switching between them felt horrible.\nThey simply didn't fit together.\n'I guess that's the purpose,' Shang thought as he awkwardly kept going from one technique into the next. He had already finished all of the techniques, and he was trying to get rid of the awkwardness.\nNearly all of Shang's attacks had been elevated, but the drawback was that his battle style was filled with the thing he hated the most.\nAwkward moments.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ It was like a video that skipped a couple of frames every two seconds or so.\nIt was infuriating, and Shang hated that feeling.\nHis previous training in the wilderness had completely focused on becoming faster and getting rid of these awkward moments. Shang wanted his techniques to flow perfectly, and he didn't want to have any downtime during a fight.\nHe wanted to attack and attack and attack and attack.\nHe wanted his attacks to never stop.\nAnd that had been possible in the past, but not anymore. Now, he had to deal with all these awkward moments of transition.\nIt sounded easy to simply alter the techniques a bit to make them start or end in a convenient place, but by doing that, the techniques themselves started to feel a bit awkward. After all, these techniques weren't supposed to be used from such a position.\nOn some occasions, they became slower.\nOn other occasions, they lost a lot of power.\nSometimes, they left Shang completely open.\nAfter practicing for who knew how long, Shang realized that this wouldn't be a short affair. Changing the techniques became harder and harder.\nIt was like he had, at some point, made an error in a Sudoku puzzle, which caused the entire puzzle to end up with wrong numbers everywhere that only came to light when the last two numbers became impossible combinations.\nThen, he would need to go back from the end and calculate everything again until he finally found a change he could make and continue from there, just to realize that he had made another mistake.\nIt was really difficult and frustrating.\nAt one point, Shang managed to make five techniques flow into each other just to realize that not a single other technique would be able to comfortably start from the endpoints of any of the previous five techniques.\nIt was a dead end.\nSo, he altered one of the techniques to make the sixth one fit, but that change resulted in the previously fitting technique no longer fitting, which meant he had to change that one, but this technique had been the connector that connected all the other techniques together, meaning that change destroyed everything else.\nIt was like Shang had to solve a colorless jigsaw puzzle with no border or corner pieces.\nHe simply had to start with a random one and try random pieces. However, not every outcropping of every piece was unique, which meant that some pieces that weren't supposed to be there fit into the outcropping regardless.\nIt was ridiculous.\nEven more, there were so many permutations to unleash all these different techniques that it didn't even make sense to write them all down. Sure, the changes one could do in a technique could only be so numerous until it stopped being that technique, but with every single technique having so many potential changes, the total number of combinations reached ridiculous levels.\n'How many possibilities even are there? That technique has like five possible changes. That one has three. That one has six. That one has four. That one also has five. That's 5x3x6x4x5…'\n'1800…'\n'1800 for five techniques…'\nShang glanced over at the book, which had about 50 techniques in it.\n'1800x5x2x4x7x5x3x4x8x3… I lost the number…'\n'I think the latest number was nearly at a billion, and how many techniques had that been? Like fourteen or fifteen.'\nFrom a number of five changes, the number went to nearly a billion in only fourteen steps or so…\nAnd there were over 30 left…\nHow many zeroes would that number have?\nSure, not every technique would flow into every other one, but even if Shang divided the final number by a thousand, it would still be a number far above anything even remotely practical.\nFor a while, Shang only looked at the book with techniques.\nRight now, Shang's feelings toward the book had changed.\nEarlier, he had loved it, but now, he wasn't so sure anymore.\nHe had already practiced all the relevant individual techniques several times, and he had already changed the way he was attacking.\nBut now, he was stuck with these awkward transitions between attacks.\n'Yeah, no,' Shang thought. 'I don't have time until the heat death of the universe sets in.'\nShang sighed.\n'I guess I can't get through this methodically or with brute force. I think I can only trust my feelings on this and slowly make progress. As long as I keep practicing repeatedly, I will eventually manage to combine several of them in a way that makes sense.'\nShang put his head in his hands as he looked at the book.\n'There are essentially infinite combinations in that book, and I'm pretty sure there are far more ways than one to combine all of them.'\n'I have to say that this book is insanely useful for students of the Caterpillar Class. We get a couple of techniques to give us a rough guideline on how to move in a fight, but the possible combinations are impossible to fathom.'\n'Sure enough, I'm forced to completely rely on my instinct, which is probably what they want. They want me to create my own style, after all.'\n'Anyway, I made quite good progress, and I managed to combine at least some of them. Brute-forcing like this would only have so much effect.'\n'Guess I should actually visit the lessons now.'\n'How late is it anyway?'",

He probably smelled horrible, and his old clothing was sticking to him, which was annoying.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Before today, he hadn't really bothered with how dirty his clothes felt since he hadn't had many alternatives, but now, he had.\nShang put his old clothes to the corner of the room and tilted the magic bucket.\nSure enough, as soon as he tilted it, a lot of water came out. It wasn't flowing incredibly fast, but there was quite a lot of water.\nShang had taken baths before in this world but never a real shower. Back on Earth, he had exclusively showered since it was faster and since he loved the feeling of cold water running down his body.\nIt felt a bit weird to have no soap available, but he had to learn to live with that.\nAfter Shang was done with the shower, he looked at his hair. He contemplated cutting it, but he had only been here for half a year. Right now, his hair was a bit too long for his liking, but it wasn't overly bad.\nThen, Shang touched his face to feel his beard.\nSure enough, the growth of his beard could, at best, be called spread out. Additionally, he had that typical teenage mustache with these thin hairs.\nShang took his sword and tried to shave, the keyword being tried.\nThe sword just didn't want to cut him.\n\"Come on. I only want to cut off some hairs,\" Shang said to his sword.\nHis sword didn't react.\n\"Come on. Just become sharp,\" Shang said, lightly tapping his arm with his sword.\nShang only felt feelings of confusion coming from the sword.\nFor the next couple of minutes, Shang tried to communicate with his sword, but he only received confusing or angry feelings. The sword either had no idea what he wanted, or it became annoyed at Shang needlessly slapping it against his body.\nIn the end, Shang gave up with a groan. Its mind simply wasn't powerful enough to communicate with him effectively. Just like a newborn, the best the sword could do was to show some vague signals about how it was feeling right now.\n\"I need a knife to shave,\" Shang said after giving up. \"I can deal with long hair, but I don't like this stupid, tiny beard. It makes me look like a child.\"\n\"I should look around the school now. Maybe I can buy a knife with gold, and while I'm at it, I can also get to know the surroundings.\"\nShang went over to his uniforms and was about to pick up the green uniform.\nBut then, he stopped.\n\"Eh, green,\" Shang commented with a frown. \"I'm not really a green kinda guy.\"\nSo, Shang went over to the bronze uniform and put it on. The azure uniform could only be worn on special occasions.\n\"Finally, some clothes that don't feel dirty as fuck,\" Shang said after putting on his uniform, \"but they sure are heavy.\"\nShang jumped around a bit to get a feel for the weight. No real armor was visible from the outside when looking at the uniform, but it also definitely didn't feel light. There was also no metal inside the uniform anywhere.\nSo, the weight had to come from the fabric itself, which felt weird to Shang. What fabric was this heavy?\nLuckily, Shang's body had long gone above anything possible on Earth. Shang could break a huge number of world records without even trying really hard.\nOn Earth, wearing such a heavy uniform was definitely very uncomfortable for long periods, but here, it was only a matter of time until he got used to it.\nTo Shang, it felt no different from putting on a normal jacket. He felt the weight, but he could ignore it after a while.\n\"Huh, socks,\" Shang said as he saw the socks. \"Been a while since I've worn those.\"\n\"And actual shoes, wow.\"\nShang looked to the side of the uniform and saw a couple of rings made of fabric hanging from the uniform. \"I guess that's for my weapon. Sadly, my sword's too long to carry at the waist.\"\nDue to the unique look of Shang's sword, he had to carry it differently. Usually, one-handed swords were supposed to be worn at the side since that would give quick and easy access.\nHowever, since his sword was too long, it had to be put on Shang's back like a two-handed sword.\nSadly, that looked a bit ridiculous. Yes, Shang's sword was about as long as a two-handed sword, but it was far too thin for one. That made the sword on his back look a bit out of place.\nShang looked out of the little slit that was his window, but he couldn't really tell how late it was. He saw the light coming through it, but that was it.\nThen, Shang left his room for the first time in quite a while.\nShang saw no one in the hallway, but he heard the sounds of training and fighting from outside. He went over to the stairs and walked down to the first floor, which he then exited.\nNow, for the first time, Shang could really look at the academy while it was busy.\nThere were several training fields at the sides of the academy. The fields weren't separated by fences but lines. There was basically no flora in the academy, and there were only a couple of beasts. However, these beasts were inside special arenas, and they were all fighting some students.\nShang's attention was drawn to the beasts since he hadn't seen a lot of them before.\nThere were a couple of lizards, badgers, snakes, and there was even a bear. Shang could also see a couple of flying beasts, but they were on the rare side.\nThe students were of all ages, but they were always grouped into similar age groups. Most of the groups had a teacher overseeing them, but not all of them had one. Shang guessed that the groups without a teacher were not taking part in a lesson but just training regularly.\nAll in all, Shang guessed that there were over a thousand students on the fields, quite a lot.\nSuddenly, out of Shang's peripheral vision, he saw a hand come toward his right shoulder.\nPACK!\nOut of reflex, Shang shoved the hand to the side with his right arm. He hadn't even thought about his actions before he had done so since his long training on Earth had conditioned him to block hands coming for him unexpectedly.\n\"Huh?\" Shang heard as he looked to the owner of the hand.\nIt was a blonde guy with a long halberd on his back. Judging by his height and face, he was probably around 17 years old. At the moment, he was looking with surprise at Shang.\nShang looked at the guy with furrowed brows.\nAfter a second, the guy only snorted humorously. \"Not bad, kid, but move out of the way now.\"\nShang was blocking half of the entrance of the building, but instead of going to the side, the guy had intended to shove Shang to the side. The shove hadn't been very strong, but it had still very clearly shown the guy's intention.\nWithout even waiting for Shang to move to the side after he said his phrase, the guy moved his hand with a lot more speed towards Shang's shoulder to shove him to the side.\nApparently, his pride had been hurt by Shang blocking his hand.\nShang only narrowed his eyes as he looked at the guy.",

      "content": "Chapter 93 Stars Gerbon\nPACK!\nShang easily shoved the hand to the side again, making it miss his shoulder.\nFor a moment, the two of them only looked at each other.\nThen, Shang walked to the side, making room for the blonde guy. Without saying anything, Shang simply gestured to the free door.\nFor a bit, the blonde guy looked at Shang with furrowed brows. On one hand, he could pass now, but on the other hand, Shang had shoved his hand to the side.\nThe guy definitely didn't like that a mere kid was looking at him like that.\n\"Tch, don't do something like that again if you want to survive in the academy,\" the guy spat before he entered the building.\nShang didn't answer, and his eyes didn't follow the guy.\nWith his actions, Shang had shown that he was willing to comply but also that he wouldn't accept being mistreated.\nShang had shown that it was a bad idea to pick a fight with him, but he had also not provoked the other person. He hadn't insulted him or berated him. He had only dealt with the action that went too far without teaching the other side \"a lesson\".\nCould Shang have verbally attacked the guy after his little verbal provocation?\nSure, but why should he?\nIt was simply someone that wanted to save some face after receiving a perceived loss.\nMany times, when someone felt like they were losing a confrontation or a discussion, they tried to get one last jab in before leaving. Something like that was a bit cowardly, and one could certainly start the entire confrontation again based on that last jab. However, Shang had better things to do than to argue with some random guy.\nMany people in Shang's place would have thrown a jab back. After all, he had been verbally attacked, so he had the right to attack back.\nBut that wasn't Shang.\nWhy?\nBecause it was pointless.\nIt was a waste of time.\nWhat was the point of beating down some random guy? Would Shang get fighting experience?\nNo.\nWould Shang get money?\nNo.\nWould Shang get training?\nNo.\nSo why should he do it?\nJust because it felt good?\nBecause it felt good to stand above someone else?\nSure, but here's the kicker.\nThat feeling is only something someone without much self-confidence needed.\nShang's self-confidence didn't come from beating up some random kid that insulted him but from his actual power.\nAfter the guy entered the building, Shang walked forward, leaving the building behind.\nSounds of fighting and screaming filled the area, and Shang got reminded of his old MMA gym. It hadn't been this crowded and loud, but the feeling was very similar.\nShang followed the paved road for a bit until he reached a crossroads. The rulebook had included a map of the academy, and Shang knew where each road led.\nThe western road led to the main building.\nThe eastern road led to the city.\nThe southern road led to an area dedicated to trading. It included the exchange hall for Contribution Points and a market with plenty of useful wares for warriors. Of course, the market only accepted gold.\nThe northern road led to the most training fields and arenas. Sure, the fields and arenas were basically everywhere strewn around the academy, but the biggest of them were in the north.\nSince Shang was interested in purchasing a knife, he went towards the south, to the market.\n\"You seem pretty strong.\"\nShang couldn't take more than a couple of steps before someone stopped him from the side.\n\"Is there something you need?\" Shang asked neutrally.\nThe person that had stopped Shang was someone at his age, 14 or 15 probably. He had icy blue hair, and Shang could feel a bit of Ice Mana swirling around him. On his waist, he carried two long rapiers.\nShang had the habit of analyzing everyone around him and thinking about how they would fight, and this boy wasn't an exception.\nShang guessed that this boy wasn't a pure warrior but a Magic Warrior, someone that practiced Magic to enhance their physical fighting capabilities. With his two rapiers, he was probably someone that struck quickly and with precision.\nHowever, for some reason, Shang felt like the boy in front of him was weak.\nEverything about him, his equipment, his long hair, his two shining weapons, and his radiant uniform made him appear like a genius.\nYet, Shang felt like the boy was only putting on an act.\nTo Shang, he felt very weak.\nThe boy smiled with confidence, his smile brightening up the surroundings. \"I've seen how you dealt with one of the upperclassmen, and I think we two can be useful to each other.\"\n\"Useful? In what way?\" Shang asked neutrally.\n\"Well, you see, I'm Stars Gerbon from the Gerbon National Resource Trading Firm,\" the boy, Stars, said with a graceful tone. \"I've recently joined the famous Warrior's Academy, and I'm planning on creating a group of like-minded individuals.\"\n\"Not interested,\" Shang said directly.\nStars looked with shock at Shang for a second. Then, he put on a bitter smile. \"Excuse me, have you heard of the Gerbon National Res-\"\n\"No,\" Shang answered, interrupting him. He didn't want to listen to that annoyingly long name again.\nStars' left eyelid twitched a bit, but he still kept up his polite smile. \"Well, you see, the Gerbon Nat-\"\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Shang said, interrupting the boy again. \"Your background doesn't matter in here, and as I've said, I'm not interested.\"\nThen, Shang continued walking.\nAfter Shang said that, the polite smile vanished from Stars, and an icy expression came over his face.\n\"Are you sure you want to do this?\" he asked slowly.\nShang stopped walking and slowly turned around. Then, he looked into Stars' eyes. \"Since you've been polite up to now, I'm willing to give you an honestly well-meant hint. This is not some veiled insult, or something said to provoke a reaction from you. It's an actual piece of advice.\"\nStars only lifted an eyebrow.\n\"Your act only works on warriors that haven't been through enough life-threatening situations in their lives,\" Shang said. \"You can fool those warriors, but those warriors are worthless to begin with. In this world, four hands can't beat two fists.\"\n\"Give up,\" Shang said. \"Give up trying to create a power. You obviously haven't been in danger in your life, and an experienced warrior can see that. Don't try to get around the pain of training by using your political ability to create some form of power. You're too weak for such an undertaking.\"\n\"Go back to training.\"\nStars' eyes narrowed, and Shang could not only see anger but actual hatred inside them.\nObviously, Shang had hit a nerve with his words. Based on that look, Stars had probably heard exactly these words a couple of times before in his life. Otherwise, he wouldn't have had such a strong emotional reaction.\nShang guessed that Stars' parents had probably said something similar.\nSo, how did Stars react?\nHe sighed, turned around, and left.\nA couple of seconds after Stars left, Shang sighed.\n'Me and my big mouth. I wanted to give him some honest advice but see where that got me. I'm pretty sure that guy is going to send his goons at me later for my perceived disrespectful behavior.'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang continued walking to the south while scratching his chin.\n'Honestly, I don't want to deal with every annoying guy individually. I think I should make an example out of the first group.'",

      "content": "Chapter 94 Market\nShang reached the market after a bit of walking. Sure enough, there were plenty of stalls here. Some of the stall owners were trying to attract customers by shouting out what great prices they had, but some didn't shout anything.\nShang walked around the market for a bit under the constant barrage of offers. He didn't really listen to all the shouts since no one was shouting about knives.\nBut then, Shang suddenly halted and turned in a different direction. He had just heard something interesting.\nShang had thought that he was immune to the devious powers of marketing. Sadly, he had been mistaken.\n\"You said you have Rank Two ore?\" Shang asked the smiling merchant.\n\"Of course! Only the finest ores at Willie's Five Finger Emporium!\" the merchant said with a wide grin.\n\"I'm interested,\" Shang asked. \"Could you show me what you have to offer?\"\n\"Sure thing!\" the merchant said as he took out eight different pieces of ore. Obviously, these pieces weren't everything he had to offer, and they only were for display purposes.\nShang looked at the eight pieces of ore.\n\"We have more to offer, but I only brought out the best for you!\" the merchant said with a wide smile. \"These are our finest Rank Two ores, seven for all the different Affinities and one for warriors that decided to take on a purer path.\"\nShang nodded as he looked at the eight stones. \"Can I touch them?\"\n\"Sure thing!\" the merchant shouted as he pushed the stones forward.\nShang took each stone into his hand one by one and acted like he was inspecting their quality.\nIn truth, he had no idea about ore.\nHe was actually just feeling the reaction of his sword.\nWhenever Shang took hold of a stone, his sword would vibrate, and Shang could feel excitement and hunger coming from it.\nThe sword's reaction to the stones was the same for all of them. Apparently, there wasn't anything special about them. They were all equally interesting to it.\nShang had wanted to test if his sword preferred materials from a specific Affinity, but it didn't. Everything was the same to it.\n\"How much for the Earth Affinity one?\" Shang asked.\n\"How much do you need? Our prices depend on how much you purchase,\" the merchant answered.\n\"Enough to completely reforge this sword,\" Shang said, slightly rotating so that the merchant could see the sword on Shang's back. Pulling out the weapon was forbidden, so Shang had to show his sword this way.\nThe merchant looked at the sword and nodded with a wide grin. \"You're in luck! That should be just enough to qualify for our lowest bulk purchase discount!\"\n\"How much?\" Shang asked.\n\"To reforge your entire sword, you need around seven units of ore, which would come to 150 gold, but with the bulk purchase discount, it's only 140 gold!\" the merchant said.\nShang nodded. \"What about the Ice Affinity one?\"\n\"The Ice Affinity is much rarer than Earth Affinity, so it's slightly more expensive. The same amount of the Ice Affinity one comes to 200 gold naturally, but 190 gold for you,\" the merchant answered.\nShang nodded. \"What about the one without Affinity?\"\n\"That's our cheapest one, and it only costs 100 gold. Sadly, since they are in higher demand, we can't offer you a bulk purchase discount,\" the merchant said.\nShang nodded again. \"Thank you for your time. However, at the moment, I lack the funds to purchase any of your wares. I'm very interested in them, but, just for the moment, I have to decline. When I have the necessary funds, I will come back to take a closer look, assuming I don't find a better offer in the meantime.\"\nThe merchant deflated, but he didn't lose his smile or professionalism. \"That's okay! You can find me here Monday to Wednesday. I wish you luck in acquiring the funds you need!\"\nShang nodded and said his goodbyes.\n'So, that's the tradeoff, huh?' Shang thought as he continued looking for a knife. 'The selection of wares here is more than broad. From what I can tell, there is stuff from all around the world here. The students can find everything they will ever need in this marketplace.'\n'However, in return, the prices are ridiculous,' Shang thought. 'That one guy I met in one of the towns on the way to Warrior's Paradise offered me ore of similar quality for only 40 gold. Sadly, he had only one kind of Rank Two ore for sale, and there hadn't been another merchant that sold Rank Two ore.'\n'And I can't blame them. If I were them, I also wouldn't sell it locally but in a vast and rich city like Warrior's Paradise. Most students come from prestigious backgrounds, and they're not lacking any money. The merchants can sell their wares without competing in prices in the academy.'\n'If I want to upgrade my sword, I need to get some gold. Additionally, I should ask one of the teachers where the ore is sourced. Maybe I can get it cheaper by traveling there.'\nAfter walking around the marketplace for a while, Shang found a stall that sold knives.\nIt was a hunting store, and the knives they sold were for skinning beasts. Oftentimes, hunters didn't go into the Wild Forest just to hunt one single beast. Most of the time, they went in there for the entire day, killing everything they could find and were allowed to kill.\nBeast meat could be sold for quite a lot of money, but the ratio of gold to volume and weight was far lower than things like teeth, fur, and claws. Not many people had Space Rings, which meant that they had to carry their prey with beast sacks.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ If they carried the entire corpse, they would need to return to Warrior's Paradise immediately since they simply couldn't carry more. Because of that, most of these kinds of hunters simply removed the most valuable things of their prey and left the meat and bone in the wild.\nThat also had the positive side-effect of increasing the beast population again. After all, the corpses would quickly be consumed by the wildlife there.\nShang purchased a skinning knife suitable for all beasts in the First Realm for two gold. There were no shaving knives on the market since every warrior in the academy simply used their weapons to shave. Of course, a lot of them simply didn't shave at all.\nAfter getting the knife, Shang also went to the Exchange Hall, the place where students could exchange their wares for Contribution Points and vice versa.\nShang asked the clerk to check his balance, and the clerk said that Shang had 20 Contribution Points on his account. Apparently, 20 Contribution Points was how much the full corpse of a Pest Cat was worth.\nShang knew that attending a normal lesson gave a student one Contribution Point while attending a core lesson gave them two Contribution Points. Core lessons were the class-specific lessons for whichever class the student was in.\n'One Pest Cat is worth ten core lessons or 20 normal lessons. That's not much but also not little. On one hand, someone needs to study for basically an entire week to get that many Contribution Points, but on the other hand, someone doesn't have to put themselves into danger for only one week.'\n'I guess it depends on the power of the student how they view the situation.'\nShang also checked up on the prices of the ore in the Exchange Hall.\nThe cheapest Rank Two ore was 2,000 Contribution Points for one unit of ore. As the merchant had suggested earlier, Shang would need seven units for his sword, which would come to 14,000 Contribution Points.\nThat sounded like a lot, but it actually wasn't.\nJust by studying, a student wouldn't be able to get that easily, but that wasn't an issue. There were enough beasts and missions for everyone. Additionally, Shang's sword was rather big since it was so long. It wasn't as big as a true two-handed sword, but it was definitely very big for a one-handed sword. Other students probably wouldn't need as many Contribution Points.\nBefore Shang left the Exchange Hall, he also looked at the mission board inside it. The mission boards were all over the academy, and they all showed different missions.\nThe one in the Exchange Hall listed transportation and escort missions.\nThe one that gave the least rewards already gave ten Contribution Points, and the mission was only to get something from Blizzard's Edge. That wasn't even a full day of travel for Shang.\nThe more lucrative ones gave hundreds and even thousands of Contribution Points. Of course, the really good ones were locked to warriors on the General Stage.\nAfter looking at the missions for a while, Shang left the Exchange Hall. He wanted to get back to his room, shave, and then take part in some lessons.\nSadly, on his way back to the main building, what he had anticipated would come, had come.\nFour students at Shang's age were looking at him with crossed arms.\nStars Gerbon stood between them.",

      "content": "Chapter 95 Older Student\nShang looked at the four people plus Stars with an even expression. He had seen this situation coming from a mile away.\n'Fucking kids. Every time something doesn't go their way, they have to try to change something instead of realizing that, sometimes, the best way is to simply accept their current situation,' Shang thought with annoyance.\nShang sighed and walked toward the building, which meant that he was effectively walking toward the group.\nShang had seen how the group had let others pass through without any issues, but sure enough, as soon as Shang arrived near them, they stopped before him.\nInstead of looking at the group of goons, Shang looked at Stars with a bored expression. \"Is this what you decided to be the best course of action?\" he asked.\nStars definitely didn't like Shang's lack of fear or respect. Didn't that guy know that he was surrounded by four students of the Warrior's Academy? Every single student had great potential, and there were no weak ones. Being surrounded by four warriors outside might not be that bad, but in this school, it was bad.\nNone of these four students was weak.\n\"This wasn't my choice, but yours,\" Stars said with a helpless sigh. \"If you hadn't tried to disrespect me, I would have simply let you go, you know?\"\n\"Do you not realize where we are?\" Stars asked helplessly as he slowly shook his head. \"This is the Warrior's Academy. You can't afford to be disrespectful to others, or you will find yourself at the end of a blade. If you want to make it here, you have to defend your honor if someone disrespects you.\"\n\"You gave me no other choice.\"\nIt wasn't hard for Shang to see through that bullshit.\nOne had to defend one's honor?\nNo?\nIt wasn't hard to just walk away. As long as someone didn't physically attack someone else, it wasn't necessary to start a fight. They couldn't even fight with their weapons, which meant that they wouldn't even get any fighting experience with their weapon.\nOn top of that, Contribution Points couldn't even be transferred between students. That rule existed to stop the top few students from cannibalizing the bottom 90%. Sure, the academy didn't have anything against students fighting against each other, but they didn't want 90% of the students to be essentially crippled.\nIn short, there was literally no point in them fighting. No one would benefit.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ It was simply kids doing kids' stuff.\nShang looked away from Stars and looked at the four people who had surrounded him by now.\nIf this were Earth, Shang would have long fled. Fighting four trained fighters was impossible, even for the best fighter on Earth. A human only had a limited number of arms, and they didn't have eyes on the back of their heads.\nIn movies, it was normal for one guy to beat up like ten people, but in real life, it didn't work like that. If one looked closely, one would always notice that the actor in the movie never got attacked by every enemy at once. They always came in small waves.\nIn real life, it didn't work that way. On Earth, Shang could have punched away maybe one or two guys if he was faster and more powerful than them, but while punching the first two away, the other two would have already hit Shang on the back of his head.\nThen what?\nHis consciousness would be shaken, and the four would throw him to the ground and kick him.\nAt that point, it would already be over.\nHowever, this wasn't Earth.\nIn this world, Shang didn't need to fear numbers as long as they didn't reach ridiculous heights.\nThe four students around Shang were 14 or 15, except for one person, who looked slightly older. Shang guessed that the last guy was probably 17 or 18.\nSo, at what Stage were the students surrounding Shang?\nThree were at the Early Soldier Stage, and the older one was at the Middle Soldier Stage.\nShang was at the Peak Soldier Stage.\nThis was a gigantic difference.\nThere were five levels in each Realm.\nInitial, Early, Middle, Late, Peak.\nSo, if described with levels and numbers, Shang's opponents would be level two, two, two, and three, while Shang was level five.\nWhat did that mean in terms of fighting capability?\nThis meant that Shang outclassed every single one of his opponents by a factor of three, at least.\nIf put into perspective, it was like an adult male being besieged by four ten-year-olds.\nBecause of that, Shang wasn't even nervous. He simply waited for them to make their move.\nWhen Stars saw that Shang didn't answer, he became annoyed.\n\"This is the one?\" the oldest of the group asked Stars. Surprisingly, his voice didn't sound too happy.\nShang looked at the oldest of the group when he spoke, and the oldest looked back. However, Shang noticed a subtle reaction.\nHe was afraid.\n'Sure enough, he noticed my power,' Shang thought. 'Based on what I've heard, the latest entrance exams have been like two or three months ago, and these guys are definitely amongst the youngest. That means that they most likely joined the Warrior's Academy with the latest batch.'\n'But the older guy has been here for at least two additional years, probably more. It would be unforgivable if a student that had been in the Warrior's Academy for so long didn't have the ability to roughly estimate an opponent's power.'\n\"Yes, this is the one,\" Stars said with a polite smile. When he talked to Shang, he acted like a sneaky serpent, but when he talked to his underlings, he was polite.\n\"And you want us to beat him up,\" the oldest of the group asked for confirmation.\n\"Sadly, I have no other choice,\" Stars said with a sigh. \"If we want our group to grow, we have to show that nobody can mess with us.\"\nWhen the oldest of the group heard that, he grimaced.\nThen, he looked at Shang, who looked back neutrally.\nThe oldest gritted his teeth. It was like he was making a very important decision.\nThe others were waiting for the oldest student's signal. He was their squad leader, and he had to give the order first.\nThe oldest student took off one of his rings with anger.\nSHING!\nSeveral different items appeared in front of the older student, as well as a ton of gold.\nStars and everyone around him looked with surprise at the oldest student. What was he doing?\nThe student took a huge sack of gold, put it in the Space Ring, and then…\nClink!\nHe threw it at the ground in front of Stars. Space Rings were very durable as long as someone didn't put the wrong stuff into them. After all, they had to hold even in fights.\nStars looked with shock at the Space Ring in front of his feet.\n\"Take your gold and your Space Ring back,\" the oldest student said. \"I'm leaving.\"\nStars and his lackeys only looked with shock at the student.\nMeanwhile, the student grabbed his belongings and looked at Shang with a serious expression. \"I'm sorry for standing in your way,\" he said solemnly.\nShang nodded. \"It's fine. We all make mistakes. At least you managed to rectify yours before it became too late.\"\nThe student nodded and smiled a bit. \"Thank you.\"\nThen, the student looked at his former members. \"If I were you, I would quickly leave,\" he said.\nLastly, the student quickly packed his stuff and entered the building. He probably wanted to put his stuff away first before doing anything else.\nShang threw a glance after the student and looked at the Space Ring in Stars' hand. 'A Space Ring and a huge sack of gold. Even I'm interested.'\n'Sadly, it's forbidden to steal inside the academy.'",

      "content": "Chapter 96 Intimidation\nStars didn't know how to react. His strongest member had left just like that.\nWhy?\nSo what if that guy was strong? They were five! Why did he leave?!\nOn top of that, this guy was their age! How powerful could his body possibly be? Even if he somehow managed to get a body in the Middle Soldier Stage, the older student had several years of battle experience on him.\n\"And what will you do now?\" Shang asked.\nStars turned to Shang when he spoke, but he noticed that Shang wasn't talking to him but to the other three students.\n\"Someone more powerful and more experienced than you realized that it's not a good idea to attack me. Will you mindlessly follow your leader's orders, or will you make the sensible decision and leave?\"\n\"Don't listen to his empty words!\" Stars shouted with a furious expression. His polite and civil demeanor had completely vanished as he realized that Shang was threatening the group of people he had built up with so much work.\n\"Jarem was a coward! We were five people, and he's several years older than him! So what if this guy is strong?! We are four! He is one! How strong can he be?! He's just as old as us!\" Stars shouted.\nThe other three students were no longer calm. They had no idea what they should do now. They didn't have the experience or instincts to feel another human's power! They were simply new students from middle-ranked families! They didn't know how powerful their opponent was!\nTwo conflicting streams of logic collided in their minds.\nTheir squad leader had given up without a fight, which meant that this guy had to be really powerful.\nHowever, he was also only 14 and 15. So, how powerful could he possibly be?\nThese were the two thoughts that collided with each other.\nWhich one was right?\nThey had no idea!\nMeanwhile, several other students had stopped at the side. They had noticed that something interesting was going on, and they came to watch.\nThe more experienced one of the students felt Shang's power and became shocked. Someone that young had such a powerful body?! How was that even possible?! Did he come from some high-ranking noble family!?\nBut when they overcame their shock, they only grinned.\nOh, this was going to be good.\nStars noticed all the students stop around them to watch. As Stars saw all the eyes watching, his anxiety shot through the roof.\nHe couldn't humiliate himself in front of so many students!\nHe felt like the entire academy was watching! Stars had already begun to suspect that going against Shang might not have been the smartest idea, but he couldn't back down now. If he retreated now after putting on such a grand act, he wouldn't be able to look anyone in the eyes anymore.\nHe had to go through with it to the end! At worst, he would have to receive a slight beating. His family name would protect him from the worst, at least.\nStars turned to Shang again with gritted teeth. Then, he looked at his lackeys. \"Don't forget, you signed a contract. Jarem didn't. You can't disobey a reasonable order,\" he said with a threatening tone.\nUsually, Stars would have never threatened his underlings. After all, it was important that one's underlings liked the leader. If they didn't, lots of problems would occur.\nHowever, Stars had no other choice! His underlings were already starting to hesitate. He had to push them forward!\nWhen the three heard Stars' words, they grimaced.\nHe was right.\nIf they broke the contract, they would have to pay back everything they had received from Stars. Compared to Jarem, these three had joined Stars way earlier, which meant that they had already spent a lot of their wealth.\nPaying everything back now would be nearly impossible! Even if they sold the wares they had purchased again, they wouldn't get the full price, and they would need to work their asses off for months.\nThey were only Early Soldier Stage warriors. There weren't many options to make a ton of money for them. They couldn't even kill Pest Cats!\nIn the end, the three of them gritted their teeth and looked at Shang helplessly.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ They had decided that they would sacrifice their health today. Being beaten up was better than having to work for months.\nWhen Shang saw their expressions, he narrowed his eyes. \"I don't care if you are under orders. You are free to disobey said orders. If you attack me, I will treat you like an enemy,\" he said coldly.\nThe bodies of the three students shook, but they could only grit their teeth. Yes, they could decide to disobey the order, but the cost would be far too high!\nBy now, the three of them had realized that they probably had zero chance against Shang. If even their squad leader, whom they couldn't win against three on one, had left, they had no chance.\nBecause of that, it didn't matter how they fought. As long as they fought, they would be complying with the orders.\nOne of the three students gritted his teeth and readied a punch.\nThen, he threw his punch at Shang.\nPack!\nShang caught the arm with narrowed eyes.\nHe had already planned to make an example of this group of students. The academy had several Water Mages, which meant that the students wouldn't die as long as Shang didn't kill them instantly.\nToday, he would make sure that no one else would bother him.\nShang grabbed the forearm of the student with his full power, breaking the radius and the ulna, the two bones in the forearm.\nThe sound of bones breaking and the splinters digging through flesh rung throughout the courtyard as the face of the student widened in pain and horror.\nThen, Shang grabbed the student's hand with his other arm and pulled.\nRRRRIIIP!\nShang ripped the hand out of the forearm and threw it at the wall, breaking it into multiple bloody pieces.\nThe onlookers took a deep breath through their teeth.\nBANG!\nLastly, Shang kicked the student.\nBANG!\nThe student hit the wall of the main building with a resounding impact. More sounds of breaking bones could be heard in the courtyard.\nWhen the student hit the ground, he didn't scream. Instead, he started convulsing as his body spasmed in place, thick bloody gurgling out of his mouth. He tried to breathe, but only blood entered his lungs, which then gurgled out again.\nBy now, the courtyard was dead silent.\nThe younger students were used to fighting with each other, but in a way, most of the fighting students were still teenagers.\nPunching someone else and kicking them was normal. Getting bruised or one or two bones broken was also normal.\nBut this…\nThis was not normal for them.\nThis student was legitimately dying!\nHe was suffocating on his own blood!\nMeanwhile, Shang looked with narrowed eyes at the other two students. \"Move,\" he said coldly.\nThe other two students were frozen in terror. They had expected to be beaten up, but they hadn't expected that!\nThis was not normal!\nThis was not just a beating!\nWhen they heard Shang's words, they very quickly jumped to the side. Their contract was long forgotten. Their fear was simply too powerful.\nShang walked over to Stars with narrowed eyes.\nStars was still looking at the dying student with terror, and he didn't notice Shang approach. When he did, it was already too late.\nStars' body froze in terror when he saw Shang's eyes directly in front of his own. \"M-My family is ah-\"\nBefore Stars could finish his sentence, Shang shoved his right hand into his mouth, taking hold of his jaw.\nStars' eyes widened in absolute terror.\nNo!\nRRRIIIIIIP!\nShang tore his jaw off.\nThe younger students gasped in horror.\nOf course, there were still several students that watched everything with calm eyes. They had also killed humans before, and they knew that these two students wouldn't die.\nYes, Shang had been rather brutal, but as long as he didn't kill them, he was allowed to do that.\nStars began to scream incoherent nonsense as he writhed on the ground.\nBANG!\nShang squashed the jaw in his hand and threw the ball of gore on the ground beside Stars.\n\"Don't annoy me again,\" he said before he walked into the building.\nFrom the side, one of the teachers sighed and picked the two students up.\nHe was used to bringing injured students to the Water Mage.\n'But really, that guy was a bit too cruel. Regrowing something is many times more expensive than simply reattaching something. Did he really have to destroy that arm and jaw?'\n'Well, I don't have to pay it.'",

      "content": "Chapter 97 Guilt\nShang closed the door behind him after entering his room. Then, he just stood there in the mostly dark room. The small slit didn't let much light through.\nSilence.\nShang just waited in silence.\nAt the moment, Shang's heart was beating rapidly as sweat ran down his body. A deep feeling of guilt was inside his heart.\nHe had acted coldhearted and brutal, but that didn't reflect the truth.\nThis was the first time after that fateful night that Shang had injured another person to such an extent.\nPunching someone, breaking an arm, or similar things were still relatively normal to Shang. After all, he had been a fighter in his past life, and it was normal for fighters to get injured in a fight.\nHowever, what he had done out there was not normal for a fighter.\nShang might be in the body of a 15-year-old, but in his mind, he still viewed himself as a 23-year-old. So, when he looked at the other students, Shang didn't see people of his age but kids.\nThey were children.\nAdditionally, what would they have done to him? At most, they would have broken one or two bones and would have given him some bruises.\nShang had seen the ill-intent in their eyes, but Shang hadn't felt true maliciousness coming from them. They only wanted to beat him down to show their superiority.\nThey were just kids.\nYet, Shang had done horrible things to them. One of them had been close to death, while the other one went through unimaginable pain.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang had his reasons for acting this brutally, but it was still difficult.\nOn Earth, Shang would have gone to prison for his actions.\nYes, they had attacked him, and Shang had the right to defend himself, but that was it, defend.\nRegarding the first guy, breaking his arm and kicking him would have been enough. Shang's action of tearing his arm off had gone beyond mere defense.\nHowever, the worse offense was with Stars.\nStars hadn't even tried to attack Shang. Yes, he had given the order, but he had never shown any intention of attacking Shang.\nShang could have simply beaten him down, thrown him away, or immobilized him.\nTearing out someone's jaw was not considered self-defense.\n'I've done the right thing,' Shang thought as he took a deep breath. 'With that display, fewer people will bother me in the future, and I won't have to do something like that again. The other students saw what happens when they try to attack me, and they won't try something like that again.'\n'My actions were right. It was the right decision.'\nAbsentmindedly, Shang took the skinning knife he had bought and began to shave his beard.\n'I made the correct choice,' he repeated to himself in his mind.\nAs the rhythmic strokes of the knife continued, Shang continued to repeat the same words to himself in his mind.\nShang didn't know how long he had been shaving, but when he felt something wet on his right hand, he stopped.\nHe looked over and saw blood dripping down from the knife.\nShang touched his jaw, but it had already fully healed.\nHe hadn't even noticed that he had cut himself while shaving, and judging by the amount of blood, it hadn't been little.\n'It's a skinning knife. It's only logical that it cuts my skin while shaving. I should be more careful in the future,' Shang thought before washing the knife and leaving it in his room.\nShang also washed his hands before leaving the room again.\nShang came out of the building and looked at the surroundings.\nThe blood from earlier was gone, and the students were back to doing whatever they were doing.\nNot many people were looking at Shang, and the few that did either averted their gazes quickly or lost interest.\nIt was like nothing had happened.\nWhen Shang saw that, he realized once again that he was truly in a different world. If something like that had happened on Earth, the people would still be crowded around the area where it had happened while police were investigating the place.\nIn this world, it was normal.\nShang looked at the big clock above the main entrance to the main building. Usually, warriors didn't really care about the time of the day. They mostly focused on the position of the sun to judge time.\nHowever, Mages had introduced a more accurate measure of time, which were clocks. Mages were often very busy, and they couldn't just schedule things based on the position of the sun.\nFor example, they could have two meetings in the afternoon.\nWhich one should they go to first? Additionally, the definition of afternoon was different from person to person.\nBecause of that, Mages used clocks while warriors used the position of the sun normally, but since this academy was very sophisticated and also included plenty of education about Mages, it had adopted the clock.\nThere was also the name of the weekday beside the clock. The academy knew that warriors often forgot the time while they were fully focused on training.\n'I'm lucky. The core lesson for the Caterpillar Class will start soon. I've been stuck on the techniques, and I need some feedback from one of the teachers.'\nShang walked towards the north, towards the bigger training fields. The core lesson for the Caterpillar Class took place there.\nAfter walking for a bit, Shang saw several different training fields and arenas. Fortunately, there were signs beside each training field, and Shang quickly found a sign with a caterpillar on it.\nThe training field had a couple of older students standing on it. There were probably around 20 students between the ages of 17 and 19. Most of them were talking in groups while a couple of them swung their weapons around as warmup.\nThe students were allowed to draw their weapons on a training field, but they were forbidden from threatening others. If they wanted to mess with another student, they had to put their weapon away again.\nWhen Shang stepped onto the training field, a couple of students looked at him.\nSome of them furrowed their brows. Some of them looked with skepticism at Shang. Some narrowed their eyes, and some of them even smiled politely.\nBut in the following seconds, the first two groups changed their expression to a surprised one before remaining in an awkward one.\nShang was too young to have such power.\nShang noticed all of that. 'Sure enough, these students are all very experienced. Some of them noticed my power at first glance, but even the ones that didn't quickly found out about it.'\nThis was a gigantic difference from how many other students had interacted with Shang.\nStars and his group hadn't even realized when Shang threatened them.\nThe older student in Stars group had slowly noticed Shang's power, but he had still taken a while to truly grasp it. The blonde guy that had tried to shove Shang to the side had also realized, but only when Shang had already shoved his arm to the side two times.\nThere were definite differences between students of different ages.\nThe newbies that were around 14 years old nearly never noticed Shang's power.\nThe 16-year-olds noticed it, but it wasn't easy, not all of them believed their feelings, and it took a bit.\nMeanwhile, the 18-year-olds noticed it from a distance in a matter of two seconds, and they quickly believed their instincts.\nAfter Shang entered the training field, a couple of students still looked at him.\nThen, one of them frowned.\n\"I think you're in the wrong grade,\" he said.",

      "content": "Chapter 98 Astor And Elver\nThe one that spoke to Shang was a tall man with short blue hair. He was probably around 19 years old, which was why Shang labeled him as a man instead of a boy. A truly gigantic, wide, and imposing sword was in his hands. The sword was probably one and a half meters long and half a meter wide.\nA gigantic axe or hammer showed a feeling of ferociousness and brutality, while a sword showed versatility and composure.\nThis gigantic sword exhibited a mixed feeling between those two.\nIt was ferocious and powerful, but there was also restraint inside it.\n'He's powerful,' Shang thought as he looked at the guy, a glint of surprise visible in his eyes.\nWhy surprise?\nBecause Shang felt a mortal feeling of danger radiating off that man.\nThat in and of itself wouldn't be that surprising, though. The surprising part was that he only had a body at the Late Soldier Stage, an entire level below Shang.\nYet, Shang could feel very clearly that, if the two of them were to fight seriously, Shang would most likely die.\n'Sure enough, I have to work on my Battle-Strength,' Shang thought. 'I can deal incredibly well with beasts, but I'm still a newbie when it comes to other humans.'\n\"Yeah, go back to suckling on your mommy's tits,\" another guy shouted from the side with a ridiculing voice.\nThe blue-haired man frowned, and Shang looked over at the other guy that just shouted.\nIt was a relatively small man with long green hair. He had a long but thin sword in his hand, and his smile showed ridicule and arrogance. Shang guessed that he was around 17 years old.\nWhen Shang saw the green-haired guy, he didn't feel threatened.\nHe definitely had quite some power to him, but he wasn't a real threat to Shang. Shang felt that, as long as he didn't become careless, he should easily win against him.\nThe green-haired guy wasn't even in the same world as the blue-haired man in terms of power.\n\"This is exactly why you are at the bottom of the class, Elver,\" the blue-haired man said with a rebuking tone as he looked at the green-haired guy, Elver. \"How often have the teachers told you to feel everyone's power closely, even if their appearance isn't threatening?\"\nElver frowned with discomfort. He definitely looked like someone that had been wrongfully accused. \"Why are you blaming me? You were the one that said it first, Astor,\" Elver said with a wronged voice.\n\"I meant he should be in the Preparation Grade, not the younger grades,\" Astor said with annoyance. \"He is at the Peak Soldier Stage.\"\n\"What?\" Elver shouted with surprise. Then, he looked at Shang, and his eyes widened in shock. \"How?\"\nBut after a bit, Elver furrowed his brows. Then, he snorted. \"Oh, no wonder. You're one of those noble kids, huh?\"\nShang only looked at Elver with a neutral expression.\n\"Bet your family has stuffed all kinds of pills and medicine into your body. Bet you haven't even killed a Pest Cat before,\" Elver said with a ridiculing snort.\nAstor only frowned, but he didn't say anything. In his perception, Shang's power also felt surprisingly weak for someone at the Peak Soldier Stage.\nAstor could fight a couple of Peak Soldier Stage students equally, but he couldn't say that he could beat any of them easily…\nExcept for Shang.\nAstor felt that he could beat Shang with a lot of confidence, which definitely wasn't normal.\nHowever, Astor still reserved his judgment of Shang. Yes, Shang had a very weak Battle-Strength, but he was also way younger than them.\nWith a couple of years of training, he could easily close the gap.\nAdditionally, Astor felt a certain feeling coming from Shang.\nAstor felt like Shang had seen his fair share of battles before.\nYet, that also didn't make much sense in Astor's mind. How could Shang's Battle-Strength be so weak if he had been in so many battles?\nBecause of all of these uncertainties, Astor reserved his judgment.\nMeanwhile, Shang looked at Elver for a second before turning to Astor again.\n\"I'm in the correct grade,\" he said. \"I'm part of the Advanced Caterpillar Class.\"\nThis surprised the listening students on the side.\nIt definitely wasn't normal to have someone with a more powerful body in a lower grade. After all, the power of the body was literally the sole criteria for which grade someone belonged to.\n\"Why are you in the Advanced Grade?\" someone asked.\nShang looked over.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Women were few and far between in the Warrior's Academy. Most of them focused on Magic and the ones that couldn't often chose a different career. Because of that, there weren't that many women in this academy.\nHowever, some of them still existed, like the person that had just asked Shang a question.\nShe had grey hair, but the hair color didn't make her seem old. It was obvious that this was her natural hair color. Contrary to what one might expect, she carried a huge and heavy war hammer.\nShe was also rather tall, and she was filled with muscle all over. She definitely wasn't a pushover.\n\"I'm in this grade because I need to work on my Battle-Strength for the next two years,\" Shang answered. \"I joined just a couple of days ago.\"\nThe grey-haired woman frowned, but she didn't say anything further.\n\"It's surprising that your parents can get such wealth and status but screw up raising a child to such a degree,\" Elver ridiculed from the side again. \"Your body's so powerful, but your power is so weak. Don't your parents know-\"\n\"You seem to be fully focused on my parents,\" Shang interrupted Elver. \"Is that because you are unhappy with yours?\"\nSome of the students were positively surprised when they saw that the new guy bit back, and they looked at Elver expectantly.\nMost of the students in the class had already grown annoyed by Elver's constant bullshit. In their eyes, he was acting like a child, looking for a fight with anyone he thought he could beat.\nThis reaction from the other students showed the difference between young teenagers and young adults.\nOftentimes, the bullies in middle school and high school were the popular kids in the class. After all, they were powerful, dominant, and their insults were funny.\nBut later, those same people would be more on the unpopular side. Most students at that age were at the school or academy to learn, and they didn't want to be annoyed by someone constantly harassing someone else. Additionally, it appeared childish in their minds.\nElver had probably been one of the more popular kids in the first two grades, but after entering the Advanced Grade, things had suddenly changed.\nWhen Elver heard Shang's words, he only snorted. \"You think I'm stupid enough to enter a fistfight with someone at the Peak Soldier Stage? How about you crawl back to your nanny and suck on some more medicine?\"\nShang didn't answer and looked at Astor instead. \"When does the teacher normally come? I have a couple of questions.\"\nAstor, who had returned to warming up by now, answered without looking at Shang. \"He should be here any second now.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Shang said before becoming silent again.\nThen, silence returned.\nMost of the students went back to doing whatever they were doing previously, while Elver kept throwing sneers at Shang.\nThe grey-haired woman also threw Shang some frowns, but Shang knew that they weren't supposed to be a provocation. He guessed that she was probably unhappy that someone with a more powerful body was in her grade.\nJust like Astor said, the teacher arrived a couple seconds later.\nWhen Shang saw the teacher, he covertly took a deep breath of annoyance.\n'Oh great, it's that guy.'",

      "content": "Chapter 99 Teacher Loran\nThe teacher had arrived.\nIt was a middle-aged man, probably in his forties. He had some grey hairs here and there, and he carried a sword at his waist.\nIt was that one teacher that had guarded the academy's gate at the night Shang had arrived.\nShang definitely wasn't the biggest fan of that teacher. For some reason, talking with him was annoying and frustrating.\n\"Alright, everyone,\" the teacher announced when he arrived. \"Let's get started with today's lesson.\"\n\"May I ask a question?\" the grey-haired woman asked with a loud but polite voice.\n\"What is it, Sarah?\" the teacher asked.\n\"Isn't the power of our bodies the very foundation on which the grades are decided?\" she asked.\n\"Yes, so?\" the teacher asked with a bit of annoyance.\n\"Then how come the new person in our grade has a body at the Peak Soldier Stage? He should be part of the Preparation Grade,\" Sarah asked.\nJust as Shang had expected, Sarah was bothered by Shang's presence in her grade.\nThe teacher frowned with confusion. After hearing Sarah's question, he looked around the gathered students and quickly found the odd one out.\nWhen he saw Shang, the teacher snorted a bit in annoyance. \"Of course you would end up in my class,\" he grumbled mostly to himself.\nShang wasn't certain how he should respond. Should he say sorry? Should he say hello?\nIn the end, Shang didn't bother with reacting at all and simply did nothing.\n\"I don't know. Let me ask,\" the teacher said to Sarah.\n\"Thank you,\" Sarah said politely.\nThe teacher summoned a small crystal and looked into it. \"Soran, what's going on? Why is there a Peak Soldier Stage student in my Advanced Grade?\"\n\"Hello, Loran. Isn't it a nice day?\" the exasperated voice of Soran came out of the crystal.\n\"Yes, yes, hello, Soran,\" the middle-aged teacher, teacher Loran, said with an annoyed voice. \"So, why is there a Peak Soldier Stage student in my Advanced Grade?\"\n\"Are you talking about Shang?\" Soran's voice asked. \"Did he finally show up to his lessons?\"\n\"I don't know his name,\" teacher Loran grumbled.\n\"Then why don't you go ask him?\" Soran's voice said.\nTeacher Loran grumbled. \"Hey, you,\" he shouted as he looked at Shang.\n\"Yes, I'm Shang,\" Shang answered.\n\"I didn't even ask my question! It's common courtesy to let others finish speaking,\" the teacher grumbled.\nShang frowned. \"Isn't it obvious what you were going to ask? We can all hear your discussion. I just wanted to hurry things along.\"\n\"Hurry things along?\" the teacher snorted. \"Then how come we are talking so much about this topic? If you had just given me the time to ask my question, we would already be done.\"\n\"That's bec-\"Shang started to shout, but he stopped himself.\nThen, he took a long breath.\nThis man was now his teacher, and Shang shouldn't argue too much with him.\n\"Yes, teacher, I won't interrupt you again,\" Shang said with a bit of annoyance.\n\"What?!\" teacher Loran nearly shouted. \"Why did you give in?! It's obvious that you do not truly believe what you're saying! Do you think I'm so stupid that I would fall for that?!\"\nShang gritted his teeth in frustration. \"Because I don't want to get into an argument with the very person that I'm supposed to learn from,\" Shang said a little louder.\n\"So, what's his name?\" Soran's voice came out of the crystal again. \"You haven't answered in a while. Did you get into an argument again?\"\nTeacher Loran had just wanted to shout back at Shang, but Soran's voice stopped him. \"Yes, his name is Shang. So, why is he in my grade?\" he asked again.\nHow did the other students react to that exchange?\nSurprisingly, they weren't surprised at all.\nJudging from their reactions, it seemed to be normal for teacher Loran to get into arguments all the time.\n\"There's a reason behind it,\" Soran answered.\n\"No shi- crap. I'm asking what the reason is!\" teacher Loran snapped back.\n\"If I could tell you the reason, I would have told you, Loran,\" Soran said with a bit of annoyance. \"However, I can't tell you the reason since it's confidential. Just know that Shang is in your grade by the orders of the dean.\"\nSilence.\nThe dean?!\nUsually, it was Soran who decided on all the different classes and grades. He was solely responsible for assigning the students to the most fitting class. The dean never got involved in all of that. The dean was busy with all kinds of administrative work, meetings, and so on.\nHowever, he had made an executive decision for Shang?\nWhy?\nThe students very rarely heard of the dean. They saw him enter and exit the building from time to time, but that was about it. So, why did he suddenly get involved when it came to this student?\n\"The dean's orders?\" teacher Loran asked again.\n\"Yes,\" Soran said. \"As for Shang's development, you only have to check on two things. If you have me on speaker, please deactivate it since the other students are not supposed to listen in on private matters of other students.\"\n'Speaker?' Shang thought with a weird expression. 'Is that crystal a phone? I mean, it kind of is, but it still feels weird to hear the word speakerphone in this world.'\nTeacher Loran put the crystal to his ear and walked a couple of meters away. After that, he spoke quietly into the crystal.\nThe other students waited for about a minute until teacher Loran returned.\n\"Alright, let's start with the lesson,\" teacher Loran announced.\n\"Excuse me, teacher,\" Sarah, the grey-haired woman, said. \"What about my question? Why is he in our grade?\"\nTeacher Loran frowned. \"You heard what I heard! You know what I know! What answer do you expect from me? He's here under the dean's orders. If you have a problem with that, go complain to the dean!\"\nSarah frowned at the barrage teacher Loran had unleashed on her. \"Thank you, teacher,\" she said with a bit of annoyance.\nTeacher Loran snorted silently. \"Alright, so let's start with class.\"\n\"I've got a question,\" Shang interrupted.\n\"What?!\" teacher Loran snapped back. \"Stop trying to delay the lesson again and again! What's up with you?!\"\n\"This was the first time I interrupted,\" Shang said with a frown. \"The previous two questions came from someone else. This is the first question I've asked you today.\"\n\"I don't care! You're the reason why class is late! Ask your question after the lesson!\" teacher Loran shouted.\n\"I don't know if it can wait for that long,\" Shang said.\nTeacher Loran groaned loudly. \"Fine! Go ahead! Ask!\"\n\"How do I reach the General Stage?\" Shang asked.\nFor a second, teacher Loran looked at Shang with surprise.\nWhy?\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Well…\n\"How can you be so stupid?!\" teacher Loran shouted. \"You know very well that you are not supposed to reach the General Stage!\"\n\"I fucking know that!\" Shang shouted as he couldn't control his frustration anymore. \"I'm asking so that I can specifically avoid doing that! I don't want to reach the General Stage on accident!\"\nThe students looked with complex expressions at Shang.\nAccidentally reaching the General Stage?\nThey were working with all their power to one day reach the General Stage, but Shang was afraid of accidentally getting there?\nAnd what was teacher Loran's answer?\n\"That question could have waited for after class!\" he grumbled with frustration.\n\"And how am I supposed to know that?!\" Shang shouted. \"I don't know how to reach it! So, I also don't know how much time I have left to ask!\"\nAt the side, Astor sighed.\nWhy were teacher Loran's lessons always late?\nWhy did he always have to fall into an argument with someone right before the lessons started?",

      "content": "Chapter 100 Soldier To General\nAfter a couple more minutes of arguing, Shang finally got his answer.\nAccording to teacher Loran's explanation, to advance in the Soldier Stage required the warrior to strengthen different parts of their body.\nA normal human would reach the Initial Soldier Stage by simply becoming an adult. The natural presence of Mana in the surroundings strengthened their bodies naturally to a certain extent.\nBecause of that, even the most normal adult already had a body on the level of a professional athlete on Earth.\nOf course, reaching the Initial Soldier Stage at the age of 18 was already way too late for someone that wanted to become a warrior. If someone wanted to become a warrior, they needed to reach the Initial Soldier Stage at the age of 14, at the latest.\nThe way of reaching the Initial Soldier Stage early was very simple.\nNormal training.\nRunning around, lifting some stuff, climbing stuff, whatever. As long as the child was very physically active, they would reach it early.\nWhen Shang asked if excessive training at such a young age could have negative effects on a child's development, everyone looked at him like he was a weirdo.\nAfter some ridicule, Shang simply swallowed his frustration.\nShang couldn't be faulted for his question. After all, on Earth, excessive physical training at such a young age could cause issues with bone development. That was also why fitness centers often only accepted kids aged 14 and up.\nBut, apparently, in this world, it was no concern. Shang guessed that it was the Mana that allowed kids to train so much without any issues.\nTo reach the Early Soldier Stage, it was necessary to train one's skin and muscles. The training of the muscles was obvious, but the training of the skin was a bit weird in Shang's mind.\nHowever, it also made sense. If the muscles bulged too much, the sudden expansion could tear the skin. One had to remember that people in this world were far more powerful than people on Earth. On Earth, the skin had enough time to deal with the expansion of mass since it didn't happen very quickly.\nIn this world, it was an issue.\nOn top of that, if the skin weren't properly trained, it wouldn't let much Mana through. In a way, the skin was a filter for Mana, and at the base level, the skin would block a lot of Mana from entering the body.\nHowever, the more Mana the skin of someone had, the easier it was for the body to absorb Mana. That additional absorption was imperative to reach the later levels of the Soldier Stage.\nShang remembered that he had bled quite a lot in Duke Whirlwind's garden. That was also how he had trained his skin.\nTo reach the Middle Soldier Stage, one needed to also train one's bones. After reaching the Early Soldier Stage, the muscles slowly closed in on having enough power to break one's own bones if they were stressed too much.\nNow, how did one train one's bones?\nWell, there were three methods.\nMethod one was to ingest Bone Dissolving Grass or medicine made out of Bone Dissolving Grass. Just as the name suggested, Bone Dissolving Grass was a poison that dissolved bone.\nOn Earth, such a poison would have been viewed as something insanely cruel. It could essentially cripple someone forever.\nBut here, it was a treasure. With Mana, one could regrow bone with quite a lot of speed.\nBone Dissolving Grass was rather common, but it was still a bit expensive due to the demand. However, it wasn't an issue for someone in the Early Soldier Stage to get enough money to buy Bone Dissolving Grass.\nSadly, that method was rather painful.\nOf course, the rich people could also buy medicine made out of Bone Dissolving Grass and numbing agents to make the training much easier to handle.\nThe first method was the slowest one of the three methods.\nThe second method was to simply not train one's bones.\nNot training one's bones didn't sound very conducive when the goal was to train one's bones, but, ironically, it actually worked.\nIf someone simply continued training their body, at one point, their own muscles would break their bones one by one, and that would strengthen them.\nHowever, nearly no one did that. After all, not all the bones would be broken by the muscles. Chest muscles and head muscles needed a lot of time and training to become powerful enough to break their respective bones.\nThe third method was the simplest.\nJust break your bones and ingest healing medicine.\nIt was very straightforward, but in a way, it was also the hardest to pull off. Not everyone had the willpower to straight-up break their own bones.\nIt was also very dangerous. After all, if a bone broke in a weird way, it could cause internal bleeding, which would quickly spell the death of the warrior if they didn't receive immediate healing.\nBecause of that, nearly no one used the third method. It was cruel and dangerous.\nBut wait!\nIf this were so dangerous, how did Shang manage to pull it off in such a reckless manner without dying?\nIt was his warrior's body, obviously. His mind didn't consume a large amount of Mana in comparison to people without a warrior's body. Additionally, Shang had always overfilled his Mana storages before injuring himself.\nOther people avoided overfilling their Mana storages. After all, if they did, they would be forced into nearly killing themselves with no way back. Humans generally didn't like being in a situation where they had to do something drastic to survive, and they definitely didn't like putting themselves into such a situation.\nIf their willpower weren't powerful enough, they would die.\nThis was how one reached the Middle Soldier Stage.\nTo reach the Late Soldier Stage, one needed to train their blood.\nYes, blood came from the bone marrow, but just breaking the bone wasn't enough to strengthen the production and quality of blood.\nIn order to do that, one needed to bleed… a lot.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ The body had to essentially fall into a bloodless crisis. The body had to be in a situation where, if it didn't up its blood production, it would die.\nAfter upping the blood production by a lot, and if that still weren't enough, the body would switch from quantity to quality, allowing less blood to carry more Mana and nutrients.\nWhen both things had been achieved to a sufficient degree, one would have reached the Late Soldier Stage.\nMost people reached that level by ingesting Mana Inhibition Powder.\nMana Inhibition Powder made the transportation of Mana very difficult for someone. If a normal person ingested that powder, they would probably die since Mana was an essential component to survival.\nHowever, if a Mid Soldier Stage warrior ingested it, they would simply lose consciousness.\nThe body would notice that it couldn't transfer enough Mana, so it upped the blood production and its quality. It was essentially a way to train one's blood without bleeding.\nOf course, the other way to train one's blood was to simply bleed a lot.\nShang had bled quite a bit.\nTo reach the Peak Soldier Stage, one needed to train one's organs.\nThe common method to train one's organs was to simply ingest several different kinds of medicine, which were quite expensive. However, a warrior at that Stage could earn a lot of money already.\nAfter ingesting the medicine, they would only need to meditate and gather Mana while their organs would slowly be dissolved.\nAs long as someone meditated, it wasn't dangerous, but it could get dangerous if someone were interrupted.\nThat was also why the academy forbade other students from breaking down the door of another student.\nOf course, the other way to reach that level was to simply injure one's organs the normal way.\nThat method was a bit more dangerous and painful.\nAnd finally, how did one reach the Second Realm, the General Stage?\nThe heart.\nThe heart was the crux.\nThe heart required much more training than all the other organs, and the heart also acted as a major storage for Mana in this world.\nIn order to train the heart, one either needed to continually injure their entire body again and again to put it under stress or directly injure the heart itself, which was very dangerous.\nOf course, if someone didn't want to do that, they could also ingest a type of medicine that accomplished that.\nThe medicine had a name that Shang found quite funny.\nIt was called Heartburn Medicine.\nBack when Soran had inspected Shang's body, he had checked up on how far along exactly Shang was in his training.\nAccording to Soran, Shang was around 60% done with his heart.\nIf Shang wanted to reach the General Stage, he would need to destroy his entire body at least another 40 times. As long as he avoided doing that, he would be able to remain in the Soldier Stage.\nAfter everything had been explained to Shang, teacher Loran started the lesson.\nAnd the very first thing teacher Loran did was to put Shang into a fight.\nAgainst whom?\nAstor.",

      "content": "Chapter 101 Astor's Power\nShang was a bit surprised that he had to fight someone as powerful as Astor right at the beginning.\nDid teacher Loran want to punish Shang for annoying him?\nTeacher Loran noticed Shang's expression and snorted. \"Don't think of yourself as too important,\" he scoffed. \"You are the only person that I haven't seen fight yet, and I need to see your fighting style first.\"\n\"And that's why you're sending me against the strongest of the grade?\" Shang asked with a frown.\n\"Blame your body,\" teacher Loran said. \"You have an unfair advantage over everyone else.\"\nShang didn't like hearing that he had an unfair advantage, but it was the truth. It was already a shame that he was the only student in a lower grade than they were supposed to be.\n\"This is your first lesson in the academy, right?\" Astor asked from the side as he slowly readied his huge sword.\nWhen Shang saw Astor look at him with his readied sword, he felt his heart shake.\nPowerful!\nAstor felt so very powerful!\nAstor was on a lower level than Shang, and Shang's body was nearly twice as strong as Astor's. Yet, Astor still felt so incredibly powerful to Shang.\nShang knew that he wouldn't win.\nShing!\nShang took out his sword and readied it. He knew that he couldn't win, but he would still give his all. This was not a fight for survival but a learning opportunity!\n\"As always,\" teacher Loran said, \"whenever you draw your weapons, you must feel genuine killing intent. This is not an exception!\"\nThen, teacher Loran looked at Shang. \"Under my supervision, none of you two will die. At my level, I can walk back and forth between you two over ten times before you can even finish half a swing. If you actually manage to kill your sparring partner, I will dedicate my life to being your servant. That's how confident I am.\"\nThe other students didn't react to teacher Loran's words. They all already knew of the power of a Commander Stage warrior.\nEven the weakest Commander Stage warriors could reach 200kph in a single step, and that wasn't even their top speed. Additionally, even though they were warriors, their minds had still been infused with a lot of Mana just by having such a Mana-rich body around them.\nEven a Commander Stage warrior with a warrior's body had, at least, a level two mind, which would technically allow them to become Adepts, as long as they knew how to properly cast spells.\nThat meant that their reaction times and thinking speeds were unimaginable for some mere Soldier Stage warriors.\nEven if Shang were to use the sneakiest and fastest attack available, if teacher Loran didn't want it to hit, it wouldn't hit.\nShang nodded. He didn't exactly know how powerful Commander Stage warriors were, but since teacher Loran assured him that much, he believed him. Teacher Loran didn't seem to be the lying kind.\nShang readied himself and watched Astor carefully.\nAstor slowly lifted his sword. As he did, the ground beneath him began to crack for some reason. It was almost like Astor had suddenly become far heavier.\nAstor's body rotated until the sword was behind him.\nFor a moment, the world seemed to freeze.\nShang was preparing himself. If he were fighting for his survival, he would have struck first. However, Shang wanted to learn. If his opponent didn't take this fight seriously and Shang did, Shang could theoretically win. As long as an opponent was caught unprepared, even someone very weak could take them down.\nBecause of that, Shang let Astor prepare himself.\nAstor was over ten meters away, but for some reason, Shang's instincts screamed at him. On top of that, Astor's pressure built more and more.\nAnd then, Astor stopped.\nIn that instant, Shang felt his instincts scream at him! They were shouting that he would die if he didn't evade right this instant!\nSo, Shang did as his instincts told him.\nBANG!\nA small explosion of dirt appeared beneath Astor. All his power was put into his sword, and he swung forward.\nAnd then, when the sword reached sufficient speed, he stopped adding more power to the swing, which resulted in Astor's sword flying forward.\nHowever, Astor didn't let go.\nAll the power that Astor had pushed into the slash outweighed his body's weight by far too much. On top of that, his sword was ridiculously heavy.\nThis all culminated in Astor being carried forward by his heavy sword.\nObviously, on Earth, such a maneuver was impossible. After all, a human just couldn't put in that much power. However, if someone took up an incredibly heavy hammer and swung it with all their power forward, they would still need to take a couple of steps forward while trying to stop it.\nThat was the same principle but pushed to the extreme.\nAnd it had incredible effects.\nAstor had moved with astonishing speeds for his level.\nIf Shang hadn't evaded early, thanks to his instincts, he wouldn't have had the time to react to Astor's attack properly.\nAstor was one level below Shang, but with that swing, Astor had reached a speed that surpassed Shang's top speed.\nAstor used an incredibly heavy and hefty sword, and speed should be his weakness. He had traded speed for immense destructive potential and a potential shield, which could be used by simply turning the sword sideways.\nBut with that move, Astor had managed to completely get rid of his weakness.\nNow, Astor had his two strengths without the weakness.\nAnd his offensive power was… scary.\nShang had barely evaded and quickly readied his counterattack.\nYet, Astor had also stopped right beside Shang. It was almost like he had used Magic.\nBut wait, how could Astor suddenly stop? Where did all the power of the swing go?\nInto another swing.\nAstor's sword didn't stop. It simply changed direction.\nShang had readied a counterattack, but Astor's sword was already slashing at him.\nShang knew that he could hit Astor, but he would have to exchange hits with him.\nUsually, Shang had no issues with trading hits. After all, he was very good at dealing with injuries, and he had a lot of regenerative abilities.\nBut this time, it was different.\nIf Shang got hit, all his regenerative abilities wouldn't matter.\nThat attack had so much power behind it that Shang would most likely explode, and if he didn't, he would lose everything below his chest at the very least.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang wasn't confident in taking Astor's head during that time, which was essentially the only way he had to kill him.\nSo, in short, this meant that Shang would most definitely die while Astor would maybe die.\nThat was not a good trade.\nHowever, it also was too late for Shang to evade.\nBecause of that, he could only block the swing with his sword. At worst, he would get some broken arms, which would heal rather quickly.\nFor a moment, Shang considered using his Affinity. With a powerful blast of wind, Shang could push himself out of harm's way.\nHowever, Shang put the secrecy of his Affinity above victory in a spar.\nSo, Shang readied his block.\nAnd then…\nWOOOSH!\nA strong wind blew Shang's hair back, but the attack never arrived.\nTeacher Loran also hadn't done anything.\nIt was Astor who had stopped.\nFor a split second, Shang wanted to attack since his instincts told him that his opponent had lost all momentum, but a second later, his rational mind took over.\nAstor slowly pulled his sword back. \"Teacher Loran will protect our lives, but not our weapons,\" Astor said.\nShang looked at his sword, and at that moment, Shang felt his sword's feelings.\nIt was deep terror.\nIt was like the sword had just faced death.\nShang gritted his teeth. In his need to come up with a solution in basically no time at all, Shang had overlooked the fact that his sword wasn't invincible. Yes, it had never been broken before, but the Frozen Lake Stag had put a scratch in it.\nWas Astor's attack stronger or weaker than the attack of the Frozen Lake Stag?\nIt wasn't even a question.\n\"I win eight out of ten fights because I manage to destroy my opponent's weapon,\" Astor slowly explained. \"My fighting style revolves all around the weight of my weapon. It needs to be so heavy that I can barely swing it by using all of my power.\"\n\"Materials of the First Rank can't achieve such heaviness. Because of that, a vast majority of my wealth gets invested into my weapon, and it is currently comprised of materials equivalent to the Middle General Stage.\"\n\"With its sheer weight and hardness, it can even destroy materials equivalent to the Early General Stage in one swing.\"\n\"I know a lot about weapons, and I can tell that your weapon wouldn't have even proved a hindrance. My sword would have cleaved through it and your body if teacher Loran weren't here,\" Astor slowly explained.\nThen, Astor walked back to the same location he had started from earlier and readied his weapon again.\n\"This one doesn't count. This time, try to take the fight actually serious and attack me before I can get all my momentum going,\" he said as he pointed his sword at Shang from a distance.\nShang took a deep breath.\nHe had made a mistake.\nHe had nearly lost his weapon.\nIn the future, he had to be more careful with the durability of his sword.\nShang closed his eyes for a moment and readied himself mentally.\n\"Thank you, and sorry,\" Shang said as he readied his sword again. \"This time, I won't let you build your momentum.\"\nAstor nodded.\nAnd then, he readied his swing again.",

      "content": "Chapter 102 Experience\nBANG!\nShang exploded forward with his sword.\nThis time, he would be on the offensive!\nHe hadn't done that before since he had come here to learn. Yet, in his eagerness to learn from his opponent's attacks, he had learned nearly nothing since the fight had ended in basically one swing. The power of the first swing had been used in the second swing, which could technically make it count as the first swing.\n'I have to get rid of the mindset that I need to go easy on Astor to learn from him,' he thought.\nAstor had barely finished half of his wind-up when Shang arrived with his sword. Shang had the speed advantage due to his more powerful body as long as Astor couldn't build his momentum.\nAt the moment, Astor's sword was far behind him, and he lacked the speed to block Shang's attack. Additionally, since Shang had the speed advantage, Astor wouldn't be able to easily evade, and if he did, the evasion would be sloppy and would mess with his balance.\nBecause of all of these reasons, Shang didn't slash but stabbed forward. That would reach his opponent the fastest.\nShang had no idea how Astor could escape.\nIf he were in Astor's shoes, he also wouldn't find a method to get out of this one.\nAnd then, Astor stopped.\nA split-second later, Astor's left foot gathered nearly all the accumulated power of the swing and unleashed it in a stomp.\nBANG!\nThe ground cracked as an incredible amount of power was pushed into it from one point.\nShang hadn't expected the ground to shake and crack in front of him, which meant that he wasn't able to react properly.\nThe ground shook, and Shang's sword barely missed Astor's torso.\nHowever, even if it was barely, it still missed.\nShang's eyes widened as he realized the new dynamic in the fight.\nInitially, Shang had caught Astor in an indefensible position. Shang had all the momentum, and Astor had nothing.\nBut now, Shang had completely lost his balance as his sword didn't hit anything, while Astor stood as firm and stable as a rock in front of him.\nHowever, Shang still knew that he had the speed and power advantage thanks to his body, and he would make full use of it. From his offset position, Shang quickly used all his power and made his extended sword swing towards Astor's torso.\nThe wind-up was tiny, and Shang couldn't put a lot of power into such an awkward swing, but his sword was sharp, and Shang had a more powerful body.\nThis should be enough to, at least, injure Astor. Additionally, Shang could use that swing to gain some space to rebalance.\nAs Shang's sword went towards Astor's torso, Astor's body lowered as he gathered power in his left foot.\nAnd then, Shang's sword hit.\nClink!\nShang's eyes widened as his sword bounced off Astor's uniform!\nHe hadn't expected that!\nBANG!\nAstor finished gathering his power, and he shot forward with his shoulder, hitting Shang in the chest.\nShang had a more powerful body, but that charge had so much weight being it that he still got shot into the distance by several meters.\nShang lost his breath for an instant, and an incredible pressure built up in his chest. A normal warrior would be stunned for at least two seconds under such an attack.\nHowever, Shang had dealt with such injuries many, many times.\nCRRRK!\nShang's feet hit the ground and created a ditch as they stopped his momentum.\nBANG!\nThen, Shang shot forward before Astor could ready his strike.\nFor an instant, Astor's eyes showed a bit of surprise, but they quickly returned to their cold selves again.\nShang reached Astor again before he could build up his momentum.\nThis time, Astor canceled his swing early. The swing wasn't as insanely powerful as the first one in the last fight, but it still had a lot of weight behind it.\nShang noticed that Astor wasn't using a block. Astor was using a wide swing, which was mostly for attacking purposes.\nHowever, the sheer size of his sword automatically transformed the aggressive attack into a secondary block. Shang couldn't possibly take Astor's heart or head before he got hit.\nBut Shang didn't stop.\nHe continued running.\nAnd then, Astor's swing arrived.\nCRRRR!\nShang suddenly slid on the ground. The swing would pass over him, and Shang would have an opportunity to take Astor's heart.\nAnd Shang was right. The swing did pass over him.\nHowever, it didn't directly pass over him, but quite a bit above him.\nAstor had changed the trajectory of his swing to not be horizontal but diagonal in a curved line. It essentially traveled in a hyperbola.\nAstor's sword was now right above his head, fully extended to the sky. Both of his arms bulged as an insane amount of power gathered in them.\nShang felt the pressure from above him, but instead of despairing, he saw a chance!\nShang was currently right in front of Astor's waist, and he could stab Astor's heart before Astor could reach him.\nShang would kill Astor before Astor could kill him.\nShang's sword shot forward as it stabbed right towards Astor's chest.\nWhen Astor saw that, his eyes seemingly began to burn. It was like he was suddenly unleashing all the power inside his being as an incredible amount of rage and brutality exploded forward.\nShang's sword hit.\nCRACK!\nShang's eyes widened.\n'What?!'\nShang's sword had hit Astor's chest, but when it did, several Magic Runes appeared on the uniform, converging in some sort of barrier.\nThe barrier broke apart, and the uniform lost its luster. However, Shang's sword had been stopped.\nWhat had just happened!?\nAnd then, Shang felt it.\nPressure.\nIncredible pressure.\nIt was like Shang was in front of a monster that wanted to do nothing but kill him.\nThe sword above Astor shot down with an insane amount of power and speed.\nShang was still half on the ground, and his attack had just been stopped.\nHe couldn't evade.\nThe sword came right for Shang's head, exploding with the storming sounds of wind being cut.\nClink!\n\"Alright, that should be it,\" teacher Loran said as he stopped Astor's sword with two fingers.\nFor a moment, Shang couldn't breathe.\nIn the first fight, Shang had believed he would survive by blocking, but in this fight, he had looked death in the eye.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ It was just like that time when that Pest Cat had jumped him when Shang hadn't had his weapon yet.\nIt was the image of death.\nThe entire fight replayed in Shang's head.\nShang had the advantage in power and speed.\nYet, why hadn't it felt that way?\nBecause of technique!\nAstor was slower than Shang, but he had always managed to completely stop Shang's momentum in some way. On top of that, Astor had probably planned his moves in advance. After all, it was very, very difficult to change the trajectory of such a heavy sword on the fly.\nIn essence, Astor had beaten Shang with surprise, intelligence, and technique.\nAstor pulled his sword back as he took a deep breath.\nAnd then, he smiled!\n\"I didn't expect for you to wake the warrior inside of me,\" he said with a smile as he offered Shang a hand. \"For a second there, I went all in.\"\nShang was still a bit shaken by the close encounter with death, but he accepted the hand absentmindedly.\nHe only had one question.\n\"What happened with my attack earlier? I thought I got you,\" he said in a bit of confusion.\n\"Your uniforms have an Enchantment that grants them the ability to block one Soldier Stage attack that would hit your heart,\" teacher Loran explained. \"The remaining parts of the uniform also have defensive powers, but not nearly as strong as the ones guarding your heart.\"\nThat explained how Shang's attack had been blocked.\n'I should have gone for his head,' Shang thought, but an instant later, Shang realized something.\nYes, both of Astor's arms had been above his head…\nBut his left upper arm had been between Shang and his head!\nWith the added mass between the head, the blockage of vision, and the small defense of the uniform, Shang's chances of injuring Astor's brain before Astor's attack hit him were tiny!\nEven more, Astor had probably been prepared to move his left arm to the side if Shang's sword stabbed it. At that point, Astor would have already put basically all of his power into the swing.\n'What could I have done to win?'\n…\n'The only way to win would have been to anticipate the earlier feint. As soon as I fell for the feint, the fight was already over.'\nShang took a deep breath and closed his eyes.\nThen, they opened again, and fiery ambition could be seen in them.\n'This is exactly what I need!'\n'Experience!'\n'This is exactly why I have come to this place!'",

      "content": "Chapter 103 Mattheo\n\"Alright, Astor,\" teacher Loran said. \"Go two rounds with Mattheo.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ On the side, a young man with long red hair sighed. He had two very heavy and hard gauntlets with spikes near the knuckles. Surprisingly, he was using knuckles as his weapons.\nAstor looked at Mattheo and gestured to the side with his head. The two of them had fought many times before. Astor was the most powerful person in the Advanced Grade Caterpillar Class, and Mattheo was the second strongest. Because of that, it mostly fell on Mattheo's shoulders to fight with Astor.\n\"It would be really great if you could hurry up and become more powerful,\" Mattheo said to Shang while walking past him with a helpless and somewhat joking tone. \"I don't want to spar with that guy every time I come here.\"\n\"I'll try my best,\" Shang said.\nMattheo only chuckled a bit. \"You do know that I was only joking, right? You can take all the time you need.\"\nShang wasn't quite sure how to respond. On Earth, he would have simply given off a polite and small chuckle, but right now, he just didn't want to. It was like it was just too much work.\nWhile Mattheo walked to Astor, Sarah frowned with frustration. She had worked so hard, and she was absolutely certain that she could fight evenly with Mattheo. Yes, she had lost every match so far, but all of their fights had been even most of the time.\nAs one of the very few women in the class, Sarah felt like she had to prove herself. Oftentimes, women weren't seen as talented warriors by men. After all, the sad truth was that it was harder for women to reach the different levels in the Soldier Stage.\nThe power one needed to reach each level was universal. It didn't matter if the warrior was huge or small, thin or thick. Sadly, that meant that smaller and weaker people needed to train more than bigger people.\nIt only became irrelevant as soon as the warrior reached the Peak Soldier Stage. At that point, gender and size didn't matter anymore. After all, everyone would have the same starting point.\nSarah trained so hard and put so much effort into her career, but she still hadn't been allowed to spar with Astor. Sarah was mostly put against the fourth or fifth strongest in the class, which she always decimated in a fight.\nWhen Astor was on a mission, Sarah would get to spar with Mattheo. Those spars were very even, but she hadn't been able to win yet. Because of that, Sarah was certain that she could also act as a sparring partner to Astor.\n\"Sarah, you go fight with Shang,\" teacher Loran said. \"I haven't been able to properly see his techniques yet since Astor won that quickly.\"\nSarah frowned as she glanced at Shang. She was already annoyed that Shang was in her grade with a superior body. After all, the body was literally the only criterium that decides which grade someone belonged to.\nIt was literally unfair. That wasn't even a subjective perspective but an objective one.\nOf course, on top of that, Shang didn't even deserve to fight with the likes of Astor. After all, if Shang didn't have such a powerful body, he would be at the bottom of the class. His body was literally the only thing strong about him.\nShang wasn't oblivious to other people's feelings. He could very well imagine how many people in the class felt.\nHow did Shang feel?\nOf course Shang felt a bit embarrassed. After all, he was essentially the equivalent of someone that had been held back a grade. They didn't manage to reach the grades necessary to advance, which meant that they had to repeat a year. That person would then sit in a room with people one year younger than them.\nIt was embarrassing. Such a situation gave off a feeling of inadequacy.\nHowever, Shang wasn't too embarrassed. Yes, it was bad that he had the most powerful body out of all of them, but Shang also didn't forget that he was literally four years younger than all of them.\nShang had advanced far faster on his path to power than everyone else in the school. At 15, he managed to reach a level that normally only 20-year-olds could reach. On top of that, Shang had only been in this world for a bit more than six months.\nBecause of that, it was also unfair to say that Shang was too powerful for this grade. After all, Shang had only had six months of training. That amount of time basically counted as nothing.\nSadly, in this world, age didn't matter.\nEverything revolved around power.\nIt didn't matter if Shang were 30 or six years old. As long as he was in the same Realm, everyone would look at him the same way.\nBOOM!\nShang looked over and saw that Astor and Mattheo had already started fighting a couple of meters away, and very quickly, Shang's eyes widened.\nSmall explosions came out of Mattheo's feet and elbows, boosting his speed. This made Mattheo reach the same speeds as Shang, even though Mattheo had a far weaker body. That was already very impressive.\nOn top of that, Mattheo managed to unleash an absolute barrage on Astor. With the speed of his two fists and the explosions, he let Astor gain absolutely no momentum. He was essentially barraging him with a storm of attacks every single second.\nHe managed to be far more aggressive than Shang, and the pressure Astor was under was obviously also far higher than when he fought Shang.\nAstor didn't even manage to unleash an attack yet. He simply didn't have any opportunity to.\nAs a watcher, Shang couldn't imagine how Astor could win that fight. He was essentially being suppressed into a passive state, only waiting for his defeat.\nYet, for some reason, Astor managed to always just barely parry or evade an attack. Sometimes, he would push his shoulder forward and receive Mattheo's fist, which he would skillfully divert to the side.\nIt was insane! The control one had to have to pull something like that off was nuts!\nBut even Astor couldn't parry such an avalanche of attacks for long. A couple of seconds later, he messed up a parry, and his shoulder got broken.\nAnd that's when it happened.\nSuddenly, water appeared beneath Astor's feet. It wasn't much water, and it definitely couldn't hurt anyone. It almost seemed senseless to summon that water.\nYet, just an instant later, the water below Astor's feet quickly pushed him half a meter to the side. It came very sudden and without warning. It didn't make any sound, and it basically just happened.\nBut the effect was devastating.\nThis sudden repositioning had caught Mattheo off-guard. Mattheo had just released an attack, and he was off-balance.\nAs Astor moved to the side, the power that had destroyed his shoulder got used by Astor. He allowed his shoulder to be shot back, and Astor rotated with the power. In essence, Astor was using his opponent's power to rotate.\nAnd then Astor suddenly stopped.\nAll the power of his rotation had been pushed into his sword, and his sword swung towards Mattheo with insane speeds.\n\"Alright,\" teacher Loran said as he stopped Astor's sword.\nAstor and Mattheo released a sigh.\n\"You've become better,\" Astor said with a praising smile.\nMattheo only smiled bitterly. \"Thanks.\"\nOn the side, Shang's eyes were still wide.\nOnly now did he truly realize how far away he was from Astor.\nAstor hadn't even used his Affinity against Shang. On top of that, Shang hadn't managed to put even nearly as much pressure on Astor as Mattheo.\nShang had thought that he wasn't too far away from Astor, but that was obviously not the case.\nThere were worlds between them.\nLiterally, the only reason how Shang had been able to fight him for a couple of exchanges was due to his body.\nThe difference in experience was massive.\n\"Watched enough?\"\nShang looked over at Sarah, who had pulled out her hammer by now. \"Teacher Loran can keep watch over up to three fights at once. I let you watch their fight so that you can truly see the distance between you and them.\"\n\"You are in our grade, and there's nothing I can do about it. Only you can do something about it.\"\nSarah raised her hammer. \"Become powerful enough to no longer be a shame to us.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 104 Counter\nIn a way, Shang didn't like hearing that, but he also knew that she was right. At the moment, he was an embarrassment to the class. He had the highest level out of everyone, but he wasn't even close to being the strongest. There were at least two people in this class that could jump levels against him.\nLosing to someone of a lower level was always a shameful affair. Sadly, Shang just hadn't had enough time to train.\nBut hey, that was why he was in the academy.\nHe specifically came to this academy because he knew that he wasn't experienced when it came to fighting against humans.\nTeacher Loran called out the next two pairs, who began to fight pretty quickly. From what Shang saw, teacher Loran was going from strong to weak.\n\"I will start now. Don't disappoint me,\" Sarah said with a dark voice.\nShang narrowed his eyes and readied his weapon.\nBANG!\nAnd Shang shot forward. He had already learned that taking it easy against these people was a bad idea. They were all warriors, and they had a lot of experience.\nShang closed in on Sarah with incredible speed. However, instead of releasing a strike, he only held his sword in a flexible position. He was using the advantage of his speed by forcing Sarah to act first. With his superior speed, he could react very well against any of her attacks.\nSarah's expression didn't change. Her right hand pulled the huge hammer back, readying it for an attack.\nHowever, her left hand was moving towards Shang and his sword.\nOnly now did Shang realize that Sarah was wearing gauntlets. Usually, the students only wore their uniforms and their weapons. They didn't wear additional armor. Yet, Sarah did just that.\nWhy?\nFor what purpose?\nShang quickly slashed at Sarah's hand. Since she had already offered her arm to him, he might as well accept.\nHowever, just before Shang's sword cut Sarah's arm, Shang felt a feeling of fear and terror come from his sword.\nThe feeling was nearly as powerful as when Astor was about to hit it with his sword.\nShang very quickly realized what was happening.\nShang knew the nine Affinities, and he also knew that hair color was very often an indicator of one's Affinity.\nShang hadn't seen grey hair before, but he could imagine what Affinity it represented.\nMetal.\nIf Shang could absorb Ice Mana with his left arm, could Sarah absorb Metal Mana with her left arm?\nThen, if Shang's sword hit her hand…\nShang immediately pulled back his sword.\nSarah's eyes narrowed even further when she saw that Shang had pulled back his sword. She had thought that Shang had no experience in fighting with humans, but this action of his had proven otherwise.\nSadly, what Sarah didn't know was that Shang truly had no experience in fighting with humans. His ability to make the correct choice came from the voice of his sword and his honed instincts.\nWhen Shang pulled back his sword, Sarah unleashed a strike with her huge hammer.\nShang felt an aura of destruction approach. It was almost like Sarah's hammer had some kind of additional power that he hadn't felt before. It didn't feel as dangerous as Astor's attack, but it had a unique feeling of danger to it. It simply felt different.\nBANG!\nSarah's eyes widened.\nShang had just kicked the underside of her hammer!\nThe sound of cracking bone could be heard, but thanks to Shang's power, he managed to divert the hammer. Its trajectory changed, barely missing Shang's lowered head.\nThen, Shang slashed towards Sarah's extended arm, the one holding the hammer. As long as he could get rid of that, he would win.\nHowever, Shang had to stop his attack again. Sarah had managed to put her other hand in the way again, and Shang couldn't afford to lose his weapon.\nWhen Sarah saw that Shang had stopped his attack, she followed the swing of her hammer and put more power into it, pulling it around again to attack Shang.\nBANG!\nShang kicked the side of the hammer again, breaking more of his bones. Luckily, thanks to his warrior's body, he regenerated the injuries rather quickly.\nHowever, bones needed a lot of Mana to regenerate, and Shang's Mana was close to being depleted. If he made that move again, he would have to fight with broken bones.\nBANG!\nSarah's hammer landed on the ground beside Shang, shaking the earth.\nAt this moment, Shang's mind was going wild.\n'Her left arm is still free. I can't attack her hammer since my sword keeps telling me that it will be destroyed as soon as it touches it. I can't attack her right arm because her left arm is threatening my sword. As long as her left arm is free, I can't attack her with my sword.'\n'Her entire fighting style is about countering weapons. Her right arm unleashes devastating and long-reaching attacks. That makes it nearly impossible to evade the normal way. I have to use something to divert the force, which will slowly exhaust me.'\n'At the same time, her left arm is a perfect defense, keeping all weapons away from her.'\nAnd then, Shang got an idea.\nShang slashed towards Sarah's right arm again, and just as predicted, her left arm quickly extended towards Shang's sword.\nAnd then, Shang flicked his sword to the side.\nThe eyes of the watching students widened in surprise. Shang was throwing his weapon away?\nAstor, who had just finished his second fight, also looked with surprise at Shang.\nTeacher Loran frowned.\nShang grabbed Sarah's left hand and pulled her forward with all of his power.\nSarah lost her balance, and Shang stepped to the side until he was behind her.\nThen, Shang jumped up. He put his legs around her torso and his arms around her head from behind.\nBANG!\nAt least, he wanted to. However, before he could, Shang felt a force push him to the side, throwing him several meters away.\nSarah's eyes remained open in surprise. She knew what would happen, but for some reason, Shang's attack never came.\nAfter a bit of confusion, she turned around to see Shang on the ground a couple of meters away.\nRight now, teacher Loran was standing behind her.\n\"Are you stupid?!\" teacher Loran shouted with annoyance at Shang. \"This is a lesson, not a competition! You are supposed to learn from each other, not do everything in your ability to win!\"\n\"What's the point of winning when you don't learn anything?! You can do that stuff when you have to win no matter what, but you're here to learn!\"\nShang only now managed to stand up, and a look of annoyance was on his face. \"Well, what am I supposed to do? Her left arm destroys my weapon. Her weapon destroys my weapon. By forcing me to only use my sword, you are forcing me to fight with a handicap.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"That is a handicap of your own making,\" teacher Loran said with a snort. \"Our weapons are just as important as our bodies and techniques. All of you have enough power to earn enough money to increase the power of your weapons. If you have a weak weapon, that's your own fault.\"\n\"Great, but I haven't had any time to upgrade my weapon yet!\" Shang said with frustration. \"How am I supposed to gain experience when I can't even use my weapon? All of my attacks and defenses are unusable since my weapon will be destroyed in one exchange!\"\n\"So? You don't have to sacrifice your weapon,\" teacher Loran said. \"This is about learning, not winning. If you have such a problem, use the fights to train your defensive capabilities. So what if you can't win? Being able to live longer under a barrage can be a viable way to win since the opponent might become exhausted before you, giving you an opening.\"\nShang gritted his teeth in frustration.\nHe definitely didn't like it, but there was some truth to teacher Loran's words. This fight was not about winning but about gaining experience.\nWhat had Shang learned during that fight?\nNot much.\nHow much had he learned during Astor's fight?\nA lot!\n\"Teacher, I think you're treating Shang unjustly.\"\nTeacher Loran frowned and turned to Sarah.\nSarah had been the one that had said that just now.\nShang looked over with a raised eyebrow.\n\"He might not have learned much, but I have,\" she said as she looked at the ground with furrowed brows. \"I thought that my defense was perfect, but Shang has shown me a huge flaw. With all my experience, I should be the one to win. However, I didn't.\"\n\"That's because he counters my fighting style. My fighting style revolves all around dealing with the weapons and armor of my enemies. However, if the enemy has no weapons or armor and is still a threat, I'm fumbling around blindly.\"\nWhen teacher Loran heard that, he scratched the side of his chin in thought.\n\"Like a beast?\" he asked.\nSarah furrowed her brows. \"Yes, like a beast. I haven't fought many beasts before. I nearly almost only fight humans.\"\nTeacher Loran hummed to himself for a bit.\nThen, he turned to Shang. \"You know what? I might have judged too early,\" he said. \"Sure, you didn't learn anything, but you allowed Sarah to learn from you. So, the fight still hasn't been useless.\"\nShang looked at Sarah with surprise. He had expected her to complain, but that wasn't the case. Instead of thinking that Shang had won with unfair methods, she had accepted it. In her mind, she had just lost the battle.\nThat was an admirable quality.\n\"Alright, if you're both fine with it, you can continue,\" teacher Loran said before turning to the class again.\nShang and Sarah looked at each other.\nOne had nearly no experience in fighting with humans.\nThe other had nearly no experience in fighting with beasts.\nOne had fought many humans.\nOne had fought many beasts.\nThey could definitely benefit from each other's knowledge.",

      "content": "Chapter 105 Beast\nTeacher Loran continued the lesson and called for the next people to start fighting. He let Sarah and Shang do whatever they wanted. Sarah had said that she learned a lot from Shang, which meant that Shang was an appropriate sparring partner for her.\nUnder normal circumstances, Shang should lose to someone of Sarah's level. However, Shang's experience in fighting barehanded made him the perfect counter to Sarah.\nOne had to remember that something like this wasn't normal. Basically, all warriors focused on their weapons, and they definitely didn't have much experience in serious hand-to-hand combat.\nYes, the students often beat each other up in a fistfight, but that was it.\nIt was a fistfight.\nThey punched and kicked each other, but they generally didn't grapple. They were so used to fighting with their weapons that they used their fists and legs as weapons. That meant striking the enemy with them.\nIf someone else had managed to get behind Sarah, they would have most likely unleashed a fist strike or a kick. Sarah would have been injured and thrown away, but she would have had a chance to turn things around.\nAnd even if they tried to grapple Sarah from the back, there would have been a high likelihood that Sarah would have somehow managed to either smash their face in with the back of her head or managed to wriggle out of it.\nHowever, Shang had been an MMA fighter on Earth. He knew exactly how he had to grab her. By putting his legs around her torso, shaking him off would have proven basically impossible. Her arms also wouldn't have been able to deal much damage, and her hammer could have only been swung in a very awkward manner.\nThe way Shang fought with his bare hands was very strange for this world. It was basically completely unknown.\nIn a way, one could say that Shang fought like a beast without his weapon. Beasts also often used their claws to grab an opponent and then use their teeth to kill them. When a beast wanted to kill someone, it didn't just swipe forward with its claws. No, swiping with their claws was mostly a defensive maneuver.\nWhen a beast wanted to genuinely kill someone, it dug its claws into the opponent to keep them close and to position them perfectly for the finishing bite. Being caught by the claws was a death sentence most of the time, but not always. With enough experience, one could potentially turn things around.\nSarah and Shang began talking after teacher Loran turned his focus to the remaining class.\nSarah told Shang that she was interested in learning how to fight against beasts and unarmed opponents, which was why she asked him to fight without a weapon.\nHowever, she also knew that Shang would basically not learn much, which would make this lesson an affair with only one beneficiary.\n\"In exchange, you can ask me whatever you want. I know a lot about politics, materials, resources in general, and weapons,\" she offered.\nShang realized that the offer was pretty good. The teachers had a lot to do, and he could probably only ask these questions at the end of lessons. Additionally, several teachers didn't specialize in the things Sarah knew. For example, teacher Loran didn't even know what a Sparren was, which counted as a gem and material.\nSarah's fighting style was specialized for countering weapons, which meant that she also had to learn a lot about materials and weapons. If she didn't know everything about her opponent's weapons, she would put herself in severe danger.\n\"I accept,\" Shang said.\nSarah nodded. \"Then, after every session, you can ask me questions for ten minutes.\"\nShang nodded. \"Deal.\"\nAfter that, Sarah readied her hammer again.\nShang put his sword to the side. At this moment, Shang's sword was useless. If it touched Sarah's left hand or weapon, it would be destroyed. Because of that, it was literally better for Shang to fight barehanded.\nSo, the two of them began fighting again.\nHow did the fights go?\nHorrible.\nFor Sarah, that is.\nThe biggest reason why Sarah couldn't win was her hammer.\nIt simply wasn't sharp.\nBecause of that, Shang could afford to kick, push, and punch it away. Yes, the power of the hammer still broke his bones, but that wasn't an issue. Shang's superior body gave him the ability to throw such a heavy weapon as Sarah's hammer away. If Shang's body were as powerful as Sarah's body, he wouldn't have that ability.\nHowever, that was exactly the reason why Shang was able to essentially act as a beast. In the earlier levels of the Soldier Stage, the difference in physical power between a human and a beast wasn't that great. One could almost call them as being on the same level.\nBut everything changed in the Peak Soldier Stage. That was the first level when a beast's body became quite a bit more powerful than a human's body.\nAnd things would only get worse at the General Stage.\nThe power of beasts' bodies continued to escalate the stronger they became.\nWhy?\nBecause that was the only way they could fight humans. The beasts that didn't have those powerful bodies had long since died out. Starting at the General Stage, a beast was a genuine threat to a warrior.\nIn the Commander Stage, beasts won far more fights against warriors than they lost. Of course, that was assuming a one-on-one duel without one party using a surprise attack.\nIn reality, most warriors remained hidden when they were hunting a beast. They would only attack when the beast didn't pay attention. Additionally, many hunters worked in pairs or teams.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ In an open one-on-one duel, most warriors in the General and Commander Stage would lose against a beast of an equivalent level.\nWhy?\nBecause warriors fought mostly with their bodies and beasts did too, and beasts had far more powerful bodies.\nIt often ended with a beast getting cut by a sword, the sword getting stuck in a bone, and the beast biting down on the warrior, killing them.\nHowever, that only counted for warriors, not humans as a whole.\nThere were still the Mages, and those fights went very differently.\nA true Mage didn't have any issues in taking down a beast of an equivalent level. They simply readied their spells and unleashed them on the charging beast.\nMost of the time, the beast would be dead before it even reached the Mage. On top of that, Mages weren't stupid. They knew that they were at their weakest when their opponent was close. Because of that, it was imperative for all Mages to learn plenty of Spells and skills to gain distance.\nIf the beast didn't have an amazing long-ranged ability, the only way to win was to exhaust the Mage's Mana, which took quite a long time.\nBeasts were mostly helpless in front of Mages, just like warriors.\nThis was not a rock-paper-scissors scenario.\nMages just straight-up dominated all the classes.\nBeing the strongest warrior on a level meant being a slightly above-average Mage in terms of Battle-Strength.\nHowever, that only counted for the General Stage and up.\nIn the First Realm, the Soldier Stage, the two sides were still about equal.\nThe important part in all of this was that beasts were very dangerous to warriors, and that was why Sarah wanted to learn from Shang how to fight them.\nSarah lost every single fight, but she wasn't distraught. She knew that Shang was essentially fighting like a beast, and he also had the physical power of a beast.\nAs the lesson continued, Sarah managed to last longer and longer.\nShe was using her hammer less as a weapon to end the fight instantly but as a means to keep Shang at an appropriate distance from her. Shang's weakness was that he couldn't directly block the hammer. He had to evade or parry it.\nEvery time Sarah managed to force Shang to block, he would accumulate injuries.\nHowever, one wrong move from Sarah and the fight would end.\nThis meant that Sarah had to be perfect, and she had to anticipate every single potential move Shang could make.\nIf she were fighting a beast, that wouldn't be so hard, but she was essentially fighting a human in the body of a beast. Shang had a lot of creativity in his fighting style.\nSo, when teacher Loran ended the lesson after three hours, Sarah still hadn't won a single time.",

      "content": "Chapter 106 Weapons\nAt the end of the lesson, teacher Loran informed all the students about stuff he had noticed during the fights. He informed them where they had made a mistake and where they should have performed better.\nThat also included Shang.\n\"I can't say much about your fight with Sarah, but I can give you some feedback on your fight with Astor,\" teacher Loran said.\nShang nodded.\n\"Ignoring the first fight, in your second fight, you haven't paid any attention to your surroundings. The ground is rather hard here, but it isn't unbreakable. The academy could have made the ground unbreakable for Soldier Stage warriors, but that wouldn't reflect a realistic battlefield.\"\n\"You might have also noticed that the training field isn't without obstacles,\" teacher Loran said as he pointed to a column near the edge of the arena.\nShang looked over and saw a column about a meter wide and two meters high. It was made of an unknown material that looked a bit like metal.\n\"The edge of the training field belongs to the training field, and these columns are included. They have been placed in the arena as obstacles. In your fight against Astor, you should have realized that his sword needs a lot of room to swing.\"\n\"Usually, being with your back against a wall is a bad idea, but if it's only a column, it can help you. Astor would have only been able to attack you with the tip of his sword and not the entire thing if the column was right behind you. If he extended too much and you stepped to the side, his sword would hit the column and bounce off or crack it, essentially robbing him of all his momentum.\"\n\"Additionally, you could have moved around it and use several stabs from the sides. Eventually, Astor would need to step away from that place and gain distance. At the moment when he steps away, you should use the column as a foothold to throw yourself at him to continue the fight with you on the offensive. If your offensive gets broken, retreat to the column.\"\n\"Another good way to win the fight is to retreat when Astor releases his swing. Every swing of his takes a lot of power and drains his stamina considerably. You have the advantage in speed, and by jumping in and out, you can exhaust him. Of course, you can't allow yourself to make any mistakes. If Astor sees your feint, he will use his swing to further his momentum instead of using it.\"\n\"When you closed in on Astor, you noticed that he is very good at defending his vital points. Attacking someone's vital points is a big undertaking and will leave you open if you fail. Astor only has to hit you once to win the weapon due to his sheer power.\"\n\"Usually, going for the kill is the quickest way to end the fight, but the quickest way isn't always the safest or best way. When you slid beneath Astor's sword, you shouldn't have tried to attack his heart but his legs. You could have tried to flee beneath his legs to avoid his strike. He has a lot of power and great defense, but his flexibility is a weakness that you have to exploit.\"\nShang took note of all of teacher Loran's lessons, and he learned a lot.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Earlier, he had thought that he had already lost after falling for Astor's feint, but there had actually been a way out. Now, Shang knew what he could have done.\n\"As you've seen, Mattheo is using pressure and relentless offense to deal with Astor. You don't have the ability yet to release such an explosive offense, which is why you should avoid doing that. Instead, try to win in the long run by slowly exhausting and injuring him to death.\"\n\"Of course, all of this is theory, and I only gave you a way to fight better against the abilities Astor has shown. He has plenty more abilities for all kinds of situations, but you have to see them for yourself for when you manage to actually put up a proper fight against him.\"\n\"In this class, you learn about how to deal with opponents. That's why I'm explaining to you what you should have done in your fight. If you want feedback on your specific techniques, you should enter Mervin's lesson. He's the teacher for sword techniques.\"\nAfter teacher Loran said that, he went to the next student without even waiting to see if Shang had any questions.\nShang had noticed that teacher Loran also hadn't given any other student the chance to ask questions. It seemed like he wasn't a fan of answering questions.\nAfter giving every student their feedback, teacher Loran left the training field rather quickly, leaving the students alone.\nAstor left rather quickly. He seemed busy.\nMattheo talked and laughed with a couple of other students and left with them.\nElver, the green-haired boy that insulted Shang, looked at Shang, snorted, and walked away without saying anything.\n\"So, your questions?\" Sarah asked Shang with a neutral voice.\nShang hadn't seen Sarah smile yet. Even when she had proclaimed her excitement at learning new things, her face hadn't shown even a hint of a smile. It was like she was serious 24/7.\n\"You have a Metal Affinity, correct?\" Shang asked.\nSarah nodded. \"Yes. Please keep your questions about my person as infrequent as possible,\" she answered flatly.\nShang nodded. \"I wanted to know since I am most interested in your knowledge of metals, materials, and weapons.\"\n\"That makes sense,\" Sarah answered. \"Your weapon is your biggest weakness currently. What do you want to know?\"\n\"What kind of ore should I use to create a stronger weapon?\" Shang asked.\n\"Depends on your Affinity and your control over it,\" Sarah answered. \"There are weapons that can gain additional power with certain Affinities as long as they are made of the correct materials and by an experienced blacksmith.\"\nShang wasn't sure what he should say regarding his Affinity.\nShould he say he didn't have one? In that case, he wouldn't know what he should do with his weapon.\nShould he say he had one? In that case, questions would appear about what kind of Affinity Shang had.\nSarah noticed Shang's hesitation with a neutral expression. \"Both it is then.\"\nShang felt a bit guilty for having to keep this a secret. \"Thanks,\" he silently said.\n\"If you don't have an Affinity, it's simple. The more powerful the metal, the better,\" Sarah explained. \"However, you have to pay attention to what kind of powerful metal you buy.\"\n\"Your sword is rather thin, which means it needs metal that can bend by a bit. Going all-in on hardness could get problematic since that would make it easier for your sword to break.\"\n\"However, all of that isn't an issue. All the different merchants selling ore know what they are doing. As long as they can see your weapon, they know what kind of ore you should get. Of course, I'm only referring to the good and professional merchants. Don't expect good service from someone that sells ore for cheap. You might get unsuitable ore.\"\nShang nodded.\n\"As for Affinities, that's a bit more complex. In terms of a Pure Affinity, it isn't much of an issue. You simply want a metal that has the same Affinity as your Affinity and the fitting characteristics for your weapon.\"\n\"If you have an Impure Affinity, which is a mixed Affinity created out of two or more Pure Affinities, you will have it much harder. However, the issue with creating such a weapon isn't the materials but the blacksmith. You need a blacksmith that can smelt metals of different Affinities together, and those blacksmiths are very expensive.\"\n\"If you have the luck to run across a fitting piece of ore with an Impure Affinity, you can also give that to the blacksmith. However, those kinds of ores are very rare and very valuable. They are outside your price range as long as you are a Soldier Stage warrior.\"\n\"As for the uses of weapons with Affinities, they can store and unleash Mana. In the Soldier Stage, that is not something you can freely use during a fight since we lack the amount of Mana to make our Affinities powerful enough to deal actual damage.\"\n\"We need to store the Mana in the weapon before the fight over a long period of time, and we can unleash the stored Mana during that fight. In that way, we can unleash an elemental attack with power far above our usual output.\"\n\"You've seen Mattheo fight. All the explosions around him come from the stored Mana in his gauntlets. He's releasing them in a controlled manner to increase his speed and power. He could have also unleashed everything at once in a big explosion, but that would have injured him too.\"\n\"Additionally, that doesn't work against Astor. He already tried it before.\"\n\"And the ten minutes are up. See you next time,\" Sarah said before turning around to leave.\nShang blinked a couple of times.\nThat was already ten minutes?\nBut… where could he get the money for that ore?\nWhere should he buy it?\nCould he get it cheaper somewhere?\nDid Sarah know of specific ore Shang could use?\nShang still had so many questions.\nBut in the end, Shang only sighed. 'Well, I only fought with her for one lesson. If I got all my questions answered immediately, it would be a bit bad.'\n'Anyway, I learned a lot about Affinities and weapons. At least I know what I should pay attention to and what these kinds of weapons can do.'\nShang looked at the empty training field for one long moment.\nJust one lesson.\nShang had learned so much in just one lesson.\nSure enough, it had been the correct decision to join the Warrior's Academy.",

      "content": "Chapter 107 Plan\nShang slowly walked away from the training field, scratching his chin as he thought about how he should proceed.\n'My goal is obviously power. To get there, I need to increase my Battle-Strength since I can't work on my level right now. To increase my Battle-Strength, I need more experience. I'm very good at fighting against beasts, and I'm more than fine with Battle-Strength in that regard.'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ 'So, logically, I should work on my Battle-Strength against humans. However, the issue is that I can't even properly fight other humans since my weapon gets destroyed with basically every attack. So, the first priority should be my weapon.'\n'Sarah has taught me a lot about Affinities and weapons, and I'm pretty confident that I should get ore fitting for my Affinity.'\n'Now, the question is, how do I have to combine the ore to make it work? If I were to combine the four different Affinities I have that I know of, do I need to get one-quarter of each, or do I need to get a full load of each?'\nShang wanted to look at his sword, but he remembered that he wasn't allowed to pull it out without a very good reason.\n'That's the issue. Do I need all of it or just a bit? I mean, the logical first step would be to buy two units of ore with a Fire, Ice, Light, and Darkness Affinity. If that still isn't enough, I can simply buy more.'\n'Luckily, my weapon isn't simple, and I don't need a blacksmith. The God gave me the weapon precisely due to the absence of powerful blacksmiths at the higher levels. He said it's too much to force me to blaze two paths at once. So, according to him, I don't need a blacksmith. I probably only need to put my sword close to the ore.'\n'Can my sword handle multiple Affinities? Oh, why am I even asking? I think the God thought of that. I don't think that something like that is too hard for him.'\n'So, first step, get two Units of ore for everything, and to get there, I need money or Contribution Points.'\n'I still need to ask Sarah where I can get the ore relatively cheap, but that has to wait for the next lesson, which should be in two days.'\n'Then, I should earn money and Contribution Points until then.'\nShang walked back to the main building and entered his room. Then, he checked the map in the rulebook again for all the different boards for missions.\nThe exchange hall had the mission board for escort missions and transportation missions.\nThe main gate had missions that took place in Warrior's Paradise. Those missions often consisted of someone renting a student for a specific amount of time. It was often for research or for teaching, as in that the student taught the person that submitted the mission.\nThose missions didn't give that many rewards. After all, there were plenty of students that wanted to earn Contribution Points without risking their lives in the outside. Due to the great number of students willing to accept these missions, the rewards were very low. After all, even if 99% of students wouldn't accept a mission with such low rewards, 1% would still accept it.\nThe main building had a mission board that offered missions coming from different Zones and even other countries. Nearly all of these missions came from the countries themselves or directly from the army.\nThe Soldier Stage students were just that in the army, students. Sure, they were powerful inside the Soldier Stage, but actual armies used General Stage warriors.\nWhat would the students be used for?\nAssistance, low-ranking guards, transportation.\nUnimportant jobs.\nSo, why ask for students?\nTwo reasons.\nFirst of all, the army could pay the students in recognition and knowledge. This meant that the army didn't need to pay a lot for their help. Students also didn't mind the low rewards since they would learn a lot and also get acquainted with a couple of officers in the army. That would make it far easier to join the army in the future.\nSecond, the students from this academy had a bright future ahead of them, and by having them inside their army for a while, the likelihood of a student joining said army would increase.\nShang remembered that one female officer he had met in Blizzard's Edge. She had said that she was also part of the Warrior's Academy. Shang had wondered why she was there, but now it made sense. She had probably accepted one of these missions.\n'Wait a sec,' Shang suddenly thought as he realized something. 'She was in the General Stage, right? And she said that she was part of the Warrior's Academy, right?'\n'So, does that mean that she is part of that special training program? Additionally, she is obviously a member of the ones with the blue uniforms, the ones that want to become officers in the future.'\nShang blinked a couple of times.\n'Wow, back then, I thought that basically all the students in this academy were outstanding, but she's in a league of her own. She's probably well on her way to the Commander Stage.'\n'Huh, I guess I met a future knight. Who woulda thought?'\n'Anyway, back to the missions. I think I should accept some of the missions near the north of the academy.'\nWhat missions were in the north?\nBeast hunting.\nBeast hunting gave a lot of rewards, and Shang wouldn't need to travel very far. After all, Warrior's Paradise was just a stone's throw away from the wilderness.\nHowever, the missions were dangerous. Going alone into the wilderness could end in tragedy. Just one wrong move and one might actually stumble across a beast they couldn't defeat. Only confident hunters accepted these missions, and they often went in pairs as insurance.\nBut for Shang, these missions were perfect.\nShang left the room and walked towards the south first. When he arrived at the market, Shang bought a couple of beast sacks. Teacher Mervin had delivered the corpse of the Pest Cat, which included the beast sack.\nWhen Shang asked for beast sacks, he simply got several of them handed to him, free of charge.\nThe academy wanted to encourage people to hunt beasts, which was why the beast sacks were free.\nAfter getting his beast sacks, Shang went towards the north. He walked past the training fields until he reached an area close to the city walls.\nThere, he saw a big board with plenty of missions hanging on it.\nThen, Shang looked at the missions.",

      "content": "Chapter 108 Beast Missions\nThe mission board was absolutely filled with missions. The other mission boards couldn't compare at all to this one, which made sense.\nWarrior's Paradise was a gigantic city fully focused on economy. People from all over the world came here to get rare materials from rare beasts, and the reason why Warrior's Paradise could get these rare materials was its very location.\nIt was in the middle of three differently ranked wildernesses.\nOf course, the most important was the Canyon. The Canyon housed many beasts in the Third Realm, and those were the desirable ones for the city and the people visiting it.\nHowever, to keep such a high-ranked wilderness healthy, there had to be lower-ranked wildernesses in its vicinity. A beast in the Third Realm couldn't just have its children in such a highly ranked wilderness.\nAfter all, how will the beasts learn to fend for themselves and become more powerful? This wasn't Earth where it was natural for a beast to reach the power of its parents.\nNo, the offspring of a beast in the Third Realm would barely reach the Initial Second Realm before it counted as fully grown. At that point, it needed to become more powerful by hunting powerful beasts.\nBecause of that, basically all offspring of the truly powerful beasts were sent to an area filled with beasts in the First Realm. The offspring still had a definite advantage in the First Realm since it came from such a powerful bloodline, but that would change in the Second Realm.\nThat was why these lower-ranked wildernesses acted as a training ground for the offspring of powerful beasts. The offspring would learn to fight in these areas, and they would have to truly prove themselves in areas housing beasts in the Second Realm.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ And only when they managed to get through all the other beasts could they go to the Canyon.\nSo, even though the Canyon was the most important wilderness around Warrior's Paradise, it couldn't exist without the Wasteland and the Wild Forest. Without these two, new beasts in the Third Realm would become extremely rare, and Warrior's Paradise would inevitably eradicate the powerful beasts.\nHowever, the Wild Forest and the Wasteland still needed a lot of maintenance.\nFirst of all, the beast population had to be kept in place, or the beasts would start spilling over into the other wildernesses or even attack the Farm Line.\nSecond, there were several beast kinds that specifically hunted talented young beasts, and those were bad for Warrior's Paradise for obvious reasons. No talented offspring, no new Third Realm beasts.\nAnd since there were three wildernesses around Warrior's Paradise, the missions regarding beasts were insanely numerous.\n'Capture a newborn Spear Stork,' Shang read in his mind when he saw one particular mission.\nThis mission had caught his eye due to the familiar name.\n'Spear Stork. That was the kind of bird that was killed by the ballista when I first arrived here. Teacher Loran said that it was in the Third Realm, the Commander Stage,' Shang remembered.\n'Capture it? Why? The mission has been submitted by the Mana Austerum based on the mission slip. Well, I guess something like a Spear Stork has an Affinity for Wind. Maybe the Mana Austerum wants to study it?'\n'Also, what's that reward? Four training slips? Is that for the special training, or what's that for? I should ask later.'\nShang looked over the other missions as well.\nNearly all the missions were about killing certain beasts, but there were also a couple of missions that wanted materials. For these missions, it didn't matter how one obtained these materials.\nOf course, the reason why these missions even existed was that they were either cheaper to get from the academy or they were simply not available. Therefore, accepting the mission, buying them, and submitting them would be a net loss. If that worked, the submitter of the mission would have done that themselves.\n'Lots of special beasts I have never heard of,' Shang thought. 'I don't even know what a Doomeye Lizard is. Also, what the hell is a Grimface?'\nAfter looking at the missions for a while, Shang noticed an issue.\nHe had no idea what kind of beasts the missions wanted. Sure, he had the name, but he needed a description of their features, at least.\nIt was important to know which beasts could be hunted and which couldn't. Sure, around 90% of beasts were free to be killed by everyone, but the 10% that were forbidden from being hunted were important.\nIf the city noticed that someone had hunted a beast on the blacklist, the hunter would need to give up the corpse and pay a hefty fine. This meant that the hunter had literally risked their life to pay a hefty fine.\n'Well, seems like I should stay with the base missions for now,' Shang thought as he looked to a smaller board to the side.\nBase missions were different from normal missions. Normal missions were individual missions that had been submitted by a client. Base missions, on the other hand, were directly given by the academy itself.\nThose missions also had descriptions of the targets on them.\nShang looked at the base mission at the top.\n'Eradicate all Pest Cats. Makes sense,' Shang thought. 'Wait! 21 Contribution Points? I'm pretty sure that someone like teacher Mervin wouldn't steal a single Contribution Point from a student. So, does that mean that the reward has increased in the last couple of days?'\nShang looked over the mission and noticed that he didn't need to register for that mission. Usually, someone needed to register for a mission if they wanted to accept it. The registering process would then lock the mission to that person, which stopped two people from going out to do the same mission.\nBut for these base missions, registering wasn't necessary.\nWhy?\nBecause there was no limit to the number of targets. No matter how many corpses one brought, the academy would reward each and every one of them.\nSpeaking of corpses, Shang noticed that he didn't actually need to bring over the entire corpse for the reward. He only needed to bring two Pest Cat ears as proof.\nSomething interesting Shang noticed was that the eradication of the Pest Cats wasn't the only base mission, and it also wasn't the only one without a target limit.\nThere were three more.\n'Swamp Millipede?' Shang thought as he looked at the next mission.\nThe first thing that caught Shang's eye was the reward.\n'50 Contribution Points!' Shang thought with interest.\nThen, he looked at the description.\n'A purplish-black millipede with a Poison Affinity. It transforms its nest and surroundings into a poisonous swamp, severely damaging the plants and ruining the forest. They can be found in the northeastern Wild Forest,' Shang read in his mind.\n'Poison Affinity?' Shang thought with furrowed brows, but a bit later, he realized something.\n'The Empress Cobra Zone is to the northeast, and teacher Mervin said that the Empress Cobra has a Poison Affinity. I guess this is an invasive species.'\nShang continued reading.\n'Huh, they are at the same level as Pest Cats generally, which is the Middle Soldier Stage, but they have elemental abilities, which makes them more dangerous. That's also why they are worth more.'\n'I should keep an eye out for them.'\nThen, Shang looked at the next mission.\n'Life Scarab? That doesn't really sound dangerous,' Shang thought while reading the mission.\n'Interesting. They find a tree and bind with it. Then, they absorb the light in the surroundings and infuse the tree with lots of Mana. The tree wildly mutates, which usually results in it destroying the other plants around it and becoming quite powerful. After the mutation, the tree is subservient to the light scarab.'\n'One of the major reasons why they are a huge problem is that they don't kill to feed. They basically kill everything that comes close to them, no matter what it is. However, without the Life Scarab, the tree will quickly die.'\n'200 Contribution Points as a reward since the tree usually exhibits power in the Late Soldier Stage. They can be found in the northwestern forest.'\n'As it stands right now, I should go to the northwestern forest. There are simply more rewards there. However, I should look at the last mission first.'\nShang looked at the last mission, and his eyes widened.\n'Vanishing Snake.'\n'2,000 Contribution Points!'",

      "content": "Chapter 109 Vanishing Snake\n'Vanishing Snake: In life trouble, in death trouble,' Shang read in his mind with surprise.\nWhy surprise?\nBecause 2,000 Contribution Points was a lot!\nWith just one snake, Shang could buy one unit of ore.\nShang definitely was interested in the big reward.\n'Descendants of General Stage beasts. However, the General Stage variant only lives in swampy areas. The powerful adult Vanishing Snakes put their young in the Wild Forest, and the young remain there until they become powerful enough to go back to the Empress Cobra Zone.'\n'The Vanishing Snakes are atypical snakes due to their teeth. In comparison to normal snakes, Vanishing Snakes don't have poisonous teeth but a full set of sharp fangs.'\n'The Vanishing Snakes have a Metal Affinity, and with their sharp teeth, they infuse their prey with the destructive power of metal, making the insides of their prey bleed furiously.'\n'The Vanishing Snakes are a menace in three ways.'\n'One: They are experts at assassination, and they are not afraid of humans. The Vanishing Snake is the beast that kills the most Soldier Stage hunters each year in the Storm Eagle Zone.'\n'Two: Vanishing Snakes can birth offspring after their death. In their lives, Vanishing Snakes will procreate with one partner, and the female Vanishing Snake will store the fertilized eggs until she dies unless she reaches the General Stage and finds a good spot.'\n'When the eggs get into contact with stomach acid, they come out of hibernation and start growing. The eggshells are sticky and will stick to the lining of the stomach. Eventually, the young will eat the target that has eaten their mother from the inside out.'\n'Three: The Vanishing Snake has access to a gas that causes targets to fall into a deep sleep. During combat, the effects of this gas are negligible, but if a Vanishing Snake manages to sneak up on someone without their notice, it can have devastating results.'\n'Humans will very quickly realize that the sudden onset of tiredness is unnatural, but beasts won't. Vanishing Snakes are not very big, and they can move very silently, hence the name.'\n'With the sleeping gas, the Vanishing Snake is one of the very few beasts that can take down beasts a Realm above them.'\n'There have been cases of Vanishing Snakes killing the guarding dogs in the Farm Line.'\nShang's eyes opened wide.\nHe still remembered the dogs he had seen in the Farm Line. Even now, Shang was very certain that he couldn't kill one of them. They were simply too fast and powerful.\nHowever, with the sleeping gas, the Vanishing Snakes could even kill these dogs.\nAfter having read all of this, Shang realized why the reward was that massive.\nThis thing was the biggest danger to Warrior's Paradise out of all beasts in the First Realm.\nIt was probably also responsible for a lot of deaths among the students.\n'It's also in the northeastern part of the Wild Forest,' Shang thought. 'So, to summarize, Pest Cats are everywhere, Life Scarabs are in the northwest, and Swamp Millipedes and Vanishing Snakes are in the northeast.'\nThat was when Shang realized something else.\n'Swamp Millipedes and Vanishing Snakes? The mission said that adult Vanishing Snakes only live in the Empress Cobra Zone. However, if the Swamp Millipedes manage to turn the northeastern Wild Forest into a swamp, even the adults will come here.'\n'It's almost like the poisonous swamp of the Empress Cobra Zone wants to expand. In comparison, the northwestern forest has it easier. Sure, they have the Life Scarabs, but they can't compare to the Vanishing Snakes in terms of threat to the environment and humans.'\n'I think I should go to the northeastern Wild Forest since the reward is higher, but it's also more dangerous. I can deal with all kinds of beasts, but I can't deal with beasts I can't see.'\nShang scratched his chin in thought. He wondered if there was a way to find them.\nShang looked around at the other people. He had been standing here for quite a while, and a lot of people had come and gone from the mission board.\nAfter a while, Shang's eyes shone when he saw someone.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ It was a man in his late 20s. He didn't wear the silver uniforms of the teachers but a black uniform. The students with the black uniforms wanted to become hunters.\nQuick thinking people probably had already noticed something strange.\nA student in their late 20s?\nShouldn't someone like that be in the General Stage?\nAnd yes, this man was in the General Stage. However, he was also still a student. That meant that he was a member of the special training the academy offered.\n\"Excuse me,\" Shang said politely to the man.\n\"Hm?\" the man uttered as he looked at Shang. \"Yes?\"\n\"I'm planning on going to the northeastern forest for the first time. I wanted to ask if there is a way for me to find the Vanishing Snakes before they find me?\" Shang asked.\nThe man looked Shang up and down with a bored gaze. \"No, they're too good at hiding. You can only trust your instincts. If your instincts are telling you that you are in danger, you are in danger. React appropriately, and you will be fine.\"\n\"Thank you for your advice,\" Shang said politely.\n\"No problem,\" the man said. Then, he pulled down a mission for a General Stage beast and left in a bored manner.\n\"How did you do that?\"\nShang looked to his other side when he heard someone say that.\nIt was a student about 17 years old, and he wore a yellow uniform.\n\"Do what?\" Shang asked.\n\"Get Yiral to answer you,\" the student said with surprise.\n\"The guy just now?\" Shang asked.\nThe student nodded.\n\"I just asked.\"\nThat made the student frown.\n\"I've seen many people ask Yiral about the northeastern forest, but he always tells them that they shouldn't go there. He always says that they are too inexperienced and that they should go to the northwestern forest.\"\n\"But when you asked him, he answered.\"\nShang hadn't known that he had been treated differently from the other students just now, which surprised him a bit. After all, the guy had just answered a random question.\n\"I'm very experienced when it comes to beasts, and I have been in a wilderness for over six months without interruption before,\" Shang said. \"I guess he noticed that.\"\nThe student blinked a couple of times in shock and surprise. \"Six months in the wilderness?\"\nUsually, that student would never believe that. After all, how old was Shang? 15? Why would a 15-year-old stay in the wilderness for half a year?\nHowever, when he thought about how Yiral had just acted, he started to believe it. Obviously, Yiral was looking out for the younger students by telling them not to go to the northeastern forest, but when it came to Shang, he apparently felt like it wasn't necessary.\nThat meant that Yiral probably thought that Shang could go to the northeastern forest.\nAfter realizing that, the student tried to get acquainted with Shang, but Shang very quickly left.\nShang simply didn't want to be distracted from becoming stronger.\nAnd then, Shang left the academy.\nIt was time to go to the northeastern forest.",

      "content": "Chapter 110 Power Of Magic\nShang exited the academy for the first time on his own. He had only left it once before, which was when teacher Mervin took him to hunt the Pest Cat. Back then, Shang hadn't had the opportunity to look at the city properly during the daytime.\nWarrior's Paradise was bustling.\nThere were people everywhere, and the merchants put up stalls at nearly every corner of the road.\nAs Shang passed through the streets, he saw quite a big number of General Stage warriors. Most of them wore brown armor made of leather, and, surprisingly, many of them also wore cloaks made of Pest Cat fur.\nThe reason was obvious. During the night, the Pest Cats were great at hiding themselves, and the black cloaks could also be used by the hunters to hide.\nHowever, in comparison to Shang's cloak, which he wasn't wearing at the moment, their cloaks had been made with far more skill. Most of them wore their cloaks as capes. From what Shang could see, the hunters could pull on a string, which made the cloak pull together at the back, transforming it from a cloak into a cape.\n'I should buy one of those later,' Shang thought.\nSadly, while walking through the streets, Shang also noticed something else, and he definitely didn't like that.\nHe saw several weaker people avoid him. Some mothers were pushing their children away from him, and several men quietly put their hands over their sacks of money.\nAs soon as Shang noticed that, he got reminded of the words from that one guard near Duke Whirlwind's garden.\n'You keep acting like a shifty criminal. If you don't fix that, you will see women protect their children and men protect their money,' Shang remembered with frustration.\nSure enough, that had come to pass.\nShang could only sigh. 'I really should work on that. Otherwise, I will be questioned by nearly every guard I come across. Buying things will probably also be harder outside the academy.'\nShang also saw several Mages in the streets. Most of them simply ignored him, but there were a couple of them that threw Shang some annoyed glances.\nIf Shang weren't constantly scanning his surroundings out of habit, he wouldn't have noticed these glances.\nThose glances represented annoyance and a bit of disgust.\nShang didn't interact with the couple of Mages throwing these glances at him, but his expression became more and more annoyed.\n'Most of the Mages I met were very approachable, but obviously, not all of them are like this. There are bound to be some of them that look down on warriors.'\nWhen Shang came to the gates, he saw something quite surprising.\nHe saw someone jump off the street.\nOne had to remember that Warrior's Paradise was on top of a huge flat mountain in the middle of the Wasteland. If one jumped off the street, they would fall for nearly two kilometers.\nShang walked to the side and looked down.\nJust before the person hit the ground, the trajectory of their body suddenly curved toward the front. Then, after around a hundred meters, Shang noticed that they began to slow down. Eventually, they touched the ground with their feet and continued running.\nFor some reason, their fall had been converted into forward momentum.\n\"That's a wind talisman,\" a random guy walking on the street shouted to Shang. Obviously, he had noticed that this was the first time Shang had seen something like that.\n\"Wind talisman?\" Shang asked.\n\"Yeah. It absorbs the wind of the fall and releases it near the ground to stop the fall. Most experienced hunters around these parts use them,\" the person explained.\n\"Thank you for explaining,\" Shang shouted back.\n\"No problem. Have fun,\" the guy said as he continued to Warrior's Paradise.\nHowever, Shang didn't continue walking. Instead, he continued looking at the Wasteland.\nHe had never truly seen the Wasteland during the day.\nIt was chaos.\nThere were deep crevices and hills everywhere, and Shang could already see several beasts walking through the Wasteland. On top of that, the Wasteland was so large that Shang couldn't even see the end of it from this position.\nOne had to know that Shang could see nearly 40 kilometers into the distance from his current position, and he still couldn't see the end.\nAdditionally, from what Shang was seeing, the land didn't start curving or anything like on Earth.\nShang could see that it continued and continued until the blue color of the air eventually hid the distant lands, and even at that distance, the Wasteland didn't end.\nFrom up here, Shang could also see a couple of hunters fighting.\nShang had never seen a General Stage warrior fight before, and he was very interested in the fight.\nHowever, from this distance, it was basically impossible to make out anything specific. Shang only saw a couple of hunters jumping around a big beast.\nSuddenly, Shang's vision was pulled towards the left as he saw something glint in the distance.\nShang barely caught a glimpse of an explosion vanishing a couple of kilometers away.\nIn front of the explosion was someone with long red hair and red robes. Based on context clues, Shang guessed that they were a Mage, probably an Adept.\nAfter the smoke of the explosion cleared, Shang could see the body of a beast… or at least what remained of it.\nIt had been completely decimated.\nAfter looking at the corpse for a bit, Shang noticed something and looked over to the other battlefield.\nThen, he looked back at the corpse again.\n'That's the same beast!' Shang thought.\nBased on the color and the horns, Shang was sure that the two parties had fought the same kind of beast.\nHowever, while one side was still fighting with three warriors, the other side had simply unleashed one explosion to end the fight.\nFor the first time, Shang actually saw the difference between Mages and warriors with his own eyes. He had always heard about it, but he had never truly witnessed it himself.\nShang imagined the two parties fighting each other.\nThen, Shang remembered the explosion he had seen. He could still see a several-meter-wide crater.\nThat single explosion would probably end the fight if the hunters were gathered.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ After coming to that conclusion, Shang looked at the road beneath him.\nIt was made with Earth Magic.\nThen, he remembered the Wind Talisman that other hunter had used.\nThat was made with Wind Magic.\nShang looked at the city walls.\nMade with Earth Magic.\nShang looked at the gigantic Mana Austerum towering over the city.\nMagic.\nSpace Rings.\nMagic.\nEverything was made with Magic.\nShang had known that the Mages were the rulers of this world, but only now did he truly see the power of the Mages.\nThe warriors existed, and they could still reach quite a bit of power, but in the end, they were living in a world of Magic.\nThe Mages were the true rulers. Even the bastion that represented the most powerful warriors in the world, Warrior's Paradise, was essentially run by Mages. The Mages administrated the city and ruled it.\nYes, the dean was probably the most important figure inside Warrior's Paradise, but even he was probably subservient to Duke Whirlwind.\nWarrior's Paradise was owned by a Duke.\nIt wasn't even a King.\nShang hadn't thought about the Mages very much while he had traveled to Warrior's Paradise, but he had seen their signs and symbols of power along the way.\nThis world was ruled by Mages.\nFor quite some time, Shang wasn't sure how he should feel about this.",

      "content": "Chapter 111 Swamp Millipede\nAfter watching the Wasteland for a while, Shang left towards the northeastern forest. He ran down the street at a comfortable pace, and a couple of minutes later, Shang arrived at the place where the road met the actual ground.\nShang looked at the sun to check where it was currently. He knew that it was the afternoon, which meant that the sun was in the west.\n'Sure enough, the sun acts the same way in this world as it does on Earth. The road ends in the north, and the sun's currently left from where I am. I doubt I will come out of the Wild Forest before the day is over. I think I should spend the night in the eastern forest and try to hunt as many beasts as I can.'\nShang checked if he had everything he needed and went towards the northeast.\nThe Wild Forest stretched for nearly a hundred kilometers into the east and the west. After a hundred kilometers on either side, one would reach the next Zones. If one went towards the northwest, one would eventually reach the wilderness of the Ice Wyvern Zone, and if one went to the northeast, one would reach the wilderness of the Empress Cobra Zone.\nThe borders between the Farm Line and the Wild Forest had very few beasts due to the scouts and guarding dogs. If Shang wanted to hunt beasts, he would need to travel into the Wild Forest for quite a few kilometers.\nShang charged towards the northeast, and as soon as he reached the forest, he jumped onto a tree. Walking on the ground would attract the attention of several beasts.\nUsually, Shang wouldn't care about some beasts at the Soldier Stage, but the Wild Forest was under strict management. If Shang accidentally got noticed by a beast that he wasn't allowed to kill, it could become troublesome. After all, the leaders of Warrior's Paradise didn't care if a hunter was attacked by such a beast. The hunter was not allowed to kill it, even if they were attacked.\nShang jumped from tree to tree, and only a couple of minutes later, he saw the first beast.\nIt was an orange lizard with red eyes. It was about a meter tall and two meters long. A red frill could be seen around its neck.\n'I have no idea what kind of beast that is, but it doesn't feel dangerous,' Shang thought. 'From what I'm feeling, I think that beast is in the Middle Soldier Stage. Sadly, killing it would be a risk since I don't know if that thing is on the blacklist or not.'\nShang continued jumping from tree to tree as silently as he could, which wasn't easy. However, he had had enough practice.\nOn his journey, Shang also saw a huge brown boar and bird with a very imposing and angry-looking face.\nThe name of a beast immediately appeared in Shang's mind when he saw that bird.\n'Grimface,' Shang thought. 'I remember looking at a mission that was about a Grimface. I guess that bird is a Grimface, right? I mean, the face certainly fits.'\n'Sadly, I don't know what the client actually wants from the beast. Additionally, I didn't even accept the mission. I'm unsure if it's a problem if I kill the target before accepting the mission.'\nShang continued traveling toward the northeast for another hour. By jumping from tree to tree, Shang's speed had taken a considerable hit. At most, he was maybe ten kilometers into the forest.\nThat was when Shang found one of his targets.\nOn the ground in front of Shang was a one-meter-high and about ten-meter-long millipede. It was currently curled around a dying tree on the ground. The ground around it had sunken, and a smelly purple liquid was bubbling inside the sunken ground.\n'I guess that's a Swamp Millipede,' Shang thought. '50 Contribution Points for each. I only need to bring its two feelers to get the reward.'\nAt the moment, the Swamp Millipede was only moving slightly, which showed that it was alive. Luckily, it hadn't noticed Shang yet.\n'Middle Soldier Stage, just as the mission slip stated,' Shang thought. 'However, in comparison to Pest Cats, Swamp Millipedes have elemental attacks. I haven't fought something with a Poison Affinity yet, but I can imagine that being hit by poison can be troublesome. I think I should avoid a direct confrontation if I don't want my trip to be cut short.'\nShang slowly moved around the surrounding trees to check for the Swamp Millipede's head.\nSadly, even after a full round, Shang couldn't find it. 'I can see its tail and basically its entire body, but the head is nowhere to be seen. Well, I know where the tail is. So, I just have to follow the body until I can find its head.'\nShang looked again, and sure enough, he found the most likely location of the head.\n'Its head is inside the tree near the bottom. I can't hit it from the outside, but I can behead it.'\n'But there is an issue.'\nShang looked at the millipede's body with a frown. A big chunk of its body had curled around the place where its head entered the tree. From the side, it was impossible to hit its neck without cutting through its body.\nHowever, cutting through its body might not kill it, and it might release some poisonous gas or something similar. Because of that, Shang wanted to kill it in one strike.\n'I could hit it from above, but the dead tree is a bit far away. I also can't land on the dead tree since it will notice me. Do I really have to fight it head-on?'\nShang frowned as he tried to think of a way.\nSuddenly, Shang's eyebrows rose.\nThen, he looked at his left arm.\n'I haven't truly tried out my new abilities yet. I have a couple more blasts after meeting the dean. I wonder…'\n'Would that work?'\nSilence.\n'Well, I should try it.'\n'It shouldn't be able to feel the Mana since the Mana I give off with my abilities is not part of its Mixed Affinity.'\nShang went to a stable branch near the millipede's head's place and readied himself.\nThen, he jumped off.\nShang traveled into a long arc to gain more distance. He had to travel for nearly 15 meters, which was too much with only a jump.\nAfter around eight meters, Shang's momentum started to go downward. As it looked right now, he would probably land around three meters away from the millipede's body.\nWhoosh!\nShang pointed his left arm diagonally towards the ground behind him and used his Ice Blast.\nThe knockback of the Ice Blast pushed Shang forward and upward again, extending his jump.\nIn fact, the knockback was so powerful that Shang would hit the tree above the millipede.\nHowever, just before Shang hit the tree, he pointed his left arm towards the sky as he readied his sword with his right.\nWhoosh!\nA ton of hot wind came out of Shang's left arm.\nShang's forward and upward momentum was completely stopped as he shot straight towards the ground at incredible speeds.\nHe was directly above the millipede's neck!\nBANG!\nShang's body hit the millipede while his sword cut through its neck with ease.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ His plan had worked!\nShang heard some scratching and thrashing come from inside the tree, and the millipede below him was also thrashing around.\nShang quickly put his nearly destroyed left arm at the millipede's body and used his new ability with Darkness Affinity.\nShang felt his left arm being healed rapidly, and the body very quickly stopped moving.\nAfter a couple of seconds, the body below him shriveled up like it had lost all its life energy and water.\nShang remained on the Swamp Millipede's body for a while, looking at his left arm with furrowed brows.\nIt hadn't completely healed.\n'I absorbed the life energy of its entire body, but it wasn't even enough to heal my left arm all the way,' Shang thought.\n'Well, the Swamp Millipede was only in the Middle Soldier Stage. I guess that a more powerful beast would give me more life energy. Luckily, I easily have enough Mana in my body to heal the remaining injuries on my left arm.'\n'Oh, it stopped moving?' Shang thought as he noticed that he stopped hearing the sound of scrapping coming from inside the tree.\nShang stood up on the millipede's body and put his sword into the cut-off neck inside the dead tree.\nAfter that, Shang pulled the head out. It wasn't easy, but with enough force, it worked. The tree was dead anyway, so Shang didn't care if he damaged it.\nThe head came out, and Shang quickly cut off its two feelers.\nHowever, while cutting off the feelers, Shang got distracted by the hole in the dead tree.\nThen, his eyes widened.",

      "content": "Chapter 112 Hunting\nWhat did Shang see in the hole inside the dead tree?\nMore Swamp Millipedes, but smaller.\nNo wonder that thing had its head pointed into the dead tree. It was probably nursing its young.\nThe little Swamp Millipedes were only around half a meter long and quite thin. At the moment, Shang could see them squiggling around in a ball.\n'Lucky!' Shang thought with a grin. 'Those are at least ten, which means I get another 500 Contribution Points.'\nDid Shang feel bad about killing them?\nNo.\nFirst of all, they were a menace to nature, and second of all, they were insects. It was just natural for a human to feel less empathy for insects.\nShang looked at his left arm, which had healed by now.\nThen, Shang put his hand into the hole and pointed it at the ball.\nShang used his Ice Blast, and the ball froze over in an instant. Of course, Shang's arm nearly burned off, but he quickly saved it by using a Fire Blast in a random direction.\nHowever, his arm was still bleeding heavily, and it would need some time to heal. Luckily, the bone wasn't injured, which meant that Shang wouldn't need to use as much Mana.\nThe inherent Mana inside his body should heal the arm pretty quickly.\nA couple seconds later, Shang's arm was fully healed.\nHowever, his Mana was dangerously low.\nIn his spars against the other students, Shang had been able to heal his broken foot a couple of times, but that had only been a small foot. This time, it was his entire arm. His Mana had to heal way more mass.\nAfter healing his arm, Shang took out the frozen ball of Swamp Millipedes and put it inside his beast sack together with the feelers of the adult version.\n'That should be around 500 Contribution Points or something like that. Kind of hard to count how many young are inside the ball.'\n'Let's see. I need at least 2,000 Contribution Points per unit of ore since the cheapest Rank Two ore cost that much. However, since I need ore with specific Affinities, I will probably need more. Additionally, I need two units per Affinity.'\n'If I say that each unit of ore costs 3,500 since I have rare Affinities, I would need 28,000 Contribution Points.'\nShang took a deep breath when he finished his calculation.\n'So, this ball of Swamp Millipedes isn't even a fiftieth of what I need. Oh boy,' Shang thought.\n'That's a lot of work, but I think that's to be expected. The other students have been in the academy for over four years. Over four years, they have probably done a lot of missions.'\n'If they earned 100 Contribution Points per day, which is definitely possible, they could have easily earned way over 100,000 Contribution Points in four years. It's definitely possible to earn 28,000 Contribution Points, but it takes time and effort.'\nShang sighed.\n'I certainly don't like the thought of going into the wilderness every day to kill beasts that aren't even a danger to me, but I guess work isn't supposed to be fun. After all, it's work.'\n'Anyway, I should continue,' Shang thought as he put the beast sack over his shoulder. It was very light at the moment since nearly nothing was in it, but it was still a bit annoying to carry it around.\n'I need a Space Ring. However, I will also get something that allows me to store my stuff when I reach the General Stage. That kind of makes a Space Ring not worth it.'\nAs Shang continued towards the northeast, the sun continued going down. The afternoon had passed, and evening had arrived.\nShang saw several more beasts on his journey, but he still had no idea if he was allowed to kill them or not.\nThat was until he found some blood and signs of dragging on the ground.\nShang's eyes lit up.\nShang followed the signs and found a hidden burrow beneath a tree.\nJust like the last time, Shang lured the Pest Cat out of its burrow by throwing his sword in front of one of the entrances, but this time, the Pest Cat fled out of another exit.\nShang quickly killed it, cut off its ears, and looked into the burrow.\nAfter a minute, Shang came out of the burrow with a sigh.\n'No young.'\nShang jumped back to the trees and continued journeying to the northeast. He had decided that he would go deep into the forest. Right now, he was still in an area where a lot of students and hunters went to, which meant that the number of killable beasts was relatively low.\nIf Shang wanted to make his trip profitable, he would need to enter deep into the forest.\nA couple minutes later, Shang saw another Swamp Millipede, but this time, it was in the middle of a clearing in a big puddle. It was about as big as the other Swamp Millipede.\nWhat was the Swamp Millipede doing?\nIt was oozing out purplish liquid like a slug and munching on the surrounding earth. Shang decided to watch the Swamp Millipede for a while.\nOver the next minutes, Shang saw that the Swamp Millipede ate up all the grass in its surroundings and replaced it with black saliva.\nShang saw that black saliva slowly mix with the purplish liquid around the Swamp Millipede, and as soon as the two liquids came into contact with each other, they started sizzling.\nA bit of black smoke came out of the sizzling liquid, and it entered the Swamp Millipede's body again.\n'Did it convert the life energy of the fertile earth into smoke, which it then absorbed?' Shang thought. 'I mean, the Poison Affinity is a mix of the Water Affinity and Darkness Affinity. If my Darkness Affinity can absorb life energy, the Swamp Millipede can probably do something similar.'\nAfter watching the Swamp Millipede for a bit, Shang charged at it with all of his speed. The last Swamp Millipede had been a problem since it had been positioned weirdly, with its head protected.\nThis one was just in the open.\nThe Swamp Millipede noticed Shang, but it was already too late. One shouldn't forget that the Swamp Millipede was at the Middle Soldier Stage while Shang was at the Peak Soldier Stage. Together with Shang's advantage of surprise and his impressive speed, the Swamp Millipede couldn't even react before Shang cut its head in two.\nThis one also didn't have a nest, sadly.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ After cutting off the feelers, Shang continued traveling to the northeast.\nOver the next two hours, Shang killed a couple more Pest Cast and Swamp Millipedes. As his journey continued, they became more frequent.\nSadly, he hadn't found another nest.\nShang had just killed another Swamp Millipede and just wanted to go when he felt that something wasn't right.\nFor some reason, he felt really uneasy.\nHe felt like he was being watched by something dangerous.\nShang narrowed his eyes because he knew what was happening.\n'Is there a Vanishing Snake eyeing me?' he thought.\nShang looked around, but he couldn't see anything.\nHe looked at the trees, the grass, the ground, the bushes, at everything.\nHowever, he saw absolutely nothing.\nShang was pretty certain that a Vanishing Snake was around, but even when he knew that it was there, he couldn't find it.\nYet, a couple of seconds later, the feeling of being watched vanished.\n'It probably saw that I noticed something and decided to retreat.'\n'Fitting name. It's truly like it has vanished.'\n'Now, I can understand why that older student always dissuades people from coming here. If someone doesn't have a lot of experience in the wilderness, the Vanishing Snakes would be the death of them. I knew it was there, but I still couldn't find it.'\n'If that thing is that good at hiding, probably not even I would be able to react appropriately if I don't sense it early.'\n'That thing truly is worthy of 2,000 Contribution Points.'",

      "content": "Chapter 113 Circling\nAfter waiting for a couple more minutes, Shang noticed that the dangerous feeling didn't return.\nApparently, the Vanishing Snake had vanished.\nShang put the beast sack back on his back. It still was rather light since he only harvested ears and feelers.\nBy now, the sun was near the horizon. Soon, it would be night.\n'I should be able to find a lot more Pest Cats in the night. I've already found quite a few during the evening when they are hiding, which means that I will find even more during the night.'\n'This definitely isn't like Duke Whirlwind's garden. Duke Whirlwind's garden didn't have that many actual beasts. Most of the things in Duke Whirlwind's garden were animals.'\n'When I came to this world, I thought that the God put me in some dangerous area, but only now do I realize that he really had put me in some sort of tutorial area. If he had put me in this forest, I wouldn't even have survived a day probably.'\n'The most dangerous beasts in Duke Whirlwind's garden had been the Pest Cats, and there hadn't even been that many. Sure, there have also been some more powerful beasts, but they were rare. On top of that, the Ice Spear Bear was completely isolated in the lake and only appeared in the winter. If I didn't search for it, I wouldn't have found it.'\nShang continued towards the northeast, and soon enough, night hit.\nAs soon as the last glimmer of light vanished, the entire feeling of the forest changed, and a familiar feeling appeared in Shang's heart.\nThis was just like back when he had been in Duke Whirlwind's garden at night.\nIt was a feeling of pressure and unknown. It was like every nook and cranny could hide a powerful beast.\nShang knew that he wasn't in much danger since he counted as basically the strongest entity in this forest, but he still felt a bit nervous.\nHis instincts simply told him that he had to be careful.\nShang continued traveling towards the northeast and killed a couple more Pest Cats. Sure enough, Shang found one nearly every five minutes as soon as night hit. Luckily, since he was at the Peak of the Soldier Stage, his eyesight was pretty good.\nHowever, even that wouldn't have been enough to find that many Pest Cats.\nSo, how did Shang find so many?\nBecause Shang found something interesting.\nAs soon as the night hit, the Darkness Mana in the surroundings started to become denser.\nYes, ever since Shang had absorbed the Darkness Mana Source, he had been able to feel Darkness Mana. He was also able to feel Light and Fire Mana, but those two skills were irrelevant at the moment.\nThe fact that feeling Fire Mana was useless was logical, but why was feeling Light Mana useless? Shouldn't he have been able to feel his surroundings during the day by feeling the Light Mana?\nWell, it depended on the location.\nThe Wild Forest was thick, and not a lot of light reached the ground. Because of that, during the day, the Darkness and Light Mana had actually been in balance. There wasn't enough of either of them to feel the surroundings.\nBut now, during the night, Shang could use the Darkness Mana to feel out his surroundings.\nIt definitely wasn't very accurate, and it didn't have that much range, but it was something.\nShang could only perceive a bit of movement regarding Mana. If something without much Mana moved, like the wind or branches, he wouldn't be able to feel that. However, if something with a lot of Mana moved, the Mana in their own being shoved the Darkness Mana to the side.\nBut when it came to Pest Cats, it was a bit different. Shang couldn't feel them push the Darkness Mana to the side but gathering it. It was like they were attracting it and gathering it.\nShang guessed that this cloak of Darkness Mana was the reason why the Pest Cats were able to move that silently.\nAs Shang used his new ability, he also noticed something else.\nUp in the sky, something was displacing Darkness Mana, and it was displacing a lot.\nShang guessed that something was flying above him, above the forest, and it was quite powerful. Shang wasn't certain how powerful it was, but it felt more powerful than any of the beasts he had seen before in this forest.\nShang couldn't see the flying thing due to the trees, and he certainly didn't want to aggravate whatever was flying there by climbing above the trees to take a look.\nIf Shang knew more about the beasts in this forest, he would certainly take a look. However, as it was now, he didn't know whether he was allowed to kill it or not. If that thing up there was on the blacklist, and he provoked it, he would have to flee until it gave up.\nIt was better to just let it fly around in the sky.\nSuddenly, Shang's eyes narrowed, and he stopped moving.\nThe feeling had returned.\nAnother Vanishing Snake was near.\nShang didn't move at all. Last time, he had scared the Vanishing Snake off by looking around frantically, and he didn't want that to happen again.\nThe Vanishing Snakes were exactly the reason why Shang had come here.\nOne of them was worth 2,000 Contribution Points!\nEven with all of Shang's hunting up to now, he barely earned 900 Contribution Points.\nShang concentrated on his Darkness Vision and closed his eyes.\nHe had already learned earlier that it was impossible to spot the Vanishing Snakes with his eyes, which meant that he had to rely on his instinct and Darkness Vision.\nFor the first time in a long while, Shang was genuinely nervous. He felt a heavy feeling in his stomach, but he also felt some excitement.\nThis was the feeling of being close to death.\nIt had been so long since he had last come into contact with it.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang's pores opened, and his concentration reached its peak.\nHis entire mind was concentrating on his instincts and Darkness Vision.\nThe wind moved lightly through the forest, but mostly, the forest was silent.\nIn the middle of the night, Shang simply stood in a small clearing with closed eyes, in nearly total silence.\nAfter some seconds, Shang felt his instincts become louder. They were telling him that he was in danger.\nHowever, at the same time, Shang noticed something.\nSomething very small was moving in the darkness.\nIt was about ten meters away from him and moved very slowly.\nJudging by the displaced Darkness Mana, Shang guessed that it was probably only a meter long and very thin.\nShang narrowed his eyes.\nWhoosh!\nThen, Shang's eyes opened wide.\nWhat had he just felt?!\nSomething different had suddenly moved through the darkness at absolute ridiculous speeds!\nIt had come from the top, interacted with the supposed Vanishing Snake, and shot into the sky again.\nAll of that had happened in barely a second.\nShang's guess was confirmed when he felt the dangerous feeling vanish.\nThe Vanishing Snake had vanished once more, but this time, Shang knew where it had gone to.\nShang concentrated on the flying thing above him.\nThat thing had been the culprit.\nShang remained standing for several minutes.\nThat thing flying above him was extremely dangerous, and he didn't want to aggravate it.\nThe speed he had just witnessed was insanity!\nIt had probably moved as fast as teacher Loran when he had intervened in Shang's fights.\nShang remained in the same spot for ten more minutes.\nHowever, that thing circling above him didn't vanish.\nIt was like it was following him!",

Am I near its nest?'\nAfter a bit of deliberation, Shang continued walking towards the northeast.\nSure enough, the thing kept circling above him.\n'Shit! That thing's actually following me! Why is it following me when it doesn't attack me!?' Shang thought with frustration.\nShang moved around in senseless patterns to test if that thing was truly following him, and, sure enough, it kept following Shang, no matter where he went.\nShang's frown intensified. He definitely didn't feel comfortable with something like that circling above him.\n'If it decides to attack, I have to be ready. If I don't notice the very moment it charges down, I won't be able to react.'\n'The thing is very fast, but it doesn't displace enough Mana to be a General Stage beast. It feels a bit stronger than the beasts I saw before, but it doesn't give me the feeling of overwhelming dread that a General Stage beast does.'\nShang remembered that spider he had hidden from on his way to Warrior's Paradise. That thing had been in the General Stage, and Shang had felt absolutely helpless.\nIn comparison, the thing circling above him felt more like an extremely powerful Soldier Stage beast.\nShang guessed that the thing was probably just like Astor, someone a level below him that could threaten him.\nHowever, in comparison to Astor, this thing was a beast, not a human.\nWhile Shang knew that he couldn't win against Astor, everything was different when his opponent was a beast.\nShang specialized in killing beasts.\nIf Astor were a beast, Shang was confident in winning, but he would have to be very careful and not make any mistakes.\nSo, even though the thing was very fast, Shang knew that he had a chance. If it was a flying creature with a lot of speed, its defense and pure power probably weren't that powerful. That meant that Shang could end the fight with one strike. He only had to hit it when it charged at him.\nAnd what if the beast was on the blacklist?\nFuck that!\nShang could run from all manners of beasts, but that thing was far faster than him. Running would most likely end in his death since one wrong dodge would kill him.\nSo what if he had to pay a huge fine?\nHe had to stay alive!\nSuddenly, Shang stopped.\nAnother Vanishing Snake had appeared.\nShang continued standing on the spot and concentrated on his Darkness Vision.\nHis instincts were shouting at him, and Shang saw the Darkness Mana being displaced.\nWHOOOSH!\nShang frowned.\nJust like last time, the thing above Shang swooped down and killed the Vanishing Snake.\nSince Shang had been prepared this time, he had seen the thing move. He had barely looked in the direction of the Vanishing Snake before he saw a green streak shoot across his vision.\nShang hadn't been able to see much detail, but he had seen green feathers.\n'A green bird, huh?'\nFor a moment, Shang thought of the mission he had seen.\n'Capture a Spear Stork.'\nSpear Storks could reach the Commander Stage, and Shang had guessed that this might be a Spear Stork. That would explain its terrifying power.\nHowever, Shang hadn't seen a long beak. In fact, he hadn't seen any beak due to the speed of the green bird, but Shang was sure that it wasn't a Spear Stork.\nAfter all, if the green bird had a long beak, Shang would have seen it. He had only been able to see prominent features, and a long beak would have been a prominent feature, but since he saw nothing, it meant this thing didn't have a long beak.\nAfter this event, Shang also had an inkling as to why the green bird was following him.\n'It's using me as bait to catch Vanishing Snakes,' Shang thought. 'It only strikes when I can feel the Vanishing Snake too, which probably means that the Vanishing Snake needs to come out of hiding to hunt.'\n'The green bird can't see the Vanishing Snakes when they hide, which is why it follows me. The Vanishing Snakes see me as their prey, which gives the green bird an opening to strike.'\nShang took a deep breath.\n'However, the green bird really is terrifying. Vanishing Snakes are at the Late Soldier Stage in general, and the green bird should be on the same level. Yet, the Vanishing Snakes couldn't even defend themselves.'\n'That's bad,' Shang thought. 'I came here to hunt Vanishing Snakes, but if this thing keeps killing them, I won't be able to kill any of them.'\n'I might as well go to the northwestern forest if the most valuable prey in the northeastern forest is unavailable.'\nShang weighed his options.\n'Forget it. I'm already too far in the northeastern forest. Turning around now would waste a ton of time. I might as well hope that the green bird gets its fill of Vanishing Snakes and goes-'\n'Wait!' Shang suddenly thought with widened eyes. 'Aren't Vanishing Snakes multiplying by being eaten? Does that mean that the bird in the sky is already at death's door?'\n'Is it?' Shang thought with furrowed brows. 'Why do I feel like it isn't?'\n'Maybe it isn't eating the Vanishing Snakes?'\nShang concentrated on his Darkness Vision again.\nThen, he searched through the surroundings for places with dense Mana.\nA couple of seconds later, Shang found something.\nIt was the headless corpse of a translucent snake!\n'Is it only eating the heads? I mean, the eggs should be in the belly at the back, not in the head.'\n'Seems like the bird knows that it can't eat the entire corpse.'\nThen, Shang sighed.\n'Sadly, I can't turn in that corpse. It has obviously been killed by a beast, and the academy won't accept such a corpse.'\n'Anyway, I should continue. I hate having this death bird flying above my head the entire time, but it probably doesn't care about me. Might as well continue.'\nWas this a smart decision?\nProbably not.\nMost humans would have turned around. After all, the green bird was a huge unknown factor that could potentially end their lives. It was too risky to continue.\nHowever, for some reason, Shang enjoyed this feeling of danger.\nDancing on the edge of a cliff made Shang feel awake.\nHe felt alive.\nThe mix of terror, uncertainty, and excitement brought Shang a unique feeling that he had missed inside the academy.\nWhat was this feeling?\nShang wasn't sure, but it was the feeling of control.\nWhy control? This didn't seem to be related to control at all.\nIt meant that Shang's destiny was in his own hands.\nIf Shang died out here, it would be due to his own lack of skill.\nThere were no external factors like on Earth. On Earth, other, higher-ranked people often decided one's fate. If Shang were the most competent person for a job, he still wouldn't get it as long as the manager didn't like him.\nIn that situation, Shang's skills and abilities would have been easily enough to succeed, but other people had decided to take this chance away from him.\nBack when Shang had still been a fighter, he had known that he had had the abilities to enter the MNFA. However, it had still taken him another year to prove himself to them.\nWhy had it taken so long?!\nCouldn't they see how he had won every fight?!\nBut in this wilderness, everything was up to Shang.\nHis abilities were the only things that would decide his success.\nAnd Shang was confident in his abilities.\nHe knew that he would survive!\nAnd he wanted to prove that to himself.\nHe wanted to prove that he was in control of his life.\nThe more dangerous his surroundings, the more powerful he would feel after coming out victorious!\nShang didn't know all this. He only knew that he wanted to be in danger.\nIn his mind, he believed that the more danger he survived, the more powerful he would become.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ And that was true. Combat experience was incredibly important, and surviving difficult situations increased combat experience like nothing else.\nShang continued going towards the northeast, but he couldn't get far before something happened.\nThe green bird in the sky suddenly swooped down again, but it wasn't attacking Shang.\nBefore Shang could find the target the green bird was attacking, he heard an aggressive screech coming from it.\nIt was the kind of screech that a bird would use when a predator came close to its nest.\nShang looked over.\nBANG!\nThen, he heard the loud, explosive sound of two heavy objects hitting each other.\nShang's eyes widened.\nHe saw a translucent snake, but this one was different!\nIt was over ten meters long while the other one had only been one meter long!\nThe explosive sound Shang had heard had been its fangs clamping down on each other.\nLuckily, the bird managed to barely evade the violent teeth.\nAt that moment, Shang's heart stopped.\nHe hadn't noticed that Vanishing Snake at all!\nNot even his instincts had warned him!\nBut now that he saw it, he noticed the sheer amount of Mana it displaced.\n'General Stage!' Shang realized.\nThat also explained why the green bird hadn't been able to kill it.\n'What is a General Stage Vanishing Snake doing here?! I'm not that close to the Empress Cobra Zone, am I? Did it come to have its young?!'\n'What shitty luck is that?!'\nThe bird screeched again as it hovered near the Vanishing Snake.\nThen, it scratched the air with its talons.\nCRK!\nShang's eyes widened when three gigantic gashes opened up on the Vanishing Snake's side!\nThe three gashes were deep, and blood exploded out of them.\nThe snake hissed and tried to bite the bird again, but the green bird flew away.\nApparently, it had decided to retreat back into the sky.\nThat had probably been its strongest attack, and it had fled after seeing that its target was still alive.\nWhen Shang saw the three huge gashes on the snake, a glint appeared in his eyes.\nShang's heart pounded heavily as he made his decision.\nHe would kill it!",

      "content": "Chapter 115 Blade\nShang's heartrate sped up as he made the reckless decision to attack.\nA beast in the General Stage.\nHe hadn't fought one before.\nHowever, in comparison to all the other General Stage beasts Shang had met on his journey, this one felt like the weakest. Shang guessed that the other beasts had all been in the Middle or Late General Stage, while this one was most likely in the Initial General Stage.\nAdditionally, this was an ambush predator, and ambush predators generally weren't very good at direct combat. If their ambush failed, they would most likely flee.\nAnd most important of all, the green bird had injured the Vanishing Snake.\nUsually, Shang wouldn't try fighting against a General Beast because of his weak weapon. The body of a General Stage beast was very powerful, and Shang would have huge difficulties getting through their defenses.\nBut now, things were different. The Vanishing Snake had three huge gashes at the side of its body, and Shang could use these gashes to his advantage.\nHowever, Shang couldn't be too careful in this fight.\nIf the Vanishing Snake were at the Peak Soldier Stage, Shang would only need to look out for its bite, but that wasn't the case with this one.\nBeasts in the General Stage had true elemental powers, and Shang was certain that this snake also had one.\nThe Ice Spear Bear had been one of those beasts. Back then, Shang had learned that powerful beasts in the General Stage gave their offspring Mana Sources to awaken their elemental powers early.\nThis Vanishing Snake could probably do even crazier stuff than the Ice Spear Bear.\nAfter mentally preparing himself, Shang shot forward.\nThe Vanishing Snake was still looking at the green bird that had just retreated, making this the perfect opportunity to strike for Shang.\nShang closed in, and the Vanishing Snake only noticed him after he had already reached striking distance.\nShang directly targeted the three gashes on its left side with a stab.\nBANG!\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Out of nowhere, its tail suddenly struck forward with incredible speeds and hit Shang right in the chest.\nShang shot backward, but he had only received a couple of bruises. The snake had a stronger body, but it wasn't stronger to such a degree that Shang would be obliterated with one strike of its tail.\nHowever, his attack had failed, and Shang had to plan his next attack.\nAfter throwing Shang away, the Vanishing Snake looked at Shang, but it didn't hiss.\nShang didn't know much about snakes, but he knew a lot about beast behavior in general.\nHissing was a form of intimidation, and the snake didn't hiss.\nWhat was the purpose of intimidation?\nIt was to make the enemy retreat.\nSo, if the snake didn't hiss, it meant that it didn't want Shang to retreat.\nThat could only mean that the Vanishing Snake saw Shang as its next meal, even though it had failed the ambush.\nTo it, Shang probably didn't feel that powerful. Because of that, in its mind, it could still kill Shang.\nHowever, most of the snake's attention was still on the green bird. Shang felt incredibly weak to the snake, but the bird had injured it. Because of that, it always kept an eye out for the green bird.\nCRRRK!\nThe Vanishing Snake extended its tail, and grey Mana gathered around it. In an instant, a long and thick clump of metal formed on its tail, completely encasing it.\nWhile still keeping an eye on Shang, the Vanishing Snake put the base of its tail into its mouth. One had to remember that Vanishing Snakes had a full set of fangs instead of the two poison fangs that normal snakes had. Its teeth reminded one more of a wolf than a snake.\nSHING!\nSuddenly, the Vanishing Snake pulled the tail through its closed mouth. The metal that touched the inside of the Vanishing Snake's teeth became liquid and was swallowed by the Vanishing Snake, regenerating its Mana reserves.\nHowever, the metal that touched just the edge of its teeth started to heat up as the teeth and the metal ground together.\nShang's eyes narrowed, but inside, he was shocked.\nIt was a bad job, but the snake still managed to shape the metal around its tail into the shape of a blade. Its tail definitely wasn't very sharp, but with its power, it didn't need that sharpness.\nEarlier, Shang had received bruises by just being hit by the snake's tail. Now, even though the blade on its tail wasn't sharp, all its power would still be focused onto an edge or a tiny point.\nShang quickly realized that this was the snake's elemental power.\nIt had turned its back into a terrifying weapon.\nThis also made a lot of sense with its battle style. After all, if its ambush failed, its next course of action would be to flee, and this tail definitely helped in that. Predators would think twice about chasing something that continually pointed a long and sharp blade at them while running away. If they weren't careful, the snake could pull its body together like a spring and stab the beast chasing it.\nThe snake had accomplished all of this in just a single second. It had created the metal and the blade in basically an instant.\n'This is troublesome,' Shang thought. 'This thing has two weapons that can strike very fast. On top of that, its weapons are far harder than my sword. I can't use my sword to block, or it will become useless. I can take out weaker beasts with only my hands, but I doubt that will be useful against this one.'\nAs Shang thought more about his opponent, his plan slowly changed.\n'I could attempt to fight a stronger beast maybe under normal circumstances, but this one counters me due to its Affinity.'\n'If I had a good weapon, I could attempt fighting it.'\nThen, Shang got an idea. 'It will be risky, and it won't work forever, but it should give me a chance. After all, the snake's blade isn't like a human's weapon.'\nAt the moment, the snake had formed a coil with both its head and tail pointing upward. It was ready to strike with both of them if anything decided to come near.\nEarlier, the green bird had had the advantage of a surprise attack, but now, the snake was ready. If the bird decided to charge at the snake again, the snake's tail would skewer it. Shang had already seen how fast the snake's tail was, and it definitely wasn't easy to avoid.\nBANG!\nShang charged forward, and the snake quickly noticed his approach. It tensed its neck as it awaited his approach. Its tail was still pointing upward. Apparently, the snake kept its tail reserved for the bird that was still circling above them.\nWhen Shang came into the snake's range, its head shot forward with all of its speed.\nThe strike of the snake was incredibly fast, and Shang definitely wasn't fast enough to evade or parry the strike.\nHowever, Shang had never planned on evading.\nInstead of striking, Shang kept his sword pointed upward in front of him. In comparison to normal times, Shang held his sword with both hands this time.",

      "content": "Chapter 116 Metal Mana\nBANG!\nLike it had hit a wall, the snake's head was stopped by the sword. The snake was long, but it wasn't incredibly massive. Its head was barely half a meter across.\nBecause of that, Shang was able to block the snake's head with his sword.\nTo paint a clearer picture, one only needed to imagine an attacking dog. The dog bit forward, but the human in front of it took a long stick and held it vertically, pushing it back. Since the dog's head was in its normal position, its mouth couldn't open wide enough to get the entire length of the stick into its mouth. Sure, if the stick were horizontal, it wouldn't be a problem.\nShang's arms shook under the weight, but the snake hadn't put its full power behind its bite. After all, it still had to keep an eye out for the green bird.\nBecause of that, Shang managed to keep his sword relatively straight.\nWhen the snake's snout hit the blade, it began to bleed. The wound wasn't deep, but it had drawn blood.\nBANG!\nShang stepped forward and angled his sword on the snake's head. Then, he struck upward with the handle, making the snake's head fly up. Usually, Shang wouldn't have the power to push the snake away due to the difference in power in their bodies. However, the lever principle applied here.\nThe snake's head was far extended, essentially putting it out of balance and putting the head far away from its center of mass. Because of that, Shang could shove the head upward.\nAt the same time, Shang's sword was above him, and with the step he had just taken, his stance was perfect for a devastating strike downward.\nThen, Shang struck forward, cutting along the underside of the snake's jaw.\nCRRRRRRRR!\nSparks flew, and a couple of scales fell off, but the snake barely bled. Its scales were simply too hard.\nShang gritted his teeth, and the snake's head quickly went back into an attacking position.\nThe snake bit forward again.\nShang blocked with his sword.\nWhoosh!\nHowever, the snake's head stopped and angled to the side before striking forward again.\nBefore it had attacked, it couldn't have been sure at which angle Shang would hold his sword this time, which was why it had stopped to fake out Shang's block.\nWhen Shang saw the snake's head rotate, he quickly let himself fall to the ground to evade its strike.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ If his sword ended up in the snake's teeth, it would be destroyed. Sure, if Shang's sword were sharp enough to cut through the snake easily, he could have used that opportunity to split its jaw from its head. Sadly, the sword wasn't sharp enough.\nBANG!\nAs the snakehead arrived above Shang, he punched it away with the handle of his sword again. The distance was too small, which made it impossible to slash it with his sword effectively. From such a position, Shang's sword wouldn't be able to get through the snake's defenses.\nShang quickly angled his knees so that he could shoot forward.\nBANG!\nShang used all his power and charged forward. The snake's head had barely regained its control when it noticed Shang arriving near its body.\nFor a second, the snake thought about using its tail to strike Shang, but it was still scared of that green bird.\nSo, the snake moved its head towards Shang from his back. Sadly, since it didn't have the spring effect from its main body due to its head's position, it couldn't move at its normal speed.\nAs Shang reached its body, he noticed that the head was coming close to him again.\n'This is it!'\nOne scratch and he would die. Vanishing Snakes had terrifying metal poison, which would immediately destroy Shang's insides if that got into his bloodstream. Because of that, he couldn't allow himself to be hit at all.\nEarlier, Shang had been in a safe location. If he saw that his block wouldn't work as intended, he could have always jumped back.\nNow, his retreat was cut off.\nThe snake's head was behind him while its tail and body were in front of him.\nIf Shang decided to block the snake's head again with his sword, it would most likely strike with its tail. Yes, the snake was paying attention to the bird, but if it saw a surefire way of killing its prey, it would probably take the shot.\n'Let's hope this works!'\nAs the head closed in, Shang pointed his left arm towards it.\nBANG!\nShang jumped and unleashed a Fire Blast!\nThe Fire Blast wasn't powerful enough to hurt the snake in any way, but the wind slowed down the head, ruining its bite, while Shang was catapulted forward.\nThe snake's mouth barely missed Shang's feet as his body left the ground.\nThen, Shang grabbed the tail with his legs.\nThe snake quickly tried to bite Shang again, but Shang's nearly frozen arm unleashed an Ice Blast. Thanks to Shang's arm nearly being frozen, the Ice Blast had a lot of power behind it, ruining the snake's attack yet again.\nAt the same time, Shang put his sword to the metal blade in front of him.\n'Show your Magic!' Shang urged in his mind.\nAs soon as the sword touched the blade, Shang saw his sword shine in a bright light.\nIn nearly an instant, all the metal around the snake's tail was gone!\n'It worked! Luckily, that's not a human weapon!' Shang thought with exhilaration.\nAny half-decent blacksmith added special Magic Runes to their weapons. After all, it would be ridiculous if an opponent with a Metal Affinity could just ruin their weapons.\nOf course, these Magic Runes only became common at the General Stage. Because of that, Sarah's ability was still useful.\nSarah had been able to threaten Shang's sword with her ability since Shang's sword was weak. However, she wouldn't have been able to do that with Astor's weapon, for example.\nAdditionally, the Magic Runes didn't make the weapon completely immune to this ability but weakened it tremendously.\nLuckily, the snake's blade didn't have these Magic Runes.\nBecause of that, Shang could use the ability of his sword to absorb the metal around its tail.\nAt that moment, Shang's sword gave off a terrifying amount of Metal Mana.\nThe snake's tail hadn't been made with natural metal but with metal created with Metal Mana.\nThat was a big difference!\nKeeping Metal Mana in the state of solid metal ate up a lot of energy, meaning Mana. Because of that, metal constructs made out of Metal Mana didn't hold forever, and they needed a constant supply of Metal Mana to be maintained.\nBecause of that, Shang's sword wasn't strengthened permanently, but only until the absorbed Metal Mana inside it was used up.\nAfter absorbing the Metal Mana, Shang put his left hand on the snake's tail and used his Darkness Absorb.\nShang's nearly destroyed arm healed at unimaginable speeds as he quickly pointed his sword towards the snake's head again.\nSHING!\nThe snake had attacked again, but this time, Shang's sword was way sharper than before. It cut through the snake's snout for two centimeters but couldn't get through the entire bone.\nYet, it had worked, and Shang had finally managed to injure it.\nBut then, Shang felt himself being lifted by the tail.\nAt that moment, Shang was put before a crossroads.\nRemain on the tail and get smashed into the ground, very likely breaking several bones, or jump off?\nIf he remained, he would be severely injured.\nIf he jumped off, he gave the snake a chance to kill him in the air.\nShang gritted his teeth and made his decision.",

      "content": "Chapter 117 The Last Moment\nShang let go of the tail.\nBANG!\nThe tail slammed into the ground, destroying the earth beneath it. If Shang had kept hold of the tail, his spine would have most probably been broken. At that point, he would be unable to move, which would have been a huge issue in this fight.\nAs the tail hit the ground, a small explosion of blood appeared below it. Shang had consumed a huge amount of life energy from the snake's tail, making it weak. Because of that, it couldn't perfectly withstand the strong impact.\nAt the moment, Shang's left arm was swollen with life energy, and he felt like it was about to explode. However, that didn't matter.\nJust as predicted, the snake's head shot towards Shang. It would be difficult for Shang to block that attack with his sword in his position, but he didn't plan on doing that anyway.\nShang's arm pointed downwards.\nBANG! BANG!\nShang released a Fire Blast and an Ice Blast in rapid succession. The knockback of the two blasts shot him upward for a couple of meters, and the snake's attack missed.\nShang's arm was nearly destroyed again, but it quickly regenerated thanks to it being filled to the brim with life energy. In nearly an instant, Shang's arm was in peak condition again, and its life energy got depleted.\nRight now, Shang was over five meters above the snake.\nAs Shang stopped in the air, his eyes became cold as he readied his sword.\nCRRR!\nA new coat of metal appeared around the snake's tail, and it sharpened the tail in an instant.\nShang had just stopped in the air when the tail had already transformed into a blade again.\nShang had already expected that this would happen.\n'I can't absorb all the metal instantly during an attack. Even if I could, the sheer weight and force behind it would destroy a huge part of my body.'\nThe snake readied both its head and blade as it looked at Shang.\n'If the head hits me, my death is certain. If the tail hits me, I won't immediately die, but I will be severely injured. I can't block both attacks at once.'\n'I have to end it here!'\nShang had already anticipated this situation.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ He had been lucky that everything had gone according to plan up to now, but he couldn't trust his luck forever.\nIt was too dangerous to stay close to the snake. Earlier, he had to get in close in order to gain a weapon that could kill the snake, but now, he had it.\nShang also knew that he had only survived until now due to the three gashes on the snake's side. He hadn't been able to use them to injure the snake, but the gashes had probably slowed down the snake's attacks.\nAs Shang stopped in the air, time seemingly froze.\nThis instant seemed to go on forever in his mind.\nIt was the moment before the jump.\nAnd then, time continued.\nShang began to fall as the snake's tail and head shot towards him from below.\n'I have to kill it with this attack and survive its tail!'\nShang readied himself.\nJust at that moment, a green blur arrived at the base of the snake's tail. In an instant, a terrifying blade of wind left the green blur.\nCRKSH!\nThe terrifying sound of hard scales, bones, and flesh being destroyed echoed throughout the forest as the tail was severed.\nThe bird had recovered some of its Mana, and it had seen that the snake's tail had been weakened.\nBecause of that, the bird had swooped down while the snake had been preoccupied with Shang. Due to Shang's threat, the snake had forgotten to pay attention to the bird. A human might have remembered the bird, but the beast didn't.\nShang's eyes shone when he saw the tail falling to the side.\nHe hadn't expected that the green bird would strike right now, but he welcomed it.\nApparently, the bird still held a grudge for its failure to kill the Vanishing Snake earlier.\nFor just an instant, the snake got distracted by the searing pain.\nAt that moment, Shang saw his chance.\nHe pointed his left arm towards the sky.\nBANG! BANG!\nHis regenerated arm unleashed a Fire and Ice Blast.\nIn an instant, Shang reached incredible speeds as he directly shot toward the snake's head.\nHe couldn't allow it to recover its focus!\nIn the instant in which the snake had lost its focus, Shang's shooting body reached its head.\nAnd then, Shang struck.\nCRRRRRK!\nShang's sword punched through the snake's mouth, destroying the entire thing.\nHowever, the snake's skull eventually stopped the sword. Even with the upgrade, the sword wasn't powerful enough to cut through the entire head.\nShang's body hit the snake's head after his sword. The force of his body was too much for his arms to block.\nBANG!\nShang and the snake's head fell to the ground.\nLuckily for Shang, the injuries of the snake's head made its face rather mushy, cushioning Shang's impact.\nFor an instant, Shang couldn't breathe, but he was used to this sensation by now.\nIn a panic, the Vanishing Snake's head quickly lifted as a distorted sounding wind came out of the bleeding chunks that were once its mouth.\nIt was attempting to hiss.\nAt the same time, the Vanishing Snake quickly turned away.\nAnd then, it fled.\nIt had lost its tail and its teeth. All its weapons were destroyed.\nIt had to regenerate!\nShang quickly managed to get his breathing under control again as he stood up.\nJust before Shang chased after the snake, the screech of the green bird could be heard as it arrived beside the fleeing Vanishing Snake.\nIt had seen that its prey was injured and that it had lost all of its most dangerous weapons. Because of that, the green bird began to attack the snake violently.\nThe snake tried to throw the bird to the side by throwing its head around, but the bird easily evaded these weak and slow attacks.\nAs Shang chased after the fleeing snake, he finally got a good look at the green bird.\nIt had massive wings and powerful, long talons. The upper part of its beak was curved at the end, creating a sharp hook.\n'An eagle,' Shang thought.\nThe green eagle scratched the snake's head with its talons endlessly. At some point, it even managed to grab the snake with its talons and started to ram its beak into the snake's head.\nHowever, the Vanishing Snake didn't get many injuries. Without Mana, the green eagle couldn't easily get through the Vanishing Snake's scales.\nThe snake thrashed around under the attacks, trying everything in its power to get rid of the green eagle.\n\"Move!\" Shang shouted as he arrived beside the snake.\nThe bird noticed Shang, screeched, and flew off again.\nUnder the barrage of the attack, the snake hadn't heard Shang's shout, which made it oblivious to his presence.\nShang had arrived beside the snake's head, his sword lifted high above his body.\nAnd then, he struck down with all of his power.\nBANG!\nThe sword hit the snake's neck, cutting through the scales and flesh. When it hit the snake's vertebrae, it stopped, but the sheer force of the attack fractured the vertebrae.\nIn its panic, the snake moved its head around erratically, which made the splinters of the bone dig into its marrow.\nThe Vanishing Snake's movements turned into spasming as it lost control over nearly its entire body.\nShang lifted his sword again and struck the snake's neck again.\nBANG!\nThe snake's body seized once more before its movements became very small and weak.\nIts eyes were wide open, and blood was flowing out of its mouth.\nSilence.\nShang took a deep breath.\n'It's over.'",

If Shang had even been scratched by its teeth, he would have died. Its metal poison was just too powerful.\nDuring the fight, it had seemed that Shang was in control most of the time, but that control had been flimsy. One small slipup and it would have been the end.\nHowever, as Shang looked at the corpse, a deep feeling of excitement and satisfaction appeared inside his chest.\nHe had killed his first General Stage beast.\nSure, the beast was bad in a direct confrontation, it had been injured previously, Shang had help, and it had been distracted for a big part of the fight, but Shang had still won.\nShang looked at his sword. 'I really need to focus on my sword. This boost will only work for a short time, and I need to strengthen it permanently. In the beginning, I haven't even truly been able to injure it.'\n'Right now, my weapon is my biggest weakness. Fights where my weapon isn't in danger, aren't dangerous, and in dangerous fights, my weapon is always in danger.'\nSuddenly, Shang's eyes shot to the head of the snake.\nThe green eagle had landed on the snake's head, looking at Shang.\nShang had seen how the green eagle had eaten all the previous Vanishing Snakes' heads, and he knew that the bird wanted to consume this one too.\nThe bird was at the Late Soldier Stage, one level below Shang, but its help had been imperative in Shang's fight with the snake.\nIf Shang and the bird had a falling out, who would win?\nShang wasn't sure.\nHowever, he was sure of one thing.\nThe fight wouldn't end quickly, and Shang would probably be chased by the bird for a long time.\nShang knew that the bird was far faster than him. Not even the snake had been able to chase the bird.\nIf Shang missed his opportunity, the green eagle would fly away and wait in the air until Shang became distracted.\nIn the end, Shang sighed as he took a couple of steps back.\n'Even if I could kill it with confidence, I would feel bad about killing it,' Shang thought. 'I can be cruel to my enemies, but this eagle isn't my enemy.'\nShang put his sword away as he showed that he wouldn't fight over the corpse.\nIf the bird were a human, Shang would negotiate with them about gaining about half the corpse. Sadly, the bird was a beast.\nIf Shang suddenly started pulling or cutting on the corpse, the eagle might view that action as an attack, and that would spell trouble for Shang.\nSometimes, stupidity and stubbornness win.\nThe bird looked at Shang for a bit.\nThen, its eyes went to the Vanishing Snake's head.\nShang could see the hunger and desire in the green eagle's eyes.\nThis meal would catapult it to the Peak Soldier Stage, at least.\nThe eagle looked at the head for a bit longer.\nThen, it slowly moved its beak to the head and lightly tapped it twice.\nAnd it flew away.\nShang looked at the green eagle's leaving figure with surprise and a bit of confusion.\n'Why would the green eagle not want the corpse?' Shang thought.\nFor a while, Shang only looked at the corpse.\nThen, he got an idea.\n'It might sound ridiculous, but what if the green eagle didn't consume the corpse out of pride? The eagle doesn't seem like a pack beast. Does it only consume prey that it killed on its own?'\nAt that moment, Shang heard the sound of flesh being torn apart in the distance, and he immediately realized what had happened.\n'I think I'm right!' Shang thought. 'The green eagle went to the place where the snake's tail had been cut off. By the sounds of it, it's currently tearing the tail apart and eating it.'\n'It has severed the tail, but it hasn't killed the snake. Because of that, it only wants to eat the tail.'\nAt that moment, Shang narrowed his eyes.\n'That is a terrifying mindset,' he thought, 'and it also explains how the eagle can be so powerful at such a level. It only eats beasts it has killed by itself. On top of that, I can't forget that it had actually attacked a General Stage beast.'\n'The green eagle definitely knew that the Vanishing Snake was far stronger than all the other ones it had seen, but it still decided to attack. Just like me, it has searched for a dangerous fight that pushes it forward.'\n'It will become a dangerous beast in the future. I only hope it's not the kind that attacks humans.'\n'Well, I mean, it didn't attack me. So, it probably isn't that kind.'\nShang slowly walked over to the dead Vanishing Snake. 'I wonder how much a General Stage Vanishing Snake is worth.'\nShang extended his left arm towards the Vanishing Snake to shove it into his beast sack, but he grimaced when he felt a searing pain shoot through it.\nFor a moment, Shang was distracted by his injured left arm.\n'My new Affinities have increased my Battle-Strength by quite a lot. Sure, using my Blasts twice in quick succession will nearly destroy my arm, but I also have a way to regenerate its condition without using my Mana. I only have to touch my opponent.'\nShang thought about how he had used his left arm in the fight.\n'At the moment, its Blasts aren't very useful in terms of damaging my opponent, but they are very useful when it comes to moving around. I can use them to unexpectedly move around in the air, suddenly stop, or suddenly accelerate above my peak speed.'\n'My Blasts haven't done any damage to the snake, but they have allowed me to close in on the snake and deal a fatal strike in the end.'\nShang's eyes narrowed.\n'However, is that all my Affinity can do? I don't think so.'\n'With my additional Affinities, I also understand my Affinity more. I don't have an Ice or Fire Affinity, but an Affinity for converting the two.'\n'The Mana that gets unleashed in my Blasts has to come from somewhere, and it doesn't come from my body. So, it can only come from the surroundings.'\n'However, the surroundings have all kinds of Mana, and the heightened density of any kind of Mana won't increase the effect of my Blasts. Because of that, I can safely assume that my Mana isn't using the Ice or Fire Mana in the atmosphere.'\n'Instead, it's using the normal Mana.'\n'As far as I can tell, my arm can split normal Mana into Fire Mana and Ice Mana. When I use my Ice Blast, my left arm absorbs normal Mana and converts it into Fire and Ice Mana. The Ice Mana gets expelled while the Fire Mana heats up my arm.'\n'The more power I put into the Blast, the more Mana gets split apart. Because of that, the Blast also becomes more powerful.'\n'Usually, that would make the Blast only as powerful as what my arm can handle.'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang's eyes shone.\n'However, if I concentrate it, the effect will be different.'\n'If a kid attacks an adult with a stick, the adult only gets annoyed. However, if the same kid uses a knife, the adult gets injured. The force behind both attacks are about the same since it's the kid unleashing the attacks, but one of them is way more dangerous than the other one.'\n'The answer is concentration! The smaller the point of impact, the more effective the attack.'\n'I can heat and cool a huge part of the air a little bit, or heat and cool a small part of the air a lot.'\n'The knockback won't be as powerful since less air is being pushed to the side, but the Blast will have actual damage potential.'\n'When I'm back at the academy, I should try if I can do that.'\nFor a moment, Shang wasn't sure how he should feel.\nOn one hand, Shang now had even more things to train, increasing his workload.\nHowever, on the other hand, Shang now had even more things to train, giving him more opportunities and options to increase his power.\nShang thought about his left arm for a bit longer, but he quickly came back to reality as he realized that he was still in a rather dangerous forest.\nShang stopped thinking about his Affinity and shoved the General Stage Vanishing Snake into his beast sack.",

      "content": "Chapter 119 Idiot\nThe snake wasn't that big. Sure, it weighed a couple hundred kilograms, but Shang could pull that weight with relative ease. It was still annoying, and it definitely slowed him down, but Shang didn't need to constantly take breaks.\nLuckily, the beast sacks were made to handle such weight and even more. They were way better than the shitty garbage bags on Earth.\nWhen Shang put the corpse away, he decided to go to the north.\nWhy?\nBecause he had already met a General Stage beast.\nSince Shang had always gone towards the northeast, he couldn't be close to the Wasteland, which meant that the General Stage beast didn't come from there. Obviously, it came from the Empress Cobra Zone.\nSo, instead of directly traveling towards the Empress Cobra Zone, Shang decided to go directly north, towards the border of the Empress Cobra Zone and the Ice Wyvern Zone. Different kinds of elemental Mana were mixing on the border, making the area less interesting to more powerful beasts. Powerful beasts preferred Mana that had their Affinity.\nShang had the corpse of a General Stage Vanishing Snake, but he doubted that this corpse would last him forever.\nHe obviously needed more Contribution Points, and since he was already here, he decided to continue hunting.\nHe wouldn't waste any time this night.\nAfter Shang had traveled for five minutes, he noticed that the green eagle was no longer following him. Apparently, it had had its fill, and it was no longer interested in using Shang as bait for Vanishing Snakes.\nJumping from tree to tree became harder with the added weight, and Shang definitely made more noise than before, but he could still hunt.\nShang had the speed advantage over nearly every other beast, and when he saw one, he simply dropped the beast sack to charge after it.\nSince night had finally arrived, Shang found way more Pest Cats.\nIn fact, Shang found one nearly every three minutes, which was crazy in his mind.\n'No wonder they're called Pest Cats. They are literally everywhere!'\nOf course, it was mainly thanks to Shang's Darkness Affinity that he was able to find all these Pest Cats. Pest Cats moved very stealthily in the night, and they were great at hiding.\nHowever, since they all attracted Darkness Mana, Shang could find them rather easily.\nAs Shang continued going towards the north, he saw fewer and fewer Swamp Millipedes but more and more Pest Cats.\nShang was only going towards the north to avoid the General Stage beasts from the Empress Cobra Zone, but he didn't know that there would also be far fewer beasts from the Empress Cobra Zone in general.\nBut why?\nSwamp Millipedes converted their surroundings into swamps, right? So, why would they enter the Wild Forest in the Storm Eagle Zone but avoid the border with the Ice Wyvern Zone?\nThe reason was the Ice Mana.\nBut wait, that also didn't make much sense. Ice was basically just another form of water, right? The Poison Affinity was made of the Darkness and Water Affinities. Why would the Poison Affinity beasts avoid that?\nBecause of conversion.\nTo destroy an element or Affinity, one didn't necessarily need the opposite element or Affinity.\nIf one drop of water touched a bigger sheet of ice, it would most likely turn to ice. If a small piece of ice were thrown into a bucket of water, it would most likely turn to water.\nBecause of that, the density of Water Mana at the border between the Empress Cobra Zone and the Ice Wyvern Zone was far lower.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ In comparison, the Wind Mana in the Storm Eagle Zone didn't really interact with the Water or Darkness Mana from the Empress Cobra Zone. These kinds of Mana could coexist without clashing.\nBecause of that, the Swamp Millipedes preferred the Storm Eagle Zone over the Ice Wyvern Zone.\nSadly, Shang didn't know that. In his trip towards the north, he also wanted to hunt Swamp Millipedes, but he would be doomed to not find another one for the remainder of the night.\nBut instead, Shang found a lot of Pest Cats. Every single one of them was still worth 20 Contribution Points, and Shang definitely wouldn't refuse that.\nShang had just harvested another two ears and went back to his beast sack when his instincts suddenly screamed at him.\nCLINK!\nShang jumped to the side out of reflex, and he felt something strafe past his side, hitting part of his uniform.\nAt that moment, Shang's heart nearly stopped.\nJust now, a Vanishing Snake had attacked him.\nShang had evaded with incredible speed and reflexes, but the snake had also been very quick. Because of that, its teeth had scratched Shang's uniform.\nFor an instant, Shang felt like his death had arrived.\nBut then, he quickly recovered, gritted his teeth, and attacked the Vanishing Snake.\nSHING!\nThe snake was cleanly cut in half as Shang released all his terror, shock, and anger.\nShang's heartrate had shot through the roof as he felt that he had just dodged death by a hair.\n'My uniform saved my life,' Shang thought in terror as cold sweat ran down his back.\nThe uniform of the academy could block a Mid Soldier Stage attack at the sides and a Peak Soldier Stage attack near the heart.\nThe Vanishing Snake had been at the Late Soldier Stage.\nIf it had managed to actually bite down on Shang or his uniform, the uniform wouldn't have provided much protection, but since Shang had managed to jump to the side, the snake's teeth had only barely scratched it. Because of that, his uniform had been able to block the attack.\nShang would already be dead if that incident had happened with the General Stage Vanishing Snake.\nFor a moment, Shang only tried to come to terms with what had just happened.\n'I nearly died.'\n'I nearly died!'\nShang gritted his teeth in frustration and anger.\nAt whom were the frustration and anger directed?\nAt himself, of course.\n'I walked through the forest recklessly, only looking for Pest Cats and Swamp Millipedes. After killing the General Stage Vanishing Snake, I also didn't fear the normal Vanishing Snakes anymore. After all, why would I care about these weak Vanishing Snakes when I have already killed the big one?'\n'I'm fucking stupid!'\n'I'm a fucking idiot!'\n'So what if I killed a much more powerful variant? One good attack from a Vanishing Snake, and I will still be a goner!'\n'That I survived that attack just now is way luckier than me surviving the battle against the General Stage Vanishing Snake!'\n'I'm literally only alive because of the protection the academy gave me, free of charge!'\n'I never relied on the protection of my uniform, but I'm only alive thanks to that uniform now!'\n'I've become careless.'\nAt the moment, Shang didn't even think about the 2,000 Contribution Points of this Vanishing Snake.\nAll his focus was on his surroundings and his frustration with himself.\n'I can accept dying in a fight, but I can't accept dying in such a stupid way!'\n'Shang! Pay attention! You are not the strongest! You can still die in here! Don't fucking forget that, you fucking idiot!' Shang mentally screamed at himself.\nAfter urging his brain to remember to pay attention for some more seconds, Shang took a deep breath and sighed.\n'I can't become careless now.'\nAfter some more seconds of calming down, Shang shoved the Vanishing Snake into his beast sack and continued towards the north.",

      "content": "Chapter 120 Teacher\nShang continued traveling towards the north for another two hours, killing tons of Pest Cats on his way.\nSadly, he hadn't met another Vanishing Snake in these two hours. Now, he was ready for them, and they decided not to show up.\nAfter these two hours, Shang turned around and traveled towards the southwest.\nAbout half the night had already passed, and Shang was rather certain that he would need the remainder of the night to exit the Wild Forest, especially with the added weight of his beast sack.\nFor the next couple of hours, Shang killed Pest Cats while going towards the southwest, and finally, he also found another Vanishing Snake.\nThis encounter wasn't nearly as dangerous as the previous one. When Shang had noticed it, he slowed down a bit but kept running. After the Vanishing Snake appeared in Shang's darkness vision, he immediately dropped his beast sack and charged toward it, killing it rather quickly.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Shang killed a couple more Pest Cats before he noticed that he found fewer and fewer of them.\nAnd then, he saw none of them anymore.\nShortly after, Shang came out of the Wild Forest.\nAs Shang exited the Wild Forest, he saw that the sky in the east was slowly beginning to light up, which meant that dawn would soon arrive.\nIn front of Shang were lots of fields growing wheat.\n'The Farm Line, huh? Seems like I went quite far into the north.'\nShang searched for a way through the fields and continued walking towards the west. For once, he decided to stroll instead of run. He had run nearly the entire night, and he wanted to relax for a bit. Additionally, it had been a while since Shang had walked through such fields.\nThese fields of wheat reminded Shang of home. He hadn't always lived in the city, and these fields of wheat reminded him of his childhood.\nSuddenly, a large shadow appeared beside Shang.\nBANG!\nShang jumped to the side with all his power, shaking the ground beneath him.\nAt the same time, Shang heard the startled yelp of a dog from the shadow as it also jumped back.\nOnly now did Shang notice that this was just one of the guarding dogs in the Farm Line. The huge shadow and the weight of Mana inside the shadow had startled Shang.\nOf course, the dog hadn't anticipated for Shang to jump away, resulting in it also getting startled.\nAnother two dogs, a couple of houses down, lifted their ears as they looked towards the dog beside Shang.\nWhen they saw that nothing of note was happening, they only put their heads down to sleep again.\nThe startled dog looked at Shang with eyes that he interpreted as accusing.\nIt was like the dog was blaming Shang for startling it.\n\"Don't sneak up on me like that,\" Shang said after a sigh.\nWho wouldn't get startled by a two-meter-high beast shadow suddenly appearing beside them?\n'It probably smelled the General Stage Vanishing Snake in my beast sack and became curious. The dogs are probably specially trained to kill these kinds of snakes since they are the biggest danger to the Farm Line.'\nAfter sniffing the beast sack from a distance for a little bit, the dog turned around and left.\n'Well, there goes the relaxing atmosphere,' Shang thought as he started jogging. While strolling through the fields, Shang had felt quite calm. He had just come from a dangerous location with several dangerous encounters while carrying a lot of wealth on his shoulders. That had made the stroll rather enjoyable.\nBut now, all the joy was gone.\nShang had lost the mood and sped up as he jogged towards Warrior's Paradise.\nIt took him quite a while with the added weight, and before he knew it, he saw other people running beside him towards Warrior's Paradise.\nShang saw a lot of students who looked at his beast sack with interest.\nHowever, they were used to such sights, which made them interested but not interested enough to strike up a conversation.\nShang also passed by a lot of other students and teachers without saying a word. He didn't want to waste any time since the streets would only become busier, and he definitely wasn't interested in entering a traffic jam during rush hour.\n\"Wait!\"\nShang suddenly heard the voice of a woman, and he somehow felt like it was directed at him.\nShang stopped and turned around.\nHe hadn't paid any attention, but Shang had passed by a woman with long black hair and a silver uniform. She looked like she was in her late twenties, and there was an interested but distant look in her eyes as she looked at Shang.\n\"Yes, teacher?\" Shang asked.\nIn comparison to many of the other teachers, this woman wasn't accompanied by any students.\nObviously, she wasn't a very sociable person.\nThat was also why many other students became interested in why she had stopped Shang.\n\"Come over here for a second,\" she said, gesturing for Shang to come over.\nShang's brows furrowed, but he complied. After all, she was far stronger than him, and she was also his teacher.\nShe extended her hand to the beast sack on Shang's shoulder and moved her finger over it. Then, she put the finger to her nose and smelled it.\nAfter that, her brows furrowed.\n\"I want to see the corpse,\" she said.\n\"Of what?\" Shang asked.\n\"You know what I mean,\" she said with annoyance.\nThis piqued the interest of the other students.\nA corpse that their teacher was interested in? That had to be a special corpse!\nShang's brows furrowed even more. \"Why?\" he asked.\n\"Because we have to note down every appearance of them,\" she explained. \"They are an important indicator for the status of the northeastern Wild Forest.\"\nThis alleviated Shang's trepidation.\nIt made sense. The General Stage Vanishing Snakes laid their eggs in the Wild Forest to avoid the predators in the Empress Cobra Zone. That meant that there was always a certain distance between the Empress Cobra Zone and the location of the eggs.\nIf the General Stage Vanishing Snakes went further into the Wild Forest, it might mean that the Swamp Millipedes had claimed a bigger part of the Wild Forest than before.\nShang looked at the interested eyes of the other students.\n\"Fine, but I don't want to show it to the public,\" he said.\nThe teacher gestured to the western Wild Forest. They hadn't yet arrived at the slope to Warrior's Paradise, which meant that they could just run a couple of kilometers to the west to enter the Wild Forest.\nShang and the teacher ran towards the west and entered the Wild Forest while the students on the path were annoyed that they wouldn't be able to witness the corpse.\nWhy had Shang decided to hide the corpse?\nBecause he wanted to keep his strength a secret.\nThe less attention there was on him, the easier his life would be.\nAfter entering the Wild Forest, the teacher stopped. \"No one will spy on you here,\" she said.\nShang put the beast sack down, put his hand into the sack, and pulled out the corpse of the General Stage Vanishing Snake.\nWhen she saw the corpse, her eyes narrowed.\nThen, her eyes went towards Shang, his sword, and back to the corpse.\nFor a second, her brows furrowed in confusion, but then she noticed the lower part of the snake's neck.\nThree large gashes were there.\nAt that point, a light of recognition lit up in her eyes.\n\"Seems like you had some help.\"",

It was in the Late Soldier Stage, but it was able to damage a General Stage beast to this degree with only a single attack.\"\n\"First, I want to know what happened to the green eagle,\" the teacher ordered. \"Don't omit any detail.\"\nShang frowned, but he complied. \"The green eagle was the one that found the snake. I can feel the approach of the weaker variants, but I hadn't felt the approach of this one.\"\n\"The eagle attacked, but it failed in its assault and released that powerful attack before retreating,\" Shang said as he pointed at the three gashes. \"I decided that this is the best opportunity to earn some money and combat experience, which is why I attacked the snake.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Near the end of the fight, the green eagle returned and severed the tail. After that, I killed the snake. I saw that the green eagle was a huge threat to my safety, which is why I didn't want to fight over the corpse with it. However, funnily enough, it just let the corpse lay there and ate the tail instead.\"\n\"I haven't seen it since.\"\nThe teacher looked into Shang's eyes for a while, trying to make sure that Shang wasn't lying.\nThen, she nodded. \"Everything you said makes sense.\"\nThe teacher stood up and stepped away from the corpse, looking at Shang. \"It's good that you didn't attack it.\"\n\"What kind of beast is it?\" Shang asked.\n\"Progeny of the Storm Eagle,\" she answered.\n\"The… Storm Eagle?\" Shang asked in shock.\nThe Storm Eagle!?\nThe very beast that had this Zone named after it?\nThe very beast that could kill all the humans if it wanted to?\nThe teacher nodded. \"Its young keep flying around in this area. It has a couple of them, and you met the youngest. Luckily for us, they don't attack humans.\"\n\"Of course, that means that we also are forbidden from attacking them. The last time a human had killed one of the Storm Eagle's young, the Storm Eagle went on a rampage.\"\nThe teacher pointed in the direction of Warrior's Paradise.\n\"This city was built after the Storm Eagle's last rampage, but it isn't the first version of Warrior's Paradise. There have been a couple of them before, but as you can guess, when the Storm Eagle got angry, they stopped existing.\"\nShang took a deep breath.\nIf he had decided to kill the green eagle, and if he had succeeded…\n\"Now you get why I am so interested in the Storm Eagle's young's whereabouts,\" the teacher added. \"I'm not interested in being turned to dust anytime soon.\"\nShang nodded, but he also fell into thought.\nThe Storm Eagle's young.\nThat also explained the discipline and sheer power of the green eagle.\nIt came from the most powerful beast that Shang knew of, which meant that it was already destined for greatness.\nHowever, greatness could only be realized with hard work and discipline. The young eagle had shown hard work by attacking a General Stage beast, and it had shown discipline by not consuming something it hadn't killed.\nJust based on its bloodline, the green eagle was already a prodigy beyond compare, but on top of that, it was working and training intensely.\nIt was a perfect beast.\nAnd then, Shang remembered something.\n\"It ate the tail,\" Shang said. \"What about the eggs?\"\nThe teacher lightly kicked a part near the end of the corpse. \"Right here,\" she said.\nThat made Shang release a sigh of relief.\n\"Tell me where you found the snake,\" the teacher ordered. \"We need to document where the adult ones appear.\"\nHer voice pulled Shang out of his thoughts, and he recounted his journey up to where he had found the snake.\nAfter he was done, the teacher combed her long black hair with her fingers, her eyebrows furrowed in thought.\n\"It's a bit further than normal, but it isn't crazily out of place,\" she muttered. Then, she looked at Shang with slightly narrowed eyes. \"Why did you decide to go that far into the northeastern forest? Was your goal a General Stage beast from the very beginning?\"\n\"I'm not suicidal,\" Shang answered. \"If I had known that a General Stage Vanishing Snake could appear there, I wouldn't have gone there. If the green eagle hadn't been there, I would have died without even noticing.\"\nThe teacher furrowed her brows, but then she noticed something. \"I don't recognize you. Have you been in my class?\"\nShang shook his head. \"I only joined a couple of days ago, and I have only visited one class up to now.\"\n\"That explains things,\" she said. \"Listen. Yes, the Wild Forest is a Rank One wilderness, but that doesn't mean that you can't find the occasionally General Stage beasts there. Especially the older ones need to go there to have their young.\"\n\"In the northeastern Wild Forest, you can find the occasional adult Vanishing Snake, Poison Toad, Ancient Slug, and Mud Pangolin. Not only will they most likely kill you, but the latter two are even on the blacklist.\"\n\"If you want to hunt in the northeastern Wild Forest, don't go further than the spot where you found the Vanishing Snake. That spot should be your cutoff point for the northeastern and southern directions.\"\n\"From that point onward, you can draw a straight line north until the end. Everything east of that is dangerous territory, while everything left of that is relatively safe.\"\nWhile explaining, the teacher drew a couple of lines in the dirt to show a map. Then, she drew a line through the map, starting at the bottom left corner and ending in the middle of the top, separating the map into two parts.\n\"You can safely hunt in these 40% of the map,\" she said, tapping on the northwestern part of the northeastern forest. \"The remainder is dangerous.\"\nShang looked at the map and burned it into his mind. \"Thanks,\" he said.\n\"I would advise you to enter my class first before going hunting again. You obviously don't know anything about the wilderness around here, and it shows. I'm teaching the beast knowledge class,\" she said.\nShang nodded. He had already expected something like that.\nThe teacher had given off a threatening, solitary, and explosive aura since the very beginning. When Shang had seen her, he had immediately been reminded of that one scout he had met on his journey to Warrior's Paradise.\n\"I will keep that in mind, teacher,\" Shang answered.\nThe teacher nodded. \"I would advise against handing that corpse over to the academy,\" she suddenly said.\nShang furrowed his brows. \"Why?\"\n\"Under normal circumstances, it would be in your best interest to give nearly everything to the academy since Contribution Points are more valuable to you. However!\"\nThe teacher lightly tapped on the three gashes on the snake's side.\n\"The value of this corpse goes beyond its materials,\" she said.\nShang looked at the three gashes in confusion.\n\"People all over the world are in awe of the Storm Eagle,\" she continued. \"However, nearly no one is insane enough to capture one of its young or steal from them. Because of that, finding something that one of the Storm Eagle's young had left a mark in is very rare, and there are several wealthy individuals in the world that collect these things.\"\nShang's eyes widened.\nThat actually made sense!\nIf a celebrity on Earth had owned something before, its worth would increase.\n'So, these three gashes are basically an autograph?' Shang thought.",

      "content": "Chapter 122 Teacher Niria\n\"How much should I ask for?\" Shang asked.\n\"No less than 2,000 gold,\" the teacher said.\nShang's eyes widened.\n2,000 gold?!\nHe had 27!\nThe overpriced ore in the academy was worth only around 200 gold!\n\"How much would it be worth under normal circumstances?\" Shang asked in shock.\n\"Around 500 gold,\" the teacher said, \"and that's considering its rough condition. A well-preserved corpse can go for 800.\"\n\"And the young ones?\" Shang asked.\n\"Around 50 gold,\" she said. \"You can't compare Soldier Stage beasts with General Stage beasts. Why do you think there are so many hunters here? General Stage beasts are worth a lot of money.\"\nNormal Vanishing Snakes were already at the Late Soldier Stage, while the adult variant was at the Initial General Stage. Yet, that already increased the price by more than a matter of ten!\nShang remembered the reason why the academy wanted collateral of five gold for every special exam.\nSure enough, powerful warriors could earn money easily.\n\"Go to the Curio Trinket in Warrior's Paradise. It's a shop at the edge of the market. They should be interested in that corpse,\" the teacher said. \"Tell them teacher Niria sent you.\"\nThat surprised Shang. \"Why are you helping me to this degree? This doesn't sound like the normal kind of help.\"\n\"I can respect potential and power,\" teacher Niria said neutrally. \"Additionally, you might not know it, but we are connected.\"\n\"Connected?\" Shang asked.\n\"When you realize what I mean, and if you are willing to trust me, you can ask me after class, but I won't elaborate on that matter,\" she said. \"You have your way, and I have my way.\"\nThis threw Shang for a loop.\nHe had no idea what she was talking about.\nObviously, she wasn't romantically interested in him. Shang saw absolutely no signs of attraction in teacher Niria's demeanor. On top of that, they had just met.\nEither she was crazy, or she knew something that Shang didn't.\n'Is the dean not the only other person from Earth?' Shang thought.\n\"I will go back to the academy,\" teacher Niria said.\nShang had questions, but he saw in Niria's demeanor that she wasn't interested in talking anymore.\n\"Thank you again, teacher,\" he said.\nTeacher Niria nodded once and left.\nNow, Shang was alone again, and he looked at the corpse of the snake in confusion.\nHe still had no idea what she was talking about.\nIn the end, Shang gave up trying to find the reason for her words.\nHe grabbed a second beast sack and shoved the corpse into it. Since he would now sell the corpse to someone else, he decided to separate the corpse from the ears and feelers.\nAfter that, Shang went back to the street, and he saw a great number of wagons and people walking on the street. He had spent quite a bit of time in the forest with teacher Niria, and rush hour had arrived.\nShang could only sigh and entered the busy street.\nHe had to walk slower due to all the traffic, but the traffic still wasn't as bad as Shang had thought.\nShang looked to the side at the ridiculous width of the street. Who even made a road that's an entire kilometer wide?\nBut now, Shang saw that over half of the road's width was used up.\n'How is Warrior's Paradise not overflowing with stuff with so many wares arriving every single morning?' Shang thought.\nA while later, Shang arrived in front of the widely opened gates. Several big crystals were around the gate. They looked like they were supposed to give off light, but they didn't right now.\nShang quickly realized what these crystals were there for when he noticed that the guards didn't even inspect any of the wares entering the city.\n'I guess these crystals are kind of like a metal detector, but for illegal goods, maybe?' he thought.\nWhen Shang had arrived during the night, someone had gone through his stuff manually. Operating the crystals probably cost a lot of Mana, and it probably wasn't worth it to keep them running throughout the night.\nIn the end, just like everyone else, Shang entered the city without being stopped.\nThe streets became far more crowded, and Shang had to slow down a lot until he eventually stopped.\nNow, this was a real traffic jam.\nHowever, Shang quickly noticed that he was the only actual person stuck in the traffic jam. The other people in the traffic jam all rode carriages and other kinds of vehicles.\nShang looked around and found some people walking along the side of the road.\n'Wait. They actually have sidewalks? How did I never notice that?'\nShang looked around and then awkwardly moved towards the sidewalk.\nFreed from the traffic jam, Shang jogged toward the marketplace.\nJust like always, the marketplace was filled to the brim with wares, stalls, and merchants.\nShang walked along the edges of the marketplace since teacher Niria had said that the Curio Trinket was near the edge.\nAnd, sure enough, Shang eventually found the shop.\nIn comparison to nearly all the shops, the Curio Trinket was inside an actual building and not some stall or shed.\nShang didn't see any people in front of the shop, which surprised him a bit.\nNevertheless, Shang still entered.\nInside the Curio Trinket, Shang saw many rings, amulets, crystals, and other kinds of, well, trinkets. The name sure was fitting.\nShang saw no other customers.\n\"You're in the wrong shop,\" someone shouted from the back of the shop. \"We don't trade in beasts.\"\nObviously, the person in the back of the shop had noticed the beast sack on Shang's back.\n\"Teacher Niria sent me,\" Shang answered.\n\"Huh?\" the person in the back of the shop uttered, and the head of a young man peeked over the corner. \"Teacher Niria? She doesn't normally send proxies.\"\n\"Well, she told me to contact you,\" Shang said.\nThe man furrowed his brows and stood up. After that, he came out of the backroom.\nHe had red hair and wore red robes. On top of that, Shang felt a lot of Fire Mana coming from the person.\n'That should be a Fire Adept,' Shang thought. 'There aren't that many Fire Mages in Warrior's Paradise.'\n'That also explains why no one is here. If this shop has a Fire Adept as their clerk, they probably don't sell cheap stuff.'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Someone like a Fire Adept could earn a ton of money just by going into the Wasteland and killing any random General Stage beast. So, since this Fire Adept wasn't doing that, it probably meant that he earned more by being a clerk in this shop.\n\"Did she get another interesting beast?\" the Fire Adept asked with a bit of interest.\n\"I thought you said you don't trade in beasts,\" Shang said.\n\"I say that to everyone since it takes too long to explain to them what we are interested in when it comes to beasts,\" the Fire Adept explained. \"Now, show me what she's killed this time.\"\nThe Fire Adept walked to a large table at the side of the room and knocked on it to show Shang where to put the corpse.\nShang walked over and put the corpse on the table.\nAs soon as Shang let go of the beast sack, it opened on its own, revealing its contents.\nWhen the Fire Adept saw the General Stage Vanishing Snake, he furrowed his brows. Then, he looked at Shang. \"Why should I care about a Vanishing Snake?\" he asked with annoyance.\nShang only gestured to the three gashes.\nThe Fire Adept looked at the three gashes with furrowed brows.\nThen, a glint of recognition appeared in his eyes.\n\"Oh, now we're talking,\" he said with a smirk.\nAfter saying that, the Fire Adept closely examined the corpse with many different instruments.\nA couple of minutes later, when he was done, he put the instruments away with a smirk.\n\"Sure enough, Niria killed this one. Her handiwork is unmistakable,\" he commented.\nShang blinked a couple of times in confusion.\nHe was pretty sure that he was the one that killed the snake.\n\"How do you know?\" Shang asked.\n\"Client confidentiality,\" the Fire Adept answered with a smirk. \"You might have been sent by her, but I won't give up the secrets of our clients.\"\n\"How do 1,800 gold sound?\" he asked.\n\"Teacher Niria also told me what I should ask for,\" Shang added.\nThe smirk on the Fire Adept's face vanished.\n\"Fine,\" he said with a sigh.\nSHING!\nFour sacks appeared near the table, two big ones, and two small ones.\n\"Take your 2,200 gold,\" he said.\nShang nodded and took the gold.\n\"Happy doing business with you,\" the Fire Adept said with less enthusiasm while taking care of the corpse.\nShang nodded. \"Thank you.\"\nAnd he left the store with his new wealth.\nOnce again, he was rich.\nThe dangerous fight sure had been worth it.",

      "content": "Chapter 123 Psychopath\nAfter Shang left the Curio Trinket, he paused.\n'Teacher Niria seems to be really good at bartering. She told me that I should accept no less than 2,000 gold, but as soon as I told the guy that teacher Niria told me what I should accept, he gave me more. Glad I didn't make a direct offer.'\nShang looked at the second beast sack he was carrying. He had decided to mask his gold by putting it into a second beast sack. He didn't want anyone to become suspicious of his wealth. Additionally, Shang had entered the shop with two beast sacks, and he was now exiting with two beast sacks. It would look like his trade had failed.\nNo one knew that the contents of the second beast sack had changed to pure gold.\nAfter exiting the shop, Shang directly traveled to the academy. An unknown teacher was guarding the gate, and Shang gave them a quick greeting before entering.\nShang directly walked toward the main building. He wanted to put the gigantic sack of gold away first.\nSadly, things didn't go as smoothly as he had expected.\nAs soon as Shang approached the main building, his eyes narrowed.\nHe had noticed three boys looking at his beast sacks, and Shang had also noticed that they seemed rather tense. They were all around 16 or 17 years old, which meant that they were well in the Middle Soldier Stage.\nIronically, this was the most dangerous spot to be in.\nAt that level, the students would no longer belong to the truly weak ones, but they also wouldn't have enough experience to tell if someone was truly dangerous or not. Because of that, the Intermediate Grade had the most fights.\nAnd the grade that suffered the most was the Beginner Grade.\nThe Intermediate Grade would most often target 14- and 15-year-old students. These students could earn a lot of money, but they were also far weaker and less experienced than the students in the Intermediate Grade.\nBecause of that, the Beginner Grade was the most horrible grade to be in, thanks to the Intermediate Grade.\nHowever, the Intermediate Grade was walking on a tightrope. They could probably dominate over 90% of all people in the Beginner Grade, but they also wouldn't notice the most powerful 10% of the Beginner Grade.\nBut these people could tell that Shang was powerful. They didn't know how powerful he was exactly, but they had seen how he had dominated a couple of Early Soldier Stage kids.\nThis meant that he had to be, at least, in the Middle Soldier Stage. Maybe, he even was in the Late Soldier Stage.\nBut that's also why they came with three people at once.\nOn top of that, they were rather confident in taking down Shang.\nWhy?\nWell, there was one familiar face among the people.\nIt was Shang's neighbor, the one he had met when he had searched for his room.\nWhen that guy heard that Shang was part of the Caterpillar Class, he had smirked and told him that he had entered hell.\nWhat was the reputation of the Caterpillar Class?\nTrash.\nWhy trash?\nBecause they didn't train in any actual fighting techniques. Every other student trained in several advanced techniques that perfected their fighting styles.\nIn a direct fight, people of the Caterpillar Class nearly always lost against other students. Only the most powerful students in the Caterpillar Class could fight the other students.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ However, that was to be expected.\nThe students of the Caterpillar Class were forced to build their own fighting techniques, which meant that their fighting techniques came from someone in the Soldier Stage.\nMeanwhile, the other students were training in techniques created by Commander Stage warriors.\nThese techniques were multiple times more powerful and refined than some techniques some kids could come up with.\nSo, how did these three people view Shang?\nHe definitely was a very powerful person for his age, but that was the problem.\nFor his age.\nHow much experience could a 14- or 15-year-old have in fighting against humans?\nOn top of that, they were three, while Shang was one.\nThey knew that it would be risky, but the reward was worth it.\nThey had seen how interested teacher Niria had been, and they knew that Shang must have something very interesting in one of his beast sacks.\nIt was risky, but they had to try!\nSo, how did they go about getting that stuff from Shang?\nSimple. The three would jump Shang without talking, all targeting him with an attack. While Shang dealt with one of them, the other two would tear the beast sacks away and run off with the loot.\nAnd that's what they did.\nThe three guys charged at Shang from different angles without saying anything. One was coming from the front while the other two came from the side.\nShang could only attack one of them, and he would be too panicked and surprised to react appropriately. At most, one of them would be injured.\nAs soon as Shang noticed that they had charged at him, he narrowed his eyes.\n'I intimidated them with my actions yesterday, but it didn't have the effect I was hoping for. I was hoping for them to not bother me, but instead, they now take me seriously.'\n'Do I have to go even further? Do I actually have to kill one of them?!' Shang thought.\n'Do I actually have to act like a crazy psychopath before you finally let me alone?!'\n'Fine!'\n'Let's have a gamble!'\nBANG!\nThe floor below Shang's feet shook as he exploded forward with his full speed.\nHe had charged forward just when the three of them began running towards him.\nThere were several meters between all of them, and if Shang had remained on the spot, they would have reached him at the same time.\nHowever, Shang charged forward.\nThe eyes of the guy at the front opened wide in terror.\nHow was Shang so fast with so much weight on his shoulders?!\nShang was way faster than he had expected!\n'You want a psychopath?! Fine! Here you go!' Shang thought with gritted teeth and narrowed eyes.\nThe guy in front of Shang only had a body in the Middle Soldier Realm, and he wasn't fast enough to appropriately react to Shang's attack.\nWith his full speed, Shang jumped forward, the two beast sacks still on his shoulders. Shang had used his full power while accelerating, and with the added weight of the two beast sacks, a terrifying amount of power was behind his charge.\nShang pulled his leg back and kicked forward with all his power.\nThis was a fully-powered attack of someone two levels above the guy in front of Shang.\nThis was essentially an adult releasing a hate-filled kick at a ten-year-old.\nThis was not a joke.\nBANG! CRK!\nThe guy barely managed to put his arms in front of his chest before Shang's kick hit.\nWhen Shang's kick hit the guy's forearms, they immediately broke apart, and that wasn't even the end.\nCRK!\nThe ribcage of the guy broke behind the sheer force of Shang's momentum, his broken ribs digging into his lungs and heart.\nAt that moment, the guy felt like he was in a nightmare.\nWhat was that sound?\nWas the sound of breaking bones coming from him?\nWas the sound of flesh and organs being pierced by bones coming from him?\nWould he survive?\nBANG!\nThe guy's back hit the wall, and his back broke into pieces too.\nHe was as close to death as it could get, and he was lucky for that.\nIf he hadn't been able to block his chest with his arms, his insides would have probably been turned to mush.\nShang noticed that he was still alive and felt some relief.\nThis had been his gamble.\nHe would go in with an attack that would actually kill the guy if he didn't react appropriately.\nHe had to show that he would not be afraid of actually risking his own life by killing someone else.\nHow did the other two react?\nThey quickly arrived behind Shang. They had already expected that one of them would be injured, and they didn't even look at their friend.\nThey had no idea how injured their friend was, and they didn't care right now.\nThey needed the loot!\nShang turned around and let go of his two beast sacks. His two opponents now were diagonally in front of him.\nThe two of them noticed that they couldn't grab Shang's beast sacks since they were behind him now. So, they decided to attack him.\nOne of them unleashed a kick while the other one punched at Shang.\nShang gritted his teeth.\n'They still don't have enough?! Do you want me to go even further?!'\n'Fine!'\n'You win!'",

      "content": "Chapter 124 Crossroads\nShang used both of his hands to grab the leg of the one that tried to kick him, blocking the kick.\nThe fist of the other one hit Shang's head.\nBANG!\nShang angled his head and headbutted the incoming fist.\nShang had a far more powerful body, and his bones were tempered to the maximum for the Soldier Stage. On top of that, the forehead was incredibly hard in general.\nCRK!\nThe hand of the punching guy broke, and Shang felt his brain being scrambled. However, he was used to getting struck in the head from all his fights on Earth. A normal person would become disoriented, but Shang could somewhat keep his mind going.\nBeing able to take a hit was a very important aspect of any kind of fighting sport on Earth.\nShang's eyes burned in fury and stress.\nHe was afraid of ruining his future at this very moment.\nHowever, he needed to do that!\nIf the previous two strikes weren't enough to stop everyone from bothering him, he would have to go even further.\nBANG!\nShang swung the guy he had a hold of and hit the other one.\nA couple of bones inside them broke, and the other guy fell to the ground.\n\"You wanted this!\" Shang shouted with anger.\nWhile this was happening, one of the teachers grabbed the first student and brought him to the Water Mage. The teacher had realized that this student had been incredibly close to death, and if he didn't hurry up, that student might die.\nTeachers allowed fighting between students, but they were also responsible for keeping the students alive if they could prevent their deaths.\nMeanwhile, Shang didn't stop. He continued holding one of the students by the leg, lifted him up, and struck the ground with his full power.\nBANG!\nThe sound of breaking bones could be heard, and even the ground beneath the student broke.\nThe skull of the student cracked open, his brain now visible.\nBANG!\nShang let go of the student and kicked him to the side with his full power, his back and ribs breaking.\nIt was unknown if the student was alive or dead.\n\"You wanted this!\" Shang shouted again.\nThen, he went to the other student on the ground.\nIn the beginning, the watching students were excited about the show, but that excitement had somewhat vanished.\nIf things ended now, it would be a normal fight.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ However, Shang showed no sign of stopping.\nWas he not afraid of being expelled?\n\"I'm sorry!\" the student on the ground shouted in fear, looking into the cold eyes of Shang just before him. \"I won't do it-\"\nBANG!\nShang hit the student's face with his fist.\nThe student on the ground had his face caved in, his skull splintered into pieces at the front.\nBlood bubbled out of the student's face, making his face resemble a puddle.\nThe watching students took a deep breath.\n\"What will it take for you to stop bothering me?!\" Shang shouted with a voice filled with fury.\nShang was no longer acting.\nAt the moment, he was actually filled with fury.\nCurrently, in Shang's mind, the night of the bandits reappeared.\nShang had killed several people during that night, and he had hated himself for letting them get away.\nLetting some of them get away was the very reason why killing the others had become unnecessary.\nHe should have killed all of them!\nHowever, Shang was still a person from Earth, and killing people wasn't normal to him.\nMurderers were seen as monsters on Earth.\nBut Shang also knew that he had to kill people in this world.\nThis conflict of interest stressed and enraged Shang.\nHe didn't want to kill them, but he had to!\nHe had already made a mistake by not killing all the bandits, and he would not commit that same mistake again!\nEarlier, Shang had only planned on bringing them close to death, but after he had actually become enraged, that plan vanished.\nAt this moment, Shang genuinely wanted to kill this student.\nShang lifted his fist again under the shocked eyes of the watching students.\nHey, dude, aren't you going a bit far?\nDo you actually want to be expelled?!\nDo you actually want to kill them?!\nThe night of the bandits replayed again and again in Shang's mind.\nHe remembered all the bandits he had killed, and he remembered their eyes in the last moments.\nTheir eyes had been filled with fear and terror.\nThey were genuinely afraid, and they heavily regretted their actions.\nThey were sorry.\n\"Hlp, hlrpsss,\" the student on the ground tried to shout for help through his crushed face, his arms moving around blindly. His eyes had been crushed, and he could no longer hear anything.\n\"Srssy, Srsshy,\" the student tried to say he was sorry, but his words couldn't be understood.\n\"Mhmmyy!\"\nShang understood that word.\nHe was shouting for his mother.\nAt the moment of death, he was shouting for his mother.\nHe was only a kid.\nHe was only 16 years old.\nWhen Shang heard that word, his insides shook.\nThese were just kids.\nThey only tried to steal from him.\nHe was killing a child right now.\nFor a moment, Shang paused.\nBut then, an explosion of rage appeared inside of him.\n'I'm not on Earth anymore!'\n'Empathy is weakness!'\n'Feelings for others is weakness!'\nThe conflict of emotions only infuriated Shang even more.\nThe more he hated to do something, the angrier he got.\nHe didn't want to do it!\nBut he had to!\nThe ear grating, high-pitched sound of grinding teeth reverberated throughout Shang's body.\nHe hated it!\nHe hated it!\nHe hated it!\nHe hated it!\nShang's mind went blank.\nAt that moment, he felt like time had stopped.\nHe felt like this moment decided his future.\nWas this what he wanted to become?\nWould he kill a kid for trying to steal from him?\nThe three attackers were probably already traumatized by everything, and they would most likely not attack another student for a very, very long time, maybe even forever.\nThey would wake up in cold sweat at night.\nThey might not even decide to hunt beasts in the future since a deep fear of death would be implanted into them on this day.\nIt was enough.\nShang had done enough.\n\"DIE!\" Shang shouted.\nAnd then, Shang punched the student's chest with all of his power.\nIt was like everything was happening in slow-motion to the watching students.\nBANG!\nThe fist hit the student's chest, activating the Magic Runes.\nIf the uniform hadn't blocked the attack, the student would have died.\nThe watching students felt shocked.\nHe had actually done it!\nHe had actually tried to kill him!\nThis was no longer normal!\nIf he killed this student, he would be expelled!\nOn top of that, nearly every student had a somewhat powerful background, and those families would want to find revenge. Without the protection of the academy, Shang would quickly be killed!\nIt was finally done.\nShang had finally managed to intimidate the students into never attacking again.\nMost students would stop attacking someone if that person put them close to death, but that was only most of them.\nBut all of them would stop if they knew that they could actually die.\nShang had accomplished his goal.\nNo one would ever bother him again.\nThe guy on the ground had devolved into trying to shout for his mother.\nWhen Shang heard these shouts, his hatred exploded.\nHe had long since lost his mind in rage.\nThese shouts made him feel bad, and in his rage-filled state, he saw these innocent shouts as an attack.\nHe hated himself for feeling bad.\nAnd he hated the guy on the ground for making him feel bad.\nHe hated him!\nShang lifted his blood-covered fist again.\nTime seemingly stopped for the watching students.\nWas this actually happening?\nWas he actually striking again?\nSome of the older students thought about intervening, but after seeing Shang's face, they decided against it.\nThey could probably fight Shang, but they feared for their own future.\nThey could no longer anticipate Shang's actions since Shang had essentially become a crazy person.\nIf they angered him now, it was possible that he might actually try to kill them.\nWhat then?\nThen, they would have to actually risk their lives.\nWas this worth it?\nWas it worth it to risk their lives for a younger student?\nThe risk was too high.\nThey wouldn't intervene.\nAfter lifting his fist, Shang swung again without waiting.\nTime moved in slow motion.\nShang's fist hit the student's crushed face.\nA loud cracking sound reverberated throughout the academy.\nBlood splashed.\nAnd Shang suddenly lost consciousness as something hit the side of his head.",

      "content": "Chapter 125 Water Mage\nShang opened his eyes.\n'What happened?' he thought with a scrambled mind.\nHe felt the ground beneath his hands.\n'Why am I on the ground?'\nThen, the pain hit Shang.\nHe felt incredible pain coming from his left cheek, and he spit out pieces of blood and bone.\nShang's last memory was of him killing that one student.\nSo, why was he on the ground now?\nShang slowly sat up and looked at his surroundings.\nThe surrounding students were looking at him with mixed expressions.\nSome of the expressions were filled with disgust.\nSome of them were cold.\nSome of them were sympathetic.\nThen, Shang noticed a big bubble of water levitating around ten meters away from him. The bubble of water was where Shang had just been before waking up here.\nHe saw a woman with long blue hair in front of the bubble of water, her hands holding a staff with a blue gem on it.\nShang realized that she was probably the Water Mage responsible for healing students.\nShang heard the whispers of some of the students in the surroundings.\nThey were calling him a maniac.\nThey were calling him a crazy person.\nThey were calling him a monster.\nShang didn't react to these whispers.\nHe had calmed down by now, and a feeling of emptiness had appeared inside his chest.\nFor a long while, Shang only silently sat on the ground, looking absentmindedly in the distance.\n'Did I lose control?' Shang thought.\nEveryone around Shang continued whispering, but Shang didn't hear it. To him, the world was silent.\n'Did I do the right thing?'\nSilence.\n'Did I do the right thing?'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ …\nShang put his head in his hands.\n'I don't know.'\n'If I didn't act like this, they would keep coming for me.'\n'But I also risked my entire future.'\n'I don't know.'\nShang absentmindedly stood up and looked at the bubble of water levitating in the air.\nThe other students were throwing looks at him with all kinds of emotions. Just like Shang, the students also felt a great variety of emotions and uncertainty.\nMost of them believed that Shang was a crazy person, but a couple of them also felt sympathy for him.\nThe ones that felt sympathy for Shang had been in similar situations in the past.\nThey knew what he was going through.\nShang slowly walked over to the bubble of water under the judging gazes of all the other students.\nAfter a silent walk, Shang stopped near the bubble, only looking at it absentmindedly.\n\"Do you regret what you have done?\" asked the Water Mage with a neutral voice. Shang couldn't tell what she thought of his actions. Her voice was completely neutral.\nShang didn't immediately answer.\n\"I don't know,\" Shang answered honestly.\nThe Water Mage frowned as she continued looking at the bubble.\n\"The other two are fine, but this one might not make it,\" she said. \"His brain is too heavily damaged.\"\nSurprisingly, Shang didn't become shocked when he heard these words.\nHe only felt empty.\nIt was like all of this had nothing to do with him.\n\"If he dies, you will be expelled from the academy,\" the Water Mage said. \"Is this what you want?\"\nShang didn't answer for several seconds.\n\"No,\" he answered.\n\"Well, it's no longer up to you. It's up to him and me,\" she said. \"At this moment, your future is no longer in your own hands.\"\n\"You have attempted to kill him, and if I didn't stop you at the very last moment, he would definitely be dead right now. You would be expelled, and his family would come for revenge. I don't believe that you can flee from a squad of General Stage warriors.\"\nShang remained silent as he listened to her.\n\"Were you in control of yourself? Is that what you wanted?\" she asked.\nShang didn't answer for a while.\n\"I don't know,\" Shang answered. \"I don't know if I have been in control or not. At the time, it felt like the right decision.\"\n\"Is it the right decision in hindsight?\" the Water Mage asked.\nShang only looked at the water bubble.\nHis mind went back to that night with the bandits.\nHe had been lenient back then, which made the sacrifices of the beggars meaningless.\nHe hadn't been ruthless enough back then.\n\"They wouldn't have stopped coming for me otherwise,\" Shang said.\n\"So?\" the Water Mage asked.\nThis word hit Shang.\nAll the previous words hadn't hit him, but this dismissive \"so?\" had hit him.\n\"Are you that weak that you fear that you might be beaten up by some students?\" the Water Mage asked.\n\"Are you that weak that you fear that you will lose against a group of Middle Soldier Stage students?\"\nShang felt like his heart was shaking.\n\"So what if they keep going after you? You can just beat them up whenever someone comes. At some point, they will realize that going after you doesn't help them. They never gain anything and always leave with injuries.\"\n\"No one is trying to kill you in here. No one is trying to end your career as a warrior.\"\n\"Today, you have decided to kill a student just because you didn't want to be annoyed anymore. You were not in danger. You were not in danger, but you were still willing to kill a fellow student.\"\n\"For what?\"\nWhen Shang heard that, he looked over at his two beast sacks, which still remained near the street.\n\"For that?\" the Water Mage asked when she noticed Shang looking at his two beast sacks.\n\"So what if they took it? They are students, and they will be in the academy. You saw their faces, and you could have hunted them until they gave everything back with additional compensation. You know what's in there, and you know how much everything is approximately worth. Just make them buy stuff equivalent to what you have lost.\"\n\"However, all of that isn't even necessary since you wouldn't have lost your stuff anyway. You are at the Peak Soldier Stage, and only other Peak Soldier Stage students can stop you, and these students don't care about your meager wealth. These kinds of students are fully focused on reaching the General Stage.\"\nFor the first time, the Water Mage actually looked at Shang.\n\"There was no reason to go that far.\"\nA complex mix of emotions appeared inside Shang's chest.\nWas it regret?\nWas it anger?\nWas it fear?\nHe wasn't sure.\nMaybe it was all of those emotions.\nShang looked at the bubble of water in front of him.\nDid his regret matter?\nHe had already done it.\nAll the regret in the world didn't matter at this moment.\nIf the student died, it didn't matter if he felt regret or not.\nHe would have killed a fellow student, and he would have gotten expelled and hunted.\nFor a while, Shang only watched the Water Mage work.\n\"Will he survive?\" he asked.\nWhen the Water Mage heard that, a smirk appeared on her face.\n\"Of course. Who do you think I am?\" she asked. \"If I weren't confident in saving him, I would have stopped you sooner.\"\n\"Actually, I'm already done.\"\nAfter she said that, the water disappeared, and Shang could see the boy he had nearly killed.\nIt was that one guy that had told Shang that he had come to hell.\nCurrently, he wasn't conscious.\nWhen Shang saw that he was still alive, he felt an unimaginable feeling of relief wash over him.\n\"In my time in the army, I have seen a lot of people like you,\" the Water Mage said. \"Let me give you an important piece of advice.\"\n\"Leave the battlefield on the battlefield. Don't bring the battlefield home.\"\nThis comment hit Shang again.\nNow, Shang actually felt regret.\n\"Anyway, you're still young,\" the Water Mage said as she grabbed one of the legs of the student, pulling him behind her. She seemed to be used to pulling students by the leg. \"You still have a lot of life in front of you, and you still have a lot of learning to do.\"\n\"Remember what you are feeling right now. If you feel consumed by rage again, remember how you have felt at this moment.\"\n\"Don't let your past ruin your future.\"\nAnd after she said that, she pulled the unconscious student into the building.\nShang continued standing at the same spot.\n'Don't let your past ruin your future.'",

      "content": "Chapter 126 In Control\nFor a while, Shang only remained on the spot, thinking.\n'Don't let my past ruin my future,' Shang repeated to himself in his mind.\nTo Shang, these words had a profound meaning.\nWhen he thought about these words, the night with the bandits returned.\n'My past.'\nShang felt like the Water Mage had been right in basically everything she said.\nBut at the same time, Shang also felt that her words were a bit too simple.\n'Ruthlessness is still a necessity in this world. Not dealing with threats might make them even bigger in the future.'\n'Leaving the battlefield on the battlefield, huh?'\n'I'm not sure if there is a place that's not a battlefield in this world.'\n'The teachers say that the academy is safe, but is it truly safe? Have there been no instances of students dying to other students?'\n'I don't believe that.'\nShang looked at the place where the unconscious student had just been.\n'However, was he truly a threat?'\n'Have I not risked the threat becoming an even bigger one by trying to get rid of this small threat? Before my actions, he might have been the only threat, and his threat had been minuscule.'\n'However, what about his family? If their child had received some permanent damage, wouldn't they search for revenge? Wouldn't have this little threat turned into a bigger threat then?'\nFor a while, Shang tried to wrap his head around his new understanding.\nAfter the night of the bandits, Shang's mind had focused on dealing with all the small threats to stop bigger threats from appearing.\nBut today, Shang's method of dealing with small threats had nearly summoned a far bigger threat.\n'Is it right to always deal with smaller threats?'\nSilence.\n'Yes, it obviously is, but what constitutes as dealing with a threat?'\n'The threat had already been dealt with after injuring him heavily. At that point, he had no longer been a threat. After all, he had probably never planned on actually killing me.'\n'He's only a kid that made a mistake. Just like me, he has plenty of time to learn about the consequences of his actions.'\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ 'Teaching him a lesson was the correct course of action, but when the lesson had gone too far, it has caused problems for me.'\n'In the end, I can't only look at the person in front of me but also at the surroundings. Killing him would have only had negative consequences to my life.'\n'I need to learn how to differentiate between different kinds of threats and their dangers.'\nAfter a while of thinking, Shang turned around and slowly grabbed his two beast sacks.\n'I need to pay more attention in the future. I need to be mindful of the consequences of my actions.'\n'This time, I managed to get out of this mess because an outsider intervened. In the future, I am bound to come into a situation where no one is there to stop me from losing control.'\n'I lost control, and I have to accept that I have lost control. Even though my actions have appeared correct at that moment, they have not been correct in retrospect.'\n'I am not emotionless, and I have to keep in mind that anger can cloud my judgment.'\nShang entered the building and went into his room.\nAfter putting the two beast sacks down, Shang sat on his bed, only looking at the ground with furrowed brows.\nHis mind had returned to calm with surprising speed.\nIt was almost like the incident hadn't occurred.\nThe image of the crushed face beneath him shouting for its mother returned for an instant, but Shang's mind quickly shoved it to the side.\n'I need to be more mindful of my future. I can't ruin my future with actions committed in the heat of the moment.'\nThe image returned, but Shang shoved it away again.\n'I need to be in control of myself.'\nThe image returned and vanished again.\n'I need to always remain in control.'\nThe image came back and was pushed away again.\nShang kept repeating to himself that he had to remain in control.\nThe image always returned, but Shang always pushed it away.\nThat wasn't him anymore.\nHe was in control of himself.\nThis was his new past.\nHe would not lose control anymore.\nHe would leave the past in the past.\nShang kept shoving the image into the back of his mind.\nHe wouldn't allow it to ruin his life.\nShang remained sitting on his bed for a while.\nSuddenly, Shang was pulled out of his thoughts when he smelt something disgusting.\nHe furrowed his brows and looked at the source of the smell.\nOne of the two beast sacks.\nShang opened it and looked inside.\nAll the Pest Cat ears had begun to decompose, which was the reason for the horrible smell.\n'Stuff decomposes this quickly in this world? Something like that takes multiple days on Earth,' Shang thought.\n'Well, I am in a different world. I should expect some things to be different.'\n'Anyway, I should deal with this stuff.'\nShang took hold of the beast sack, leaving the other one in the room. Then, Shang left his room and went to the marketplace.\nWhile he walked to the Exchange Hall, every student in front of him stepped out of the way.\nIt was unknown if it was because of Shang's actions or the smell.\nShang didn't notice their actions. He was walking to the Exchange Hall like a machine.\nEventually, Shang arrived in the Exchange Hall and went to one of the counters.\nShang put the beast sack on the counter. \"Pest Cat ears, Swamp Millipede feelers, and Vanishing Snakes,\" he said.\nThe person behind the counter was a General Stage warrior, and he looked at the beast sack with disgust.\n\"Why didn't you bring that earlier?\" he asked with annoyance as he opened the sack. When the sack opened, a disgusting liquid mixed with all kinds of things could be seen. However, the Pest Cat ears and Swamp Millipede feelers were still visible.\n\"I only killed them this morning,' Shang said.\nThe clerk snorted. \"This morning?\" he asked with annoyance. \"Do you think stuff rots to this degree in only a day?\"\n\"That's at least four days old.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 127 The Pest Cat Problem\n\"At least four days?\" Shang asked in shock.\nFour days?\nAccording to Shang's memory, he had killed the beasts just this night. Sure, he had that run-in with these three kids and then spent some time in his room, but not even a full day should have passed since then.\nWas it the effect of his Darkness Mana?\nNo, he felt no Darkness Mana coming from the parts.\nIt was straight up just decomposition.\nThere was only one explanation that made sense.\n'Have I been in my room for three entire days, maybe four?' Shang thought as he looked at the ground.\n'But it hasn't been that long. I only thought about that image for maybe a couple of hours.'\nThe image returned at that moment.\nThe featureless face.\nA viscous pool of blood where the features should be.\nShang immediately pushed it to the back of his mind.\n'I am in control of my thoughts.'\n\"Hey, you!\"\nShang was pulled out of his thoughts as he looked at the clerk in front of him.\n\"I'm pretty good at remembering faces. I haven't seen you before. When did you join?\" he asked with annoyance.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"I joined a couple of days ago. I was here once before, but I talked to another person back then,\" Shang said absentmindedly.\n\"Is this the first time you brought over beast corpses?\" the guy asked.\nShang nodded.\nThen, the guy sighed.\n\"Listen. We have a cutoff date for corpses. Not more than 48 hours are allowed to pass after you have obtained the parts,\" he explained.\nFor some reason, Shang wasn't that shocked or distraught.\nHe had just heard that nearly his entire night of hunting had become worthless.\nYet, for some reason, it didn't feel that important to him.\nHe saw it only as a minor inconvenience.\n\"The reason for that policy is market manipulation,\" the guy explained. \"You've probably noticed it before, but the prices for different corpses change based on demand. Because of that, it's theoretically possible to wait a couple of days to hand over your loot if you think that the price will rise.\"\n\"We don't condone that, which is why that rule is in place. 48 hours is the maximum you can wait, and we are all very experienced with telling the time of death of a beast. If we are uncertain if something falls within the 48-hour window, you have to show proof that it is still within the 48 hours, which is nearly impossible.\"\nThe clerk sighed again.\n\"However, since the price for Pest Cats has sunken in comparison to three days ago, and since you're obviously new, I will make an exception this time, but this will be the only one,\" the man said.\nThe man looked at Shang, expecting him to show an expression of positive surprise.\nBut Shang simply didn't react. It was like he wasn't even there.\n\"Did you hear what I've just said?\" the man asked with a bit more force.\n\"Oh,\" Shang said as his eyes regained their focus. \"Yes, I've heard. One time exception,\" he said.\nThe man furrowed his brows. \"A thanks would be appreciated,\" he said.\n\"Oh, yeah, thanks,\" Shang said. \"Sorry, I'm distracted right now. I'm… I think I'm dealing with something. Not sure.\"\nThe man only sighed in annoyance. \"Follow me. I'm not going through the parts inside the Exchange Hall. The stench is too strong.\"\nShang only nodded absentmindedly as he followed the clerk like a robot.\nThe two of them walked out the back to an open area surrounded by high and thick walls.\nWhen Shang arrived, he couldn't be distracted by his thoughts anymore since he was distracted by something else.\nThe stench.\nThe absolute, pure, abhorrent stench.\nIn front of Shang were hills of ears, all of them from Pest Cats. They were all in varying stages of decomposition.\nThis was the source of the stench.\nThousands of ears of Pest Cats decomposing in an enclosed area.\nShang nearly had to hurl, but he managed to keep himself under control.\n\"The ears are unusable,\" the man said as he poured out the contents of the beast sack in a relatively clean place. \"We are not hunting the Pest Cats because of their resources but because of their numbers. As you can see, the number of Pest Cats is insane. Can you imagine what will happen if we stop hunting them?\"\nSince Shang was no longer distracted anymore, he actually managed to listen to the guy's words.\nSo many ears, every pair representing a dead Pest Cat.\nHow many Pest Cats would be roaming around if all the ones that had died to the students were still alive?\n\"In colder climates, the Pest Cats only mate once per year due to the seasons, but we don't really have strong seasons here,\" the man explained as he threw one pair of ears after the other onto a hill. \"Because of that, the Pest Cats are an especially strong issue here. Without the inhibiting cold, they are multiplying all year round.\"\n\"Due to their numbers, their corpses are also nearly worthless. There is an abundance of Pest Cat corpses, many times higher than the demand. Because of that, Pest Cats are only worth a single Contribution Point. That dissuades hunters from hunting them. After all, they get basically nothing.\"\n\"That's why you students have to kill them. It's too expensive to pay external hunters enough to make them actually hunt them. Most of them wouldn't even bother to bend down to pick up a piece of gold.\"\n\"Pest Cats reach maturity in a matter of days, which is why we have to keep hunting them every single day of the year.\"\n\"126,\" the man suddenly said.\nShang looked at the pile the man had gone through and noticed that all the Pest Cat ears were no longer on it.\n\"126 ears or pairs?\" Shang asked.\n\"Didn't you count?\" the man asked with a bit of annoyance.\n\"Not really,\" Shang said.\n\"It's pairs. You killed 126 Pest Cats, and from the looks of it, you did it all in one day,\" the man said. Surprisingly, his voice had stopped being annoyed.\n\"That's quite impressive,\" he said. \"You seem to be very experienced in hunting.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Shang said.\nAfter that, the man took hold of the feelers of the Swamp Millipedes.\n\"In comparison to Pest Cat ears, Swamp Millipede feelers are actually useful. Sadly, the decomposition is too advanced. You would be getting three Contribution Points per feeler under normal circumstances, but I can't accept them. I can only give you the reward for slaying them.\"\nShang nodded.\nThe man went through the feelers and counted them.\n\"18 Swamp Millipedes,\" he said.\nNow, only two small corpses were left.\nThe man looked at them with an evaluating expression.\n\"Two Vanishing Snakes,\" he said. \"Sadly, the corpses are also in bad condition. You would be getting 100 Contribution Points per corpse normally.\"\n\"It's fine,\" Shang said as he looked to the side. \"It was my fault for waiting that long anyway.\"\nAfter a bit of looking at the feelers and Vanishing Snakes, the guy sighed and threw the feelers onto the hill of ears.\n\"What do you do with the decomposed corpses?\" Shang asked.\n\"Fertilizer,\" the man said. \"Helps a lot in the Farm Line.\"\nThe man stood up and threw the two Vanishing Snakes into a hole at the edge of the area.\nAfter that, he gestured for Shang to follow him back into the Exchange Hall.\nThe two of them quickly arrived, and the clerk tallied everything up.\n\"126 Pest Cats. Right now, they are worth 20 Contribution Points. That's 2,520 Contribution Points.\"\n\"18 Swamp Millipedes without the feelers. The price is always a static 50 Contribution Points. That's 900 Contribution Points.\"\n\"Two Vanishing Snakes. That's 4,000 Contribution Points.\"\n\"Total: 7,420 Contribution Points. Give me your emblem,\" the guy said.\nShang handed over his emblem.\nThe guy put the emblem on a Magic Circle on top of the table. A flash of light appeared, and the guy handed the emblem back to Shang.\n\"Wanna buy something with your new wealth?\" the man asked.\n\"Can I take a look at your Rank Two ores?\" Shang asked.\nThe man smirked. \"Certainly. Which Rank Two ores specifically? Initial? Early? Mid?\"\n\"Depends on the price,\" Shang said.\n\"Sure, let me just give you a rundown of common prices for different levels of Rank Two ores.\"",

There are different prices depending on the Affinity,\" the guy asked.\n\"All nine of the pure ones,\" Shang said.\n\"All nine?\" the man asked with furrowed brows. \"There are only eight. One for no Affinity and seven Pure Affinities. Of course, there are also a couple for Mixed Affinities, but that still wouldn't come to the number nine.\"\n\"Darkness and Light,\" Shang said, his heartbeat speeding up.\nHe knew that it was risky to ask for Light and Darkness Affinities, but he had to get the information from somewhere.\nThe man furrowed his brows.\n\"Seems like you are privy to some sensitive information,\" the man said with a deep voice.\nShang didn't answer.\nThe two remained silent for a while.\nThen, the man sighed.\n\"Fine.\"\n\"Initial Rank Two ores have the following prices.\"\n\"No Affinity: 2,000 Contribution Points.\"\n\"Fire, Earth, Wind, Water Affinity: 2,500 Contribution Points.\"\n\"Ice, Lightning, Metal Affinity: 3,000 Contribution Points.\"\n\"Light Affinity: 1,000 Contribution Points.\"\n\"I don't sell Darkness Affinity ore.\"\nTwo things immediately jumped out to Shang.\n\"Why is the Light Affinity one so cheap?\" Shang asked.\n\"Low demand,\" the man said. \"Rank One Light Affinity ore is mostly used as an efficient light source. Rank Two Light Affinity ore is used as a supporting agent that expedites the healing of injuries, but most people aren't interested in the Initial Rank Two Light Affinity Ore. They want the better stuff.\"\n\"And the Darkness ore? Why do you not sell that?\" Shang asked.\n\"Depends on what you mean with you. You singular or plural?\" the man asked.\nShang's brows furrowed. \"Singular,\" he said.\n\"I don't have access to it.\"\n\"And plural?\" Shang asked.\n\"I don't know. Above my paygrade,\" the man answered.\nShang really didn't like that.\nHe needed Darkness ore, but the Exchange Hall didn't sell it.\nOn top of that, Shang wouldn't dare to walk to the merchants and ask them. He had been willing to talk about the Darkness and Light Affinities in the Exchange Hall since they were directly employed by the academy.\nThe merchants weren't.\nSelling out information about students was probably highly illegal for the employees, but the merchants weren't under this restriction.\nThis was a big problem for Shang.\n\"What about Early Rank Two?\" Shang asked.\n\"Times 1.5 except for the Light Affinity one. That one's times two,\" he said.\n\"And Middle Rank Two?\" Shang asked.\n\"Same thing.\"\nShang did some math in his head while thinking.\n'I think I should go for Middle Rank Two,' Shang thought. 'Astor already has a Late Rank Two weapon, and he is clearly someone very dedicated to his weapon. Nearly everyone else will probably only have an Early or Middle Rank Two weapon. If I want to train my techniques, I need a weapon on the same level as everyone else.'\n'So, I need a Middle Rank Two weapon.'\n'I need seven units of ore for my weapon, but I want it to have a proper balance. Because of that, I need to actually buy eight units, two for each of my Affinities.'\n'That comes to 32,500 Contribution Points, and I'm still missing the Darkness ore.'\n'Luckily, I still have a lot of gold, which means I don't have to only buy from the Exchange Hall.'\n'But I still need to keep my Affinity a secret. The best way to accomplish that is to buy two of everything.'\n'But that's not feasible with my current wealth. The longer I don't have a usable weapon, the more time I waste by not being able to properly train my techniques.'\nThe man had already started doing something else. He was used to students taking several minutes to make their decisions sometimes.\nShang was going through several possible ways to reduce his cost.\n'I need to make one Affinity public. The only reason why I have to keep my Affinity secret is because of the added Darkness and Light Affinities. There are probably a couple of people that have a Temperature Affinity, but it should still be very rare. If I go public with a Temperature Affinity, I will probably be under scrutiny by a lot of outsiders.'\n'I should go public with my Ice Affinity.'\n'However, before doing that, I have to get the Fire, Darkness, and Light Affinity ore in secret. Then, I will go public with my Ice Affinity and buy the ore. With that, I would have all the ore I need. After getting the Ice Affinity ore, I can upgrade my weapon, and everyone will believe that I used the Ice Affinity ore I've just bought.'\n\"Is there a way to use Light Affinity ore to speed up training?\" Shang asked.\nThe man stopped what he was doing and looked at Shang. \"Well, when talking about these stones, we don't generally refer to them as Light Affinity ore,\" he said.\nShang lifted an eyebrow.\n\"They are known as Healing Stones, and they have grades. Grade One Healing Stones refer to Initial Rank Two Light Affinity ore. Grade Two refers to Early Rank Two and so on.\"\n\"They are usually put into a room in which you are training. The healing aura of the Healing Stones makes your body heal faster, which allows you to train with more risk and quicker. That's also why they are being sold,\" the man explained.\n\"No one will bat an eye if someone buys Healing Stones,\" the man added.\nShang showed no reaction.\n\"However, buying Darkness ore would pull up a lot of questions,\" the man said.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Especially since that's officially contraband.\"\n\"Contraband?\" Shang asked.\n\"Illegal goods. Darkness ore can be used in a variety of ways to kill someone. A stone at the bottom of medicine can pull out all the life force of said medicine. If someone relies on that medicine to save their life and it doesn't work, chances are high they would die.\"\n\"Using a stone in a liquid with compatible ingredients could even poison someone.\"\n\"That's also the reason why I don't sell them,\" the man said. \"You've seen the big crystals above the city gates? No normal person can smuggle that stuff in. You would have to be someone with a lot of prestige, like a True Mage or a Commander Stage warrior, to smuggle that stuff in successfully.\"\n\"Of course, most of them wouldn't take the risk. The risk is far too high for this little bit of reward. They would rather kill a Commander Stage beast. That's a many, many times higher payoff for less risk.\"\n\"You would need someone that's on that level who is willing to take that risk for you,\" the man said.\nShang furrowed his brows.\n\"I would like to buy two Grade Three Healing Stones,\" Shang said.\n\"Sure,\" the man said with a smirk.\nHe walked to the back of the Exchange Hall and came back with a brown bag.\nWhen Shang saw the brown bag, his eyes shone.\nHe had seen several people get their wares, and they had always received them without any hiding.\nThis guy was obviously helping Shang.\n\"Students, as well as teachers, get most of their stuff from us,\" the man said. \"However, they are all customers, and customers don't have access to the information of other customers. This policy exists under the order of the dean, and only the dean can overwrite it.\"\nWhen Shang heard that, his eyes shone again.\nSeveral pieces of scattered information just clicked together.\n\"Thank you,\" Shang said after paying.\n\"Only doing my job,\" the man said with a smile.\nShang said his goodbyes and left the building.\n'I should repay him in the future.'\n'He dropped enough hints for me to realize where I can get Darkness Affinity ore.'\n'Only an idiot wouldn't be able to combine the clues.'",

      "content": "Chapter 129 Darkness Affinity\nShang sat down in one of many chairs inside one of the rooms on the third floor of the main building.\nSeveral other students were with Shang in the room, and a couple of them threw worried glances at him while whispering to their neighbors, who then also shot a look at Shang.\nShang tried to ignore it, but it was way too obvious what they were talking about.\nAll the students in the room were 16 and 17 years old, except for Shang.\nA couple of minutes of whispering later, the teacher entered.\nShe looked to be in her late twenties, and she had long black hair, her eyes detached and distant.\nShe inspected everyone present, and her gaze lingered a bit longer on Shang.\n\"Let's start class,\" she announced.\nEveryone quieted down.\nThen, Teacher Niria began her lesson.\nThis afternoon, she was teaching the class about the northeastern forest.\nShe talked about Swamp Millipedes and Vanishing Snakes, but most of all, she talked about the Empress Cobra Zone. The northeastern forest was adjacent to the Empress Cobra Zone, and there was a high likelihood that the students would find some beasts from there in the northeastern forest.\nShe talked about the climate and how the beasts behaved.\nAnd that was already it for the lesson.\nThere was so much to learn about the northeastern forest that it couldn't be covered in just one lesson. Today, she had only talked about the special things one could expect to come across in the northeastern forest. The local flora and fauna would be taught in different lessons.\nAfter the lesson was finished, several students walked up to teacher Niria to ask questions, which she very quickly answered with the least words possible.\nSeveral minutes later, all the students had left.\nThat was when Shang walked up to her.\n\"Do you have a question?\" teacher Niria asked with practiced ease.\n\"My question would be if it is safe for me to speak right now,\" Shang said.\nTeacher Niria's eyes narrowed ever so slightly. \"Follow me,\" she ordered.\nShang and Teacher Niria left the room and then the building.\nAfter walking towards the north, past nearly all of the training fields, teacher Niria stopped. At the moment, Shang and teacher Niria were directly beneath the northwestern wall.\n\"Ask,\" teacher Niria ordered. \"No one can hear us.\"\nShang took a deep breath.\nThis was it.\nHe hoped that he hadn't made a mistake in his deduction.\n\"I have a Darkness Affinity,\" he said.\n\"And why would I care?\" teacher Niria directly asked, like she had seen Shang's words coming.\n\"Because we are connected,\" Shang said.\n\"How so?\" she asked coldly.\n\"You also have a Darkness Affinity.\"\n\"What makes you think so?\" she asked.\n\"Several things,\" Shang said before he started rattling down his thoughts.\n\"Back when you inspected the corpse, you said that we are connected. However, you and I met for the first time back then. That means that the corpse told you something about me.\"\nTeacher Niria let Shang continue without interrupting.\n\"You even helped me far more than is to be expected of a teacher.\"\n\"However, that isn't the only reason I have found out. The clerk in the Curio Trinket also made an interesting comment based on the corpse.\"\nTeacher Niria frowned. \"What did he say?\" she asked.\n\"I only told him that you have sent me, nothing more. Yet, when he inspected the corpse, he said, of his own volition, that this snake has definitely been killed by you. He said your handiwork is unmistakable.\"\n\"Of course, I know that I have killed the snake. However, how can he be so sure that you killed it, not me?\"\n\"Are we two the only ones in the entire city that use swords? I don't think so.\"\n\"Do you have access to call upon the progeny of the Storm Eagle? I don't think so.\"\n\"So, if the cut on its side and the killing blow were not the giveaways, that only leaves one thing. The weakened tail.\"\n\"Nearly the entire tail was cut off, but there is still quite a bit of weakened flesh near its back. An experienced eye will notice it. You noticed it, and the clerk noticed it too.\"\n\"Alright,\" teacher Niria said. \"That's nice and all, but why did you want to talk to me? Did you only want me to listen to your ramblings?\"\nShang took a deep breath.\n\"I need your help,\" he said.\n\"For what?\"\n\"Middle Rank Two Darkness Affinity ore,\" Shang said.\n\"How much?\" teacher Niria asked.\n\"Two units.\"\n\"Impossible,\" she answered.\nThat threw Shang for a loop.\nHe was sure that she was the person he should contact.\nBack in the Exchange Hall, the clerk had given him several hints.\nHe had said that it needed someone in the Commander Stage to get the ore. On top of that, it would be a major risk. So, the person should have a strong connection with Shang.\nWith that sentence, the clerk had told Shang that he needed to get a Commander Stage warrior he could trust.\nThen, the clerk had said that he had to keep the information of both students and teachers a secret.\nWith that, he was telling Shang that he should go to a teacher.\nAdding the teachers into the sentence was useless. He could have simply said that the students' information would be hidden from everyone.\nLastly, he said that only the dean could check up on information in the Exchange Hall.\nThat meant that Shang only needed to get the Darkness ore from the teacher, and he could buy anything he needed from the Exchange Hall.\nWell, as long as the dean wasn't Shang's enemy, but if he were, Shang would have bigger problems.\nIn short, the clerk had indirectly told Shang that there was a teacher in the school that was willing to do something like that. However, it was up to Shang to find them.\n\"Why is it impossible?\" Shang asked.\n\"You haven't shown me the basic amount of respect required for asking me for help,\" she said.\n\"The basic amount of respect?\" Shang asked in confusion.\nWhat did she mean by that?\nHe had been polite, hadn't he?\nWhat did she mean?\nShe looked at Shang for a bit longer before slowly walking away.\n\"You can come talk to me again when you are serious,\" she said.\nShang's mind was going wild.\nWhat did she mean?\nDid she want a bribe?\nNo, she didn't seem like a person that wanted to be bribed.\nShe also didn't seem like a person that liked to play political games.\nShe also didn't seem like the deceiving kind.\n'Wait, she doesn't seem like the deceiving kind?' Shang thought.\n'If someone weaker than me asked for my help, and I were theoretically willing to help them, what would be the least I would want them to do?'\nThat's when it hit Shang.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ However, it was risky, very risky.\nThat also explained teacher Niria's earlier words.\nWhen Shang had said that he wanted Darkness ore, she hadn't immediately said that it was impossible.\nNo, before that, she asked how much he needed.\nOnly when he stated the amount did she say that it was impossible.\nShang took a deep breath.\n\"I have more than only a Darkness Affinity,\" Shang said.\nTeacher Niria stopped.\nThen, she walked back to her previous spot.\n\"Continue,\" she said.\nThe least Shang would want from such a person was honesty.\nThey should at least be honest with him.",

      "content": "Chapter 130 Not An Affinity\nShang took a deep breath. It was definitely a huge risk to tell teacher Niria about his one-of-a-kind Affinity.\nHowever, this was still the safest bet.\nFirst of all, teacher Niria already knew that Shang had more than just a Darkness Affinity, which meant that she already knew that his Affinity had to be very special.\nSecond, teacher Niria had already indirectly taken the first step. If she hadn't given Shang several hints, he would have never found out that teacher Niria had a Darkness Affinity. In a way, she had tested Shang's intellect and had also shown him her trust.\nShe had taken the first step by unveiling her own secret.\nOn top of that, teacher Niria was probably the only person that could help Shang without too much risk.\nThe dean?\nShang doubted that the dean would help him. The dean seemed like a very strict parent to Shang. If Shang asked him for help in that matter, not only would the dean not help him, but he would probably even call Shang weak.\nIt was Shang's responsibility to become more powerful. The fact that he was allowed to study in this academy was already more than enough help.\n\"At the moment, I have four Pure Affinities,\" Shang said.\n\"That's impossible,\" teacher Niria said, \"but I don't believe you're lying. Prove it.\"\nShang pointed to the side, and his arm shone with a bit of light for a second. Luckily, they were alone right now. Shang trusted in teacher Niria's capability to notice if someone tried to spy on them.\nTeacher Niria hadn't been shocked by the light. She had already anticipated that Shang also had a Light Affinity.\nWhy?\nBecause she knew that Shang must have a Mixed Affinity that couldn't be covered with Mixed materials, like a Poison Affinity. In her mind, a fusion of Light and Darkness made the most sense.\nHowever, when teacher Niria saw Shang's left arm, her eyes narrowed.\nShang's left arm had shriveled up.\nThis definitely wasn't normal.\n\"I thought you had a Mixed Affinity,\" she said. \"Seems like I have been mistaken.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Shang asked, interested in her thoughts.\n\"Affinities don't damage the user,\" she said. \"After all, an Affinity is something that you have great compatibility with. Someone with a Fire Affinity won't be damaged by fire as much and not at all by their own fire.\"\n\"However, your arm has been damaged by the release of Light Mana. That is not normal,\" she said.\n\"How would that normally work?\" Shang asked.\n\"Someone with a Light Affinity can heal others and themselves,\" she explained. \"They convert the Mana in their body and mind into Light Mana. This means that they can unleash Light Mana as long as they have Neutral Mana left in their body.\"\n\"But you have used your own life energy, or by the looks of it, the life energy in your left arm. This is not normal. Affinities always only make use of the saved-up Mana in your body and mind, not your life energy.\"\nTeacher Niria walked forward and held her hand out for Shang. \"Go heal your arm. You might as well show me the peculiarities of your Darkness Affinity.\"\nShang nodded and took hold of teacher Niria's arm. Then, he used his Darkness Absorb to absorb a bit of her life energy.\n\"I'm not a weakling,\" she commented. \"I want to see if your Darkness Affinity also has a negative side-effect. If it has one, show me.\"\nShang nodded and absorbed more of teacher Niria's life energy.\nShang's arm swelled up, and he let go of her.\nWhen teacher Niria saw Shang's left arm, her eyebrows furrowed. \"Just as expected, you directly absorb life energy without converting it to Mana.\"\n\"The balance of Life Energy inside your body is important. Too little, and you will slowly succumb to many tiny injuries appearing all over your body. Too much, and you will explode.\"\nShang's arm was close to exploding, but it hadn't crossed the threshold yet.\n\"Your Darkness and Light Affinities have transformed into a control over life energy,\" teacher Niria said as she combed her long hair with her fingers, her eyes distant. \"However, the most shocking part is that your two Affinities do not interact with Mana at all, which should be impossible.\"\n\"All Affinities interact with Mana. Mana is the very medium that makes these transformations possible. Yet, your Light and Darkness Affinities don't interact with it at all.\"\nAt that moment, Shang pointed his left arm to the side.\nThen, he released a Fire Blast.\nTeacher Niria was pulled out of her thoughts as she felt a large amount of Fire Mana leave Shang's body.\nAt the same time, she also noticed that Shang's left arm was now filled with Ice Mana.\nThen, Shang unleashed an Ice Blast.\nShang's arm got severely injured, but the added life energy inside his left arm was being used up to heal it now.\nIn just a single second, Shang's left arm was in its peak condition again.\nTeacher Niria needed a long time to react after witnessing Shang's abilities.\n\"Shocking,\" she whispered. \"Your Fire and Ice Affinities also don't interact with the Mana inside your body. They only interact with the Mana in the surroundings.\"\nTeacher Niria narrowed her eyes as she combed her hair. \"This should be impossible. Affinities are precisely the transformation of your own Mana into different Mana. Yet, your four Affinities don't touch your Mana at all.\"\n\"In a way, this doesn't even conform to the definition of an Affinity.\"\n\"According to the definition of an Affinity, your Affinity doesn't belong to you. After all, it doesn't interact with your Mana.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"From what I've seen, you basically only count as a medium. You are something that transforms the Mana of your surroundings into something else.\"\n\"Maybe you are the Affinity?\"\nShang felt like teacher Niria was onto something, but he also wasn't sure what she was thinking about. Her words were too abstract.\n\"Or maybe, since your Affinity doesn't interact with your Mana but the Mana of the world, this Affinity is the world's Affinity.\"\n\"And you're only its hand.\"",

I was only trying to make sense of everything.\"\n\"Does the dean know?\" teacher Niria suddenly asked.\n\"Yes,\" Shang said. \"He is the one that allowed me to unearth my Affinities in the first place.\"\n\"That makes sense,\" teacher Niria said. \"From what I can tell, you have absorbed four different Pure Mana Sources, and I don't think you have the money to buy even one of them. Additionally, Light and Darkness Mana Sources are very rare but also relatively worthless. There simply is no demand for them, which means that whoever happens to carry some of them with them doesn't even remotely have to worry about Commander Stage beasts.\"\n\"What are his thoughts?\" teacher Niria asked.\nAt that moment, Shang felt a bit uncertain.\nYes, he had decided to trust teacher Niria, but he also hadn't forgotten how the dean had acted.\nThe dean valued honesty greatly, but he also didn't betray his friend, Duke Whirlwind.\n\"I don't want to say,\" Shang said with a sigh. \"I don't think it's my place to say what the dean thinks.\"\nTeacher Niria nodded. \"That's a good quality to have. If you had told me what the dean has said, my trust in you would have diminished.\"\n\"Anyway,\" teacher Niria said as she walked closer to Shang. \"You said you needed two pieces of Middle Rank Two Darkness Affinity ore, correct?\"\nShang nodded. \"Yes. As you have seen, I have four Affinities, and I want to keep everything balanced. My sword needs seven pieces of ore, which means I need two of each.\"\n\"And how do you plan on creating that weapon?\" teacher Niria asked. \"I don't believe that any blacksmith would know how to fuse four different kinds of Pure Affinity ore together. Additionally, creating weapons out of Darkness and Light Affinity ore is already something nearly no blacksmith can do.\"\n\"I have a solution to that, but I can't tell you,\" Shang said.\nTeacher Niria only looked at Shang for a bit.\n\"Fine,\" she said. \"1,000 gold per unit.\"\nShang took a deep breath.\n1,000 gold?!\n\"That's a lot,\" Shang commented.\n\"It's what you have,\" she said. \"Don't think that I am extorting you. If you were to pay the actual price, you would need to pay over 10,000 gold. I am essentially gifting the ore to you at that price.\"\n\"Furthermore, if you acted intelligently, you should have received 2,200 gold from the Curio Trinket.\"\nShang sighed.\n\"Thank you. I will accept,\" he said.\nTeacher Niria nodded. \"Let's go.\"\n\"To where?\" Shang asked.\n\"To your room,\" she answered. \"We can't make such a trade in public. I can hide the effects of the ore, but you can't. If you openly walk around with the ore, you will be caught sooner or later.\"\n\"Wait! Does that mean that you already have the ore in your possession?\" Shang asked in surprise.\nTeacher Niria nodded.\nShang was a bit surprised that teacher Niria already had the ore with her, but he didn't complain.\nThe two of them walked back to the main building under the gazes of a couple of students.\nHadn't those two already talked to each other a couple of days ago?\nWhat was going on?\nShang felt uncomfortable under the gazes of everyone, and he hoped that they didn't misinterpret teacher Niria's intentions.\nBut Shang was worrying over nothing.\nIt was forbidden for teachers to get into a relationship with students, and that rule was ironclad.\nIf teacher Niria didn't want to be fired, she would never start a relationship with a student.\nBecause of that, basically no one suspected the two of them of hooking up.\nWhen teacher Niria entered Shang's room, a couple of suspicions appeared in the students' minds.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Maybe teacher Niria was giving Shang a private lesson? Maybe, after taking a look at one of the corpses Shang brought back, she took him under her wing?\nOr maybe teacher Niria was trying to deal with Shang's obvious problems? After all, Shang had nearly killed a student recently.\nAs the two of them entered the room, Shang pointed at his two big sacks of gold.\nSHING!\nThe two sacks vanished, and a small, inconspicuous sack appeared in their place.\nShang immediately felt Darkness Mana coming from them.\n\"Keep the Light ore and the Darkness ore at separate parts of the room,\" she said. \"You don't want them to consume each other's Mana.\"\nShang did just that, and after he was done, he looked at teacher Niria again.\n\"Thanks,\" Shang said.\nTeacher Niria only nodded before she sat down on Shang's bed.\nThis surprised and confused Shang. \"You want to stay?\" Shang asked.\n\"If I leave right now, everyone will get suspicious. I need to appear like I'm giving you a private lesson. I'm already under a lot of scrutiny based on my Affinity, and I can't be careless,\" she said.\nShang nodded. \"That makes sense.\"\nAfter that sentence, silence returned to the room.\nTeacher Niria was seemingly looking at a random wall of the room with concentration in her eyes.\nShe was probably thinking about something.\nShang noticed that she wasn't interested in talking, and soon enough, he became bored.\n'I can't just sit around,' Shang thought as he pushed the bloody face out of his vision again. 'I need to distract myself.'\nShang glanced at teacher Niria. 'However, it would be awkward to train in front of her. The ventilation in the room is horrible, and if I start sweating, it will stink up the entire place.'\n'Isn't there something else I can do?'\nShang thought back to what he had thought about while being in the northeastern forest.\n'Right! I wanted to try if I could concentrate my Affinity Abilities! If I can manage to release a concentrated beam of fire or ice, I have another way to attack my opponent.'\n'Speaking of, do Darkness and Light have something similar?'\n'How would I even go about training it?'\nAnd at that moment, Shang glanced at teacher Niria.\n\"Is there a way to change the way I can use my Darkness Affinity?\" Shang asked.\nTeacher Niria looked away from the wall and at Shang. \"You want a lesson?\" she asked.\n\"No, no!\" Shang quickly said. Teacher Niria had already helped him a lot, and he wouldn't want to impose. \"I only want to know if it's possible.\"\nTeacher Niria furrowed her brows and looked back at the wall.\n\"Well, I need to appear like I'm giving you a lesson. Might as well actually give you one,\" she said.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Shang said.\n\"It's fine,\" teacher Niria answered. \"You are in the academy to learn, and you don't really have any way of learning about the Darkness Affinity without my help. I'm basically the only one that can teach you, and it's my job as a teacher to help you.\"\n\"Sit on the ground in front of me,\" she ordered.\nShang nodded and sat down.\n\"Concentrate on the Darkness Affinity ore in the corner of the room. Try to feel it, but don't try to manipulate it,\" she said.\nThen, over the next minutes, she slowly guided Shang into a state of meditation.\nOver the next three hours, she told Shang how to train his Darkness Affinity and what he could do with it.",

      "content": "Chapter 132 Refined Uses\nAfter three hours, teacher Niria left Shang's room while Shang continued sitting on the ground.\n'I should have asked the teachers earlier on how to train my Affinities,' Shang thought. 'There are so many applications.'\nWhat had Shang learned about the Darkness Affinity?\nWell, there were several things he had learned.\nFor example, Shang had learned that he could unleash his Darkness Affinity on other parts of his body but with diminished effects.\nIf his left arm were severely damaged, he could theoretically use his right arm or his legs to absorb the enemy's life force. Of course, the absorption would be far weaker, and the life force would need to travel through the body to the left arm.\nSure, that wouldn't be such a big issue with the Darkness Affinity, but it would be a problem for his other three Affinities. If a line of Ice Mana went through Shang's entire body, for example, he would severely injure his organs. Basically destroying his left arm wasn't such a big issue, but nearly destroying his organs would be.\nShang wasn't certain how to train his other Affinities, but he guessed that he could learn to train them by extrapolating the methods he had used to get in touch with his Darkness Affinity.\nThe special kind of meditation Shang had entered allowed him to enter a world of darkness. Of course, that world wasn't real, and it was only a representation of his mastery of Darkness Mana.\nBut in that world, Shang had it way easier to control the Darkness Mana. His sensitivity had spiked, and the Darkness Mana followed his will to a certain degree.\nOf course, that was only relative. His control over Darkness Mana was better in that world, but it definitely wasn't good.\nBut it helped Shang in getting more familiar with Darkness Mana.\nWhat had surprised him was when teacher Niria had told Shang that this was the kind of meditation Mages learned spells with. They entered this world to get more familiar with their Element. Then, they would follow certain guidelines on how to manipulate the Mana.\nWhen the Mage was able to perfectly emulate the Mana manipulation and Mana movement without the meditation, they would have learned a spell.\nOf course, that took a long time and a lot of work. On top of that, it needed these guidelines, which were the instruction manuals for spells.\nSadly, Shang couldn't learn any spells. He had a warrior's body, which made his mind far too weak and slow. In a sense, Shang's mind was on the level of an Initial Apprentice, the equivalent of an Initial Soldier Stage warrior.\nApprentices on that level didn't even have the ability to learn spells. Their sensitivity to Mana was just too weak.\nBut the meditation technique was still useful to Shang since it opened the door to actually controlling his Affinity.\nShang wouldn't be able to do many complex things with his Darkness Affinity for a long time, but with enough training, he could learn additional attacks.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Teacher Niria told him that one of the more common attacks with the Darkness Affinity was an instantaneous burst of absorption combined with a punch.\nAs soon as the punch hit, the life energy at the spot where the punch hit the enemy would be sucked out, severely weakening their defense. The power of the punch would then have a devastating effect.\nSadly, this more common attack only became common in the General Stage.\nThere was also a way to infuse one's weapon with Darkness Mana, which would then draw the life energy out of the target it struck.\nHowever, that attack needed three requisites.\nFirst, one needed a weapon that could absorb Darkness Mana.\nSecond, one needed to have great control over Darkness Mana.\nThird, one needed to be in the General Stage since a warrior could only release their inherent Mana into the surroundings at that Stage.\nTeacher Niria had said that this was a Mage warrior technique. Getting one's sensitivity of one's Affinity to that level required a lot of work and time, and most warriors would rather do something else.\nShang would have it especially difficult since he had a warrior's body.\nFunnily enough, that also meant that Darkness Affinity ore was really not important for Shang.\nIt wouldn't increase his Battle-Strength since he couldn't use the effect.\nLuckily, Shang had a potential workaround. Although, it was questionable if it worked.\nAt the moment, Shang's Darkness Absorb simply summoned Darkness Mana inside his left arm. Darkness Mana pulled life energy towards it wherever it existed, which was how the Darkness Absorb worked.\nThe theoretical workaround was for Shang to summon the Darkness Mana and shoot it out of his arm, similar to his Ice and Fire Blasts.\nOf course, that would also come with problems.\nAs soon as the Darkness Mana left Shang, it would pull Shang's life energy with it. That would basically give it the same drawback as Shang's Light Burst.\nBut if Shang could deal with that drawback, he could theoretically blast his weapon with Darkness Mana and then attack the enemy. That would have a very similar effect to that Mage warrior technique without the troublesome training.\nThere were also other applications for Darkness Mana. For example, one could also infuse the enemy with Darkness Mana and sabotage their body. That effect was even more destructive than Darkness Absorb.\nHowever, the user wouldn't get anything out of it. Darkness Absorb would give Shang life energy, but if he used that other technique, he wouldn't gain anything. Even worse, he would need to spend his own life energy to infuse his enemy with Darkness Mana.\nBut the effect would be devastating. It would have a similar effect to a Vanishing Snake's bite. The enemy's body would very quickly fall apart in their insides.\nOf course, all of this was far in the future. Right now, Shang didn't even have the ability to shape his Darkness Mana into another shape. He had only just taken his first steps in terms of Mana manipulation.\nAnd all of that was only for his Darkness Affinity.\nHe had three more.\nShang hadn't received teaching in his other Affinities, but he could guess a couple of things he could theoretically do.\nAfter realizing that Shang could theoretically also expel his Darkness Mana, he used the same logic with his Light Affinity but in reverse.\nHe normally shot out Light Mana with his Light Burst.\nSo, what if he absorbed it?\nWouldn't he then get life energy?\nThat should be possible.\nOf course, the density of Light Mana in the surroundings wasn't very high, and during the night, it was almost not present at all.\nShang could probably expedite his healing while sitting in sunlight, but his absorption of Light Mana was definitely lacking.\nIf he managed to manipulate light with way more skill, he could probably strengthen the absorption of Light Mana by a lot, but just like with his Darkness Mana, it would take a long time of meditation.\nLuckily, Fire and Ice Affinities had way more applications.\nFire Blades, Ice Blades, Fire Lasers, Ice Beams, Fireballs, Ice Shields, and so on.\nThere were a lot of possibilities.\nHowever, there was just one problem.\nBasically all of these applications were spells…\nAnd Shang couldn't learn any spells.",

      "content": "Chapter 133 This World\nShang had thought that he could use his Affinity in many different ways, and sure, there certainly were more refined techniques.\nSadly, the very refined techniques were just spells.\nThe ability to push the complexity of one's Affinity to the peak was literally what a spell was.\nAt most, Shang could slightly alter the use of his Mana.\nWith enough training, he could shoot out Darkness Mana.\nWith enough training, he could concentrate the ice and fire.\nWith enough training, he could absorb the light.\nBut that was about it. Anything more complex would be walking into the territory of spells.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ Even more, Shang would probably need several months of training just to gain the control to unleash these slightly more refined uses of his Affinities. If he were to attempt to learn the most basic spells, Shang would need literal years to even learn the easiest one.\nWhy?\nBecause of his mind.\nBy increasing the power of the mind, one would gain a far greater connection with their Affinity, and one would be able to concentrate with far more intensity and for longer.\nAnd Shang couldn't train his mind due to his warrior's body.\n'At least I now have something I can do in my downtime. If I can't properly train in techniques, I can always focus on my Affinities. It's definitely not my priority since it doesn't increase my Battle-Strength by a lot, but it's better than doing nothing.'\n'Anyway, I now have my Darkness ore and Light ore. I'm only missing two units of Fire ore and Ice ore. My priority should be to get those first.'\n'Let's see. I have 227 gold and 3,440 Contribution Points. Fire costs 5,500 Contribution Points per unit, and Ice costs 6,750 Contribution Points per unit.'\n' 24,500 Contribution Points. That's what I need. Based on my last excursion, that should be three days of hunting in the northeastern forest.'\nShang scratched his chin in thought.\n'However, I don't want to buy absolutely everything in the Exchange Hall. Sure, my information is being protected, but if the stuff I'm buying is too strange, one of the clerks might believe that information about me is worth more than their job.'\n'The previous clerk probably believes I have a Light Affinity, but that's not enough for him to risk his life. Of course, when I inevitably unveil my Ice Affinity, he might get suspicious, but that doesn't actually matter that much.'\n'After all, there is a very easy and logical reason for why I bought Light ore.'\n'I have a friend with a Light Affinity, and they don't want to show themselves,' Shang thought with a smirk.\n'As long as I'm only buying weird ore once, that excuse works, but that also means that I can only get Ice Affinity ore from the Exchange Hall, which means I have to get the Fire Affinity ore from one of the normal merchants.'\n'So, if I only want two Units of Ice Affinity ore, I only need a bit more than 10,000 Contribution Points. That's like five Vanishing Snakes. For the Fire ore, I need gold since I believe that I don't have enough gold right now to buy everything I need.'\nShang nodded as he finalized his plan and stood up.\nNight had already arrived. Teacher Niria's lesson about beasts was in the afternoon, and with the three added hours of personal teaching, it was now night.\n'No time like the present!'\nShang grabbed an empty beast sack, left his room, and jogged towards the city.\nBy now, the streets were nearly empty as everyone was finishing up for the day. In just two more hours, the streets would be dead silent again.\nShang just barely managed to get through the big gates before they closed, the guards shouting at him with annoyance.\nAfter leaving the city, Shang accelerated to a full sprint as he ran down the long street.\nThe wind went through Shang's hair.\nHe loved that feeling.\nWhenever Shang ran, he felt so free. Back on Earth, he had only been able to reach such speeds with a vehicle, but here, he could just run.\nEven more, after surviving for months in the wilderness, Shang had learned how to live without society. If he wanted, he could simply continue running and never turn back.\nHe would be able to survive and still grow more powerful.\nHe was not bound by the place where he currently was.\nThis was something unachievable on Earth.\nOn Earth, one had a residence, belongings, money, insurance, family, a job, responsibilities, and so on.\nIf one decided to completely abandon society, one would have to live in the wilderness, which would bring a lot of problems.\nUnclean water, which would endanger one's health.\nCold temperatures.\nParasites.\nDisease.\nFood problems.\nAll of these things were no issue for Shang. His body was powerful enough that all of these things didn't matter.\nAnd even more, on Earth, it was very hard to rejoin society after abandoning it. The paperwork was monumental.\nHere, it wasn't very difficult.\nThis world represented freedom, and only after living on Earth for so long could Shang appreciate the freedom this world provided.\nFor everyone else, this was just normal, but for Shang, this was special.\nShang loved this world.\nAt that moment, the image of the featureless, bloody face returned.\nShang only pushed it to the side.\nHe had gotten used to pushing it to the side.\nAfter running for a while, Shang reached the northeastern forest. He had seen a couple of big dogs on the way, but they only looked at him with a bit of curiosity.\nShang quickly reached the northeastern forest and jumped onto a tree. After that, Shang stopped running on the ground and simply jumped from tree to tree.\nHe wanted to continue running, but Shang had already learned that he couldn't be reckless inside the northeastern forest.\nShang's excitement made way for concentration and care as his expression changed into a solemn one.\nAfter jumping for a bit, Shang saw a Swamp Millipede in the distance. Without stopping, Shang jumped from tree to tree until he came to the closest one.\nShang directly jumped at the Swamp Millipede.\nThe Swamp Millipede had felt the vibrations of Shang's jumps since he hadn't been very stealthy at all and looked over.\nBANG!\nShang unleashed a Fire Blast to shoot himself at the Swamp Millipede.\nSHING!\nThe Swamp Millipede was decapitated, and Shang quickly cut off its feelers while unleashing a small Ice Blast to slightly heat up his nearly frozen arm again. As long as he didn't force the temperature to jump too wildly, his arm wouldn't be damaged that much.\nWith that method, Shang could use one Blast per beast without running out of Mana to regenerate his left arm. Each Blast allowed Shang to speed up a lot in the air, essentially making him move even faster than a Soldier Stage warrior.\nEvery time Shang unleashed a Fire Blast, he reached the speed of an Initial General Stage warrior for just one charge.\nNearly no beast in the northeastern forest could react to that.\nEven more, his Fire Blast allowed Shang to reposition himself in the sky. If a beast noticed Shang's jump and moved to the side, Shang could simply charge at their new position with incredible speeds.\nThe beasts were helpless.\nShang was not fighting.\nHe was hunting.",

      "content": "Chapter 134 Ice Ore\nShang stood on the ground in the middle of the northeastern forest, his eyes showing a look of concentration.\nSilence.\nBANG!\nShang unleashed a Fire Blast as he turned around, his sword ready.\nShang's legs parted the grass on the ground, but they weren't touching the earth.\nSHING!\nA black gleam created a half-moon as Shang swung his sword at seemingly an empty place.\nAn instant later, the corpse of a nearly translucent snake fell to the ground in two pieces.\n'And that's five,' Shang thought with a smirk. 'I knew that traveling along the southern part of the northeastern forest would be profitable.'\nYes, Shang was in the southern part of the northeastern forest, which was a risky zone. Beasts from the Wasteland would come here from time to time to have their young.\nFortunately, Shang knew a couple of the beasts from the Wasteland now. After all, teacher Niria had talked about General Stage beasts one could find in the northeastern forest in her last lesson. She hadn't been able to get through all of them, but she had talked about a lot.\nBecause of that, Shang felt confident in hunting in this risky part of the forest.\nFirst of all, the beasts of the Wasteland were mostly very direct predators. There were only a few beasts that hunted via ambushes in the Wasteland.\nThe Wasteland simply didn't have many ways to hide, which meant that there were only very few ambush predators in general there.\nOn top of that, those beasts only came here to have their young. They generally weren't very interested in Soldier Stage beings since they gave nearly no Mana.\nSure, if they saw something like that directly in front of them, they might as well kill it, but if that thing was very good at running away, they wouldn't bother. At most, they would release one or two casual attacks, and if the target managed to survive them and run away, they would simply stop.\nBut surviving two casual attacks from a General Stage beast was still very difficult.\nThat's where Shang's left arm came into play.\nBy now, Shang had become very good at using his left arm to move around.\nAnd it had already proven to be a lifesaver.\nDuring the night, Shang had seen a big pangolin walking through the forest. When Shang had seen it, he had directly known that it was a General Stage beast.\nThe pangolin had noticed Shang on one of the trees, and earthen spears appeared around its body, similar to what the Ice Spear Bear had done.\nBut there were six spears instead of one or two, and they moved with far greater speed.\nThe pangolin had shot them in a spread at Shang.\nMeanwhile, Shang had used his left arm to jump over the crowns of the trees and then used an Ice Blast to shoot into the distance.\nThe earthen spears missed after destroying a couple of trees.\nWhen the pangolin saw that its prey had fled into the distance at such speeds, it gave up.\nSure, the pangolin was very fast, and it could charge forward, destroying all the trees in the process.\nBut that was too much effort just to kill something at the Soldier Stage.\nIt wasn't worth the hassle.\nOf course, this maneuver cost Shang a lot of Mana to regenerate his left arm, but it was worth it.\nAfter all, this ability to quickly flee was precisely how Shang was able to hunt in the southern part of the northeastern forest.\nLuckily, there weren't that many General Stage beasts, and the pangolin had been the only General Stage beast Shang had seen during the night.\nShang pocketed the corpse of the Vanishing Snake he had just killed and ran towards the west.\nHunting in the southern part of the northeastern forest had been worth it!\nShang hadn't seen many Swamp Millipedes, and even the Pest Cats weren't as numerous in this place. After all, the young of the General Stage beasts walked around this place, and they were generally more powerful than Pest Cats.\nBut Vanishing Snakes thrived here.\nThe young of General Stage beasts were great nourishment for Vanishing Snakes, and they loved hunting here.\nAnd that showed once again why the Vanishing Snakes were worth so many Contribution Points. Most progenies of General Stage beasts from the Wasteland were on the blacklist. After all, the Wasteland was the biggest moneymaker for Warrior's Paradise.\nYet, the Vanishing Snakes kept killing these young.\nOn top of that, the fact that the Vanishing Snakes could kill so many young also showed how dangerous the Empress Cobra Zone actually was, and by extension, the Swamp Millipedes.\nIf the Swamp Millipedes managed to expand the swamp towards the Wasteland, the Wasteland might actually stop existing.\nThe Empress Cobra Zone was just very dangerous in general.\nAfter about an hour of traveling, Shang exited the northeastern forest after a profitable night of hunting.\nShang looked towards the east and saw that the sky was a bit brighter than in the middle of the night, but it also wasn't nearly time for dawn.\nHe guessed that it was probably around 4 am.\nShang ran towards the west and reached the street rather quickly. This time, he wasn't near the Farm Line since he had been hunting in the southern part of the northeastern forest.\nOn his way, Shang saw another dog that was interested in the beast sack. He simply let the dog sniff the beast sack for a bit. The dog eventually became bored and left.\nShang reached Warrior's Paradise shortly before sunrise. The big gates were still closed, which meant that Shang had to go through a manual inspection.\n\"Good job killing all these Vanishing Snakes,\" the inspecting guard said with a smile as he closed the beast sack again. \"You're protecting Warrior's Paradise's prosperity and the lives of many young hunters!\"\nShang only smiled politely, something he hadn't done in a long while. \"Thanks,\" he said.\nThe guard nodded and gestured to the smaller door behind him. \"Get on it, rich boy,\" he said with a smile.\nShang nodded and entered the city.\nShang reached the academy rather quickly as the first people started to wake up inside Warrior's Paradise.\n\"Teacher, I want to enter the academy,\" Shang said as he saw teacher Loran sleeping near the closed gate.\nTeacher Loran lifted his head with boredom. \"Just jump over the gate,\" he said. \"I don't want to stand up right now.\"\nShang shrugged and jumped over the gate. The gate wasn't there to stop people from entering, which was also why it was only two meters high. It only symbolized if the academy was open or closed.\nAt the moment, the academy was basically empty. Only a couple of students that lived inside the academy were walking around the empty streets as they began training.\nShang walked towards the Exchange Hall leisurely and reached it shortly before the gates of the academy opened officially.\nWhen Shang entered, he saw an older man packing. Apparently, his shift had just ended.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ However, Shang was a bit surprised to notice that the old man was actually at the Commander Stage.\nThe clerks Shang had seen during the day had all been at the General Stage.\nThe older man noticed Shang and his beast sack. \"Make it quick,\" he grumbled.\nShang put the beast sack on the counter without saying anything.\nThe older man went through the contents at record speeds. Obviously, he was very used to doing this.\n\"Emblem,\" he ordered.\nShang put his emblem on the table, and he quickly got it back after a short burst of light.\nShang looked at the number on the emblem, and he smiled brightly.\n14,760.\n\"Two Middle Rank Two units of Ice Affinity ore, please,\" Shang said.\nThe older man sighed, quickly entered a side room, and came back with two blue pieces of ore.\nShang put the emblem on the table, and the Contribution points went down to 1,260.\nThen, the older man left with astonishing speed before Shang could say anything else. Obviously, he didn't want to work anymore.\n\"Do you need something?\" a young woman asked Shang as she had just arrived in the Exchange Hall.\n\"No, I've got everything I need,\" Shang answered as he looked at the two pieces of Ice ore.\nShang grabbed the ore and left the Exchange Hall.\n'Only Fire ore left.'",

      "content": "Chapter 135 The Other Vice-Dean\n'Only the Fire ore is left. I'm so close!' Shang thought with burning eyes.\nHe was so very close!\n'To keep everything about myself hidden, I need to purchase the Fire ore on the market with gold. I can explain the Light ore I bought with a friend, but no one would want to keep a Fire Affinity hidden. It just wouldn't make sense.'\n'The merchants are not here yet. They will only arrive near noon. Until then, I should find something to do.'\nShang thought about training, but that wouldn't help much. The last time he had tried to combine techniques, he had seen that there was no way to advance further. He needed practical experience and feedback from a teacher to advance in that department.\nShang could train in his Affinity, but he believed that there were better uses for his endeavor.\nSo, Shang took out the schedule for the lessons and checked which lessons would take place soon. He could fit in a lesson.\nThere were only two lessons, which would both start in about half an hour.\nOne of them was a theoretical lesson for future officers, which was something Shang wasn't interested in.\nThe other one was a theoretical lesson for the Anti-Mages, the red uniforms.\nThis piqued Shang's interest.\nShang knew that he would need to fight Mages sooner or later.\nHowever, Shang had only seen a single Mage fight up to now, and that fight had also taken place far away.\n'Well, that seems interesting. I should check it out.'\nAs Shang stood up, he ignored the bloodied face that had appeared in his vision again and left. He didn't have to walk very far since the lesson took place on the third floor of the main building.\nWhen Shang arrived, he noticed that the door was open, and he entered.\nIt was a normal room for lectures. There was nothing special about it.\nShang saw two students with red robes sitting in the middle of the left half of the room.\nThey were not talking with each other.\nShang glanced at them, and as if they had felt Shang's glance, they glanced back.\nFor a short moment, their eyes met.\nAnd then, the two students looked away again with bored expressions.\nShang didn't say anything and simply sat down somewhere in the middle of the right half.\nSilence.\nNo one was speaking.\n'I think they recognized me, but they just didn't care,' Shang thought.\nThe image of the bloodied face returned.\n'But that's understandable. The students that join the Anti-Mage Class are the ones living the most dangerous lives.'\n'They are not looking at other warriors or beasts, but at the overlords of this world, Mages. They are not planning on fighting the weakest class of people, the warriors. They are also not planning on fighting beasts, which are on average more powerful than warriors.'\n'No, they set their eyes on Mages.'\n'I guess the politics inside the school and all the social stuff are not relevant to them.'\n'I wonder, what would it take for a student to decide to walk such a dangerous path? I'm here because I know I have a high chance of eventually reaching the True Path Stage, and at that point, every dangerous human will be a Mage.'\n'My fight with the Mages in this world is already set in stone, but that's not true for them.'\nThat was also when Shang realized that he had only very rarely seen students with red uniforms, and when he saw them, they were just passing by.\n'I guess most of them have a reason to hate Mages.'\nShang continued looking at the front absentmindedly. He was only thinking about random stuff as he waited for the lesson to start.\nIn this moment of silence and inactivity, the bloodied face had returned once again.\nShang ignored it again and again, but it would just return.\nShang kept pushing it again.\n'I am in control.'\n'I am in control.'\n'I am in control.'\nAfter a while, Shang started to push the side of his head with his fingers, a telltale sign of someone being stressed and having a headache.\nShang didn't notice it.\nDid he have a headache?\nHe was so used to pain that he didn't even know.\nHe had no idea if he had one or not.\nIf he were to have a headache, its pain would be so weak that Shang wouldn't even notice.\nThe constant destruction of his left arm and his suicidal training had made him numb to any pain that didn't reach the extreme.\nSlowly over the next minutes, more students came into the hall. Most of them threw a quick glance at Shang, but all of them also quickly looked away in disinterest.\nThey all had the same thought.\n'Another one interested in our class. He won't stay around.'\nThese thoughts were understandable. After all, who would want to willingly fight a Mage?\nThat was essentially suicide.\nBANG!\nShang was taken out of his thoughts as the door to the classroom was shut loudly. He looked around and noticed that there were nine other students in the class, one of them with a black uniform, which represented a future hunter. Apparently, Shang wasn't the only one interested in the Anti-Mage Class.\nThat meant that there were only eight students with red uniforms in this Grade, even fewer than the Caterpillar Class.\nThe person that had shut the door was a rough-looking old man. His face had burns and a couple of cuts, his skin uneven and rough. His hair was wild, long, and silver, and it nearly reached his buttocks.\nWhen Shang saw the teacher, his insides shook.\nPowerful!\nHe felt so powerful!\nShang had difficulties discerning the differences in power between the teachers. After all, they were all many times stronger than him.\nHowever, the power of this person was as clear as day to Shang.\nOn top of that, he didn't wear the typical silver uniform that other teachers wore. Instead, he wore thick red armor. There were several small holes in his armor, and Shang could feel several different types of Mana coming from those holes, including Darkness Mana.\n'Hidden ranged weapons,' Shang realized. 'Every hole can probably shoot out a small needle or something similar.'\nAs Shang heard the teacher's steps, he realized that his footsteps sounded strange.\nIt was like there was machinery inside the soles of his shoes.\nShang felt an unreal amount of Fire Mana coming from the teacher's shoes.\nAs the teacher walked down the stairs at the side of the room, Shang felt like a demon had just passed by him.\nShang could quickly tell the reason for this very special kind of armor.\n'He is fully focused on dealing with Mages. As a warrior, he can't close the gap with only his own ability, which is why he has armed himself to the teeth with many versatile weapons. He can probably also use the Fire Mana in his shoes to shoot himself forward.'\n'The hidden weapons are probably there to interrupt Mages when they try to cast a spell.'\nShang also noticed that eight of the teacher's fingers had Space Rings on them.\nAt that moment, Shang realized three things.\nFirst, this was a Vice-Dean, not a normal teacher. Normal teachers had to wear silver uniforms. Only the Dean and the Vice-Dean, Soran, hadn't worn the silver uniforms. This meant that this teacher was probably also a Vice-Dean.\nSecond, this teacher was the epitome of what it meant to fight Mages. He had many scars from his battles, and his entire being and fighting style revolved around countering Mages. Shang wouldn't even be surprised if this was the greatest specialist in how to deal with Mages in the entire world, excluding other Mages, of course.\nAnd lastly, this teacher was powerful.\nIn fact, Shang was certain that this was the most powerful teacher in the entire school, except for the Dean.\nSoran's power hadn't felt even remotely as powerful as this teacher's.\nThis was an old man that had gone through many, many battles against Mages, and he had managed to stay alive up to now.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ He had been fighting the hegemons of this world for many years, and he was still alive.\nHe had probably reached the absolute peak of what a warrior could reach, except for the Dean.\nThe room was silent as the teacher reached the podium.\n\"Defensive Spells,\" he announced.\nEveryone listened, deep respect in their eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 136 Day Of Chaos\nShang listened to the teacher's words.\nThis was important knowledge!\n\"Standard spells,\" the teacher said in his deep voice as he grabbed a piece of chalk.\nHis arms moved, and in just two seconds, a diagram appeared on the blackboard.\nShang looked with surprise and confusion at the diagram.\nIt was an octagon, but there were many confusing and senseless lines connecting seemingly random spots inside the octagon.\nIn the end, a mess of lines and forms could be seen inside the octagon.\nShang had absolutely no idea what this was supposed to represent. He saw no logic in the diagram.\n\"Mana step,\" the teacher said as he wrote these two words above the diagram. \"As you can see, the V-diagram is in there, symbolizing the access of general Mana. The Lion-Diagram shows a gathering of force. The Z-Diagram shows a transportation of force. The Alpha-Diagram shows the transformation of Mana into physical power. The Side-V shows the release of force.\"\nShang's eyes widened in surprise.\nThe teacher explained the confusing diagram in only a couple of sentences and broke it down into something that made sense to Shang.\nHowever, it was still difficult for Shang to discern how the lines were connected exactly. Where do they begin? Where do they end?\n\"The Mana step is the most common and easiest to learn Element-Neutral Apprentice Rank Spell Mages can learn. It simply gathers Mana and releases it in their feet, allowing them to jump to the side.\"\n\"The Invocation of the spell is also counter-proportional, which is the dangerous thing about this spell.\"\nThe teacher looked at the two students without red uniforms.\n\"That means, the quicker the Mage speaks the Invocation, the stronger the Spell. Of course, it also takes more Mana.\"\n\"If a Mage takes a full second to speak the Invocation, the effect will be minuscule. They essentially spend no Mana and move only a little.\"\n\"The Invocation is…\"\nThen, the teacher made some confusing sounds with his voice.\nShang's mind returned to the time he had met Duke Whirlwind. He had spoken similar words back then.\nShang also remembered that Duke Whirlwind had suddenly appeared in front of Shang after around a second of him fleeing.\n'Had Duke Whirlwind used that Spell back then to catch up to me? Additionally, he has taken nearly a second to cast it, which meant that he was essentially only using the bare minimum of Mana.'\n'Yet, that had been enough to jump nearly a hundred meters!'\n'And even Apprentices can learn that Spell?!'\n\"This Spell allows the Mage to reach speeds one level above themselves compared to warriors of the same level. That means that a Peak Apprentice can reach the speed of an Initial General Stage warrior for an instant,\" the teacher explained.\nShang was reminded of his own ability to shoot himself away with his Ice Blast and Fire Blast.\nMages could do the same thing but without injuring themselves?\nThen, the teacher drew another diagram in just a couple of seconds, and this one had way more lines, which were even more confusing to Shang.\n\"Mana Shield, the second easiest Element-Neutral Apprentice Rank Spell,\" the teacher said.\nThen, the teacher went over all the different patterns inside the diagram, explaining what each of them did.\n\"As you can see, Mana Shield creates a continuous shield of Mana around the Mage. As soon as it is activated, they don't need to focus on it anymore. It will stay active and counter any outside physical force it experiences. The Mage doesn't experience any knockback or backlash during all of this, meaning that their concentration will not be broken.\"\n\"However, it is a double-edged sword. If a hit is too powerful, the Mana Shield might sap all the Mana out of the Mage, making them defenseless.\"\n\"Mana Push,\" the teacher said as he drew another diagram.\nShang's eyes widened as he saw the diagram.\nIt was insanely complex!\nHe could barely discern anything!\nThe teacher had also taken nearly six seconds to draw it with his impressive speed.\nThen, the teacher took nearly three minutes to explain all the different diagrams.\nShang's head was thrown into confusion as he tried to keep up with the explanation.\nSadly, he couldn't. It was just too complex.\n\"Only very talented Apprentices can learn that Spell, and also only in the Late Apprentice Realm or higher. It's very complicated, as you can see.\"\n\"It allows the Apprentice to create a force field around a part of their body, which they can use to redirect enemy attacks. You can essentially view it as a very powerful magnet that pushes your weapon away instead of attracting it.\"\n\"Element-Specific Apprentice Rank Defensive Spells,\" the teacher announced.\n\"Redirecting explosion.\"\nThe next diagram was less complex, but it also inherently looked different somehow. Shang wasn't quite sure why.\nAs Shang listened, the teacher began to list one Spell after another.\nIn the end, it took half the lesson to explain all the different kinds of Defensive Spells.\nAfter that, the teacher talked about the weaknesses of each Spell, ways on how to discern what spell the opponent was casting, most likely next moves, counters, things to avoid, and many other things.\nShang was basically stunned through the entire lesson.\nMages fought so very differently from anything Shang had ever fought.\nHowever, Shang absorbed the knowledge like a sponge. It was presented and explained in a relatively understandable manner, and Shang could hear the epitome of experience inside the teacher's voice.\nHe knew what he was talking about.\nNear the end of the lesson, the teacher talked about something else.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"The Day of Chaos is in two weeks,\" he said. \"I will decide which of you gets the quota based on how you perform in the practical exam next week. As a Vice-Dean, I can bring up to five people, which means that three of you will have to stay home.\"\nObviously, he didn't even think about the people not wearing red uniforms.\n'Day of Chaos?' Shang thought in confusion.\n'What's that?'",

      "content": "Chapter 137 Merchant\nShang wanted to ask what the Day of Chaos was, but for some reason, he felt like he shouldn't ask the teacher.\nThe entire classroom had been dead silent for the last three hours. Not even the students in red uniforms had said anything.\nIt was probably better for Shang not to ask any questions.\nAfter the short announcement, the Vice-Dean left the room, and the other students began to stand up from their chairs.\nShang remained sitting on his chair for a bit longer, but not that much longer. He also left rather quickly.\n'The Day of Chaos, huh?' he thought as he left. 'I should ask a teacher what that is.'\nShang descended the stairs, but instead of returning to his room, he left the building to go to the marketplace. By now, the merchants should be here.\nSure enough, when Shang arrived at the marketplace, he found several merchants. Shang directly went to the first one that seemed like they were selling ore.\n\"Hello, how can I help you?\" the merchant asked with a polite smile.\n\"Middle Rank Two Fire ore,\" Shang said. \"How much per unit?\"\nSHING!\nTwo pieces of red ore appeared on the table. \"As you can see, our ore is of excellent quality. It directly comes from the Volcano Wyrm Zone. The Volcano Wyrm releases a lot of Fire Mana, which makes the ore from that region especially useful for warriors with a Fire Affinity.\"\n\"How much per unit?\" Shang repeated.\n\"450 gold per unit,\" the merchant stated.\nShang's brows furrowed. 'I need two units, which comes to 900 gold. I have a bit more than 200 gold, which means I need around 700 gold to purchase it.'\n\"Where is the Volcano Wyrm Zone?\" Shang asked.\n\"It's two Zones to the north of the Ice Wyvern Zone, but you can only get there by going through the Empress Cobra Zone and three other Zones,\" the merchant explained.\n\"How come?\" Shang asked.\n\"The area to the north of the Ice Wyvern Zone and to the south of the Volcano Wyrm Zone is a beast battlefield,\" the merchant said. \"Humans don't live there since the Ice Wyvern and the Volcano Wyrm have their beasts fight in that zone. Many Commander Stage and even some True Path Stage beasts fight there. The Mana is in chaos, and no merchant dares to travel through that region.\"\n\"Because of that, everyone has to walk around the battlefield to get to the Volcano Wyrm Zone. Traveling through the Empress Cobra Zone is also very difficult, but it's manageable.\"\n\"However, as you can see, the ore from the Volcano Wyrm Zone is of the highest quality.\"\nShang nodded. 'That explains the price. Sure, he is also selling it at a premium, but that's still a Zone that's difficult to get to from here.'\n'Would it be worth it for me to travel there to buy it locally?' Shang thought as he scratched his chin.\n'I guess I would need at least two days to get there and then another two to return. On top of that, I have to find someone that actually sells it at a reasonable price.'\n'I'm only familiar with the Storm Eagle Zone and a bit familiar with the Ice Wyvern Zone. If I want to travel to the Volcano Wyrm Zone, I would have to study it beforehand.'\n'For what? All that work and time investment for what? To save a couple hundred gold?'\n'I can probably earn enough gold to buy the ore here in five days.'\nShang looked at the merchant.\n'Seems like it's better to buy the ore here.'\n\"I'm interested in two units of the Fire ore, but I'm lacking the funds right now,\" Shang said. \"In the next couple of days, I will try to get enough gold to purchase two units.\"\nThe merchant was a bit disappointed, but not that much. \"Not an issue.\"\n\"If I may ask,\" Shang said, \"do you know of a good way for someone like me to earn gold? I'm new here, and I'm only familiar with how to earn Contribution Points.\"\nThe merchant was a bit surprised by the question, but he happily answered it. \"Go to the Hunter's Guild in the north of Warrior's Paradise. You can accept missions for gold there. Usually, you would need to get through a lengthy process of registering as a hunter, but as a member of the Warrior's Academy, you are automatically a member.\"\nThis piqued Shang's interest. \"Thank you. I think I will do just that.\"\n\"I wish you a profitable hunt,\" the merchant said with a smile.\n\"If I may, I have one more question, but it doesn't have anything to do with the ore,\" Shang said.\nThe merchant looked interested but also a bit skeptical. \"Yes?\" he asked.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"What is the Day of Chaos?\" he asked.\nThe merchant furrowed his brows. \"You really must be new here,\" he uttered.\nShang nodded.\n\"The Day of Chaos is a day that happens once every six months,\" the merchant explained. \"Once every six months, the Storm Eagle leaves the Storm Eagle Zone and flies to the north for a day. No one knows what it's doing in the north since that's outside of Duke Whirlwind's duchy, but it always returns one day later.\"\n\"Whenever the Storm Eagle leaves, there's a chance that at least one of the True Path beasts far to the south decide to go hunting in the Canyon or even the Wasteland.\"\n\"Well, hunting might not be the correct term. It's more along the lines of a rampage. The Mages believe that the beasts act out when the Storm Eagle leaves because they have been suppressed for a long while. The Mages think that the True Path beasts enjoy venting their frustrations on the weaker beasts.\"\n\"This has a ripple effect. Many Commander Stage beasts flee from the Canyon and also kill weaker beasts.\"\n\"During the day of Chaos, Commander Stage beasts run rampant in the Wasteland, and General Stage beasts invade the Wild Forest. Of course, Warrior's Paradise also has to endure severe attacks during that period.\"\n\"The Day of Chaos is a day of fear, terror, but also prosperity. It's one of the very few times the True Path beasts enter places not filled with other True Path beasts, making this their most vulnerable time.\"\n\"But that doesn't have much to do with us little people,\" the merchant said with a grin. \"On the Day of Chaos, Warrior's Paradise is closed to everyone. No visitors are allowed, and the ones living here have to leave.\"\n\"All General Stage warriors and Adepts have to defend the Farm Line from the onslaught of beasts coming from the Wasteland. All Commander Stage warriors and Mages have to defend Warrior's Paradise.\"\n\"Us? We only retreat to the Farm Line and hide until the next day arrives.\"\n\"And then, everything returns to normal,\" the merchant explained.\nShang had been listening with rapt attention.\nThe name was very appropriate for the Day of Chaos.\nAs soon as the Storm Eagle left, the entire Storm Eagle Zone would fall into a state of pure chaos.\nBut what did all of that have to do with these quotas the Vice-Dean was talking about?\n\"Thank you for your time,\" Shang said politely.\n\"No problem,\" the merchant said. \"In exchange, please purchase the ore from my shop and not one of the others.\"\nShang nodded. \"Will do.\"\n\"Then there's nothing to thank for,\" the merchant said with a polite smile.\nShang said his goodbyes and left the marketplace.",

      "content": "Chapter 138 Hunting Guild\nShang walked towards the exit of the academy. He wanted to go straight to the Hunter's Guild to earn some gold.\nBut when Shang went past the gate of the academy, he noticed the teacher guarding the gate.\nThere was always a teacher present. During the night, it was teacher Loran, but during the day, there were always different teachers. It probably depended on the schedule for the day.\nThis time, Shang recognized the teacher guarding the gate.\n\"Teacher Mervin,\" Shang greeted respectfully.\nThe older man was standing at the side of the gate like a statue. In comparison to teacher Loran, he seemed to take his job much more seriously.\nTeacher Mervin was one of the three teachers that had supervised Shang's entrance exam. As far as Shang knew, teacher Mervin was responsible for teaching swordsmanship.\nTeacher Mervin looked at Shang, and a small glint of recognition appeared in his eyes.\n\"You've done something you regret,\" teacher Mervin commented.\n\"What do you mean?\" Shang asked calmly.\n\"You are blind to your own emotions,\" he said. \"I have seen many people in similar situations. I know what they look like.\"\n\"And what do they look like?\" Shang asked.\n\"Distracted, stressed, active,\" teacher Mervin answered.\n\"Active?\" Shang asked. The first two made sense, but the third one?\n\"You can't stand to do nothing,\" teacher Mervin said. \"Whenever you find a moment of calm, your memories haunt you. It's impossible for you to calm down.\"\n\"I don't think that's true,\" Shang said.\n\"When was the last time you slept?\" teacher Mervin asked.\nShang's mind went through his memories.\nWhen was the last time he had slept?\nHe hadn't slept since he had arrived at the academy nearly two weeks ago.\nNormal humans needed regular sleep, while Peak Soldier Stage warriors didn't need much sleep.\nHowever, Peak Soldier Stage still needed around ten hours of sleep per week.\nAnd Shang?\nHe hadn't slept in two weeks.\n\"I'm not tired,\" Shang said.\n\"The effects of sleep deprivation have already taken hold,\" teacher Mervin said. \"You are already showing signs of having a headache, but you simply don't notice them due to your abnormal resistance to pain and suffering.\"\n\"You should try going to sleep. Your concentration is lacking in your current state, making fights many times more dangerous.\"\nShang's insides were churning in frustration, but his head told him that teacher Mervin's words were the truth.\nShang didn't want to admit that he needed sleep, but he knew that he needed to sleep.\n\"There's still something I have to do,\" Shang said.\nTeacher Mervin didn't answer as he only looked at Shang with neutral eyes.\nShang took a couple of steps forward.\nBut then, he paused.\n\"Teacher Mervin, what's the teachers' quota for the Day of Chaos? What's the quota for?\" Shang asked.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"I'll tell you if you promise me that you will go to sleep before you're going to do whatever you think you need to do,\" teacher Mervin answered.\nShang looked at teacher Mervin for a bit.\nThen, he turned around and left for the Hunting Guild.\nWhen teacher Mervin saw Shang leave, he released a sigh.\n'He's running from his problems,' he thought. 'Yet, what's the use in doing that? He will have to confront them either way.'\nAs Shang walked towards the Hunting Guild, he had a couple of thoughts of his own.\n'Yes, I need to sleep, but I don't want to sleep right now. I am so close to finally having a powerful weapon. I got my Light ore, my Darkness ore, and my Ice ore. I'm only missing the Fire ore, which should be the easiest and cheapest one.'\n'Just one more hunt.'\n'I can sleep after that.'\nShang arrived in the north of the city rather quickly. He had been here several times since the gates were also at the north, but he hadn't really looked around here.\nShang searched for the Hunting Guild, and he quickly found a very wide building at the side of the main street.\nShang saw several hunters coming in and out of the building, most of them being at the General Stage.\nSome of them were leaving the city to the north, while several others were walking further into the city.\nShang walked into the Hunting Guild.\nWhen he entered, he was a bit surprised.\nThe Hunting Guild looked very different from what he had expected.\nHe had expected some kind of big bar with alcohol and music, but none of that was here.\nInstead, Shang saw several counters with clerks, lots of paper everywhere, a couple of potted plants here and there, white walls, and some chairs for hunters to wait.\nThis definitely didn't feel like a Hunting Guild of some fantasy game or something.\n'It looks like a mixture of a doctor's waiting room and the DMV,' Shang thought. 'At this point, I wouldn't even be surprised if I have to get a number and wait in line.'\nThis looked far more like a public office than some kind of Guild.\nShang looked to the left and saw a young woman standing behind a counter that had the word reception written on it.\nShang couldn't feel any specific kind of Mana coming from the woman, but he could feel a certain density of Mana surrounding her. She was probably an Adept.\n'Well, I guess I should walk over,' Shang thought.\n\"Hello, this is my first time here,\" Shang said. \"Could you please explain to me how everything works here?\"\nThe woman looked up from the papers in front of her and at Shang. She quickly noticed Shang's uniform.\n\"I need your Emblem first,\" she said, extending her hand.\nShang took out his emblem and placed it in her hands.\nThe receptionist spoke two quick words, and several confusing signs appeared on Shang's emblem.\nThe receptionist furrowed her brows as she looked at the confusing signs.\nThen, she looked at Shang with a bit of surprise.\n\"Alright,\" she said, giving Shang his emblem back.\nAfter that, she grabbed one stack of papers and another smaller stack of papers.\n\"Here you go,\" she said, handing the two stacks of paper to Shang. \"These are your available missions for the day. Read through the mission list and tell me which ones you want to accept. Please keep in mind that the missions you accept have to be completed in less than 24 hours. So, please don't choose too many of them.\"\n\"If you have any questions about any specific beasts on the list, you can ask me, but please keep your questions to your mission targets. I'm not a teacher,\" she explained.\nAfter that, she looked away again as she returned to leafing through another stack of papers with furrowed brows.\nShang felt a bit awkward since the receptionist had explained everything at record speed without even giving him an opportunity to answer.\n\"Thanks,\" Shang said absentmindedly.\nShang took the two stacks of papers and walked to one of the chairs at the side. A couple of other hunters were already sitting there as they were looking through several stacks of papers.\nShang sat down and looked at the first stack of papers.\n'Missions for Initial General Stage beasts in the Wild Forest,' Shang read with surprise.\n'I can choose missions to hunt Initial General Stage beasts?'",

      "content": "Chapter 139 Javelin\nShang was surprised that he got access to Initial General Stage beasts. Why would the Hunting Guild give him access to such strong beasts? Shang knew that he couldn't kill a General Stage beast under normal circumstances. After all, in his battle against the Vanishing Snake, Shang had had several advantages.\nIt had basically been a unique opportunity.\nIf Shang had fought a normal General Stage Vanishing Snake, he would have definitely lost. After all, the Vanishing Snake hadn't even attacked Shang with its tail for the first half of the fight, and its attention also hadn't been fully on Shang.\nShang was confident in his power, but he wasn't an idiot. He knew that he had no chance against a General Stage beast.\nAt least, for now.\nWith a more powerful weapon, Shang could imagine fighting a General Stage beast.\nShang looked around and noticed that the receptionist was busy doing something else.\nSo, Shang's eyes wandered to the hunter sitting beside him.\nIt was a man in his twenties, wearing armor made of brown leather. The leather reminded Shang of the Wasteland.\n\"Excuse me,\" Shang said to the hunter.\nThe hunter looked at Shang with a curious expression. \"Yes?\" he asked.\nShang pointed at the words on his stack of papers. \"Do you think the Hunting Guild made a mistake? I don't think I'm powerful enough to kill General Stage beasts.\"\nThe hunter frowned and motioned for Shang to give him the stack of papers.\nShang gave it to him. After all, these missions were public, and everyone basically shared the missions. Shang doubted that he was the only one that had access to over 50 missions.\nThe hunter looked with furrowed brows at the title of the stack of papers and quickly skimmed through the contents.\n\"Have you killed a General Stage beast once before?\" he asked.\n\"Yes, but I was lucky, and I had help,\" Shang said.\nPlop!\nThe hunter threw the stack of papers back to Shang. \"Then that's fine. No one is hunting alone anyways. If you killed one, you killed one.\"\nShang looked with a complex expression at the hunter's nonchalant attitude.\nHow did the Hunting Guild even know that he had killed a General Stage beast?\nAt that moment, the image of teacher Niria shot through Shang's mind.\nWas it her?\n'Anyway, everything seems to be in order,' Shang thought as he looked at the stack of papers.\nShang didn't plan on accepting these missions anyway. After all, he was not planning on dying.\nHowever, he was a bit interested in their contents.\nShang opened the stacks of paper, and the very first page already showed Shang something very familiar.\n\"Kill adult Vanishing Snakes and document their appearance.\"\n\"Reward: 800 gold.\"\n\"Corpse: Forfeit.\"\nShang looked with confusion at the mission.\nThen, he looked at the hunter beside him again. \"What does corpse forfeit mean?\" he asked.\n\"Means you have to deliver the corpse, and you don't get to sell it,\" he answered quickly without looking away from his own stack of papers. \"Of course, the rewards are also higher. Those missions are generally worth it.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Shang quickly said as he looked back at the piece of paper.\n800 gold.\nThat would be enough for his ore.\nShang took a deep breath and went to the next page.\nHe wasn't about to look for his death.\n\"Find clues of the Pest Queen's whereabouts.\"\n\"Reward: 500 gold.\"\nShang looked at the mission with confusion. 'Pest Queen? Does that have something to do with the Pest Cats?'\nShang looked at the hunter beside him but decided against asking.\nHe wouldn't accept that mission anyway.\nShang went to the next page.\n\"Kill adult Swamp Millipedes and document their appearance.\"\n\"Reward: 400 gold.\"\nAt that moment, Shang considered accepting the mission.\nHow powerful would an adult Swamp Millipede be? It couldn't be as dangerous as an adult Vanishing Snake, right?\nBut then, Shang remembered two crucial details.\nFirst of all, the Soldier Stage Swamp Millipedes were only in the Mid Soldier Stage, while Vanishing Snakes were at the Late or Peak Soldier Stage. That was one of the reasons why they felt more dangerous to Shang.\nSecond, Vanishing Snakes were ambush predators while Swamp Millipedes weren't. They definitely weren't the sneaky kind, and it was easy to find them from quite a distance. That probably meant that their direct combat power was probably pretty high.\nSo, in the end, Shang decided against accepting the mission.\nAfter that, Shang put the first stack of papers away. Obviously, these missions were too much for him.\nShang looked at the other stack of papers, and he quickly found more manageable missions.\nKilling Vanishing Snakes.\nKilling Swamp Millipedes.\nKilling Pest Cats.\nAfter that, Shang saw many, many more missions for killing other beasts. Most of them were completely unknown to Shang.\nShang also found some particular missions that didn't involve killing.\nSome of them only wanted Shang to document the whereabouts of certain beasts.\nOthers asked about surveying an entire area and documenting all beasts that passed by him.\nSome other missions wanted Shang to get some samples from soil or certain beasts.\nBut most missions were still about killing beasts.\nAfter several minutes, Shang was done with looking through the stack of papers.\n'The most lucrative mission is killing Vanishing Snakes. Each one is worth 80 gold,' Shang thought with a frown.\n'I would need nine Vanishing Snakes, which would come down to over 24 hours of hunting in dangerous territory. Additionally, I have killed a lot of Vanishing Snakes already. I don't think the Vanishing Snakes are as numerous as Pest Cats.'\n'On top of that, some Vanishing Snakes might decide against attacking me. I'm not sure if my suspicions are correct, but I feel like there have been fewer Vanishing Snakes attacking me the last time compared to how many there should be.'\n'Maybe their instincts tell them that I'm dangerous.'\n'If my suspicions are correct, it might actually take me three days to hunt enough.'\nShang looked through the other missions again.\nHowever, they were not even nearly worth as much as the Vanishing Snakes.\nFor example, a Pest Cat only had a bounty of one gold.\nWas he supposed to hunt 700 Pest Cats?\nSwamp Millipedes were also only worth three gold, which was ridiculously little.\nBy now, Shang had realized that the academy paid way more for these kinds of beasts.\nSure, there were other beasts that had a two-digit bounty of gold, but Shang didn't know much about them.\n'Seems like I have to work for a couple of days,' Shang thought with a sigh.\n\"You killed a General Stage beast once, right?\"\nShang looked to his right at the hunter beside him. He hadn't expected the hunter to initiate conversation.\n\"Yes, I did,\" Shang said.\nThe hunter nodded. \"I can see that you are new here, but I can also see your potential. I saw that you mostly skipped over the General Stage beasts, which is a smart move. It means you know your own limits.\"\nShang wasn't sure why the hunter was complimenting him. \"Thank you?\" he answered in confusion.\n\"How confident are you in fleeing from General Stage beasts?\" the hunter asked.\n\"As long as they don't specifically try to hunt me down, I'm confident in escaping,\" Shang answered as he remembered how he had fled from that one pangolin.\nThe hunter nodded again. \"Been to the southern parts of any of the two forests before?\" he asked.\nShang nodded. \"Yes, that's where I escaped from a pangolin that threw earth spears at me.\"\nThe hunter snorted. \"That's an Artillery Pangolin,\" the hunter said. \"They're very slow, but their ranged abilities can't be underestimated.\"\n'Seems like artillery is a known concept in this world,' Shang thought with surprise.\n\"Anyway, if you managed to escape from one of those, there should be a rather fitting mission for you in that first stack of papers,\" the hunter said. \"Of course, no mission is without its risks.\"\n\"There is one?\" Shang asked in surprise.\nThe man nodded. \"Page 49,\" he said.\nShang grabbed the first stack of papers again and went to that page.\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"Break the beaks of any young Javelins you find and mark their heads.\"\n\"Reward: 250 gold.\"\n\"WARNING: Javelins are on the blacklist! Killing them is strictly prohibited!\"\nShang's eyes widened in surprise.",

      "content": "Chapter 140 Environmental Planning\n\"Javelins?\" Shang asked in confusion as he looked at the hunter beside him.\nThe hunter nodded. \"You might think that Javelins are birds, but they are actually a mixture between birds and land beasts. Imagine a wolf, give it scales, put feathers over the scales, and replace its head with a bird head with a long beak. Their front legs have very noticeable feathers.\"\n\"They are very quick on land, but they can also expand the feathers on their front legs to create makeshift wings. They are a bit clumsy in the air, but if they jump beforehand, their small wings give them a terrifying short-term control for their jump.\"\nShang had a hard time imagining such a beast.\nA wolf with a bird's head and expandable wings?\n\"The Mages think that Javelins have once been birds that transitioned on fighting on land,\" the hunter explained.\n\"Why?\" Shang asked.\n\"The Wasteland is full of Earth and Wind Affinity beasts, and nearly all of them have some kind of ranged attack. Flying beasts often have issues with dealing with such attacks. Sure, they are fast and nimble, but one good hit with a rock, and they hit the ground.\"\nShang nodded a couple of times.\nThis world sure was interesting.\n\"So, why do we have to get their beaks? Are they worth a lot?\" Shang asked.\n\"No,\" the hunter answered. \"The beaks of the young are worthless.\"\n\"Then why do we have a mission to get them? On top of that, the reward is very high for a beast at the Soldier Stage.\"\nThe hunter smirked. \"Investment and pest control,\" he said.\nShang looked with a questioning expression at the hunter.\n\"Javelins are an average General Stage beast when they reach maturity. They're not very powerful but also not very weak.\"\n\"That is if we let them grow naturally.\"\nShang raised an eyebrow.\n\"You see, Javelins have a peculiarity.\"\n\"They are absolutely helpless without their pointy beak. Their entire offensive capabilities revolve around that beak. Sadly, their beaks don't naturally become powerful enough to penetrate heavy armor. Because of that, normal Javelins only hunt other nimble land beasts in the Wasteland,\" the hunter explained.\n\"However, if we break their beaks twice when they are younger, their beak grows back with much more power. By breaking it twice, the Javelin's break will become terrifyingly hard.\"\n\"Of course, naturally, that won't ever happen. After all, when their beaks get broken, they are essentially already dead since they can't put up a fight anymore.\"\nThe hunter leaned back as he put his own stack of papers to the side.\n\"That's where we come into play. We break the beak of the young Javelins twice, and they grow up to become quite a formidable opponent.\"\nThe hunter smirked again.\n\"But not for us.\"\n\"They become a formidable opponent to Earth Affinity beasts that rely completely on defense.\"\n\"You see, armored Earth Affinity beasts are one of the most annoying things in the Wasteland for hunters. These beasts just keep on walking around, attacking everything they see, and hunting them is a gigantic hassle. It's easy to escape from them, but they interfere in the work of basically all hunters.\"\n\"And now, put yourself in the shoes of a quick Javelin with a powerful spear as a weapon. What would you rather hunt, some nimble humans or a slow fat piece of meat?\" the hunter asked.\nA glint of understanding appeared in Shang's eyes.\n\"So, the Javelins deal with all the annoying Earth Affinity beasts?\" Shang asked.\nThe hunter nodded. \"Precisely. In the Wasteland, normal Javelins are a bother, but Javelins with a powerful beak are an asset. Normal Javelins attack us. Powerful Javelins attack armored beasts.\"\npᴀɴdᴀ nᴏveʟ \"The Hunting Guild isn't directly earning money from these beaks, but indirectly. Every powerful Javelin increases the overall experience for us hunters in the Wasteland. It makes our lives that much easier.\"\nShang nodded. \"That makes sense.\"\n\"The young Javelins are only at the southern parts of the forests,\" the hunter added. \"Since there is a high likelihood of encountering General Stage beasts in that area, the mission is in the stack of General Stage beasts.\"\n\"Sadly, not many hunters accept these missions. The reward is too low for General Stage hunters, but the mission is also too dangerous for Soldier Stage hunters. The Hunting Guild just recently upped the reward from 200 gold per Javelin to 250 gold.\"\n\"That sounds great,\" Shang said. \"I think that's just the right mission for me.\"\nThe hunter nodded with a smile. \"That's good. You're making life easier for us General Stage hunters. As a little tip, I would suggest for you to go to the southern part of the northwestern forest. There are far more young Javelins there than in the northeastern forest. You can imagine why.\"\nShang nodded. He knew why.\nThe Vanishing Snakes.\nThey really made trouble for everyone. No wonder they were worth so many Contribution Points.\n\"Anyway, gotta go,\" the hunter said as he stood up. \"My team's waiting for me.\"\n\"Thank you again,\" Shang said.\nThe hunter winked at Shang before he went to the receptionist to register a couple of missions.\nAfter the hunter left the Hunting Guild, Shang stood up and also walked to the receptionist.\n\"This one, please,\" Shang said, pointing at the mission with the Javelins.\nThe receptionist took away the stacks of papers and quickly wrote a couple of things down.\nThen, she put a long, square-like object on the counter.\n\"If you kill a Javelin, that's a 1,000-gold fine,\" she said. \"Only break the beaks that look green and greenish-blue. If you see one with a blue beak, it means it has already been broken twice. You won't get any reward for those.\"\n\"After breaking the beak, stamp the head of the Javelin with the stamp,\" she said as she pointed at the object on the counter. \"Stamping them shouldn't be an issue once their beaks are broken. At that point, they only want to flee and won't fight back anymore.\"\n\"Happy hunting,\" she said with practiced ease before going back to doing her work.\nShang took the stamp with him and left the Hunting Guild.\n'It's impressive how much the Hunting Guild is investing into keeping their hunting grounds fertile,' Shang thought as he jogged to the exit of the city.\n'They really have everything planned out to the smallest detail. I expected something like that on Earth, but not in this world.'\nShang exited the city.\n'I guess, in a way, I'm doing the very thing to the Javelins what they are going to do for me.'\n'Upgrade my weapon.'\n'I break their beaks to upgrade their weapon, and by doing that, I can upgrade my weapon.'\n'Rather ironic, actually.'\nThe bloodied face hadn't returned in quite a while, but Shang didn't notice.\nHe was too preoccupied with thinking about this world.\n'I've never been in the forests during the day, which is also probably why I haven't seen any Javelins before. I wonder what differences there are between night and day in the forests.'\n'Nearly every hunter is hunting during the day, and only very few are hunting during the night. I wonder why that is.'\n'I've also never been to the northwestern forest before. If I recall correctly, there's also one more pest I haven't seen before in the northwestern forest. I think they were called Life Scarabs. Wonder if I will find some of them.'\nShang looked at the sky and noticed that it was only noon.\n'I got half the day left to break three beaks. Maybe I can get more. Too much money is never an issue.'\nEventually, Shang reached the crossroads again.\nThen, he looked at the distant forest towards the northwest.\n'Let's see how this one goes.'",
