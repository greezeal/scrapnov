      "content": "W: After a lot of trying, I finally managed to convince R to do this,like the sea slowly wearing down an almost unbreakable rock. But here we are, doing it our way: I give R the general ideas of what the chapter should include, and then he works his magic. He's really good at two things,writing thousands of words for hours and doing it in English. After that, I make sure everything he wrote fits with the lore.\nR:Please share your honest feedback. If you believe the story deserves just one star, I'd appreciate it if you could explain why, so I can work on improving\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe snow was thick—too thick. It felt as if nature itself wanted to cover this meat grinder in a pristine white mantle, to hide the dead beneath a pure shroud. But there was no way to erase what had happened here. Corpses lay scattered among artillery craters and destroyed vehicles. My breath came out in visible puffs in the frozen air, clearly altered by having survived the massive artillery barrage that had slammed into the trenches...\nI advanced carefully, the worn AK-74 in my hands. It wasn't the ideal weapon, but it was what I could afford without paying generous bribes for American, European, or any weapon that had spent years gathering dust in an armory.\nMy eyes were fixed on one thing… The Russian T-90M tank loomed like a cornered beast, its armor blackened by explosive impacts. The tracks were destroyed, and the engine hissed with an agonizing sound. But it was still dangerous. A wounded monster is still a monster.\n\"Hans, to hell with this! Let's finish them off and get back to the trenches, we're easy targets!\" yelled Yuri from my right, rifle aimed at the tank. Yuri was a broad man, a Ukrainian with a visceral hatred for the Russians, but also an unshakable loyalty to anyone fighting for his country.\n\"Calm down, Yuri,\" I replied in Ukrainian. My German accent was unmistakable, but after months on this front, no one mocked it anymore. \"If we rush, one of those idiots might blow our heads off from the hatch.\"\nWe circled the tank, making sure no one was around it. I knew how the mind of a soldier under pressure worked. If I were inside, wounded and cornered, I'd rather take some enemies with me before going down.\n\"Hans? Are they still in there?\" Mikola called from our cover line.\n\"Probably,\" I said, looking toward the main hatch. \"But not for long.\"\nI struck the hatch with the butt of my rifle, making sure they heard me.\n\"Вылезайте, или мы взорвем вас! (Come out or we'll blow you up!),\" I shouted in Russian.\nFor a moment, there was only silence. Then, a metallic clank.\n\"Yuri, get ready,\" I murmured. Yuri nodded, pulling out a smoke grenade and popping the pin. He threw it precisely through a slit in the tank. A few seconds passed, and dense gray fog began seeping through the openings.\nThe hatch burst open, and a man shot out, coughing and disoriented. Before he could react, I knocked him out with a blow to the face. His body slumped onto the tank, unconscious.\nAnother tried to escape, less successfully. The second figure emerged with a weapon, firing blindly in our direction. I saw it coming, rolled to the side, returned fire in a burst toward where the shots came from, praying I didn't hit the tank's ammunition.\nA dull thud echoed inside—I had taken down one of the crew.\nA third came flying out, lunging at me with a knife. The move was desperate, clumsy. I grabbed his wrist, turned, and shoved him against the tank. The fight was short; within seconds, the knife was in my hands, and he was on the ground, the blade buried in his throat and his eyes open.\nWith the tank secured, we breathed a sigh of relief. We had paid dearly for this victory—long minutes of relentless artillery fire that had my nerves shot—but capturing a T-90M was a godsend. According to my contract, I'd receive a hefty payout if I managed to bring it back behind our lines safely.\n\"We did it, Hans,\" said Yuri, clapping me on the back. \"Command's going to pay us a fortune for this! Maybe they'll even let us rest!\"\n\"Ja, the fortune is mine, since I'm the fucking merc with the contract… but I'll make sure to share it. Drinks are on me,\" I said with a grin.\nYuri smiled, revealing a grin missing three teeth. But just as I started thinking about lowering my head and going home once my contract was over, I heard the sound that always made me shiver—\nA buzz.\n\"DRONE… DRONE!\" shouted Mikola, trying and failing to shoot it down.\nI snapped my head up and saw it rapidly approaching. A drone. My training kicked in instantly.\n\"Get down! Explosive drone!\" I yelled, shoving Yuri into the snow.\nI turned toward the tank, knowing it was the main target. The little device appeared in the sky, a black speck against the snow-white background. It moved fast—too fast. There was no time.\n\"Run, Hans!\" Mikola shouted.\nBut I didn't make it.Google seaʀᴄh NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nI slipped, still on the tank's roof, watching as the drone dove.\n'So this is how it ends,' I thought,watching everything in slow motion as the drone plunged straight into the tank.\nMy last thought wasn't fear—it was rage. I had secured a massive victory, a huge reward was waiting for me. This wasn't fair.\nThe explosion engulfed me in fire, then a bigger explosion. And then, everything went black.\nI didn't know what had happened, but just as I was ready to make peace with God… I mysteriously opened my eyes again.\n'This can't be heaven. Not after everything I've done.'\nEverything was blurry.\nI tried to look around, but I couldn't even turn my neck. My arms and legs wouldn't respond. Nothing would. Just my eyes. And even they weren't much help: everything was a smear, shadows and formless lights.\n\"Don't fuck with me… I survived but ended up paralyzed? I'd rather be dead.\"\nI tried to move—anything, something. But no. I was trapped. I could only blink and stare, like the rest of my body wasn't even mine.\nDesperation set in. Fast. I felt like a wounded animal that couldn't even scream. Until I tried. I opened my mouth and let out a scream for help… or so I thought. What came out was a sharp, short, strange squeal.\nA cry.A fucking baby's cry.\nI froze.Not that I could do much else, of course—I was already completely immobile.But this time it was from fear.\nI tried again. I wanted to say my name, curse, swear, say something.Only more whimpers came out. Whiny, weak, repetitive, annoying sounds.\nAs I kept struggling with my throat and helplessness, I heard footsteps. Someone was coming.\nA female voice came closer. Her tone was gentle, almost affectionate. She was speaking German, yes, but with an accent… off. Old-fashioned. Words I understood and others that didn't sound quite right, like they came from another era.\n\"The little Albrecht… you're hungrier than usual.\"\n'Albrecht? What the hell is that? I'm Hans, damn it, woman!'\nI screamed—or tried to. All that came out was another infant's wail. Louder, more furious, just as useless.\nI fought my body again. Tried moving my arms, legs, head, anything. But something was holding me down. Tight. Like I was wrapped up. Every effort felt like trying to break free from inside a bag.\nThen I felt hands—one on my head, another on my back. I was lifted with humiliating ease, like I weighed nothing.\nThe helplessness was unbearable. I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. I couldn't see clearly. It was like being buried alive.\nAnd then something was pushed into my mouth. Again and again. They forced it in, I spat it out. They pulled it out, shoved it back in. After a while, something warm began to flow. Milk.\nMilk? What the hell…?\nMy empty stomach growled, aching. And without thinking, without choosing to, I started sucking. Instinct took over. A reflex.\nI don't know how long it lasted. I only know the hunger faded. And with that came the worst part—realization.\nEvery time I tried to talk, baby noises came out. They called me by another name. They held me easily. They had put a nipple in my mouth to feed me.\nI was an infant.\nAnd yet I remembered everything. Years of miserable study to get a chemistry degree. The hell of living with my mother and her boyfriends, who only wanted to kick me out. The flooded job market. My five years in the Foreign Legion. And finally, when I finally got a decent mercenary contract in Ukraine… this happens.\n\"Well… looks like your wrappings came loose. We'll have to fix them. Not good for your posture,\" said the woman, her voice sweet, almost sing-song. She clearly cared for me.\nWrappings? What the hell were they using those for? To immobilize me? On a baby?\nThat wasn't just unusual—it was wrong. Deeply wrong. Wrapping up a newborn like that wasn't some cute old custom. It felt archaic, even barbaric.\nI froze again. My heart started to pound. My whole body tensed, even if I couldn't move it.\nNo… this couldn't be happening.\nAll the oddities I'd noticed started falling into place. The way they spoke. The strange German. The words I didn't recognize. The way they acted. The wrappings.\nThen, suddenly, I felt something give. The bindings—or whatever they were—slipped from my limbs. I thought I was imagining it, but no. My arms and legs were starting to respond.\nI stretched them with desperation. Frantic. Like a man who'd been trapped for years. In a way, I had. The sheer relief of feeling my muscles move—even as weak as they were—almost made me cry.\nThe woman bent down again, ready to wrap me back up. But I wasn't going to let her.\nI fought back with everything I had. I kicked, flailed my arms, twisted, pushed her hand away with a clumsy but deliberate effort. It wasn't much, but for a newborn's body, it was a hell of a fight.\nI heard her sigh, mutter something under her breath, clearly frustrated. She tried again, and I resisted even harder. Again. I pushed her away. One more time. I turned my body to the side.\nFinally, she let out a loud breath and left the room in a rush, almost running.\n'Victory…' I thought.\nBut only for a moment.\nSeconds later, I heard more footsteps. Two people now. One lighter and unsure. The other heavier, firmer.\n\"I can't wrap up young Albrecht. I'm afraid I'll hurt him… you know what his father does when a servant injures one of his children,\" the woman said, her voice trembling.\nI felt them coming closer. A coarse, rough hand grabbed my arms with strength. This time there was no gentleness at all.\nI tried resisting again. I struggled, kicked, moved however I could, but the pressure only grew. They were binding me again.\nI screamed. Cried in pure rage. Not like a baby hungry for milk, but like a grown man trapped in the wrong body. But for them, it was just another tantrum.\nThey squeezed me tighter. I could feel my chest being compressed. My stomach twisted. Breathing got harder—and then I vomited.\nEverything stopped.\n\"Quick, we need to clean him up! We can't leave him like that…\" said the woman, flustered.\n\"Shit… give me something to wipe this,\" replied a deep voice, also uneasy.\nThey scrambled around. I heard rushed movements. Hands fumbling with the bindings. Cloth falling to the floor. Quick touches against what seemed like a table.\nThen the door slammed open.\nA loud crash. Silence. And the presence of someone else.\n\"What the hell are you doing to my son, you pair of incompetents?!\" roared a voice heavy with fury and command.\nNo one answered. There was a long, suffocating silence.\nI heard the heavy steps getting closer, metal clinking with each movement. Something warm wiped across my mouth and nose, cleaning me.\n\"My lord…\" the woman's voice came out barely audible, shaken.\n\"I didn't speak to you, woman,\" the man growled. \"And you… I pay you to care for my son, and look what you do, you worthless idiot.\"\nI heard a scream. Sounds of someone choking.\n\"My lord, mercy!\" cried the woman. \"I couldn't put the wrappings on your son. He started crying and moving too much, I couldn't hold him!\"\n\"So that's what happened…\" the man muttered. I heard something heavy fall to the ground, followed by a deep gasp for air.\nThe metallic steps came closer again.\n\"A fighter already… good. Don't bother with the wrappings. He doesn't like them,\" said the commanding voice, much calmer now.\n\"But my lord, it's dangerous…\" the woman began.\n\"I didn't ask you. I gave you an order. You obey, woman. Is that clear?\" he snapped, raising his voice again.\nI didn't hear a reply, but it was obvious she gave one, likely with a nod.\nAfter that, they covered me with a few pieces of cloth, and I heard everyone leave the room.\n'What a fucking insane day.'",

Breathe, consume oxygen, and turn milk into shit, basically.\nThe woman came often to feed me. Occasionally, she tried to put the wrappings on me again, but she had already learned: if I made a loud enough fuss, she'd get nervous, mumble something, and leave the room in a hurry. Probably still scared from the outburst the man—who seemed to be my father—had thrown at her.\nAnd meanwhile, there I was. Just baby consuming oxygen. Shitting myself had become a daily routine.\nI couldn't do anything to stop it. No control over my bowels, bladder, or anything. I just felt it coming—and then it happened. Afterward, I had to endure someone cleaning me up like I was some useless sack of meat. A humiliating experience, three times a day.\nIt took me a while to get used to it. At first, every time it happened, I wished I had died for real.\nMost of the time I was confined to what seemed like a wooden crib. I could feel the bars with my fingers when I managed to stretch them out.\nSeveral days passed—or so I think—until my vision finally began to clear. At first, just less blurry shadows. Then shapes. Eventually, colors. And then I started to really see where the hell I was.\nThe room was large, only meant to house a crib, some furniture, and a fireplace that was frequently lit to keep the place warm. The maid or a man would often come in to throw more firewood into the hearth.\nThe woman who took care of me had stopped talking to me much since the incident with the bindings. Now she kept it minimal: feed me, clean me, leave. She didn't say much, but with what little I observed, I managed to deduce something important:\nMy family had status. Or money. Or even better: both.\nWe had at least two servants. A room of my own. Decent clothes—though uncomfortable. And that woman who cared for me like her life depended on it. Maybe, in all my fucking bad luck, I at least won the social-class lottery.\nI'd been reborn. But this time, it looked like I'd landed in the top one percent. Sounds nice—on paper. Until you realize that even someone with average income in the modern world lives far better than a medieval noble. Cold water, disease, superstition, and shitting yourself were all completely normal. So no, this wasn't exactly a prize—but within the bad, I was in the best position.\nDays passed quickly. I slept a lot, for obvious reasons. Each day I gained more control over this body, and it became much easier to move it at will.\nWith time, I began noticing the patterns of those who entered the room.\nThe servant who fed me came in several times a day. Always nervous. Always looking over her shoulder.\nA rough-looking man, wearing worn leather armor, kept watch over the room. Sometimes he stayed at the door; other times he entered and tossed more firewood on the fire.\nAnd then there was him.\nA large man. Imposing. He came only once a day. He would approach the crib silently. Stand there, staring at me for several minutes. Then cover me with a blanket and leave.\nHe never spoke a word. But sometimes… when our eyes met, he would smile.\nThat was how several days went by. Aside from those three people, no one else entered the room. I was completely isolated.\nFinally, after what felt like several days of repeating the same routine, the large man broke the pattern.\nHe came at the usual time, with the same firm step and stern expression. But this time, he brought something with him: a wooden box.\nWithout a word, he lifted me from the crib with more gentleness than I expected, and sat me on the floor, on a thick blanket. It was the first time I'd been freed from that damned wooden prison. The floor was cold, hard, but I didn't care. It was freedom. Even if only brief.\nHe took out four objects from the box and placed them in front of me, one by one, in an almost ritualistic order\nFirst, a small figurine of a dog. Then, a rattle—simple, but well made.\nNext, a wooden warhammer. Small, but recognizable: thick head, short handle, no decorations. And finally, a carved horse.\nOnce everything was in place, he sat across from me. Silent. Watching me.\nBut this time, it wasn't the same empty silence as before. This time he was expecting something. A decision.\nAnd it didn't take a genius to figure out what kind of answer he was looking for.\nHe came in every day wearing armor. Plate covering his chest. Greaves on one leg only. Red clothing underneath. It was a uniform. Everything about him screamed soldier.\nNow he was looking at me with those firm, calculating eyes, like he could read me.\nHe didn't say it out loud, but the message for me was clear\nWho are you going to be?The loyal dog?The soft child?The warrior?The noble horseman?Googlᴇ search\nWithout thinking too much, I reached for the most obvious choice: the hammer. It was small, but it fit perfectly in my hand. The wood was rough, but solid. As soon as I grabbed it, I looked up at him.\nHe met my gaze.Serious. Reserved. Like something inside him was about to crack. He didn't smile… but he nearly did.\nThen he moved his hand, slowly, and pointed at the box again. He wanted more. A second answer.\nHis intentions were crystal clear—strength alone wasn't enough. He wanted to see what else I could be.\nI looked back at the objects and went with the logical choice: the horse. I grabbed it with my other hand and started moving it, as if playing, trotting. The gesture was clumsy, but clear enough to be understood.\nI looked at him again.\nHe let out a long, deep breath. Closed his eyes for a moment. And when he opened them, I saw an expression I hadn't seen before—relief.... Pride.\n\"Thank you, Sigmar… thank you…\" he murmured, barely audible, but with a wave of emotion that filled the room.\nAnd that's when everything clicked.\nSigmar… SIGMAR.\nNo fucking way.\nA noble invoking Sigmar with that kind of devotion… that could only mean one thing: I was in the Empire. In the goddamn world of Warhammer Fantasy. Even without seeing beyond this room, I knew it for certain.\nOut of all the possible places to reincarnate, this was one of the worst. Then again, at least it wasn't Warhammer 40k. Small consolation, barely avoiding one of the absolute worst fates.\nWhile I tried to process it, I felt the large man's hands wrap around me again. He lifted me with the same care as always and placed me back into the crib, as if I had just done something worthy of respect. For him, I probably had.\nFor me, I was stuck somewhere between shock and terror.\nThe realization hit harder than any explosion I'd experienced in combat. This wasn't just any fantasy world. Here, gods walked unseen. Whispers could twist your mind. Desires could summon horrors. In this place, if you felt too much, something might notice—and once it did, you were screwed.\nAnd here I was. A baby. Defenseless. With a consciousness I couldn't turn off. An adult mind trapped in new, young, uncontrollable flesh. Vulnerable.\nAnd with a mental record that wasn't exactly clean.\nRage. Lots of it. A whole life swallowing anger. I always wanted to climb, to control my own life. Excess. Drinking and violence.\nKhorne, Slaanesh… even Tzeentch, if he focused on how much I schemed or my love for knowledge. I was a damn silver-platter offering for the gods of Chaos.\nThe fear crept in like a disease. I started paying closer attention to everything—the ceiling, the shadows, the sounds behind the walls. I became paranoid. I waited for a whisper only I could hear. A deformed figure in a corner. A dream that didn't belong to me.\nBut nothing came.\nAnd there wasn't anything I could do anyway.\nToo young to make decisions. Too weak to protect myself. Completely at the mercy of those caring for me. And if one of them was already marked, or if there was a crack in this household… I'd go down with them.\nSeveral hours must have passed before I finally calmed down. Nothing happened. No demonic apparitions, no twisted voices in my ear, no signs of corruption. Everything went back to the usual routine: the quiet room, the wooden crib, the same fire fading with the sunset.\nWith time, the initial fear dulled. The paranoia didn't go away, of course, but it became part of the mental background noise. Just another silent alarm ringing in the distance.\nDays kept passing. The sun and moon crossed the window over and over, marking the rhythm of an infant's life that had nothing to do with my previous one. But unlike a normal baby, I didn't need to discover the world from scratch. I didn't have to crawl by instinct or learn how to move my fingers.\nI just needed to wait for the body to reach the minimum threshold for my mind to take over.\nIt didn't take long.\nAfter a few weeks of patience, I regained full control of my limbs. At first, I crawled—clumsy and slow—but with purpose. Then I managed to stand, holding onto the crib bars. My muscles responded. My legs trembled, but I didn't give up.\nThe large man—the one who seemed to be my father—watched me with pride every time he saw me moving. He would smile, just barely, whenever I played with the hammer or the horse he had given me. But it wasn't an empty smile. It was genuine satisfaction at what he was seeing.\nHe watched me closely. He expected things from me.\nIn less than a month, I managed to control my lower body too. No more shitting myself like some damned animal.\nWith a more stable body, I began escaping the crib. At first, I only tried when the maid or the guard weren't present. But soon I learned to slip out quietly, sliding through the bars and dropping carefully onto the blanket. If they heard me, the guard would catch me and put me back in without saying a word.\nThe stone floor, though cold and hard, was far better than the soft mattress in the crib, which felt like it swallowed you if you stayed still too long. Down there, at least I could practice walking. Balancing. Measuring my steps.\nTime passed. I grew.\nI was already walking with some stability, even if I was still clumsy. My gums itched like hell, like something was tearing the flesh from the inside. Teeth were coming in, and it kept me in a bad mood constantly.\nBut what really struck me was the lack of intellectual stimulation.\nNo one tried to teach me how to speak. No one showed me symbols, letters, books. Not a single written word. Was it normal in this time period to wait so long before starting a child's education?\nI just needed to identify how the German I knew diverged from the Reikspiel spoken here. That alone would be enough to begin mastering the language. I only needed to hear more natural conversations. If I managed that, I wouldn't take long to understand it fully—and if I could get my hands on a book, even better.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

All I know is I've watched the sun and moon cross the same window more times than I can count. The weather changed—I went from relying on the fireplace almost constantly to not needing it at all. The cold slowly disappeared, and the air in the room became dryer, lighter. That tells me at least several months have gone by.\nBut beyond that, nothing else has changed much. The routine is still the same: wake up, eat, shit myself—although less often—observe, walk, sleep. Day after day. The maid—the same quiet, nervous woman—started coming less often. They didn't feed me just milk anymore; now there were tasteless thick warm porridges. Bland, but at least something.Googlᴇ search NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nAnd so it continued. Until one day, without warning, things changed. My father—armed as usual, wearing his metal breastplate, greaves on one leg, and red clothes—entered the room, lifted me in his arms, and for the first time, we left. I passed through the door that had kept me locked for so many months.\nThe journey was long, descending what seemed to be a tower—steep stairs, uneven steps built in strange proportions; no one could walk there without watching every foot placement. Along the way I saw dozens of new faces—servants, guards—heads bowed at my father's passing. No one dared look up. Not as many as I expected, but enough to know we were in a place defined by hierarchy.\nFinally, we stepped outside. It wasn't exactly a castle in the usual sense, but a fortified tower—tall, robust, with attached buildings and an exterior stone wall. From where I stood I couldn't see much, but the fresh air hit me like a wave, and for a moment, I simply breathed.\nWe continued and soon reached what looked like a training yard. A dozen or so men-at-arms practiced swordplay. Controlled duels, lunging, blocking each other's cuts without killing. Some wore shields, others partial armor—filling the space with the clang of steel and impacts against shields.\n\"So this is your new offspring, my lord…\" said a man approaching loudly, clad in chainmail and a dusty doublet. He removed his helmet with a sigh, gesturing toward a wagon that had just passed through the fortress gates.\n\"Yes, Rudolf… unlike the others, I have high hopes for this one,\" replied my father without looking at the knight, eyes fixed on the training field. He tracked one soldier's every stroke, every step, every mistake. \"And how did it go this time?\"\n\"You'd have to ask the scout for the full report, but there are issues… Nothing nice, honestly. It strikes me as odd so many beastmen are moving toward the same village. Not their usual behavior. But luckily, we intercepted a group before they did much. They only managed to kill a couple of livestock heads. So you could say it went well… for now. But their presence will likely linger before they move on again.\"\n\"How many were there?\" my father asked sharply, turning as though expecting a number to confirm his worst suspicions.\n\"Many… too many for what's typical in this region. But they stayed in the woods, didn't cross the river. As I said, they didn't accomplish much…\" Rudolf hesitated but was cut off by my father.\n\"One of those ungrateful dogs must have fathered a malformed cub and kept it hidden. You know well such things attract beastmen like flies to carrion. When we go there, we'll have to give those bastards a clear reminder of what happens when the laws are disobeyed.\"\nRudolf nodded silently, his gaze dropping to the ground.\n\"And what about your new wife? Is she well, my lord?\" the knight asked awkwardly, glancing quickly at me.\n\"What would I know?\" my father grunted. \"That damned woman gave birth and ran off with her father. Good riddance. I don't have to hear her anymore asking for dresses, perfumes, Altdorf fabrics. I thought I married her to spoil her. She forgot the only reason I lowered myself to take a commoner was for her dowry. I wouldn't have sullied my bloodline otherwise, but I needed gold for the mine.\"\n\"you managed to get the Emperor's permissions to exploit the mountains?\" asked Rudolf, mixing curiosity with respect.\n\"Yes. It cost me more than it should have. I had to bribe half the nobility to get an audience with Luitpold, then almost emptied my coffers to offer suitable tribute. But I succeeded. Now I hold the mining rights for the entire stretch of the Grey Mountains, from the Wastelands to Eilhart. It's all mine—mine, as long as I pay the Emperor his due, of course.\" My father's voice rang with pride as he gazed toward the mountains just visible in the distance.\n\"And what about… you know, the vampires?\" Rudolf asked, lowering his tone as though he feared even speaking the name.\n\"Bah… stories. Tales to scare children and superstitious peasants. I'm disappointed you believe in them, Rudolf,\" my father snorted. \"Here we deal only with what can be seen, weighed, and exploited. They've already found veins of iron. With Sigmar's blessing, soon we'll discover something more valuable. And that wealth will fill my coffers. When that happens, we'll end this ridiculous dispute with the Von Kesselheims once and for all. Reinsfeld is mine by right.\"\nMy father continued speaking, and I listened closely—not just for the content, but for the rhythm and tone.\nI was beginning to notice patterns in the Reikspiel. Many words were the same as the German I knew; others differed, but were easy to deduce from context and pronunciation—it felt like hearing a blend of archaic dialect and regional variation. If they continued speaking like this every day, it wouldn't be long before I could speak it fluently.\n\"So, what about Heinrich? I see him training here, but... wasn't he serving as squire to…?\" Rudolf began, in a friendly tone, but didn't finish his question. My father's reaction was instant.\n\"That good-for-nothing...\" he spat through clenched teeth. \"He fell asleep reading books and failed his duties as squire. And when he was supposed to accompany his lord into the forest, he refused. Why? Because he was scared. He was scared. Do you realize that?\"\nHe paused, each word dripping with resentment. \"Damn it… you know the humiliation it was for me to get my son serving one of the Count von Haldenfels's heirs. An opportunity like that doesn't come twice. But no… he couldn't be like Wilhelm…\"\nMy father lowered his voice, but not his rage. \"Wilhelm was the perfect heir. Squire of the Reiksguard. Strong. Disciplined. Almost finished with his training. And he had to die so… pitifully. In a tavern in Altdorf, shot dead by some miserable drunks. A stupid brawl. A badly placed stab. And Heinrich…\"\nHe nodded toward the training yard, as if the sight alone disgusted him. \"Heinrich isn't even his shadow. He's a woman in a man's body. Soft. Cowardly. A useless bookworm hiding behind excuses.\"\n\"We can still teach him courage, my lord. It's not too late,\" suggested Rudolf carefully, choosing his words. \"Besides… you shouldn't speak so harshly of your heir. Only two of your eight children remain.\"\n\"Morr claimed their lives because they were born weak. They died of the first fever. There's nothing to be done with fragile offspring,\" father replied, without a trace of pity. Then he looked at me, holding me firmly. \"But I have high hopes for Albrecht.\"He adjusted me in his arms.\n\"Really? … well, he seems healthy,\" said Rudolf politely, watching me.\nCarefully, my father set me down on the floor in front of him. \"Come on, Albrecht… show him why you're my son,\" he said, pride and expectation in his voice.\nSupporting myself with my hands on the cold stone floor, I stood up with minimal effort. My body responded smoothly. I took steady steps toward him, balanced, without faltering. I stopped right in front of his boots and looked up. \"Father,\" I said, my voice clear though slightly thin. I knew I was playing my role, and I did it gladly.\nHis reaction was audible: \"Ha, even better!\" he said, joy in his voice. \"Where'd he learn that? … Probably some talkative servant,\" he added—his tone showing no doubt, only satisfaction.\n\"Impressive… when was he born?\" asked Rudolf, surprised, observing me anew.\n\"During the last Harvesttide,\" father replied, \"He's been astonishing me. This one is a growing warrior. I won't make the mistake I did with Heinrich, letting his mother educate him. But then again, my dear wife lies dead, and this commoner I took to replace her shows no interest in raising the child to age seven. So from now on, he's under my strict care.\"\nHe began walking toward the training field, with Rudolf and me following. \"Before we ride off to deal with that beastmen problem, I want you to bring your son along. Even if he's young, it's best they start getting used to each other now. Tell the other knights too, when they return with taxes. The sooner they learn their place, the better, don't you think?\"\n\"Of course, my lord. That won't be a problem. They'll all be eager for our children to train together… Have you arranged a tutor for him?\" asked Rudolf, his tone genuinely interested.\n\"I spent a year's income on a good tutor from Altdorf for Heinrich, and what did I get? A sissy,\" my father spat, suddenly raising his voice. \"Hold that sword properly and fix your stance—you're an embarrassment!\" he screamed at the young man training alone. My brother—by what I'd just heard— bowed his head in silence\n\"So I've decided to leave him in the hands of a Sigmarite priest,\" father continued, glancing at Rudolf for approval.\n\"Ah… well… I suppose that's a good idea… but…\" Rudolf hesitated, scratching the rim of his helmet still in his hand. \"Weren't they the ones who educated you? And you yourself said… you know… reading and writing were never your strong suits.\"\n\"So what? You can leave him with a chaplain. It's not essential. I'd rather he know how to wield a sword than a pen. It's far safer to kill a bandit with steel than with words,\" replied father, sarcasm in his voice.\nI saw uncertainty flash across Rudolf's face. Maybe he thought, by linking his son with me, he could ensure a proper noble education. But not with this man as father. A man who seems to despise teachers, books, and anything that doesn't involve yelling or wielding something sharp wouldn't allow that.\nFather returned his attention to Heinrich, screaming corrections at every position, every movement, every tiny mistake in how he held the sword—hips, grip, elbows, openings in his guard. Every misstep triggered another barrage of orders, demands, and comparisons. Heinrich staggered, gasped, but said nothing.\nUntil he collapsed.\nHis knees gave out. The sword hit the ground with a hollow thud. He managed to stay upright for a few seconds, then fell to his knees.\nMy father looked at him with disgust, as if he'd seen a pig trying to walk on two legs.\nWithout another word, he scooped me up and turned. Then he walked back into the tower.\nSoon after, I was back in my room.\nMy prison.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

But that didn't happen. Suddenly, more often than I expected, I found myself outside the castle, watching the men-at-arms train.\nIt wasn't just a stroll anymore. It became part of a new routine.\nThey'd seat me on a blanket or a small bench, always under the watch of a servant or guard, and from there I could see the whole training field. Swords, shields, shouted commands, sweat, punishments—it was repetitive, but informative.\nI quickly noticed that the number of men had decreased significantly. Nothing like that first time my father brought me personally. The field felt emptier, the shouts fewer, duels more spaced out.\nAnd soon I learned why.\nFather had disappeared.\nHe left days ago. No goodbye. No explanation. He just went—apparently to deal with the problem of the beastmen that he'd discussed with Rudolf that day. He took many fighters from the fortress with him. Probably to cleanse the forests, patrol villages, or hunt those beasts menacing the peasants.\nWith him went the horses, squires, and banners.\nSilence descended on the fortress.\nBut not for long.\nThis apparent freedom ended soon enough, because the one who would be my teacher finally arrived—the Sigmar priest from the village temple.\nHe didn't fit my expectations of a religious man. I'd pictured long robes, amulets, solemn words, white beard. Yes, he wore a robe and bore the twin-tailed comet symbol… but he also wore chainmail, hardened leather armor, and had a warhammer at his belt.\nI suppose for someone who worships a warrior god, that presentation made more sense than I'd admit.\nThe priest took my hand—firm, but gentle—and with two guards guiding me, he made me walk. He was taking me on my own toward the village along a long beaten dirt road descending from the castle.\nFor the first time, I saw the village up close.\nAnd, well… I can't say I was surprised.\nMost of the buildings were rough-cut wood, with no real windows—just holes likely patched with cloth or boards in winter to hold in the little warmth they had. The place smelled of smoke, mud, and bodies working beyond what a human body should endure.\nOnly a handful of buildings had stone at their base or corners—slightly sturdier houses, probably belonging to wealthier artisans or a local official. I couldn't be sure, but you could tell who lived above the rest.\nWe passed what appeared to be a carpenter's workshop. Adults were busy cutting and assembling wood while several children—not much older than me—carried boards, searched for nails, or helped hold up structures. Clearly, they weren't \"learning\" in a modern sense—they were working.\nA few steps later, I spotted a blacksmith's forge. The hammer's ring against anvil never stopped. Constant, rhythmic, deafening, and the heat was brutal even from several meters away. As we passed, I saw a smith, arms blackened by soot and sweat, barking orders while more children hauled coal, metal, and rough iron pieces—practice materials, presumably.\nFinally, I noticed the only stone building in the village, apart from the fortress.\nThe Sigmar chapel.\nAnd unlike everything around it, no expense had been spared here. Well-cut bricks with firm mortar. Perfectly laid tiles with none loose. Arches with stained-glass windows—simple but catching daylight beautifully.Follow current novels on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nIt contrasted almost absurdly with the rest of the village: splintering wooden homes, thatched roofs, poorly nailed boards. It was like they'd ripped out a piece of city and planted it in the mud.\nThe chapel stood in the center of the village, and directly in front was what really caught the eye:\nA statue of Sigmar.\nThe figure was imposing—light-gray stone, taller than any house in the village. Depicted in classic form: muscular, heavily bearded, brow furrowed in serene wrath.\nHe wore chainmail with plate tassets, a cape that looked wind-blown despite being carved in stone. But what drew the eye was the warhammer he held in both hands—Ghal Maraz. Not raised in attack, but planted firmly on the ground, like judgment incarnate, waiting for judgment to fall.\nThe priest continued guiding me by the hand until we finally entered the chapel.\nAs expected, the interior was fully decorated in homage to his god. Banners bearing the twin-tailed comet hung from pillars, stained glass depicted scenes of battle and miracles, and behind the altar stood another statue of the god—smaller, but equally stern.\nOther children were already there—likely the sons of knights and minor officers under my father's command. Only those who, by blood or position, could earn the \"privilege\" of being educated by a Sigmarite priest.\nPrivilege—that is, to listen to Imperial theology burned into your soul, defining what you must be and what you can never question.\nAnd with that, the sermon began.\nThe priest stepped up to the small stone pulpit. Despite his age, his voice was strong, clear, hardened by years of battle and preaching. He looked at us each with intensity before speaking:\n\"Children of the Empire… children of Sigmar… listen well to what your god expects of you.\"\nHe paused, inhaled, and spoke as though each word was a commandment:\n\"Be strong! For the weak have no place in this world. The weak die—and with them, the Empire perishes.\nBe brave! For fear is no excuse for inaction. Cowardice is the crack through which corruption enters.\nBe loyal! Not only to your father and your land, but to Sigmar who created this civilization. Betrayal is the seed of Chaos.\nAnd destroy evil wherever you find it! Without doubt, without remorse, without wavering in blade or judgment. For evil does not reason. Evil does not negotiate. Evil must be crushed, annihilated, eradicated.\"\nIt went on like that for what felt like an eternity. Words and more words about what Sigmar expected from us: strength, discipline, courage, faith, devotion, purity, obedience, justice, fire, death.\nAll the other children stared fixedly at the priest, as if every word was a revelation. Maybe some understood. Maybe others were too afraid to look away. I simply complied. I nodded. I feigned interest. Inside, I wanted to die from how damn predictable and boring it all was. It felt like reading military propaganda mixed with a poorly edited medieval sermon—dressed up in dramatic, repetitive tones that probably worked on half-literate peasants or proud nobles who dared not ask questions.\nFinally, with a loud fist pounding on the stone pulpit, the priest ended the sermon. The echo rolled through the chapel like a dry thunderclap, marking the end of the punishment.\nBut just when things seemed over...\n\"Here begins your first lesson, children of the Empire. Here—in this place, under the watchful gaze of the god Sigmar—you will witness the story of his most faithful son… Magnus the Pious.\"\nWith that, he took a heavy leather-bound book—well-worn at the edges—and placed it on a low table before us.\n\"It will be my duty to teach you to read the story of this sacred man.\"\nTo my genuine surprise, the priest actually started teaching us to read.\nIt wasn't elaborate. He used the basics: letters, syllables, connectors. We repeated syllables, words, simple phrases—the minimal literacy needed for an Imperial child to read Sigmarite writings without committing accidental heresy.\nThe catch was simple: if you didn't get it right on the first try, tough luck. This priest had no interest in repeating himself. He didn't shout at first—it came later—but he made it clear that anyone who didn't learn quickly would be left behind. And if you failed to read correctly in front of the group, he'd take you through a verbal hell until you could pronounce every word, every title, every sacred name perfectly.\nThe older children did okay—reading slowly, stumbling over phrases but figuring out the text with effort. The younger ones—around two to four years old, barely even a full year old in my case—couldn't even manage a complete sentence. They babbled, stuttered, some couldn't identify letters: a complete mess.\nWhen it was my turn, I expected the same—some public humiliation like the others. But not at all. He was gentler with me. Perhaps because of my age. Perhaps because he expected nothing. He simply pointed to a passage and asked me to say the name \"Magnus\" out loud.\nNormally, I'd have done just that. Comply. Don't stand out. But I had a father to impress. A brother who'd already failed. And a future I'd rather be lord of the castle than the spare.\nSo I chose to do more.\nI took a breath, forced my still-developing throat, and read straight from the text:\n\"I can see in your eyes that you fear this enemy. I can see in your eyes that you wonder how we can fight such terrible monsters. Men of the Empire, I have the answer: We fight them with our steel, we fight them with our courage, but above all we fight them with our faith in Sigmar!\"\nMy phrasing wasn't perfect. A few words stumbled. I struggled with the rhythm. But I didn't stop.\nWhen I finished, I looked at the priest. He looked genuinely pleased. He didn't say anything—just nodded once and moved on.\nAfter that, the children were retrieved one by one by their servant . The knight's children accompanied me back, led by the priest. As we climbed the slope back toward the tower, I took the chance to examine the fortress from outside.\nIt wasn't as large as I imagined from within—but its height and position dominated the village. The stone was gray. The walls bore signs of recent repairs, suggesting not-so-distant conflicts. On the battlements, a few guards strolled listlessly, likely bored by the relative peace.\nFrom then on, visits to the Sigmar chapel became a daily routine.\nEvery day for several hours, the priest returned to teach letters, connectors, simple phrases—and always with the book of Magnus the Pious. We read it over and over, each aloud, while the priest corrected or scolded as needed.\nIt wasn't hard for me.\nHaving mastered French, English, Ukrainian, and Russian in my previous life, this dialectal variation of German—Reikspiel—posed no barrier. It felt familiar, even comfortable. Within weeks, I was reading fluently.\nOccasionally, the priest let me stay longer than the others. He'd sit me alone with the book and step away to write or clean the altar. In his way, I think he believed he was doing me a favor… or he saw me as an exceptionally devoted child. He didn't realize that for me, this was a thousand times more interesting than watching sweaty men swing sticks all day.\nIn time, the priest began teaching me to write. But there was a problem: paper was expensive and scarce. He couldn't give me parchment just for me to ruin with crude scribbles. So he used moments when he himself had to write—likely letters for nobles, the castle, or the religious order—and let me watch closely. He pointed out the strokes, the symbols, how to hold the pen, how to dip it, how not to drip ink.\nI figured all of this would serve me well in the future.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

He brought with him new trophies, more dead beasts, and an air of victory in every step. But I never knew exactly what happened out there. Obviously, no one discussed real matters in my presence.\nI had too many things to do.\nMost of the day I had to spend watching the training of the men-at-arms. They sat me near the field so I would listen to the shouting, the clashing swords, the orders, the footsteps, the insults. All so that, according to them, I would start becoming familiar with the sounds of war.\nThen I had to go to Sigmar's chapel, where the daily lessons continued. They weren't of much use anymore. Since I had completely mastered Reikspiel, the only remotely useful part was observing the writing sessions when the priest drafted letters. Sometimes he spoke aloud while doing it, which allowed me to learn the formal structure of imperial missives—the greetings, the titles, the seals, the tone. The rest was repetition.\nAnd finally, the day ended in a room of the castle where several children my age were gathered. They were the sons of father's knights and of the most distinguished men-at-arms.It was supposed to be a time for \"playing\", of course. But the real purpose was to build loyalty bonds from childhood. To force friendships that would later become alliances or influence networks.\nIt wasn't hard to notice how some fathers who were present as guards made gestures to their children so they would approach me. Sometimes they simply took them by the hand and left them in front of me, with an awkward smile, as if that was enough to forge a connection.\nThe games were the typical ones for small children: wooden pieces, little carved soldiers, toy swords, crude dice. But for me… it was unbearable.Having to pretend I was having fun. Enduring so many loud and clumsy children around me.Acting like this was natural, when it wasn't.It was like having to watch cheap theater every day… and being forced to perform in it.\nThat was the routine for several months.\nTime passed relatively quickly. Maybe because there were more things to do than simply staring at the ceiling of the room. My daily schedule kept revolving around fake education, passive training, and forced social games.\nThe only real interruptions to that monotony were the religious festivals, celebrated every now and then in the village. There weren't many, but when they came, everything stopped.\nBut beyond that, nothing distracted me too much from the usual.\nWeeks became months. And the months passed just the same as always: training that wasn't really training, classes that no longer taught me anything, pretend games with children who could barely form a sentence without drooling.\nAnd so, my fourth birthday arrived—approximately, if what father said about my birth was accurate.\nAs I had already become used to, no one celebrated my birthday.It wasn't strange. In these lands, birthdays weren't something to celebrate, unless you were rich enough to afford a banquet, hire musicians, or hand out bread to the peasants. My father wasn't in a position to spend on that, not now, not with his pockets tight from the heavy investments in the Grey Mountains mines.\nExtraction of ore had already begun in some areas, and every coin went to tools, workers, sentries, protection. Celebrating the birthday of a four-year-old wasn't on the list of priorities.\nBut I did receive a gift.One very different from what any other child would expect. And of course, it was also a test.\nOne of the things our fief produced was warhorses, since apparently there was a herd in some village, and ever since my family took control of Reinsfeld four generations ago, they had been producing good horses sold among the local nobility.\nMy father took me to the training yard and, without saying a word, pointed to the corral. There she was: a young mare, light brown coat, nervous, with twitching ears. You could still tell she had been weaned recently. Small, but strong.\n\"She's yours now,\" he said, without looking at me. \"Your steed. You'll learn to ride her. And more importantly, to care for her.\"He gave me no further explanation.\nFrom that day on, the mare became entirely my responsibility. It wasn't enough to climb on her back. I had to learn how to feed her, clean her, keep her calm, understand when she was nervous and why. A stableboy explained the basics to me, but didn't help much. They saw it as part of my education, a necessary step.Another task.\nI had no intention of climbing on her right away.\nI knew very well that falling off a horse, even a young one, could be more than just a bump. One wrong move and you'd fall badly… and break your neck. Or a rib. I think there are a lot of historical references about important people who died from falling off horses.\nThe mare wasn't trained. She barely tolerated anyone approaching. She wasn't aggressive, but neither was she trusting. She moved her head nervously and stomped the ground with one of her hooves if someone stared at her for too long.\nSo I started the proper way.\nI went to see her every day, before and after my other duties. I brought food—grains of wheat, carrots when I could find them, slices of apple. I stood in front of her without getting too close, left the food on the ground, crouched, and waited. Sometimes she ignored me. Sometimes she looked at me with those dark eyes that say everything without saying anything. But she didn't run.\nWith time, I began talking to her. No nonsense. I told her about what I saw, the absurd classes, the training sessions, what I thought about all this. It didn't matter if she didn't understand the words. The calm tone, the steady rhythm… that she did understand.\nDays went by. Then weeks.\nShe now let me stroke her neck without moving or tensing. Later, she allowed me to touch her back, and eventually her muzzle—though I always did so cautiously at first. I breathed slowly, made no sudden movements, and always kept my voice low. I talked to her while doing it, as if that might soothe her, or at least get her used to my presence.\nWhen she no longer pulled away or turned her head suspiciously, I began brushing her coat. I used the old brushes from the stable, worn from use, but still good enough to remove dust and dirt. Sometimes I did it after training with the other children, before going to the chapel, or at the end of the day, when there was barely any light left in the sky.\nShe no longer looked at me with distrust. She already recognized me each time she saw me approach.\nShe would bring her muzzle closer, slightly shake her head, and remain still while I moved around her. I no longer had to talk to her as much. The bond was already formed.\nFortunately, father didn't pressure me… too much.\nI saw him sometimes from the yard or from one of the high castle windows. Always silently watching. He said nothing, but it was clear he was observing every step, every bit of progress. I suppose seeing how I handled the mare convinced him he didn't need to push me. He knew I'd do it, but at my own pace.\nAnd so, when I felt it was reasonably safe, the time came.\nI put on the saddle they had given me weeks before. It was good quality, though clearly modified for training: no stirrups. A direct order from my father, according to what the stableboy explained to me.\n\"Your lord says that if you don't learn to ride using only your legs, you'll become too dependent on the stirrups. So you'll have to learn without them,\" said the boy as he helped me up.\nThe mare grew restless as soon as she felt the change in weight. She stepped sideways abruptly, tossed her head in discomfort, and for a moment I thought she might lose control. But she already knew me. I spoke to her as I always did, in a low, firm, steady tone. My hands touched her neck right where I knew it calmed her.\nShe settled again. Nothing more was needed.\nThe stableboy took the reins and began guiding her around the yard. A short route, slow, barely a controlled trot.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nI squeezed my legs as tightly as I could. I leaned slightly forward to match the rhythm. The movement was rough, uneven. I had to adjust my balance with every step.\nAnd that's how I spent most of the day.Riding. Squeezing my thighs hard. Correcting my balance with every step. Every minute was exhausting, and although I didn't show it, my legs trembled with every lap we took around the yard.\nFinally, the Sigmarite priest arrived.\nThe stableboy helped me down, and I walked toward him with unsteady steps, my legs trembling as I walked.\nBut before I could leave with him as I did every day, father stepped closer.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, priest of the warrior god. I would like to ask how everything is going with my son's education,\" said my father, with a respectful tone. More than I was used to hearing from him.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, honorable son of the Empire,\" replied the priest, slightly bowing his head. \"Your son displays knowledge far beyond that of his peers. I do not err in saying Sigmar has a great future in store for him. He will not disappoint when the time comes to fight the evil that corrupts these lands. His reading skills have truly amazed me, and I've even taught him to write. This boy has managed to memorize large parts of the Life of Magnus the Pious.\"\nI saw father's chest swell with pride.Standing out had paid off.\n\"Perfect… then I believe it would be ideal for him to stop attending the chapel,\" he said, now with a smile stretching across half his face. \"He should focus on mastering skills that will serve him in the future. Now that he's begun riding, I think it's better for him to practice that instead of continuing to perfect something he's clearly already mastered.\"\nThe priest frowned slightly. \"I would advise against that. Your son has a gift. He could have a great future among the servants of Deus Sigmar, especially considering he is your second son, not your heir. To waste his talent simply to make him a replacement for his brother would be a great mistake. He could have a true destiny in divine service,\" he said with a serious voice.\n\"I take your recommendation into account, priest. But the one who is my heir is not even worthy of carrying my name. All my hopes are in him.\" Father spoke with gravity. \"I don't need another book lover in the family. I believe he already has the skill needed to manage his noble duties in the future. I thank you for your work, priest.\"\nFather paused briefly, then added, \"I'll make sure your chapel receives a generous donation for your time. You've done a great job with him, but now it's time for him to begin preparing his body to serve Sigmar by protecting these lands and eliminating any abomination that dares set foot on them.\"\nThe priest lowered his head slightly, saying nothing more. And with that, the matter was settled.\nThe priest finally withdrew, and father looked at me intently.\n\"Come, Albrecht. To the horse. You see, when I have to send you as a page to another house, you must already have mastered the skill of riding, or you'll disgrace me… like your brother.\" said father, nodding toward the mare.\nI nodded silently and walked toward the corral. The stableboy was already waiting for me, and with his help, I mounted again.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

No more slow walks around the courtyard. As time went by, the trots became faster, the terrain rougher, and it wasn't long before I was required to start galloping.\nAnd to be honest, galloping on a horse without stirrups felt like being trapped in a trench while tons of explosives rained down on you. Every movement was an impact. Every jump from the animal felt like it was tearing the muscles from my legs. I had no choice. I could only endure.\nI had to look like the perfect son and heir.\nMake father finally disinherit Heinrich. And for that, I had to act at the very limit of my capabilities. Every single day. Until the day someone knighted me.\nAnd the worst part was, I had finally found something I wasn't naturally good at: galloping.\nOver the months, the mare and I understood each other better. Trotting became easy. I could keep control, guide her, react smoothly. But when training required me to ride out of the castle and gallop through the nearby fields, everything got harder.\nBalance was a struggle. Sometimes I had to cling desperately with both hands and legs. I didn't want to fall. I couldn't afford to fall.\nNow that I no longer wasted hours in religious studies, I spent most of the day riding without rest. And my body felt it.\nMy legs burned. I had serious abrasions on my thighs from the constant friction with the thick fabric of my trousers.\nI had to master the horse as if it were an extension of my own body.\nDuring that time, almost all my responsibilities revolved around caring for the mare as if she were a sacred treasure. I got up earlier than everyone else just to feed her what she liked best. Carrots. Dried apple bits I saved. I brushed her carefully, combed her mane, and cleaned her coat every day, even when she wasn't dirty.\nI made sure she always had clean water. I took part when it was time to change her horseshoes, holding her leg or calming her with my voice if she got nervous. I made her wear the saddle even when I wasn't riding her, just so her body would get used to the constant weight.\nBut above all, the hardest part was something else: getting her used to noise.\nNot just any noise — the kind you expect in combat.\nThe sound of metal clashing against metal. Men shouting. Harsh cracks like the sound of a shield breaking. The screech of tightening straps. The thunder of boots marching.\nA horse that loses control in battle is a death sentence. Not because of the enemy, but because of the fall. The second of chaos when you go from rider to target on the ground, and worse if your own horse lands on you.\nSo I started training her gradually. The stablehand, who barely spoke, taught me several methods.\nBanging pieces of iron near her legs. Dragging chains across the floor. Having soldiers train just a few meters from her. Sometimes I had them surround her while shouting orders like in a simulated assault, while I held her by the halter and spoke to her so she wouldn't panic.\nThe first few months were disastrous.\nThe mare reacted violently to every training attempt. She reared, spun in circles, kicked the air. She seemed to have zero aptitude for war, and more than once I thought she might never adapt. But I couldn't afford that. If I wanted her to be my war mount, I had to make her one, even if it took three times longer than it would for anyone else.\nSo I kept at it. Day after day, without exception. I started using noise. Subjecting her to sudden movement. And using confusion. Anything that could simulate a battlefield, we recreated it.\nAfter a lot of work, I managed to get her past most of her violent reactions. She no longer kicked or backed away at loud sounds. She held her ground. Still tense, yes, but obedient.\nThe next step was more delicate. And more brutal.\nGetting her used to the presence of dead bodies.\nEspecially other horses.\nA normal horse, when seeing the corpse of one of its own, can panic. Some refuse to move forward. Others lose complete control. It was an instinct that had to be broken. If, in the middle of a charge, my mare stopped out of fear of another animal's corpse, I was as good as dead.\nThe opportunity came when they decided to put down an old horse, one that wasn't even fit for plowing anymore. Its body, like everything else in this land, was going to be used to the last breath.\nFor some reason I didn't fully understand, father was present that day. He watched everything closely.\nA man-at-arms approached the animal with a spear. Without a word, he plunged the blade into its chest. The horse shrieked once, reared up, and then collapsed heavily to the ground, blood spilling out in a slow, hot stream from the wound.\nNearby horses grew restless. Some stepped back. The riders didn't waste time.\nThey dipped their hands into the still-warm blood and rubbed it on their mounts' muzzles.\nIt was part of the training. So they could smell it. Feel it. Get used to blood, since it would be a constant companion.\nFather looked at me directly as I did the same.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on\nI dipped my hand into the dark red pool forming under the fallen body. I firmly rubbed it on my mare's muzzle, which was panting hard. Then I ran it along her neck, streaking her coat with the warm blood. She shook herself, nervous, but didn't back away.\nFather nodded, and we simply returned to the castle, where the next phase of training began. This time the goal was to get her used to contact with other horses — what's expected in close-quarter mounted combat, where every rider crashes, pushes, or presses against another with no room to maneuver. Luckily for me, this part was easy. Apparently, the mare had no issues with the physical proximity of other horses. She didn't react nervously or aggressively. It was the first part of training that didn't turn into a headache.\nStill, even though we had accomplished all this in two years, there was much left to improve. The mare no longer startled easily, accepted contact, tolerated violent sounds, screams, even the smell of blood, but she still lacked the precise reflexes needed for a true war mount. Sometimes she hesitated when given sudden commands. If the terrain was too uneven, she became clumsy. She reacted to shouting, but still couldn't fully distinguish whether it came from me or another rider.\nThey weren't serious mistakes, but in battle, those kinds of failures could cost me my life. So the training never stopped.\nIt was expected that by the age of seven I would travel to the house of another noble, and father was already working on it. He wanted me to serve as a page in the most prestigious house within our reach, which already said a lot. Though we were landed nobles, we were only barons, the lowest rung of nobility, but relatively wealthy compared to others. We sold warhorses, and now we were also exporting iron to the merchants in the city of Schildheim. Even so, I had heard father complain more than once about the debts he still had. The interest rates were high, and the payments constant.\nOne of those training days, well into the afternoon, I was practicing jumps with the mare. My body, especially my legs and abdomen, had changed a lot over the years. It was firm, adapted to the tension of riding without stirrups for hours every day.\nThat's when father interrupted the training.\n\"Albrecht, change your horse's saddle. We have to go to the village. There's an event I need you to see,\" father said, calling to me from the entrance of the yard.\nI obeyed quickly. I got off the mare, removed the saddle, and went to fetch another one. This one had stirrups.\nRiding with stirrups after years without them felt almost insulting. It was like riding a bike with training wheels. The control was so easy I briefly wondered how anyone could ever fall off like this.\nA group of men-at-arms gathered around us. Soon we were making our way down to the village.\nFrom afar I saw a crowd gathered in the center. Something was happening. We pushed through the people and dismounted. Father didn't say a word. He just nodded toward a wooden building near the Sigmarite chapel.\nWe entered and quickly took our places. There was a main chair where father sat, and a smaller one next to it for me. Everything suggested we were about to witness a trial.\nWe waited a few minutes, until two guards brought in two people bound with rope. Soon after, many villagers began to enter. They crowded along the walls, pushed each other, murmured, shouted so many things at once that I couldn't make sense of anything.\n\"Enough! You stand in my presence, mob of degenerates!\" father shouted, his tone so sharp and powerful the entire room fell silent.\nI was so close to him that I had to cover my ear from the force of his voice.\n\"Alright... by blessed Sigmar, why are we here?\" father said, now with a firm but controlled tone.\n\"Peasant Hannes is accused of adultery, my lord,\" said one of the knights present, pointing to the man.\n\"Oh... I see. So all this fuss is because you couldn't control what's between your legs,\" father said sarcastically, crossing one leg as he looked at him.\n\"No... my lord, I swear by blessed Sigmar... that witch seduced me... I couldn't resist... I would never do something like that...\" the accused stammered, sweating, looking everywhere but at father.\nIt was obvious he was lying. He avoided eye contact. His tone cracked with every word. He was clearly nervous, making up his story on the spot.\nFather looked thoughtful for a moment.\n\"Be careful with your words, peasant. Do not invoke the name of Sigmar in vain. Are you sure of what you're saying?\" father asked, his tone dry.\n\"Yes, my lord, I swear,\" the peasant replied, still trembling.\nFather brought a hand to his chin, evaluating the scene.\n\"That woman cursed my fields!\" one of the villagers shouted from the back of the hall.\n\"And she made my hens sick. They stopped laying eggs after she walked past my house!\" shouted another voice.\n\"My son had a fever a week after we saw her at the crossroads!\" shouted a woman, arms crossed and face red.\n\"I saw her burying things next to the well at night, that's not normal!\" exclaimed an old man, pointing a finger.\n\"My dog smelled her and howled for three nights straight!\" added another peasant, banging his staff on the floor.\n\"I saw her praying to the moon! The moon, my lord, as if it were a goddess!\" shouted another, making Sigmar's sign over his chest.\nThe room filled with voices. All pointed at the woman. All spoke of signs, omens, superstitions. It was as if they were just waiting for father to give them permission to light the firewood and tie the ropes.\n\"Call the priest immediately,\" father said without raising his voice.\nOne of the guards left quickly and returned shortly with the priest from the chapel. The cleric walked up to father's chair with a firm stride, and father stood to receive him. They began whispering to each other.\n\"I don't trust that man at all, but the whole village is accusing her of something. Call a witch hunter and let him handle it,\" father said, not taking his eyes off the woman.\n\"Yes, good decision. I'll send a missive at once,\" replied the priest, quickly stepping away.\nOnce the priest had left through the door, father sat back down and spoke with a firm, clear voice, leaving no room for doubt.\n\"Alright. Considering that this concerns something beyond my jurisdiction… the accused…\" father said, pointing at the woman, who was pale, motionless, as if waiting for someone to say her name for her.\n\"Brunhilde, my lord,\" said one of the knights.\n\"…shall be kept in the dungeons until the witch hunter arrives, and then we will proceed accordingly,\" father continued, without a trace of emotion in his voice.\nThen he turned to the peasant, who still had his head lowered.\n\"And as for you… ten lashes for adultery,\" father said, raising a finger.\nOne of the soldiers grabbed the man by the arm and took him away immediately. They did the same with the woman. The rest of the villagers began to leave slowly, murmuring among themselves as they exited the lord's courthouse.\n\"Stupid peasants… having to call a witch hunter…\" father muttered under his breath, then looked at me.\n\"See, my son? This will be your headache someday. Having to listen to the complaints of these idiots… what a waste of time, really… it was obvious,\" father said, but didn't finish his sentence.\n\"He was lying,\" I said, completing it.\n\"Exactly… with time you'll learn to notice that. Peasants are terrible liars. Even a child like you already noticed that fool was making everything up and invoked Sigmar's name in vain,\" father said with a half-smile.\nHe paused, watching as the courthouse door closed.\n\"When the witch hunter arrives… well, if the woman doesn't break under interrogation, we'll have him on a pyre… or we'll have her,\" father said, shrugging as if it made no difference.\nThen he nodded toward the exit, signaling me to follow.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Since he had seen how comfortable I was becoming on horseback, he decided it was time to begin more formal military training. So he gave me a small bow.\nIt wasn't a longbow, nor a curved one, not even a crossbow, which I understand are also common in the Empire. No. This bow was simple, made of ash wood, and though it was a training weapon, it was crafted to my size. The problem was, my size was already considerable. I was taller and broader than boys one or two years older, so the bow was also larger than usual.\nThis time, at least, I had more guidance. Several of the guards posted on the battlements helped me with the basics: how to string the bow, how to care for the string, how to adopt the correct stance. Drawing a toy wasn't the same as firing a projectile with intent to kill. Every step had to be precise.\nThe hardest part was the damn strength required. Drawing that bow with my thin arms and still-developing back was a titanic task. And when I did manage to pull it, the result was a joke. My arrows didn't fly. They stumbled through the air, fell at my feet, or overshot the target completely.\nThe guards said nothing. Not a chuckle. But I could see more than one biting their lip to keep from bursting into laughter. It was obvious: they were laughing on the inside, but they knew if one of them mocked me aloud, father could very well order a whipping for wounding my pride.\nNow I had a new routine. My day was split between horseback training and archery practice. My body ached constantly. Legs, back, shoulders—everything burned, everything felt heavy.\nAnd as if that weren't enough, none of those damned guards had the decency to warn me I needed forearm protection.\nThe first time I released the string carelessly, it snapped hard against my left arm. A sharp, burning strike that left a red welt instantly. I thought it was part of the process. I ignored it. Kept practicing.\nThe second time, it broke the skin. There was blood. A lot of it. And that's when I understood why all serious archers wore a damn bracer. But the guards had said nothing. They stayed silent. Probably thinking that if I was stupid enough not to ask for one, then I deserved the punishment.\nAnd maybe I did. Or maybe it was part of the lesson. This wasn't a world where someone would take your hand and teach you how to avoid pain. Here, pain was part of learning.\nFor several days, my forearm was covered in bruises and cuts. But the lesson stuck. I started wearing a leather bracer. I never made the same mistake again. I trained without rest that whole week, until the news came: the witch hunter had arrived in the village.\nI was curious. I wanted to see how one of these men acted—supposed paladins of Sigmar, tasked with purging corruption with fire and steel. I imagined long sessions, meticulous torture, interrogations that pushed the limit.\nNone of that happened.\nBarely half an hour after his arrival, the woman had confessed everything. She broke almost instantly. Rumors spread fast: that she admitted to cursing crops, making pacts with shadows, sleeping with demons. The peasants, of course, believed it all.\nThat same afternoon, they built the pyre in the village center. Father insisted I attend. He said it was important. That there was a lesson I needed to learn.\nHe himself threw the torch onto the dry wood.\nThe woman, tied to the stake, screamed as soon as the flames reached her feet. Some of the townsfolk prayed. Others laughed. Several children threw stones before the fire grew too high to allow it.\nI just watched. I had seen fire before. I had heard those screams before.\nI remembered the explosion of the armored vehicle in my other life. When the shell split it in two and the crew was trapped inside. I remember the heat. The smell of burning flesh. The screams. Screams no one could stop. Screams that never leave you.\nThe difference was, that time all the soldiers watched in horror… We all thought, \"please, not me.\"\nHere, it was different.\nHere, people celebrated while she screamed. They laughed. They applauded. Some cried… with joy. Her lungs filled with smoke, her flesh cooked—and still, the flames weren't the worst part. The worst part was that everyone there was convinced they were doing the right thing.\nFather simply stood beside me and watched as the whole village celebrated the witch's death.\nWhen we finally started heading back to the castle, father addressed me.\n\"What did we learn today?\" he asked, without even fully turning to look at me.\n\"That the peasantry is stupid, and sometimes we have to sacrifice one of them to calm the rest?\" I replied, phrasing it more as a question than a statement.\nFather let out a small exhale, something between a muted laugh and a scoff.\n\"Yes… and no. This could've amounted to nothing, but when peasants fall into paranoia, when they believe they're in danger… they'll quickly turn on anyone who helps soothe their fear. Even their lord.\"\nHe paused. Then looked at me seriously.\n\"That's why we must keep them content. And afraid. But not of Chaos. Not of witches. The only one they must fear… is us. Because we're the only thing protecting them from themselves.\"\nI nodded, storing his words with the same care I gave all my past lessons. Only this one felt far more real.\nThe witch hunter stayed as a guest in the castle, and I got to observe him while we ate venison delivered by local hunters as tax for using father's hunting grounds.\nThe man looked grim, with ash-colored hair betraying his age, and a face marked by old scars mixed with fresh wounds that hadn't fully healed. His eyes were dull but alert, like someone constantly expecting a betrayal he had already lived through many times.\n\"Baron von Reinsfeld, I heard you recently had to clear your woods of mutant abominations,\" said the witch hunter after shoving a large piece of meat into his mouth and chewing slowly.\n\"That's correct, honorable servant of Sigmar. Beastmen. Further north, across the river, in one of the villages under my protection,\" father replied after wiping his mouth with a linen cloth.\n\"Didn't you find it unusual? I mean… yes, they're common in forests, but not gathering in such numbers in one area,\" the witch hunter said, placing his silver cutlery on the half-finished plate and clasping his hands.\n\"I've fought those abominations since my youth. I know their patterns, and their movement immediately raised my alarm. That's why I reacted so quickly the moment I was informed,\" father answered, growing serious.\n\"And you didn't notice anything strange among the villagers? Anything that might warrant closer watch?\" asked the witch hunter, not breaking eye contact with father.\n\"It's clear that one of those...\" father paused for a moment, lowering his voice slightly, \"…one of my subjects must have had a child born with deformities. And between us, I know that when a child like that is born, its cries attract beastmen. I've seen it more times than I care to admit. It can't be just coincidence.\"\n\"Then they broke the sacred law...\" said the witch hunter, tapping the table sharply with one finger. \"That child should have been sacrificed. And you did nothing?\"\n\"The peasants were uncooperative. They said nothing. I lost men clearing the threat, and by the time I arrived, everything had already happened weeks earlier. I couldn't identify the culprit. I left warnings… and raised their taxes,\" father answered without emotion.\n\"A punishment far too lenient for such a grave crime,\" said the witch hunter firmly.\n\"That was years ago,\" father replied, his tone dry.\n\"I'm far more persuasive in these matters, baron. I know how to deal with those who protect—knowingly or not—the forces that threaten the sons of the Empire,\" said the witch hunter, picking up his knife and fork again without looking away from father.\nFather didn't respond immediately. He simply wiped the meat from his fingers with a linen napkin, glanced at the hunter out of the corner of his eye, then at his wine goblet, which he still hadn't touched.\n\"I don't doubt your skill… nor your reputation. But I am the baron of these lands. I also lack investigative jurisdiction over evil, witchcraft, and heresy. And if I start burning villages every time there's a rumor, I won't have any peasants left to work my mines or men to till the fields… the same fields that feed the forces who purge corruption wherever it appears.\"\n\"The worship of Deus Sigmar does not prioritize how full your granaries are, baron. It demands purity from its servants. Order. Faith. Sometimes, to save a hundred souls… you must sacrifice ten. Or a thousand. Sometimes you must cut, even when the wound seems clean,\" he said, slicing off another piece of meat without averting his gaze.\n\"And sometimes, servant of Sigmar, to keep a hundred in line, one must let a few minor details slide—if peace is to last more than a month,\" father replied, now staring him directly in the eye, firm.Follow current novels on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nThe table fell silent. Only the distant sound of the servants' cutlery, waiting to bring more food, broke the heavy air of the hall.\n\"I'll have one of my men escort you if you wish to conduct a more thorough inspection of the village. But don't raze everything without solid proof. It cost me too much to stabilize this region to lose it over a handful of rumors.\"\nThe witch hunter smiled. It wasn't a kind smile. It was sharp, restrained, dangerous.\n\"Of course, Baron von Reinsfeld. Everything will be done according to Sigmar's precepts. Only the guilty will be purged. The innocent… have nothing to fear. But I'll need more than one man… you know… in case I find something that shouldn't be there.\"\nHe shoved another piece of meat into his mouth, smiling again, chewing slowly. Then he took a sip of wine and resumed cutting, as if nothing had happened.\nThe dinner ended shortly after, and luckily nothing escalated further. The witch hunter left immediately for the north, took a handful of men, and wasted no time departing.\nMeanwhile, father was more irritable than usual. I heard him curse the witch hunter in more ways than I could count. He called him a blind zealot, a scoundrel, an indiscriminate executioner… and other things I wouldn't repeat in front of a priest.\nIt seemed clear he had drawn the worst luck possible: one of the most fanatical witch hunters in the region. From what I heard whispered among the servants, he was a devout member of Sigmar's templars.\nNow I understood why father had hesitated so much before calling one. If the village had indeed hidden a deformed birth—as father suspected—then there was no doubt: many people would burn. Not just the guilty. All who knew. All who stayed silent. All who looked the other way.\nAnd that was the true danger of summoning a witch hunter. If he was too soft, corruption could keep festering in the shadows. But if he was too fanatical, he wouldn't stop until he tore out every root… even if it was a flower. Even if no one was left standing.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

      "content": "I would appreciate it if you could post reviews about what you think of the story so far.\n-------------------------------\nNormality returned quickly once the witch hunter left. Thankfully. Father remained in a foul mood, and I didn't want to become the target of his outbursts. That's what Heinrich was for… or any servant unfortunate enough to forget an order or break something they shouldn't have.\nAs for me, I returned to my usual routine: training with my mare. Day after day. Getting her used to noise, blood, the screams of other horses during mock combat. It was all part of the preparation to make her a future war mount—or at least valuable enough to fetch a good price if I didn't keep her.\nAs for the bow… well, I could say there was progress, although I still had a long way to go. I could only hit the target if it was within thirty meters. That wasn't good enough. A peasant with a crossbow could kill me without breaking a sweat. He only needed to load the bolt, aim, and pull a damn metal trigger.\nAnd let's not even talk about firearms. Like those pistols the witch hunter carried—elegant and deadly, if you managed to hit anything. But that was rare unless the weapon was of exceptional craftsmanship. They were simply designed to hurl a massive chunk of metal. And above all: expensive. Very expensive. Getting a decent one that wouldn't explode in your face was nearly impossible. Father had never cared to update the guards' weapons—arming them with pistols would be outrageously costly. And gunpowder? Scarce, controlled, as expensive as fine jewelry. Besides, the Empire bought all the good stuff for its armies. The rest was junk, made by half-trained gunsmiths, with a higher chance of killing the user than the target.\nStill, the bow remained a noble art. Hunting with a bow was expected of us, the sons of nobility. If I ever joined other lords for a hunt, I had to at least know how to hold a bow without looking like an idiot. The same applied to falconry… though in this region, no one sold hunting birds. At least, none worth the coin.\nThere was always the spear option, but… I might be many things, but stupid isn't one of them. Throwing yourself head-on at a boar or a stag, hoping to pierce it before it gores you or tramples you, was a very refined way of dying young.\nSo, in the last few months I had at home, I poured everything into getting better with the bow. I couldn't afford to fail. Once I was sent off as a page, my free time would vanish. I'd spend my days serving a higher-ranking noble, following orders, watching, learning.\nAnd so, once again, the months slipped by in the haze of training—even when my muscles screamed for rest, even when the string cut into my skin if I slipped even slightly in posture.\nUntil, on one of those days that felt like all the rest, father appeared. I recognized him by the sound of his heavy steps. He stopped by one of the stable posts just as I released an arrow. Luckily, it was a good shot. The projectile flew and landed near the center of the target, almost fifty meters away.\n\"Not bad… you already handle a bow better than your idiot brother,\" father said, crossing his arms and leaning back casually.\nI turned toward him. \"Thank you, father,\" I replied, unsure if he was serious or just mocking Heinrich again.\n\"I need you to do something for me. I must travel to Helmgart. There's a meeting with Margrave Mackensen. Apparently, he's agreed to take you on as a page and squire… if you prove you're worth anything. Your progress has caught his attention, but the details of your duties still need to be negotiated. And that, my son, I have to handle in person.\"\nI said nothing. I looked at him directly. Something in his tone made me think that wasn't all.\n\"Yes, it also means you'll be staying at his house… as a sort of political hostage,\" he added at last, meeting my gaze to see if I understood what that meant.\nI just stared. I didn't reply.\n\"The Margrave has always wanted control over the Grey Mountains. He spends his time sabotaging anyone who might aspire to the title he claims for himself—that of Lord Protector. When I obtained the mining rights, I received several letters from him… all with the same tone: warnings. Threats dressed in courtesy. We have no way to counter him, not with favors, not with alliances… so this is the best we can do. Keep you there. In his house. Close. So you become friends with his sons. And likely end up married off to one of his cousins, aunts, or daughters. Which isn't too bad… as long as I keep my head down and don't do anything he might see as a provocation.\"\nThe way he said it was different. He wasn't angry, exactly—just tired.\n\"No problem, father. I'll saddle my mare and join the tax collector's escort,\" I answered at once, doing my best to make it clear he could count on me.\nFather nodded with a faint grimace of approval. It was clear his mind was on other matters, but he paused just a second longer to add something.\n\"Thank you. You might learn a thing or two from the collector. That old bastard… even I don't know how he manages to determine how much to tax each person. You know how deceitful peasants can be… always crying poverty, yet none of them stop brewing beer or raising pigs.\"\nFather crossed his arms. \"That man smells lies like a bloodhound. He always finds a way to know who's hiding coin under their mattress and who truly doesn't have enough for a crust of bread. Watch how he asks, how he listens, how he responds. You could learn a lot from his methods…\"\nI nodded and did as I was told. I prepared my mare with the proper saddle, dressed in finer clothes to make my status clear within the group, and left with the small escort that accompanied the collector. Behind us, several carts followed.\nThe road was calm, familiar, until we reached the outskirts of the village. There, on a low hill overlooking the fields, stood my family's mill. The collector wasted no time: he dismounted, entered, and immediately asked for the record books.\nI approached silently, and when he saw me craning my neck to peek at what he was reading, he spoke without lifting his eyes from the pages.\n\"Look, young Lord… this is one of the most useful tricks to understand the economy of your lands,\" he said, flipping the pages with practiced rhythm. \"No peasant waits to mill their grain. As soon as they harvest, they bring it here. So if you compare these records to last year's, you get a pretty accurate idea of how much was actually harvested.\"\nHe stopped, pointing to a column.\n\"This year was a good one. Nearly everyone milled more grain than the year before. That means more bread, more barley for beer, more straw for the stables… and, of course, more taxes to collect.\"\nI leaned in a bit closer, studying the numbers and names. There was something fascinating in how those dry figures revealed so much about village life.\n\"And what if they lie? What if they hide part of the grain?\" I asked, genuinely curious.\nThe collector let out a short nasal laugh. It was the first time I saw him smile.\n\"Of course they do. They always do. But you never rely on just one piece of data. Look at the mill… then you check the livestock, the tools, the barrels, the salt sacks. Peasants are clumsy when hiding their fortunes. If things go well for them, they brag without realizing it,\" the collector said.\nHe slammed the book shut, turned, and pointed toward the village square, where carts were starting to line up.Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"Come. What really teaches you isn't in the paper. It's in their faces, in their voices… and in where the sweat starts when you ask the right questions,\" he said, pointing toward the horses.\nWe finally returned to the village, and the collector wasted no time. He dismounted, checked a small leather notebook filled with notes, and headed straight to the first house. He knocked hard until a peasant, covered in dust and with calloused hands, stepped into the doorway.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar… taxes, by order of Baron von Reinsfeld. This year, one-tenth is due,\" the collector announced firmly, without raising his voice in the slightest.\nThe peasant didn't protest. He just nodded with resignation and disappeared into the house. Soon after, he began bringing out sacks of grain, which the guards carried over to a wooden scale set up near the village center.\nIt had been installed specifically for this time of year. Calibrated weights were placed on one side, and the sacks were loaded on the other, one by one.\n\"Everything checks out,\" murmured the collector, making a quick mark in his notebook before moving to the next house.\nFrom my mare's back, I watched as the process repeated itself. Door after door, the village began to wake up with a mix of routine and tension. Peasants came out with sacks of grain, cured hides, aged cheeses, even wood carvings or forged tools—each paying with what they produced.\n\"All good?\" I asked the collector, keeping my eyes on the stream of deliveries.\n\"A hundred kilos of grain, twenty of flour. A noticeable increase from last year. No need to squeeze further,\" he replied, without looking away from his next target.\nAnd so we went, house by house, collecting several tons of grain from the recent harvests.\nUntil we reached one house that turned out to be a bit trickier, as the peasant there gave much less than the average.\nThe collector simply stared at him.\n\"Do you take me for a fool?\" the collector asked.\n\"No…\" was the only reply the peasant managed.\n\"This isn't even half of what you gave last year…\" said the collector, looking at the two sacks of grain that must've weighed barely forty kilos.\n\"I was quite lenient when you tried to dodge the census tax by passing your sons off as daughters… I didn't report you to the baron then. I suggest you pay what you owe… don't make me go in and check everything.\"\nThe peasant grew nervous and gestured for him to enter.\nThe collector entered with two guards and began searching, quickly finding the rest of the harvest. He looked under the only bed in the house and walked around looking for a hidden cellar, but found nothing… until he grabbed one of the soldiers' spears and jabbed it into the ceiling. Immediately, grain began to fall.\n\"Idiot… you think I don't know that old trick? Take him to the dungeon,\" said the collector.\nThe guards rushed the peasant while his wife and children watched in silence. The collector had them bring down the hidden sacks and took what was owed: the tenth part.\nThat was enough for everyone else to reconsider their excuses.\nThere were a few attempts to question why the tax was higher than last year, but the collector only needed to say something like:\n\"Maybe a few lashes will help you reflect on it better.\"\nAnd any resistance vanished.\nTo my surprise, the collector completely ignored the artisans in their workshops. He went straight to the village mayor, who was the one responsible for safeguarding the artisans' contributions. Many of them paid their taxes in advance, and it was the collector who determined whether that amount was fair. If it wasn't, he would charge again, using the previous year's payment as a reference.\nThe one he visited today was the cloth merchant. After about twenty minutes of conversation with the collector, he finally gave in and handed over a hefty sum of silver shillings without another word.\nBy the end of the day, a long caravan of carts loaded to the brim with sacks of grain, flour, and additional goods set off on the return journey. Several heads of livestock were also requisitioned: cows and pigs taken to graze on my family's pastures.\nIt was expected that the rest of the taxes from the other villages under our control would start arriving soon.\nAnd they did. Weeks later, more came in, along with news that the witch hunter had burned several people in one village. Their taxes had been reduced after he discovered that the mayor had fathered a deformed child and forced everyone to keep it a secret. The witch hunter burned everyone involved.\nWhat belonged to the Emperor was carefully set aside, loaded into another cart, and sent under direct escort to Altdorf—since our house paid tribute directly to the Grand Prince of Altdorf.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

      "content": "I would appreciate it if you could post reviews about what you think of the story so far.\n-------------------------------\nTwo weeks passed, and Father returned.\nAnd just as he had promised, as soon as I turned seven, I was sent to serve as a page in the Margrave's lands. A strong escort of men-at-arms accompanied me, of course. No one in their right mind traveled alone on those roads. The forests were crawling with danger: bandits, goblins, orcs, beastmen… and who knows what else. There are more horrors between the trees than most dare imagine.\nLuckily, after three years of training without stirrups, riding was no longer a challenge. I could keep my seat even at full gallop. What I still struggled with was giving precise commands with my legs using the stirrups, as I was only just getting used to them. Still, it was nothing compared to the hell of learning to ride without any support.\nWe had to cross the Schilder River to reach Holthusen. There, as noble custom dictated, we went to the local castle to request hospitality. The nobleman received us with courtesy and offered us a room for the night.\nThe next morning, we set out south, following the road that would lead us to Helmgart, passing first through Eilhart and then Ussingen. There was some debate among the soldiers about whether we should detour through Osburg to rest or press on directly to Helmgart without further stops.\nAfter several days of travel, we finally arrived at Helmgart.\nIt was larger than I had imagined. Surrounded by high stone walls, with towers guarding every approach and soldiers patrolling in every direction, the citadel looked more like a fortress ready to endure a siege than a noble estate. In truth, it was both. Helmgart guarded one of the most important passes between the Empire and Bretonnia, making it strategic for both trade and war.\nAs we approached the main gate, one of the guards stepped forward.\"Identify yourselves. Who comes to the Margrave's city?\" he demanded firmly.\n\"We are sent by Baron von Reinsfeld. His son comes as a page, by prior arrangement with His Lordship, Margrave von Mackensen,\" replied one of the men-at-arms.\nThe guard looked us over, then raised a hand, and one of his men disappeared inside. We waited a few minutes under the gaze of crossbowmen posted atop the walls, until the guard returned with another man in tow. This one wore a red livery with the Margrave's emblem embroidered in gold.\n\"Welcome. You have permission to enter. The young lord shall be taken to the castle to present himself before His Lordship,\" said the newcomer, gesturing for me to follow.\nWe passed through the city's streets. The stone paving was neat but worn, many slabs sunken from the constant passage of heavy carts.\nAnd the smell… it was worse than I had imagined. A stifling mix of fresh horse manure, fermented food scraps, workshop grease, and human urine. Though not so different from our own village, here everything felt amplified. Even the air itself seemed thick.\nBut there was no denying the activity. Plenty of it. I saw merchants packing up their stalls at dusk, some still haggling over final prices, others counting coins under the watchful eyes of their apprentices. Craftsmen hurried to lock their shops, fastening doors and windows with heavy bolts.And everywhere, soldiers.\nThere were more armed men than civilians. The streets were filled with uniformed regiments: pikemen with their long wooden spears, swordsmen in light plate armor, crossbowmen marching in formation.\nI even saw a couple of squads of handgunners, their weapons slung across their chests, wearing a perpetual scowl toward anything not wearing a uniform.\nThe castle —or rather, the fortress of Helmgart— was embedded into the mountain like a nail hammered deep. Taking such a position in battle must've been hell. The ascent was steep and winding, flanked by minor walls, watchtowers, and natural parapets.\nEvery segment of the climb was designed for defense. From every angle, archers, crossbowmen, and gunners could rain down death without respite. Even if the enemy came from Reikland —technically allies— the slope alone would wear down any siege attempt. Not to mention the incursions from the greenskin clans infesting the mountains.\nBut the true heart of its defense lay on the other side.The fortress faced Bretonnia with a colossal wall stretching from one end of the mountain to the other. A line of stone. There was only one entrance, just wide enough for merchants and caravans to pass, guarded with barriers, double gates, battlements bristling with weapons, and watchful guards.\nAfter climbing the steep road to Helmgart Fortress, we finally passed through the final gate under the scrutiny of guards who missed nothing. Once again, they stopped us, asked who we were, and we gave the same answer as always: my name, my father's name, and the purpose of our visit.\nThe rest of my escort could go no further. The guards informed them they were to lodge at a local tavern before preparing to return. I, on the other hand, was to continue alone.\nOne of the Margrave's soldiers took my mare's reins without a word, and another motioned for me to follow. We walked through cold, tall, unadorned stone corridors. The smell of food reached me before the sound of voices. We turned a corner and entered the great hall.\nThere he was. Margrave von Mackensen.\nHe was eating with his family at a long table made of dark wood. To his right sat his wife, stern-faced and tight-jawed. To his left, two sons slightly older than me. Further down, a daughter with a sharp gaze and other family members seated silently. Around them, half a dozen servants moved back and forth with dishes, wine jugs, and warm bread. And beyond them, seated on a long bench, at least five other pages. Boys like me. From other houses. All with their eyes cast downward, all attentive to the Margrave's every move.\nThe soldier escorting me gave a slight bow and left.I bowed to the Margrave, and he wiped his mouth from whatever he had been eating before standing up. I looked him straight in the eyes, and he returned the gaze.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"No doubt you're his son… but… are you sure you're Albrecht?\" said the Margrave as he walked toward me. \"According to your father, you're seven… but you're quite tall for just seven,\" he added, looking me up and down.\n\"I am, Margrave Reinhardt. I'm Albrecht,\" I answered, keeping it brief.\n\"Good… your father made a rather special request. Very different from what other parents usually ask — they want me to watch over their sons. Your father asked me to push you hard,\" said the Margrave with a faintly sarcastic smirk.\n\"Typical of Father,\" I replied with a short nasal laugh.\n\"Let's see if you can live up to it… Tomorrow you'll learn your duties and who you'll be working with. I hope you don't embarrass me,\" said the Margrave before turning back to his seat.\n\"Take him to his quarters,\" he ordered, and one of the guards gestured for me to follow.\nThey took me to a small room with a bed, a chest, and a tiny window through which only the faintest moonlight crept.Compared to my old room, it was claustrophobic. But I no longer lived under Father's roof… I was now just another servant of the Margrave — one of noble blood, yes — but a servant nonetheless.\nI slept as best I could on that rough bed, until loud knocks woke me.\n\"Wake up, you're not at home anymore… You've got duties to fulfill. Put these on and present yourself in the hall — you're helping with the meal,\" said one of the servants, throwing a bundle of clothes at me.\nI obeyed quickly, changed as fast as I could, and went straight to the hall without saying a word.\n\"Here, start placing the cups… the silver ones for the family, the gold one for the Margrave,\" instructed one of the maids as she handed them to me.\nIn that moment, I realized just how ostentatious the Margrave's dining hall was — nothing like the austerity of our family dining room.\nThere were fine fabrics hanging from the walls, tapestries embroidered with hunting scenes, carved columns, dark wood furniture adorned with gold details, likely made from rare woods I had never seen before.\nThey showed me where to place the cups and I followed orders without hesitation. Then they handed me the cutlery, and that's when I truly felt out of place… At home, we used a knife, a fork, and a spoon.\nHere, there were four different types of knives, five kinds of forks, and just as many spoons — all polished like no one had ever used them.I didn't understand why they made life so complicated just to eat.\nI kept obeying. Later, I helped move the trays — all made of gleaming silver — loaded with freshly baked bread, fragrant hams that were hard not to glance at, aromatic cheeses, and jugs of fruit juices and wine.\nOnce everything was served, the Margrave's family entered and sat down… They began to eat and converse among themselves as if we weren't even there.\nOnce the meal had been served, they gave us — the pages — our food. A mix of fresh bread with yesterday's, some ham, and cheeses that didn't compare to the Margrave's. We sat at a wooden table far from the entrance and ate in silence.\nAfter lunch, we had to wait until the family had left to begin the rest of our chores. Our tasks were divided. Some cleared the plates, others stored the leftover food — part would go to the servants, the rest to the animals.\nMe? They handed me a broom.\n\"You. The new one… Sweep the halls. make sure there is no dust left,\" said one of the older servants, pointing at me without much interest.\nI got to work without saying anything. I swept the long stone corridors for hours. When I finished, they came looking for me again.\n\"Stable duty. Change the straw and clean the pens. And be quick,\" said the same servant, tossing me a pitchfork.\nI didn't know if this was normal training or if they were just testing — or humiliating — me, but I chose not to question it. I obeyed in silence and headed for the stables.\nThe smell was brutal. I cleaned all the horse filth, replaced the damp straw, and checked the troughs. When I was done, I found some water and washed up as best I could to avoid smelling like a rotting animal.\nNot long after, now a bit more presentable, I was summoned again.\n\"Get ready. It's time to serve the Margrave's lunch,\" said another page, handing me an apron.\nI helped set the cutlery, trays, and wine. Then, when they had finished eating, we sat down again to the same meal as before — bread, leftover ham, and cheese. We ate without speaking.\nJust when I thought the day was finally over, one of the cooks approached me.\n\"Here. Take this,\" he said, handing me a pouch of coins and a list.\"You're going to the market. Buy everything on this list. And if you're smart, bargain. If you come back short… may Sigmar have mercy on you.\"\nOf all the tasks they had given me, this was by far the hardest. I didn't know the price of anything. I had no experience in negotiation.\nBut if there was one thing I was good at, it was observing. So I did the only thing I could — watch.I observed the townspeople, how much they offered, how they haggled, what expressions the merchants made.\nI asked without shame how much eggs cost, or carrots, onions, potatoes. I went through the entire market, and every time someone gave me a price, I memorized it. I had no choice. My reputation was on the line.\nOnce I thought I had a good idea, I started buying. I didn't go for the cheapest or the most expensive. I ignored those selling junk at low prices. I focused on getting good quality at the best deal.\nI got everything: onions, carrots, lettuce, potatoes, eggs. I filled the baskets they had given me and came back with the heavy bags, my hands numb from the cold and effort.\nI thought I had done a good job.But the moment I crossed the service door, they were waiting for me.\n\"You took too long,\" said one of the cooks, without even looking at me.\nI didn't even get to answer before he struck my hands with a wooden cane.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Just when I thought this shitty day was finally over, the last surprise appeared: I still had to train.\nThe first steps to becoming a knight, they said.So we headed to the fortress training yard. A bunch of men-at-arms, pages, and squires were already gathered there — all of them sweaty, covered in mud, repeating movements like trained beasts. The master-at-arms was already waiting for us.\n\"Alright, same as always. Everyone, find a partner and start with the basics... ah, yes, the young lord from House Reinsfeld... I assume you've never held a sword. Grab a wooden one from over there and start swinging it through the air — get used to the weight,\" the instructor said, barely giving me a glance.\nI picked one of the swords, and it was heavier than I expected. Much heavier.I started mimicking the others, warming up, trying not to make a fool of myself.\nThe instructor came over and began barking corrections — adjusting my stance, how I held it, the angle of the swing.\nApparently, all those years watching men-at-arms beat each other in training hadn't been a waste: I remembered the positions, the steps, even common mistakes.\nI spent nearly an hour without rest, swinging the wooden sword side to side, alternating between one hand, the other, or both.\n\"Reinsfeld, come here,\" the instructor called suddenly, pointing at me.\nI stepped forward, breathless.\n\"Young Joachim, take this opportunity to teach the new page the basics of sword technique,\" said the instructor, looking at one of the Margrave's sons — the eldest.Though he was older, we weren't so different in size.\nJoachim gave me that barely-suppressed smile.\n\"Nothing personal, but we all have to learn somehow,\" he said, raising his wooden sword.\nI just nodded. Took a long breath.\nAs expected, I didn't stand a chance. I could barely block or deflect his blows.His attacks were precise, strong, direct. Every time I managed to parry, I took a hit to the hands, and sometimes one to the face.\nThe sword vibrated like a poorly-handled whip in my aching fingers.\nThe heat of frustration climbed up my neck. Seeing that smug smile in every damn exchange was unbearable.\nAfter another hit to my hand, I decided that was enough.\nThe next time he thrust, I blocked it and slapped his sword away with force.Without thinking, I kicked him — a sharp whip-like strike straight to the thigh.He fell like a sack, losing balance.\nAnd without hesitation, I spun on the same leg and kicked him again — a spinning heel to the face.\nThe impact was sharp. He hit the ground flat on his back, and the yard went silent.\nWhen I saw him start crying, nose bleeding, lip split, I didn't hesitate for a second.\nI threw myself on top of the bastard, ready to keep hitting him until someone stopped me.I barely had time to raise my fist before I felt hands grabbing my clothes and dragging me back.\n\"What the hell was that!? This is fencing, not a tavern brawl or peasant brawl!\" the instructor shouted, eyes wide, gripping me by the collar of my tunic.\n\"What if a sword's no good when we're wearing armor!? Then you use a dagger! You fight on the ground if you have to!\" I shouted back, struggling as my blood boiled.\nThe instructor stared at me, lips tight, like he was fighting the urge to scream something worse. He breathed deep, swallowing the rage.\n\"Get out of here, damn it...\" he muttered through clenched teeth.\nAnd without another word, he struck me three times with his training sword.Once on the ribs, once on the leg, and the last on my back.I doubled over from the pain, nearly falling to my knees, gasping for air.\nThe instructor picked up the Margrave's son from the ground and carried him off without saying another word.Training was over then and there.\nI wished that had been the end of it.\nBut no. I had to go wash up as best I could, quickly, without time to complain.My hands were swollen, my face ached, one eye was throbbing — but I still had to go back to serving dinner.That was the routine.\nSet the cutlery.Bring out the trays.Wait for the Margrave's family to sit before the meal began.\nBut this time, it wasn't as quiet as before.You couldn't ignore the large bruise on the face and split lip of the Margrave's eldest son.\nWhile we ate, the Margrave finally decided to address the elephant in the room.\n\"Joachim, what happened to your face?\" asked the Margrave, locking eyes with his son.\n\"Nothing… I… I fell, Father. That's all,\" Joachim replied nervously.Lying clearly wasn't one of his talents.\n\"Sigismund, is that true?\" the Margrave asked, turning to his younger son.\n\"No…\" the boy answered, lowering his head.\n\"Then what happened?\" he asked, raising his voice slightly.\nThere was a moment of silence.Then, all eyes fell on Sigismund again.\n\"The… the new page… hit him during training,\" the younger one finally said, still not looking up.\nI felt my stomach twist.Only then did the weight of the consequences hit me.\n'Shit… they're going to whip me… if I'm lucky,' I thought, closing my eyes.\n\"Albrecht! Here, immediately!\" thundered the Margrave's voice, shaking the table.\nI stood and walked toward him. He looked at me with a deep frown.\n\"Is it true? You did that to my son?\" he asked, barely moving his head.\n\"Yes, my lord. It was me, during today's training,\" I replied, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\"Joachim! How can you be so useless that a seven-year-old leaves you in that state!? By blessed Sigmar! This is what I get for letting you ride horses instead of doing your damned training. Look at you… a child four years younger than you made you look like this…\" the Margrave exploded in rage, unleashing his fury on his own son.\n\"But… but Father… he kicked me… it wasn't even…\" Joachim tried to defend himself.\n\"But nothing! That makes it worse!\" the margrave shouted, then turned to me. \"Where did you kick him?\"\n\"In the leg. His stance was weak, and I took advantage,\" I said briefly, hoping his fury wouldn't shift in my direction.\n\"See? That's because you neglect your training. I didn't mind you riding around for fun, but if you're going to embarrass yourself in front of the pages… you're forbidden from leaving the castle. From dawn to dusk, you'll train. I don't want this happening again.\"\nThen he looked at me.\n\"And you… well, you didn't come out of it any better,\" he said, noting my bruised hands and swollen face. \"This is training, not a damned death match. Still… I'll admit you exposed how poor my son's form really is. I guess I'll forget about taking him on the next campaign against the orcs…\"\nHe motioned for me to leave.\n\"But father, you promised!\" Joachim protested as I walked back to my seat.\n\"Yes, I did. But I'm not going to bury you when one of those green-skinned bastards breaks through our lines and skewers you with a spear.\"\nI sat down silently and let it all pass. After cleaning up, I finally dragged myself to my room. It had been a shitty day… and worse ones were coming.\nThe next day wasn't any better.\nCutting food. Setting the table. This time I was assigned to stand through the whole meal, ready to refill the family's wine cups. I ate in a rush. Then they sent me to empty the fortress's latrines.\nI nearly vomited from the stench. It was unbearable — a mix of rancid piss, old feces, and something else I couldn't define but was just as revolting. Every shovel load was torture. Sometimes I had to breathe through my mouth and look at the sky just to avoid passing out. But I managed to keep my stomach's contents where they belonged. Barely.\nAt least after that I was allowed a quick wash. Cold water, a bucket, and my own hands. I scrubbed myself hard to get the stench off, but I still felt it clinging to my skin. Still, I got dressed in clean clothes and went back to work.\nThis time, I only had to serve food. Nothing more. I was thankful for that.\nSword training was worse than the day before. The instructor never took his eyes off me. His face serious, still, like he measured every move with the precision of an executioner. Every mistake, every misplaced step — he noted them all with his gaze.\nWhen they made me practice with other pages, I noticed something odd. None of them wanted to get too close. They all seemed more focused on my feet than the sword I held. Even the experienced ones. They were more worried about getting kicked than landing a clean blow. And that made them drop their guard. I wasn't skilled with the wooden sword, not yet. But I could defend myself. At least they weren't knocking me down like the first day.\nThe truth is… I loved seeing that fear in their eyes.\nThey were all around my age, some four to six years older. All of them had been training longer than me. You could see it in their movements, in their confidence. But it was also clear they were used to having someone weaker around, someone they could hit without consequences. Someone like me.\nBut I wasn't a punching bag. And I wasn't going to become one.\nUnlike them, I was far more dangerous without a weapon. Not just because of my fists, but my body. Even though I was the youngest, I was average in height. Strong, broad-shouldered, with the hardened muscles earned from stirrupless training and years of physical labor. My father's genes were obvious. He was a massive man. With some luck, I'd reach his size. And with the years of hand-to-hand combat from the foreign legion already under my belt, that made me — whether they wanted to admit it or not — the most dangerous page here.\nEven so, I ended up wrecked after every training session. My back ached. My arms trembled. My legs barely responded. But I gritted my teeth and endured.\nI've survived worse for a crust of bread. Now I just have to endure this for another nine or ten years. Then I'll be a knight. I'll return to father's castle, sleep in a decent bed, have servants, hunt whenever I feel like it, and eventually… when he kicks the bucket, I'll be baron.\nAnd then, finally, I'll get to live the good life.\n-------------------------ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

      "content": "I would appreciate it if you could post reviews about what you think of the story so far.\n-------------------------------\nIn these past months, I've realized something important: I'm much better at swordsmanship than at archery. There's a key skill in sword combat that I've mastered for years—one that most still don't even understand—and that is: not being afraid of your opponent's weapon.\nAnd of course, I'm not afraid of bullets.\nBecause closing your eyes does nothing against a bullet. You can't dodge it if it's already coming for you. If it's going to kill you, it will—just like that. So why would I fear a long sharp knife shaped like a sword? Or worse yet, a wooden sword. That difference, that switch in my head that no longer freezes in the face of danger, has given me a massive advantage over the other pages.\nThey're still afraid of getting hit. They don't want a blow to the face, they don't want to be humiliated. I've already been through that. So every time I thrust high, aiming straight for their faces, they flinch. Some step back, others drop their guard, others blink at the worst possible moment. Doesn't matter if my strikes are pathetic, slow, or clumsy. Their fear does the rest.\nAnd that, little by little, has allowed me to start dominating.\nI can now beat half the pages I train with without much difficulty. Between those distracted expecting a kick, those who tremble when I raise the sword near their eyes, and those who can't handle the pressure of someone who doesn't give up or back down—I've been taking them down one by one.\nI'm far from the best, but I'm no longer the helpless newcomer who didn't even know how to hold a sword. Now they fear me. And for now, that's enough.\nI had finally adapted to the routine. At least I knew what to expect each day of the week. Once a week: clean the latrine. Three times: the stables. Twice: sweep the fortress halls. Those were the \"special\" chores. The rest of the time, it was the usual: serving meals or acting as cupbearer for the margrave's family.\nBeing a cupbearer was considered a \"privilege,\" but only on paper. Because every time I had to stand beside the table, Joachim, the eldest son, wouldn't stop glaring at me with hatred. And if he could give me more work, he did it without hesitation. Commanding, loading, repeating tasks—any excuse was good to try to wear me down or humiliate me.\nGoing to the market to buy things was more random, but whenever I got that task, I made the most of it. I already knew most of the trustworthy merchants. I'd learned to haggle, to point out flaws, to watch how the locals got their prices lowered. I picked it up fast. Every coin I managed to save on those errands, I hid. I found a loose brick in one of the market buildings, loosened it more, and started using it as a stash. That's where I hid the extra coins. When the margrave's leftovers were too few—or just trash—I used my secret fund to buy decent food: dried meat, crusty bread, some broth with real flavor.\nThough of course, you had to know how to choose.\nOne time I got overconfident and spent almost all I had saved on a soup from a fancy stall. It looked luxurious, full of spices, with a rich aroma that made your stomach growl. But something was wrong. Not even two hours had passed before my gut twisted like a wounded snake. I spent the rest of the day locked in the latrines, cursing every damn coin I had dropped on that damn soup. And of course, as if fate were mocking me, I had to clean the latrine afterward.\nFor a moment, sweating from the pain, I considered stealing. Just once. A quick sleight of hand in the chaos of the market—no one would notice. The temptation was strong. But so was the memory of how justice worked in the Empire. Even being a noble, even being the margrave's page... I wasn't stupid. They could break my fingers—or worse—if I got caught. I chose to stay honest. Not out of virtue. Out of common sense.\nThe only days one could truly rest were when the margrave went off to campaign. Sometimes he'd leave because the forests were overflowing with beasts, orcs, or goblins. Other times, because bandits on the road to Bretonnia were disrupting trade. On those days, we only prepared food for those staying behind, and everything was more relaxed.\nThere was also a break when the margrave left for some party in Altdorf and took his family with him. A whole week without having to endure his fat ass or Joachim's whining. We had free time, though there wasn't much we could do with it. We weren't allowed to leave the fortress except for errands, so all that was left was to train, eat, sleep, and repeat.\nI spent my days bruising my fingers with the wooden sword. Over and over. Nothing else.\n\"Albrecht… Albrecht… wake up,\" someone said, shaking me by the shoulder.\n\"What…?\" I mumbled without opening my eyes. I was sunbathing in a hidden corner of the garden, where warm rays passed through the stone wall.\n\"Margrave Reinhardt is looking for all of us. He wants to go hunting. And this time it's going to be a long one, so he wants all the pages to come along,\" said one of the pages, from a noble house in Ussingen.\nI opened my eyes, sighed, and stood up.\n\"But… if the margrave was at a party in Altdorf, shouldn't he be coming back… next week or something?\" I asked, mentally going over the calendar we had pinned up next to the kitchen.\n\"For some reason he came back early… and now he wants us to get everything ready for a long hunt. So we better get moving, there's a lot to pack and not much time,\" said the page, already walking quickly toward the main courtyard.\n\"And what exactly are we supposed to do? Be living decorations, standing beside the tents like human banners?\" I said as I stretched, still stiff from the morning's training.\n\"I don't know… they just said be useful or hide well,\" answered the page, then disappeared around the corridor.\n\"What a load of crap…\" I muttered as I stepped outside the fortress, fastening my leather belt.\nOutside, the activity was frantic. A large entourage was preparing: servants running, soldiers checking weapons, cooks loading provisions, stablehands holding horses. The air was full of dust and shouted orders. A mountain of gear was being piled up: spears, crossbows, bows, nets, cages… I even saw a few bear traps.\nI immediately began to help, loading cargo onto wagons and securing crates. If anyone saw me idle, I'd be given double the work. I already knew that game.\nWhen everything was finally ready, I mounted my horse, who now recognized me well, and joined the retinue heading toward the family's hunting grounds. We formed a long column of squires, guards, pages, hunters, nobles, and loaded carriages.\nWe passed through Osburg without stopping and entered the dense woods. The trees rose like black columns above us. Some guards started talking about how beastmen still roamed these areas, or wolves far too large.\nEventually, after several hours, we reached a deep clearing in the forest. Some tents were already set up—I assumed others had arrived earlier to prepare the ground.\nWithout wasting time, I set up the tent I'd be sharing with other pages. It wasn't comfortable, but compared to sleeping in the open, it was a luxury. With the help of two others, we finished quickly.\nWith that done, I took a few moments to look around, curious about the margrave's guests. It was one of the few chances I had to see other nobles and their strange companions.\nThat's when I saw him.\nIt was impossible not to notice him: a man shorter than me, but with a torso like an iron barrel. He had a reddish beard, braided and adorned with copper pieces that gleamed in the evening light. A dwarf, without a doubt.\nHe was arranging weapons on a campaign table. Short pistols, arquebuses, black powder flasks, daggers, hammers. Everything meticulously arranged. The table groaned under the weight.The source of thɪs content is\n\"Albrecht… I assume you've finished your tasks if you're already standing idle,\" said the margrave, appearing behind me with that voice you could never quite tell if it was a joke or a warning.\n\"Of course, milord. I completed my duties as instructed,\" I replied instantly.\nThe margrave's attention turned to the table. His firm steps approached the arsenal, and he stopped beside the dwarf, silently inspecting the weapons.\n\"So this is what you brought me this time, dwarf. I suppose it's something much better than last time,\" said the margrave, his gaze sweeping over the crowded table.\n\"Ah, milord manling, about time you showed up. The best my forge can produce, as always,\" the dwarf replied, running his thick hands over the weapons like he was blessing his metal children.\nThe margrave turned to me and raised one of the pistols.\"I assume you've seen something like this before… only these are unmatched in quality. Only dwarfs can produce a piece so exquisite, worthy of my grand hunt,\" he said,\nThe dwarf crossed his arms and looked up at the margrave with an air of pride.\n\"Certainly,\" I said, examining the pistol under the light filtering through the branches. \"The finish is flawless… I assume it was hand-worked, since there are no casting lines,\" I added, watching the pistol in the margrave's hands.\nThe margrave raised an eyebrow.\n\"And what do you know about firearms, Albrecht? They're expensive… I doubt your father ever bought one. He's always preferred his faithful greatsword,\" said the margrave.\n\"I've always wanted one,\" I replied, still focused on the weapon. \"But as they say, they're expensive. And black powder is hard to come by,\" I said, turning to look at the arquebus.\nThe margrave let out a low chuckle.\n\"Oh, is that so… then tell me what you see,\" he said, handing me the pistol with a sarcastic gesture.\nThe dwarf frowned immediately. He grunted like someone being asked to hand over their firstborn.\nI took the pistol carefully, feeling its balanced weight. I turned it respectfully, studying every detail.\n\"Rifled barrel…\" I said, gently running a finger inside the muzzle. \"The spiral grooves inside… they make the bullet spin when fired, giving it better accuracy, like an arrow. A difficult and time-consuming job if done by hand—everything suggests it was.\"\nI looked at the dwarf. He no longer frowned. He was watching me with interest.\n\"The trigger is light, with almost no resistance. That means the internal mechanism is polished and well-assembled. The flintlock reacts nearly instantly, so the internal clockwork must be refined. No loose parts. Every piece forged and fitted by hand. Even the stock… black wood… I don't know what kind, but probably oiled with tallow and beeswax. A weapon made to last generations.\"\nThe margrave raised both eyebrows. The dwarf let out a soft grunt, like someone trying to hide how much they appreciated a compliment.\n\"Huh… didn't expect that… how come—\" murmured the margrave.\n\"Nor did I,\" added the dwarf, now looking at me with a bit more respect. \"Few manlings can recognize a good weapon when they hold one. Fewer still when they're just a human pup.\"\n\"Albrecht, go… help with the food… you're wasting time here,\" said the margrave, taking the pistol from my hands.\n\"As you command, milord,\" I replied, stepping away.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I tossed them one by one into the pot of boiling water, which hissed and steamed like an old boiler.\n\"Like all of us, Albrecht… if we're not here to hunt, we have to make sure everything's ready,\" said one of the servants, eyes still fixed on the ham he was slicing into perfect rounds.\n\"I'm done here… anything else I need to do?\" I asked, setting down the knife and stretching my fingers, stiff from the task.\n\"No… you're free for now. I'll call you when it's time to prepare everything for serving. In the meantime, make sure you eat something, because I doubt there'll be a scrap of meat left. Too many guests for even a bone to remain. So go get some vegetables and make a soup for you and the other pages,\" said the head servant, tasting the stew in a pot with a critical frown.\n\"Great… more work,\" I muttered, deadpan.\nI grabbed a medium-sized pot and left the tent. I walked toward the one assigned to me for sleeping, passing by the guards setting up the perimeter. I noticed a pile of firewood someone had left a bit too carelessly near the communal fire, and without being noticed, I took a few small pieces.\nI crouched beside a clear patch of dirt, pulled out my knife, and started shaving thin strips of wood. Then, using a flint and a piece of metal I'd picked up somewhere, I struck sparks. It took a while, but eventually, one caught. I blew gently until the fire took hold. Once stable, I added the stolen wood and set the pot on top.\nI walked over to one of the barrels near the carts and filled it with some water. When I got back, I quickly chopped a few small carrots and two leftover potatoes. That was all I had.\n\"Shit… I'm gonna go hungry today…\" I muttered, staring at the watery soup, full of hope but lacking flavor. \"I guess… no one would notice if I borrowed a bow… right?\" I said under my breath, scanning the surroundings.\nEveryone was busy. No one was watching me.\nCasually, I approached the armory tent. No one stopped me, no one asked anything. I took the smallest bow I could find, one just my size. It was a bit bigger than the training one I had back home. I also \"borrowed\" a quiver half-full of arrows and slipped out as silently as I'd entered.\nI headed into the woods.\nIt had been months since I last trained with a bow. At the margrave's estate, all we had was fencing and horseback training. The only experience I had was from the year before, when I'd been gifted my first practice bow. This one was different… heavier, tighter, far harder to use. Probably made for grown men, not boys.\nI wasn't aiming for a big catch. Just something I could kill, cook, and toss into the pot. Anything with meat: a hare, a bird, some feathered critter. Anything. So I moved quietly, stepping with care, even holding my breath. I wasn't a hunter—nowhere close. Honestly, I had more hope than skill. But hunger works miracles. And need makes even the clumsiest get creative.\nBefore long, I spotted my first target. A decent-sized bird pecking at seeds on the ground a few meters ahead. It hadn't seen me.\nI drew an arrow from the quiver, set it to the string, took my stance…\nAnd couldn't pull the bow.\nThe damn thing was stiff as stone. I tried again, this time putting all my back into it. Managed to draw it. I clenched my jaw, aimed as best I could, held my breath… and released.\nThe bird took off immediately. The arrow landed meters away, buried in the dirt. Didn't even come close. Total disaster.\nI grunted quietly, retrieved the arrow, and kept looking. And so it went: miss, adjust, miss again. Some arrows flew meters off, others just a few centimeters. But I wasn't hitting anything.\nI was getting irritated at my own incompetence. My hands trembled from the effort and my stomach didn't even growl anymore—it just burned. But there was no way I was going back empty-handed. If I was going to \"borrow\" a bow and quiver, I'd at least return with something decent to offer in silence. Some \"gift\" to make them forget the temporary disappearance of the gear.\nI kept prowling between the trees. Saw more birds, but now I moved slower, more carefully. Then I spotted a nest, high on a branch. From below, I saw one of the birds pecking at the edge. I repeated the process: arrow, string, stance. Drew the bow. My arm muscles screamed, but I held. I clenched my teeth, aimed. Released.\nThere was a violent fluttering, followed by a heavy thud on the ground.\nI ran over, heart pounding. There it was. I hit it. Dead on.\nThe bird was still twitching, so without hesitation, I twisted its neck to end it quickly. Its body relaxed. The arrow had destroyed part of its side, so it wouldn't look too pretty in the pot, but it was something. I climbed the tree carefully and claimed four eggs from the nest, tucking them gently into a cloth pouch.\nI didn't know how much time had passed, but the sun was still high. I doubted anyone had noticed my absence yet. So I decided to push my luck a bit more. I kept wandering, though my shots were weaker now, less steady. My arm was shaking, and it was hard just to hold the bow straight.\nThen, just as I'd decided to head back, something moved in the grass. Crouched among the bushes, I saw it: a white rabbit. Beautiful, already wearing its winter coat. It looked like a patch of snow in the middle of the forest.\nI didn't have the strength to use the bow, so I went for the oldest weapon in the world: a rock.\nThe rabbit was nervously scanning its surroundings. It had sensed me, but didn't know where the danger was coming from. I moved slowly, carefully, holding my breath. When I was close enough, I hurled the rock with all the precision I could muster.\nIt hit the rabbit square in the head.\nIt tried to run, but its body didn't respond. It twitched, dragging itself with limp hind legs. I rushed in and grabbed it with both hands.\n\"Sorry, little guy… this is gonna hurt you a lot more than it hurts me,\" I whispered, pushing its head down and snapping its neck in one swift motion.\nI held it in my hands, still warm. It was a beautiful animal—white fur, perfect for winter. But in that green environment, it stood out like a beacon. Even I could catch it. I gave it a quick inspection and I put it on my belt. along with the bird and the eggs. Now I had a decent excuse for my absence.\nI started heading back, but it seemed luck wasn't with me. I ran right into Joachim. He had a bow in his hands and was probably doing the same thing I was. We both froze, staring at each other.\n\"What are you doing here… you should be—\" he started.\n\"—yeah, at the camp,\" I cut him off, flatly.\n\"You're in serious trouble…\" he said with a smirk, glancing down. \"You got a rabbit… and a bird… but how? You and your father… my father always says yours is more like a northern barbarian than an Imperial noble, and looks like you're not much different.\"\n\"Oh? Really?\" I replied, thinking fast. I noticed his eyes were fixed on my catch.\n\"Give me the rabbit and the bird and I didn't see anything,\" Joachim said, like he was offering a favor.\n\"Hey… hey, I did this to eat,\" I replied, holding his gaze.\n\"Or would you prefer lashes for sneaking off… and stealing that bow… and the arrows?\" he said, knowing full well he had the upper hand. His smile was that of someone already feeling victorious.\n\"Maybe I'd prefer that over letting someone else take credit for my work,\" I said, serious.\n\"Stubborn little bastard… fine, give me the rabbit and you keep the bird,\" said Joachim, sighing and running a hand down his face.\n\"And what are you going to do with it?\" I asked, holding it out toward him.\n\"Show it to father. A white rabbit in summer… that's good luck for a hunter,\" Joachim replied, still staring at it.\n\"You're not even going to eat it? If you want, I can skin it and you can show it to your father,\" I said, a bit annoyed.\n\"It needs to look like I hunted it… or he'll think I stole it from someone… ha, ha,\" he chuckled, reaching out.\n\"Fine… here you go. Now shut your mouth, or I'll open mine to your father,\" I said, handing him the rabbit.\n\"You have my word… how did you kill it? No arrow wound… just… ew, one of its eyes is out… ew,\" said Joachim as he examined it.\n\"I threw a rock and broke its neck… like this, see,\" I said, repeating the movement.\n\"I see… he'll ask how I learned. He always does, never misses a detail,\" Joachim said as he started walking back toward the camp.\n\"Tell him you asked me… that you figured, being the son of a northern barbarian, I'd know some tricks… and I'll back you up,\" I said, continuing with what I had left in my hands.\nWe returned to camp, and I quickly returned everything I had \"borrowed\" before sitting down to pluck the bird, gut it with a knife, and start cutting it into pieces. I traded two legs for some salt a guard had on hand, and then realized someone had moved the soup because it was already done. I took the chance and tossed the bird pieces into the broth,wait,and serving myself a bowl.\nBy the time I was on my second helping, the others began arriving, tired.\n\"Nice, it's ready… I cut my hands like four times… hey Albrecht, where did you get… chicken?\" one of the pages asked, grabbing a wooden bowl to serve himself.\n\"What? They said they'd wait until after the feast to hand out meat… did you steal it?\" said another, already helping himself.\n\"Eat and shut up, or you can wait hours until they're done drinking wine. And if anyone opens their mouth, I'll break their legs at the next training. Understood?\" I said, looking at the group. Even though they were older than me, none dared face me alone.\nEveryone started eating, taking a small piece of meat I'd left so they'd all be complicit.\n\"Good… everyone ate. If anyone talks, we all go down…\" I said, picking food from between my teeth with a finger.\nTheir faces lit up at the taste of something decent instead of another bland stew.\n\"What are you looking at? Eat, you ungrateful bastards. I do something nice for you and you're more worried about a punishment that won't come. If no one talks, there's no guilt,\" I said, stretching.\nI heard footsteps approaching the tent and immediately stood to block the entrance with my body.\n\"Al… Albrecht… father wants to see you,\" said Joachim, looking tense.\n\"Of course, I always have time for his lordship,\" I replied, stepping out quickly and following Joachim and his guards.\nWe entered one of the largest tents in the camp, where the air was heavy with spices and the guests were stuffing themselves with endless luxuries. The margrave was sipping wine and speaking with the same dwarf from earlier, who held a mug of ale.\n\"Father… uh…\" Joachim started.\n\"Albrecht, my son says you taught him one of your father's tricks. Is that true?\" asked the margrave without delay.\n\"Of course, my lord. Who would I be to refuse help to someone of your lineage? I'm here to serve you,\" I answered with a serious face, looking him straight in the eye.\n\"Really… you're not lying to me?\" said the margrave, adjusting in his seat and leaning toward me.\n\"You really think I'm dumb enough to lie to your face, margrave?\" I said with an innocent expression.\nThe margrave laughed, licked his lips, and stared at his son.\n\"Seriously, Joachim?\" said the margrave.\n'Because this idiot couldn't lie half as well as he struts around acting arrogant…' I thought.\n\"Yes, father… he helped me,\" Joachim said, trembling from nerves.\nThe margrave shook his head and looked at me.\n\"Very well. Tomorrow we go for big game… no more small prey. So, Albrecht, you'll go with my son,\" said the margrave.\n\"What… an honor… margrave,\" I said with the fakest smile I could muster.\n\"Yes, a great honor… now go,\" said the margrave, and Joachim led me outside.\n\"You owe me one,\" I said as we walked side by side.\nHe just scowled at me and grabbed a tray from a servant.\n\"I don't owe you anything,\" he said, handing me a tray full of roasted meats.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ\n\"See you tomorrow,\" I said with a grin, quickening my pace, almost running with the food.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

      "content": "I would appreciate it if you could post reviews about what you think of the story so far.\n-------------------------------\nI woke up violently, twisting around and grabbing the potato-peeling knife from my belt, breathing hard, heart pounding in my ears.\n\"Shit... again... I'm not in Ukraine, goddammit... not anymore... not anymore,\" I muttered through clenched teeth, trembling.\nI'd barely slept. Every crack in the forest, every snapping branch, every distant step from a guard triggered my reflexes like I was still in the trenches.\n\"Again, Albrecht?\" someone mumbled from under their blanket, stirring without even opening their eyes. \"The sun's not even up yet… still too early for you to enjoy the hunt.\"\n\"Ungrateful bastard… this is how you repay me for sharing my prize,\" I grumbled, putting the knife away and trying to steady my breathing.\nI got up and stepped outside the tent. I went to the nearest water barrel and splashed my face several times.\nSomething in this forest made my gut churn. I had never reacted like this… not even when artillery rained down on us. There was something in the air, in the way dawn crept between the trees, that gave me a bad feeling I couldn't explain.\nLuckily, I'd prepared one of my tricks last night. I took the largest piece of meat from the banquet and boiled it down into jelly with some vegetables. Since the meat was already well seasoned, I didn't need to add anything. I just added flour. Once it hardened, I ground it down into a kind of broth tablet. I only had to throw it into boiling water to make a decent soup. And the best part: as long as no one saw it, I wouldn't have to share with anyone.\nI tossed the tablet into a wooden bowl and poured in boiling water. I started drinking the flavorful broth, still rich with the spices from yesterday's meat. No idea what animal it was, but it was salty and tingled a bit on the tongue. That strong, meaty taste felt good when hot.\nAs I drank, the camp started to wake up, the men stirring and moving about. I stayed close to the wagons, where I was supposed to wait for the rest of the hunting party, noticing crates with tied-up pigs nearby.\n\"Ugh… these bastards denying us a single scrap of meat while keeping these nice fat pigs here,\" I muttered, looking at the cart's contents.\nWhen I saw the nobles starting to arrive, I prepared my horse and waited patiently, with a second bowl of soup and a piece of bread I'd stolen from a careless servant.\nThe margrave came out but ignored me entirely, heading to join the other nobles dressed in fine clothes, looking like upper-rank bureaucrats.\n\"Albrecht,\" came Joachim's familiar voice, though strangely lacking its usual arrogance.\n\"Yeah?\" I answered after finishing the bowl.\n\"What do you mean 'yeah'? Shouldn't it be 'at your service, my lord'?\" he added, arrogance returning to his tone.\n\"That's for your father… or when you beat me in a spar, Lord Sculpted Legs,\" I said with a smirk, grinning with irony.\n\"You should be ashamed to fight like that,\" Joachim replied.\n\"You need to learn to control that ego, Joachim… you fall for provocations too easily. And as much as I'd like to keep pushing your buttons, looks like we're heading out soon. So… you ready?\" I said, leaning on my thigh while keeping my horse steady by the reins.\n\"Have you ever hunted wild boar?\" Joachim asked.\n\"Not personally… but my father likes to talk about how he stalks prey. He likes to take his time with the hunt, and he's always very detailed about it,\" I said, looking out toward the horizon, mentally preparing for what was coming.\n\"Good… I can always count on you and your northern barbarian tactics,\" Joachim said, relaxing a bit. \"So now you're going to help me hunt one,\" he added proudly.\n\"Are you crazy? That's one of the most dangerous things to hunt, and you expect me to help?\" I replied, raising an eyebrow and surveying the area.\n\"My father said he'd take me on the next military campaign to clear some mountain passes of orcs. If I bring back a big game trophy—a boar or a stag—it would be enough,\" Joachim explained, his eyes gleaming with excitement.\n\"Ha… good luck with that. A stag needs a skilled archer, and I can barely pull a small bow. Even if I hit one, I doubt it'd die. And boars are hunted with spears and hounds. I don't see any dogs with you,\" I said, holding back a laugh.\n\"If I manage to get you out of the worst chores in your service, would you consider it?\" Joachim asked, sounding nervous.\n\"I'd be risking my hide… though not having to clean the damn latrines sounds fantastic… I get to keep some of the meat, though. Deal?\" I offered my hand with a cocky smile.\n\"Fine…\" Joachim said, brushing off my hand. \"Grab a few spears. We're going.\"\n\"And who's coming with us?\" I asked, noticing we were heading out alone.\n\"Just two guards. The rest are going with my father's group,\" Joachim said.\n\"Lovely,\" I muttered, dismounting.\nI grabbed a couple of spears from what was available, some rope, and also took a bow and a few boxes. Better to have them and not need them than need them and not have them. We set off quickly, heading into the forest.\nWe rode until the terrain flattened out, always scanning the area. We kept going until something caught my eye.\nI dismounted and saw clear signs of what I was looking for, remembering what father always said when talking about how he stalked prey in the woods.\n\"Look here, these tracks are from a boar… see the ground? One clearly used its tusks here to dig for something,\" I said, crouching and examining the marks.\nJoachim rode up and looked at me, puzzled. \"You sure? How do you know it's a boar?\"\n\"Honestly? I don't. But it's worth trying here,\" I said, scanning for a nearby tree.\n\"And now what? Where do we look?\" Joachim asked, glancing around.\n\"You and I climb that big tree over there. We'll toss some food beneath it. If we can get up to the branches, we'll be able to see if a boar comes from afar. The food should draw it in, and from above, we throw the spear. With some luck, we pierce a lung or the heart,\" I explained, pointing at the large nearby tree.\n\"You sure?\" he asked, still skeptical. \"Is that one of your father's techniques?\"\n\"Yeah, my father's,\" I replied, carefully keeping secret the fact that he actually used hounds and preferred to hunt personally—while I was using a method I saw in a video once when I was bored in Africa.\nI started climbing the tree, making my way up to a high branch that was well covered in leaves. My clothes, in dull tones, blended perfectly with the surroundings, but Joachim's weren't as camouflaged. His bright colors made him easy to spot, so I told him to cover himself with a piece of cloth I had brought to sleep with, just in case we needed to camp away from the main camp.\nI made sure to tie the rope around my torso and secure it to the tree for safety. I took position, two spears in hand, keeping watch for any movement in the area.\nJoachim began to climb, but obviously, he wasn't very skilled at it. He needed the guards' help to get up, and once he was halfway there, I had to climb back down to give him a hand getting onto the branch where he'd be decently hidden.\nThe guards began tossing down bread and some grain that was supposedly for them and the horses. Then they withdrew, leaving just Joachim and me up in the tree.\nFor long minutes, we stayed in silence, observing the area, alert for any sign of movement.\n\"Hey, how much lo—\" Joachim started.\n\"Shhh…\" I gestured for silence, putting a finger to my lips, and we focused again on the wait.\nWe stayed like that for hours atop the tree, watchful. A few rabbits came near, attracted by the bait, but we scared them off quickly. As expected, they darted away in the opposite direction.\nSuddenly, a group of deer approached, but they must have seen Joachim's colorful clothes and got spooked, fleeing instantly. The wait was starting to wear on Joachim, and he looked close to losing patience when finally, we heard something in the distance.\nI turned my head and saw a group of five wild boars approaching. I looked at Joachim and saw the excitement in his eyes.\n\"Let them come closer… go for the male, on the count of three,\" I whispered as we watched the boars get nearer.\nWe waited calmly as they approached. I needed Joachim to stay focused, so I kept my hand open, signaling that we had to wait for the right moment. The boar had to get close enough to expose its vital spots.\nWhen we had a clear angle, I raised three fingers at Joachim and slowly lowered them one by one. I took my spear and threw it. Joachim did the same.\nMy spear hit the mark, piercing the boar's lung. It began to grunt in pain, thrashing at the weapon while blood poured from its snout. It tried to flee but collapsed not far from us.\nJoachim's spear struck the young boar, piercing its spine and killing it instantly. The rest of the group fled the area.\n\"good, damn it…\" I muttered, staring at my downed prey.\n\"Yes!\" Joachim shouted, beginning to climb down.\n\"Hey—hold on. Mine's still alive! Wait until it bleeds out a bit before we go down,\" I said, grabbing the second spear.\nJoachim sighed, and we waited a few more minutes. Once the boar's spasms stopped, we untied ourselves from the ropes and climbed down.\n\"For a young one, it's pretty big. It must've been nearly full-grown,\" I said, pulling the spear from the wound and tying up its legs.\n\"Yeah… perfect. Let's check the other one now, the one that actually matters. Unlike this one, that one died instantly. A perfect throw,\" said Joachim.\n\"Meh… you got lucky. I said to go for the male, and you hit the young one, which you weren't supposed to do… but we can smoke it and make some nice ham out of it. Or, since it's young, roast it with some vinegar so the skin crisps up,\" I said, thinking about what we could do with the day's catch.\nWe finally reached the adult boar, and I got ready in case it moved.\n\"It's dead. Look at that beauty of a hit—I got both lungs,\" I said, pulling out the spear and inspecting the hole it had made. \"Alright, let's bring the horses and get out of here before the blood draws in some predator.\"\nAs we started moving through the open area, we caught the attention of the guards, who quickly arrived with the horses. We wasted no time getting the prey onto their mounts and began heading back.\nAs we rode deeper into the forest, I stayed alert to every sound. With a bleeding animal among us, it wouldn't be strange to attract a wolf or two, and we had to be ready for a pack. The air felt heavy, charged with a tension I couldn't ignore.\nWhile I kept scanning the surroundings, something caught my attention at the edge of the treeline. I saw a tall, muscular figure covered in thick fur. I couldn't take my eyes off the abomination standing right in front of us.\n\"Beastman!\" I shouted, pointing at the creature as it approached with steady, deliberate steps.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nMy cry of alarm rang through the air, and everyone stopped in their tracks.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

      "content": "I would appreciate it if you could post reviews about what you think of the story so far.\n-------------------------------\nI stood still, watching the creature. It was one thing to see an illustration or hear my father talk about how to hunt one, and something entirely different to have it right in front of me.\nIt was pure muscle—tall, with thick arms and some armor on its legs. But everything else was covered in thick fur, and its head was like that of a ram, with horns curled backward. Its mouth was full of a mix of saliva and blood, which only added to the grotesque sight. In its hands it held a large chunk of metal that resembled a sword, though it looked horribly made—like some blacksmith had forged it without the slightest idea of what he was doing.\nThe guards, seeing the threat, drew their swords quickly and moved to stand between us and the beastman, trying at the same time to keep their horses under control, as the animals grew restless from the creature's presence.\nThe stench was unbearable—a mix of rotting meat and a dense stink, like the latrines of a barracks. It came from its thick fur and sweat, clinging to the air and making me want to cover my nose. Breathing grew harder with every step the beast took.\nLuckily, the guards—though clearly tense—were well-armed knights, as expected from the Margrave's men. Clad in full plate armor, they began to position themselves, ready to face the threat.\n\"It's just one. I'll distract him, you flank,\" said one of the guards, pointing his sword toward the creature as it prepared to charge.\nThe other guard nodded and began guiding his horse sideways while the beastman growled, as if gauging the perfect moment to strike.\n\"Joachim, don't wander off. Look—\" I started to say, turning to the one we were supposed to protect, when something in the brush caught my eye.\n\"Another one—watch out!\" I shouted as I saw another of those creatures burst out from behind a tree, a massive brute wielding a large axe, rushing at Joachim with terrifying speed.\nJoachim managed to turn just enough to use his horse as a shield. The beast struck hard, almost beheading the mount in one swing.the horse staggered and collapsed, Joachim falling backward, narrowly avoiding having his leg crushed under the beast's weight. The horse, in its death throes, kicked wildly, not realizing it was already dead.\nI didn't think. I spurred my horse into a gallop and grabbed one of my spears. I hurled it with all the force I had, aiming at the beastman advancing on the Margrave's son.\nThe spear flew through the air and hit the beast in the chest, near the right side, but it didn't pierce as deeply as I'd hoped—probably because of its tough hide or because I lacked an adult's strength. Wasting no time, I grabbed the second spear, held it with both hands, and aimed directly for the heart.\nThe beast yanked the first spear from its chest, growling furiously, and raised its weapon to strike me. Before it could reach me, the second spear drove deep into the center of its chest, and just then, my horse rammed into it, sending the beast flying.\nNow disarmed and unsure of how durable these things really were, I chose not to take chances. I spurred my horse again and had it stomp hard on the beastman. Again and again, I made it trample the creature's torso and head until it stopped moving. After several hits, the beast finally lay still, lifeless.\nI turned and saw Joachim still in shock, and the guards had already killed the first beastman—but more were coming. The guards were readying themselves to face two more beastmen heading their way.\nI looked down and saw the second spear I had thrown was broken, but the first one—still stained with the beast's foul blood—was intact.\nI approached Joachim, dismounted, and grabbed the spear.\n\"Snap out of it, idiot,\" I said, slapping him twice as I breathed heavily. \"Get on my horse and wait. If I come back without you, your father's going to kill me anyway.\"\n\"The boar…\" Joachim muttered, looking at the boar carcass tied to the horse.\n\"What the hell does that matter now? You need to live, dumbass,\" I said, grabbing his clothes and helping him up onto my horse.\nFinally, Joachim got on. I took my spear and looked toward the two remaining beastmen who were still fighting the knights. These ones were smarter. They used the trees, their branches, and roots to deny the horses any advantage. They kept ducking behind cover and only came out when they could strike with surprise.\nI moved in from the right, and while one of the beastmen was distracted, I stabbed my spear into its thigh. I heard the creature grunt and snarl in pain as I twisted the spear to inflict a wound that would bleed it out. I pulled the spear free with effort and retreated behind one of the knights.\nThe beast, enraged, tried to go after me, but the knight's sword came down fast, severing its arm in a single blow. What looked like an iron club dropped to the ground, useless.\nTaking advantage of the creature writhing in pain, I used the full reach of my spear and drove it into its neck, twisting it again. The hole I left was deep. The knight quickly moved to assist his companion.\nThe beast, cornered, stood atop the roots of a tree, swinging blindly, trying to keep the knights at bay.\n\"Boy, give me the spear. Don't take the risk,\" said one of the knights, clearly reading my intention to finish it off.\nI tossed him the spear, and almost instantly he hurled it with force, pinning the beastman against the tree. Meanwhile, the other knight dismounted and rushed forward, slicing off the creature's head with his sword.\nThe danger seemed to be over, and the knights were starting to clean their swords of the beasts' blood.\n\"The page killed two…\" one knight said, looking at the beast I had stomped to a pulp with my horse's hooves and the one I had speared through the neck.\n\"Sounds like a damn joke… but yeah, the boy's got guts. Let's get out of here before more of those things show up.\"\nTaking advantage of the moment, I grabbed the boar from Joachim's horse and loaded it onto one of the knights'. Then I got back on my own horse, riding alongside Joachim, and in silence we began the return to camp. We didn't spot any more beastmen, but kept our distance, following the same trail back without further incident.\nAfter a long while of scanning the woods around us for any sign of danger, we finally made it back to camp.\nI let out a breath of relief, glad to finally be out of that mess. I'd rather watch from afar than be the one fighting those stinking monsters up close.\nI took the young boar Joachim had killed—until he presented it to his father and got what he wanted, it was still mine. I got a knife from the butcher and began prepping it. First, I cut it down from the rope holding it up and laid it on a clean surface. I started slicing along its belly with the knife, careful not to puncture the organs. Its skin was soft but thick, and I had to make careful cuts to peel it without tearing it too much.\nI separated the hide from the meat in steady motions, cutting around the legs, ears, and head, keeping the hide mostly intact. The smell wasn't anywhere near as bad as those beasts we had just fought.\nOnce the hide was off, I began cutting the meat into smaller portions. I started with the hind legs—they were the thickest—then moved on to the back and flanks. Even young, it had a strong flavor that could spoil if not handled properly.\nI placed the cuts on a table, ready to be smoked if needed. Wild boar meat is tougher than most, so it would need special preparation.\nAfter what felt like a long time working, I began to set up a rack made of sticks and string to hang the cuts, letting the heat and smoke do their job. The scent of curing meat began mixing with the fresh forest air. I was completely focused when someone finally came to interrupt me.\n\"Uh… uh… wow… they must be drunk… ah, the Margrave has summoned you,\" said a knight who approached me.\nI nodded and followed him into the tent, where many nobles and guests were gathered in a festive atmosphere. There was tension in the air, but clearly, for now, the nobles didn't care about the beastmen threat. I noticed that the head of the boar I had killed was decorating the center of one of the banquet trays, like a trophy.\nThe Margrave, upon seeing it, ran his hands down his face, visibly tired.\n\"Albrecht… I've just been told you were attacked by beastmen during the hunt… but when they briefed me, they told me the absurd claim that you killed two yourself…\" said the Margrave, with a surprised look on his face.\n\"Not two… but one, yes. With the other, I helped by spearing it through the thigh to flush it out so the knight could land his blow, and I finished it off,\" I replied quickly, without dressing it up.\nThe Margrave leaned back in his chair, licked his lips, as if unsure whether to believe me.\n\"Come, walk with me,\" he said, motioning for me to follow.\nI walked with him to what looked like his private tent. The Margrave poured himself a cup of wine, drank slowly, then looked straight at me.\n\"Listen… thank you for saving my son. It never even crossed my mind that there might be beastmen in that area when I let you go hunting. The trackers told me it was safe…\" said the Margrave, his face serious, thoughtful.\n\"It was my duty,\" I answered, without much emotion.\n\"If it weren't for you, I'd have lost my son by my own fault,\" the Margrave said, almost as if thinking out loud.\n\"Your fault?\" I asked, puzzled.\n\"The hunt is meant to hunt beastmen… to test weapons… all those rich bastards from Altdorf fight to get invited, chasing the thrill of killing chaos beasts with little risk. I charged a mountain of gold to bring several guests here, and I arranged for baits beastmen couldn't resist… your father's advice,\" the Margrave said.\n\"Oh… brutalized pigs? Or deformed babies to lure them in…?\" I said, recalling my father's tricks.\n\"Yes… seems you know too. Your father has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. He said the more brutal the bloodshed, the more it draws them in like flies. And today we were testing weapons from our friend in the mountains to hunt them… didn't think some would stray off. If you were a squire, I'd say you're worthy of being knighted,\" said the Margrave, a hint of admiration in his tone.\n\"Thank you, my lord…\" I replied, trying to sound respectful, though I already knew what was coming.\n\"But you're not, so don't get your hopes up. When you're twelve, I'll let you become a squire early… now go back to whatever you were doing,\" said the Margrave, refilling his cup with wine.\nAnd with nothing else to say, I returned to my task.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Though to be honest, they sounded more like explosions, since black powder released a massive cloud of smoke. There wasn't any system to direct or muffle the sound, so it echoed for kilometers.\nAll I can say is that the Margrave had built himself a hell of a business. All he did was set up the bait and hand out weapons to groups of nobles, who then showered him in gold for the chance to kill a beastman, cut off its head, and use it as a trophy. The camp had changed a lot in the last few days.\nIt had filled with artists and writers painting nobles beside the corpses of slain beasts, mimicking some of the iconic poses of Sigmar. The writers filled pages with stories about the nobility of the hunt. Taxidermists had also arrived, working the hides into decorative mounts to make the beasts look almost alive.\nIt was a parade of idiots emptying their wallets in exchange for a bit of glory and prestige back in the capital—trying to present themselves as beast-slayers in the eyes of Altdorf's citizens, fueling political campaigns, romantic pursuits, and, of course, the cult of Sigmar, fulfilling its mandate to wipe out all evil within the Empire's reach.\nFortunately, I was making a profit too. The Margrave had thanked me for saving his heir, and released me from any duty during this time. And for a while, there was only one topic at the banquet—my father. Apparently, he had been a famed beastman hunter and an accomplished carroburg greatswords. In his youth, he hunted those monsters wherever they lurked, and after retiring from the regiment as a baron, he continued the hunt without rest, keeping his lands nearly free of that threat.\nAnd when the news spread that I, barely ten years old, had already killed two beastmen, they immediately saw me as his successor. My father would've been puffing his chest with pride if he had heard about it.\nI took the opportunity to sell my family's \"expertise\" to help the nobles hunt.\nThe truth is, it was all about being smart—reading the terrain, spotting the best places for visibility, and knowing what lured the beasts. With the knowledge my father passed down through long talks about his hunts, and a bit of what I'd read, I was on par with the experienced local hunters. And for what I was charging… no, let's be honest, I was scamming the city nobles—selling them \"valuable advice\" for a handful of gold coins, just to point out the best spots to find their prey.\nWhile they prepped their gear, I stayed busy, waiting a few minutes until finally, a beastman appeared, drawn by the blood of a sacrificial pig that had been splashed across the ground. I watched them use their weapons, taking down a few beasts or small groups. My job was to help carry the bodies back to camp, holding out my hand as we returned.\nThe nobles, thrilled with their successful hunts, handed me small bags of silver coins, and sometimes a gold one. In a single week, I was probably earning more than a peasant would in ten years. And all because I was riding on my father's reputation as a beastman hunter.\nI piled up the gold and silver coins I had earned—forty gold coins and nine hundred forty-two in silver. A small fortune to some, a minor shopping spree for others.\nI had planned to buy a dwarven arquebus, but they were extremely expensive. A quality model went for around one hundred fifty gold crowns, which left me with just over half the cost. The beastman presence was growing—probably due to the high concentration of humans in the area, the amount of bait used, and the corpses left behind. They only took the heads and left the rest to rot, the stench drawing more in. Leaving camp without a good position was becoming more dangerous by the day.\nSo I decided to use my earnings on something that could help me stay alive while I kept charging these city nobles. It pained me, but I spent ten crowns buying a hunting spear from that dwarf… or rather, that professional swindler. Still, the spear was the best I'd seen—razor sharp, with a shaft made of what looked like sturdy wood. It should hold up well enough. That said, a state army-grade spear would've cost a quarter of that price but the quality are very different .Thɪs\nThe most expensive part, surprisingly, was buying fabric and paint from the artists. I had to act fast—I had no clue how to make pigments or which plants to look for. So I found a painter who wasn't having much success selling his services and bought the paints he had—moss green, black, brown, and grey—and started painting the fabric.\nOnce the fabric dried, I used needle and thread to add a second layer to my clothes, which now looked like a decent bit of camouflage, trying to imitate forest colors.\nIf things went south during a hunt, this might help me get away. Survival wasn't guaranteed, but I was hoping with all my heart that this costly attempt at camouflage would actually work and not backfire on me. For all I knew, it could make me stand out more and turn me into a giant target. I even draped the fabric over my horse, painted the same way, tying it down with the saddle straps, leaving everything covered except for the head.\n\"All set,\" said the city noble who'd hired me as his guide, eyeing my outfit. \"New local fashion trend?\"\n\"No… uhhh… yes… fashion…\" I replied, changing my mind before explaining what it actually was.\n\"Better than anything I've seen in Altdorf, honestly… Alright, I need you to take me somewhere with a decent number of beastmen. I want to kill a lot, to be honest,\" said the noble as he mounted his horse.\n\"How many escorts do you have?\" I asked as we neared the camp's edge.\n\"Fifty,\" the noble replied.\nI came to a sudden stop. \"A lot of men for a hunt? What are you planning?\" I asked, staring at him.\n\"Gaining prestige. I'm aiming for a position in Altdorf's city courts and, well, killing a large number of these abominations never hurts in securing the support of the Cult of Sigmar… and, well, a minotaur,\" said the noble.\n\"You're insane… those things are extremely dangerous. That should be a job for a state regiment,\" I replied to his request.\n\"I'm not insane… I'm well prepared,\" said the noble as he kept riding and motioned toward his escort.\n\"Damn… no expense spared here. Plate armor, all of them armed with arquebuses… these are regiments grade, right?\" I asked as I observed the escort arquebuses.\n\"No. A custom order from a gunsmith in Nuln. I understand you're a Reinfield. My father met yours back when he worked in his court—a bar fight case from a few decades ago. Your father killed three commoners and a noble with his bare hands. My father described him as a beast that knew no fear and a hound when it came to beastmen. I thought you, young as you are, would be the same… maybe even better. Everyone's talking about how you killed a Gor by yourself… but maybe I was wrong. Are you afraid?\" the noble asked, staring at me.\n\"Ha, ha, ha… what a pathetic attempt to use my pride to motivate me. I'm brave… I'm a damn hunting dog that won't let go of its prey until it's dead… but I'm not stupid. Minotaurs are rarely alone—and often accompanied by decent groups of beastmen. So, I suggest you take that hand out of your pocket and pay me a lot more than what we agreed on,\" I said with a grin.\nHe let out a smug snort. \"Fine… how much do you want?\" the noble asked, clearly pleased with himself.\n\"We agreed on six crowns. I want fifty if I manage to find you a minotaur… per head,\" I replied.\n\"Outrageous… but no local hunter accepted my offer, so deal, Reinfield. Lead us,\" said the noble, and his entire escort started following us.\nStealth was definitely off the table with all that metal clanging around. We'd be attracting the attention of everything nearby. Fortunately, after so many outings, I was familiar with the nearby terrain and knew how to move so we could always be in a favorable position—whether on horseback or atop a hill with a wide field of view.\nThe sound of the arquebuses was like cannon fire. The escorts didn't flinch. As soon as a beastman stepped within seventy meters, it was left with a fist-sized hole in its chest.\nApparently, my outfit was working, because at one point I made eye contact with two beastmen, and they didn't notice me until they picked up my scent. So it's fair to say the investment paid off.\nIt was always the same: move ahead, scan the area, climb a tall tree to scout the surroundings, spot the next tree or high point with a good view, and continue. Every now and then, I'd hide among the escort and let them handle the beasts trailing us.\nSeveral hours passed, and some of the extra horses pulling carts were now loaded with Gor and Ungor heads.\nOn one of my climbs, I noticed something—two massive figures moving toward us. I couldn't tell exactly what they were, but it was obvious they were huge and close.\nI climbed down quickly, agile on the branches, then mounted my horse and galloped back to the city noble's group.\n\"Two… very big and very angry ones nearby,\" I said, pointing in the direction I had seen them.\n\"Excellent… this turned out to be easier than I thought… worth every coin I'll pay you, Reinfield,\" said the noble.\n\"Hey, it's not over yet. We still have the hardest part left—killing them. So don't start celebrating just yet,\" I replied.\n\"Advice? Is there a place where we can get a good position to fire all our weapons at once?\" asked the noble.\n\"The hill where I climbed the tree had few trees. It could give you a clear view of the targets. The problem is they might have already left the area. We need someone to catch their attention and lure them into the kill zone. Then everything will be ready,\" I said, pointing at the tree.\n\"Alright, let's go… Reinfield, lure them toward us.yes I'm paying you extra, I'm not sending someone wrapped in steel to be chased by minotaurs. So get to it,\" the noble said before I could charge him more.\nWithout another word, I spurred my horse toward where the minotaurs should be. I started shouting. In one of those shouts, I saw them—massive figures with bull heads and eyes glowing red with rage staring straight at me.\n\"Alright, I've got their attention… time to run,\" I said, spurring the horse toward the hill.\nI could hear the heavy stomps behind me. Those beasts were charging fast.\n\"If they had sent one of the guys in armor, he'd be dinner already,\" I said as I looked back and saw the minotaurs dangerously close.\nI kept riding and finally reached the hill. I saw the noble's escorts already in position, aiming their arquebuses. I galloped laterally to their line, and soon the familiar roar of gunfire erupted.\nA massive wall of smoke rose. I turned back and saw the two minotaurs on the ground, trying to get up. Their bodies were riddled with holes, growling in fury, pouring blood from their mouths and noses. One of their arms gave out, collapsing beneath its own weight.\nThe noble didn't hesitate. He came out holding a spear and, with perfect aim, drove it into their necks, finishing both with a single, precise thrust.\nOne of his escorts, armed with an axe, started cutting off the heads. Both were loaded onto the carts, and we returned to camp, collecting three more dozen heads just on the way back.\nBack at camp, I was handed a small chest full of gold coins—probably more than I had asked for.\nThe noble looked quite pleased with his prize, and during the entire day's banquet, he was the center of attention, telling everyone how he bravely slew two minotaurs on his own. I didn't have to wait long to see him being painted by an artist, with one minotaur's head beneath his feet, while a taxidermist worked on the other.\n\"The extra… is for the silence,\" I said while watching him pose.\nBy the next day, I already had a line of city nobles wanting to pay me to take them to the minotaurs. Though few of them had the same level of escort as the noble aspiring to be a judge.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The nobles fought to find someone with the right knowledge to guarantee them a successful hunt, so they could brag to their friends and rivals about how brave they were for killing a few beastmen. I didn't care about keeping my mouth shut, as long as they paid me well to take them to the best hunting spots—safe places where they could puff up their egos and boast about their victories.\nThe hunt lasted nearly another month, and although my job was simple, something in the air told me it all had an expiration date. And, to my dismay, the Margrave eventually decided to call off the hunt, claiming that thousands of beastmen had been taken down by the noble forces involved in the event.\nThe makeshift marketplace that had formed around the needs of the nobles began to disperse once word spread that the Margrave was withdrawing his troops. That meant most of the security in the area was also leaving. The soldiers were moved toward Osburg to prevent any kind of retaliation from the beastmen after the Margrave's protection disappeared.Follow current novᴇls on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nIt was a heavy blow for those who arrived late—surprisingly, some of the biggest players had shown up in the final weeks of the hunt. Mostly nobles with deep pockets who had no issue paying for my services, knowing that every hunt I guided ended in success. In several of them, we even managed to take down minotaurs, which gave them even greater prestige.\nThis job was much easier when the rich brought well-armed escorts with them. All I had to do was stick to my routine: survey the land, recommend the best spots, and keep hidden. Then, I let the noble take all the glory while I got paid for each successful hunt. I could see the satisfaction on their faces as their egos swelled—and my coin purse did too.\nSpeaking of money, I managed to fill a medium chest with about seven hundred gold crowns. I'd earned even more than that, but I started spending nearly as fast as I earned it. A better saddle, a fine dwarven dagger, paying a professional tailor to help improve my camouflage gear, properly adjusting the cloth for my horse… And, well, I finally bought that dwarven arquebus I had my eye on. But when I practiced firing it for the first time, I nearly went deaf.\nClearly, that thing was probably the number one cause of ruined eardrums. Using it required at least some kind of hearing protection. And well, if your ears are blocked, you can't hear orders. So the poor bastards who have to use those things probably go deaf within a few months, if they're lucky.\nDespite the pain, the arquebus had its appeal. The accuracy was impressive, but the vibration and blast were a curse. There was no way to use it effectively in the middle of combat unless you were ready for the side effects.\nThe hunt continued, and while the nobles enjoyed their luxurious banquets, I stayed away from those feasts. I couldn't join in the grand celebrations, but that didn't mean I couldn't eat well. The cooks working for the nobles, although focused on preparing the finest dishes for them, also sold leftovers to those who could afford them—people like me, still in the camp. So, I went to them and bought some decent food. It wasn't as refined as what they served at the banquets, but it was still tasty… if you could detect any flavor under the explosion of spices covering everything.\nI tried pigeon stuffed with mushrooms, drenched in garlic butter. The meat was juicy, and the garlic gave it a deep, satisfying flavor that I enjoyed. There was also Reik river fish soup, thick and seasoned with pepper. The taste was intense, and while I wasn't fond of excessive spices, it was still edible. One of the most common dishes was venison and boar marinated in mushroom sauce and salt, then roasted and coated in a layer of spices that formed a black crust. It was flavorful, but the sheer amount of seasoning ruined the true taste of the meat, which could've been much more enjoyable if not drowned in condiments.\nEven if it wasn't what I had hoped for, I spent a good portion of my earnings on that food. I didn't want to go back to eating potatoes, carrots, and banquet scraps. At least during those days, I ate well—and so did my mare, who, with all the constant exercise, needed to be fed carrots, apples, and wheat grain regularly to stay in shape for the outings.\nHowever, when we returned to Helmgart, I couldn't help but feel a bit of sorrow at having to go back to servant work, obeying orders after having enjoyed so much freedom… especially knowing I had a decent stash of gold saved up.\nJoachim was a man of his word, at least in that regard. I never had to clean the latrines again, nor shovel horse shit. But many of my duties were replaced with simpler tasks, like frequently serving wine or carrying the standard when the Margrave administered justice in the city. Life, although calmer, became more rigid and at times monotonous. Still, I'd earned a bit of respect—and some freedom—in the process.\nDuring training, I stood out more and more, since I didn't have to waste energy on hours of hard labor moving things or cleaning filth. Despite the long hours standing next to the Margrave's family, I always showed up full of energy. And as expected, I regularly wiped the floor with both the old and new pages who had arrived. I used the fear they had of me, taking full advantage of my greater height compared to the rest. That edge gave me a dominant position, and I didn't hesitate to use it, being rough when necessary.\nAnother duty that changed was that I was now allowed to attend the private balls held at the fortress—though only as a cupbearer. I didn't participate in the dancing or conversations, but my presence was essential, serving a horde of nobles who drank wine as if tomorrow didn't exist. I could hear all kinds of nonsense, from comments about how ridiculous a piece of clothing looked to darker, subtler talk—like when someone mentioned emptying a vial into another's cup and waiting to see what happened. I also noticed how certain one-night hunters moved between the circles, looking for new prey or boasting shamelessly about past conquests.\nOne evening, while I was acting as cupbearer at the family dinner, serving the noble members of the fortress lord's kin, one of the Margrave's brothers was chewing a piece of meat noisily. \"You know… Reinhardt, I spoke with the captain of the border guard today, and he told me…\" He took a sip of wine, not losing his composure. \"He said there was a skirmish with the Bretonnians… we lost twelve men and have no idea how many we killed,\" he said, wiping his mouth with a napkin. \"More wine,\" he added, showing little concern for the matter.\nI walked slowly over to him, bowed slightly, and refilled his cup, hoping what followed would be more sensible. The Margrave waited in silence until I had poured the wine for his brother before speaking.\n\"Oh… just like that, business as usual. By Sigmar, you bastard, at least stop stuffing your face while delivering this kind of news! How long ago was the skirmish… and why haven't I been informed yet?\" the Margrave snapped, slamming his fist on the table, causing the cups to rattle.\nHis brother, with little more than a shrug, seemed indifferent to the reaction. \"Last night. One of the patrols guarding the border was chasing a group of bandits operating in the area and got attacked by a group of Bretonnian knights and their men-at-arms. A handful of survivors made it back after the fight. So, what do you plan to do?\" he asked.\n\"We're going to punish those bastards where it hurts. We'll strike hard, then ask for a conversation with the Duke of Montfort. But first, we'll put a few of his knights to the sword,\" said the Margrave, his voice colder and harder than I'd ever heard it before.\nThe room remained tense as the meal continued, the Margrave with clenched fists, visibly furious at the news. The atmosphere in the hall shifted.\nHe tried to return to eating, but eventually set his utensils down and stood up with an impatient gesture. \"Cupbearer, with me. I'm going to need a lot to drink,\" he said, still visibly seething.\nI followed him, carrying the wine jug in my hands. Through the winding hallways of the fortress, I accompanied him in silence, listening to him curse the Bretonnians over and over. Every word out of his mouth was soaked in fury, and it was clear the recent skirmish had shaken him more than he was willing to admit.\nWe arrived at a chamber filled with maps, and the Margrave placed his cup on a table. He signaled for me to serve him.\nAs I poured, he began to sift through map after map, looking for the right one. It seemed he was scanning for places where Bretonnians had camps—abandoned or possibly taken over by orcs. Every location he pointed at became a marked target for vengeance, and his eyes gleamed with the thirst for retribution.\n\"Albrecht… want to take part?\" the Margrave asked, turning to me after deciding where to strike.\n\"If you'll allow me, I've got a few toys I want to try out—courtesy of our friend from the mountains,\" I said as I refilled his cup.\n\"I was planning to wait until you turned eleven, but to hell with formality. Fine. From now on, you're a squire. I'll be sending some of my knights there. Your job will be to serve them and help with their armor, horses, weapons, and food. And if you behave yourself, you might get close enough to observe—or even try out that dwarven gun you bought. With luck, you'll drop one of those dogs,\" said the Margrave, taking the jug from my hands and signaling me to leave.\nI left the chamber rather pleased, knowing I'd get to leave the fortress once more. Polishing armor, making sure swords were properly oiled—it was far better than spending the whole day watching nobles play their little social games while I served as a glorified wine boy.\nThat night, I prepared all the gear I'd need for the hunt. Winter was approaching fast, and I knew my old camouflage wouldn't be worth much. I'd have to make a new one, which meant looking for fresh pigments—a headache, for sure. But what I did have for certain was my dwarven spear and arquebus, along with the black powder vials I'd acquired, which could prove useful in the hunt. With any luck, I'd bring something down.\nIn the months following the big hunt, I managed—using beeswax and some cloth—to craft a type of earplug. It would probably let me fire the arquebus without going deaf. Definitely a meaningful improvement, even if I wasn't sure it would work perfectly.",

      "content": "I would appreciate it if you could post reviews about what you think of the story so far.\n-------------------------------\nThe next day, I was woken up by a servant who led me to the training yard. There, the host that was to march into Bretonnian territory was assembling. Before me stood the best troops Helmgart could offer: swordsmen, halberdiers, crossbowmen, and a group of men whose clothes were lined with an impressive number of pistols. A small but imposing group of knights were also suiting up, mounting enormous warhorses clad in barding, their riders fully armored in the finest plate available in this part of the Empire.\nThis was serious business.\nI immediately spotted my group—the squires. Most were boys between fourteen and twenty, serving their knights with everything they had. They were responsible for every duty except fighting. Our job was to maintain their weapons and armor, make sure everything was in order before every engagement, and be ready to serve at a moment's notice.\nStill, beyond those routine tasks, there was one specific duty we were expected to perform in battle. If we saw our knight fall—wounded or dead—our only mission was to recover his body, no matter the cost or the place. We had to do it at all costs, not just to save his life, but to preserve his honor—and ours.\nI passed unnoticed, despite being four years younger than the minimum age to be a squire. Thanks to my height and build, inherited from my father, I probably looked like a slightly more slim squire than the rest, but not enough for anyone to suspect the Margrave had completely disregarded tradition.\nThey gave me a chainmail shirt—fifteen kilos of pure labor from a blacksmith who had joined rings day and night for who knows how long.\n\"Damn, this one's high-quality,\" I muttered as I put it on. It even had a mail coif with a leather front to protect my face, covering my mouth and nose to prevent chafing. I adjusted the sleeves and hem; the hauberk reached all the way to my ankles. I was completely wrapped in steel.\n\"Yeah, but it's useless against a hammer. Put on the helmet and make sure the strap's tight,\" said someone behind me, handing me a nasal helmet before vanishing.\nBefore donning the helmet, I put on a tabard with the Margrave's heraldry, covering most of the mail. Then came padded trousers in matching colors. I tightened my belt and strapped on my dagger and some basic tools that might come in handy on the road.\nI put on the nasal helmet and fastened the strap tight, securing it to my skull. I didn't have a mirror—or rather, I doubted they even existed—but I must have looked well-armed to any peasant we came across.\nThe weight difference was noticeable, but nothing I couldn't get used to. Spread out across my body, the weight was easier to carry than if it were on my back. But now came the job of moving the gear to the wagons.\nSo, for several minutes, I hauled equipment—tents, tools, crossbow bolts, pistol rounds, gunpowder—and made damn sure none of it got wet, because if it did, it would be useless. And may Sigmar have mercy on your soul if that happened in battle.\nOnce everything was ready, we left the fortress and headed toward Bretonnia. As expected, the pass that protected Helmgart was narrow, barely more than a single road flanked by mountains. Along the way were plenty of taverns, thanks to the steady trade between the Empire and Bretonnia.\nMore than once we passed returning Imperial caravans, hauling back the profits of trade with the Bretonnians—loads of raw materials or crafted goods. Even though Bretonnia lacks much industry, what they brought back were either raw resources or blacksmith products needed to keep both economies moving.\nThe trip lasted nearly all day, until finally, as evening fell, we found ourselves in Bretonnian territory, under the supposed protection of their knights. But since night was approaching, we made camp.\nI went back to doing the usual duties from the hunting trips: pitching the tent, preparing food for the knight I was assigned to, helping him remove his armor, and performing maintenance. I spent a good while polishing and oiling his sword to make sure it was ready for the next day. I also fed his horse, removed the saddle, and ensured everything was in order.\nThe night passed quietly—guards had been assigned, so we could sleep without worry. Sometimes we heard the harsh mountain winds, but nothing disturbed the silence of the night.\nBy morning, just before sunrise, scouts were sent out to check whether the Bretonnian border watch camps were nearby. Meanwhile, I was once again tasked with cooking, helping the knight with his armor, and preparing his horse.\nWhile we ate, the scouts returned with news. They'd seen white smoke on the horizon, revealing the Bretonnians' position. The men who had stood guard through the night were ordered to rest, and new ones were assigned to defend the camp. Without wasting time, we prepared to move out toward the detected Bretonnian encampment.\nWe marched as quickly as the rocky terrain allowed. The rough ground began to wear down our horses, unused to such a difficult path. At one point, we had to climb a steep hill to get closer to the Bretonnian camp.\nAfter several minutes of marching, we began to see the white smoke the scouts had mentioned, rising into the air. Without delay, we descended the hill, approaching the smoke that came from the Bretonnians' campfires. The closer we got, the clearer the shape of a fortified camp became, surrounded by wooden palisades.\nThe leader of the group, one of the Margrave's knights, gave the order to attack, and without delay, we all moved into position. The Bretonnians, caught off guard by the speed of our arrival, began to sound the alarm, but it was already too late. Our knights charged with ferocity, galloping straight toward the palisade gate, which seemed to be the weakest point.\nWhile the Bretonnians tried to close the gate, our assault was unleashed. The knights stormed through like a tempest, and the first shots rang out at our side. I saw several Bretonnians fall dead from atop the palisade, shot down by soldiers already closing in on the fortification with firearms.\nWith the gate broken, the rest of the force violently stormed into the Bretonnian camp. The shouts of the men-at-arms echoed as they tried to regroup, but it was far too late. We had struck with the speed of lightning, and now we were inside, ready to carry out the orders given.\nChaos reigned inside the camp. The Bretonnians had been completely caught off guard. Many weren't even armed when the attack began, and confusion spread everywhere. Some of their knights tried to fight back but were quickly made prime targets for the flintlock pistols of the Margrave's men. Gunfire thundered through the air, and I saw them collapse, their armor crushed and warped by the force of the shots. They couldn't even react before being taken down.\nAs we pushed forward, the bodies of the dead began to pile up, most of them Bretonnian. Aside from being unprepared, many lacked proper equipment. They were poorly armed compared to the Margrave's state troops and his private soldiers, and that made all the difference. Most of the Bretonnians fell quickly, without a chance to defend themselves properly.\nThough everything around me was a whirlwind of chaos, screams, and the noise of battle, my focus shifted constantly between threats and the knight I served. If he fell, my sole mission was to retrieve his body from the battlefield, no matter the cost.\nAs the fight continued, the Bretonnians tried desperately to hold their camp, but the advantage was clearly ours. Our men pressed forward without pause, and the remaining Bretonnians looked more and more desperate with each passing moment.\nWe squires remained on the sidelines, watching, staying out of the worst of the fighting. Gradually, the sounds of battle began to die down, until finally, the clash of weapons faded. The knights were already chasing down those fleeing on foot, and the rest were either dead or captured.\nAs soon as the fighting ended, the soldiers began looting the camp without hesitation. They looked for anything of value among the Bretonnians' belongings. In fact, a fight broke out over one of the dead knights. But I was mistaken—it wasn't about the armor. They were arguing over the right to claim the body.\nI heard some of the men shouting angrily over who had the right to ransom the corpse. Some boasted of having landed the killing blow and claimed that gave them ownership, so they could collect a ransom from the family.\nThe fastest ones, however, wasted no time in seizing the Bretonnian warhorses. These animals, considered far superior to Imperial horses, were almost sacred in Bretonnian culture, tied to the very honor of their knights. Bretonnian warhorses had a reputation that made them extremely valuable. If the Margrave only wanted to return the slap he'd received, he could send them back to their rightful owners, keeping things within a manageable border dispute.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nBut if he truly wished to escalate the conflict, simply keeping the horses would be a provocation serious enough to enrage every Bretonnian knight. The level of honor they placed on their steeds was such that losing them could be considered a greater insult than death itself.\nI felt tempted to offer gold to those who had captured the horses. If the Margrave decided to keep them, I could send them to my father, who would use them to improve future generations of warhorses. But if he returned them, they'd just say it had to be done, and everything invested would be lost. There was something tempting about securing those horses, though I knew the Margrave would make his own decision, as he always did.\n\"What are you staring at, Imperial coward?\" said one of the captured Bretonnians as he watched the horses.\nI turned toward him, and to my surprise, I understood his French—well enough to catch the contempt in his words. I chose to ignore him. No one truly important was left. The only ones who mattered were the dead knights. The rest—men-at-arms and peasant squires—were just border guards holding off their own kind of danger.\nEventually, the knights returned, and thankfully, mine returned as well.\n\"No survivors... We must keep marching. We need to destroy as many Bretonnian camps as we can before they send a force after us,\" said the leader of the punitive expedition, his voice heavy and resolute.\nAt those words, all the soldiers drew their weapons again and began executing the prisoners without mercy. The sound of steel cutting through flesh echoed in the air as the Bretonnians dropped one by one, their lives snuffed out.\nMy knight approached me and handed me a dagger, his expression cold and distant.\n\"Take this chance. You'll never have it easier to kill a man,\" he said, pointing at the Bretonnian still kneeling before me, awaiting his fate.\nI took the dagger firmly, looking at the prisoner. I moved his left arm aside, and with a swift, decisive motion, drove the blade straight into his heart, slipping it between the ribs in a clean strike that pierced the organ directly without the bones getting in the way.\nHis eyes widened in shock as the blade sank in, but no words came out. The pain was so immediate that he didn't even have time to react. I pulled the dagger out, and a pool of blood quickly formed around his lifeless body.\n\"Done,\" I said, handing the dagger back to my knight, who simply nodded.\nHe took the blade again and watched as the rest of the prisoners were executed without a shred of compassion.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I pulled the trigger on the arquebus, feeling the weapon's kick against my hand as it fired.\nThere was a jolt, but the sound faded quickly—my ears were completely blocked with the improvised plugs I'd made. For a moment, I was blind, wrapped in a thick white smoke that slowly cleared around me. I spent a few seconds trying to wave it away.\n\"Ugh, I missed!\" I muttered in frustration, watching the Bretonnian archer sprint back toward his comrades, likely to warn them of the incoming attack.\"How did I miss that? Damn it...!\" I kept grumbling while watching him vanish down the road, powerless to stop him. \"Out of nearly twenty shots, I've only landed two? Dwarven quality, my ass...\" I cursed under my breath, starting to reload the arquebus with quick, practiced movements, frustration buzzing through me.\nThe process was repetitive, but necessary. Powder—laid in carefully. Ball—placed with precision. Finally, the match—secured and ready.\nThe last week had been insane. We'd managed to hit three Bretonnian camps before they even realized the Margrave had sent retaliation for the raid. When the Duke of Montfort found out he'd lost about five hundred men and several knights in a swift strike, he wasted no time sending a large force of knights and men-at-arms.\nSince then, we'd been stationed in the first Bretonnian camp we attacked. After clearing out the corpses and shoveling the dirt to remove the stench of death, we fortified the place. We knew we weren't alone in Bretonnian territory—a still-unknown force was lurking, trying to drive us out.\nHard to tell if this was escalating or cooling down. Trade between the two realms was still going, but it was harder now to assist merchants if bandits or greenskins struck. Daily skirmishes between Imperial and Bretonnian troops kept the tension high.\nThe fights were quick. A few soldiers clashing with another group during patrols. We'd taken some losses, but the Bretonnians had lost far more.\nThe state pistolier regiment, apparently, was very good at these engagements. They always carried multiple pistols, which allowed them to drop several threats quickly. Not long ago, I saw one of them shoot down four Bretonnian men-at-arms without much trouble. The speed and chaos of the shots made them terrifying. Even if the pistols weren't the most accurate, firing at close range left little room for defense.\nWhat baffled me was the confidence of the Bretonnians. I couldn't understand where they got the idea that a sword gave them any kind of edge against a firearm. Even if the pistol's accuracy was poor, at close range there wasn't much a swordsman could do but die. They didn't seem to realize how big the gap was—and that made them all the more vulnerable.\nNot long ago, my main job had been tending to my knight's armor, making sure it was always in top condition. I had to clean off the blood, repair the sword, and sometimes bring it to the camp blacksmith to get it sharpened. It wasn't easy. I had to constantly pressure the smith to keep the edge perfect. It was one of those routine tasks that I thought would never be an issue… but they ended up taking most of my time.\nSomething I never imagined I'd have to do was fight other squires for supplies. Even though the right amount always arrived, a few bastards made sure to hoard more than their share, leaving the rest of us short. Horseshoes, oils, straps, cavalry lances... everything started becoming scarce because of those bastards. So, it wasn't rare for me to \"adjust someone's teeth\" a few times, making it clear I wasn't going to let them screw us over.\nDespite the problems, my work had been decent. Still, there were times when I failed to notice dents or strikes on the armor, which meant I didn't repair it before the next fight. That earned me a few beatings with a stick, but nothing I couldn't handle.\nAll of this earned me permission to join the patrols. And even though my main job was still to serve and maintain, I took the chance to test my dwarven arquebus. But I quickly realized it came with serious problems. My own size was a problem—the weapon was big, heavy, and the recoil was nasty. Its effective range wasn't great, barely 150 meters, so I had to get close to the enemy.\nThe real issue was that between the smoke and the sound of the shot, I was instantly spotted. No matter how accurate I was, what truly put me at risk was the attention it drew. Once I fired, I had to run like hell to avoid getting skewered by some Bretonnian knight. They didn't mess around—one mistake, and you'd end up with a lance through the ribs.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\n\"Alright, here comes another one... the patrol coming to hunt me down,\" I muttered, aiming again, focused on the figure taking shape on the horizon. I called my horse to be ready and quickly prepared my arquebus. But when I saw the Grail heraldry on the approaching knight, my blood ran cold.\n\"A bloody Grail Knight!\" I shouted, panicked, as I saw his sword glowing with an almost mystical light. He was one of them, clad in radiant armor, wielding a blade that looked like it was forged from sunlight itself.\nI saw his helmet turn, his eyes locked on me through the slits in his visor. Fear shot through me, but I didn't waste a second. I wasn't about to sit there waiting for some glorious death. I jumped onto my horse and kicked its flank, forcing it into a gallop.\nThe sound of hooves behind me made my heart sink, but the noise quickly began to fade, and the pressure on my chest slowly lifted. I didn't know if he was really chasing me or if I was just imagining it in the heat of the moment, but my mind was racing just as fast as my horse.\nAs the distance grew, the sound of his horse vanished completely, but the echo of my pounding heart kept ringing in my ears. The adrenaline shot through every fiber of me, and I couldn't shake the image of that glowing knight.\nI reached the camp at full gallop, pushing the horse to its limit, barely managing to stop in time. I was gasping for air, too afraid to look behind me, though I kept glancing around, paranoid someone was following. My blood was still pumping hard\nI made straight for the expedition commander's tent, wasting no time. Even the guards stationed at the entrance couldn't stop me. I barged in, cutting through whatever discussion they were having—everyone turned to look at me.\n\"Albrecht… I hope this is—\" the commander began, but I cut him off before he could finish.\n\"There's a bloody Grail Knight out there!\" I shouted, pointing in the direction I had seen him.\nThe commander's eyes widened, staring at me like he couldn't believe what he'd just heard.\"What do you mean… that can't be… this is bad. Are you sure it was a Grail Knight?\" he asked, his disbelief thick in his voice.\n\"Of course I'm sure! Huge horse, huge rider, glowing weapon, and several Grails on his crest and armor. If that wasn't a Grail Knight, then I don't know what is,\" I said firmly, still seeing the glowing figure in my mind.\n\"This is serious… maybe we should retreat,\" one of the knights muttered, clearly worried.\n\"My lord! Bretonnian forces are approaching!\" someone shouted as they rushed into the tent.\n\"Shit!\" the commander swore, his face hardening at once. \"Too late! Prepare for battle! Sigmar will be proud when we drive back these horse-loving bastards,\" he said, giving the order.\nI ran toward the wooden walls, my heart pounding. From up there, I could see a large number of Bretonnians forming ranks, preparing for the assault.\n\"Shit, they've got a battering ram! That gate's not going to hold long!\" I said, bracing myself for what was coming as the weight of the situation started to hit me. The battle was about to begin, and there was no turning back.\nI went to where my knight was, ready to help in any way I could before the Bretonnians charged, but he ordered me to assist on the walls with my arquebus. The more guns on the walls, the better. I didn't hesitate.\nThe sound of war drums and Bretonnian shouts was getting closer—every second counted. I loaded my arquebus, made sure it was charged and ready, and took my position.\nThe Bretonnian drums thundered as waves of infantry moved toward the walls. Most were men-at-arms, but there was also a large group of poorly armed peasants dragging axes and pitchforks.\nI aimed at the mass of enemy troops. First, I made sure to put in my earplugs—without them, the blast would leave me half deaf. I aimed carefully, pulled the trigger, and felt the kick, but held steady. After firing, I ducked behind cover and began to reload. While doing so, I watched the other Imperial soldiers—reloading crossbows and pistols, firing nonstop into the Bretonnian lines, unleashing a storm of projectiles that tore into them.\nAs expected, it didn't take long for the battering ram to reach the wooden gate. They started pounding on it hard, trying to break through. I didn't hesitate—I fired again. I blew the face off one of the ram operators, but he was quickly replaced. Even with all the gunners targeting the ram, the gate began to crack under the relentless blows.\nAfter a few more hits, the gate finally gave way—but the Bretonnians were met with a wall of Imperial halberdiers, bracing their weapons with unwavering resolve. The resistance was strong, but the number of attackers flooding in was overwhelming.\nAs I watched the clash unfold, I suddenly felt a sharp blow to my chest that nearly knocked the wind out of me. I looked down quickly and saw an arrow lodged in my mail. I ducked at once, heart pounding. Bretonnian archers had begun harassing our lines with a rain of arrows, and the first one had found its mark.\nThe pain was sharp, but when I saw the arrow had barely pierced my mail, I realized only the tip had gone in. The armor had stopped the worst of it, though the hit still hurt. Either way, it wasn't the time to stop.\n\"Kid, this isn't the time to cry. Keep shooting,\" said an Imperial arquebusier next to me, reloading quickly.\nI nodded without a word and got ready for my next shot.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

While they were still being held back by the halberdiers, the air was filled with gunfire and war cries.\nI quickly ducked back, took a breath, and began reloading my weapon. I watched the battle unfolding in front of me closely. There was a small pile of bodies at the center of the fight, where the Bretonnians were pushing furiously, but the halberdiers were holding the line with fierce determination.\nI reloaded fast, trying to steady my breathing so I wouldn't drop the powder vials from my hands. Peeking out again, I fired at another group of Bretonnians closing in on the camp.\nAs I reloaded again, I saw the Bretonnian forces beginning to push the halberdiers back after a brutal sacrifice. The fight was turning against our lines. Fortunately, the swordsmen regiment joined in, reinforcing the front and forming a stronger blockade to hold the Bretonnian advance.\nWe were winning the ranged exchange—Bretonnian peasant archers didn't have many arrows. It didn't take long before they ran out of ammunition, giving us more freedom to fire without the constant threat of incoming arrows.\nI reloaded and fired again, and again. The rhythm of battle was relentless: shoot, reload, shoot, reload. But then I noticed the Bretonnian forces had broken through the halberdier and swordsmen lines, pouring into the camp from multiple directions. Chaos erupted within the walls as battle lines collapsed and hand-to-hand combat spread everywhere. Our defenses were crumbling fast.\nIt didn't take long for a man-at-arms to start climbing the stairs toward me. I saw him coming quickly, eyes locked on me with his sword raised. I wasn't going to let him kill me before I got a shot off. I aimed my arquebus and fired. Through the white smoke, I saw the shot tear a bloody hole in his torso—it even struck the man behind him. The impact dropped them both instantly, their bodies tumbling down the stairs.\nSeeing this, one of the pistolers rushed forward, standing in front of me, sword in hand, firing his pistols. He moved with impressive skill, tossing empty pistols behind him and drawing others from his belt, cutting down the advancing Bretonnians with deadly efficiency.\nI kept reloading, helping as much as I could, holding my ground and firing whenever I had a shot. The rest of the regiment—crossbowmen, pistolers, and arquebusiers—were doing the same, fiercely defending the stairs and camp walls. The fighting had reached its peak. The defenses had been reduced to sheer fury and desperation.\nAt last, the greatswords entered the fray. The fighting grew even more intense as they began cutting down the Bretonnian men-at-arms and the mob of peasants behind them. They slaughtered them quickly, while we kept a large group of desperate Bretonnians at bay—thanks to the skill of some pistolers with blades and the fact that we controlled the high ground on the stairs. The battle was becoming a tide of blood and desperation.\nThe slaughter didn't stop, and the dead piled up fast on both sides due to the brutal intensity of the fight. Despite the pressure, we were pushing the Bretonnians out of the camp, step by step.\n\"No powder… you got any?\" I asked an arquebusier behind me while removing one of my earplugs.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\n\"Almost out too, kid. Check the body over there—think he had some left before the archers got him,\" he said, pointing to a nearby corpse.\nI nodded and moved fast, stepping back from the defensive line on the stairs. I searched quickly among the dead. The Imperial soldiers were too busy fighting to pay attention, and I knew this moment was critical. I rummaged through the pouches of a fallen arquebusier and luckily found a few flasks of black powder and some usable ammunition.\nWith supplies in hand, I rushed back into the fight, reloading my arquebus as fast as I could. No time to waste—I put my earplug back in, ready to shoot again.\n\"Here, in case you need it,\" I said, handing one of the flasks to the arquebusier who had helped me, then got back into position, ready to keep shooting. The battle was still merciless.\nThe fighting didn't let up. Despite casualties on both sides, we were beginning to take back control of the camp. When we finally pushed the Bretonnians off the stairs—only a couple of them were still close enough to reach me—it looked like we might have turned the tide.\nJust when we thought we had won, I noticed something on the horizon. A sizable group of Bretonnian cavalry was fast approaching, and leading them was the Grail Knight, his radiant armor shining like a beacon.\n\"Bretonnian knights! Bretonnian knights!\" I shouted, trying to warn those near the gates, my voice echoing through the chaos.\nBit by bit, the thunder of hooves rumbled through the camp. The knights came in with lances leveled, and as they got closer, their charge became an unstoppable whirlwind. They plowed through everything in their path—friend or foe—it didn't matter. The sheer force of their charge was terrifying.\nMy attention shifted to the new enemies spreading through the camp, cutting down anyone wearing the colors of the Margrave or the Empire.\nAt last, the Imperial cavalry, which until now had stayed out of the fight, joined the fray. Suddenly, dozens of Imperial knights charged into the Bretonnian knights, clashing violently with lances and swords.The impact was brutal. Two groups of knights—rivals by nature—met with the fury of their mounts and the full weight of their armor, crashing together in a storm of steel and the screech of torn metal. The camp battle turned even more chaotic.The fight between knights became a display of both skill and savagery—lances shattered, swords clashed mid-air, and clouds of dust rose with each blow. The ground was littered with bodies and cries of pain, everything centered around the knights' charge, which would determine who would take final control of the camp.\n\"Stay still, you damned son of a…!\" I snarled, squeezing the trigger of my arquebus. The shot thundered, and I saw the Bretonnian knight drop dead, a massive hole blown through his back.The recoil threw me off slightly, but I rushed to reload again—it had become second nature by now. I'd lost count of how many times I had gone through this cycle during the battle: shoot, reload, shoot, reload. The dense gunsmoke and the deafening noise of war wrapped around me, but my eyes never stopped searching for a new target.\nAs I reloaded, I scanned the battlefield. The Grail Knight—that towering figure standing out from the rest—fought with terrifying skill. He was taking on half a dozen Imperial knights at once, his sword flashing through the air as if it were an extension of his will. With every blow, he brought one of our knights down. He had already slain two. He was a machine of war, and it showed.\nBut as much as I wanted to focus on shooting the Grail Knight, the more immediate threat was the Bretonnians still climbing the stairs, trying to wipe out the last of our resistance. Every shot we fired from the walls gave them a window to advance, but we had to do everything possible to hold them off.\nI fired again, the arquebus' blast echoing around me, but while I reloaded, I saw one of the last Bretonnians rushing up the stairs. In the blink of an eye, he killed the arquebusier standing in front of me. The man didn't even have time to defend himself. My heart raced as I saw him fall, and I realized the situation was getting worse by the second. We had no more time.\nWithout powder loaded in my arquebus, my only option was to strike. I grabbed the hot barrel with both hands and slammed the stock into the Bretonnian's face as hard as I could. The impact shook through my arms, and the man cried out in pain, his face twisted from the blow.\nTaking advantage of his confusion, I shoved him with all my strength. I watched him fall from the wall, his neck snapping into an unnatural angle that sent a chill down my spine. There was no time to think about it.\nI quickly took the last bullets from the corpse of the fallen arquebusier. With shaking hands, I poured fresh powder into my weapon. The air was thick, blood covered the ground, and the noise of battle never seemed to stop.\nThe fight had become a slaughter, a brutality that left more corpses than survivors. The Bretonnians began to retreat, only a handful of knights still fighting to the bitter end. We, on the other hand, had suffered heavy losses—only a few survivors remained below, and the situation still felt desperate.\nI looked again for the Grail Knight. I found him, surrounded by the bodies of Imperial knights. His horse, dead beside him, looked like a faithful companion that had reached the same end. The knight was barely breathing, his armor crushed by repeated blows, wounds bleeding from several gashes across his body.\nAs I approached, my eyes locked onto something that became my duty. The body of my knight lay among the fallen surrounding the Grail Knight. A knot formed in my stomach as I stepped closer.\nThe Grail Knight's eyes met mine. His voice, though weak, carried exhaustion.\n\"Loyal squire… You come for your master's body, don't you?\" the Grail Knight said, trying to rise. But I saw the spear lodged in one of his thighs, and his armor was misshapen from all the hits and gunshots. He was bleeding from multiple open wounds.\nWhen he finally noticed the arquebus in my hands, he gripped his sword tighter, his face twisting with rage.\n\"A quiet plain of roses, trampled by an Imperial boot soaked in blood… a child with a coward's weapon destroying a Grail shrine… a sky full of twin-tailed comet banners above a ruined Bretonnian castle… YOU!\" he shouted, trying to stand with all his strength, voice filled with hatred.\nI said nothing. I simply pulled the trigger.The shot was clean, hitting him square in the chest. I saw him fall backward, his body hitting the ground with a dull thud. His hand still clutched his sword, and for a moment I saw him move—trying to turn and crawl toward me.\nWithout hesitation, I reloaded and fired again, this time aiming for his head. The shot echoed, and I saw his body go completely still. There was no more fight, no more effort to rise. The Grail Knight lay motionless, his sword still firmly gripped in his hand as blood spread slowly into the earth beneath him.\nThe battle ended soon after.We had won, but at a high price. Most of our men had fallen, and the battlefield was covered in corpses. I couldn't shake the feeling that this victory tasted like defeat—every step forward cost us dearly.\nI wasted no time and headed for a nearby supply cart. With great effort, I hitched it to the remaining horses. I loaded my knight's body first, making sure it was secured and protected for the journey back. Then, with exhausted strength, I lifted the Grail Knight's corpse as well. That bastard—dead or not—was worth a fortune in ransom. The Bretonnians would surely pay handsomely to recover his body.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The air was thick with the stench of death and blood. Only a few of us remained from the beginning of the day, moving among the corpses, looting what we could from the Bretonnian dead. The sounds of scavengers mixed with the groans of the wounded formed a macabre symphony that accompanied the stillness of victory.\nI, however, stepped away from the chaos. My mind focused on the task ahead. I made my way to my knight's body, the one I had to give a final honor to. I began removing his armor carefully, cleaning the wounds with a damp cloth, trying to wipe away the blood that still clung to him. There was a deep wound in his neck—caused by the Grail Knight—where the sword had pierced through the armor. It had slashed through the neck and reached the heart. It had been fatal, but still, it was my duty to clean and prepare him.\nOnce I had finished, I found some linen cloths stored nearby and began to wrap the body, covering him from the elements. I set the armor aside.\nWhen I was done, I stood and searched the ruined camp, hoping to find some sign of life, any officer still in command. The camp was a shadow of what it once had been, with the bodies of knights, captains, and sergeants scattered everywhere. Near the commander's tent, I found him crushed beneath a dead horse. My stomach clenched at the sight.\n\"Shit... who's still alive here?\" I muttered, looking around for any figure of authority, but all I saw were more corpses, more fallen men.\nI stepped into the commander's tent, but it was empty. No one was left inside. The chaos had been absolute, and the casualties seemingly total after the Bretonnian cavalry attack. It was as if everything had collapsed in a single blow.\nIn one corner of the tent, something caught my eye: a locked chest with a raven-shaped clasp—clearly a symbol of Morr. When I opened it, I found it full of iron coins, all marked with the raven.\nI picked up the chest and dragged it out of the tent.\n\"Hey! Is there any captain, lieutenant, or sergeant still alive?!\" I shouted at the top of my lungs, trying to catch the attention of those still wandering the battlefield, looking for something to stuff into their pockets.\nA man with a bloodied bandage over one eye approached. He was the captain—a rough-looking man hardened by years of battle. His stare was sharp and calculating, the kind of look worn by someone used to making difficult decisions. He glanced at me with a mix of disdain and curiosity.\"What is it, young squire?\" he asked, unaware of who I was or what my rank might be.\n\"Do you have experience with the Bretonnians? Is it likely they'll attack again?\" I asked, dropping the chest onto the ground and crossing my arms, keeping my posture firm. I knew the situation was serious and needed clear answers.\nThe captain nodded firmly. \"The Bretonnians don't attack again the same day they're beaten. Maybe the next day, maybe a few days later. But sooner or later, they will return,\" he said, his tone leaving no room for doubt.\n\"Good. That means we've got some time,\" I replied, relieved. \"We can protect the dead, perform a quick rite to Morr, and prepare to return. Order the others to gather our dead—we'll place the coins, cover them with soil, and perform the rite. With any luck, it will be enough until a proper ritual can be done.\" I pointed toward a group of fallen soldiers, hoping they'd receive the respect they deserved.\n\"Are those the commander's orders?\" the captain asked, eyeing me with suspicion, trying to gauge if my authority was legitimate.\n\"Yes, of course,\" I replied without hesitation, pointing at the commander's crushed corpse. \"Ask him if you have doubts… he's under that horse.\"\nThe captain stared at the scene in silence, then sighed. \"We should retreat. We don't have time for this,\" he said finally, in a pragmatic tone.\n\"No time for this?\" I replied coldly. \"Do you know what could happen if we don't do this properly? Necromancers, that's what. Do you know what happens when you leave the dead unblessed? Do you know what this could cost us later?\"\nThe captain straightened, his gaze hardening as he met mine. \"And who gave you the right to give me orders, squire?\" he asked, voice full of challenge.\n\"I'm a noble, son and heir of Baron von Reinsfield. That gives me every right to command men like you, peasant,\" I answered calmly but firmly. \"If you have doubts, go ask the dead—or the commander. But right now, this is what needs to be done.\" I drew one of the pistols I had taken from the fallen and aimed it at him, steady. \"You know what happens to those who disobey a noble, don't you?\"\nThe captain stepped back, a flicker of hesitation in his eyes. He didn't reply. His once-steely gaze now showed a hint of doubt, though he was too proud to show fear.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\n\"Don't even think about doing something stupid,\" I continued, keeping the pistol aimed at him. \"I'm the only one who can explain what happened here to the Margrave without losing his head. If you tell him the Bretonnians nearly wiped us out, he'll think you deserted. So you'd better be smart about this. You guard me like I'm a relic. Understood?\"\nThe captain finally nodded, realizing he wasn't in a position to defy me. His expression changed.\n\"I understand, squire,\" he murmured, his voice low, and took a step back, careful not to make any move that could be seen as a challenge.\n\"Good,\" I replied, holstering the pistol. \"Now make sure everyone else follows the same orders. We're not out of danger yet.\"\nThe captain began giving orders, and most of the men, though they obeyed, did so reluctantly. Some genuinely cared about the burial rite, but many just wanted to finish quickly, not understanding the true importance of what we were doing.\nI stayed quiet as the bodies of the Margrave's soldiers and the men from Reikland were laid out in rows, their colors still visible in the camp's desolate remains. The corpses, some mutilated and others nearly unrecognizable from the battle, had to be treated with proper respect.\nAs the bodies began to be piled up, I walked to each of them, slowly closing their eyelids and placing the coins of Morr over them. Tradition taught me that only Morr could guide their souls to eternal rest, and it was my duty to fulfill that rite, even if most of the men seemed indifferent to it.\nThe ceremony was long, and although the men hurried to get it over with, I took my time. I gave each fallen soldier the respect they deserved. After an hour of work, we covered the dead with a light layer of earth. I made sure to bury a bit deeper those who had protected me during the battle—those who were the first to fall defending the walls. It was the only way I could thank them in that moment.\nWith everything I could do finally done, I stepped away from the pile of bodies and, with my head bowed, brought my hands together in a sign of respect. I recited the words I remembered from the prayers of the priest of Morr in my father's village—the ritual had to be fulfilled:\n\"By the hand of Morr, let these souls be freed. May their journey to the silent realm be swift and their peace eternal. Morr, guard these vessels from taint. Let no foul craft unbind their spirits or bodies. By Morr's sacred breath, let no unholy hand defile this ground or raise the fallen.\"\nI finished the prayer and turned toward the men.\n\"Alright, help me recover the bodies of the nobles, and let's get out of here. Load the corpses onto the supply wagons. We don't need to take everything with us. Secure the most valuable belongings, because if we want to make it back alive, we need to travel light,\" I said firmly, making sure everyone understood the urgency.\nThe men, though visibly exhausted and eager to leave, eventually began to move, helping me load the knights, still in armor, onto the wagons. While they did that, I took care of removing the armor from the fallen knights, storing it carefully with a note of their name and physical description. I cleaned their bodies and wrapped them in linen, stacking them one over the other.\nThe soldiers, knowing we would depart soon, began looting quickly, searching the Bretonnians' pockets for anything of value.\nAs soon as I finished with the bodies of the knights and the commander, we gathered all the wagons, harnessed the horses, and began our return journey to Helmgart. We marched under forced pace, moving as fast as we could.\nThe Bretonnians were likely chasing us like rabid dogs. We had the body of a Grail Knight with us, and that alone would surely have them on our trail. Without a doubt, we didn't have the numbers to survive an open battle.\nSo we used every advantage we could. We avoided traveling near any areas where patrols might be. A single mistake could cost us our lives, and we couldn't afford to lose a single man more.\nDuring those two terrible days, we marched without rest, pushing the horses to their limit. The wagons, filled with the bodies and armor of the fallen nobles, left little room for the soldiers to rest. Only two wagons were available for those who needed to lie down, and from time to time, I had to threaten any soldier who suggested leaving the nobles' bodies behind to move faster. The response was always the same: I could not allow those bodies to be dishonored, and each time someone proposed such madness, I made it clear that the consequences would be severe.\nThe Bretonnians didn't leave us alone. Throughout our march, young horsemen charged at us, trying to retrieve the Grail Knight's body, clearly knowing we had it. They offered us safe passage if we returned the corpse.\nBut my answer was always the same—I shot them in the chest and watched their companions, enraged, draw their swords and charge, only to fall quickly before our superior fire discipline. We were demoralized and exhausted, but our volleys were still deadly.\nWhat worried me the most, however, was that we were nearly out of powder. If we ran out, we'd be at the mercy of the Bretonnian knights.\nAt last, after what felt like an eternity, we spotted Imperial banners in the distance. The garrison guarding the border approached and escorted us to the camp they had established. It was an immense relief—finally, we could rest a little and stop worrying about the constant Bretonnian attacks. We informed the commander of the garrison about everything that had happened, and although he doubted us at first, when I showed him the body of the Grail Knight, his expression changed immediately. Bretonnian presence increased noticeably, and soon more knights arrived, patrolling the area as the garrison struggled to maintain control of the border.\nEventually, we resumed our return to Helmgart with some sense of calm. The Bretonnians, now focused on the multiple Imperial garrisons, could no longer concentrate on us.\nAll I wanted at that moment was to reach Helmgart and get some sleep. The fatigue was consuming me, and the stress of guarding the foul-smelling corpses of the fallen nobles was affecting me more than I cared to admit. The constant watchfulness, the fear of being ambushed by the Bretonnians, and the burden of responsibility to carry those bodies with me were wearing me down. But the most disturbing thing of all was the strange body of the Grail Knight.\nThough he had died in battle, his body showed no signs of decomposition like the others. No matter how many hours passed, there were no visible signs of decay—and that unsettled me deeply. Every time I looked at his linen-covered form, I felt as though I were staring at someone still alive, as if a part of him was still waiting to wake up.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I knew a long day still awaited us… a very long day. The tension from the mission, the paranoia about the Bretonnians, and the constant concern for the bodies we were carrying had drained me more than I wanted to admit. But just being back in Helmgart, surrounded by the fortress's safety, gave me a moment of peace.\nThe guards let us through without much trouble, perhaps thinking we were just a returning patrol or something of the sort—not a force crawling back from a failed mission, barely holding together. We didn't have time to waste. We began the steep ascent toward Helmgart's keep.\n\"Who goes there?\" shouted one of the guards at the fortress gate, watching us.\n\"Albrecht von Reinsfield, squire in service to the Margrave von Mackensen,\" I called back, though my voice held none of the strength it had when we left the camp.\n\"You weren't supposed to be out in Bretonnian territory—we received no orders about it,\" the guard shouted again, his tone clearly suspicious.\n\"The Bretonnians threw everything at us—knights, men-at-arms, even peasants. What you see here is all that remains,\" I replied bluntly, knowing there was no need to hide the truth.\nI couldn't see his face clearly, but I could tell he began giving orders, probably doubting what I had just told him. The gate began to creak open.\n\"You may enter. The Margrave will want to hear what happened,\" the guard finally said, and the doors opened wide.\nAs we entered, chaos quickly erupted around us. The noble families under the Margrave's protection, who resided in the keep, came rushing in, weeping for their dead and demanding the return of their loved ones' bodies and armor. The sound of their sobs and cries filled the air as some of the nobles approached, hoping to find their kin—or at least something belonging to them.\nLuckily, I had taken the time to mark the bodies, listing their features and names where possible. Most recognized the faces of the fallen and carried them off to perform proper funeral rites, thanking me for bringing them home.\nEventually, the knights arrived.\n\"Albrecht von Reinsfield. The Margrave wishes to speak with you,\" said one knight, pointing the way.\n\"Hey… that one's mine. No one touches his body, armor, or sword,\" I said, turning to look at the captain standing like a statue and pointing to the body of the Grail Knight.\nI began following the knight, the metallic clink of his armor echoing through the familiar halls of the fortress. The familiarity brought a brief comfort, though it vanished quickly as the weight of the situation returned. At last, we reached the chamber where the Margrave usually spent his hours reviewing maps and plans. His son Joachim, his brother, and several knights were already seated at the table. The Margrave had his hands over his face, visibly overwhelmed and unwilling to believe what had happened.\n\"Albrecht… sit,\" the Margrave said, barely containing his anger, motioning to a chair.\nI sat in silence, waiting for him to begin. I knew the consequences of our mission wouldn't be easy to explain.\n\"What the hell happened? Why is everyone dead?\" the Margrave asked through clenched teeth, his frustration palpable.\n\"We were attacked,\" I replied, staring him straight in the eyes, trying to stay calm.\n\"I know that already, damn it—but why did everyone die? What happened?\" he pressed, making those around him visibly nervous.\n\"For a time, everything was fine. We burned three Bretonnian camps, killed everyone inside, captured several horses and noble armor. But just when things seemed calm… a Grail Knight appeared,\" I said, recalling the events.\n\"You've got to be joking,\" muttered the Margrave's brother, covering his face with one hand in disbelief.\nThe Margrave stared at me intensely, and the fury in his eyes began to fade, replaced by suspicion. \"And how exactly did you survive, Albrecht?\" he asked, practically overflowing with disbelief.\n\"Because we won the battle,\" I said firmly. \"Almost all the soldiers died. We were left with no officers, but we still managed to drive the Bretonnians back. Especially after I put a chunk of lead in that Grail Knight's chest—and face. The bastard was tough. Killed eight knights by himself.\"\n\"You… you killed a Grail Knight?\" The Margrave's eyes widened in disbelief. His face was a mixture of awe and shock.\n\"Of course I did,\" I replied without hesitation. \"His body is outside. Do you really think that monster would've let us leave if he were still alive? No chance. Thanks to that, we managed to perform a quick rite for the dead and fled as fast as we could…\" I tried to keep speaking, but the Margrave was already barking orders.\n\"Bring me the body! I want to see it with my own eyes! Ha! Ha! Ha! I'll have the Duke of Montfort on his knees begging for that corpse back… By Sigmar, finally some good news!\" The Margrave laughed, and his grin lit up the whole chamber. \"So? How many Bretonnians did you kill in the battle?\"\n\"Sigmar as my witness—I've no idea,\" I answered truthfully. \"There were too many. They outnumbered us easily. I personally fired my arquebus more than forty times, so I'd guess a lot more than that… At least I brought back the bodies of the fallen nobles.\"\n\"Really? Well done, Albrecht…\" The Margrave was still smiling, clearly pleased. \"I suppose we'll have to send a priest of Morr to sanctify the battlefield… He'll be thankful you showed such concern for the dead. Don't worry, I'll make sure the families reward you properly for your actions today…\"\nThe Margrave looked quite pleased at first, but suddenly his expression changed—his face shifted from euphoria to visible anger. His eyes narrowed as he scratched his head, like he was trying to make sense of it all.\n\"And how the hell am I supposed to explain this to the Emperor?\" he said with clear frustration, staring at the floor like it was an unsolvable puzzle.\n\"As for the soldiers, we can report a series of skirmishes and…\" began the Margrave's brother, trying to find a quick way out.\n\"Not that, idiot… that's the least of our problems. We'll just recruit more from the local towns and refill the ranks. That's easy,\" the Margrave snapped, clearly irritated, then let out a heavy sigh. \"I mean Albrecht… he shouldn't even be a squire. And here he is… killed who knows how many Bretonnians, slew a Grail Knight… and brought back the bodies of the nobles. Every single act qualifies as major chivalry.\"\nHis voice trailed off, the weight of what he was saying visibly overwhelming him. The room went silent for a moment, everyone staring at the Margrave, waiting for some sort of solution.\n\"But…\" Joachim began, his tone hesitant, \"you… should knight him, father.\"\nThe Margrave sighed again, his face still twisted in frustration. \"Normally that would be the right thing to do… even for far less. But I can't just knight a ten-year-old squire. What the hell am I going to tell the other nobles? It'll look like I made all of this up,\" he said with a mix of anger and resignation.\n\"Speaking of which… I have no idea how ransom works—can I keep the knight's sword?\" I asked the Margrave.\n\"No,\" said the Margrave immediately, his tone firm. \"The Bretonnians always demand the full package: body, armor, sword, and horse when they ask for ransom. They don't accept partial returns—especially in this case. A Grail Knight is… I think they're religious figures or something. This is more of a political victory than anything else. The Duke of Montfort and the neighboring dukes will have to come negotiate for the body of the Grail Knight. That's when we squeeze them—but not too much. Push them too far, and they'll go to war just to recover the body if they think we're desecrating it. So the answer to your question is no,\" he said, shutting down my attempt to keep a piece of loot.\n\"Damn it… just when I thought I'd get to keep a sword that cuts through steel,\" I muttered, annoyed.\n\"Believe me, it's much better than having Bretonnian knights chasing you down for what you did,\" replied the Margrave with a barely perceptible smile. \"I'll see what I can do now. I'll consult with the Emperor and figure out how to handle this. Like I said, knighthood is nearly impossible. Maybe they'll take an interest and offer you a post in the Reiksguard.\"\n\"Well, if you say so, Margrave, I won't argue. You're the one with experience here… anyway, how much is my father getting from the Grail Knight ransom?\" I asked, trying to cut the interrogation short and change the topic.\n\"I'll only charge you for acting as diplomat,\" the Margrave replied in a lighter tone. \"I'm going to get a good chunk from the Duke of Montfort and send it to your father accordingly—and of course, with my thanks for this opportunity. I assume you're tired, so… someone take him to one of the guest rooms to rest.\"\n\"Thanks… and maybe give something to the soldiers who helped me carry the bodies back, because… it wasn't easy convincing them to cooperate,\" I said before turning toward the door.\n\"It shall be done,\" the Margrave nodded. As I stepped out of the chamber, I saw the Margrave hurrying toward the courtyard, eager to see the body of the Grail Knight for himself.\nI followed the knight, and to my fortune, I didn't have to sleep in my usual room. Instead, I was given a large chamber—unworthy of a noble, perhaps—but clearly built to be comfortable.Google seaʀᴄh No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nI slept like the damned. No one woke me, so I must have slept off all the exhaustion from those grueling days of marching. The fatigue had completely overtaken me, and my body had finally found the rest it so desperately needed.\nThe following days were filled with more nuisances than I would have liked. Several noble sons and relatives of the fallen knights approached me to thank me for bringing their bodies back. As word spread of the attack's catastrophe, more emphasis was placed on how my actions had been decisive in retrieving their sons' remains. The long negotiations to recover Bretonnian bodies could have taken days—maybe even weeks—if not for my intervention.\nBanquets and feasts turned into political theater. A headache, really. I just had to sit there, smile, say it wasn't a problem, and pretend anyone else would've done the same in that situation.\nThe following week, a Bretonnian duke arrived at the helmgart. I had to be present at that negotiation for the Grail Knight's body. When he was told that a squire had killed the Grail Knight, the duke couldn't hide his red face—clearly ashamed, clearly disbelieving. That a mere squire had slain one of the Lady's chosen paladins was nearly unthinkable to him, and the restrained fury in his expression was unmistakable.\nBy the end of the day, after a long and tense negotiation, the duke offered fifteen hundred crowns for the return of the Grail Knight's body, with armor and weapons intact. The price was far more than I had expected.\nSo… father will be able to pay off some debts early. And with that, my future finances are finally clean.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

How the hell do you stand this torture?\" I said, looking at Joachim while adjusting the shirt they had lent me for the banquet.\n\"What are you talking about, Albrecht? That's comfortable clothing… it's silk from Tilea, extremely expensive,\" Joachim replied, glancing around with a satisfied expression.\n\"How can this be comfortable?\" I muttered, trying to soften the hard shoes I was wearing. \"This is more like punishment.\"\n\"Well, get used to it,\" Joachim replied, unfazed. \"I don't know how the hell you killed that Bretonnian, but now you've got to live with the consequences.\"\nIt was one thing to be a cupbearer at these celebrations, where I only had to stay still and avoid attracting attention from the nobles and their nonsense. But now, I was trapped, turned into the center of attention. The Margrave had arranged a feast to celebrate the victory over Bretonnia, taking advantage of the fact that the Duke of Montfort had declared that the attack had been initiated by his forces and that their defeat had come at the hands of the Empire. The Margrave was so pleased he decided to throw a huge celebration—and of course, I was now caught in it, being observed by the entire Helmgart court.\nThe nobles looked delighted, and I felt completely out of place, barely fitting in this world no matter how noble my birth might be. I didn't like being at the center of it all—between the music, the noise, and the laughter. I could ignore all that if they would just ignore me, but they didn't. All eyes were on me, everyone eager to hear how I had killed one of Bretonnia's knights.\n\"I just pulled the trigger… though surviving long enough to do it was the real achievement,\" I said while following Joachim, who was heading over to watch some of the dances.\n\"Typical von Reinsfeld stuff, huh?\" said Joachim, pausing for a second, clearly holding back an insult.\n\"Yeah, but I don't get why your father is so set on throwing this party. The victory over the Bretonnians was months ago. If he wanted to mock the Duke of Montfort, that time has passed,\" I said while watching some of the strange dances being performed.\n\"It's never too late to celebrate. Besides, we were waiting for something,\" Joachim said with a smile that didn't convince me at all.\n\"Waiting for what?\" I asked him.\n\"Wait and see,\" he said, wearing a very fake smile.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, noble Albrecht,\" said a voice behind me.\nTurning around, I found a finely dressed woman, accompanied by an elegant maid and a young girl nervously holding an embroidered handkerchief.\n\"Young von Reinsfeld, allow me to present my daughter, Miss Elisa. Her father, Baron Luchsberg, is a good friend of your honorable father. He has heard of your… unusual bravery. Elisa, my dear, go on,\" the mother said, smiling and stepping back.\n\"Really? A friend of my father? Miracles do exist,\" I said, staring straight at the mother.\n\"Bless… blessings of Sigmar, Albrecht. I heard of your great feat. It must have been a tremendous display of courage,\" said the daughter, handing me the embroidered handkerchief.\n\"My lady, forgive this uncultured brute. As you can see, due to his young age, he doesn't fully understand the etiquette of these events,\" Joachim said, taking the handkerchief and placing it in one of my pockets, leaving the heraldry clearly visible.\n\"Ha, ha, it must all be so sudden, noble servant of Sigmar. I was wondering if you'd like to join me in viewing Helmgart's gardens. They're beautiful this time of year, and I could show you around,\" Elisa said.Follow current novels on\n\"I know them very well. For the past few years, I've been the one maintaining them—especially the rose bushes,\" I replied, trying to escape the situation.\n\"Then… you could show me. I'd love to hear about how you cared for such a magnificent and beautiful garden,\" she insisted again.\n\"Ah… no… I can't leave, since I'm a guest of honor… perhaps another day. It wouldn't be proper to abandon an event so carefully prepared by our noble host. I couldn't dishonor him by leaving early,\" I replied again, trying to shut it down.\n\"I understand… I hope we can speak soon,\" she said, putting on a sad face before walking away with her mother, the maid following behind.\n\"So this is what you meant, having to endure all this?\" I asked, looking at Joachim.\n\"It's not that bad. I highly doubt they're actually friends with your father. Your father has no friends—only people who fear him, or people he must obey. But they're clearly trying to get close to you. Baron Luchsberg has lost much of his wealth supporting political careers, so I'd bet they've already got that information on hand,\" Joachim said.\n\"What information?\" I asked again, confused.\n\"You'll find out soon enough. But know this—there are families that see you as a chest full of gold. Eleven years old and already a distinguished soldier—many families would love to tie you down, including my own. Later this afternoon, after the event, you'll be introduced to my cousin. Though, well… between us, she's quite ugly. That probably explains why she's still unmarried. So brace yourself. It won't be easy, especially with how much you hate all this,\" said Joachim.\n\"Well, if it cheers you up, father's planning a spring campaign to clear the orcs from the mountains. There've been some attacks, so it's necessary to deal with the green menace. He'll definitely send you along—and me too, of course. Though it's a bad omen that your last knight died under your watch, but still, I'd rather have you at my side knowing you're not the type to flee. You just become a lot more dangerous,\" Joachim said.\n\"I'll need more gunpowder. I ran out after my trip through Bretonnia, so I'll have to visit an alchemist. I've gotten the hang of my arquebus. Apparently, it takes a few practice shots to really understand how the bullets move through the air,\" I replied.\n\"Stop by the alchemist and stock up on vials, but make sure they're properly sealed. If it rains, your powder's useless—and that's not great when fighting orcs. So make sure you're well prepared,\" Joachim said.\n\"This is all so awful…\" I muttered, feeling someone approaching from behind again.\n\"Albrecht…\" said a familiar voice. \"Good… the Emperor's envoy has arrived,\" added the Margrave.\nI turned quickly and saw the Margrave, dressed in elaborate garments adorned with the emblems of his house.\n\"So, what happens now? I have an idea of what's going on, but I've no clue what I'm supposed to do,\" I said with a slight smile.\n\"Yes, that's why I'm here, Albrecht—to explain things so you don't stand there with a dumb look on your face while they're giving you the honors. You will treat the Emperor's envoy with utmost respect, always addressing him as 'my lord' or 'your lordship'. Always give thanks to me, to the Emperor, and to Sigmar for the honor of serving the Empire—and once again to Sigmar for protecting us in battle,\" said the Margrave.\n\"Your father and I spent a long time in Altdorf. The Emperor recommended that you be knighted, but he himself said it will happen when you turn fifteen. He'll personally knight you then, and you'll be given an immediate position in the Reiksguard. So you won't have to go through the usual squireship process. You'll become a member of the Emperor's guard the moment you turn fifteen. For that reason, the Emperor will gift you a young demi-griffon when you join the Reiksguard. So we'll need to continue your training diligently. There's been talk about gifting you a runic sword from our friends in the mountains, but that will depend on how many the Emperor receives. Many nobles are waiting on one, and the Emperor made promises. That's what's set aside for you,\" the Margrave said, looking straight at me.\n\"Great… a glorified bodyguard,\" I thought.\n\"Generous rewards indeed, Margrave,\" I replied with a wide smile.\n\"Yes, as for your father, the Emperor granted him some lands that were under his direct control. They're not worth much—just forests without villages. Not much use there. He also gave a generous payment in gold, but as I understand it, it was used to pay off the debts your father had accumulated—those he incurred to gain support and bribe officials for his mining rights. He was also granted toll rights for road usage toward Marienburg. And since there was a major political movement in the capital, the Emperor intervened and granted colonization rights on his lands, with the support of several Elector Counts and nobles present at court. He may now inform his freemen that they may travel to his territories to establish new settlements, in exchange for being tax-exempt for the next decade,\" the Margrave concluded.\n\"I guess father must've been pleased,\" I asked, as I hadn't seen him in some time.\n\"Yes, regarding you, he was proud. He wouldn't stop talking about how Sigmar had finally given him the heir he always wanted. Strange, considering your older brother is still alive. That's when he'd get angry—he spent a lot of time talking to judges about a deal to disinherit your older brother,\" said the Margrave with a grimace.\n'Well… it's something he always mentioned. My brother's more of a bookworm… he never liked any of that,' I said, recalling father's constant complaints.\n\"Alright then, to your seat of honor—and do as I told you,\" said the Margrave, pointing toward the banquet table.\nI slid into the chair, adopting a posture of readiness, while everything around me carried on. Music still echoed, and the dancers moved with grace—but something shifted immediately when the Emperor's envoy entered the hall. The music stopped abruptly, and the dancing ceased at once. Every eye turned toward him, watching in silence the man who bore the Emperor's emblems.\nThe silence was deep, almost tangible—like the air itself had thickened with expectation. The envoy, exuding solemn presence, ordered me to rise. His voice rang out in the hall as he unrolled a long scroll, which he began reading aloud.\nWith an imposing tone, he recited words I already knew—what the Margrave had told me earlier: that the Emperor would knight me at fifteen, and that I would be granted a demi-griffon. He deliberately omitted the part about the runic sword. He also spoke of my father, publicly detailing the same news the Margrave had already shared: the lands, the toll rights, the gold, and the colonization rights in the mining settlements.\nAt the end, I gave thanks as I had been instructed—bowing, invoking Sigmar's name—waiting to see the envoy's reaction. Apparently satisfied with my response, he nodded in approval, and the ceremony continued.\nAfter the reading, I was quickly surrounded by the local nobility and guests. They repeated the same ritual I had seen before: mothers and fathers pushing their daughters forward to hand me embroidered handkerchiefs marked with their family heraldry—each trying in their own way to stand out and catch my attention, all under the constant gaze of their servants. It was clear this was political strategy beneath a thin veil of courtesy.\nAs conversations bloomed, subtle tensions started to rise. The nobles competed quietly among themselves, dropping veiled insults and snide remarks, each trying to undermine the others. More than one tried to find a way to speak with me about future engagements, eager to use their position. My name was already well known, and my father's reputation carried weight—his foul temper was infamous throughout Reikland so it was better to talk to me than to him..\nHours passed. While everyone kept playing their little political games, I just kept smiling, pretending to be interested in their words while quietly thinking about how to escape this torture. Best not to talk too much—for now—and wait for things to settle down.\nFinally, after endless chatter, I returned to my seat, hoping for a moment of peace. But my rest didn't last long.\nAt the door, a knight appeared—covered in dust and mud. His presence clashed starkly with the elegant atmosphere, and immediately, all eyes turned to him. He paused for a moment, then without hesitation, walked straight toward me.\nThe Margrave's face tensed at once, visibly angered by the interruption. The knight, after a few seconds of silence, removed his helmet, revealing his face. I recognized him instantly, though he looked different. It was Rudolf—one of my father's knights—but with grayer hair and eyes full of exhaustion. Standing before me, he bowed deeply and knelt.\n\"My lord,\" he said, taking a long breath before continuing, \"your lord father… morr has claimed his soul.\"\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

My heart was pounding, and I felt warmth in my ears—something I hadn't experienced in a long time.\nThe Margrave, visibly surprised, frowned and stared at me. \"What happened? He… he looked fine when I last saw him in the capital,\" he said, with a mix of disbelief and confusion.\n\"I don't know all the details… truly, forgive me, my lord. I failed your father… he was killed by bandits on his way back from Altdorf,\" Rudolf answered, his eyes puffy and nearly red, clearly shaken.\n\"But you're still breathing… what happened?\" I asked, staring at him, unable to hide my need for answers.\n\"I… never, my lord… I would never. We were brothers-in-arms. We fought together, bled together, won and lost together. By Sigmar, I swear, if it had been in my power, I would've given my life to save your father,\" said Rudolf, his voice nearly breaking, emotion pouring through every word.\n\"Then explain it. How is it possible that he's dead and you're here claiming innocence?\" said the Margrave, now clearly irritated, his jaw clenched tight.\n\"Your… father,\" Rudolf said, swallowing hard. \"He ordered me to return to Reinsfeld ahead of him to start processing purchase orders for materials and tools for a new village project funded by the Margrave's gold. Almost all of his escort left three days before his departure. He remained behind with two knights to handle unfinished matters with his son Heinrich. He was supposed to return three days later after finalizing everything with the judge. And he did… we found his body near the road to Reinsfeld when we went to meet him. Surrounded by mutilated corpses—what appeared to be bandits,\" Rudolf explained, clearing his throat, as if the weight of the words made them harder to speak.\nThe Margrave fell silent, lost in thought, staring at the floor as he processed the information. \"Many things come to mind about what could've happened...\" he finally said in a grave tone.\n\"Like what?\" I asked, keeping a serious face but letting a faint hint of false grief show.\n\"Your brother. A jealous noble. An angry merchant. Bitter peasants… too many motives. Your father wasn't loved… he was feared and respected for it. He's one of the few nobles I know who's never had a peasant rebellion under his rule—because he always fulfilled his duty of protection. But… the Von Kesselheims may have seen their claim to your lands in jeopardy… it's a possibility,\" said the Margrave, glancing toward the surrounding nobles, whose hushed whispers already betrayed their awareness of what was happening.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by\n\"What about Heinrich… any suspicion?\" I asked, looking at Rudolf for more answers.\n\"No… no… In fact, they were getting along for the first time. It surprised me when I saw them. They reached an agreement… Heinrich would be disinherited, and in return, your father would pay for a full university education in Altdorf. Heinrich would renounce his claim and even give up his surname. So…\" Rudolf began, before being interrupted by the Margrave.\n\"It makes no sense… If he agreed to that before a judge, his case is dead. He wouldn't gain anything from the murder… So, was the Baron's body desecrated?\" the Margrave asked, his stare sharp, his words slicing through the air like a blade.\n\"No… untouched. As I said, we found him surrounded by bandits. I think he killed them all… but he was so badly wounded that he succumbed to his injuries. His purse, his sword, his armor—they were all intact. It wasn't a robbery. Or if it was, he killed every last one of them. We found his body seated against a tree,\" explained Rudolf, his voice trembling more with each word.\n\"Whoever did it… got away with it, I suppose,\" I said, clenching my fists and teeth. Though inside, I was far too pleased with the outcome. No one could challenge my inheritance now—the sole heir to three villages, a small castle, the gold I had stashed away, father's coffers, and all the minerals waiting in the Grey Mountains… especially with no chains. Well, first I needed to deal with the Margrave.\n\"Your father was… too brave, perhaps… didn't make the wisest decision,\" said the Margrave, grimacing as he spoke, like he couldn't quite fit the pieces together.\n\"Certainly…\" I said, breathing audibly. \"Margrave Reinhardt, I know this banquet is partly in my honor, but I must beg you to allow me to take my leave… both from this noble gathering and from your service,\" I said, my voice tinged with sorrow, though carefully restrained.\n\"Why? We must finish your training. You can assign someone to manage your lands while you pursue a brilliant future. I know this is a dreadful moment, but you can't throw it all away… Do you have any idea how many people would kill to have their son in the Reiksguard—with imperial recommendation and imperial gifts?\" said the Margrave, raising an eyebrow, almost as if trying to make me see what I was giving up.\n\"I wish to say goodbye to my father… Margrave… I need to. I want to see him before the priests of Morr bury him in his garden. I couldn't rest easy knowing that… I can't even remember his face,\" I said, forcing myself to shed a tear.\nI saw the Margrave grimace, clearly reluctant to let me leave. \"Very well. But you must return once it's done… your father would've wanted you in the Reiksguard,\" the Margrave said, his voice trying to sound firm but laced with concern.\n\"Thank you very much, your lordship. My journey will be swift. I hope to return soon,\" I replied, rising from my chair with purpose.\n\"Head to the stables. Rudolf will leave as soon as possible,\" I said, just as I turned to head toward my room.\nI quickly removed the garments that had been driving me insane—the elegant noble attire that made me feel like a caged animal—and put on servant's clothes, the only ones that still felt comfortable. I had grown so much over the past years that the clothes I arrived with no longer fit—they hung off my shoulders like ornaments. As for noble garments, forget it—nothing fit right anymore.\nI didn't take long to come out carrying the chest with all the wealth I had accumulated, and once I met with Rudolf, we headed for the stables. As I mounted my horse, I found the rest of my father's men-at-arms. Like Rudolf, they were covered in dust, their horses muddied. They all looked at me with eyes full of guilt, as if waiting for me to blame them for my father's death.\nWe immediately began the journey back, stopping only to rest in the lands of other nobles, who allowed us to sleep in their guest quarters. The guards who accompanied me were on edge, like hawks, reacting violently to any potential threat. They barely strayed far from me whenever the road neared dense woods. The fear of another ambush kept them tense, and the shadows beneath the trees always seemed more menacing than they really were.\nIt wasn't long before we crossed the river again and continued riding toward Reinsfeld.\nAs we reached the forest's edge, all the men-at-arms came to a halt. Rudolf rode closer, wearing a serious, almost grim expression. \"This is where it happened, my lord… this is where we found your father,\" the knight said, pointing to an open area within the trees.\nI dismounted and walked toward the spot he indicated. The air was heavy with the same desolation I had been avoiding throughout the journey. The bark on several trees was scarred, clearly where a great sword had struck with force. Though the scene was calm now, the traces of what had happened still lingered. However, after so many days, it would be impossible to determine exactly what had occurred. All that remained was the fact that whoever had killed my father had gotten away with it.\n\"Nothing else? Is there nothing more we can do here?\" I said, turning to Rudolf and the others. \"Let's go home,\" I ordered, spurring my horse sharply to leave the area as quickly as possible.\nAn hour later, we reached the village, and the progress was visible. There were more houses than I remembered, a good sign that the settlement had grown in recent years. In the distance, I saw a large building on the village outskirts, likely a new business, given the number of wagons parked outside and the size of the structure. At least, the town seemed to be thriving.\nThough it was already night, we didn't hesitate to head for the Temple of Morr, located just beyond the village. We passed through the stone walls that surrounded the graveyard—another measure to ensure privacy for funeral rites.\nSilence reigned as we entered, and the priests of Morr received us without a word, guiding us down into the crypt beneath the temple. Only a single candle lit the way, casting long shadows and creating an oppressive, grim atmosphere.\nEventually, we reached a stone door. The priest began unlocking it, removing a seal and turning a series of hidden mechanisms, gesturing for me to step inside. It was clearly the family crypt, as I saw several tombs carved with the names of my ancestors. Everything was wrapped in a thick silence that seemed to weigh in the air.\nAt the center stood a stone slab. Upon it lay my father's body, covered in familiar-colored cloths and adorned with the family heraldry. His greatsword rested on his chest, and his armor was laid carefully over the fabrics, as if he were still ready for battle.\n\"May Morr guide your father's soul to the eternal garden, and may the crow lift the weight of despair from you. Will you keep vigil, young lord?\" said the priest of Morr, his voice muted and respectful, though filled with a reverence that felt unfamiliar to me.\n\"No… seal it… let his soul rest forever in Morr's garden,\" I answered firmly, my gaze fixed on my father's body.\nThe cultists of Morr moved quickly. They shifted a part of the stone table to lift the body together, taking my father and placing him in his tomb.\nWhen the tomb was closed, sealed, and covered, the cultists began reciting prayers and placing protective wards against necromancy, ensuring that nothing could disturb his rest.\n\"In Morr's shadow, we are all equal. But your father was a man of duty, and his name will not be lost in the mist of forgetfulness,\" said the priest as he set the final nameplate on my father's grave.\nI stood there, watching in silence. The last seal was set, and finally, I stepped back. The priests sealed the crypt once more, and the darkness that had already begun to swallow the place closed in entirely.\nAs I exited the crypt, my guard was waiting for me.\n\"Will you return to Helmgart tomorrow, my lord?\" Rudolf asked, guiding me back to the castle.\n\"No… I don't plan to go back,\" I said with a smile.\n\"But my lord, your education… you're still too young to take on your duties and—\" Rudolf said, clearly worried.\n\"I don't need a regency, or anyone managing my estate… I'm finally free, and I'm going to rule even better than father ever did,\" I said, smiling.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It wasn't anything I didn't expect, but seeing the head of a minotaur hanging there, accompanied by a painting of my father in his youth defeating the beast, left me speechless. \"Damn… he killed a minotaur,\" I muttered to myself, watching how his younger face stood firm in the painting, while the creature's severed head hung above it.\n\"So this is what his room looked like…\" I murmured as I turned slowly through the space. \"Of course it would be decorated with monster heads and armor, but I didn't expect it to have paintings from when he killed them too…\"\nThis room was mine now, which felt strange. But surrounded by all those monster heads, it was hard to relax. \"Well, no time to sleep the day away. That will come when I can finally relax with the peasants' taxes. Only then will I sleep until there's no tiredness left in me,\" I said with an ironic smile.\nI headed for my father's study. There was much to do. I immediately sat at the dark wooden desk, the surface cluttered with papers, letters, and documents requiring my attention.\nI ate something quickly while flipping through the papers, well aware that time would not wait. I needed to review the documents related to my family's finances. I glanced at the coffers and began doing calculations in my head.\n\"Let's see what we've got,\" I muttered, beginning to go through the records.\nThe family coffers held a total of two thousand two hundred and forty-three gold crowns — a considerable amount, though not enough to live in luxury until my death. As expected, the gold came from several sources. After deductions and the 25% sent to the Prince of Altdorf, the family's net income came mainly from peasant taxes, which no longer surprised me. It was a reliable source, but the money was distributed in a way that always made it feel like it wasn't enough, especially since the taxes weren't stable and depended entirely on the harvest.\nAside from taxes, my income came from various goods, which couldn't be underestimated. The family mill provided a steady income, and the commercial licenses issued within our lands also helped keep the treasury filled. However, the standout — the real money-maker — was the sale of horses, especially warhorses.\nTo my surprise, the sale of warhorses generated enormous profits. Each one sold for ten to twenty gold crowns, and the finest specimens auctioned in Altdorf could go for hundreds. About five hundred horses were sold each year. That didn't even include the sale of regular horses, which also brought in a respectable amount of money, though not as lucrative. These were mostly sold as work animals — to well-off peasants or people in need of transport — but the income from each one was stable.\nAt the same time, I reviewed the report from the last Imperial census, conducted in the year 2285. It detailed the population of the villages under my control: Reinsfeld, my main village, had nine thousand inhabitants — an impressive number, given the region's conditions. Then there was the unnamed village governed by Rudolf in my name, with three thousand inhabitants. Still without a formal name, it was growing slowly but remained loyal. Another village, home to two thousand people, was under one of my knights' command. And finally, the newly established mining settlement had around three hundred residents.\nWhat caught my attention in the census was the gender distribution: men and women were nearly equal in number, with a slight edge to the women — likely a result of battlefield casualties.\nAltogether, the total peasant population under my rule was about fourteen thousand, most of them working the fields, tending livestock, or laboring in the mines. While roughly two thousand were either too young or too old to contribute actively, the vast majority were productive, keeping the economic engine running.\nOn average, annual income hovered around twenty-five thousand gold crowns, far more than I had initially estimated. The sale of horses proved to be by far the most profitable source of income — thanks to the massive herds my father had accumulated over the years. Each warhorse fetched a high price, and the steady sale of other horses helped keep the treasury strong. The horse trade was clearly one of the pillars of the estate.\nBut despite the income, expenses were equally high.\nThe garrisons made up a large part of the budget. We had four hundred guards, each receiving two silver shillings per day, plus food rations and a weekly allowance for a mug of beer. With months lasting 32 or 33 days, the yearly cost of the guards reached nearly sixteen thousand crowns — a considerable burden.\nTo that, I added the annual cost of replacing military gear, which came to about three hundred crowns.\nCaring for the horses was another major expense. Though the families responsible for the stables were exempt from taxes, they still charged a thousand crowns per year to cover the cost of grain, horseshoes, and training.\nThe religious cults also consumed a significant part of the budget: two thousand crowns to the cult of Sigmar, another two thousand to Shallya, a thousand to Morr, and a thousand to Taal and Rhya. These were unavoidable yearly expenses, as the cults were an essential part of life in the Empire's lands.\nThere were, in the end, fifty administrative workers, between scribes and tax collectors, who cost a total of fifteen hundred crowns a year. And I couldn't forget the two hundred crowns set aside for the stablehands and servants responsible for maintaining the stables and other minor matters.\nAdding all that together, the annual expenses quickly consumed over all of the total income. After all deductions, only about two hundred crowns remained—money I could actually move toward other projects or emergencies.\n\"Shit… how is it possible to have so many expenses?\" I thought, staring at the figures in the ledger. \"Of course, we have more than three percent of the population under arms. How could we not have high costs? That's why there's so much spending. Father invested too much in security.\"\nI looked closer at the numbers. Overmilitarized. Based on our population, we should only have a third as many guards. But the excess personnel, while justifiable due to the importance of protecting the land, represented an economic burden that needed to be reconsidered.\n\"As much as I'd like to, I can't cut military expenses. Or the cult contributions. And I definitely can't cut horse care, since they finance nearly everything else,\" I said aloud, going over the numbers again. \"I need the guards to protect the land. Especially from that damned family. If they sense weakness, they'll take advantage of it—and test me. And if the Margrave feels insulted, he might act... I can't let that happen. The first thing I need to do is improve the tax system. Revenues are stagnating. At this rate, I won't be able to sustain the guard or the cults. And if those damned merchants keep lowballing prices, we're not going anywhere. Let's see here... a purchase order for eight hundred crowns from the Schilderheim merchants—for tools and construction materials…\"\nI paused for a moment, flipping through the documents with growing frustration.\n\"The mine…\" I murmured, deep in thought. \"Still no income. Here it is... Father was selling iron ore to a local merchant—ten crowns per ton… what? Ten crowns? Per ton?! That's daylight robbery!\"Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nMy voice rose unintentionally, the anger rushing in. \"This is giving the ore away! What the hell was Father thinking?\"\nI sighed, running a hand across my forehead. Income calculations were critical.\n\"To process iron, I need a proper smelter. But building it will take time. And, above all… gold. I have to use what I have wisely. I can't waste it, but I need to invest in the right places,\" I muttered, rising from my chair and pacing the room, trying to organize my thoughts.\n\"The blacksmiths will need proper tools to process the iron. I'll also need wood and stone for the smelter's construction. All of that requires tools—tools I don't currently have. I need to see what the local merchants can supply… and how much.\"\nI'd have to speak to the blacksmith personally. See how he could help me get what I needed... In the meantime, the shipment I was waiting for should arrive soon, I told myself, glancing at the papers again, frustration simmering.\nI sighed and sat down again, the stress mounting as I weighed each decision. The situation wasn't easy.\n\"Guards,\" I called, raising my voice with purpose. Two of them opened the door almost immediately, appearing at the entrance.\n\"Bring in the tax collectors. Now,\" I ordered, my eyes fixed on the door. \"I have work for them.\"\nThe guards nodded in silence, their professionalism standing out in the quiet of the moment, and they quickly left the office. Several long minutes passed before the collectors finally entered the hall, their footsteps firm and serious, their neatly adjusted uniforms reflecting the formality of such meetings.\nI stood watching, scanning their faces, searching for the man I expected to see—but he wasn't there. I frowned, letting out a faint sigh. \"What happened to one of my father's collectors? An older man—always had a nose for taxes,\" I asked, eyes narrowing as I addressed the group.\nA young collector, his face tense with nerves, was the first to answer. \"My… father… passed away three summers ago, peacefully in his bed, my lord,\" he said, almost stammering.\nHis voice—and his youth—caught me off guard. It was clear he wasn't the man I was used to seeing handle our accounts. \"Too young,\" I thought to myself.\n\"And you inherited the position?\" I asked, my tone direct, expecting a clear answer.\n\"Yes, my lord… I was trained by him. Your lord father believed there was no one better to replace him,\" he replied, his voice trembling slightly. The boy was clearly nervous—it showed in how he spoke, in the way he stood.\n\"I see,\" I murmured, thoughtful. I glanced back at the group, noticing the differences among them. \"Very well,\" I continued, shifting my focus back to business. \"I know it's the start of the year and that you're only expected to keep the ledgers updated, but I'm putting you to work now. I want a full land survey of all my subjects' properties. A complete\ncadastre,\" I stated, leaving no doubt about the weight of the task.\nI stood and walked over to the table, where several family documents lay scattered, ready for review. \"From now on, I want every plot of land measured and tied to the imperial census,\" I continued. \"Assume each hectare should yield at least half a ton of grain—regardless of actual output. By next month, I want all farmland measured, with updated information. We'll use that data for the next tax season, to determine what each household owes.\"\nThe room fell into silence. The collectors exchanged glances—silent doubts passed among them. The order meant heavy work.\n\"Understood?\" I asked, my voice firm.\n\"My lord, I have no objections, but…\" one began hesitantly. \"This will take time. We'll need more men to complete such a large survey, and with the harvests heavy work ongoing, the peasants might resist cooperating.\"\n\"I know,\" I replied firmly, \"but it's imperative we do this. The tax system must be reorganized, and we can't keep operating with no idea of what each parcel produces. I need that information for the next tax cycle. I don't want excuses. The farmland must be measured, and we must ensure all production is recorded accurately. Request as much help as you need from the guards.\"\nThey all fell silent.\n\"What are you staring at? I don't pay you to breathe—get to work, damn it!\" I shouted angrily, and the collectors immediately began carrying out my orders.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It was the only way to ensure a stable income, since a bad harvest could destroy everything I had worked to preserve. Every season was an uncertainty, and if I failed to collect enough, the consequences would be severe.\n\"I could give ledgers to the merchants and force them to declare their earnings... Paper can't be that expensive, no idea how much it costs, but I still remember how the priest at the Sigmar chapel guarded his scrolls like sacred relics…\" I murmured as I examined the documents in front of me. Calculating taxes had always been a tedious task—but a necessary one. \"With the land survey, I might be able to make the tax system more predictable. But first, I need to find a way to generate more income. The mine... it's not a good option. Too much work for too little profit. The real business is in processing the iron here.\"\nI stood up, my mind racing, analyzing all available options. The mine felt like a trap I couldn't escape, but processing the ore here in town would create value much faster. I needed to find a way to make that process work.\n\"I'm heading to the village. Notify a dozen guards to accompany me,\" I told the soldiers posted outside my office. They ran off immediately, even pushing past each other to carry out my order as quickly as possible.\nIt didn't take long to reach the courtyard where my horse was kept, and some guards followed behind, keeping a respectful distance while watching the surroundings. I rode with determination toward the village blacksmith, thinking about everything I needed to discuss with the master smith.\nOn the way, I passed several young men offering to make nails, sharpen knives, or fix hinges. Life in the village carried on as usual. I didn't pay them much attention.\nWhen I arrived at the forge, the heat of the fire and the sound of hammering iron greeted me. I dismounted and stepped into the artisan's workspace, where the usual bustle was underway. The air was thick with the smell of iron and smoke.\nJust like the first time I'd visited, the forge was full of young workers toiling without rest. They moved iron ore and coal, forged tools, and repaired anything that needed fixing. Sweat glistened on their foreheads, and their hands were black from constant labor. None of them looked ready to stop, even though the air was as hot as the metal they worked.\nMy presence didn't go unnoticed. The apprentices and workers paused for a moment—some curious, others showing a hint of respect for the status I represented.\nAt last, the master smith came out to meet us. His hands were blackened, and he tried to wipe them with a rag, though the grime wouldn't come off. His smile was warm, if a bit weary, like a man who hadn't stopped working in days.\n\"My lord, it's an honor to receive you. How can I help you today?\" he asked, dropping the rag and extending a hand already marked by years of labor.\n\"I came to talk about tool production. I need to know how many you can make for me. Consider it an urgent order… I need axes. Around three hundred,\" I said, shaking my head at the sight of his soot-covered hand.\n\"Three hundred…\" he repeated, wiping his forehead with a blackened hand. \"I'm afraid I can't handle that kind of volume, my lord. Too much work for me and my boys to complete in a short timeframe.\" His voice was tired and somewhat worried. \"We've had a constant flow of orders from merchants—repairs to carts and other parts. If you gave me a bit more time…\"\n\"How many can you deliver by the end of the week?\" I interrupted, looking him straight in the eye.\n\"Two… maybe three…\" the blacksmith replied hesitantly. \"I recently had to let go of many of my apprentices. They reached the age where they could work on their own. I only kept one—the best of them. The rest I let go. Now I'm working with only the youngest, and the backlog is growing.\"\n\"And if I pay you more, how much could you produce?\" I asked, assessing the situation. I needed those tools, and time was running out.\nHe shrugged, resigned. \"I could do it faster, but I'd need more hands. If I had more workers, I could increase capacity.\"\n\"Fine, thanks... I suppose,\" I said, turning to leave the forge. I walked out of the workshop.\nI mounted my horse and, as I rode through the village streets, I thought about how I could speed up iron production.\nThen an idea struck me. I remembered the young blacksmiths who offered their services on the streets, usually ignored by the local merchants. Perhaps they could help me.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nI turned around and retraced my steps, searching the alleys for the youths who usually offered minor repairs or smithing services. I found them quickly. There were several of them, but their work was limited, and their prices too low—far too low to be sustainable. Still, I had a feeling they could be useful.\nI wasn't planning to waste time with them, but then one young man stepped forward, slipping past my guards and approaching me.\n\"My lord… do you need your horse's shoes repaired? They look worn,\" he said, holding a hammer in one hand and a horseshoe under his arm.\nAsking around about the goods I was interested in buying, I began learning the local prices. The problem was, if I started haggling too aggressively, it might not reflect well on me. In fact, it wasn't very noble to haggle… not at all. That kind of behavior might be acceptable for a merchant or a petty landowner, but not for someone in my position.\nWhat truly shocked me was how expensive paper was—two silver shillings for a single sheet. One sheet cost the same as paying a guard to watch over the town for an entire day. That was the market price, of course—likely half that if you deducted the merchant's profit.\nAnother surprise: soap. Incredibly expensive. A shilling for plain soap, and two for the perfumed ones. What worried me was that, with prices like these, most families couldn't afford quality products—which made me realize there was an opportunity here.\nI already had ideas for business. After all, during slow moments—especially back in Africa or Ukraine—I'd spend hours doom scrolling online, and ideas always came from that idle time. Paper production required specialized tools and machinery. While profitable, it also demanded time and investment. For now, I needed something with quick returns to cover future expenses. I couldn't sit around waiting for someone to build me a press or mold.\nBut soap… soap was a different story. It was incredibly simple to produce. The triglycerides found in animal fat whether from cows, pigs, wild game, or even horses culled during warhorse training were abundant. Ashes, when processed correctly, yielded potassium and sodium oxides. Once dissolved in water, these oxides formed hydroxide solutions. When mixed with triglycerides under heat, they triggered a saponification reaction, breaking the ester bonds and producing salt of fatty acids . soap.Maybe not luxurious, but potentially very profitable if done in bulk.\nAll I needed were some pots, a few cloths to strain the water from the fat, and some wooden molds—nothing more. With those basic tools, I could start producing soap. Most importantly, without needing expensive machinery or large investments. The more I thought about it, the more excited I became. It looked like a profitable business built on scraps.\nI was about to buy a sheet of paper to pin in the village square to find workers—but then I remembered most people probably couldn't read well. In fact, only those attending the Sigmar chapel likely had any formal education, and most parents wouldn't send their kids to school when they could be working.\nSo I decided to send one of the guards to shout through the village that I was looking for workers. I offered one shilling per day and said I needed ten people. That was enough—within three minutes, a line of peasants had formed in front of him, eager to help.\nSeeing how fast the response came, I headed back to the village blacksmith to buy a few pots. Fortunately, he had plenty in stock, as they were common goods. I bought them without hesitation.\nThe fat came from hunters I allowed to operate in my woods. They delivered several kilograms of animal fat. For water, we just fetched it from the nearby river. Everything was falling into place.\nWith everything in hand, I began teaching the peasants how to make soap. I explained the process step-by-step. Some seemed confused at first, but quickly picked it up. I showed them how to process ash in warm water to obtain hydroxides. How to boil the fat in water and add the hydroxides to cause the saponification reaction—waiting until it thickened.\nI also explained they'd need to monitor the mixture over the next few hours—it needed time to cook properly. Once it thickened, they'd separate it from the water using a wooden spoon I had perforated with a knife to help drain it. Then, they'd squeeze it through cloth to remove every drop of water. Finally, they'd pour it into loaf molds so the soap could set and harden over the next two or three days.\nWith clear instructions, the group got to work immediately—forming a small artisanal production chain. Some stirred the mixture in large pots, melting the fat, while others handled the ashes, mixing them with warm water.\nCoordination was key. Though primitive, the process worked. Each task was being handled properly, and most importantly, they didn't ruin the batch. It was impressive to see how, in such a short time, they managed to produce a decent batch of soap. It wasn't fancy, but the returns were more than worth the effort.\nFor now, we only had a couple of pots on the riverbank, but this could be improved over time. I could build a more suitable structure to process materials more efficiently, increasing output while reducing effort. But for now, this basic method was more than enough.\nThe real value in this venture lay in its simplicity. There were no major costs, and the profit from selling the soap could be considerable. Over time, I could refine the process, but for the moment, I just had to keep moving forward—and selling.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Observing the circumstances, I quickly realized I had to find a way to source fat without disrupting the flow of my other activities or available resources.\nThe family cows weren't a viable option for constant fat supply, as they were only slaughtered when necessary for personal consumption. Slaughtering more of them for this endeavor could destabilize my own food supply and its byproducts. Pigs, however, were a much more viable alternative. They were common animals, easy to raise and maintain, and their slaughter wasn't a big issue since they were literally bred for that purpose.\nI could place a herald in the village, offering to buy all the animal fat the peasants could provide. That would encourage the locals to seize the opportunity and sell their fat. I could also incentivize local hunters to increase their game quotas by granting them more permits beyond the standard allowance.\nMoreover, having a steady fat supply would give me greater control over soap production, which was crucial for scaling the operation. Over time, I could organize the business more efficiently, hire more workers, and perhaps even expand production to export soap to other regions.\nWhen I started noticing movement near the bridge, my eyes focused on a large group of people working under the guard's supervision.\nWith the arrival of several young blacksmiths ready to work, construction of the iron smelting furnace began immediately. Although the ground needed preparation, most of the smiths wasted no time and started dividing tasks based on their skills. While some excavated and leveled the land, others began selecting the appropriate stones for the furnace base.\nThe more experienced smiths, who had learned from older craftsmen or tradition, began arranging the stones and preparing the refractory clay to bind them. This clay was crucial, as it needed to withstand extremely high temperatures without crumbling. The blacksmiths worked in coordination, forming the furnace base with a solid layer of stones, then binding them with the clay.\nThe process advanced quickly, thanks to the large number of smiths working in different areas simultaneously. While some dug and prepared the ground, others were already building up the furnace walls, using the stone and clay mix to raise the structure. The speed of construction surprised me—thanks to the efficiency of the continuous shifts, with no long breaks, the furnace took shape much faster than anticipated.\nI approached the group of smiths, surprised by their numbers. I had expected maybe ten or twenty, but there were almost fifty.\nIt wasn't long before the young blacksmith—who had been tirelessly working on the furnace—left his task and came to me with hands covered in clay and a look of satisfaction, though tinged with urgency.\n\"My lord… I brought as many as I could. I think I can still get more, but we wanted to get started right away,\" he said, wiping his nose and breathing heavily.\n\"There are still more?\" I asked, astonished at the number of smiths he had already gathered. I was genuinely impressed by how quickly he had mobilized so many.\n\"Well…\" he said, looking at the ground, a bit nervous, \"many of the ones I brought are smiths who left the forge years ago. The local smith only hires the best—or those he can afford to pay. The rest, without work, offer their services on the street in exchange for food or leave town to try their luck in bigger cities. In the worst cases, they return to their families' farms and become peasants. That's how I found them. I think I can still bring more, if that's not a problem,\" he added, glancing shyly at the others working nearby.\n\"No… honestly, it's not. I have more iron ore than they could process, so I'll likely need many more hands, seasoned and experienced. This is going to hit my finances hard, but I need this to succeed. Do you think it's the same in other towns?\" I asked, thoughtful as I watched the ongoing work.\n\"Yes, my lord… I believe if things are similar to here, then there must be many smiths who've given up or returned to their families' fields. Others must have gone to the big cities. It's likely the situation is the same elsewhere,\" the young blacksmith replied, looking at the other workers with a hint of sadness.\n\"It's good to know. And to think those skilled hands might be wasted in the fields… Fine, if I need one hundred blacksmiths working, how many of these furnaces could we build?\" I asked, watching the others organize and prepare more materials.\n\"We could build about fifty furnaces, my lord. Iron can be forged in the ones we have, but to make high-quality iron, we need something more complex. Unfortunately, I don't have the knowledge to help you build something of that scale. A furnace like those in Nuln would be needed to smelt the ore properly,\" the young man explained seriously.\n\"And what about steel? Can you make steel with these furnaces?\" I asked, genuinely curious. My mind had already opened to the possibilities of processing steel instead of just iron.\n\"It's feasible, my lord… though very difficult. You need to keep the furnace hot using bellows, then throw in crushed iron ore, making sure it mixes as closely as possible with red-hot charcoal. Then it must be stirred constantly so the iron bits start to fuse. Once a big enough mass of metal forms, it must be removed and hammered to eliminate impurities. This process must be repeated many times to turn iron into steel,\" the young blacksmith said, almost reverently describing the complexity of the process.\n\"Good. I'll give you the gold needed for the remaining forty-four furnaces. Adjust your plans—we're taking a risk with this venture. Find every apprentice you can and bring them to work with me. I'll send heralds to my other villages to recruit more hands,\" I ordered firmly, deciding this investment would be crucial for the future of my lands.\n\"When will it be ready?\" I asked, already preparing to leave and continue with my other tasks.\n\"Three days, my lord. First we need to prepare the ground and wait for the clay to harden before we can continue building the furnace... In three days, we could be producing iron, my lord... but, what kind of production do you want?\" the young blacksmith replied with a calculating look, as if he were already assessing the materials needed to fulfill my request.\n\"Axes. Woodcutter axes. I intend to cut down the nearby forests to gather large quantities of timber for construction, so I first need proper tools — and then I'll look for the workers,\" I answered, thinking of the massive task ahead. Every step had to be carefully calculated.\n\"I see... It's feasible, my lord. We'll need handles, of course. You'll have to speak to the local carpenter about that — or we could find people with experience. There are many who know the basics, but if you want something of quality...\" said Kurt, watching as the other workers followed his lead, striking and organizing tools.\n\"I'll do just that... I'll speak to the local carpenter. But I'll also need to make sure they're ready. I need more than just the basics, so I'll look for experienced workers who can handle a larger project,\" I said, already thinking about how to optimize the available resources for my ambitious venture.\n\"And your name, young blacksmith?\" I asked suddenly, realizing I still didn't know how to call him — and I didn't want to overlook such a basic detail in this sort of arrangement.\n\"Kurt, my lord,\" the blacksmith said with a slight smile, seemingly pleased with the attention I was giving him. His face, still stained with soot and mud, showed a trace of pride for the work he was doing.\n\"Good, Kurt. I'll send the rest of the gold once I return to the castle. I'll also send a few guards to protect this place until things are more organized. It will take time, but I believe we'll be able to set up a proper smithy that can meet my future tool demands,\" I replied, spurring my horse as I turned to leave.\nKurt nodded confidently, watching me ride away.\nAs the day went on, activity in the village continued in an orderly fashion, though the weight of responsibility remained firmly on my shoulders. To prevent further complications, I decided to leave a second herald in the village. I instructed him to announce that, starting the next day, those with carpentry skills should present themselves for work — mostly to craft tool handles. This included axes, picks, shovels, hoes... whatever was needed. I only required a small group, no more than ten people, to take charge of this first stage of production.\nThe wood cut by the local lumberjacks would be processed into handles, while the blacksmiths forged the heads of the tools, joining the wedge and sharpening the blade on a whetstone. With this system, in a matter of days, we'd have the first tools ready to hand out to new lumberjacks, who could then begin their work. Thus, a second production line would soon emerge. If everything went according to plan, the new lumberjacks would start working, which would allow me to expand production and explore other industries.\nFor now, however, all of this remained an expense. Today alone I had spent around one hundred and seventy gold crowns, and although that seemed like a lot, the potential profit it could yield if everything went well would far exceed that initial cost. If iron tools were produced efficiently, I could sell them — or even sell the processed iron directly, which would offer a good profit margin.\nIn the afternoon, I decided to relax by training with a wooden sword in the castle yard. I hadn't forgotten the importance of training — especially because, as a ruler, being able to fight was crucial. In many cases, martial skill is the difference between a ruler who endures and one who dies quickly in battle. And while many focused on knightly tactics, I had learned to train differently.Google seaʀᴄh\nMy training was based on close-quarters combat techniques I had learned during my years in the Foreign Legion. In real combat, the one who controlled the fight wasn't always the best armed — well, unless they had a blessed magic sword that could pierce steel — but rather the one who knew how to use their environment and movement to their advantage. My strategy, therefore, focused on bringing the enemy down quickly. Fighting in armor was difficult, and if I couldn't break through my opponent's defenses, I had to be agile enough to throw them to the ground and stab them while they were helpless.\nIn my mind, Judo became a key ally in that kind of combat. Holds and takedowns were essential, and Taekwondo also served as a useful tool to strike vulnerable points — knees, thighs — quickly weakening the enemy and putting them at a disadvantage.\nSo, my training didn't just involve swordsmanship, but also perfecting my movements and control over my body. Every kick, every turn, every step was designed to leave the opponent without options — to always take the advantage without losing control. As I trained, sweat drenched my face, but concentration kept me focused. I was more prepared than ever for the challenges ahead.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I stretched, yawning with my mouth wide open, and changed out of my nightwear into something more suitable for training. As always, the tasks wouldn't wait. The sweat I was about to shed was inevitable, but something I had already learned to accept.\nI had a light breakfast: a few pieces of dried beef jerky, accompanied by freshly pressed apple juice—the only fruit I had nearby. I had made some drastic decisions to reduce expenses in the keep; from nearly a hundred servants, only thirty remained. The others, those who just stood around waiting for my father's orders, were dismissed. We couldn't afford that kind of luxury. Only the cooks, stablehands, and cleaners stayed. The servants' wages, though insignificant to some, made up most of my expenses, and the keep could still function with far fewer people.\nI trained for an hour. I focused on fencing but also began getting used to spending long hours wearing armor. More and more often, I found myself walking through the castle with a chainmail hauberk over me, as a constant reminder that the weight wasn't just physical. With every session, I learned to act with it, to move as if it were part of me.\nToday was a crucial day. Aside from overseeing soap production, I needed to initiate the manufacturing of tool handles of all kinds. I had to check on the progress at the forge, inspect the workshop construction, and make sure all materials were ready for use. But most importantly, I had to go to the Cult of Shallya. They would be the first to show interest in buying the soap I produced. Their work with the needy—those who couldn't afford a doctor or midwife—was invaluable, and I couldn't afford to miss that opportunity.\nI quickly saddled my horse and prepared to head out. The armor felt heavy, but I was getting used to it. In the distance, I saw my guards forming up; my men were more organized than ever.\nAs we moved on, the morning fog began to clear, and the movement of peasants and workers on the hill in front of me came into view. As we got closer, I found a small crowd gathered, all with curious and expectant eyes. The offer of paying a shilling was almost twice what they'd earn working the fields, which made my proposal quite attractive.\nPaying low wages for unskilled labor might be tempting, but it was essential that my tax administration be efficient and precise. Well-paid workers, whose identities I knew, would be much easier to tax later.\nSo, instead of hiring the whole crowd, I limited myself to picking ten out of the forty who had shown up, paying the wage I had promised. Then I started asking questions about how they would handle certain tasks—even though I had no idea about carpentry myself. What I did know was how to read people, so I watched their responses closely, observing how they acted as they spoke.\nI looked them in the eyes, without breaking eye contact, and evaluated whether they responded with confidence, showed nervousness, or simply rushed to give me an answer. Then I looked at their hands, checking for callouses and the toughness of their skin. It was a good sign of experience in manual labor, something I was specifically looking for—hardened hands, not too old, but seasoned enough to endure heavy physical work.\nOnce I selected the ten most promising ones, I took down their names and registered them for future taxation, as was necessary. Then I led them to the sawmill on the outskirts of the village, though unfortunately, it wasn't mine. It belonged to one of the local notables. That meant I couldn't cut costs simply by taking over the production.\n\"Are you in charge?\" I asked, staring directly at the foreman.\n\"Yes, my lord... How can this humble subject be of service?\" he answered quickly, almost immediately upon seeing me approach.\n\"I need oak planks,\" I said, eyeing the large number of logs stacked in the yard.\n\"Nine pennies per plank, my lord,\" the foreman stated, not missing a beat as he glanced at his workers.\n\"I'm going to buy a large amount, so I'll offer six per plank,\" I said, fixing my gaze on the foreman, leaving no room for doubt.\nThe foreman hesitated for a moment, looking at me with slight surprise.\n\"I don't think I have permission to do that...\" he tried to say, somewhat unsure, as if the price I had offered were out of line.\nI stepped closer and leaned in slightly, revealing the insignia of my family on my garments.\n\"Do you know who owns the forests you're cutting down?\" I asked firmly, my hands resting over my abdomen as I pointed to the family heraldry—a clear reminder of who controlled these lands.\nThe foreman stayed silent for a moment, nervous about the proposal, but eventually spoke. \"The master... might fire me if I make a deal without his permission,\" he said, clearly uncertain.\nI looked at him steadily, keeping calm. \"I'm going to buy a huge amount of product—possibly more than you can even produce. I believe your master would be pleased with a steady deal with the lord of these lands. And if he has a problem with it, he can come speak to me directly,\" I replied, my voice firm and confident.\nThe foreman, seeing my determination, slowly nodded. \"Six pennies then, my lord,\" he said, lowering his head. \"How much will you be buying?\"\nI glanced at the group of workers behind me. \"As much as they can use in a full day's work,\" I said, gesturing toward the men who were already starting the tasks I had assigned.\n\"Send me the bill at the end of each day, and I'll pay it immediately... Any issue with them working here? It'll be faster this way,\" I asked, with a calm but direct tone.\n\"No... no problem, my lord,\" said the foreman, sighing with relief as if the tension had finally lifted.\n\"Good. Send me the amount at day's end, or if your master prefers, I'll pay him directly when he arrives,\" I added, returning to my horse and mounting firmly. \"In any case, I appreciate your time,\" I finished, beginning to ride off toward my next destination.\nRiding through the village, I observed that everything continued as usual. The locals went about their daily tasks, and nothing had changed much since the last time I had passed through. The streets were calm, with peasants working in the fields and merchants handling their affairs with no sign of unrest. There wasn't much that caught my attention—only the reassurance that everything was running as it should.\nI made my way quickly toward the bridge that led directly to Marienburg, passing through several settlements before reaching the great trade city. Although most merchants used ships to move their goods, the overland route I was on was the only one directly connected to Altdorf. It was a key point of exchange, and I intended to make full use of it.\nWhen I arrived at the area where the soapmakers were working, I could see the production process was progressing well. Animal fat was melting in large pots, and the workers were pouring the mixture into molds. A large heap of fat surrounded them, being processed without rest. The sun was shining, helping some of the molds begin to dry, a clear sign of the effort being put into production.\nI turned my gaze toward the blacksmiths working nearby. The land where the furnaces would be built was already prepared. The stone and clay foundations were being formed. There were more smiths now than the day before, a clear indication that the workforce had increased. They were shaping the towers of stone that would become the kilns. Men moved rocks and chiseled them carefully to ensure the proper size and alignment of the structure.\nI made sure everything was in order before heading back to the village—my inspection for the day was done. I already had my next steps in mind. It was time to negotiate with the priests of Shallya and see how they could be part of this new cycle of production and commerce. I also had to think about how to keep increasing my income rapidly, calculating my next moves to ensure I could maximize the gold I might generate from all these processes.\nI returned to the village swiftly, my mind already focused on the day's tasks. I made my way to the chapel of Shallya, a modest wooden building with stone foundations located on the outskirts of the village, far from the noise of the town center. The setting was peaceful, and the tranquility of the place reflected in both its architecture and its atmosphere. There were no noises—only the gentle rustling of leaves stirred by the wind. As I approached, I saw the white dove—the symbol of the White Lady—carved above the entrance.\nCrossing the threshold, I was greeted by the strong, soothing scent of healing oils and medicinal herbs. Inside, the space was filled with beds—some occupied by injured peasants, others by women close to childbirth. The atmosphere was serene, but charged with the constant need for care brought by those seeking comfort and healing in the chapel.\nAs I watched the patients and the staff moving about, a priestess who had just finished bandaging a peasant noticed me. Upon seeing me, she offered a deep and warm look—one that contrasted with the tension of the place. Her face radiated sincerity, a genuine kindness that made me feel, for a brief moment, as if everything I had lived through was fading away, replaced by unexpected calm.\n\"Young lord, the temple of the White Maiden prays for you each day. May Shallya, protector of the humble, return in health and harmony what you give with such heart. You are the reflection of her mercy upon this land,\" she said respectfully, her voice calm but full of deep gratitude.\n\"Well, I do give them a lot of gold every year—it's only natural they'd want to kiss my feet,\" I thought to myself, though I kept my expression serene.\n\"I thank the servants of the White Lady for their concern,\" I replied, in a formal but respectful tone, aware of the delicacy with which I needed to handle such matters. \"I hope I may ask for a few minutes of your time to discuss something.\"\nThe priestess looked at me carefully, as if weighing my words, before nodding softly with a genuine smile.\n\"Of course, young lord,\" she said kindly. \"Here, we are all servants of Shallya, and our efforts are always at the disposal of those who serve the cause of well-being. Please, follow me. We have a more private room where we can speak in peace,\" she said, gesturing gently for me to follow.\nAs we walked deeper into the chapel, I saw more closely the work being done: beds covered in blankets, each with wounded individuals or women in labor, and tables filled with ointments, dried herbs, and small medical tools—all neatly organized with care and precision. It was a sanctuary of healing, where inner peace was reflected in the dedication of those who worked there.\nThe priestess led me to a small room, separated from the patients who needed immediate attention. It was a cozy space, with a wooden desk covered in scrolls and a few open books. The air carried a softer scent of oils and dry herbs.\n\"Now, my lord, how may I assist you?\" the priestess asked, looking up as she took a seat across from me, ready to listen.\n\"I see you're busy, so I'll get straight to the point, if you don't mind,\" I said bluntly, careful not to sound disrespectful. \"I'm producing soap, and I figured the White Lady would be the first interested in acquiring it to continue your care for the needy.\"\nThe priestess studied me in silence for a moment, as if digesting my words. Her face remained calm, but there was a new attentiveness in her gaze. Then she nodded, offering a soft smile that acknowledged the weight of my proposal.\n\"Soap, you say?\" she murmured, her voice calm and understanding. \"The White Lady has always stood beside those who suffer most. We tend to bodies and souls, but hygiene is a fundamental part of care. Soap doesn't just clean — it prevents illness and protects the weak. Your offer is certainly of value.\"\nShe paused briefly, thoughtful. \"This isn't just about the product, but about the intention behind it. And it seems you understand the importance of serving those in greatest need. If it can reach the homes of the poor, it will be a meaningful change — something we could incorporate into our daily work.\"\nHer tone grew warmer, more interested. \"How much do you plan to produce? And in what form?\"\n'I wasn't expecting a yes that quickly,' I thought.\n\"If my calculations are correct, I should have a hundred kilos ready tomorrow. Cut into one-hundred-gram bars — that's a thousand units. Market price: one silver shilling per bar,\" I answered plainly.\nShe nodded slowly, maintaining her calm demeanor. But I noticed a different light in her eyes: interest, perhaps even enthusiasm.\n\"A thousand bars a day… that's a good start,\" she said, gently touching her chin. \"If you can keep up that production and maintain consistent quality, we could begin distributing immediately. And if it works well, demand will increase. The White Lady blesses every effort that heals, soothes, or prevents suffering.\"\nShe looked at me again, more firmly. \"The price seems fair. It could be the right starting point — as long as it remains accessible for those who truly need it.\"\n\"That's exactly my aim,\" I replied without hesitation. \"To make it accessible for everyone — especially those homes with nothing but their faith and their hands. This isn't just about selling, it's about preventing disease. A useful investment.\"\nShe smiled, with that expression that blends faith with hope… or at least I chose to believe so. Though inwardly, I couldn't help thinking she appreciated how easily I lied to her face.\n\"That's what we like to hear,\" she replied softly. \"This may be an important first step. Shallya watches over those who care for others. Our chapel will support you — we'll buy and distribute the soap in our centers and in the homes where misery still lingers.\"\n\"You'll have your shipment tomorrow. If you'll excuse me, I'll take my leave,\" I said, offering a slight bow.\nShe simply smiled, and I left… a bit uneasy. I wasn't used to dealing with people who showed genuine concern for strangers they didn't even know.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

To maintain my daily soap production, I needed a hundred kilos of animal fat per day. My hunters could only supply a quarter of that. Even though I had granted them free hunting rights across my forests—lush with life thanks to my father's careful stewardship—it still wasn't enough. Deer, boars, and other wild animals were abundant, but they couldn't meet the fat demand.\nAt most, the peasants sold me some fat when they slaughtered a pig, but by the time they offered it, it was already turning rancid. That gave me around ten kilos a day. I was still missing at least seventy kilos to keep the process stable.\nThe solution was to buy pigs from local breeders. Each cost eight crowns, and to make up for the missing fat, I had to buy three daily. This cut into my profit margins, but even so, a 50% return by turning fat into soap was still a profitable venture. In the end, I spent 24.5 crowns a day on pigs, but earned 50 in return. Not bad… just not ideal.\nWhat frustrated me the most was that the meat had no use. The local merchants only brought in enough salt for village consumption, and if I bought it all up, I'd deprive the entire village—risking a revolt I had no intention of provoking.\nIn the end, I resigned myself to donating the pork to the villagers. No one here bought meat, there were no butchers, and everything was for personal consumption. The average income was so low that no one could afford it. So, though it pained me to give it away, I had no better option. The castle servants removed the fat and then chopped the meat into edible portions, which were distributed to the townspeople. At least this way, no one went hungry, and I didn't lose everything in the process.\nAt first, it was just a rumor whispered among the closer households. But soon, news of free pork spread like wildfire. What began as a small act to ease some of the townsfolk's burdens quickly turned into a massive line of people waiting patiently for my so-called \"charity.\"\nTo ensure fair distribution and prevent hoarding, I decided to limit the rations to one kilogram per person. This kept things relatively organized, though the line only kept growing. During that wait, I made sure to be there, at the heart of it all, tying my image to generosity. It was a political gesture I disliked, but I understood the necessity of appearing close to the people.\nSo, with the fake smile of a campaigning politician, I found myself forced to speak gently, pretending I cared about their lives, about their struggles. Every person who approached, every eye that met mine, reminded me what I needed to project: a generous noble, compassionate and willing to sacrifice for his people. It was harder than I expected, but a mask I needed to wear.\nMinutes passed and the line only grew. The patience of the people was impressive, and there I stood, smiling, thanking them for their gratitude—though inwardly, I longed for it all to end.\nThat was when the priestess of Shallya appeared, accompanied by several members of her order. They all walked with radiant smiles, as if their very presence brought the peace and calm they so often preached. I watched them approach with some discomfort.\n\"The weirdos have arrived,\" I muttered under my breath, noting their simple yet immaculate robes, like figures plucked straight from a holy painting.\nThe priestess, in her pristine white gown and crown of Shallya flowers upon her head, walked toward me with firm steps. The others followed closely, each carrying a box.\n\"My lord,\" the priestess began, her voice gentle, maternal, yet steady. \"We see that you are making a noble act of generosity today. Shallya smiles upon your efforts. It brings us joy to witness someone of your standing offer help so directly to their people.\"\n\"Thank you, priestess,\" I replied, keeping a polite smile while glancing at her followers. \"I'm doing what I can. The people need help, and this is just a small gesture.\"\n\"A meaningful one, my lord—one that speaks to your compassion,\" she said, stepping closer. \"As you surely know, this act isn't only about helping the poor, but also about connecting with them, building a bond that will grow over time. Our goddess offers the needy her care, and there is no greater beauty than aiding those who suffer.\"\n\"And to what do I owe the honor of your presence, priestess, considering the importance of your work?\" I asked, maintaining a courteous smile while keeping my gaze fixed on her. The warmth in her face and the serenity in her voice never failed to impress, even amidst the clamor of the crowd.\n\"Recently, we purchased soap from a great benefactor of the Cult of the White Lady. We thought this would be a perfect opportunity to spread Shallya's blessings to all those in need gathered here,\" said the priestess, raising her voice so everyone present could hear.\n\"Please, feel free to do so,\" I replied, motioning politely toward the line of people patiently waiting for their share of pork, all while smiling. Despite the tension in the air, my voice sounded warm and genuine, trying to keep everything moving smoothly.\nThe priestess and her group began distributing the soap with near-devotional dedication, speaking to the people about the mercy of Shallya and the meaning of giving to those less fortunate. I couldn't help but think how exhausting it must be to maintain a constant smile, like a mask. Smiling all the time, being the good ruler… it sounded easy in theory, but it was utterly draining.\nSuddenly, the sound of galloping hooves tore through my thoughts. One of my guards approached at full speed, visibly shaken.\n\"My lord, greenskins are attacking a trade caravan coming from Marienburg,\" the guard reported, breathless from the run.\n\"Well… that's bad,\" I muttered, frowning as I noticed the murmuring in the crowd growing rapidly. The news had spread like wildfire. No surprise there—orc tribes were always a lurking threat on the frontier.\n\"Mobilize the local guards, keep the bridge under watch,\" I ordered quickly, my voice firm and in control. There was no time to waste.\nI rose to my feet, finding in this situation the perfect excuse to escape the crowd swarming around the priests of the Shallya weirdos.\n\"I'm going to oversee the defense post. Let Shallya's folk tend to their people,\" I said.\nI had no idea how many orks were attacking, and as always, it was smartest to prepare for the worst. The key was to get into a defensive position and assess from there. As I watched my guards prepare for battle, I couldn't ignore the uneven quality of their gear. Most wore only chainmail, some had steel breastplates, and others had mismatched armor pieces clearly acquired from various sources. The guards were far from standardized, unlike the Margrave's army, where every piece of equipment matched. Here, improvisation was the rule—and it made me uneasy. My dwarven arquebus was, without a doubt, the best weapon in the garrison.\nThe good news was that the mobilization of my two hundred men was quick, since they were already patrolling the village, allowing them to reach the bridge in little time. I didn't need to organize the troops—the work had already been done.\nIf the orks managed to cross the river, they would throw the town into panic, and I couldn't allow that. I needed to move, observe, and decide based on how many orks there were.\nWe headed toward the bridge, with the cavalry at the front, ready to intercept any attack. The tension grew as we approached the edge of my domain. I had to ensure the orks would go no further.\nFinally, after several minutes, we found them. The sound of battle was clear in the distance—a cacophony of screams, clashing metal, and savage roars. The caravan guards clung to the wagons like makeshift walls, holding the line, but their strength was starting to fail. Though they were holding for now, the green brutes were overwhelming them. I saw a group of orks moving back and forth with terrifying ease, fighting with fury, oblivious to our approaching forces.\n\"Those things are huge…\" one of my guards muttered, his face a mix of fear and awe.\n\"Crossbowmen to the front, halberdiers behind, loose formation,\" I commanded, my voice ringing with authority. The crossbowmen moved into position, and the first group of forty guards advanced, preparing to fire their bolts at the orcs, who were less than a hundred meters away.\nThe first volley struck true. At least three orcs dropped immediately, collapsing into the dust. The crossbowmen reloaded quickly.\nThen the orcs, finally aware of our presence, turned toward us with fury.\n\"WAAAAAAGH!\" they roared, a brutal war cry.\n\"Crossbowmen, fall back! Halberdiers, forward!\" I shouted, watching as the soldiers advanced and the orcs charged. The crossbowmen retreated, slipping through the gaps in our formation with some disorder but eventually regrouping.\nAt that moment, the first line of halberdiers planted their feet, forming three tight ranks. A wall of iron and steel stood ready to receive the orcish charge. Their war cries surrounded us, their rage palpable in the tremors their charge left on the ground.\nSweat beaded on my brow as I raised my arquebus. My eyes locked onto the orc leader—a towering green-skinned giant covered in scars, standing out clearly among the others.\nI took a breath, aimed, and fired.\nThe orc leader's head exploded in a red mist of blood and flesh. The blast of my shot was quickly drowned by the roar of the remaining orcs who, upon seeing their leader fall… began to flee.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\n\"Don't let the bastards escape,\" I snarled, spurring my horse as I finished reloading the arquebus.\nThe rest of the cavalry followed, charging into the retreating orcs, many of whom were impaled by lances or trampled beneath hooves.\nWe continued the pursuit until the last of the orcs lay dead. After the fighting ended, I gave the order to gather the bodies and burn them before they could start spreading spores—and to burn the surrounding area, just to be safe.\n\"These orcs are more cowardly than they look,\" I said, returning with the rest of my men.\n\"I think you killed their leader, my lord… and once they saw they were outnumbered, all they could do was run,\" said one of my riders beside me.\n\"Good. Let's see who the lucky ones are,\" I said, looking toward the survivors of the large caravan.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

And may Manann keep the waters of your fortune calm,\" said a man dressed in extravagantly colorful clothing, standing out among the merchants and guards gathered.\n\"Manann… Marienburg, then?\" I replied, studying the presence of more merchants among them, as their guards began tending to the many wounded.\n\"Exactly... it's surprising that a child—\" the merchant began, but I cut him off before he could finish.\n\"Finish that sentence and I'll have your tongue cut out. Then I'll make you march across my lands with it missing,\" I said, my tone sharp and unyielding.\nThe merchant swallowed hard, his face paling, and before he could say another word, one of the other merchants struck him on the head, silencing him immediately.\n\"Apologies, milord... my nephew is a fool. Thank you for your mercy in not executing him on the spot,\" said the older man, bowing his head and forcing the younger merchant to do the same. The tension in the air was thick, but something in their behavior told me the punishment, though harsh, was warranted.\n\"Why such a large caravan?\" I asked, eyeing the group. \"Wouldn't it be safer to travel by ship to Schilderheim, to avoid these kinds of problems with the orcs?\"\n\"For safety, milord. We have no ships, and it isn't profitable to pay a captain to take us to Altdorf. Between the cost of the voyage and Schilderheim's tax, there wouldn't be much profit left. That's why a large group of merchants travel together—to pass through these lands with as much safety as possible. Bandits rarely attack unless they're in numbers, which is uncommon… But orcs—they strike without concern for consequence,\" the older merchant explained, still keeping his head low.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"Seems like you weren't very lucky…\" I said, glancing at the group still mourning their dead. \"If you find it necessary, you may bury your dead in Morr's temple within my lands. Though I must warn you: you'll have to pay for the rites—I only cover the expenses for my own people,\" I said as I began to move my horse.\n\"Many thanks, milord. Might I ask… are you the Baron of Reinsfeld?\" the merchant asked, with a glimmer of hope in his eyes.\n\"I am… my father passed away a few days ago,\" I replied, looking directly at the merchant. His surprise was clear.\n\"As it happens, I had a contract with your father to buy iron ore…\" the merchant began, his voice more cautious now.\n\"Ah, yes, I remember,\" I said, without changing my expression, watching his face shift. \"That scam,\" I added, watching his features turn stern.\n\"With all due respect, milord... that was the market price... in Nuln, they only paid me one more crown for transporting it…\" the merchant replied, regaining his composure as he met my gaze.\n\"Well... I have no intention of continuing that deal,\" I said. \"I now have a large group of blacksmiths processing that iron into tools. If you're interested, we can negotiate something regarding buying the tools—but forget the ore deal,\" I added, turning toward my men as I started to leave the group behind.\nReturning to my men, I addressed the riders who were already ready to depart.\n\"I need you to scout the area… but proceed carefully. Don't take unnecessary risks. Above all, track where the greenskins are running to—it's possible they have a nearby camp. I highly doubt this was a direct attack from the mountains. Between the trip out and the way back, you'll lose the whole day, so don't rush,\" I said with a firm tone, and the riders immediately nodded.\nWith the orders given, they quickly dispersed to investigate where the orc camp might be located.\nI began heading back with the rest of the men, leaving about two dozen guards behind to burn the orc corpses. The march was long, and the heavy caravan of merchants trailed closely behind us, clearly viewing us as a free escort all the way to Reinsfeld.\nAs we were about to arrive, I was greeted by a thick column of black smoke rising into the sky. Under normal circumstances, I might have assumed it was a fire—but something about that smoke told me exactly what it was. It wasn't a fire, but a sign that something much more important was happening.\nWhen we reached the bridge, my eyes were immediately drawn to the massive activity unfolding before me. My investment in blacksmiths had started to bear fruit. More than sixty blacksmiths were working tirelessly to turn iron ore into wrought iron, each with a specific task in this impressive production chain. Some were hammering the ore with massive mallets, while others distributed the loads among the furnaces, filling them with charcoal to heat them up. The sound of hammers striking metal filled the air—a rhythmic melody of constant labor.\nI moved closer and saw some blacksmiths hammering the iron to purge its impurities, sweat streaming down their faces as the fire's heat enveloped them. The young blacksmiths, many of them with hands hardened by years of work, moved with impressive skill.\nThe furnaces, now filled with ore and charcoal, were blazing hot. The heat radiating from them was intense, the air thick and heavy, but the blacksmiths didn't stop. They were fully focused on the process, on creating the metal that would soon become tools, weapons, and hopefully, a new source of income for my domain.\nI stood there for a moment, watching how teamwork, organization, and the skill of my men were producing results.\nWith the sound of hammers ringing in my ears, I turned and approached one of the more experienced blacksmiths. I gave him an evaluating look, making sure everything was in order.\nOnce the axe head was finally ready, a smith began sharpening it with a whetstone, his hand steady and practiced. Then, with precision, he fitted it onto a wooden handle, securing it tightly with a wedge. He gave it a few pulls to test its firmness—perfectly set, as if the handle had been made for that exact head. It wasn't long before the blacksmith offered me the axe, bowing his head respectfully and presenting it with both hands, awaiting my approval.\nI took the axe in one hand, feeling the weight of the handle. It was a bit big for me now, but I was still young. For an adult, the tool would be perfect. The edge was impressive—sharp and straight. I ran my fingers gently along the blade, noting how keen it was. I swung it a few times, assessing the balance. Not perfect, but more than fit for purpose. It would chop trees well, and that was all that mattered.\nI nodded and handed it back. The smith accepted it with pride and carefully placed it in a wooden crate already filled with freshly forged axes. Production was moving fast, and I could see the tools piling up, ready for distribution.\n\"Impressive,\" said the old merchant who had once dealt with my father, watching the busy workshop. \"Last time I came through here, none of this existed. And now, so many blacksmiths working...\"\n\"Progress,\" I replied with a hint of satisfaction. \"Better to process the iron ourselves and profit here than send it all to Nuln and let them take every last crown,\" I added, pride in my voice as I surveyed the industrious forge.\n\"Speaking of business…\" said the merchant.\n\"Yes, speaking of business…\" I began confidently. \"I must inform you that Emperor Luitpold von Holswig-Schliestein, in his infinite wisdom, has granted my house the right to collect tolls for crossing the road bridge. I see you've already crossed it… haven't you? Well, as you've crossed, the toll must be paid.\" I smiled.\nThe merchants fell silent, tension tightening their expressions. It was clear they didn't like the news.\n\"I wasn't informed of this…\" said one of them, visibly irritated.\n\"Ignorance of the law does not exempt one from compliance,\" I replied curtly, leaving no room for argument. Though I knew the toll wouldn't amount to more than ten crowns—a trivial sum\n\"But today, I feel merciful... So, just this once, I'll waive the fee, considering what you've suffered today,\" I added with a friendly-enough smile as I dismounted.\nThe merchants, visibly relieved, began to relax slightly, though they still wandered around my makeshift industrial zone, examining everything with greedy interest.\n\"Baron von Reinsfeld… May I speak with you, young lord?\" asked one older merchant, pulling out a document sealed with my family's crest.\n\"Of course. What is it about?\" I asked, folding my arms like I had all the time in the world.\n\"As I mentioned earlier, your father and I had an agreement for the price of iron ore…\" said the merchant, holding up the document nervously, as if it were his last hope.\n\"And I told you I won't honor it,\" I answered with a smile, calm and direct.\n\"That could affect your family's honor… it could even bring you to—\" he began, but I cut him off.\n\"Court? I have more than enough gold to bribe the judge and have your claim dismissed. You'd be labeled a liar and hanged for attempting to slander an innocent noble… Because we both know you don't have the gold to bribe a judge. Ha, ha, ha.\" I smiled as I spoke, savoring every word as I watched his face fall.\nThe merchant swallowed hard, visibly shaken. \"Milord… I invested heavily in buying more wagons and horses to transport ore to Nuln. I poured nearly my entire family's fortune into this. Without the contract, I'm ruined,\" he confessed, breathing unevenly.\n\"Oh… desperate, are we?\" I said, watching him bite his lip, regretting his honesty.\n\"Look… I need someone to handle a very specific task. Take my goods to market and find buyers. I could deal with nobles, but I'm not suited to handle merchants, artisans, or peasants. So I might need the services of someone desperate,\" I said, my tone smooth, my smile confident.\n\"Milord… I have a contract with a forge in Nuln. If I break it, I'll owe a heavy penalty. I could at least cover it with fifty crowns,\" said the merchant, nearly crushed by the weight of his situation.\n\"Really? Let me see the contract,\" I said, watching him hesitate and chew his lip again.\n\"You're lying to me… Now, I'd be insulted if a Marienburg merchant don't try to fool me. So here's the deal: I'll fill your wagons, feed your horses, and give you 5% of the profits. Yes, I know, I'm generous. You handle the transportation and sales. And… I'll pay all the taxes you incur to make the deal even more profitable,\" I offered confidently, knowing I had him cornered.\n\"And this one, you'll honor?\" the merchant asked bitterly.\n\"Are you calling me a liar?\" I replied, removing my glove and snapping my fingers. I pointed at him, and my guards immediately reached for their weapons and surrounded him.\n\"No... no... please,\" he stammered, stepping back in panic.\nHe had cracked.\nI raised my hand, and my guards stopped.\n\"Forgive me. I must have misunderstood… I have that tendency, hahaha,\" I laughed lightly.\nThe merchant exhaled in defeat. \"Yes, milord… so what products will I be dealing with?\"\n\"For now, soap and tools,\" I said, pointing toward the soapmakers and blacksmiths.\n\"And how much do you produce…?\" he asked, pulling out an abacus.\n\"One thousand bars of soap daily. As for the blacksmiths, I'm still gauging their output—but feel free to ask them directly. I just need you to sell the goods. Oh, and I'll be sending some of my men with you… Not that I don't trust you—I really don't. So behave,\" I said, pointing at him.\n\"Don't worry, milord… Hoes… hoes sell well,\" said the merchant as he walked toward the blacksmiths.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

With so much work to do and so little time to enjoy any peace, I found myself constantly busy—always looking for new ways to generate income and making sure the operations across my domain continued smoothly.\nMy new slav—assistant from Marienburg spent several days waiting to gather enough goods to fill the wagons he had brought. Progress was slower than expected, but we finally managed to load the carts with axes, hoes, shovels, and most importantly, soap. I had started producing mint soap—something I hadn't originally planned, but which, thanks to some observations from my guards, turned into a good opportunity. While exploring the surrounding area, they had found large amounts of wild mint. At first, I wasn't sure what to do with it, but then I thought it might be useful to add fragrance to the soap.\nThe orc camp we had been searching for was already abandoned by the time we found it. There was no trace of the greenskins left, just piles of filth and discarded waste. I wasn't willing to risk ork spores spreading, so I ordered everything burned. I needed to prevent the threat from returning in the future—and for that, I had to act fast. Waiting until next year would mean allowing the orks to grow stronger. I needed to strike when they were at their weakest.\nMeanwhile, the mint soap was being made by drying and grinding the herb before cooking it with the rendered fat. Though I wasn't entirely sure if the mint's properties actually transferred to the soap by boiling it with the triglycerides from the fat, the scent was subtle, refreshing, and likely to help it sell at a higher price. According to the Marienburger merchant, scented soap fetched a much better price. So over time, we ramped up production and prepared to sell it in nearby towns.\nAs for the blacksmiths, they were producing between 140 and 200 tools a day, depending on what I asked for. Hoes were easier to make than shovels or axes and sold for 6 silver shillings, so they were produced much faster. Though not extremely lucrative, each hoe had a profit margin of around 50%. Axes, on the other hand, were more expensive and required more work, but brought in better returns—8 shillings apiece, with a profit margin of 60% after factoring in material and labor costs.\nAs the days went by, I launched another strong publicity campaign in the village, using the popularity of the free pork meat distribution that had become a regular event. The priestess of Shallya, along with other members of her cult, began handing out bread and soap to the townsfolk. Crowds gathered daily in front of the castle hoping to receive something. Taking advantage of this, I offered 100 lumberjack jobs at a wage of one shilling per day. It was a job that required no real skill—just muscle—so the village youth jumped at the opportunity.\nNow, instead of struggling to find labor, I could choose the best. Equipped with the freshly made axes, the woodcutters began felling large numbers of trees. By clearing trees near the city and roads, I ensured that if the beastmen ever returned, we wouldn't be as exposed as before. Keeping forests away from trade routes was essential to prevent ambushes.\nMy father had been so efficient in hunting beastmen that they only appeared now when a mutated child was born among the peasants—but even so, I preferred to keep precautions at their highest.\nThe wood we harvested wasn't just used to make charcoal for the iron furnaces—it also went into producing planks. Instead of sending it to a sawmill, I invested in two two-man saws and put the lumberjacks to work processing the timber. Often, they ruined parts of the material, but that wasn't a major problem. Damaged wood could still be turned into charcoal, which remained useful. Besides, the more skilled the lumberjacks became, the better the results over time.\nEventually, wood production would increase. If we managed to establish an efficient workflow, we could forge nails and hammers and kick off a wave of construction. But before making any major investments, I needed to ensure we had the funds to support such projects sustainably.\nAs for the timber, I also began considering something potentially very profitable: paper production. Making cellulose paper from wood wasn't complicated, but the real problem was the lignin. This compound left the paper yellowish, which reduced its commercial value and made it far less appealing. The real difficulty lay in the bleaching process, which required chemicals like chlorine—a dangerous and expensive procedure. The risk of inhaling the chemicals was high, and if one of my peasants ever poured chlorinated water into the river, it could contaminate the entire water supply for Reinsfeld.\nSo, for the first time, I chose the more expensive and less efficient route: producing rag paper from linen cloth. This method came with its own difficulties. Obtaining used linen rags wasn't easy. And the issue was how to acquire them without hurting my public image. Asking for old clothes or trying to buy them looked bad. Using new linen was out of the question—it would double or even triple production time. Between soaking the rags, beating them with hammers, pressing, drying, coating them with gelatin, and pressing again, the process would already take around ten days. With new linen, it could take twice as long—or more.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nSo I decided to visit the town carpenter to help me build the presses needed for the paper-making process. I handed him some rough sketches with the specifications, explaining how the presses and the iron mesh frames should be constructed. He accepted the job, though he charged me fifteen crowns to build them—and truthfully, they probably wouldn't work, since even I wasn't entirely sure how a press functioned. I only knew I needed one.\nOn the other hand, I decided to ask a favor of the Temple of Shallya. They had close interaction with the local community, especially through their charitable distributions. I asked them to collect old clothes and used rags whenever they handed out food or aid to the needy. That would allow me to gather enough linen to begin the paper-making process. While I waited, they could collect the rags, and I could start preparing everything else.\nAs I was deep in thought, one of my men-at-arms approached and caught my attention. I noticed how the peasants were beginning to fill baskets with pork and black bread, while leaving old clothing in the empty bins.\n\"My lord…\" he whispered.\n\"Speak,\" I replied, shaking off my thoughts and focusing on him.\n\"We've spotted a large group of people approaching on the road. Many of them are armed,\" he whispered close to my ear.\n\"Call the guards… but don't raise alarm,\" I said, standing and quickly grabbing my arquebus.\nIn silence, all available guards prepared for combat. This time, the warning had been delivered calmly—If there are no screams, no one needs to panic.—unlike when someone had yelled about orks and thrown the entire town into chaos.\nI approached my men and formed a defensive line. I knew the approaching group outnumbered us. The silence among my guards was heavy. The sound of marching feet grew louder—until it stopped. Tension hung thick in the air.\nI saw an enormous host of armed men, almost like a provincial regiment. I spotted swordsmen, spearmen, and crossbowmen. But just like us, they remained still.\nMy crossbowmen prepared to fire. But then something caught my eye. Among the armed men were women and children, and that changed everything.\n\"Hold... Hold!\" I shouted, riding forward and tightening my reins. I stopped, examining the group more closely. We had to be cautious.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar,\" I said, making the two-tailed comet gesture.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar,\" replied a man with an eye patch, returning the same gesture.\n\"May I ask, good men of the Empire, what brings you to my lands armed?\" I said as I moved my horse, observing the large group—easily over a thousand strong.\n\"Uh… by decree of the Emperor… there are lands here ready for settlement,\" said the one-eyed man, speaking seriously.\n\"And the weapons?\" I asked, eyeing him with some suspicion.\n\"For safety… and well… we're veterans from a state regiment in Talabecland. These are our own arms,\" he replied, more confident this time and visibly calmer.\n\"Indeed. I am the Baron of Reinsfeld. According to His Imperial Majesty, we have lands prepared for settlement… especially for brave servants who have defended the Empire,\" I said, watching their faces with a faint smile.\n\"I thought we'd never get here,\" said the veteran, visibly relieved.\n\"Had a rough journey, soldier?\" I asked, dismounting and walking beside him calmly.\n\"No… most of the way was safe, but they say there are beastmen in these parts. That's what kept us on edge,\" the veteran answered nervously.\n\"Supposedly, there are a few in the deeper forest, but my family does a good job of hunting them down and driving them out completely. The last major beastman sighting was five years ago, and we organize a hunt every year to keep them at bay,\" I said, trying to put him at ease.\n\"That's good to hear,\" said the veteran, and soon word spread among the group. They began nodding or muttering similar things, visibly relieved.\n\"May I ask why you chose to come all the way here? It's quite the journey from Talabecland,\" I asked as we walked together toward my men.\n\"Recently, there was a conflict between noble houses, and several villages were caught in the conflict.\nThe lords we served could no longer afford to pay us. Since the conflict showed no signs of ending soon, we decided to try our luck before spring arrived and risk being trapped in a noble feud,\" explained the veteran.\n\"Understandable… do you have any idea how many you are?\" I asked, preparing to handle the necessary paperwork and record them for future taxes—even if those were ten years away.\nThe veteran returned to the group and came back with a few papers. \"The mayor of our village said these would help. It's the Imperial census,\" said the veteran, handing me the documents.\n\"Excellent… I assume you know how this works? I'll assign each family four hectares of land. For the next ten years, you'll pay no taxes. I'll cover the contributions to the temples of Sigmar, Morr, and Shallya so they can provide aid. But regarding housing… that's your own concern,\" I explained, waiting for his reaction.\n\"We were told about that, my lord…\" he said, clearly nervous.\n\"No need to be nervous, loyal servant of the Empire. In my lands, you are under my protection—and with Sigmar as my witness, I'll do all I can to safeguard you,\" I said, taking his hand and forearm in both of mine, with a reassuring smile.\nJudging by their reactions, it seemed I had played the role of the kind and caring noble rather well… fools.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Unfortunately, this principle hadn't been applied much in Reinsfeld. While the town center and the Sigmarite chapel followed the Empire's usual grid-based layout, the outer areas had spread out in a circular mess, with disconnected streets that required constant detours. So, at the very least, with the new settlers, I had to ensure a more orderly design—something more in line with the Roman system of straight roads and defined zones.\nI took the newcomers to the northern part of the village, where a large section of land had recently been cleared of trees.\n\"This is where you'll build your homes,\" I said, turning around while still holding my horse's reins. \"Eighty square meters per family... any questions?\" I asked, looking at the large crowd of settlers.\n\"Uh... yes, my lord... what's a square meter?\" asked the one-eyed veteran.\n\"Heh... one meter in length by one in width. Eighty total, forming a square. That's the space assigned for each home,\" I explained, pointing at the land.\n\"Bring me the rope,\" I ordered one of the guards, who quickly handed me a hundred-meter-long hemp rope.\nI began marking the 80-meter boundaries with stakes, tying them together with the rope to clearly mark each plot. I had several of my guards do the same, extending the rope and confirming that boundaries were set correctly. As we marked the house plots, we also outlined what would become the future streets of the town.\nOnce several zones were laid out and I had cross-checked them with the imperial census, I started distributing the land.\n\"For now, get yourselves comfortable. The farmland will be handed out next week once I've finished mapping it with my tax collectors to ensure size consistency,\" I informed them, watching as many settlers began pitching tents and digging into the dirt to start building.\n\"You're not going to do what I think you're doing, are you?\" I said, looking at a family who was starting to raise a wall made of plain earth.\n\"Doing what, milord?\" asked the father of the family, visibly confused.\n\"Building with dirt… The rains will ruin it, and it breeds mold, humidity, disease…\" I replied, trying to stay calm, though the sight unsettled me.\n\"I do have a few silver coins, my lord… but I doubt they're enough to build a house,\" the man admitted, lowering his head, visibly worried.\n\"No, no, no…\" I thought, biting my finger. \"This can't happen. I can't allow homes like that to be built. It's a breeding ground for disease, social unrest… and probably an increase in crime. It's not an option.\"\nI paced nervously, trying to find a way to avoid a public health crisis that would cost me more than just making an initial investment.\n\"Shit, shit, I'm going to lose money…\" I murmured, feeling the pressure. But I also knew this was a necessary investment.\n\"Yes… yes, that's it,\" I muttered to myself. \"It's an investment.\"\n\"Gather everyone,\" I ordered, while planning how to solve this mess.\nI waited for the families to gather around me, carefully stepping over the ropes marking each household's lot.\n\"Listen…\" I began, needing to be firm. \"I can't let you live like this. I understand—it's an emergency, you're trying to build houses from dirt. But those conditions are too dangerous. I don't want an epidemic, not in my lands. So… let's do this…\"\nI paused, thinking of the best way to present my solution and avoid resistance.\n\"I will finance the construction of your homes,\" I said at last, my voice firm though I couldn't quite hide my discomfort. \"I'll provide the wood, nails, hammers, bricks, and mortar. But in return, you'll pay rent—monthly. As you stabilize, we'll slowly adjust that rent until you're integrated into the local economy.\"\nI forced a smile, trying to sound convincing as I scanned the faces of the settlers. The midday sun lit the land that would soon become their homes, but doubt was written all over their faces.\n\"Milord… we appreciate your concern, but we don't have anything to pay you with… and we won't know if we do until the first harvest… and we're not even sure we'll be ready for it,\" said one man in patched armor, more concerned with resources than my offer.\n\"Then…\" I replied, letting the idea settle, \"if you give up five years of your tax exemption, that'll cover your first year's rent—and I'll give you the tools you'll need to make sure you're ready for this year's harvest. How does that sound?\"\nI paused again, watching their reactions. I wanted them to see that this was an investment—for them and for me.\n\"Come on… someone… who's going to take the first step?\" I thought, scanning their faces. Several exchanged uncertain glances, waiting for someone else to go first.\n\"I accept, milord,\" said the one-eyed veteran at last, standing firmly. His reply was a relief, and just as I'd hoped, the others began nodding. Some still hesitated, but the pressure was too great—none wanted to be left out.\n\"Good. I'm glad you accept the terms,\" I said, relieved. \"I'll make the arrangements. Set up your tents—but for the love of Sigmar, don't build anything out of dirt!\"\nI said it with a much more relaxed smile before spurring my horse and galloping off toward the forge. Urgency drove every movement, as the situation unfolded rapidly before my eyes. I reached the smithy at full speed, wasting no time.\n\"Kurt! Kurt! Where the hell are you?\" I shouted, my voice nearly lost in the deafening hammering of metal—loud enough to deafen anyone nearby.\n\"Milord!\" Kurt called back, his hands black with grease and soot, quickly wiping them on his blacksmith's apron. \"How can I be of service, good lord?\" he said, bowing his head respectfully.\n\"Do you know how to make the kind of kiln charcoal burners use?\" I asked, a bit frantic from the urgency.\n\"Yes… it's not hard. In fact, I once helped—\" he began, but I cut him off.\n\"Excellent! I need six of them, but modified to dry bricks. And I need them NOW,\" I barked, my tone more commanding now.\n\"Milord… wait… that takes time. The structure must be built carefully. At the very least, I need ten days, and a couple more to cure the interior so it can withstand the heat,\" he explained, clearly concerned by my rushed demand.\n\"I don't have two weeks… damn it! Just build them anyway, near the southern clay deposit. I'll think of something in the meantime… Tell the ones not working on the kilns to start making nails,\" I ordered, bolting toward the lumber camp, where I had most of the workforce.\nAs I rode, I saw a couple of trees crash to the ground, watching the loggers move and take turns chopping the thick trunks. Some were already processing the wood.\nThe lumber camp was a bustling place, full of activity. The men worked without rest, but the pace was uneven. Some were still adjusting to the workload, while others had already mastered the trade.\nThe sound of axes striking wood mingled with the voices of the workers, and the cool morning air filtered through the leaves of the remaining trees. I watched closely as the timber began to pile up, ready for processing.\nI quickly began giving orders for the group of loggers to start working the timber instead of felling more trees, as had been the original task. I didn't just need the forest cleared anymore—I had to make use of the wood they had already cut, turning it into planks and beams. I organized them into pairs with two-man saws, so they could work faster and produce the necessary lumber for the settlers' homes.\n\"Alright, the only viable option now is to wait for the bricks. So, starting with the wooden framework will be the priority for now. Once we have bricks… mortar… Cement's out of the question. We need temperatures our kilns can't reach, but lime mortar… that's more feasible. It's far more accessible than anything else,\" I muttered, thinking through the next steps.\n\"Right, we need to find limestone. Now,\" I told myself, heading back toward the village to gather materials. Time wasn't on our side, and I couldn't afford to waste any more of it.\nOnce back in the village, I rushed to a local merchant and bought a bottle of wine vinegar—a mild acid, but useful for testing limestone. Without wasting another moment, I ordered all my riders to be on alert throughout the territory, searching for white, yellowish, or even gray stone that could serve for lime production. Meanwhile, I joined the search, heading into the hills near the Grey Mountains—farther than I'd ever gone from Reinsfeld.\nThe landscape was vast, dotted with scattered rocks, and the soil seemed fertile. After several hours of searching, just as I was about to lose hope, I finally saw what I had been looking for: a large, white rock. I approached it cautiously\n\"But just to be sure…\" I muttered to myself, pulling out the bottle of vinegar. I let a few drops fall on the stone, and immediately, the reaction came—gentle bubbling on the surface. \"Yes, limestone,\" I murmured, confirming what I needed.\nI drew my sword and, with swift and precise movements, began using it as a digging tool. If any blacksmith saw me now, they'd probably clutch their head in horror at the sight of someone using a sword as a pickaxe—but I didn't have time for proper tools. I had to be practical.\nI extracted a generous chunk of limestone, carefully wrapped it in my cloak, and headed straight back to the village without delay.\nI returned to the forge, finding it mostly empty, with only a few blacksmiths still working on nails—small piles of forged iron spikes already forming.\n\"Is there anything in that furnace?\" I asked one of the smiths, who was hammering on an anvil near a glowing hot kiln.\n\"Just charcoal, milord… I just cleaned it for the next batch of iron,\" he answered, putting down his work.\n\"Perfect,\" I said, and with one swift motion, tossed the chunk of limestone into the furnace. \"Give me that thing you use to handle iron,\" I said, extending my hand.\nThe smith handed me a large pair of iron tongs, and I began striking the limestone, breaking it into more manageable pieces.\n\"It's already releasing carbon dioxide… Make sure the furnace stays lit for several nights—it has to be fully calcined,\" I said, watching the blacksmith, who stared at me like I was speaking another language.\n\"Just don't let it run out of charcoal or oxygen,\" I added, growing annoyed by his blank look.\n\"The bellows… dammit, you ignor—\" I caught myself before yelling. \"The bellows. Use the bellows. Charcoal and bellows for several days,\" I said, more calmly now.\n\"Yes, milord,\" the blacksmith finally nodded, understanding my instructions.\nI stepped away and tried to calm myself. \"Alright… it's not that bad. They just caught me off guard. I just have to improvise on the fly… and everything will turn out fine,\" I said, slowing my breathing.\nA rider came galloping toward me.\n\"Milord, good news! The blacksmiths you requested from your lands have arrived,\" said the guard, clearly pleased to deliver good news.\n\"What…? No! Damn it, I don't even have a place for them to sleep… No… I'm an idiot,\" I muttered, clutching my head in front of the bewildered guard.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

So focused on the details, making sure everything was under control, and now I found myself completely exposed to this situation. Why had I assumed the settlers would at least be people with some resources and not just simple refugees?\nIf it weren't for the soap sales, thanks to the Temple of Shallya, my treasury would be completely empty. The priestess, with her odd sense of charity, had started buying the soap to distribute in nearby villages. Without that, my coffers would have already run dry—because to this day, I still have less gold than when I first began to govern. Although I was still worried about the lack of financial stability, at least the income flow wasn't entirely negative—just low.\nIn addition, the shipment of tools my father had ordered for mining operations had finally arrived. It was a significant blow to the finances, with the total cost of the shipment nearing 800 crowns. Most of the tools were made of steel—pickaxes, wheelbarrows, and specialized equipment—all necessary to move forward with iron mining. Without these tools, I couldn't continue production or keep the settlers busy.\nFortunately, the new blacksmiths who arrived numbered around forty, which allowed me to assign them to the vacant servant quarters I had emptied to cut costs. The problem was that many of them had been unemployed for years, having long abandoned their dreams of becoming smiths. However, I didn't care much, as long as they had the basic experience. The work they had to do now was simple enough: forging nails for construction or processing limestone.\nI wish I could say I had everything under control, but the reality was quite different. After reflecting, I realized that having more people living here meant more labor force and, in theory, more tax income in the future. The problem was that those taxes wouldn't come right away. With almost two thousand new inhabitants, I would have to invest more in security and in the cults, but I wouldn't receive anything tangible in return—at least not in the short term. The more people arrived, the more expenses I'd have to take on. While this could be seen as a long-term investment, it still worried me deeply.\nThere would be no quick solution. Ever since we started settling, a steady trickle of migrants had been arriving from different parts of the Empire. On the 14th, three hundred from Middenland; on the 16th, fifteen hundred from Nordland; on the 17th, nearly a thousand from the outskirts of Altdorf; and on the 20th, a thousand from Wissenland. So far, no one else had arrived, but it was only a matter of time. Apparently, several counts were spreading the word about the settlement on my lands.\nThe population of Reinsfeld had nearly doubled in the blink of an eye, which led me to make a decision. In talking with Rutger Breeke, the merchant from Marienburg who had been helping me with supplies and payments, I had the idea of asking him to pay for the services of an imperial architect. The cost was five hundred crowns just for the evaluation of the project—not cheap, but I needed the advice of someone experienced. I needed someone who truly knew what they were doing, especially since my goal was to build an efficient sewer system—ideally one that could even withstand the threat of Skaven.\nThe architect arrived two days ago. His name was Otto von Nuln, an imperial architect of great renown. Over those two days, he had been analyzing the land, while I, on the other hand, had to deal with the incoming migrants to prevent them from building with packed earth and to secure the approval of the priest of Sigmar for the construction, with his religious blessing. I managed to convince most of them to be patient—that we would begin construction soon and they shouldn't rush into improvised building. In the meantime, the settlers began raising tents to settle temporarily, while I provided them with basic support and kept them busy working their assigned land. The priest of Sigmar, thankfully, wasn't too difficult to convince; apparently, he had a fondness for me since I was a child and once recited verses from Magnus the Pious by heart.\nA problem that began to emerge, however, was the clear cultural differences between the peoples of the Empire. In Reikland, Sigmar was the supreme god—but that wasn't the case in every province. Middenland and Nordland worshiped Ulric, so it wasn't unusual to see them argue with someone who merely greeted them with \"Sigmar's blessings.\" The people from Talabecland mostly revered Taal, and his wife Rhya. The main issue was that they preferred to remain isolated from others, and they were now requesting a chapel for their own gods to be built near their future homes—even though Reinsfeld already had one.\nI was already considering forcing them to integrate, whether they liked it or not. Under no circumstance would I allow them to form ghettos—that only leads to problems. And more often than not, those ghettos end up demanding special rights or laws just for them. So the best course of action would be to break up the clusters and make them learn to tolerate each other. Or I would give them a reason to.\nOtto proved to be very professional and dedicated. With his team of experts, he had been working on maps and planning how the sewer system for the settlement should function.\n\"So… will it be possible?\" I asked, a bit exhausted from his slow response. I had expected more progress from him—especially considering the price I paid for his services.\nOtto looked up from the plans he'd been studying, his expression clearly showing fatigue. \"It's possible, milord. Not easy—especially since part of the system will have to be built under already urbanized areas—but it is possible. The terrain has certain irregularities, and the solutions we'll need to implement are more expensive than I initially anticipated… but I believe, with time, it will be functional.\"\n\"And how long will it take?\" I asked, frowning. I wasn't willing to wait too long. The settlers' needs were not something I could ignore for much longer.\n\"Depending on the materials and the labor force, I'd say at least ten months before we have a fully functional sewer system,\" Otto replied, as if he'd already done the math.\n\"Ten months?\" I repeated, incredulous. \"That's unacceptable. The settlers need something faster. We can't afford to wait ten months—they'll be in the middle of winter by the time they can start building.\"\nOtto sighed. \"I understand your frustration, my lord. But quick solutions aren't always the most effective. If we rush this, we risk creating a system that's inefficient and prone to failure down the line. I believe it's best to do it right from the start.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, taking a deep breath to calm myself. \"But we can't keep waiting. I need this working as soon as possible. If we don't make progress, tensions in town will rise. And if I've learned anything, it's that when people have too much time on their hands, things tend to spiral out of control.\"\nOtto nodded slowly, seeming to understand the gravity of the situation. \"I'll do everything I can to speed up the process, my lord. I don't want this task to become an obstacle to your plans.\"\n\"Is it possible to build after the sewer system is finished?\" I asked, looking for a way to move forward without sacrificing other projects.\n\"Yes, it's possible,\" Otto answered, nodding slowly. \"But diverting labor toward building homes will delay any other type of work. Resources are limited, and we'll need to prioritize.\"\nI took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the decision. \"Alright, how much will it all cost?\" I asked, knowing the price tag was one of my greatest concerns.\n\"Between the cost of materials—which I'll source in Altdorf—the wages for my crew, and my own fee over the coming months, it would total around thirty thousand gold crowns,\" Otto replied. I felt my stomach twist at the number.\n\"Thirty thousand crowns? What are we doing, building it out of silver?\" I said, clearly stunned and trying to process the size of the sum.\n\"What I'm planning isn't cheap, my lord. We need a massive amount of bricks, mortar, labor—and most of all, to purchase a dwarven pumping system. I'll have to build sedimentation chambers, places for filters, and eventually a zone to handle solid waste, so that the water reaching the Reik River is as clean as possible. And none of that is cheap. Dwarves don't sell anything cheaply, and what I'm asking for will be a work of art,\" Otto explained, his tone serious.\n\"I can provide the bricks and mortar, if necessary,\" I replied, trying to find a way to cut the cost. \"Three thousand bricks a day. I've got some decent kilns that have already been running for two days.\"\n\"Three thousand a day?\" Otto looked at me with clear skepticism. \"And the mortar works? Because if it doesn't, all the work will go to waste. It's better to play it safe and buy from professionals.\"\n\"The mortar is under control,\" I answered confidently. \"I made it myself.\"\n\"You made it?\" Otto frowned, clearly doubtful. \"My crew is five hundred workers, my lord. It wouldn't make sense to have them laying six bricks a day. I need at least ten thousand per day to keep up the pace. Plus, I have to stagger the work with digging the tunnels.\" He paused, sighing. \"I doubt a noble knows how to make proper mortar.\"\nMy patience was running thin. \"It's not that difficult,\" I muttered to myself, rummaging for the sack of mortar I had prepared.\n\"What you need is calcium oxide mixed with sand in the right proportion,\" I continued murmuring, unable to hide my irritation. \"That's all it takes. Add a bit of water and you've got perfect mortar.\"\nI returned quickly with the sack and set it down in front of Otto. He opened it with a small blade and took a sample. He poured it into a bucket and began mixing it with water, watching in silence.\nAfter a few minutes, Otto looked up, visibly impressed. \"Interesting,\" he murmured, touching the mixture with his gloved fingers and observing how it hardened. \"The result is impressive... I must admit, I didn't expect this. This mortar will work just fine.\"\n\"Start digging the tunnels you need. I'll make sure to have fifteen thousand bricks per day ready for you in ten days. Sound good?\" I said, looking at the architect.\n\"Alright. But I think we'll have to add another month to the initial estimate. Also, I still need that dwarven pumping system, so I can reduce the cost to thirteen thousand crowns,\" Otto said.\n\"Fine… that's more tolerable. I'll give you an advance of two thousand crowns. The next payment will come in four months after reviewing the progress, and then a final payment when everything is complete,\" I said, pointing toward ink and parchment.\nThe architect shook his head. \"I don't work like that. I charge for each month worked. Too many nobles have tried to cheat me—cutting me off halfway or near the end of a project just to avoid paying—so I prefer to charge monthly. If the payments stop, the work stops. Simple as that.\"\n\"Alright… I suppose that's more convenient for me anyway. I'll send the first payment of thirteen hundred crowns so you can get started. If you need help with anything, let me know. This has to go well,\" I said, thoughtful.Googlᴇ search No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"It will, my lord, don't worry. Once this is finished, any future expansion will be far cheaper—just a matter of connecting it to the system, and in some cases, adding another pump, which won't be as costly,\" the architect said.\nI nodded and rode back to the castle, deep in thought, wondering how the hell I was going to pay off the massive debt I had just taken on.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I owe twelve times what's currently in the treasury, and with the current income, I barely make it to the end of the month without adding anything new. I've got an extra fifty people mining limestone, a hundred working on clay bricks, and forty blacksmiths... nearly all of the soap profits go straight down the drain in salaries.\nWhat's worse, the income from iron tools has stopped. All production is focused on nails, because that's what we need right now... but the process is slow, maddening... almost useless.\nPaper is still out of the question. The carpenter has no idea what he's doing, and now he's working with the blacksmith just to try and assemble what I asked for. A huge delay. Paper production could be the only real way out of this hole, but that'll have to wait until the presses are ready...\nSo, unless I find gold in the Miracle Mountains or silver buried beneath my feet... I'm left, once again, with no choice but to seize my fate by the horns.\nI didn't want to do it. Because of the risks. Because working with minimal safety precautions will probably leave me with a nasty chemical burn… a truly awful scar… or worse… turn me into the laughingstock of everyone. And who knows when the Margrave will send someone to drag me back… if they find out I've buried my family in debt... no...\nTo hell with precautions.\nI need gold. And I've had this business in mind for days. It's just that my fear of sulfuric acid had held me back. But now it's that or disgrace.\nRutger brought me some of the things I needed from Altdorf… I spent about fifty crowns on essential materials for my craft.\nA copper still. A crucible. A mortar made of volcanic stone. Glazed ceramic flasks. Linen cloth filters. Hand-blown glass bowls.\nAll expensive. Very expensive. Many of them custom-made by specific craftsmen. But Rutger managed to get them fast.\nKurt walked into my office with a serious face while I stared at the door.\n\"My lord… the thing you asked for… it's ready,\" said the young blacksmith, bowing his head as usual.\n\"Good… you may leave. And Kurt… you didn't see anything. Understood?\" I said, locking eyes with him.\n\"Yes, my lord,\" he answered without hesitation, then left to resume his duties.\nI finally stood up. Climbed to the top of the castle's tower. Long ago, one of my ancestors used the place for falconry. But my father thought it a coward's sport… he preferred to kill with his bare hands… so the place had fallen into disuse.\nNow it was my chemistry lab. Primitive…\nGood ventilation. Low fire risk. Thick stone walls.\nI looked over everything I'd requested. A small furnace. Several burners. A good amount of improvised glassware. My clothes waiting for me: heavy brown leather garments, thick gloves, and rags infused with activated charcoal I'd prepared days ago. They would serve as basic filters.\nI got dressed in the daylight. Put on the gloves. Wrapped the cloths over my face. Took a deep breath.\nMy goal was clear: produce Prussian blue.\nLapis lazuli is an incredibly expensive pigment. A few grams are worth dozens or even hundreds of crowns. It's used to dye noble garments, for temple paintings, or portraits of emperors.\nIf I could make it… not only could I sell it. I could refill the treasury. Pay off debts. Invest in paper. Set everything straight.\nOr… I could die burned alive by a mistake. A miscalculation. A moment's hesitation.\nI approached a container filled with vinegar and pulled out a bunch of old nails and rusted iron scraps. They'd been submerged for days, and the liquid had turned dark and dense. I filtered it several times using linen cloths to remove any visible impurities… then poured the liquid into a clay tray and placed it into the furnace.\nI lit the fire with dry wood and kept feeding it until I had a steady flame. I stared for long periods, watching the liquid, waiting for signs. Finally… it began to crystallize.\nWhen the process finished, I carefully removed the tray. Took the crystals to the stone mortar and began grinding them calmly, rotating my arm like a machine. I ground everything down to a fine powder.\n\"Jesse… we need to cook… ha, ha, ha,\" I muttered to myself, laughing alone while I crushed the crystals. A dry, bitter laugh… with a nervous edge.\nIn total, two kilograms of crystal.\nWithout delay, I prepared a second batch. Pulled out another jar of vinegar and iron oxide and repeated the procedure.\nI poured all the powder into the still. Lit the burner strongly. When the fire was roaring and devouring the wood like it had a hunger of its own, I placed the still and ensured everything was in place to capture the condensation.\nI waited patiently, motionless, until the first drop fell into the glass flask.\nSulfuric acid. Impure. Green vitriol…\nFrom two kilograms, I should get about 300 ml of acid, more or less. I placed the receiving flask with a mark I'd made by eye… probably imprecise, but close enough. Imperial alchemists use their own arcane measures. I'm the only lunatic who talks about milliliters and kilograms. That's why, whenever I open my mouth, people look at me like I'm insane.\nI took the thin pieces of wrought iron I'd asked the blacksmiths to make. They were shaped exactly as I needed. I prepped the container. Made sure it was clean. With the acid ready, everything would be easier.\nThe next piece was ferrous sulfate. And now I could make it quickly.\nI repeated the process. This time, using rusted iron directly with the sulfuric acid. It started bubbling instantly. Same process as before… only purer, and faster without the extra vinegar elements.\nWhile that mixture rested, I started working on another essential component: ferrocyanide.\nI lit another burner. Boiled water. When it began to bubble, I poured in a generous amount of ash. Potash had to form with the boiling.\nAs the mixture boiled, I took the leftover iron scraps and began filing them down. Iron powder. It took me nearly an hour of tedious work.\nThe potash was ready. So was the powder.\nI grabbed the crucible. Poured in the potash. Then added nitrogenous materials: dried blood, bits of leather, ground cow horns, iron powder… and my urine. Which I had left to evaporate for a few days. Well hidden. I couldn't let the servants see it—or think I'd lost my mind.\nI placed the crucible over the fire once more. The heat would do its work.\nFinally, I sat down. Allowed myself to relax a little. The most dangerous parts were over.\nFrom the window, I watched over my lands.\nHours had passed, and the sun was beginning to hide behind the mountains. My work continued.\nI approached the crucible and saw that a black mass had formed. It looked perfect.\nI carefully transferred it into a clay container and left it to cool near the window, where some fresh air still flowed. Then I set another pot over the fire and heated water again.\nI turned to the tray where I had left the ferrous sulfate and saw that it had completely crystallized in the warmth of the room. I began grinding it once more, preparing it for the next steps. This time it had to be much purer than the vinegar-based sulfate. The reaction would be better… and also more dangerous. The powder reacted faster when exposed to air, so I sealed it in airtight jars as soon as I was done.\nWhile I waited, I lit the torches in the lab. It was clear I'd be working all night if I had to.\nOnce the black mass had completely cooled, I started grinding it. It was tough—dense.\nBut I didn't stop until I had a fine powder. I couldn't allow large fragments. Everything had to be uniform. When I was done, I poured the powder into the boiling water and let it steep.\nAt that moment, I felt an itch on my arm. I jumped immediately toward the slaked lime bucket in case it was a burn… but no, it was just an itch. I sighed in relief.\nWhen the boiling stopped, I saw that the liquid in the pot had turned a dark yellowish hue. I placed a linen filter and began filtering it. I passed the liquid from one container to another several times, changing the filter with each pass. In the end, the resulting liquid was a bright, pale yellow. Potassium ferrocyanide.\nI began preparing wooden bowls and spoons. This was the final part of the day… or rather, of the night. There was no sunlight left.\nI opened one of the jars of ferrous sulfate, took a spoonful, and dissolved it in a glass bowl with a bit of water. The liquid turned greenish. In another bowl, I poured the ferrocyanide and began adding it slowly to the first one, stirring with the spoon while watching closely.\nAnd then it appeared.\nA deep dark blue precipitate, nearly black at the edges. Prussian blue.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nI let it settle while repeating the same process with all the ferrous sulfate and ferrocyanide I had prepared. Soon, I had several bowls filled with the same precipitate.\nAfter letting it rest, I filtered the contents through linen, and in each filter was trapped a dense blue mass. I took the solid and washed it several times with clean water, then left it to dry to the side of the lab, on clay trays.\nPrussian blue…\nRelief washed over me at the final result. All the exhaustion hit me at once. I was starving. I had been so focused for so many hours that, when I finally relaxed, I nearly collapsed to the floor.\nThere was still work to be done. No time to rest just yet.\nI had no way to weigh the product precisely, but by eye, it looked like about 250 grams. Paint. Dye. Even high-quality ink—if I could manage to make pure alcohol with the still… though that could explode. And if there's something dangerous, it's pure alcohol.\nI stored all the dangerous materials in their jars. Finished grinding what remained, sealed everything tightly, and began meticulously cleaning the lab. I had created a work of art in there. But now... the hardest part came: selling it.\nBut I couldn't sell it under its real name—it sounded strange for the Empire. So it was better to rebrand it as Reikland Blue… my Reikland Blue.\nI removed the heavy leather clothes I had worn throughout the entire process and left them soaking in water, to neutralize any lingering chemical residue. Outside the lab, I washed myself thoroughly with soap, making sure to leave no trace on my skin.\nTriumphant, I went down to the castle cellars. Took an entire leg of salted ham and devoured it without mercy, alongside several apples.\nWith my stomach full and my mind dulled, I climbed up to my room and collapsed onto the bed. Slept like the dead.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

He was enormous. His gaze was that of a predator who had hunted too many times—someone who, if he wanted, could kill me with his bare hands. But at least he was predictable. Brutal, violent, but not subtle.\nHis son is worse.\nHe's got the same eyes. That damned cold, hunter's stare. Except he's just a boy of eleven summers. I don't know what makes him different from the rest of the children, but the seriousness on his face... the way he looks at you, as if measuring your worth—dead or alive. He's already larger than boys of fourteen or fifteen, and his aggression feels far more dangerous than his father's.\nBut what unsettles me most is that he knows how to talk. He knows how to lead a conversation. And more importantly, he knows when to stay silent. That tension, those eyes fixed on you... especially on my nephew, who can't shut his damned mouth.\nI had no choice but to serve this noble, no matter how much I detest them.\nWith his father, I managed to land a contract transporting iron to the forges of Nuln. Back then, I only had one cart and two horses… not the most efficient setup for hauling ore. But after a few trips and a few crowns earned, I went back to Marienburg and convinced my brother to sell off some of our fishing boats. With the money, we bought more wagons and expanded the operation. As terrible as the old baron was, I was confident I could keep that contract for years.\nBut the day I returned to Reinsfeld to renegotiate, disaster struck. Damn orcs. Luckily, I was traveling with a large trade caravan heading to Helmgart and Bretonnia. I was only stopping at the barony along the way. When I saw the banner of the baron riding to our aid, it was a relief. But it didn't last.\nThe giant baron wasn't there. He was dead.\nAnd with him, my contract—verbal and worthless.\nI thought everything was lost. But to my surprise, the kid—because that's what he is, a kid—turned out to be far more politically shrewd than his late father. He knew full well the imperial courts would side with a noble over a Marienburg merchant any day. With a large chunk of my savings sunk into carts and draft animals, I was stuck. He knew it. So did I.\nSo he offered me a new contract: to transport and sell everything produced on his lands. I accepted. What else could I do?\nAnd truth be told… life hasn't been bad. I make more money than I did hauling ore. But I also work harder: finding buyers, walking marketplaces, knocking on doors, walking half a day through cities to sell his damned soap, his tools, whatever comes out of his workshops. His goods aren't for everyone. They're specific. That means good margins, but also more effort.\nI work more. I earn more. But I'm still his servant.\nThen one day, they stopped producing tools . The business collapsed instantly. For some reason, the baron decided all his peasants should \"live like decent people\"—with their own homes and even sewers. He poured a fortune into that project. Rumor has it only Manann knows where the money came from, because it sure wasn't cheap… the imperial architect charged 500 crowns just to inspect the land. That was it. I wasn't going to throw that much gold at something that didn't benefit me. Now, with no tools, only the soaps remain. My earnings dropped again, and I started thinking about grabbing whatever I could and seeking a new deal elsewhere.\nBut today, while I waited to load the last batch of soap before heading to Altdorf, the baron summoned me.\nThat caught me off guard—he's the type who vanishes at will. You don't see him often unless it's for some show of charity, and even then, he's best known for barking at his workers to stay busy.\nWe spent what felt like an eternity locked in some sort of staring contest. The kid had one hand on his chin, staring at me, and it was starting to wear on my nerves.\n\"Rutger…\" he said suddenly.\n\"Yes, my lord…\" I answered, forcing the best smile I could.\n\"You're a competent merchant, aren't you?\" he asked, placing both hands flat on the desk, eyes still fixed on me.\n\"Of course I am. I'm good at my trade,\" I said through clenched teeth. That he would question my skills burned me.\n\"Good…\" he murmured, without any emotion, toying with his blond hair. \"I like my servants to believe they're good at what they do,\" he added, pressing his index fingers together over his lips.\nSilence crept back into the room like a heavy fog. That damned silence.\n\"What have you summoned me for, my lord? I need to prepare the shipment to Altdorf,\" I said, forcing another smile while those cold blue eyes drilled into me.\n\"You're impatient, aren't you? Especially since I haven't given you much work lately...\" the baron mused, glancing down at his desk, then back at me.\n\"I wonder…\" he said, reaching under the table. \"Can you sell this?\"\nHe pulled something from beneath the desk: a wooden bowl filled with dark blue powder. Then, some cloth dyed in a deep, almost hypnotic blue, and several paint balls of the same color.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n\"W‑where did you get that...? Lapis lazuli...? That stuff is… insanely expensive…\" I stammered, unable to take my eyes off it.\n\"Does it matter?\" the baron said, offering a faint smile\n\"Of course it does…!\" I said—too quickly, maybe. I cleared my throat. \"Something that costly, any buyer will want to know who made it—where it's from—to be sure they're not getting low-quality goods. Araby? Cathay?\" I asked, real excitement creeping into my voice. My fingers were already twitching, counting imaginary coins.\nThe baron didn't reply. He just stared. That damned look, now amused. He leaned an elbow on the desk and tilted his head slightly.\n\"I discussed this with the priest of Sigmar…\" he said, face as unreadable as stone. \"I had a dream. In it, the comet crossed the sky and struck the white-stone hills near the old forest. I felt compelled to go there. I dug through the rocks and found a dirty, brittle blue mineral… but when I ground it and processed it the way I felt I should, it became this pigment. The priest said it was a gift from Sigmar—for my loyalty and purity in defending the Empire.\"\nI swallowed hard. I didn't know if I was standing before a lucky man, a madman… or a prophet.\n\"I see…\" I murmured, reaching for the bowl and scooping a bit of the blue powder. I watched it sparkle under the candlelight. \"I don't know if this is high-purity lapis lazuli, but even if it's low-grade… it'll sell. And high. In Altdorf, painters, dyers, and—above all—nobles will kill for something unique. A cloak dyed in this color could become a status symbol… something elite among the courtly circles.\"\nThe baron gave me that calm smile that always makes my skin crawl.\n\"Please, Rutger… use your Marienburg tricks. When you return, I'll have much more. So find me clients.\"\nI gave him a slight bow—more out of habit than respect.\nI quickly gathered everything he offered me. A generous amount, probably a full pound of pigment, several dyed cloaks, and a bunch of paint balls. I transported them with extreme care.\nOnly Manann knows how much this whole batch is worth—but if anything happens to it, I might as well kiss my head goodbye.\nAs usual, my journey to Altdorf began the next morning, this time followed by a larger group of the baron's guards—protecting his investment more than ever, especially since we were also carrying several days' worth of mint-scented soap production.\nIt took two days, but we finally reached the great city of Altdorf.\nI chose to enter through the southern gate instead of the eastern one. If I was going to run into a massive crowd of Sigmarites pouring out of a religious ceremony, at least from the south, the route to the merchant guild was more direct.\nWe had to wait. There was a long line of carts and traders, all queuing while the guards collected their tolls.\n\"Are you carrying pickled turnips?\" one of the guards asked, eyeing the wagons.\n\"No… soaps, for sale,\" I replied, resisting the urge to mention the pigments. A coin earned could easily become a fortune lost if I spoke too freely—but this wasn't my merchandise, so I had to be honest. \"And pigments and dyed cloth,\" I added in a neutral tone.\nThe guard adjusted his belt and tunic.\n\"Dyed cloth pays two pennies per piece. Pigments, a shilling per pound.\" He nodded toward another soldier who had a wooden box where everyone was dropping their coins.\nOne of the baron's guards stepped forward, exchanged a few words with the gatekeeper—too quietly for me to hear—then casually dropped a mix of silver and copper coins into the box. We were waved through.\nInside the city, I made several stops—mainly at clinics and medical offices—to sell the soap at the highest price possible. I took advantage of the fact that the Cult of Shallya had begun openly recommending the baron's soap. According to them, it was the safest option, with consistent quality that didn't vary from batch to batch—unlike most soapmakers who produced inconsistent goods: sometimes solid, sometimes watery, with unpleasant smells or too harsh on the skin.\nIn fact, the Cult of Shallya itself was one of the largest buyers. Not for personal use, of course, but to distribute to the poor, wounded, and sick. The price for them had to be lower, though—there was a formal agreement between Baron von Reinsfeld and the temple: a fixed rate per load destined for the cult.\nI spent nearly an hour moving from buyer to buyer—doctors, merchants, shopkeepers. I had a long list of clients. Some were already waiting for the shipment when I arrived; others just wanted to see what new batches I had brought.\nAnd as always, every time I told the baron we could increase production—that demand was exceeding supply—he gave the same cold, calculated response: that he couldn't buy more pigs per day without jeopardizing the future, and that he flatly refused to import them because prices would spike and net profit would drop.\nIf there's one good thing to say about him, it's that he calculates profit margins better than most merchants in Marienburg.\nNow, with the pigments, cloths, and paints, I was a bit more puzzled. I had never worked with materials this expensive, and I didn't have contacts who'd be willing to spend a generational fortune on dyes. So I wandered around the city, visiting artist workshops and asking if they were interested. Most already had a decent stockpile of lapis-based paints. I asked around at tanneries and dye houses, but while interested, they lacked the clientele to justify a purchase.\nSo I kept looking, searching for a potential buyer who might be interested.\nI entered one of the artists' studios near the Imperial Palace and began speaking with an apprentice who was practicing his brush strokes.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, my good craftsman. Would it be possible to speak with your master? I've come across a lot of lapis lazuli-based paints that may interest him,\" I said with the friendliest tone I could muster.\n\"Oh… the master is busy working and—\" the apprentice began, before a booming voice echoed from the back of the workshop.\n\"Let him in. I still haven't received my order, and it's two weeks late.\"\nThe apprentice stood up quickly. \"This way, please,\" he said, guiding me inside.\nThere, I found several artists immersed in their work. The studio smelled of oil, wood, and aged cloth. In one corner, a gray-haired man was painting a massive portrait of what looked like a stern-faced noble.\nWasting no time, I opened the wooden box carrying several balls of deep blue pigment and showed it to the master. He took it without saying a word. Didn't even ask. He simply chose one of the balls, sliced off a piece, and started working it into his palette.\n\"Impressive…\" he murmured, drawing lines with his brush. \"Whoever made this knew how to evenly capture the pigment in the mix. The problem is they had no idea how to make a usable paint. It's very tough. Requires a lot of work to become usable. Probably mid-grade lapis. I'd like to see some lighter tones… but I might be able to get something decent out of this. Where did you get it?\"\n\"From the barony of Reinsfeld. According to the baron—and the priest of Sigmar—this stone was shown to him in a dream featuring a comet. He followed the vision, extracted it himself, and processed it personally,\" I repeated in a neutral tone, as he had told me.\n\"Really?... Well, if the Cult of Sigmar says so, it must be true,\" the master said with a sarcastic smile. \"And clearly, he doesn't know the first thing about preparing paint. How much for the balls?\"\n\"Eighty crowns for the six,\" I said, throwing out a number blindly, having no idea what the real value was.\n\"A bit low... I assume you have more, don't you? Don't come at me with that old Marienburg merchant trick: sell a little to hike the price of the rest. I know that game,\" he said with a grin as he kept mixing lighter tones on his palette.\n\"Yes, I have more. Let me fetch them.\"\nI left the studio and returned with eleven more boxes of paint balls, along with the glass jar containing the pure pigment.\nI placed everything in front of the master and showed him the full jar. It was exactly one pound of milled pigment.\n\"This will last me months,\" he said, inspecting the contents. \"How much for the jar? I prefer to work it myself. That way, I can soften it from the start.\"\n\"There's a pound in here…\" I said, mentally calculating the weight of each paint ball. \"With this, you could make around forty more, maybe more. I'd say… 530 crowns.\"\n\"Fine. I prefer the pigment. I like how it behaves. Give me a box of balls too, just in case. I like the tone's consistency.\"\nI nodded. Soon after, the master disappeared into the back of the workshop and returned with a chest full of coins. 610 crowns. He counted them in front of me without shame, and I handed him everything.\nNow that I had a rough idea of the pigment's value, everything became easier. Even selling a single ball to individual painters, or passing the product to Marienburg merchants who were also heading back home to resell it to final buyers. Just in paints, I earned close to 900 crowns between artists and merchants.\nThen there was the cloth. I finally managed to sell it to a Marienburg merchant for another 800 crowns. I handed him the entire shipment.\nIn total, over 2,300 crowns just from selling the pigment the baron had found in his hills… and I walked away with just over a hundred in commission.\nFar more than I'd make in a month selling soaps.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Produce the components individually in large quantities and assemble them based on demand. Because if I flood the market with too much blue… I'll saturate it. And if I saturate it, profit drops.\nI have to keep it under control.\nI could probably convince a dwarf to help improve the lab. Scale it up. Automate some of the work with simple mechanisms… and stop relying solely on my own hands.\nBut the secret… the secret dies with me.\nI won't teach this to anyone. I won't take on apprentices. I won't share formulas. No thanks. Then they run off… and become competition.\nAs long as I keep it secret, I'll never have rivals.\nEspecially because most alchemists barely know how to work with vinegar and salt crystals…\nand wouldn't touch strong acids with a ten-foot pole.\nSo… with just my personal knowledge… I'm at least a hundred years ahead of all of them.\nI began to stretch.\n\"I'll have to synthesize about four kilograms of pigment, a liter of acid, and…,\" I murmured, talking to myself as usual.\nThat's when I heard the bell. I'd rigged it in my study—an improvised system for distant alerts. That way, the guards and servants wouldn't have to hear me rambling like a madman.\nI pulled the rope to ring the bell on the other side. It didn't take long for a guard to appear, peeking through the door with a serious expression.\n\"My lord… a knight and men-at-arms, bearing the banners of Margrave von Mackesen, arrived recently and request an audience,\" he said, lowering his head.\n'So finally…' I thought, my eyes drifting toward the arquebus. 'I figured this would take longer… but it seems I'll have to sever ties with the Margrave sooner than expected. Still, I must be careful of the consequences. Terrible consequences.'\n\"Let the knight in. If he wishes to speak with me, I'll gladly receive him within my walls. I want a strong guard presence during this meeting. I don't want our guest to feel we're treating him with disdain,\" I said with a smile.\nAs soon as the guard left, I began loading my arquebus. You never know when a conversation might escalate into something you can't control.\nOnce loaded, I placed the weapon beside my chair. Only the barrel's tip was visible, adorned with dwarven engravings.\nThe guards didn't take long. They entered silently, taking position in the corners of the room, standing firm and motionless. Only then did I allow myself to wait.\nThen I heard it. The echo of steel scraping down the hall. A heavy suit of armor moving forward with purpose.\nAt last, I saw him.\nA knight of the Margrave.\nWe locked eyes. He removed his helmet. I pointed to the chair across from me.\nHe sat in silence. And for several minutes, we exchanged nothing but long stares.\nFinally… the knight spoke.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, young Albrecht,\" said the knight.\n\"Did your lord not teach you how to properly address a noble with titles… knight?\" I said, locking my gaze on him.\n\"My mistake… Baron von Reinsfeld,\" he replied, clearly annoyed.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, then, knight,\" I greeted at last.\nAgain, silence. I watched his jaw tense; he was grinding his teeth.\n\"The Margrave has tasked me with escorting you back to Helmgart. Your education must continue. The regency of your fief shall be entrusted to me until you are deemed of age by the Margrave. I therefore ask that you accompany the men waiting below and return with me to Helmgart,\" the knight said.\n\"No,\" I replied curtly.\n\"Excuse me?... This is an order from your guardian and protector, Margrave Reinhart von Mackesen. You cannot refuse,\" he snapped back.\n\"My answer remains no. From what I understand, for someone to be my protector, they must have me under their control… which is clearly not the case. So if that's all, I kindly ask that you leave my lands. I have no interest whatsoever in a regent,\" I said, offering a slight, sarcastic smile.\n\"Enough!\" the knight shouted, standing and reaching for his sword. My guards did the same.\n\"By order of the Margrave, I will take you back to Helmgart, and if any of you\"—he said, glaring at my men—\"dare to interfere, your families will be executed when I rule in the Margrave's name.\"\nMy guards didn't hesitate. None moved or flinched. They held their ground, menacingly staring back at the knight.\n\"Your intimidation doesn't seem to be working,\" I said with a small smirk.\nThe knight drew his sword.\n\"Fine, I can deal with these peasants,\" he growled furiously.\nI turned my head slightly, as if trying to look behind him. \"So this is your rabid dog… Margrave von Mackesen,\" I said.\nThe knight's eyes widened and he instinctively turned to look behind him… there was nothing.\nI took the moment. Grabbed my arquebus.\nWhen he turned back to me, the barrel was already aimed directly at his chest.\nHe exhaled sharply at the sight of the weapon.\n\"You know? With this dwarven-made gun, I killed a Bretonnian Grail Knight. Two shots: one in the chest, one in the head… how many do you think you can take?\" I said with a laugh, watching his reaction.\nHis eyes started darting around, searching for a way out.\n\"No, no, no… drop the sword on the floor, please,\" I said, still aiming at him. My guards surrounded him.\nThe knight clenched his jaw and threw the sword down. \"I demand to be treated as a prisoner, according to my rank,\" he said angrily.\nMy guards quickly grabbed his arms. One of them fetched a rope. In seconds, he was tied up.\n\"And what rank would that be? From where I stand, it looks like a bandit has gotten hold of the Margrave's banners and is pretending to be one of his men. A bandit… trying to abduct a noble,\" I said, looking at him with contempt.\n\"You know very well who I serve! You've seen me at the banquets,\" the knight said.\n\"I don't recall… All I see is a bandit. And I'll make sure the Margrave is informed of what happened here: that a stranger tried to imprison me, and even kill me. That an investigation should be conducted. That the fate of the real knights and men-at-arms whose uniforms were stolen be discovered. And of course, I'll inform the Elector Count of Reikland… since the Margrave would never attempt to seize lands directly under the Count's authority, would he?\" I said calmly.\n\"You damn honorless bastard! The Margrave won't stay silent after this humiliation,\" the knight roared.\n\"No, he won't. But what happened here is so disgraceful… that if you truly are who you claim to be, the Margrave will try to cover up the scandal,\" I said with a shrug.\n\"Well then… until your identity is confirmed… throw him into the darkest, dampest cell you can find!\" I ordered, turning to my guards.\n\"This won't end like this! This won't end like this! You'll pay for this!\" the knight screamed as he was dragged off to the dungeons, kicking like a pig before the slaughter.\n\"You. Go outside and alert the city watch that there are bandits at the gates, posing as the Margrave's men. Have everyone gather in the village and surround them. I want no deaths… force them to surrender. And when they do… straight to the dungeons,\" I ordered, not even looking at the guard, who ran off without a word.\nI took a deep breath and made my way to the laboratory. From the tower, I had a clear view of everything.\nThere were about twenty men-at-arms, flying the Margrave's banners. They sat calmly on horseback—some chatting, others simply waiting for their knight to return so they could head back to Helmgart. None seemed nervous.\nThe castle gate opened and the guard stepped out, walking casually. He didn't raise any suspicion. No one moved a finger. They kept waiting.\nMinutes passed…\nA large group of my guards began climbing up from the village, blocking the only descent that connected to the road. There were far more of them than the Margrave's men could ever face.\nMy men approached slowly, closing the circle without violence. The horsemen didn't react. I think they believed it was a drill, an exercise. The confusion worked in our favor.\nBy the time they realized what was happening, it was too late.\nI saw them lose control of their horses. Some dismounted willingly. Others were forced off onto the hard ground.\n\"Good… that went well. I've bought myself some time…\" I murmured, exhaling while looking over my desk.\n\"Until the Margrave learns what happened, I need to inform the Elector Count about the conflict… frame it as an attempt to annex lands directly governed by the Emperor through a regency. I suppose the Emperor will give the Margrave a stern warning… Good, I'll secure my position by gathering support from the local Cult of Sigmar… and from Shallya's temple, to certify me as physically and mentally sound.\"\nI turned, grabbed paper, ink, and quill, and began writing.\n\"Emperor… titles… titles… titles…\" I muttered as I wrote.\nIt is with great misfortune that I must inform Your Majesty of a possible attempt to annex my lands by Margrave Reinhart von Mackensen.My alarm arises from the fact that members of his personal guard attempted to take me prisoner within my own halls, apparently with the aim of imposing a regency over the lands entrusted to me for their protection and development.Such actions, if misinterpreted, could jeopardize the stability of overland trade to Marienburg, as well as stir tensions among regions under Your direct sovereign authority.Therefore, this humble servant respectfully requests Your intervention and guidance to prevent unnecessary Imperial bloodshed.Sincerely,Baron Albrecht von Reinsfeld\nI sealed it with my house ring and immediately called for a man-at-arms.\n\"Take it straight to Altdorf. Fresh horse,\" I said without looking up. The man nodded and left at full gallop.\nAnd as for the Margrave… I had to buy myself more time. My letter to the Emperor would take days, maybe weeks. I needed to delay von Mackensen's wrath. So I prepared another letter.\nDear Margrave von Mackensen,It is with misfortune that I bring troubling news.I fear that a group of your men was ambushed by bandits en route to Reinsfeld. Upon arrival, and in my presence, they attempted to take me hostage to impose a regency—something entirely nonsensical, considering both the Cult of Sigmar and the local Cult of Shallya have formally certified that I am in full possession of my physical and mental faculties.These individuals are currently held in my dungeons, awaiting an escort to reclaim them. I trust that a thorough investigation will reveal they were criminals impersonating your men, and that those responsible will be punished according to Imperial law.Sincerely,Baron Albrecht von Reinsfeld\nI folded the letter carefully and placed it on the desk.\n\"No… not yet… I'll wait a few days before sending it…\" I murmured as I sealed the wax. \"The more time I buy, the better.\"\n\"Well… I suppose it's time to put my pigment sales income to use… with two thousand crowns a week, that's eight thousand a month. After paying the architect, I can afford to recruit a considerable force of soldiers. Maybe I can't compete with the Margrave—he's got several regiments paid by the Empire under his command—but as long as I can outmatch his personal guard, everything should be fine. And with a bit of luck, we'll still be… good neighbors,\" I said with a smile. \"Nothing that can't be solved with a marriage to some distant cousin or aunt… so long as she doesn't get in my way.\"\n-------------------------Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The tunnels are already being dug to the dimensions I deemed necessary. All that remains is for you to provide me with the bricks... and your magnificent mortar, of course. Once we have that, we'll work at full capacity. And... I would appreciate a bit more presence from your guards. People aren't happy with us digging so close to their... tents. The noise, the dust... complaints are beginning,\" he said, never taking his eyes off the blueprints in his hands.\n\"Oh, of course. I'll make sure more guards are present during the works. But before I leave you in peace... I'd like to ask you something, architect,\" I said, leaning on a stake driven into the ground. \"Could you build a blast furnace like those in the forges of Nuln?\"\nOtto remained silent for a few seconds. I could see him thinking.\n\"Yes. My studies include Nuln's metallurgy. But I must warn you, I'll still need some schematics that I could obtain through certain colleagues. Everything will be expensive, Baron. Even if you can supply all the construction materials... there are pieces that must be brought directly from Nuln.\"\n\"As long as it reaches fifteen hundred degrees Celsius, that's perfect for me,\" I replied, staring at him.\n\"What in blazes are... Celsius?\" asked Otto, raising an eyebrow, confused.\n\"As long as it can melt steel in large quantities... that's all I care about,\" I said more seriously, tired of explaining things no one understands.\n\"It's feasible. But we'll have to use some dwarven tricks. I'll need refractory bricks, limestone, good clay, cast iron for gates, loading systems, slag pit, ladle buckets, reinforced beams, air vents... but I digress. If I start on that, I'll need to assign a fifth of my crew to the project for at least three months. And if I remember correctly... you were quite worried about your dear peasants not freezing to death this winter,\" Otto said dryly, though not disrespectfully.\n\"Certainly. But that's already taken care of. When construction of the furnace begins, I'll hire additional labor to speed things up. I'll also probably bring in a less prestigious architect to handle the housing,\" I said, watching Otto from the corner of my eye.\n\"I could handle that job as well,\" he replied, not bothering to hide his irritation.\n\"Yes, but you don't have the team to do everything at once, my dear Otto. If you take on the furnace, you'll delay the sewers. I need work to begin now. We can't afford to waste more time,\" I said with a joyless smile.\n\"I can hire more personnel... but it'll take time to make sure they do the job properly,\" the architect said, crossing his arms.\n\"Feel free to hire people from my lands for that work. I believe they'll work even better knowing they're building their own homes,\" I replied, steering the conversation with a satisfied tone.\n\"If I do that, labor costs will rise... and you'll have to cover those costs, Baron. Do you have the gold for it?\" Otto asked, with a hint of doubt in his tone.\n\"I can advance you an extra month's pay, if you like, so you can start hiring immediately. Just tell me how much the furnace will cost and how much per house. I'd like standard homes, for families of five or six,\" I said, pleased.\n\"The furnace... would be about five thousand crowns. Assuming you can supply most of the materials. Three thousand would go just to ship the parts from Nuln. The rest is my fee,\" Otto responded in a measured voice.\n\"Perfect. I'll give you the payment next week and we'll begin. Sound good?\" I said with a broad smile, while Otto looked somewhat doubtful.\n\"Yes, that's fine... Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to hire locals to help with the more basic work. Once the land is ready and we can start building, we'll discuss my fees for the houses. Until then... let me return to my duties,\" said Otto, refocusing on his blueprints, not waiting for further questions.\nSatisfied with how everything had turned out—especially because in the future, once the architect left the area, there would likely be local labor with basic construction knowledge. People I could use once I no longer needed the expensive—but necessary—services of an imperial architect, and only required expansion or buildings that didn't demand so much specialization.\nSo once again, I went to see my workers. Over the last few days, I hadn't been able to ensure they were doing their jobs properly. All my attention had been focused on synthesizing Reikland blue pigment... the jewel of my enterprises, above all others.\nI spend a total of thirty-four crowns a day to maintain my labor force of five hundred seventy people. But now I had to think about other projects. Because once the blast furnace was ready... I'd need to employ many more people in the mining village. Those who currently extract iron for my family won't be able to meet the demand the new furnace will create.\nWhen I arrived at the work site, I saw an army of brickmakers working next to the local clay deposit. They were extracting large amounts using the tools once used to mine iron, now repurposed for digging clay and shaping it into bricks. At the same time, they loaded vast quantities into the multiple kilns, where the fire hardened the material.\nOnce the process finished, they removed the baked bricks and loaded them into carts. All to supply the architect and his constructions. Nearby, a few smiths I assigned to limestone mortar production were watching as the stones were incinerated in the kilns, slowly turning into the white powder I needed so much.\n\"Thanks to Manann, I finally found you,\" said a voice behind me.\n\"Well now... if it isn't my favorite servant,\" I replied, turning around, already recognizing Rutger's voice.\n\"My lord...\" said the merchant, clearly exhausted from walking.\nI remained silent, staring at him.\n\"My lord, I've completed the sale of the lapis lazuli pigments, as you ordered. And I'm pleased to say I bring good news. I've made contact with a dyer who works exclusively for Altdorf nobles… he wants to purchase a large quantity of your pigment for dyes. Also, several of my fellow citizens in Marienburg are already waiting for the next shipment. I'd be needing around ten pounds of your pigment.\"\n\"What did I tell you?\" I asked, arms crossed, without moving.\nRutger sighed heavily.\n\"…About five kilograms?\" the merchant replied, clearly annoyed at having to adapt to my measurements.\n\"That's quite a bit…\" I said, lowering my gaze for a moment to calculate. \"I can produce about a kilo and a half per week.\"\nRutger looked at me in surprise. \"So little? If you truly have the rock you claim to have found… you could easily assign a couple of workers to increase production. I have many clients already desperate to get their hands on your pigment,\" he said, choosing his words carefully, but clearly doubting my decision.\n\"Yes… but I prefer to process it myself,\" I said firmly, hiding the lie behind the most serious face I could muster. \"It's a gift from Sigmar… for me and no one else. Until the god says otherwise, I alone will work the pigment.\"\nThe merchant exhaled in resignation and shook his head. \"I'll see what I can do then…\" he muttered.\nI remained silent for a moment, until Rutger came back at me with another angle.\n\"And what about increasing soap production? I also have far too many orders, Baron. From several towns along the road, especially from the temples of Shallya. Every temple I find on the way to Altdorf places an order. For next week, for the next day I pass by. We could make a fortune if we scaled up production.\"\n\"And where would we get the pigs or the cows?\" I replied, without changing my tone. \"I have to buy animals at high prices from other towns just to get the triglycerides I need. I don't have enough. Not even to slaughter more than three a day.\"\n\"Stirland,\" Rutger said quickly. \"I met a representative of a local noble who sells pigs. Four crowns per head, ready for slaughter. If you wish, I can purchase a large number and bring them here, so they can be slaughtered as needed.\"\nI stared at him.\n\"Incredible work… when we gather the gold—\" I began to say, but he cut me off abruptly.\n\"But I already got it. In addition to bringing another two thousand five hundred crowns from the sale of the pigment you gave me, I managed to sell —in advance— the ten poun..... five kilograms, of pigment to merchants and dyers for the next shipment. I have nine thousand crowns stored, ready to be used in my wagons,\" said Rutger, with a mix of pride and urgency.\n\"That's very good news… but damn it, Rutger… don't sell anything without first knowing if I can deliver,\" I said, surprised and annoyed at once.\nNow I'd have to spend the entire week in the lab, hunched over burners and boiling vessels, trying to synthesize the damn five kilograms of pigment he promised without asking.\n\"Fine… I'll do my best. And I'll fulfill your request. But don't do it again. Understood?\" I said, staring at him.\nRutger nodded silently, swallowing hard.\n\"Excellent… Ah, Rutger. Before you leave, buy a thousand pigs from the Stirland noble. If possible, ninety percent females, ten percent males. I don't care if you have to pay a few extra coins. And I need you to go to Nuln and bring me a few things from the city.\"\nThe merchant smiled again. Every time he heard \"Nuln,\" his expression changed.\n\"What do you need, my lord?\" he asked cheerfully, as if he'd just earned another commission.\n\"Pikes. A lot of pikes. Here in Reikland they're rare, but in Wissenland and its surroundings they're more common. Bring me three thousand, if you can. I'm increasing my personal forces and I need proper weapons for the job. Also, buy as many chainmails and padded jackets as you can with the remaining two thousand crowns. The other three thousand you'll deliver to the imperial architect. I'm about to build a blast furnace… and I honestly needed those funds.\"\nI finished the sentence with a wide smile. Rutger looked satisfied as well.\n\"Yes, and I've already taken my commission. So everything's fine,\" he said in a relaxed tone.\n\"Yes… yes… now just focus on doing what I ordered. You've left me quite a mess with that damn pigment. I'll have to lock myself in the lab all week thanks to your Marienburg tricks,\" I growled as I searched for my horse.\nI mounted immediately. I still had things to check before isolating myself in the lab. I made sure the production of planks and nails continued without interruptions. I ordered the brickmakers to begin using at least one of the kilns to start making roof tiles. The houses coming in winter couldn't have wooden roofs forever.\nOnce everything was running, I returned to the castle. I ate something quickly — hard bread and a bit of cold cheese.\nThen I locked myself in my quarters.\nI put on the heavy work garments, hardened leather and thick cloth. Tightened the gloves, and tied the charcoal-activated cloth over my face.\nThe part I hated the most was about to begin.\nI'd be producing the pigment again — this time in bulk. Exhausting work. Suffocating heat. Risk of chemical burns.\nThanks to Rutger... another week in isolation.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It was fatigue speaking — my hands still trembling from the strain, eyes reddened from smoke, back aching from being hunched over for so many hours. I had optimized the procedure to reduce downtime, to improve yield… and yet, every minute spent in the lab was a minute less spent governing.\nTraining a couple of young apprentices no longer seemed like such a stupid idea.\nIt was tempting.\nDelegate the basics, keep control of the key ingredients, and oversee the process without chaining myself to the fire and glass… but the risk. Always the damned risk. The moment another person knew the process, my monopoly could end. And that, I was not willing to allow. Not yet. Not while the market paid what it paid and the fools in Marienburg fought over a few grams like it were gemstones.\nSo I endured.\nI produced seven kilograms of pigment. Alone. Through sheer effort. Locked away in my room for days, my protective clothes soaked in stale sweat, arms sore from moving jars, stoking fires, and grinding compounds.\nThe next day, finally free from my duties as a forced alchemist, I received news that, for once, didn't irritate me.\nRutger had returned. And to my surprise, he had done his job well.\nHe brought all the pikes I asked for. Some chainmail. He even looked pleased with himself, as if returning from a crusade.\nApparently, he had saved quite a bit on the pigs by negotiating a discount for buying in bulk. That margin allowed him to offset the higher price of the pikes. As he explained, they were not only scarce in Reikland, but many blacksmiths were producing for the provincial militia, which had driven prices up. But he managed to fulfill everything. What remained was barely enough for a couple of basic suits of armor… nothing more. The rest of the order for padded jackets would have to wait for more funding from future pigment sales.\nSo this was a great day.\nA day to eat my own words. For years I never understood why my father spent so much on guards to protect a place that was, in theory, peaceful. I always thought it was the thinking of a militaristic noble. But now, I was about to recruit a thousand new men. One thousand. That was six percent of my total population — if I added the four hundred men already in my service protecting my holdings.\nMadness. But a madness I could easily afford, thanks to my star product. The blue pigment of Reikland was feeding my coffers far beyond what any local tax could. Luxuries that the urban nobility could keep spending on endlessly, detached from the harsher realities of the Empire's frontier.\nAnd while I could recruit up to eight hundred more without ruining myself, going beyond that would start to cause real problems. The local economy would begin to creak. Fewer hands in the fields. Less bread production. Smaller harvests. So I couldn't overreach.\nNo. Better to wait. To continue growing my peasant population and, with that, gradually expand my personal forces.\nThe steady trickle of migration kept flowing from the north of the Empire. Especially from Ostland, Ostermark, Norland, and Middenland. People fleeing hunger, petty wars, unjust taxes, or simply local trouble, preferring to try their luck as settlers in more fertile and safer lands.\nThe problem was always the same: they brought no census documents. No one could guarantee they weren't bandits, deserters, or wanted murderers. But I had no way to verify it… so for now, the only thing I could do was keep watch, write down names, and hope that work and bread would make any criminals among them reform — or else, I'd have to be more vigilant about theft and local conflicts.\nAs usual, while soap, pork, black bread\nwere distributed, a call had also gone out to every man between sixteen and forty summers to join the Baron's personal guard.\nWith pay. With clothing. And with privileges — like a weekly mug of beer and housing in the barracks. I'd probably have to build new ones or assign some guards to the empty rooms in the castle.Follow current novᴇls on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nThe mustering yard outside the castle was crowded. Dozens and dozens of men waited in hopes of securing a spot. Some were already working on my projects — which didn't bother me in the slightest — as many had been chosen from the start for their build. It was just a matter of reassigning them to something more… useful.\nSo I began selecting the most capable.\nFirst by size, then by muscle mass.\nIt was no surprise that many of the tallest and strongest came from the harsher provinces of the north. Especially Norland. On average, they stood a head taller than those from Reikland. Broad shoulders, calloused hands, hardened eyes. People who had fought the elements and lived another day. Many of them probably couldn't read or write, but I didn't care. I didn't need scribes. I needed men who could endure the cold, the mud, and the march.\nThen I began checking mouths.\nI had them kneel slightly and open their mouths so I could see clearly. More than one swallowed hard before showing their teeth. I was surprised to see how many had firm sets. It made sense: food in those lands is as tough as the weather. Chewing dry bread, fibrous roots, and smoked meat toughens the molars. Even so, a few had missing teeth. Some with visible gaps.\nAnd that… was a problem.\nEspecially if I planned to train them as arquebusiers.\nI had intended to introduce pre-measured black powder charges, just enough for one shot. To open those packets quickly, without tools… teeth were used. One mistake, and a man lost precious seconds, or dropped all the powder. So those with incomplete sets would be disqualified from that role. Perhaps they could serve as pikemen or halberdiers… but not as gunners.\nThen came the final test.\nFlat feet.\nI asked them to wet the soles of their feet in buckets and walk across a stretched-out cloth. I examined each footprint. I was looking for the arch, the curve. Those without it… out.\nFlat feet are a sentence. On the march, they give out first. They tire faster. Their ankles buckle sooner. And when they hurt, they don't just hurt a little — they hurt to the point of becoming useless. If I couldn't trust a man to march thirty kilometers with full gear on his back, he was no good to me. Not even if he stood two meters tall.\nSo, one by one, I began marking those who didn't make the cut.\nThough, to be honest, I only found one man with flat feet. Just one. Among hundreds. So, in the end, the test turned out to be a waste of time. I spent nearly an hour examining the feet of peasants\nAnd each of these men would have to learn how to use them if they didn't want to have them ripped from their hands in their first real fight.\nI had already raided my family's armory like a starving dog. It was the place where weapons and armor were stored in case we had to arm the men called to join state regiments if the Emperor ever required it. But considering the Emperor was unlikely to launch a massive campaign anytime soon, those armors reserved for emergencies were better put to use now — especially with the threat posed by the Margrave.\nI rummaged through shelves, boxes, and old chests forgotten by past generations. What I found didn't surprise me: padded jackets, old, with the smell of damp leather and dust, but still usable. A good cleaning, patching a few seams… and they were ready to return to the field. Unfortunately, some armors that might have served were too rusted or broken to use.\nAnd although some of my guards weren't too keen on recruiting so many foreigners, the numbers were clear: seventy percent of the recruits were migrants. Outsiders from the north. From Ostland, Middenland, Norland. Tall men, hardened, with no roots in these lands… but with something far more useful: hunger.\nIf necessity turned me into a killing machine, it could forge them the same way.\nSo, after dismissing those who didn't meet my standards, I took the rest marching toward the Grey Mountains, to a clearing I had scoped out some time ago. Initially, I had considered it for farmland, but the presence of too many trees, deep roots, and scattered rocks made me change my mind. Better to expand the fields elsewhere. This ground would serve a different purpose now.\nAs we advanced, I watched the mess unfold.\nThe recruits didn't know how to carry a five-meter pike. Some tried balancing it like a log. Others tripped, bumped into one another, or spun the shaft, accidentally hitting those beside them. More than one cursed when a tip scraped their back or head.\nBut they kept marching.\nDisorganized. Noisy. Without rhythm or coordination. Little more than a mob of peasants armed with long sticks… but at least they did it under my command.\nWhen we reached the clearing, some of my guards were already waiting. They stood by the supply wagons: tools, axes, ropes, wheelbarrows, picks, and shovels. Nothing the recruits were expecting. I could see it on their faces.\nI made them form up. One hundred lines of ten men. Nothing fancy. Just enough so they could see one another and understand where each of them stood.\nOnce they were all in position, I pointed to one of the wagons full of tools.\n\"Well, good men of the Empire…,\" I said loudly and clearly, without kindness, \"…today your training as soldiers begins. And it begins the old way.\"\nMany stood still, tense.\n\"Today you will not wield weapons. Today you will not learn how to charge with a pike. Today you will build the place where you'll sleep, bleed, and become the warriors the Empire needs to defend itself. This will be your new regimental camp. Here you will train. Here you will live. Here you will earn your bread. And here you will sleep until you become a force capable of enduring the harshness of the world.\" I finished and pointed to the wagon of tools.\nAt last, they began setting down their pikes and picked up shovels, axes, and picks. They started digging trenches, cutting down trees, and removing rocks from the terrain, trying to clear it completely so they could begin setting up tents.\nI joined in with a shovel, especially in the trenches, since all the time I had spent digging made me quite good at it. Besides, it brought me closer to the troops — and I knew all too well what happened when an officer became too unpopular with his men. In the chaos of battle, it's hard to tell whether a bullet comes from the enemy… or from an ally tired of following the orders of the officer in charge. So, keeping that closeness was always important.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The first sewer tunnels had been dug, and the first houses were starting to rise. Much of what had been mined in the quarry shifted to stone that had to be chiseled before being transported back, but that would now serve as a foundation along with extra bricks and timber supplied by the loggers. Naturally, Otto didn't forget to send me the bill for the houses: about fifty crowns each, since all the materials were provided by my own workers.\nAs for my armed forces, we had already begun the most basic training now that the camp was fully established. Dozens of trees had been cut down, every long and stubborn root pulled from the earth, and each stone that might hinder carts, soldiers, or tents had been removed, leaving a perfectly flat field where threats could be seen from kilometers away.\nWe quickly used the timber, ropes, hammers, nails, and planks to erect palisades and build watchtowers, manned by my most veteran guards to keep the recruits from being distracted by common camp duties and allow us to focus entirely on training. Because, as it stood, they were nothing more than numbers—numbers that would break in a real battle,especially with the letter sent to the margrave\nWe started with long-distance runs through nearby hills, the goal being to maintain a steady pace for extended stretches, building endurance. The poor physical condition of most men was obvious. While they had the strength for hard labor over long hours, sustained cardio was something else entirely. Only I could keep pace the first few days, jogging ahead while the others fell behind, and I stayed back to encourage the exhausted.\nAfter that came the real burn: leg-focused training. Squats with lunges—key to building thigh endurance, essential for holding a pike with knees bent most of the time. Then abdominal work, followed by push-ups, ending with a simple lift: a metal bar connected to buckets filled with water, hoisted to the groin.\nThis daily routine nearly broke them. The day after that first full session, I found every one of them sore to the point of immobility. But I still made them run, relying more on provocation than orders—mocking them with my age, pointing out that a boy could do it and they couldn't. It stung their pride, especially because I wore a chainmail shirt twenty kilos heavier. Most started running just to prove me wrong; the rest followed to avoid punishment.\nEach day, I alternated physical training with drills.\nThough pikemen rely far more on discipline and coordination to keep their formation tight under any charge, they also needed hand-to-hand training in case the formation collapsed under a brutal assault or constant pressure. So I paired them up and made them spar with heavy wooden swords. The goal was simple: get them used to holding weight in their arms—for the pike, and in the worst case, for swinging a blade like something more than a child with a stick.\nTo finish each day, we held formation drills.Follow current novᴇls on NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nThis wasn't about strength but about obeying instantly. We implemented a series of clear audio signals that had to be recognized without hesitation. There was no room for doubt or thinking. If the signal meant turn, they turned. If it meant march, they marched. If it meant lower pikes, they lowered them. And if it meant form a defensive line… they damn well better know how to do it.\nWe practiced marching with pikes raised. Shifting instantly to combat stance. Turning in unison ninety degrees. Reorganizing into squads.\nAnd the hardest maneuver: forming a circle, back to back, pikes leveled outward in all directions. That maneuver exposed every flaw.\nMany couldn't move in sync. Some stepped back instead of forward. Others turned the wrong way. More than a few got disoriented, lost their footing, or got trapped between comrades. Some even dropped their pikes from strain. I made note of every one.\nAfter two weeks of hard training, I gave them a day off. They'd shown noticeable improvement, learning to work together. They weren't soldiers yet, but they were beginning to move like a unit.\nI used that free day to check on a problem that was becoming increasingly apparent, especially now that the harvest heavy work was approaching.\nThe lack of hands in the fields.\nWith most of the able-bodied men either in my army or working for me directly, the total absentee rate had already reached around forty percent of the male labor force. That left the fields in the hands of children and their mothers, doing what they could with tools of questionable quality—many of them worn or makeshift.\nAs I rode past the half-empty fields the families were trying to maintain, it became painfully clear: the harvest would be poor even before the seeds were planted.\nAnd the worst part? There wasn't much I could do about it.\nImmigrants arriving each week were welcomed with promises of land ownership, which meant that, once settled, they preferred to work their own plots rather than lend a hand in someone else's.\nExpropriating the land and making myself sole owner of every parcel could be a solution—centralize production under my command, impose order, and pay a fixed wage to every peasant while applying some modern techniques and tools I could provide.\nIt might work.\nBut it would be extremely expensive. And the most dangerous part: the risk of revolt would skyrocket. No one likes having their land taken away. No one.\nPeople can forgive the murder of a father… sooner than the theft of their property.\n\"In a way, their land is also part of my income… and if they starve, I'll have to spend my own money feeding them. Taxes would drop, I'd lose the mill's revenue, and even if crop income is a minor percentage—not even double digits of my total earnings—it still affects food stability.\"\nSo I decided to reach into my pocket before hunger hit, instead of digging much deeper later, when merchants would try to sell everything to me at outrageous prices.\nI have more horses than any other noble in the region. Perhaps only the Emperor surpasses me, as I'm the only Reikland noble raising horses on a large scale—aside from the royal stables in Altdorf. But not all horses are fit for sale: some are too skittish, or simply refuse to be ridden. Many end up sold as mere draft animals.\nStill, I had enough to loan to the peasants, so they could replace some of the lost labor by using horses with plows… though I'd also need the plows.\nAnd probably provide a few tools. As my merchant from Marienburg wisely said, hoes always sell well, because peasants can save up for weeks or months just to get a better one that makes the brutal work in the fields a bit more bearable.\nWith the plan in mind, I decided to visit the Temple of Shallya. This kind of altruism, at the very least, deserved some political recognition.\nRiding through the half-empty fields, I soon reached the temple. Upon entering, I saw the usual scene: priests cleaning and bandaging wounds, tending to those too injured to move, performing their duties with their trademark compassion.\nUpon seeing me, many approached to thank me for everything I was doing for the people.\n\"Ugh… why is there a metallic smell in the air? Tin? That could be toxic,\" I said, uncomfortable with the strong metallic scent I was picking up.\n\"I'm not sure what you mean, young lord… the temple has been cleaned and purified,\" one of the priests replied.\n\"Right… must be my imagination…\" I muttered, though the metallic smell still clung to the air.\nThe high priestess of the local cult came to greet me, and we went to speak in her office.\n\"Welcome, good sir. How may a humble servant of the White Lady assist a young man so devoted to the care of his people?\" she said with a broad smile.\n\"I come once more to seek your cult's help. Obviously, by prioritizing my duties to Deus Sigmar, I've taken many of the laborers from the fields… and clearly I worry this could cause a famine. That's why I've come to ask if the Temple of Shallya could serve as my intermediary in temporarily distributing horses, plows, and agricultural tools. I know I should ask the temple of Taal and Rhya, but there's only one priest, and I don't want to overwhelm him,\" I said with a smile, ignoring the heavy metallic scent in the room.\nHer face lit up even more than usual.\n\"Of course, my good lord… we'd be delighted to take on this task. I'm always heartened that you find compassion in your heart and time to think of your people. If only half the nobles were like you… we'd live in a much better world,\" said the priestess, genuinely pleased.\n\"It is my duty to protect the lands that the Emperor—\" I began, but suddenly felt a strong metallic taste in my mouth, as if I had a coin there, yet couldn't find it with my tongue.\n\"What's wrong, my lord? Is something the matter?\" asked the priestess, concerned.\n\"For some reason I'm tasting metal… could I have a wound in my mouth?\" I asked, moving my tongue, searching for that coin-like presence stuck to my palate.\nShe asked me to open my mouth and examined it closely.\n\"I see nothing strange, my lord… no visible wounds, and your teeth are perfect. Did you eat something odd? A root or a mushroom, perhaps?\" she asked, worried.\n\"No… nothing like that… I suppose it must be the food. Maybe some prankster dropped a coin into the soup and I'm just now tasting the aftertaste,\" I said, trying to reassure myself… though the sensation didn't fade.\n\"Let's put the matter aside… I'll have some horses brought and order some plows from the smiths. I also have some tools ready, since I was handing them out to the migrants, but I trust you'll deliver them to those most in need,\" I added with a forced smile, hiding my discomfort.\n\"Of course,\" the priestess said, giving a polite nod.\nThe conversation concluded, I rose and took my leave. Unfortunately, even after leaving the temple, that damned metallic smell still clung to everything. And slowly, I began to realize where the scent was really coming from.\nI returned to my castle, overwhelmed by the sensation… but it probably wasn't the best idea. The overwhelming metallic stench of weapons, armor, locks, buckles, hinges—every piece of ironwork—smothered my senses. It was as if the very air carried a strange metallic resonance.\nWhen I finally reached my chambers, I took off my gloves, intending to rest a bit. But just as I reached for the door, the metal lock began to melt and mold around my hand.\n\"What the hell is happening…?\" I muttered, watching the bronze deform beneath my touch.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I could smell every metal around me, and no matter how much water I drank or how much I ate, I couldn't get rid of the metallic taste in my mouth. Everything tasted like metal. Everything smelled like it.\nAnd the worst part? It only got worse. It wasn't just that I was deforming every metal I touched—now I was also oxidizing it on contact. I turned my chainmail, once a faithful protective layer, into useless junk just by brushing it with my fingers. That's when I started wearing gloves at all times.\nI tried to carry on as if nothing was happening. But it was useless. I began to feel the presence of nearby metal: a mix of scent and some kind of vibration on my skin told me exactly where every piece of metal was around me.\nAt the military camp, I knew where all my men were because I could feel their pikes shifting, their armor clinking... Even with my eyes closed, I could see the metal floating in the air, like it no longer belonged to them.\nWhile jogging, I could feel the recruits drawing closer just from the daggers they had at their belts.\nWhen I went to handle my business, I felt a desperate urge to lick the nails the blacksmiths were forging... and for a few seconds, something inside me whispered that I should stick my hands into the forge. That the iron was calling to me. That I had to purify it. That only I could.\nI resisted, of course. As strong as those urges were. When the day ended, I locked myself in my laboratory, hoping silence and solitude would help... but everything just got worse. All my chemical compounds began calling to me more strongly. I wanted to touch the sulfuric acid, to stick my hands into the furnace. Every fiber of my being begged me to give in. I felt like I was going insane.\nAnd just when I thought it would all consume me... it stopped.\nThe metallic smell vanished. The taste in my mouth was gone. I could no longer feel every piece of iron in the castle.\nI could finally think clearly, and I understood what was happening: the damned Wind of Chamon was wrapping around me... making me sensitive to magic. A potential mage—if trained.\nThe danger I'd been exposed to all day was immense. At any moment, I could've drawn the attention of a daemon... and had it right in front of me, trying to kill me—or worse.\nSlowly, the sensation began to return. I could feel it creeping back in.\nThere was always this constant tingling in my body, probably from the winds swirling around me. I calmed myself down and tried to stay focused, even as all the strange effects started to come back. But this time, they weren't so overwhelming.\nBecause of that, I decided to isolate myself temporarily, so no one would discover what was happening. This was a serious problem. Being a mage in the Empire meant three options: either you become a wizard and leave everything behind to be locked away in Altdorf, only to be let out when needed... or a witch hunter or priest of Sigmar catches you, and you're forced into the first option—or the pyre, if they mistake your magical gift.\nAnd the third option: stay silent, try to suppress it with a charm… or something. But that might also attract a daemon.\n\"Shit,\" I muttered, rising to my feet in frustration. \"Shit… shit… I just started fighting political battles and now this… How the hell am I supposed to show up in court? If I get anywhere near the capital, they'll realize immediately that I have magical potential and force me to take on a regent so I can dedicate myself to study and controlling my magic… which is basically being under the Margrave's custody. But they could still hand over everything I've worked for to my good-for-nothing brother, who's probably at the university waiting for all the gold I've earned to fall into his lap,\" I said, staring out the window as the sensation surged again.\nWhen I finally calmed down and started thinking rationally again, the sensation decreased considerably.\n\"Curious… tied to emotions,\" I murmured as I mentally analyzed the changes in my senses… noticing that when I switched to an investigative mindset, the effects diminished even further.\nI spent the next few days in total isolation, trying to figure out how to control, at the very least, my reactions to the Winds of Magic. And I was making progress. At least in keeping calm and containing my reactions… especially while working with pigments. That was when I felt the most focused.\nAlthough I kept issuing orders through my guards, the lie—that I was sick—didn't hold up for long. People began asking why I wasn't present during food distributions. Apparently, the peasants were starting to associate my face with free food… which, come to think of it, wasn't a bad thing. But now that I wasn't showing up, it was causing concern. An unexpected reaction.\nThe Temple of Shallya was the first to move. They sent priests to try and heal me… or at least keep me stable through my \"illness.\" They repeatedly asked to be let in, offering healing and care.\nSo I had to change the excuse: now I claimed I'd been injured during training and was recovering. Just enough to get the bothersome Shallyan priests to go pester someone else.\nAs the days passed, it was getting easier to control my abilities… or defects, if that's what they were. I could manage my perception of metals better, as long as I wasn't overwhelmed. I was cautious not to be surrounded by too much metal, but I began getting used to interacting with small amounts.\nMy main focus was not oxidizing anything while handling it without gloves, taking my time. Controlling the tingling in my hands just before touching metal became my top priority. Sometimes I oxidized it a little, sometimes completely… but with enough concentration, I could stop my hands from destroying it on contact.\nAfter many failed attempts, I began to improve. I could control the oxidation. I could choose to trigger it… or not.\nOnce I mastered that, I improved in another area as well: I began to suppress my sharpened senses from seeking out metals. I practiced resisting the compulsion my body exerted on its own. Using my limited understanding of how the Winds functioned, I began to fully control the side effects… even suppress them completely.\nAnd just as I was trying not to lose control of the Winds of Chamon, another interruption came: something about my maternal grandfather and mother being in town and requesting an immediate audience with me.\nHonestly, I had no real idea who they even were exactly… but for now, I cared more about mastering my magic than being seen as a heretic.\nMy priority was to disperse the Winds surrounding me, not to become an obvious target for a witch hunter or a Sigmarite priest.\nThe trial-and-error process continued for several more days, until I decided to test whether I could use magic at will. I had already learned to shut the faucet of magic off… now I had to try to open it.\nOxidizing something was one thing. Reversing that oxidation was something entirely different.\n\"And I have several dozen kilograms of rusted metal I'd like to repair,\" I muttered, staring at daggers, swords, and chainmail that had been my test subjects. They had been destroyed by my touch, turned to rust or warped as if melted.\nBut I had no success. Letting the magic pass through me and turn metal to rust was one thing… forcing it to restore that same metal was another.\nFrustration got the better of me. I lost part of the control I had over sealing the Winds, and the effects came rushing back: the scent of metal, the taste of copper, sensitivity to every metallic object around me.\n\"Oxidation is the loss of electrons. Iron turns into ferric oxide by transferring its charge to oxygen. What has been oxidized can be reduced. I just need to return the electrons… by taking them from the oxygen. This should…\" I murmured, placing my hands over the chainmail, focused on what I wanted to achieve. I tried to force the Winds tingling in my hands to obey my will.\n\"It works… it worked,\" I said, standing up, surprised to see part of the chainmail had returned to its original state.\n\"Excellent… excellent… this means I can… yes, yes, I can apply my knowledge of atoms here… let's go again,\" I said as I placed my hands on the rusted mail and forced the Wind through my fingers, trying to draw electrons from the oxygen.\nI could feel energy coursing through my arms, and as I watched, I saw the rust slowly vanish from the metal.\nMaintaining that sensation in my arms, I continued until the entire chainmail was no longer rusted—even shinier than the day I first used it.\n\"Suck on that… I don't need some damn College of Magic to teach me anything,\" I said, jumping in excitement.\nUntil the metal started melting in my hands.\n\"No… no… no… I ruined it…\" I muttered as I watched nearly the entire chainmail become a dark, dense liquid slipping between my fingers.\nI tried to gather it, but it was like holding hot, sticky paste that wouldn't stop dripping away.\n\"Shit… lost control… months of a blacksmith's work gone in seconds,\" I muttered, watching the liquid iron escape my grip with no way to stop it.\n\"Come on… I can do this… iron atoms arrange in a rigid lattice, held by metallic bonds. To liquefy it, I just need to add enough thermal energy to break that structure and allow the atoms to move freely… without losing cohesion… I need to rebuild the rigid structure,\" I whispered as I started to gather the liquid into an amorphous ball, trying to force the magical energy to restructure the metal.\nAnd slowly, I succeeded. …but the iron was no longer liquid. It was now a solid mass, like metallic clay.\nAs I continued manipulating that iron ball, I noticed it vibrated. It tilted slightly, pulsing in the direction of a piece of charcoal I had near the furnace.\nIntrigued, I kept the energy flowing through one arm. With the other hand, I picked up the charcoal, brought it closer to the iron, and allowed the energy to circulate between the two materials.\n\"Malleable as clay, but lacking the necessary hardness… Carbon is the key. Its proportion defines the essence of steel: not too soft, not too brittle… two percent would be ideal,\" I murmured as I slowly merged the materials and began to mold them carefully, feeling something completely new begin to form under my hands.\nI kept molding until the iron smelled different. And felt different.\nThanks to my altered sense of smell, I could distinguish a piece of iron from this new steel I held. The scent was darker, heavier.\nBut just as my excitement began to grow, a brutal wave of exhaustion struck me without warning.Thɪs updatᴇd by\nI was forced to leave everything for the next day. I placed the steel ball to the side, on the stone table, and went straight to bed without even removing my clothes.\nI collapsed.\nTomorrow, perhaps, I could continue… and keep perfecting my control.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

At the very least, I could now choose when to use my abilities and when not to, which was enough… for now. I didn't like leaving everything without personal supervision, and I couldn't keep being absent without raising suspicions.\nSo, once I felt safe, I began showing up again in the mornings. I tried to stay calm, to keep my emotions in check. I just had to avoid catching the eye of any Sigmarite priest or witch hunter who might be lurking around. In the meantime, I needed to find a way to conceal my magical presence.\nSome position. An amulet. Something that would draw attention away from me.\nThe problem was obvious: those objects were not only extremely expensive, but also strictly controlled by the State to prevent \"people like me\" —that is, anyone wanting to hide a magical gift— from getting their hands on one.\nThat left only one realistic option: the black market.\nBut the first obstacle was finding it. I had no contacts in that underworld, not even a clue whom to ask. And the risk was even worse: some fool might offer me a cursed or corrupted object instead of what I was actually looking for.\nThe more viable option was Marienburg. There, imperial regulations don't apply. Nothing does. Anything can enter or leave those ports… even what I need. But if I go, I must do it personally. I can't delegate. I can't let anyone know what I'm looking for.\nBecause looking for something that hides magic… is like screaming that I'm a mage.\nSo, whether I like it or not… I'll have to travel to Marienburg. It's that or lose everything.\nWhile I was isolated from the world, two letters reached me.\nThe first came from the higher imperial courts. It informed me of the exact date when justice would be served: in three months. It also included a list of the judges who would handle the case, with a gentle suggestion of whom I should convince with generous gifts to help them conveniently understand that my claim was valid. Most important: there was a direct order to the Margrave prohibiting him from using State regiments to continue the conflict. In other words, he could no longer disguise his grudge as an official matter. It was now a private conflict between nobles… until the court delivered its verdict.\nThe second letter was from the Margrave himself. Apparently, he had fallen for my lie. He truly believed his men had been ambushed and even sent troops to investigate. But when he received the letter from the court, he realized I'd made him waste his time. He must have been furious. Just reading the letter, I could feel the rage he must've felt realizing I had played him for a fool… and bought time while he exhausted himself chasing ghosts.\nHe gave me one week to return to Helmgart and continue \"my training.\" Obviously, I was going to ignore that order. I wasn't going anywhere. If he wanted to push it, he'd have to come himself. He would probably send scouts, and when he saw I had far more forces than he expected, he'd be forced to bring his personal troops just to have a proper chance of attacking me.\nBut that's where the real danger lies.\nNo matter how many soldiers I have… he has the upper hand in armament.\nAnd that, on the battlefield, can change everything.\nFortunately, the training continued smoothly, simply by following the orders I had sent by letter. Nothing out of the ordinary. Everything proceeded as usual, though the man-at-arms I had left in charge probably didn't push them as hard as I would've—until they were utterly and absolutely broken.\nAs for the rest, I gave all my pigs to some farmers who had arrived from Stirland, just as I had with the families handling the horses. A thousand pigs under their care, and full freedom to request whatever they needed to ramp up soap production on a large scale.\nAnd well… after two weeks buried in constant work —because that's what keeps me calm— I managed to produce large quantities of pigment. The week before my departure, I gave Rutger about ten kilograms, which brought in a huge profit: more than twenty thousand crowns. And according to him, buyers kept multiplying. I still had several more kilos left, so I gave another five to Rutger… and decided to take five with me.\nWith that settled, I made the decision to leave for Marienburg as soon as possible. I needed something to help me camouflage my magical problem, even if it meant ignoring the audience with my family. If they waited two months to show up, they can wait a few more days.\nI took a group of forty guards and twenty men-at-arms. We loaded a carriage with plenty of gold and the remaining pigments, just in case I ran short of money in the city. The journey on horseback would be long and dangerous —bandits, goblins, orcs— so I preferred to play it safe and paid for passage by ship to save time and avoid trouble.\nWe arrived in the afternoon at Schilderheim, the nearest trade city to my domain. We went directly to the docks, ignoring anything else the commerce-rich city had to offer. I left a few guards to tend the horses, and the rest of us boarded the first ship heading to Marienburg.\nThe trip was supposed to take two days, maybe less. Once aboard, I focused on not vomiting. First experience on a ship… and it was not pleasant. In addition to keeping my stomach under control, I had to suppress my emotions to avoid losing control of the Winds surrounding me. Sleeping was going to be difficult. My men were in the same state, only worse. Many lost the fight and emptied their guts directly into the river.\nWe passed several riverside towns soon after: Uder, Merxheim, Schinfeld, and Zandt, just as the sun began to set. The night dragged on. Trying to sleep while the river rocks you every few seconds is no comfort, but I eventually managed to fall asleep… though I woke up several times, convinced I'd fall off the bed at any moment.\nI finally got up when sunlight slipped through the shutters. I sat up, looked out the window… and there it was.\nMarienburg.\nA monstrous city stretched out before me. The river was already turning into sea. And there it stood: endless rooftops, towers, smoke, sails, cranes, warehouses, barges… trade as far as the eye could see. For a moment, I lost focus. The metallic smells around me overwhelmed my senses. It was as if every metal in the world were right there, crashing into my awareness all at once.\nI forced myself to calm down, took a deep breath, and waited patiently until the ship docked at Suiddock.\nSeveral dockworkers boarded our vessel and began questioning me.\n\"What are you bringing with you?\" asked a customs worker.\n\"Imperial legal currency, and blue pigment,\" I said, trying to hide my face as much as I could under my clothes.\n\"Ah… so you're planning to buy. How much pigment?\" the customs worker asked.\n\"Exactly five kilograms,\" I said, showing him the jar I had brought with me.\n\"Bah, that's not much… that'll be two crowns in your case to unload your goods,\" the worker said, extending his hand.\nI reached into my pouch and gave him the coins. In return, he handed me a stamped paper confirming I had paid the necessary duties to sell in Marienburg.\nAs we unloaded our cargo, I couldn't help but notice the stares aimed at me. I had removed any heraldry or symbols from both my men and myself. Ideally, as little as possible should be known about this trip. With the gold and pigments unloaded, we began moving out of the port.\nI noticed several hand signals between locals and guards. Clearly, something was being exchanged in their palms.\n\"...Bribes. Common practice… or are they planning something?\" I murmured, watching men in black hats being slipped little pouches.\nOnce everything was unloaded, the cart secured, and the horses under control, we began to move forward. I tested my conversational and bartering skills as we went, trying to get the attention of anyone we came across. But all I got were warnings not to mess with the kind of people I was asking about—or that such people could kill me… or attract the attention of others far worse.\nThe number of eyes on us grew with every block. So I decided not to push my luck further and headed toward a more discreet area to ask questions and do business without unnecessary witnesses.\nWe were just about to leave Suiddock when a group of three men blocked our way, brandishing long daggers. They didn't say a word. Just stood there, intent clear.\nI slipped my hand into my coat and showed them my flintlock pistol. My guards, without needing orders, did the same—hands moved to the swords hidden beneath their cloaks.\nThe would-be thieves fled the way they came.\nIt was still early, and I quickly made my way to a safer district like Guilderveld. The trade here looked far more promising, and once again I began inquiring about local prices, presenting myself as a new merchant looking to learn. I gradually steered the conversation toward what truly interested me: who could help me acquire arcane items.\nSeveral times, I was pointed toward a magical emporium. Apparently, there was a mage in the area who enchanted objects. But when I reached his workshop, he simply told me he didn't work without an appointment—and the earliest one available was in three weeks.\nThat left me stuck.\nI kept going like that until midday, going from shop to shop, getting turned away over and over. In one store, there were magical objects, but when I tried to approach one of them, I felt a violent sense of repulsion—as if they smelled rotten. If there was a rogue mage in this city, he worked only by commission. But something else troubled me: every mage I met looked at me with visible surprise.\nFor now, I was managing well. I kept myself under control. But whenever I lost it, the sensations were so intense they forced me to stop, rest a bit, breathe.\nI kept searching. I asked alchemists, mages, apothecaries… I covered most of the district without finding anyone who could help me right away. The fatigue was starting to show. It was getting harder to stay focused.\nI had already explored nearly the entire district. I was about to try my luck in the temple district, as many had recommended, when it happened.\nI lost control of my abilities more than ever.\nA brutal migraine pierced my skull. I was completely overwhelmed by metallic smells—weapons, armor, coins, tools… it all hit me. Every smell was like a blade stabbing my senses, and it felt like my head was going to explode.\n\"Hey, you, back off!\" shouted one of my guards just as I felt a finger press against my forehead.\n\"Someone with your affinity shouldn't be here… or terrible things might happen,\" murmured an old man while keeping his finger against my brow.\nI focused immediately… like that time in my lab when I nearly collapsed. But this time, I noticed something more—something was flowing from the old man's finger into me.\n\"Tha… thank you…\" I muttered, slowly regaining control. \"By any chance… do you have arcane training?\"\n\"Of course not,\" he replied in a raspy voice. \"I'm just a goldsmith… But tell me, what's in that box?\" he asked, pointing to the box of pigments.\nI signaled one of my guards, who took out a jar and showed it to him.\n\"Fascinating,\" the old man whispered, reaching out with his one working hand.\n\"Give it to him,\" I ordered, and the guard obeyed.\nThe old man took the jar with one hand. He observed it closely, as if analyzing a jewel.\n\"Where did you get this?\" he asked, genuinely intrigued.\n\"Do you have somewhere we can speak in private?\" I asked, locking eyes with him.\n\"Of course… follow me,\" said the old man, beginning to limp toward an alleyway. I noticed his other arm hung stiffly, like it was dead.\nWe reached a building incredibly well hidden among Guilderveld's alleys. I ordered my guards to watch the entrance. This conversation wasn't meant for outsiders.\nThe old man hobbled toward a table covered in rings and strange jars. He placed the jar of pigment on the stone surface without a word.\n\"Are you a mage?\" I asked bluntly.\n\"I was. Magister of the Golden College in Altdorf… until I stopped being one,\" the old man answered as he opened the jar. \"Now it's my turn: where did you get this? This pigment resonates with the Wind of Chamon… the wind coils around it… just like it does around you.\"\n\"I made it,\" I answered directly. \"And now it's my turn again. I suppose, being a former Imperial Magister… you must have some amulet or method to control this… the wind around me.\"\n\"I do,\" the old man said, revealing a pendant hidden beneath his clothes. \"But I'm wearing it.\"\nHe fell silent for a moment, then raised an eyebrow and looked at me.\n\"I want to challenge one of your claims. Self-taught, you said? Who taught you?\" he asked skeptically.\n\"I did,\" I replied firmly.\nThe old man gave a soft nasal laugh—more astonishment than mockery.\n\"Would you teach me?\" he asked, his eyes full of genuine interest.\n\"If you give me an amulet that helps hide my affinity for the Wind of Chamon from other mages… and especially from Sigmarite priests, I'll teach you everything I know right now,\" I answered, not breaking eye contact.\n\"What you're asking is unwise… that kind of amulet only hides partially. It's a crutch, not a solution,\" the old man said, shaking his head. \"Young man… you need to learn to control your affinity. It's a wonder you haven't attracted a daemon yet. The wind practically spins around you like a living cloak.\"\n\"I don't have that luxury,\" I replied, gritting my teeth. \"If I go to the College of Magic in Altdorf, they'll make me surrender control of my lands. They won't let me go. Or have you forgotten the terms of your own exile?\"\nThe old man went silent for a few seconds. Then, with a sigh, he nodded.\n\"Yes. I remember. They controlled me too much. Watched me constantly. Now that I'm old, I understand why. My experiments were madness—I tried to combine different winds…\" he said, lifting his dead arm and letting it fall with a dull thud onto the table… revealing that his skin was bronze-colored.\n\"And can you be my teacher?\" I asked.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.Follow current novᴇls on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

And certainly not one so… troublesome,\" said the old man with a tired smile.\n\"Troublesome? You barely know me,\" I replied, staring at him seriously.\n\"You're too young to understand,\" he murmured as he removed the medallion hidden beneath his robe and, without asking, placed it around my neck.\nThe reaction was immediate. I felt an unbearable pressure in my chest, as if something inside me had been violently released. A heavy pressure weighing down on my chest. Deeply unpleasant.\n\"What… did you do to me…?\" I asked with difficulty, the air barely leaving my lips.\n\"You can't understand it yet,\" said the mage, placing a hand on my shoulder. \"The winds of Chamon swirl around you like a vortex. I've never seen such intense affinity—maybe in a White Tower elf… but you attract them more than even my own amulet can conceal. Even now, you're still releasing magic, like an apprentice who has only just awakened.\"\nI tried to say something, but the old man continued, limping slowly as he spoke.\n\"I felt you the moment you approached the city. It was like a tide of magic centered in one place. I thought a cataclysm was coming… and I wasn't entirely wrong. What puzzles me is something else: why haven't daemons found you yet? A soul like yours should attract them like flies to a corpse. Perhaps… someone is protecting you. Some god.\"\nHe stopped in front of me and took a deep breath before continuing.\n\"If I'm to consider you my apprentice, you must know I don't have much time left. I could only teach you the basics—just enough to keep you from destroying yourself. That's why I have to ask you something essential: when did your sensitivity first manifest?\"\n\"Two weeks and a few days ago,\" I answered honestly. \"The sensations were unbearable… they forced me to shut myself in. Going outside was overwhelming.\"\n\"Even more surprising,\" said the mage with a mix of awe and concern. \"Such affinity in so little time, and no daemon chasing you. Someone is definitely protecting you… could it be Sigmar, perhaps? He protects those who fight Chaos. Or do you follow Ulric?\"\n\"I'm a Sigmarite, like my father,\" I replied firmly. \"He fought against mutants and Chaos worshippers wherever they hid.\"\n\"That might explain it,\" murmured the old man. \"You never know who's watching from the other side. Well, I see you've managed some control over your sensitivity. But tell me… can you channel the winds to search for specific things, or do they just overwhelm you?\"\nI shook my head.\n\"I can't. Either I lose control, or I feel nothing.\"\nThe old man clicked his tongue, grimacing slightly.\n\"You're wearing thick clothes… that means you fear oxidizing or melting the metal you touch. Can you control that too?\"\n\"Yes,\" I replied with more confidence. \"I figured it out while working in my lab. I can choose when to oxidize something… or remove rust.\"\n\"Really? That's unusual. That ability usually emerges much later, after years of study. But it makes sense… you developed it to keep fulfilling your noble duties, didn't you?\" the old man asked, reading me with unsettling ease.\n\"That's right,\" I answered bluntly.\n\"And tell me… can you melt metals at will?\"\n\"That's how I made steel. I melted iron and combined it with charcoal while it was still liquid,\" I explained.\n\"Impressive…\" the old man murmured, crossing his arms. \"You have more talent than I thought. And you progress fast. Very fast…\"\nHe turned to his table, pushing aside books and jars.\n\"Let's try this…\" the mage said as he picked up a vial and showed it to me. Inside was a small dull ingot. \"This is lead. One of Chamon's favorite metals. Close your eyes, try to channel the winds. Sense its presence… observe it without looking, get to know it… touch it to feel its texture,\" he added with a smile.\nHe let go of the ingot, and I dropped it immediately as I moved my hand. \"Lead is dangerous if mishandled. It's toxic,\" I replied naturally.\n\"Too much knowledge for someone so young,\" the old man said, bending down with difficulty to pick the metal back up.\n\"Then use your other senses. Try it. I'll stabilize you if you lose control,\" he said, raising a finger.\nI closed my eyes and took a deep breath. As I had done when creating steel, I forced the energy to move within me. This time, I guided it toward my ears and nose.\n\"You're releasing too much. Try to limit it more, or you'll lose control,\" the mage warned, limping in circles around me.\nI nodded silently and obeyed. I imagined lowering the voltage in a circuit, controlling the energy flow. I immediately felt the magic inside me begin to calm… to settle.\n\"Good… perfect. Continue. You're stabilizing on your own,\" the mage said, sounding pleased.\nThen I began to feel it. First my chainmail, then the sword at my side, the coins in my pocket, the rivets in my boots. One by one, the metals around me began to vibrate in my senses. Then I felt the lead. It was duller, denser, but it was there… in the mage's hand. I recognized it by the way it conveyed its weight and density in my mind.\nSlowly, I began to see the shapes. With my eyes closed, I could make out the contours of my armor. I could see the lead ingot in his hand. And beyond that, more. Everything metal in the room became perceptible. But the brightest, the most intense of all, was the pigment on the table. It pulsed like an encapsulated sun, drawing attention even among the sea of metallic objects.\n\"Perfect… you learn quickly,\" said the mage, pleased. \"Perhaps there's hope that I'll leave a good wizard behind before Morr comes to take me.\"\nThen his expression grew more serious.\n\"But my amulet is nowhere near enough to conceal all the winds you attract. So I recommend you avoid Sigmar's temples. Avoid other licensed mages. Not even the Gold College. At least… not for a few years. Not until you learn how to hide what you carry inside.\"\nThat instantly made me tense. I frowned.\n\"That's going to be a big problem… in three months I have to go to court. In Altdorf. Right next to Sigmar's Cathedral and all the damned Colleges of Magic,\" I muttered through clenched teeth, feeling the weight return to my chest.\n\"Then don't go. Seems like a simple solution,\" the wizard said, shrugging as he turned his attention back to the pigment vial with clear interest.\n\"That's not an option. I have a legal dispute with the Margrave of Helmgart. He claims I'm his ward, and therefore that he should be the regent of my lands. If I don't show up to the hearing, I'll automatically lose the case for defying the magistrates. Or… I'd have to pay bribes so large I can't possibly gather the money in time. Which would leave me in the same position as if I were locked away in the College of Magic.\"\n\"Not so simple, I see…\" he muttered, eyeing my pigment. \"But something comes to mind… I have people who owe me favors. I might be able to get you something useful. Useless to most wizards, but perfect for you,\" he said at last, sealing the vial and heading for the door.\n\"Where are we going?\" I asked.\n\"To see a very old friend,\" the mage replied.\nHe didn't speak further, and I simply followed. The old man climbed into one of my carriages and just pointed in the direction we should go. After a few blocks, I realized we were nearing Elftown.\n\"We're going to see an elf?\" I asked as we approached the entrance.\n\"Yes, a very old friend,\" said the mage. \"Have your guards stay outside. We won't be well received if you go in with armed escort.\"\nI nodded, and once we reached the gate, I ordered almost all my escort to remain there, letting only two guards follow us, and even they left their swords behind.\nWe began entering Elftown, and I could feel the piercing stares of the local elves fall upon us. I noticed guards watching from rooftops and walls, and even residents pausing to observe.\nWe walked for a few minutes until we reached a shop beautifully adorned, with a noticeable concentration of magic lingering in the air.\n\"Here we are… help me down… I'm not made for this anymore,\" said the mage.\nI helped him down, making sure he kept the vial with him. He hobbled with effort, and I followed close behind, straightening my cloak.\n\"Well, if it isn't young Hieronymus. To what do I owe the pleasure today?\" said an elf with a smile, speaking in Reikspiel as he looked at the old mage.\n\"Young… yesterday I almost had to convince Morr not to take me with him,\" Hieronymus replied with a cheerful tone.\n\"You mortals… so fleeting… and yet you always seem to forget that,\" the elf said, and then turned to me. \"Ah… I see you've taken on a mortal apprentice. He's quite talented… but he's wearing your—\" the elf narrowed his eyes as he studied me.\n\"You felt it, didn't you?\" said Hieronymus. \"Here he is. We need your expertise to hide this,\" he added, pointing at me. \"Take off the amulet.\"\nI nodded and removed the medallion, instantly feeling the weight in my chest vanish. It was difficult to keep control of my powers.\n\"Impressive… and dangerous,\" the elf said, watching me.\nI noticed glances from outside—several elf guards were peeking in to watch me.\nI put the medallion back on, and the pressure returned.\n\"I need one of your medallions… one of the elven kind, from Ulthuan. A proper one. I need it to suppress all his resonance while I train him. Consider it repayment for that time I saved your life,\" said Hieronymus.\n\"I could've saved myself…\" the elf muttered in another language I couldn't understand. \"With this, our debt is settled,\" he said before stepping into the back of his shop. I heard noises coming from the workshop for several minutes.\nEventually, the elf returned with a medallion stored inside what looked like an expensive container.\n\"Here you have the finest creation I've ever crafted. It's forged from pure ithilmar, extracted from the deep veins of Lothern. I worked it during the equinox, in a workshop lent to me by a colleague in Saphery, under the indirect supervision of a librarian from the White Tower of Hoeth. May his name remain unspoken, as he requested.\"ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nHe passed his finger over the spiral engraved on the surface.\n\"The spiral isn't decoration. It's a dissolution glyph, etched in silver during the full moon's rise. It doesn't block magic… it redirects it. Folds it inward.\"\nHe turned the medallion with two fingers, revealing the back.\n\"The crystal you see here is a Star Crystal from Cothique. Very old. It fell from the sky—or so my people say. It captures and disperses the Winds around it. It doesn't eliminate them, but it makes them… confused. Unsteady. Diffuse like fog over an open sea. Anyone unable to see past the surface will notice nothing,\" the elf concluded.\n\"Go on, try it,\" said the mage, placing the pigment vial on the elf's table. The elf examined it with intense curiosity.\nI changed medallions and immediately noticed a difference. The massive pressure in my chest faded, replaced by a faint, nearly imperceptible one.\n\"Much better…\" said Hieronymus. \"I can barely sense you now. A bit more training and you'll be ready.\"\nI looked at the elf, who had opened my vial and was doing something with his hand, visibly amazed by the pigment.\n\"Could this serve for ink in enchantments…? Very fine material. The best thing you've ever made,\" he said to the mage.\nBut the old man only shook his head and pointed at me. \"I teach him magic, and he teaches me alchemy… an equivalent exchange,\" he said with a smile.\n\"The Chamon resonance is strong… it will be useful for many fine enchantments,\" said the elf, still marveling at my creation.\n\"Master elf…\" I said respectfully, \"could I acquire some of your goods… like those—?\"\n\"NO… mortal,\" the elf cut me off. \"My dealings with Hieronymus are because he saved me from a daemon during an elven rune expedition. But I would never sell Ulthuan magic items to a human,\" he said, crossing his arms.\n\"Well, I must go now… I need to pick up a few more things,\" said the mage, stepping out of the shop, and I followed, silently cursing the elf.\n\"Well… one more stop and we return to my lab,\" said Hieronymus.\n\"Where are we going?\" I asked.\n\"Back to Guilderveld. I need tools,\" the old mage replied, limping ahead.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I was still cursing that damned elf… there were so many magical items I could've bought, and that arrogant bastard hadn't allowed it.\nWe returned to Guilderveld's commercial district, and this time Hieronymus led us to a smithy run by dwarfs. The place had plenty of customers and was sweltering, though I found the heat oddly comforting… magic was changing even my preferences.\nHieronymus stepped inside and approached a bronze-bearded dwarf flipping through books and jotting down notes.\n\"Is your father in?\" the wizard asked directly.\nThe dwarf looked up sluggishly and answered flatly, \"Yes, in his forge.\" Then he went back to his books.\nThe dwarven forge radiated immense heat, but it didn't bother me. In fact, I liked it. Hieronymus walked quickly despite his limp, weaving through the many workers. It didn't take long before we reached a more isolated section of the workshop, where powerful hammer blows echoed loudly.\nThe sound continued even as we entered, until we saw a white-bearded dwarf working a piece of glowing metal on an anvil. The hammer stopped, and Hieronymus gestured toward him.\n\"There he is. The only smith I know who makes runed items in human sizes,\" said the wizard.\nThe dwarf turned, took off a glove, and stroked his beard thoughtfully.\n\"What can I do for you, alchemist?\" he asked as he approached, eyeing us both carefully.\n\"I need some special components for alchemy,\" Hieronymus replied.\n\"The usual? Reinforced vials?\" the dwarf asked.\n\"No, this time it's a bigger order.\" Hieronymus turned to me. \"Tell him what you need for your creation.\"\n\"And how are you paying?\" the dwarf asked bluntly.\n\"You brought imperial crowns, didn't you?\" Hieronymus said, turning to me.\nI nodded silently, and he turned back to the dwarf. \"Imperial crowns.\"\n\"You expect me to pay for this?\" I said, staring at Hieronymus.\n\"You've got a cart full of gold. Did you forget what I taught you? I can feel the gold from here… besides, do you think what I got for you came cheap?\" he said with a cheeky grin.\nI sighed, stepped forward, and replied, \"I'll pay.\"\n\"So, what do you need, pup?\" the dwarf asked, now focusing entirely on me.\n\"One moment, honored one,\" I said, then turned to Hieronymus and whispered, \"I was planning to take you back to my territory… I can't stay here.\"\n\"If I set foot in the Empire, bad things could happen to me… very bad things,\" Hieronymus muttered, locking eyes with me.\n\"I can teach you much better things. What I did earlier was basic. I can do far more complex things,\" I insisted in a low voice.\nHieronymus's eyes widened. \"Then that's settled. We're going back to the Empire.\" He turned to the dwarf. \"Sorry, Durgan. Seems your services won't be needed after all.\"\nThe dwarf scowled deeply. \"Wasting my time… alchemist,\" he muttered, turning back to his anvil.\n\"Wait… master dwarf. I would never pass up the chance to improve my personal laboratory with items crafted by a professional like yourself,\" I quickly interjected.\nDurgan turned back again, this time with a slight smile on his lips.\n\"What do you need?\" he asked.\n\"Alembics, resistant flasks, reinforced jars… I don't mean to insult you with the question, but… can you make items with coatings to prevent contamination of reagents?\" I asked cautiously.\n\"What do you take me for, pup? Of course I can. You're not the first alchemist I've worked with,\" he said in a deep voice.\n\"The thing is, I work with very strong acids, master dwarf… some can corrode metal in seconds. While I've managed to prevent my metal trays from dissolving, I'd appreciate sturdier pieces,\" I said in a formal tone.\n\"I can do it,\" he nodded confidently.\n\"I also need…\" I began, and spent the next five minutes listing very specific and complex tools used in alchemical practice.\nThe dwarf nodded silently, stroking his beard as he memorized each item.\n\"Want runes on any of them?\" he asked once I was done.\n\"I know nothing about dwarven runes, master… so I leave that entirely to your discretion,\" I replied politely.\nThe dwarf nodded and stood silently for a moment.\n\"6,000 crowns for everything you asked for, pup,\" he said.\n\"Excellent. It's never a waste to pay for the best equipment available. When could I come to collect the items?\" I said with a genuine smile.\n\"Next month, it'll all be ready, pup,\" the dwarf replied, his smile growing wider. It seemed my attempt to flatter his ego was working.\n\"Of course… wait, I can't miss the opportunity… weapons? Armor? Preferably something I can take right now,\" I said, the leather of my gloves creaking as I laced my fingers together.\n\"Let me guess, you want runed armor? I've got some leftover pieces, but I only sell minor runes,\" the dwarf said, leading us to the back of the forge, toward what looked like a storage area.\nIt was packed with swords, rings, and armor—though most of it was dwarf-sized.Follow current novᴇls on NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n\"Not much in your future size, pup, but I hope you find something of interest.\"\nMy attention went straight to the rings.\n\"Hmm… I wouldn't recommend those, pup. If I size them for your current fingers, you'll have to come back several times so I can keep adjusting them,\" said the dwarf behind me, as I inspected the large number of rings on display.\n\"Certainly, master dwarf,\" I replied, and began focusing slowly on the Winds of Chamon, trying to sense the metals around me to see if it helped with the search.\nI could feel a strong presence of the Wind here as well. All the artifacts glimmered and resonated clearly, but the dwarven armor stood out above the rest—there was something more powerful within them.\n\"Do you have bracelets with concealment runes?\" Hieronymus asked.\n\"I've got a pair,\" the dwarf replied, pointing to a section of the armory where several pieces were carefully hidden from view.\n\"Boy, take them. That should help you completely,\" said Hieronymus.\n\"Five hundred crowns,\" announced the dwarf without flinching.\n\"I'll gladly pay it,\" I replied, stepping closer to the bracelets. I moved the fabric of my clothes and fastened them over the chainmail I was wearing. As I did, I felt a slight pressure in my chest, like an invisible hand trying to calm the winds surrounding me.\n\"And what about this chainmail? It'll be too big for me, but I think I can make it work,\" I said, pointing to a full-sized adult piece hanging among others.\n\"Two thousand crowns. Chainmail with minor runes of protection, fortitude, and light warding,\" the dwarf explained in a professional tone.\n\"I'll take it. Do you have a gambeson?\" I asked.\n\"I don't normally work with fabric…you would have to be made a order, pup,\" the dwarf replied.\n\"Do you have something to protect me in case something goes wrong in my lab?\" I asked while looking at the armor.\n\"Then you might be interested in what alchemists usually request… there, you've got a pair of protective gloves, one rune against fire, another against poison; there's also an apron with a containment rune, boots with traction and weight balance runes, and protective goggles with clarity and eye-warding runes. The whole set goes for 3,500 crowns,\" said the dwarf, pointing at each piece.\n\"I'll take it. How much for a runed sword?\" I asked, eyeing the exposed set of blades.\n\"Those aren't for sale, pup. I don't think you could even use them properly. You're too young, even by manling standards. You haven't even grown your first beard hair. I wouldn't feel right selling something that dangerous… my ancestors wouldn't approve. But I can sell you anything for your protection,\" the dwarf replied in a grave tone.\n\"I understand, master dwarf. I suppose that will be all for now. I'll wait until I'm no longer a human pup before using your services again,\" I said, keeping my tone formal.\n\"Alright then… 12,000 crowns, pup. You hand it over, and I'll get to work,\" said the dwarf, arms crossed.\n\"Right away. Let me give the order for the boxes,\" I replied, stepping out of the storage room.\nOutside, I instructed my men to bring in several crates full of gold coins. They handed them over to the dwarf's son, who simply accepted them and gave me a receipt number I would need to collect the goods next month.\nAfter that, I packed away my newly acquired runed items, and we headed back to Hieronymus's lab.\nWe quickly began packing everything the wizard deemed important. We filled my carts with grimoires, notes, dozens of scrolls, rare minerals, strange gems, and many sketches of what seemed like failed experiments involving the fusion of the winds of magic.\nWe began clearing out the workshop. I opened a door looking for more books, but Hieronymus slammed it shut before I could get a good look inside. I had barely caught a glimpse of what looked like a crib covered in cobwebs.\n\"There's nothing of value in there… just one of my greatest failures. Not worth mentioning,\" said the wizard in a strangely quiet voice.\nSoon after, Hieronymus changed into a colorless cloak and placed a dark mask over his eyes.\nI nodded, saying nothing more. We packed the rest in a hurry and, using the last light of day, returned to Suiddock to secure a ship back to Schilderheim.\nThis time, I was much more alert. I walked with my pistol in hand under my coat, ready to shoot the first idiot who tried something. Given the late hour, I noticed the docks were full of gang members and thugs watching us with greedy eyes as we made our way to the ships bound for the Empire.\nSoon, a crowd of these fools began to gather, flashing knives and daggers. I drew my pistol, bracing for a very one-sided fight in terms of numbers.\nI felt a vibration beside me. I saw Hieronymus lift his hand in a strange gesture and recite, \"Ferrum fiat plumbum, iussu Chamonis,\" while making several finger movements.\nWhen I turned to see what he had done, I noticed the glow from the thieves' weapons had vanished. Many had dropped them due to their weight, and those still holding them struggled to lift them.\nYou didn't need to be a genius to understand what had happened—and the thugs weren't geniuses either. They realized immediately there was a wizard with us, and they fled, leaving chunks of lead where there had once been steel.\n\"Latin?\" I asked, looking at him incredulously.\n\"No? Lingua Praestantia… the tongue of wizards. Wait… wait… you understand Lingua Praestantia?\" said Hieronymus, visibly surprised.\n\"A bit… I caught 'iron', 'lead', and 'Chamon?'\" I replied calmly.\n\"Hmm… stop shining so much, looks like I only have to teach you the basics and you'll figure out the rest on your own,\" the wizard muttered, narrowing his eyes at me.\n\"Hey, idiot, what are you doing showing off your ability in front of my men?\" I whispered sharply.\n\"They're trustworthy, right?\" Hieronymus replied, shrugging with his only good arm.\n\"Of course they are. That's why I brought them,\" I said firmly.\n\"Then you worry for nothing,\" the wizard answered with complete calm.\nWe continued on without further trouble, finally reaching the ships bound for the Empire. With some luck, no one would notice that a wizard had cast a spell so close to the harbor.\nWe paid for our passage, loaded the cargo on board, and departed. Once again, I had trouble sleeping properly—but this time it was far more bearable than the first.\nThe voyage was shorter than the last. This time we were returning, and that seemed to make the journey lighter. We arrived by late afternoon the next day. To my surprise—or perhaps relief—my guards were still waiting at the inn where I had left them, patiently awaiting my return.\nOnce ashore, we unloaded our goods and paid the port's disembarkation fee. It was quite expensive, especially for transporting runed items forged by dwarfs.\nWe immediately began the journey back to Reinsfeld without stopping. We avoided crowded roads and passed every village. I couldn't risk drawing unwanted attention—not with a wizard at my side who had invoked the winds of Chamon in the middle of Marienburg.\nWe rode back from Schilderheim on horseback. It was already night when we entered the castle as quietly as possible.\nOnce inside, I gathered the guards who had accompanied me to Marienburg and handed each of them a pouch with 25 crowns.\n\"Nothing that happened these past days took place. If I hear you talking about it, I'll have you hanged,\" I said, staring at them just as they were beginning to get too cheerful about their pay.\n\"You've got the next three days off. Enjoy them,\" I added before turning and walking into the depths of the castle, listening to their cheers behind me.\nI helped Hieronymus up the stairs. All the staircases in the castle had steps of varying sizes, forcing anyone going up or down to look down constantly, or they'd fall.\n\"Oh… the sensation is getting stronger,\" said Hieronymus with a huge smile, clearly excited by the amount of Chamon wind present.\nWe finally reached the top of the tower, where my laboratory was.\n\"It's simpler than I expected… far too basic. I think mine was more complete,\" said Hieronymus, eyeing everything critically.\n\"Let's see, old man… what matters is what I've got up here,\" I said, tapping my temple with two fingers.\nHe was clearly excited, so I decided to get started immediately.\n\"First lesson: the table of elements,\" I said, grabbing one of my notebooks, along with a quill and inkwell.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I've become much more sensitive to it, now able to detect the winds—something I couldn't do before. Until recently, I could barely use them, and always clumsily, with almost no control at all. But my good magical master made sure I read several grimoires—most of them focused on the process of containing magic within oneself—reducing my magical signature as much as possible. According to him, this would make it much harder for a priest to detect me as a magic user.\nHowever, the first thing Hieronymus wanted to teach me was how to shut my mind against divination, even before sharing any truly important knowledge with me. He never explained why, but he insisted that I had to learn to block any possibility of being seen by wizards or demons capable of predicting the future.\nAfter that, I taught him the full process for producing my blue pigment. While I studied from grimoires, he took charge of the pigment production, using the magic of Chamon to compensate for the lack of his arm while handling acids and grinding certain ingredients. I had no complaints: I had someone teaching me magic and, at the same time, producing large amounts of pigment effortlessly. He was far more productive than I was. he spent several hours perfecting scrolls, attempting to enchant some of my alchemical tools to make them more efficient, and using the pigment as a reagent.\nAs for the problem with the margrave, a small detachment was spotted on the roads with clear intentions of seizing Reinsfeld in a swift attack. But the attempt didn't go unnoticed. When they encountered my pikemen in formation, with their pikes braced to halt the knights' charge, they realized the vast difference in numbers… and retreated the way they came. Since then, no more forces from the margrave have been seen. Perhaps he's too busy dealing with orcs, bandits, or the Bretonnians to invest in a direct fight against someone more powerful than he originally thought.\nThrough Rutger, I've already made contact with the Altdorf lawyers' guild, hiring a good number of them to focus solely on finding jurisprudence, forgotten laws, or any legal loophole that might help my case. At the same time, I've sent multiple gifts to the judges: silk, jewels, chests full of gold—all delivered as gestures of goodwill. Let them understand that I support their legal careers and that\nAnd with the arrival of the alchemical equipment from Marienburg, my small laboratory was starting to run out of space. Between the two of us, we nearly tripled the previous weekly output, and each week it seemed more and more people were buying our pigments. Apparently, they were much easier to obtain than waiting for a caravan from Cathay to travel all the way to the Empire, or dealing with dwarfs who sold their product at an absurdly high price.\nAdded to this was the constant—uninterrupted—progress of my city's construction and the ever-increasing migration. For some reason, people from all over the Empire kept arriving. At this point, even with the Elector Counts already warned of this \"opportunity,\" it should have stopped long ago. But something—I don't know what—keeps drawing the masses. And if this continues, soon Reiklanders might become a minority in their own land. Discontent was already brewing: complaints were rising in the taverns, where people spoke of my administration's \"favoritism\" toward foreigners—building them houses, giving them tools, food, even making them the first to benefit from the sewer system.\nIt hasn't turned into a revolt yet, but the complaints are frequent. We'll have to keep an eye on that. Still, crime hasn't increased. In fact, we haven't arrested anyone in over two months. So, at least for now, I suppose everything remains under control.\nThe bell in my office rang, pulling me out of the numbers. I rang the reply bell, and soon one of my vanguard men entered, bowing his head.\n\"My lord… your vassals Rudolf and Hanzel have arrived. They bring with them a force of men-at-arms,\" the guard informed me.\n\"A rebellion?\" I asked as I reached for my arquebus and matchlock pistol.\n\"No… no, my lord. This is the time of year when your father organized the great beastman hunt, to clear the forests and prevent them from gathering near the farmlands… Your vassals come to fulfill the orders of the late baron,\" said the guard quickly, trying to prevent me from making a mistake.\n\"Ah… right. Well, it wouldn't hurt to calm the peasants' fears about the mutants. A quick campaign against the beastmen might help ease tensions,\" I murmured, now more thoughtful.\nI immediately went down to the courtyard and authorized my knights to bring in their men.\nAround seventy showed up. As expected, the quality of their equipment varied greatly. Chainmail was the most common; few had breastplates or more complete armor. At the very least, my own troops were already showing a clear difference, with better gear directly funded by me. But by feudal rights, I had little authority to impose standards on my vassals' equipment.\n\"Rudolf… I'm glad you came,\" I said in a friendly tone, extending my hand.\n\"It is my duty, my lord baron. Just as I served your father, so too shall I serve you, in all that I can,\" replied the knight, bowing his head.\n\"I see you've purchased a better suit of armor, haven't you?\" I said, noting the steel breastplate and finer gauntlets than I remembered.\n\"I've been saving for this, my lord. One never knows when a good piece of steel might be needed between oneself and an enemy,\" he replied with a slight smile.\n\"I suppose you're Hanzel, correct?\" I asked, turning to a man with a still-youthful face who stepped forward and immediately knelt.\n\"Don't you think it's a bit late to come swear fealty?\" I asked, watching him closely.\n\"My apologies, my lord… News of your father's death reached me late. I only learned of what happened recently. My deepest condolences… but due to the lack of communication, I only found out when a merchant from your lands passed through mine,\" he said, with a tone that seemed sincere.\nThere was a clear difference in wealth between both knights. Hanzel wore little more than a leather cuirass reinforced with iron. I watched him for a few more seconds, then nodded.\n\"Don't worry too much… it's not your fault, I suppose. Very well. I have a short campaign in mind this year against the beastmen. As I hope you're aware, I'm currently in conflict with the margrave, and he even attempted an attack. We can't stray too far from the castle, or we might run into trouble if the margrave decides to try something… amusing,\" I said, observing their reactions closely.\nBoth knights clearly looked surprised.\n\"I'll summon three hundred of my men. That should be enough for a decent purge this year.\"\n\"Ah… my lord, but… wouldn't that leave the town defenseless? Reinsfeld has only four hundred guards, if I recall correctly,\" Rudolf said with some concern.\n\"Then you recall wrong. I increased the number recently. We now have fourteen hundred, and I'm considering raising it further,\" I replied, staring straight into his eyes.\n\"How?\" said Rudolf, incredulous.\n\"Let's not waste time with idle talk. I found a way to obtain gold, and now I have enough… for the time being. That's why I'm still alive. If I hadn't hired more men, the margrave would already have me locked up in Helmgart,\" I answered firmly.\n\"I see,\" murmured Rudolf, and Hanzel nodded silently.\n\"Very well. We leave in an hour. I'll gather supplies, and we'll head into the woods.\"\nWith that, I began organizing the essentials: we loaded carts with grain, bought salted meat, baked bread, and other provisions from the local market to feed the troops joining me on this campaign.\nTo the north of my lands stretched an immense forest. It was said to harbor a sizeable beastman population that constantly harassed my villages. I imagine my father made their lives miserable, given his reputation as a bloodhound when it came to hunting those creatures.\nOnce supplies were ready, I chose the guards who would accompany me: a mix of veterans who had served under my father and soldiers from my own regiment. While many were trained to fight in formation with pikes, this forest campaign would serve to teach them how to fight in rough terrain, where the long reach of their weapons could become more a burden than an advantage.\nWe entered the northern forest, where recent logging had opened a narrow wound into the sea of trees. We began our search, hoping to stumble across a beastman patrol… or with luck, an entire camp.\nWe moved for several minutes through roots, branches, and underbrush. I carried my dwarven spear in one hand, my arquebus in the other, and the pistol secured tightly on my chest, alert to any movement. But the hunt was proving… frustrating. During all that time, we found only one of the beasts, and it was alone.\nCompared to the margrave's forests, this was a pathetic catch. It seemed I hadn't inherited my father's nose for mutant tracking.\n\"Wait… yes, I have,\" I muttered to myself with a grin.\nI let the winds flow through my senses and began searching using my amplified abilities to detect iron—specifically the rough, jagged scraps that beastmen used as improvised weapons or armor.\nWhen I felt the vibration of corrupted iron, I turned my head.\n\"There they are,\" I said quietly, looking toward a denser patch of trees. I hadn't seen the beastmen yet, but I had sensed their weapons and metal gear.\n\"What is it, my lord?\" Rudolf asked, riding beside me.\n\"We move that way… I think I saw tracks,\" I said, pointing at the ground.\nThe knight nodded without question.\nWe advanced through the forest, dodging branches and roots, cautiously approaching the camp. I could feel the vibration of all the metal they carried. The beastmen had caught our scent and were preparing to ambush us.\n\"Ready yourselves,\" I murmured, gripping the matchlock pistol firmly.\nMy men began looking around in all directions, tense, while the knights' men-at-arms closed ranks into formation.\nA gor came roaring from behind a tree, raising its axe in a savage fury. But I was already waiting. I had the pistol aimed right where it appeared. I fired without hesitation.\nThe lead bullet tore through its neck with a dry crack, leaving a hole so large you could see clean through to the other side of its torn flesh.\nControlling my mare after the recoil, I grabbed the arquebus and aimed at a tall bush. There I sensed another chunk of iron… a machete.\nA moment later, an ungor leapt from the foliage, only to take a shot square in the chest. The lead smashed through its heart and dropped it instantly.\nWith both weapons spent, I pulled back and let my men engage the next wave of beastmen charging toward our position. I watched as many of the creatures impaled themselves directly on the pikes, making no effort to avoid them. The ambush they had planned became their downfall.\nThe terrain made it impossible to form a continuous pike line as in open field, but many were positioned in pairs or trios, and that was enough to stop the wild assault. The men-at-arms fought with determination, and the crossbowmen had already begun firing from the rear, turning the forest into a slaughterhouse of mutant blood and corpses.\nI kept firing whenever I could, making sure to keep my men informed of any presence of iron I sensed around us.\n\"Beastmen to the rear!\" I shouted, detecting the unmistakable vibration of metal approaching from behind.\nMany of my men turned, seeing only trees and brush, but I ordered them to prepare regardless. We shifted several pikes to the new front and placed men-at-arms ready to intercept whatever was coming. Pistol in hand, I waited.\nThen they emerged. Another group of gors and ungors burst from the undergrowth, roaring furiously—once again failing in their attempt to ambush us.\nWasting no time, I blasted the brains out of one of the larger beastmen with a clean shot, the echo rumbling through the trees. The chaos didn't last long. I kept giving clear orders, maintaining discipline while my troops repelled the assault.\nThe mutants fell in droves. The pikes pierced their bodies easily, and the crossbow bolts tore them apart before they could even reach the lines. Every time I sensed a new metallic presence, I shouted its direction, allowing my men to maneuver swiftly.\nThe forest, once quiet, had become a killing ground for the creatures of Chaos.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The beastmen are no match for the brave men of the Empire!\" I shouted as another horde of those abominations emerged from the trees, howling like rabid dogs.\nWith a mix of pikes at the front, swordsmen on the flanks, and crossbowmen at the rear, we pushed slowly but steadily through the forest, always choosing clearings where we could maneuver and maintain discipline.\nSo far, we had slaughtered several small groups of gors and ungors hunting in the woods. Some wore tattered Imperial armor stained with mud and dried blood. Others still had strips of human skin hanging from their leather belts. One even wore an Imperial helmet, poorly fitted over his deformed snout.\nIn one clearing, a group of fifteen beastmen charged us at once. They bellowed with rage, frothing at the mouth, raising rusted axes and splintered swords high above their heads. The pikemen, perfectly formed, braced their pikes into the ground. The line didn't move.\nThere was only the sound of steel meeting flesh.\nSeveral ungors were impaled completely, skewered from gut to spine in a single blow. Their flesh tore as they struggled to pull free, only to drive the shafts deeper. A larger gor was caught with one pike through his thigh and another between his ribs, squealing like a slaughtered pig as he tried to bite through the shaft.\nThose who didn't die on impact were left hanging like butchered animals—grotesquely impaled, convulsing as blood poured from their mouths. Some of my men-at-arms flanked and finished them with thrusts to the heart or the base of the skull.\nOne of my soldiers, covered in viscera, raised his sword after slicing open a gor's belly. The entrails spilled out with a wet, sickening splatter, the stench so foul that a few younger troops vomited on the spot.\nWe kept moving. The vibration of iron through my senses led me to an even denser concentration. After crossing a muddy slope, we found what looked like their main camp: an open hollow before a cave.\nIt was an infernal sty.\nPiles of human and animal bones were scattered across the ground, mixed with excrement, feathers, dried blood, and knife marks carved into opened skulls. Human skin had been stretched like leather over rotten wooden frames. A cow's head with several knives stuck in it served as a makeshift altar. The stench was unbearable.\nSeveral of my men covered their noses. Others stared with grim expressions.\nI quickly noticed most of the camp's population had already fallen in the earlier clashes. Only a handful of gors and ungors remained—clearly younger than those who had ambushed us. Many still lacked chest hair or bore no ritual scars.\n\"Form up in the center of the camp! Crossbowmen, ready your weapons!\" I ordered without hesitation.\nAs one, my troops moved into position. The men-at-arms formed a compact wall of shields and pikes, while the crossbowmen took position behind with bolts loaded.\nThe remaining beastmen, desperate and furious, charged mindlessly. One after another, they fell—impaled by pikes or shot through the skull or gut. One tried to dodge and got tangled in the bodies of his kin, earning a clean stab to the throat. His blood sprayed the face of the man-at-arms who finished him, who didn't even flinch.\nThe ground turned into a mix of mud and black blood. The air grew thick with the scent of rusted iron and torn flesh.\nWe advanced toward the center of the camp, maintaining formation. Each step left behind deformed corpses, disemboweled bodies, and the remnants of profane rituals. The screaming stopped. Silence fell suddenly. An uneasy silence—as if the forest itself was holding its breath.\nThen came the roar.\nI turned toward the sound—and saw him.\nA massive gor, nearly three meters tall, emerged from the cave entrance. His body was covered in scars, skin stretched over muscles taut as cables. He wielded two enormous axes, one in each hand, still dripping with old blood. Hanging from his belt were human skulls, some with tufts of hair and skin still attached. Across his chest, he wore a dented, rusted plate armor, marked with the sigil of Khorne.\nThe creature stared at us with eyes red as burning coals.\n\"Scheiße...\" I muttered, pistol already in hand. That cursed spawn was the leader.\n\"PIKEMEN, PIVOT! CROSSBOWMEN, ON MY MARK!\" I shouted, just as the monster let out another savage roar and began its charge. The creature hurled itself toward us with inhuman speed, roaring as if driven by the unholy god himself.\nThe beast smashed into the pike wall like a demonic ram. With its axes, it shattered several pikes in the first swing, splintering wood and cracking iron through brute strength. But broken shafts were quickly replaced, and the soldiers held the line, pushing forward.\n\"Flank him! Don't give him a second to breathe!\" I yelled at Rudolf, who was already moving on the left.\nThe massive gor, now soaked in his own blood, kept fighting—cleaving through spears, driving his axes into shields, closing the distance more and more. Shallow cuts crisscrossed his flesh; deep wounds bled from his shoulders and thighs, but still he pressed on.\nWe surrounded him, closed ranks around him—but still he did not yield.\nFrom the rear, I kept trying to reload and fire my arquebus whenever I had the chance. One bullet hit his head… and bounced. Another struck his chest… the armor cracked, but held.\nAt last, I managed to shoot him in the neck, ripping out a deeper, guttural howl that made nearby horses rear in fright.\nBut then everything fell apart.\nThe beast, still bleeding from hundreds of cuts, finally closed the distance. With a violent swing of its axe, it decapitated a soldier—his head flew like a ripe melon. The next was cleaved from shoulder to hip, a stream of hot blood drenching the three pikemen beside him. Terror nearly broke the formation.\n\"HOLD THE LINE!!\" I roared.\nThen, a spear—thrust from a blind angle and pierced just behind the gor's knee, tearing through tendons. The monster dropped to its knees with a guttural, furious roar.\n\"REFORM THE LINE!! KILL IT!!\" I shouted immediately.\nLike a net of steel, the soldiers surrounded the creature. Pikes and spears jabbed from all angles, sinking into its tough flesh, piercing ribs, shoulders, back. The beast kept swinging, trying to kill with its last breath, but it had no strength left. Every movement slowed. Every roar faded.\nAt last, what felt like an eternity ended when the monstrous bestman collapsed, a final breath escaping as a dull grunt before its body trembled… and went still.\n\"Don't touch anything!\" I barked, seeing a few men step forward to finish it off. Silence fell instantly.\n\"Just burn the body. And secure the area… I don't want anyone setting foot near that corpse until a priest is brought in. This reeks of a site of unholy worship,\" I said, pointing my spear toward the cave entrance from which the leader had emerged.\nI dismounted. The smell from inside was damp… and rotting. With a dozen men-at-arms, I advanced toward the entrance. My senses—sharpened from practice with the winds of Chamon—immediately alerted me: irregular iron vibrations, faint movements… someone was inside.\nOne of my men lit a torch. We stepped into the cave without a word. Each step echoed off the stone, and the stench grew more unbearable with every breath.\nAs we advanced, the floor became uneven and slick. The walls bore marks of dried blood, bone fetishes, human skin stretched like trophies. In a wider chamber, a pile of human skulls rose against one wall.\n\"How quaint,\" I said coldly, raising an eyebrow at the carefully stacked white skulls.\nWe pushed deeper, until at the very end we found them: a small group of beastwomen, hunched and cowardly… and human women. All of them visibly pregnant.\n\"These abominations nourish the ranks of the filth that plagues our lands,\" I murmured, observing them. Some of the human women already bore signs of corruption—evident in their eyes and skin. The beastwomen tried to hide, retreating into the darkness, whimpering like wounded animals.\nBut I didn't see victims. I saw incubators of future horrors.\n\"Kill them all. Then burn the bodies. Leave nothing standing,\" I ordered, turning sharply and walking out of the cave. Behind me, the echo of steel against flesh rang out briefly—followed by muffled screams… and then, only silence.\nOnce the hunt at this location was complete, we felled trees to start burning all the beasts' corpses.\nIt took us a couple of hours to gather all the bodies. The pile was grotesque: twisted limbs, broken horns, splintered ribs. Black flesh slick with drying blood, still warm. The pyre rose like a monument to extermination. We kept tossing logs onto the flames, and soon the fat from the corpses began to feed the fire on its own.\n\"Seems you've done a fine job, honorable baron,\" said a voice… that voice.\nI turned sharply. It was the priest of Sigmar. I hadn't seen him arrive.\nMy left hand flew to the amulet hidden beneath my armor, brushing the small pendant that contained my magical signature. My right moved to the runic bracelet that masked the same.\n\"Uh… ah… well…\" I stammered, evaluating every possibility. Silence him. Make him disappear. Fabricate an accusation.\n\"I believe so… servant of Sigmar. The beasts that haunted these lands have fallen… though not without the blood of righteous men,\" I finally said, trying to sound solemn while my mind coldly calculated scenarios.\n\"There's no need to be nervous.\" The priest smiled. He placed his hand on my shoulder. \"Your father would be proud of what you've done today. With the death of a wargor, this forest may know peace for a while… if you continue to act under Sigmar's will.\"\nThen he withdrew his hand and nodded with respect.\n\"Now it's my turn. I'll perform the rituals to purify this land, if you'll allow it, baron.\"\nI nodded silently, saying nothing. I watched him walk toward the pyre with his prayer book and censer.\n\"He didn't notice?\" I murmured. \"I think not… this elven trinket works,\" I whispered, touching my chest. I stood still as the priest began his litany.\nI took a deep breath. I hadn't felt fear like that since I heard the drone buzz that claimed my life and brought me here.\nMuch more confident now—knowing my amulets could shield me from the priest's detection magic or Chaos-sensing charms—I remained a silent observer as everything was burned. The beastmen's bodies, their totems, tents… all was consumed in fire, leaving nothing behind.\nOnce the camp had been broken down and rest began for the day, as I waited for the priest to ride back to the village, I released my magic and began to sense more of these beasts' camps.\nThe iron's vibration stirred again… not far from here.\n\"Well, looks like this little cleansing is going to become a full-scale purge,\" I said with a smile.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Because if not…\"The witch hunter slammed the table.\"THAT WOULD BE HERESY! TREASON! AN OFFENSE AGAINST DEUS SIGMAR!\"\nI didn't flinch. At first, simply having one of them in front of me—with his feared amulet, his gaze like knives, and the threat of a purge behind every word—had pushed me to the edge of losing composure.But now, I was calm.\n\"As I said, faithful servant of Sigmar… in my duty as a noble of the Empire and representative of the moral and spiritual values that Deus Sigmar bestowed upon his children, I made sure the mutant threat was eradicated.My men, steadfast in their faith, destroyed every one of those abominations, cleansing our forests of their unholy presence. For days, we hunted and destroyed their lairs.Everything was burned. Every body, every trace… For the glory of Deus Sigmar. For the glory of the Empire.\"\nThe witch hunter stared at me in silence. He didn't blink.Without warning, his hand slammed the table again.\"BUT NOBODY TOUCHED THOSE HERETICAL WEAPONS… DID THEY?!\"\n\"No one,\" I answered firmly. \"I personally ordered that everything be incinerated the moment the battle ended. Not a single soldier, not a single servant dared touch anything.The local priest blessed the ground, recited the proper litanies, and oversaw the entire process.He inspected everything. Even the men, to ensure they bore no corruption.\"\nI saw the witch hunter smirk faintly. But it wasn't relief.It was the smirk of a man who thinks he's found a crack.\n\"Ah… but young baron, you'll understand that I find it suspicious you know… with such precision… the procedures of our order regarding corrupt objects. How do you know all that?\"Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nI paused for a moment, keeping my gaze steady.\n\"The writings of our Lord Magnus the Pious make it clear. When he defeated the Champion of Chaos, he ordered that every sword, armor piece, or corrupted relic be purified with fire and litanies.I read that in my youth. I followed it, as any loyal son of the Empire is taught to.\"\nThe witch hunter narrowed his eyes. He murmured something in a low, judging tone—barely audible.Then he lifted his amulet—that symbol of faith which had sealed so many fates—and brought it close to me.\nI felt a faint tingling. A slight sting, like static electricity brushing against my skin.But nothing happened.\nThe silence stretched for a second.The hunter lowered the amulet without breaking eye contact.\n\"You understand, baron… burning a beastmen altar is not without consequence. The putrid magic they try to channel—when released—seeps into the ground.It clings to stone. It could have cursed the entire forest, turned your own men into prey for that corruption.You were lucky a member of the clergy was present. Otherwise…\"\nHe paused deliberately, as if waiting for a reaction.\nBut I had fully regained my composure.And I smiled.\n\"With all due respect, the altar was burned only after the priest arrived. Not before.He himself performed the ritual, recited the proper litanies, and only then used consecrated fire.He was meticulous, as dictated by the Cult's codices.\"\nI took a breath.\"And yes, it drew the attention of the beastmen. Quite effectively. My vassals used to kill around two hundred a year, as my father did.This week, under my command… over three thousand fell.\"\nI bowed my head slightly in respectful gesture.\"And our casualties can be counted on bot hands. A great victory for Sigmar… and for his eternal Empire.\"\n\"Seems I received poor information…Many of your men couldn't agree whether you burned the totem before or after killing the wargor,\" said the witch hunter at last, his eyes still locked onto mine.\nThen he lowered the amulet and sighed.\n\"My apologies for the ordeal, young baron. But it's protocol.One doesn't come across a wargor in corrupted armor every day. I had to ensure everything was handled properly.\"\nI nodded slowly, without lowering my gaze.\n\"I understand. And I appreciate your zeal, servant of Sigmar.After all, we all serve the same god… and fight for the same Empire.\"\nThe witch hunter didn't respond. He simply put away his amulet, adjusted his coat firmly, and said\"Your valiant act will be reported to the Cult.\"\nHe left without another word.\nI waited a few seconds, motionless, listening to the sound of his boots echoing off the stone—until the last step faded completely.\nOnly then did I release the breath I hadn't realized I was holding.\n\"Phew… that was close…Damn it… who would've thought they'd bring in the witch hunters just because of the Khorne symbols on the armor…\"I muttered to myself, brushing my chest, feeling the amulet still pulsing gently beneath my clothes.\n\"Damn elf… But I'll admit, he makes good amulets,\" I grumbled, adjusting the collar of my shirt.\"If it could fool a witch hunter who looked like a veteran, then I'm safer than I thought.Maybe I was just being paranoid…\"\nI stepped out of the ruins we were using as a camp.\nThey seemed to be remnants of some walled settlement—likely an imperial outpost or a small fort abandoned years ago.Some structures still stood: old moss-covered stone walls, the remains of a fallen tower,and a couple of barely-standing houses.But it was enough for our needs—a solid base of operations.\nThe most interesting thing was that the beastmen no longer needed to be hunted.They came to us.\nIt seemed the death of the wargor and the burning of the totem drew their attention like flies to a corpse.All I had to do was return to the main camp, bring in more men from the regiment, reinforce the pikes… and wait.\nAnd there they were.Blinded by fury, charging our lines like diseased cattle.\nThanks to my magical sensitivity, I could detect the iron they carried: their axes, machetes, improvised armor. That vibration revealed their position before they even got close enough to shout. We were always prepared. Always in the right place. Always with the pikes ready.\nAnd so, one by one, we took them down.\nRudolf was ecstatic with the outcome of this campaign. My father used to hunt between two and three hundred beastmen a year—barely enough to keep their numbers low. But what we were doing was a massacre. If we continued at this pace, I might actually wipe them out completely from my woods.\nOf course, if everything kept going as well as it had so far.\nThe hardest battle, without a doubt, was the wargor, or when an entire herd—about three hundred beasts—crashed into our forces. That day I lost seven men.\nConsidering that in the previous two days I had only lost two, it was a high number.\nBut it was still a bargain: realistic, brutal, and necessary training for my men, without needing to plan costly skirmishes. As long as I was nearby, I could anticipate ambushes and manipulate the terrain to favor our positions.\nBut I couldn't afford to lower my guard.\nThe margrave was surely paying attention. And as much as I loved cleansing my lands of Chaos, I couldn't leave a thousand men patrolling the woods when a direct attack on my castle—which was not exactly a fortress—could end everything.\nIt was time to return.\nThe interrogations with the witch hunters ended without incident, and we began the journey back.\nThe first thing I did upon arrival was hand over the bodies of the fallen to the Cult of Morr. I wanted them to have a proper funeral rite, more elaborate than a simple litany and a few coins on the eyes. I requested a public ceremony, so that their families could say goodbye to those who fought and died under my command.\nAs the procession was prepared, a bitter sense of guilt crept over me.\nNot because of the number of dead—nine soldiers wasn't a tragedy in strategic terms—but because of what it meant.\nI was used to being sent to die. Not to being the one giving the orders that led others to it.\nI still thought like a soldier. And empathy weighed on me more than it should.\nI didn't go personally to deliver the news. I have neither the patience nor the words to speak with a widow, or a father broken by loss. But I gave a clear order: that their closest comrades deliver the message, and that they leave more than just words of comfort.\nFor each of my fallen men, I promised to continue paying their full salary for fifteen years. Or until one of their descendants was old enough to work. Then, that pay would go to him… if he chose to serve under my banner.\nWhen a stranger dies with a sword in hand, the world keeps turning. Maybe someone remembers him in another city, or a woman curses him for not returning. But here, in my lands, when a man recruited from a village under my protection dies…\nPart of his home dies too.\nThey were fathers, older brothers, only sons. People who brought bread to the table. I could not—would not—allow a single order of mine to condemn an entire family to misery.\nI stayed until the end of the rite.\nI watched in silence as the priests of Morr chanted their litanies and blessed the bodies solemnly. Each name was spoken aloud. And when the incense smoke began to fade, I withdrew quietly.\nThe day went on as usual.\nI walked through the site where the blast furnace was being built. Each day taller, each day closer to completion. The structure of brick and stone was starting to take shape.\nThen I visited the new housing area.\nThe first homes were already finished, and I wanted to be there when their new owners crossed the threshold. The handovers didn't go as initially planned. I didn't distribute the homes by origin or province. No. I chose to mix them. People from Reikland, Talabecland, Wissenland, and Nordland living door to door. Forcing integration that I knew would be uncomfortable at first… but necessary.\nThere were already enough dividing lines in the Empire. I wasn't going to allow more in my lands.\nI saw the blacksmiths in their forges, sweating between flames and steel, and the soap makers keeping their production steady.\nNone of them knew that, just a few days away, we had wiped out a horde of Chaos.\nThat the blood of beasts still stained roots in the forest.\nBut that was fine. Ignorance, in this case, was a blessing.\nThe town carried on with its life.\nChildren laughed, markets were set up, and minor cultural conflicts continued as if nothing had happened. As if everything remained the same. And that was exactly what I sought.\nAs I prepared to return to the castle and begin pigment production—I needed funds, and a lot of them—I already had in mind which judges to send gifts to, what names I needed to memorize, and whom to buy off.\nBut as I reached the foot of the hill, I found a large trade caravan blocking nearly the entire ascent. Wagons, pack animals, servants, merchants… it looked like a damn fair set up right outside my home.\nWith my men, we simply skirted around them from the flank, ignoring their protests, until an older man stepped forward from the group and tried to get my attention.\n\"My lord…\"\n\"Tomorrow,\" I said, without stopping.\n\"I am your grandfather, the father of—\"\n\"I know. My answer is the same: tomorrow,\" I said, without even turning around.\nThe old man tried to follow, insistent, but my guards lowered their spears, blocking his path with the same professionalism they had shown against any beastman they'd faced in recent days.\nWhen the castle gates finally opened, I passed through without looking back and went straight to the upper levels.\nI had a mage who needed my mind… and a formula that demanded perfection.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

They use their sense for metal merely to detect immediate threats or to track enemy weapons... but you've extended it as if your very skin were attuned to the hidden veins of the earth. That's uncommon.\"\nI merely nodded as I hung the heavy cloak and began undoing the clasps of the protective gear the dwarf had sold me. My back still ached from hours of fighting among twisted trees and treacherous roots.\n\"I was thinking... is it possible to use the iron in blood to detect people who aren't carrying any metal?\" I asked quietly, more to myself than to him.\nHieronymus raised an eyebrow.\n\"Ah… using your mundane knowledge to skip steps. Not bad. It is possible, yes, but extremely difficult. Only those deeply in tune with Chamon can feel the iron within. It's an exercise in absolute sensitivity. The wind of metal does not flow through blood as it does through a breastplate or sword. It's... more subtle. Even I have yet to master it—only occasionally can I feel a trace of it. But if you succeed... even if it takes thirty years, you would be the youngest wizard in history to do so. In fact, you're already the youngest I've ever met capable of detecting metals so easily when drawn by Chamon.\"\nI sat down beside the stone bench and stretched.\n\"When this affair with the margrave is over, I'll have time. If I can fully pacify my lands, I'll be able to devote myself entirely to your grimoires.\"\nHieronymus let out a dry laugh.\n\"You sound so certain of victory. But tell me, what will you do if the judges receive more generous gifts than yours? The margrave controls a vital trade route. Even if you sell your pigment for its weight in gold, you're limited by how much you can produce. And every time you leave the lab to hunt or fight something, that's a day you produce no income—in fact, you lose money every time you're not in your castle, considering your considerable expenses.\"\n\"I don't have his costs. His thousands of soldiers must be paid month after month. He must protect merchants, fight bandits, maintain clean roads. Even his beast hunts are investments... though, yes, he does make a lot from them,\" I said, scratching my chin. \"I earned a thousand crowns in a matter of days, just by pointing out where the beasts were hiding.\"\n\"And if all else fails,\" said Hieronymus with a crooked smile, \"you'll at least have the consolation of heading straight to Altdorf. You could study among the wizards of Chamon and wouldn't have to suffer that old bastard's whims. You might even become the Golden Apprentice… with what you know and your affinity for Chamon, the masters would fight over who gets to be your mentor. I have no doubt you'd become the leader of the Gold Order.\"\n\"I won't let that wretch steal what's mine. Though… speaking of inheritance… my family is outside. They're waiting for me.\"\n\"I thought only your father was still alive?\" the wizard asked, curious.\n\"My maternal grandfather. It has to be him. My mother left me at birth, or so I've been told. Apparently, she was terrified of my father. And well… I can't blame her. He was the kind of man who killed first and asked questions later. But honestly, I couldn't care less.\"\nHieronymus sighed and shook his head, as if something weighed on his heart. \"Some squander what others yearn for all their lives…\"\nI stood up, brushing the dust from my doublet.\n\"Today, the carpenter is supposed to have the paper press ready. If he doesn't, I'll hang him at the village gate. I'm tired of his incompetence. I should've asked the dwarf smith from the start… with that and a shipment I'm expecting from Rutger, I'll show you something that will drive Imperial alchemists mad,\" I said while fastening my leather gloves. \"And it will, without a doubt, make me the richest man in the Empire… if I can produce it in large enough quantities.\"\nHieronymus raised his eyebrows with an expression he rarely showed: genuine excitement.\n\"What is it? Come on! At least tell me what material you used, or whether it's based on something you've already shown me. Come now, boy, don't leave me in suspense…\"\nI smiled, savoring every second.\n\"Ah, ah, ah… excessive curiosity killed the wizard,\" I said, sliding on my mail shirt before pulling the doublet over it. The weight barely registered now. It felt like putting on another shirt. I fastened my belts, checked that my amulets were properly hidden beneath the cloth, and touched the dwarven bracelet I never took off.\n\"I rely more on these artifacts each day,\" I murmured as I closed the last clasp, \"and with so many witch hunters in the region… I can't afford a single mistake. We've killed enough beasts already for some fanatic to assume I summoned them myself.\"\n\"They'll think it anyway, whether you did or not,\" Hieronymus replied with a shrug. \"But if what you say is true, and this invention of yours works… you'll need even more protection than before. Gold doesn't just attract envy. It draws in guilds and nobles eager to ensure their fortunes don't lose value.\"\n\"Bah… that's a problem for the future, honestly,\" I muttered as I descended to the great hall of the castle. I went down the stone steps, passed through hallways lined with old banners—some already faded—and sat in the chair where my father used to receive guests.\nI ordered them to let him in.\nI remained in complete silence, resting one elbow on the carved wooden armrest, my hand on my chin, staring at the door as the minutes dragged by.\nFinally, the great wooden doors opened with a creak.\nHe entered, escorted by my guards. He wasn't alone. At least four people accompanied him: a woman in her thirties with an air of importance; two young men—about my age, maybe slightly older—well dressed, with upright posture; and an older man, wearing a colorful silk robe and holding a staff he clearly didn't need.\nMy eyes passed over them all. Luxurious clothes, well-fed faces, refined manners. They didn't look like people who struggled for money. Most likely the family who paid my father to marry a commoner. They clearly had no shortage of crowns.\n\"My dear…\" the old man said with a wide smile, opening his arms as if he still had some right over me, as if the blood we shared still gave him authority.\n\"You don't have permission to speak to me,\" I replied curtly, without breaking eye contact.\nI leaned back slightly in the chair, crossing one leg over the other. The backrest creaked faintly under my weight. I wanted him to feel every second of silence like a rope tightening with each blink. Only the tapping of my fingers against the oak armrest could be heard.\n\"Why have you come?\" I finally asked, not altering the rhythm of my fingers.\n\"My dear grandson…\" the old man repeated hesitantly.\n\"I am the Baron of Reinsfeld,\" I interrupted again, with the same steady tone I used to read decrees. \"And this time I'll overlook your breach of etiquette out of courtesy. But if you do it again, I'll have you whipped publicly in the square like any other commoner who forgets his place.\"\n\"My lord… my apologies,\" said the old man with an awkward bow. \"I assumed—wrongly—that this meeting would have a more cheerful tone.\"\n\"Well, you assumed poorly. Answer the question.\"\n\"I came to offer my condolences for the death of your father… my lord,\" said the merchant, lowering his gaze for a moment.\n\"That could've been done at Morr's temple, like everyone else,\" I replied coldly. \"Kneel, leave two coins, mutter a prayer, and vanish.\"\nI then noticed the woman beside him — sharp-featured, dressed in ostentatious silks — frown and lean in to whisper something to the old man, clearly annoyed.\n\"What did she say?\" I asked calmly, directing the question to one of the guards nearby.\n\"She said you have the same temper as your lord father, my baron,\" the guard answered without hesitation.Follow current novᴇls on\n\"Thank you,\" I said with a nod, staring at the woman until she averted her gaze. \"I take that as a compliment. He was a good example… or rather, my only example.\"\nThe old man sighed heavily. His tone shifted.\n\"My lord, I don't mean to waste your time. I'm here with a business proposal,\" said the merchant at last, the smile now gone.\n\"Ah… now we're speaking the same language,\" I replied, straightening slightly. \"Tell me, merchant… what offer do you bring me? I hope the sound of your coin justifies the interruption.\"\n\"This is something we had already discussed with your lord father,\" the old man explained. \"It was never finalized, partly due to the beastmen attacks in the region where we planned to invest. And later, well… the baron had some severe mood changes.\"\n\"Yes. He was a man who didn't tolerate nonsense,\" I murmured. \"Continue.\"\n\"As you may know,\" the merchant went on, \"we are textile merchants established in Schilderheim. Our family has lived off wool and linen for generations. We operate several looms and workshops that supply both Altdorf and Marienburg. We also own lands used for sheep grazing nearby.\"\nI nodded silently. My eyes never left him.\n\"The proposal was to relocate all our infrastructure to one of the smaller villages under your jurisdiction. We would bring with us our workers, their families, animals, and tools. We'd establish a new textile center in your land, under your protection.\" He paused. Waiting for my reaction.\n\"So far, all that sounds like a blessing for my coffers,\" I said at last. \"So tell me, old man… what was the trap that made my father slam the door in your face?\"\n\"We were negotiating the grant of a generous amount of land to establish grazing fields for our sheep… and land in one of the minor villages to build the structures for the looms,\" the old merchant explained, now more cautiously as the atmosphere cooled.\n\"And a tax exemption, I assume,\" I said without looking up.\n\"Indeed, my lord. Only for two years. Just enough time to move everything, settle in, and recover the initial investment.\"\n\"Curious…\" I muttered under my breath, resting my elbow on the throne's armrest and narrowing my eyes. \"For now, it still sounds like a favorable deal.\"\nThen I raised my voice: \"Anything else?\"\nThe merchant adjusted in his seat. The woman next to him watched him with unease, as if she already knew what was coming wouldn't be well received.\n\"We were also discussing the possibility of obtaining a monopoly in the lands of the late baron,\" the old man said more carefully, \"to avoid future competition and, in essence, to prevent local producers from entering that field.\"\nI cut him off with a sharp gesture.\n\"No. That will not happen,\" I said bluntly. \"I'm not granting a monopoly of that size to anyone. Nothing guarantees me that you won't raise prices to the maximum once you secure exclusivity, drain the land I grant you and its people until there's not a drop of value left. No. There will be competition. Always.\"\nThe old man nodded with regret, saying nothing for a moment.\n\"And… well… I also wished you would consider taking my two grandsons, sons of my firstborn, as knights in your court,\" he said finally, as if trying to sneak in a minor request.\n\"Knights?\" I repeated, raising my voice, the trace of mockery barely concealed. \"Ah, now I understand… now it all makes sense. The tone, the forced courtesy, the parade in silk.\"\nI leaned back slightly, letting a smile form on my face.\n\"Do you know how many protocols must be followed to grant such a reward? How much blood, how much merit is required before a name becomes worthy of bearing sword and crest as a knight?\"\nI leaned slightly forward, staring him down.\n\"Nobility isn't bought, merchant. You're born into it… or you earn it through deeds so noble the title is won, not begged for. And you expect to achieve that with a handful of sheep and cloth?\"\nI held back a laugh.\n\"Your lord father considered it… it's just that…\" the merchant began to say, but his voice trailed off as he looked away.\n\"Just that?\" I asked, raising an eyebrow. Seeing he didn't respond, I repeated more firmly: \"I said, just that?\"\nThe woman beside him, her expression severe and dress immaculate, stepped forward and replied with contempt:\n\"That beast wanted me to bear him more children.\"\nI stayed silent for a few seconds. Then I turned my head slightly and looked at her in complete silence.\n\"Hmm… hello, mother.\" I examined her carefully.\nShe scowled at the word, but I didn't stop.\n\"Though you are noble by marriage… don't you ever insult my father again,\" I said in a serious tone.\n\"That monster you call father? He beat me! He humiliated me! He did it without rest while I carried you in my womb, you ungrateful child.\" Her voice trembled with rage and resentment, as if she expected compassion.\nBut I gave her none.\nI turned again toward the old merchant. \"Old man… did she remarry?\"\n\"No…\" he answered cautiously, but I cut him off immediately.\n\"Then listen carefully. I'll send your grandsons as squires to one of my vassals. In five years, if they survive and fulfill their duties, they'll have full rights to become knights.\"\nThe merchant's face lit up for a moment, but my words weren't done.\n\"But there's a condition. I want your blessing — though I don't need it — to send this woman… to a monastery of the Cult of Shallya. Let her take a vow of chastity. Let her become useful to others, since she never was — and never will be — useful to me.\"\nThe woman turned sharply, her eyes wide with surprise.\n\"Father? What are you doing?! Tell him no! You promised me a marriage with a decent nobleman!\" she cried, desperate.\nThe old man didn't answer right away. He closed his eyes for a second, took a deep breath… and finally spoke with a grave voice: \"Done.\"\nWithout another word, I removed the glove from my right hand and snapped my fingers.\nTwo guards stepped forward immediately and seized the woman as she began to scream and struggle.\n\"No! You can't do this to me! I'm your mother!\"\n\"Take her to Shallya's chapel. Let the priests prepare her for the journey to Altdorf. As of today, she stops being a political problem for me,\" I said with a smile.\nAs her screams faded down the castle halls, I calmly sat down and put my glove back on.\n\"Now that we've removed distractions… let's talk numbers, merchant.\"\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

They're near the area where you raise the horses you sell, my lord,\" my grandfather replied with a more serene tone, though he still weighed every word.\n\"Settled, then. We'll be able to allocate a few hectares so you can tend your sheep without issue,\" I replied as I unfolded one of my father's dreadful maps. Barely scribbles on parchment, but enough to get a general sense of the terrain.\n\"I was thinking…\" the merchant continued, now with a slightly more cautious voice. \"My lord, I've considered setting up the workshops here, in the main town, instead of the one you previously suggested. I've noticed a massive increase in population, which would be highly favorable for local sales. And during the days I was waiting, I saw a lot of movement from Marienburg merchants, and even some Bretonnians. They use your bridge to cross the river and take advantage of the local market.\"\nI looked up from the plans, stared him directly in the eye, and smiled — though my voice grew firmer. \"That changes the terms of the deal, old man. It's not the same to settle on wasteland as it is to move into my urban core, where I've invested heavily in infrastructure. If you want that land near the paved road and the bridge, I'll need something in return.\"\n\"Something in return?\" he repeated, frowning.\n\"A slice of the business,\" I answered bluntly, folding my hands atop the table.\n\"A slice?\" he repeated again, this time with a graver expression.\n\"Yes, of course. I'm offering you land that gains value by the day thanks to my works: the sewer system, the pavement, the market, the security. When everything is finished, that land will be worth ten times what it is now. So I consider it fair that a quarter of your profits fall into my hands.\"\nMy grandfather's face hardened. He pressed his lips together and frowned before speaking. \"Between the regular taxes and what you're asking, you'd be taking nearly half my business without lifting a finger, my lord.\"\n\"A privileged position and the security that only an Imperial noble can provide are extremely valuable assets in your line of work, old man… surely you understand that better than anyone, don't you?\" I said, calmly interlacing my fingers.\n\"I don't think so, my lord… it's too much,\" my grandfather replied, trying to maintain composure.\n\"Well… and here I thought we were family,\" I murmured with a sarcastic smile. \"But alas, you can't have everything.\"\nJust then, I heard footsteps approaching. The grand door to the hall opened and Rutger appeared, frowning.\n\"My lord… why is there a lunatic screaming outside the castle?\" he asked, pointing toward the entrance.\n\"My mother,\" I replied flatly, raising an eyebrow. \"She's not thrilled about going to the convent. But I prefer that to having half the Empire sending suitors to claim titles through my blood. As you can see… she's not taking it gracefully. But such is life. Some are slaves to their fate… and others, the rare few, grab it by the throat and force it to yield.\"\nI turned to Rutger.\n\"Did you bring what I asked for?\"\n\"Yes, my lord. I have everything. There were difficulties with the cotton, especially… I spent a thousand crowns to bring as much as possible, just as you ordered,\" he replied.\n\"Perfect. Leave it by the stables. I'll give you the goods to sell this week later.\" I stood up, and Rutger withdrew with a slight bow.\n\"Who is that?\" my grandfather asked, his tone cold, as if he'd seen an old enemy.\n\"Him? That's Rutger Breeke, a merchant from Marienburg. He's now my servant and salesman. He handles the distribution of my products throughout the region.\"\n\"That job could be done by my trading company,\" the old man said, pride in his voice.\n\"I know… and I prefer that it doesn't,\" I answered without looking at him. \"Why change something that works? That bastard probably hates me with every fiber of his being… but I'm the only one allowing him to grow rich by selling goods of extraordinary value. He's bound to me by necessity. How long will that leash last? Who knows.\"\nThen I looked directly at him, gave a dry smile, and concluded: \"Now go do what you need to do. I have real work to attend to.\"\nI left the hall without giving him a chance to respond, escorted by my guards. The sun was already high, and as usual, I had to oversee the food distribution among the poor… but there was something more urgent that day.\nI went directly to the carpentry workshop. I needed to confirm whether they had finally finished what should've been ready weeks ago. As I approached, I saw the apprentices and laborers working as if Sigmar himself were breathing down their necks. The master carpenter was there, visibly nervous.\n\"My lord…\" he said upon seeing me, bowing clumsily.\n\"Craftsman…\" I replied in a dry tone, crossing my arms. \"I hope this time everything is ready. My patience with your incompetence is running thin.\"\n\"Yes, yes… it's ready. Everything is finally ready!\" he said, nearly hyperventilating. \"The press you ordered… the ejector lathe… the three wooden hammer machines, the shredders, the smoother and the refiner. All of it, just as you ordered, my lord,\" he added proudly, pointing at the machines.\nI walked up slowly, evaluating the wood, the joints, the metal parts — everything. It didn't look refined, but it was solid.\n\"Good… it looks close enough to what I had in mind. Now show me that it works. The press was the most complicated.\"\nThe workers moved quickly. One hooked an iron chain to a rotating post, another secured the test pulp inside the press. They began to turn. The chain tightened, and the mechanism began to creak with force.\nIn a matter of seconds, the apple was completely crushed. It turned into pulp and juice before my eyes. The sound of wood and iron working in unison was… satisfying.\n\"Took you long enough, didn't it?\" I said, looking at the carpenter, who was relaxing a little too much.\n\"I'm sorry, my lord… it's the most complicated thing I've ever worked on,\" he replied, lowering his head.\n\"Good… now I need you to build looms. Twenty of them. It's an urgent order. I hope that won't be a problem,\" I said in a dry tone, watching the carpenter.\nThe man began to grit his teeth — an instinctive reaction that revealed his ignorance. He clearly had no idea what I was asking for.\n\"As for your fee, send me the bill. I'll pay you this very evening… if you manage to deliver the estimate before the day ends,\" I added, staring at him.\n\"Yes, my lord… I'll do my best to have your new order ready soon,\" he answered, eyes wide, as if I had challenged him to build a cathedral with a rusty hammer.\nI nodded briefly and waited while his workers began disassembling the press mechanism. Once everything was loaded onto the carts, we departed for our next destination.\nAs we left the workshop, I passed the area where a few stragglers still remained in the food distribution line. I took the opportunity to make a job offer.\n\"Five of you. Easy work. Pay at the end of the day,\" I announced in a loud, clear voice.\nI scanned them quickly. I didn't need the strongest ones — just those available. I selected five immediately: young men with alert eyes and no visible wounds on their hands. With them, I headed toward the industrial sector of my town.\nAs always, the noise there was constant. Smiths hammering without rest, the air filled with the smell of fresh mortar and boiling soap. I greeted one of the guards with a nod, then turned aside to inspect the blast furnace under construction. The architect had kept his word: his crew was still hard at work, laying bricks and securing beams. The structure was coming along well.\nThen we descended to an area I had prepared in advance: the future paper workshop. A rudimentary building — just the foundations and some basic structures — but functional. I had commissioned this from architect Otto weeks ago, and being a reliable man, the settling pools and fermentation pits were already complete. There were trenches with gates to control the river flow, allowing the deposits to be filled or drained with ease.\nI led the five workers to the piles of old linen, shredded rags, and discarded clothing that the people usually donated to the Temple of Shallya. This time, it had all been collected in my name. For most, it was just garbage; to me, it was raw material.\n\"Your task is simple,\" I explained. \"Take the rags, cut them into small pieces with these blades. Nothing should remain whole. Then, into the soaking pit. Enough water to soak them, but not drown them.\"\nI supervised for a few minutes while they began cutting, then moved toward the ejector lathe. It had to spin continuously to shake out the dust and dirt from the damp linen. Once installed, I checked it myself. Next in the line were the shredders.\nThanks to the waterwheel connected to the river —effective idea brought by Otto's contacts, though expensive — the axle began to turn. The wooden mallets with nails of various sizes began their slow, swing. They weren't yet at full capacity since there was nothing to grind, but the mechanism was working. It was only a matter of days before the entire line would be operational.\nWhen the mix was ready, already turned into cellulose pulp, it would be poured into the water pools. There, the suspension would allow the fibers to be captured with special molds. The water would drain away, leaving only a thin, uniform layer — the shape and thickness of the paper defined by the mold used. Then the press would be activated: firm pressure to remove the remaining water… and afterward, sun drying.\nFor now, the five workers were focused on cutting and filling the first pit. I supervised the final installation of the press, we mounted the rotating post and secured the chain. We turned the test lever — it worked. Everything was nearly ready.\n\"Well… all that's left is for the production line to start running, and gold should start flowing through the paper,\" I murmured to myself, watching the installed press.\nThe whole process had only cost me the initial investment. The raw material was free: old rags and used clothing, all donated in my name to the Temple of Shallya. The water, of course, came from the river. There were no recurring expenses beyond manual labor — and that was cheap these days. This was a solid investment.\n'I just need to maintain a population high enough to generate a steady flow of discarded clothing and rags. If that holds, this business will be the most profitable of all. And now that the carpenter finally knows what he's doing, scaling up production will be trivial.'\nWith everything in place, I left the workshop satisfied and returned to the castle. I could finally focus on what truly interested me.\nI headed toward the area where the soapmakers worked. I personally collected a large amount of the glycerol I had ordered them to extract during the saponification process. They had done a good job. The dense, viscous liquid was stored in thick glass jars. I loaded it myself onto a small cart and took it to the castle.\nUpon entering, I paused briefly to inspect what Rutger had brought.\nA mountain of cotton bales, stacked in the warehouse. He'd had to import them from Araby, and the cost had been high — but the quality was excellent. Alongside them, several sacks of saltpeter from Nuln, carefully sealed.\nNow, finally, I could begin moving small quantities of each material into my personal laboratory. I ordered my guards not to let anyone else inside. I tied on my reinforced leather apron, put on my alchemist gloves, my darkened glass goggles, and wrapped a damp scarf over my face to block the fumes.\nThen, I sent for my wizard.\nHieronymus arrived shortly after, curious as always.\n\"Watch closely. I'm going to show you how to attract the winds of Chamon with the finest alchemy you'll ever witness,\" I said, confidently.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It should be done under very controlled conditions, especially regarding temperature. So, we'll do part of it here and the other part in the castle dungeons. If the heat rises too much… they'll be finding pieces of us all the way in Morr's temple,\" I said, calmly tightening my gloves.\n\"Heh, heh, heh… I like this… I haven't done anything this radical in a long time. My heart's pounding like it did in my youth,\" Hieronymus replied, a genuine smile of excitement on his face.\n\"Alright, let's start by turning our cotton into cellulose. It's not too different from making paper. Linen would also work, but here we need to use the purest raw material to get the best possible result,\" I explained, tossing a bundle of cotton into a cauldron and pouring in a generous amount of lye.\nHieronymus took a seat, opened a small notebook, and started writing, glancing up only to check that what he was recording matched each of my actions.\n\"That's it. This needs to rest for a couple of hours. So we move on to the next step: sulfuric acid. You already know the whole process. In this case, it's our base acid to turn it into something much more useful,\" I said, holding up a sealed flask containing two liters of the liquid.\n\"Now, two parts nitrate to one part sulfuric acid. We'll use four kilograms of nitrate. It goes into the still. We must keep the temperature consistently low so the vapors from the reaction condense along the pipes of the dwarven still. The dwarf did carve a rune to help stabilize the temperature, but we still need to be careful. We don't want this burning,\" I added, removing the still from the flame to avoid overheating.\n\"And now... through the pipes, our liquid begins to condense. Voilà… nitric acid,\" I said with a smile, watching with satisfaction as the drops slowly fell into the flask.\nHieronymus simply nodded in silence, clearly fascinated by the process.\n\"Now we just have to wait for everything to condense… and for the cellulose to be ready,\" I added, stirring the contents of the cauldron with a wooden rod as the cotton began to dissolve.\nSeveral hours passed. While the still worked to produce as much nitric acid as possible, we washed the treated cellulose with hot water and laid it out to dry in the sun. I didn't have hydrogen peroxide for more thorough bleaching, but it would do for now.\nWith a large amount of nitric acid and several kilograms of treated cellulose, we descended to the coldest part of the castle: the dungeons. Cold, damp, and isolated, they offered the optimal conditions to continue the experiment. By midday, we slipped past the guards, who paid little attention. No one questioned why their lord and his financial advisor were pushing a cart full of jars, tubes, and sealed containers into the lower levels.\nThe air grew denser as we went down. The scent of moisture mixed with wet stone, and darkness engulfed everything. Only the metallic tapping of Hieronymus' cane and the squeaking wheels echoed on the stone floor.\nSuddenly, the sound of rattling chains echoed in the distance. Then, a guttural scream tore through the silence.\n\"YOU! BASTARD! I'LL KILL YOU! WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE I'LL SKIN YOU ALIVE!\" bellowed a familiar voice. A chained man hurled himself at me with all the fury his bonds would allow. He didn't get far.\nHe looked emaciated. He'd lost weight since arriving, and his eyes gleamed with a mix of rage, hunger, and desperation.\n\"Friend of yours?\" Hieronymus asked, tilting his head and raising an eyebrow.\n\"Him?\" I replied without even glancing. \"No. Just an idiot who thought he could control my destiny. Funny, isn't it? Now his life depends on me.\" I smirked as one of the knight's men, also in chains, lowered his gaze in resignation.\nHieronymus nodded silently, as if it were nothing more than a passing curiosity.\n\"Let's move on. The human drama can wait. Ours cannot,\" I said, pushing the cart deeper into the dungeons, toward the castle's torture room, now chosen as our lab for its low, stable temperature.\nOnce inside, I began the setup. I placed a large clay vessel in the center and carefully lined up the flasks containing the acids and treated cellulose.\n\"Now… two parts sulfuric acid—preferably distilled a couple of times in a still—and one part nitric acid. We'll fill the container as much as we can; we need to produce as much as possible. We've invested a lot of time making these acids,\" I explained as I poured the mixture slowly, making sure not to spill a drop.\n\"Don't you have an idea for processing more acid?\" Hieronymus asked, rubbing his beard with his knuckles. \"If it's just the two of us working, I doubt this can be produced on a large scale… unless very little is needed.\"\n\"Indeed,\" I replied, not taking my eyes off the mixture. \"I do have some ideas. A larger still to increase yield per batch, for one. But for now, we're limited by space and castle resources. Once I stop burning every damn crown on bribes, wages, and feeding Otto—who's like a leech draining me dry—then maybe I can think about a proper lab… someday.\"\nI looked up and asked, \"Do you think your dwarf friend could build me a lab from scratch in the mountains?\"\n\"Yes, but he takes his time. And he charges a fortune. What you pay in bribes is pocket change compared to what he'd ask for what you're imagining,\" Hieronymus answered without hesitation.\n\"Ugh… dwarves do good work, sure, but they never justify what they charge. Damn it,\" I grumbled, pouring in the last of the acids.\nThen I took one of the trays of dried cellulose. I looked at it for a moment. The air in the cell was thick, saturated with corrosive vapors floating like invisible ghosts.\n\"Now we pour in the cellulose, little by little… and if you believe in anything, start praying. This is where we could end up as puddles of blood,\" I said quietly, feeling the tension rise as I approached the container.\nHieronymus didn't reply. He just nodded with a wide grin on his face.\nI began pouring in the cellulose.\n\"Sulfuric acid is here to trap water. Its role is to absorb the water released during nitration. That prevents the nitric acid from diluting, since it loses potency when mixed with water. We need each hydroxyl group in the cellulose to react with a nitrate group. Once the cellulose is nitrated… we'll have nitrocellulose, which is highly explosive,\" I said with a smile, watching as vapor began to rise from the container.\n\"Some kind of throwable explosive...? Wow… do you feel it?\" asked Hieronymus, narrowing his eyes.\n\"Yes… they're all around us,\" I replied in a low voice, noticing how the winds of Chamon were starting to swirl around us.\n\"That means it's working. You've created something that attracts the winds of Chamon,\" murmured Hieronymus, scribbling everything down frantically, wearing the expression of an alchemist on the verge of revelation.\n\"Not yet… we need to wait a bit longer until everything is fully nitrated,\" I said, keeping my eyes on the mixture. Heat, pressure, and magic seemed to intertwine in the air.\nAfter about fifteen minutes, I started removing the cellulose using a clay tool. I pulled out white and yellowish fragments and took them to the wash basin, rinsing them over and over with distilled water. When that was done, I repeated the cycle: add more cellulose to the acid, wait, extract, wash. I kept going until all the material we brought had been nitrated.\nAs I carefully cleaned the container, Hieronymus watched me in silence. Then he asked:\n\"Is this still usable?\" he said, pointing to the acid residue at the bottom of the container.\n\"It can be reused. The acids have different boiling points, so we can separate them again in the still. They'll be ready to use again… though I wouldn't use them to nitrate cellulose anymore. Organic residues could alter their properties, so I'd reserve them for other purposes,\" I replied while pouring the contents into labeled flasks.\n\"Like what?\" Hieronymus asked, genuinely curious.\n\"Red pigment, yellow pigment… I could make mirrors. Or fertilizers… yes, I could use it for that,\" I said aloud, as new ideas rushed through my mind.\n\"Interesting. So many things you can do… I have so much to learn and so little time… Why couldn't I have met you sooner?\" murmured Hieronymus, frustrated. Then he looked at me sideways. \"So… what about the glycerol? The stuff you brought from your soap makers.\"\n\"I'd rather not touch it for now. I wanted to make cordite, but that means nitrating glycerin… and the temperature needs to be even lower. It's a very powerful explosive. If we try it here, we could destroy half the castle if something goes wrong. So better not. When I've saved enough gold, I'll pay that dwarf to build me the perfect lab of my dreams. For now… I'll settle for this smokeless powder,\" I said while finishing storing the flasks.\n\"That's what we made? Smokeless powder?\" asked Hieronymus, surprised.\n\"Yes. It's more powerful, but also more unstable. Cordite is more controllable, but it needs more specialized equipment and even colder temperatures. And honestly, I don't want to explode,\" I replied with a slight laugh.\nI took several clay trays and spread the nitrocellulose out to dry in the shade, in a nearby cell.\nWith the rest of the equipment, we returned to my lab in the castle tower. I dedicated myself to slowly separating the acids, heating the mixture with care and collecting the fractions through condensation, then storing them again in clean, labeled flasks.\nThe rest of the night was spent cleaning the liters of acid we had used. It was tedious and exhausting, but necessary to avoid any disaster when storing the leftovers.\nIn the morning, we continued synthesizing more nitric acid. The idea of making fertilizer was tempting. If I could develop greenhouses, I could start growing cotton locally, without relying on expensive imports from Araby. I'd be the Empire's only producer of a vital raw material for cellulose, while also making use of the future looms I planned to build.\nAlthough I honestly have no idea how a greenhouse works—glass panels and irrigation is about as much as I understand. But I doubt it's that simple. Still, if I can make it work, it's a profitable business. Cotton sells for around a hundred crowns per ton unprocessed. But what matters to me is that it would provide a steady source of nitrocellulose. It could also be used to grow food in winter, which would sell very well among nobles eager for fresh vegetables.\nWhile I thought over what to do, I headed to the place where I left the nitrocellulose drying. I chuckled a bit at the knight, still as combative as the day before, and began grinding the dry nitrocellulose fragments with a mortar, avoiding any sharp blows and simply working them into a fine powder. I immediately sealed it in glass jars to avoid any unwanted reaction, since it was more powerful than black powder and more volatile if not stabilized with nitroglycerin.\nOnce everything was finely ground and stored, I went to the training field, where many of the men-at-arms in my service were practicing. Today, I started testing my dwarven weapon again.\nThis time, I used a smaller amount of powder and loaded the ammunition. With just a bit on the fuse, I triggered the mechanism and felt the weapon's kick—stronger than usual.\nThe difference in smoke was immediate—only a small amount of gas, barely visible.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

An army of blacksmiths was already turning over massive quantities of ore we had been stockpiling for the past three months, ever since we halted all iron production. Now, the furnace devoured tons of it like a starving beast.\nA thick column of smoke rose into the sky as the furnace roared. The temperature kept climbing steadily, and I had barely slept the night before—too excited ever since they confirmed everything was ready. I just wanted to see it work.\nWhen the sluice opened and molten steel began pouring out, I felt like a dozen paths opened before me: weapons, tools, armor, construction materials... everything was now within reach. The steel quickly filled the molds, each shaped into one-kilogram ingots. Once they hardened enough to be handled with tongs, the blacksmiths carried them straight to the forges to be turned into axe heads. Tool production had begun—but this time, with forged steel.\nThe obvious problem now was the supply of iron. I only had a few dozen miners, and with half a ton extracted daily, it wouldn't be enough to keep the furnace running non-stop. Expanding mining infrastructure would be a top priority… but not today.\n\"All ready, my lord,\" said one of my men-at-arms, bringing me my saddled horse.\n\"Good. This trip to Altdorf must be swift and uneventful,\" I replied as I mounted.\nAs much as I wanted to stay, I had to appear in court. It was the only way to ensure the margrave's threat was ended once and for all. Only then could I concentrate my resources on infrastructure and defense, without the shadow of a legal claim hanging over my lands.\nLeaving the industrial zone behind, I joined Rutger's trade caravan. This time, the merchant brought a solid shipment: ten kilograms of blue pigment, over five hundred of soap, and a large amount of paper carefully stored in wooden crates. Since we started mass production, the number of workers in the workshop had increased from five to twenty, and they weren't allowed to rest. They had processed all available linen cellulose into high-quality sheets—perfect for accounting.\n\"Rutger… do you know anyone who sells leather? It might be a good idea to sell the books with covers already bound. We could make much more than just selling loose paper,\" I said, examining the contents of the crates.\n\"Stirland. They deal a lot in livestock. I'd recommend goats. Their hides are used to make the finest books sold in Altdorf,\" Rutger answered after thinking for a moment.\n\"Stirland, huh?... Could work. Still have contact with that noble? I could buy many more heads of livestock for my ranching operations,\" I added with a smirk.\nI spurred my horse, and we finally set out for Altdorf. The trip was slower than I would've liked. We had to match the pace of Rutger's caravan, which had grown larger after he couldn't resist buying more merchandise from Marienburg merchants and engaging in his eternal game of \"who swindles the other better.\" The result: a bulkier, slower caravan… and according to him, far more profitable.\nEven so, we arrived within the usual two to three days it took to travel from Reinsfeld to Altdorf. We stopped only in a few small villages, as we took the most direct—and most dangerous—route. I couldn't afford to cross the margrave's territory, which was faster and better maintained, but completely unsafe for me. I'd rather face beastmen than walk into a legal or military ambush.\nAccompanied by a strong escort, the few beastmen we encountered posed no real threat. As soon as they emerged from the woods to attack, they were cut down without mercy. Many of the men with me were seasoned hunters of those abominations; they knew exactly how and where to strike.\nAs we neared the great city, Altdorf loomed before us like a giant. From afar, the towers of the Imperial Palace and the majestic dome of the Cathedral of Sigmar were clearly visible. Imposing, eternal—they reminded all who saw them that this was the capital of the Empire: the beating heart of politics, faith, and power.\nHere is where I parted ways with Rutger. He preferred to enter through the southern gate, more suited for merchant caravans, while I took the west gate, located almost right next to the Hall of Justice.\nI didn't have to wait long. As soon as the guards saw the sigil my men bore, they let us through without much questioning, bypassing the long line of peasants, merchants, and artisans waiting to pay their taxes to enter the city.\nOnce inside, I rode quickly toward the court. I decided to present myself immediately at the Palace of Justice, where the legal battle would take place—one that, if the gods were fair, would finally put an end to the margrave's claim over my lands. I trusted that my army of lawyers, scribes, and legal investigators would corner him once the trial began… or so I hoped.\nAs I approached the palace, I noticed a small square nearby where several execution posts stood. Lifeless bodies hung from them, their legs swaying gently in the morning breeze. At their feet, wooden plaques nailed to the ground listed their crimes: breaking the windows of a noble estate, disturbing the public order, spilling beer on a noble lady's silk, murder, stealing bread...\n\"Stealing a loaf of bread… Damn, these judges love the death penalty for just about anything,\" I muttered, arms crossed, analyzing the scene.\nI paused for a moment—not out of pity, but to better understand how justice worked in this city. If a peasant could be hanged for stealing food, that said a lot about the court I was about to face. No mercy. No leniency.\nThe guards stopped me until my identity could be confirmed, then allowed me to pass into the tribunal, where I observed the building adorned with elegant decor and countless images of the goddess Verena.\n\"Nice way to use a goddess's image just so those who serve her can stuff their pockets with bribes,\" I muttered under my breath.\nAs I looked around the elegantly decorated building, filled with Verena's likeness, I began to hear shouting—voices I recognized.\n\"What do you mean there's a high chance we'll lose? I'm paying you for a reason! I can't lose to him,\" said the margrave's voice, clearly irritated. He was surrounded by a group of Altdorf lawyers, men dressed impeccably, though visibly intimidated by his presence.\n\"My lord... please, try to understand. These are complex proceedings. A large portion of the opposing counsel has been combing through Imperial archives dating back over two hundred years, looking for any kind of applicable precedent. Furthermore, it is well known that the judges involved... have accepted generous gifts,\" one of the lawyers said, trying to calm the margrave's growing fury.\n\"Of course they've accepted them! I've also given them generous gifts,\" growled the margrave, visibly tense.\n\"Yes, but... among us, it's an open secret that the judges have been living quite well thanks to the lavish bribes given to them by the baron. Magistrate Konrad Tessenhoff, for example, has doubled the number of parties at his mansion. He's spending the gold he's received over the past three months with both hands. And apparently, the other magistrates aren't in a different situation. All signs indicate their political careers are being very carefully funded... through this conflict,\" the lawyer explained, choosing his words with cautious precision.\nI watched as the margrave clenched his fists in restrained fury. His jaw twitched sharply, his teeth grinding. He was on the verge of exploding.\n\"Well, well… if it isn't my dear former tutor, the protector of Helmgart. How have you been? So many moons without the pleasure of your company,\" I said with a wide smile, spreading my arms as I walked forward, followed by some of my men.\n\"Albrecht… ungrateful dog,\" the margrave spat at the sight of me.\n\"Oh… I wasn't expecting such a chilly reception. I thought we were closer than that. After all, you were the one who so diligently oversaw my education during the years you were in charge of my upbringing,\" I replied with a tone that walked the line between forced courtesy and veiled sarcasm.\n\"If your father could see you now…\" muttered the margrave, but I cut him off.\n\"He would be very proud of what I'm doing. Especially when I can face off in court, peer to peer, against a high noble of Reikland… By the way, how's my good friend Joachim?\" I asked, interrupting him with a grin.\n\"That's none of your concern. Throwing it all away? Your post in the Reiksguard, your demigryph, and the honor of being knighted by the Emperor himself? All that, for what? To play at being governor?\" he said, still trying to make me feel guilty.\n\"That's exactly what I want. I'd much rather steer my own destiny than leave it in someone else's hands. Besides, everything you mentioned—I can achieve it by other means. Not long ago, I killed a wargor and cleansed a site defiled by beastmen rituals. The Cult of Sigmar was quite pleased with the result… and once this is over, I'll keep purging my forests until not a single trace of their corruption remains,\" I replied with a calm smile.\nThe margrave readied another verbal strike, but the doors to the chamber opened before he could speak. Several nobles and lawyers emerged, some with triumphant expressions, others clearly defeated.\nThe hall emptied quickly. One of the court magistrates approached us, wearing a neutral expression.\n\"Hmm… Ah, yes. The case of Mackensen vs. Reinsfeld,\" the magistrate murmured, observing us for a few seconds. \"Do Your Lordships have availability for a hearing tomorrow? We've been waiting months for this case to reach us, and it would be wise to begin reviewing the evidence—although your lawyers and legal scholars baron have already consulted me with a great many documents. The legal groundwork is solid.\"\n\"Fine by me,\" I said as I stepped forward, slipping a hand into the pocket of my overcoat and discreetly letting something fall to the floor. I bent down to pick it up, theatrically opening it in front of him. \"Oh, Magistrate… I believe you dropped this.\"\nThe box I held was crimson velvet with golden filigree. I opened it right before his eyes.\n\"Well now… incredible, isn't it? Is that not an amethyst necklace with gold, ruby inlays, and matching emerald earrings? I think I saw one like it at a jeweler's for nearly two thousand crowns. Magistrate… your wife must be a very lucky woman to have such a thoughtful husband.\"\nThe magistrate smiled and took the box naturally.\n\"Oh, how clumsy of me. Thank you kindly, Baron. And if you wish to see just how lucky my wife is, you are most cordially invited to the party I'll be hosting in the coming days. There'll be plenty to celebrate,\" he said with a sharp smile.\nI slowly turned my head toward the margrave. His face boiled with contained rage. His lawyers were pale, too scared to speak.\n\"Very well. If there are no objections, I'll begin reviewing the evidence tomorrow,\" announced the magistrate before turning and leaving the Hall of Retribution, flanked by two guards in Imperial livery.\nWe were left alone in the hall once more. Silence fell like a stone slab. Only the margrave's heavy breathing could be heard; he refused to look at me or respond. I kept smiling nonetheless.\n\"This doesn't have to end like this, Margrave. There's no need for someone to win or lose,\" I said calmly, my voice full of intention.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nThe margrave continued breathing heavily, tense, eyes fixed on the floor. One of his lawyers—pale as death, trembling—dared to speak for him.\n\"What… what do you propose, Baron?\" he murmured, as if afraid the margrave might glare him to death.\n\"I still say all this was a misunderstanding. That a rebellious knight, misinterpreting the margrave's goodwill toward me—now that I am recognized as an adult by both the Cult of Sigmar and Shallya—acted on his own. He attempted to take my lands by force, without the margrave's knowledge. A simple miscommunication… Isn't that right, Margrave?\" I asked, looking him straight in the eyes.\nThe tension was thick enough to cut with a blade.\n\"There's no need for anyone to be humiliated. We only need to tell the magistrate that after today's discussion, we've resolved the conflict and see no need to waste more of Verena's servants' time. The rebellious knight will be executed for high treason, his men—deceived by him—will be released, and you and I will go back to being good neighbors… just like in my father's day.\"\nI slowly extended my hand.\nThe lawyer looked at the margrave, who remained motionless. His fingers trembled beside his tunic.\n\"Given the circumstances… it's the best outcome we can hope for,\" he said softly, like each word was a struggle.\nThe margrave grimaced, pursed his lips. \"Fine,\" he muttered, turning to leave.\n\"Margrave? You're going to leave me hanging?\" I called out loudly, still holding my hand out.\n\"Does it matter?\" he snapped, not stopping.\n\"I consider this a gesture of good faith between parties, so I must insist,\" I added, keeping my hand extended.\n\"Forget it. That's not going to happen,\" he said coldly.\n\"Then I'm afraid there's no deal between us. The only way this ends is with a handshake,\" I said, eyes locked on him.\nThe margrave's lawyer pleaded silently, with clumsy gestures and cold sweat already soaking his brow.\n\"You'll escalate all this over a damn handshake?\" the margrave growled, grinding his teeth.\n\"You really want to be humiliated in court tomorrow just because you refuse to shake my hand?\" I replied calmly.\nThe margrave's jaw tightened. His eyes fixed on me for a moment, as if they meant to pierce me through, then without another word, he turned around.\nHe approached, extended his hand abruptly, and gave me a firm grip. I returned it with all the strength my arm could muster, smiling.\n\"This was all a misunderstanding,\" i said , looking at his lawyer. \"Inform the magistrate there'll be no need for a hearing. The matter has been resolved. I'll cover any legal costs.\"\nI let go of his hand slowly, smile still intact.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

However, he maintained the prohibition against the margrave using the state regiments stationed in Helmgart for personal campaigns that did not directly benefit the Empire.\nI had won completely. I was now free of the margrave's pressure. I no longer had to spend more than half my income on bribes and could finally reinvest everything back into my lands. At last, I would stop funding the lavish lifestyles of corrupt magistrates and sinful nobles.\nBut now that I was in Altdorf, I needed to make the most of my time here while keeping a low profile. I couldn't risk attracting the attention of a high-ranking priest of Sigmar who might be able to see through the magical items concealing my magical affinity.\nWeapons were tightly controlled in Reikland—at least when it came to their manufacture. Many nobles feared that a peasant armed with a pistol might kill a lifelong-trained knight with a single well-placed shot. The fear of losing the monopoly on violence echoed through the upper echelons like a constant whisper.\nIf I were in Ostermark or Ostland, it wouldn't be a problem. There, control fell directly to the Elector Count, and none of them minded their peasants being better armed to face all the horrors the eastern provinces endure each winter.\nThat's why I needed a permit from the Imperial Army's high command to begin arms production. I doubted I could steal a major contract from the gunsmiths of Nuln or the workshops of other cities in the Empire's industrial belt... but with the right connections and a proper presentation, I could get a foot in the door.\nThe problem was contacts. All I had were corrupt nobles who charged me for introducing me to a guy who knew another guy who knew someone else who supposedly knew the person I actually needed. And they charged me at every step. So I tried my luck in a place where I knew my father had left some influence behind.\nI went to a tavern near the Imperial barracks. The air smelled of beer. It didn't take long for me to spot the Carroburg Greatswords drinking, still in full gear. They were laughing, slamming tables, celebrating something. Probably a recent campaign.\nMy father had maintained good relations with many officers, especially with the Greatswords, as he had served in the regiment for many years before becoming baron of the lands I inherited. I approached the man whose armor bore the most adornments—likely a captain—just as he raised his mug.\n\"Excuse me, captain,\" I said firmly, catching his attention.\nThe man looked at me. At first, he didn't react, but as he focused on my face, he spat out what he was drinking.\n\"By Sigmar...!\" he exclaimed, coughing and wiping his mouth on his sleeve. \"You're the spitting image...\"\nCough, cough \"Damn... Are you the son of...? Yes, you're wearing his heraldry! You must be.\"\nI nodded silently.\n\"You knew my father?\" I asked bluntly.\n\"By blessed Sigmar, of course I did! I'll never forget the strongest, angriest, most bad-tempered bastard who ever served in this regiment. I still remember when he killed four beastmen with just two swings of his greatsword,\" he said with a nostalgic smile.\n\"I'd heard something about that... That my father was a distinguished member of such an honorable regiment in his youth,\" I replied with the proper formality.\n\"What can I help you with... I assume you're not just here for pleasantries,\" said the captain, tilting his head.\n\"Ah, straight to the point, I see. Yes, I need help. I wanted to ask if you have any connections to an Imperial general or their direct aides. I need permits to start arms production, and I don't want to break the law by doing it without proper authorization,\" I said, keeping a serious tone.\nThe captain eyed me for a moment, then took a long drink from his mug.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\n\"Arms production, eh? That's no small thing. There are some very jealous eyes watching who forges steel in Reikland... especially if you're not from Nuln's workshops or one of the traditional houses,\" he said, slamming his mug down on the table.\n\"I know. I just want a contact. Someone who'll give me a chance to present what I'm making. Nothing more,\" I said confidently.\nThe captain chuckled briefly.\n\"You talk like your father... and sound just like him when he asked to be the first to breach the green skins lines. Alright. I know someone. General Magnus Von Abresicht's aide might be able to help you with that permit,\" the captain said before downing his drink in one go. He burped loudly. \"You've got the coin, right?\"\nWithout saying a word, I tossed a bag of gold coins onto the table. It had been meant for legal bribes, but now it had a new purpose.\n\"Well now... this is heavy,\" the captain murmured as he opened it. His eyes widened. \"This is more than I make in a year.\"\n\"Probably much more, actually,\" I replied indifferently.\n\"Alright. Let's go.\" The captain left a few coins on the table for his companions, who laughed and sent him off with cheers.\nI followed him as we walked toward the buildings near the Imperial Palace. As we got closer, the number of Sigmarite priests noticeably increased, and with them, my discomfort.\n\"What's wrong, young Reinsfeld? The priests of Sigmar won't harm you,\" said the captain, noticing my tension.\n\"Have you ever been caught in one of their sermons?\" I replied without looking. \"You kill a few beastmen, and suddenly you're forced to sit through hours of speeches about being a paragon of virtue, devotion to Sigmar, and how you should keep hunting the Empire's enemies until your dying breath.\"\nThe captain burst into laughter.\nWe finally turned south, heading toward the barracks where the number of clergymen began to decrease, relieving the pressure of having to keep my magical items hidden. We crossed the courtyard and entered a building that clearly belonged to a state regiment. The captain led me without stopping.\n\"That one there, the one with the monocle,\" he said, pointing to a man with a refined demeanor, dressed in expensive clothes, quill in hand and an open book in front of him.\n\"The one with the monocle… really? That's how you introduce me?\" replied the man with a dry voice and an annoyed tone.\n\"Would you prefer I bring up what happened in—?\" the captain began, but the abrupt sound of the book slamming shut cut him off.\n\"That won't be necessary, captain. That information is not to leave this room. I won't warn you again, or I'll take disciplinary action,\" replied the man as he stood.\n\"He pissed himself when he saw a beastman,\" the captain whispered to me\n\"Argh! You muscle-headed brutes…\" the assistant muttered, shaking his head. \"I see your companion is a noble. May I ask what brings you here, young man of the Empire? I'm afraid we're not accepting recruits at the moment.\"\n\"No, actually, I've come to request something very specific. I'd like to ask for your assistance in securing an audience with General Magnus Von Abresicht,\" I replied with formality, giving a slight bow.\n\"And may I ask why?\" he said as he slowly walked around the desk, letting his boots echo deliberately across the stone floor.\n\"Ah, very simple. I've recently begun building a sizable industrial network, and I would like to obtain the proper permit to produce firearms—especially considering how delicate their regulation is,\" I answered honestly.\n\"A greater supply of weapons means more agile provisioning, yes, but one must also be cautious about who ends up wielding them. We wouldn't want peasants forgetting their place just because they've got a pistol in their hands,\" the general's assistant said, flipping through a book with a neutral expression. \"But… I don't believe that justifies an urgent meeting with the general. I could schedule one for you in two months... unless you have more convincing reasons.\"\n\"And exactly how many reasons would you consider enough to do me that favor?\" I asked as my hand was already sliding into my coat, reaching for one of the gold pouches.\n\"Two hundred should be sufficient,\" he replied without hesitation.\n\"Then here are my extra reasons,\" I said, dropping the pouch onto his desk. The metallic clink was deliberate, heavy.\n\"Right this way, please. The general is in his office,\" he said with a barely concealed smile.\n'Much cheaper than the other route… now let's see how much the general will charge,' I thought as I followed.\nWe walked through the building's corridors, passing by offices, archives, and supply rooms, until we reached the end of a hallway where a heavy oak door stood. The assistant stepped ahead, knocked firmly, and entered briefly. He had me wait a few moments. After a couple of minutes, he came out and gestured for me to enter.\nAs soon as I stepped inside, the general looked up from his desk with a faintly annoyed expression. He wore his uniform with martial sobriety—no unnecessary decorations.\n\"Who are you?\" he asked immediately, without courtesy.\n\"Albrech von Reinsfeld, honorable general,\" I replied respectfully, giving a slight nod.\n\"Reinsfeld… Reinsfeld… that's to the west, isn't it? Your father was a hunter of some repute, if I recall correctly.\"\n\"That's correct, general,\" I nodded, maintaining composure.\n\"My assistant says you want my support to obtain firearm production permits…\" he said, leafing through some documents. \"But I checked the state army records, and your lands are only obligated to supply forty men in the event of mobilization. So frankly, I wonder if I'm wasting my time.\"\n\"Those numbers are outdated, general,\" I said firmly but without insolence. \"The next Imperial census will make it clearer: at the beginning of the year, around fifteen thousand people lived in my domain. Today, we've already surpassed thirty-five thousand, and the number continues to grow. According to state calculations, that would mean my military obligation should be around one hundred and forty men. And that number could still rise—I'm planning another expansion in the coming months.\"\nThe general's eyes lifted from the document. For the first time, he showed genuine interest.\n\"Thirty-five thousand people… in Reinsfeld?\" he repeated, crossing his arms. \"Interesting, interesting… Tell me what you plan to produce, so I know what I can do,\" said the general with a serious face, though his voice revealed curiosity.\n\"A bit of everything. We recently brought a blast furnace online, so we have steel to work with. We also have a large group of smiths ready for action. We plan to produce swords, spears, chainmail, greaves… and firearms, of course, along with the corresponding gunpowder,\" I finally replied, keeping my voice steady and composed.\n\"Interesting… don't you think?\" the general said, glancing at his assistant, who nodded silently.\n\"Very well. I can intercede on your behalf. Consider it a favor,\" he finally said, with a faint smile.\n'Ugh… I don't like that kind of favor.'\n\"No need for that, general. I'm more than willing to compensate you for the trouble,\" I said, forcing a false smile while my fingers reached into the coat.\n\"Nonsense, von Reinsfeld! I won't take gold from the son of such a renowned beast hunter,\" the general replied, returning the smile with one equally insincere.\n'As much as I dislike it, this route is safer than dealing with judges… or worse, getting too close to the clergy of Verena and Sigmar.'\n\"Very well, then I count on your support, general. Once I have the permits, I'll hire gunsmiths here in Altdorf, take them back to Reinsfeld, and begin production as soon as possible.\"\nThe general nodded slowly. \"Perfect. My assistant will draft the preliminary authorization and seal it with my signature. That will allow you to start the paperwork, and if all goes well, you'll have the final documents in less than two weeks.\"\nHe turned to his assistant. \"Have everything ready by the end of the day.\"\n\"Yes, general,\" his assistant replied.\nI gave a slight bow, observing protocol, and quickly left\nheading toward the Imperial Engineers School\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The general's been acting strange lately… He's spending more time with books and nobles than with us, training or clearing the forests. Though, to be honest, it saves us entire weeks of patrolling those damned regions,\" the captain said, placing a hand on my shoulder.\n\"Here… I wish I could give you more for your help, but you know how it is—someone else took his cut, and I don't have much gold left. This was just pocket money,\" I said, handing him the last few gold coins I had. I'd need to find more soon.\n\"That's one way you lot are different,\" he said, laughing. \"Your father was nearly impossible to convince to pay extra…\"\n\"In that, we're exactly the same, believe me. The only difference is that my financial situation is very different from my father's,\" I replied in a dry tone. \"Speaking of which… I know it's illegal to hire men from the state regiments, but once they retire, or if they're wounded, or some of your subordinates… they're always welcome to seek work in my lands. I'm interested in having hardened veterans in my ranks—especially as instructors, since I'm reforming and expanding my forces.\"\n\"I know a couple of old grumps retiring this year, if all goes well,\" said the captain, placing his hands on his hips. \"I can tell them that their former captain's son is waiting for them with open arms. More than a few would be glad to leave if you offer them something stable.\"\n\"Any veteran you know—if they're retiring—tell them exactly that. If useful men show up on my lands to bolster my personal forces… I promise your pockets will be full for each one you send,\" I said, pointing to the coin pouch I had just given him.\n\"I'll keep that in mind,\" the captain replied with a slight smile.\n\"It's been a pleasure. If you'll excuse me, I'll be off. I want to see if I can find an engineer willing to work for me.\"\nThe captain nodded as he began to check the pouch's contents.\nI left the military district and made my way toward where my retinue was stationed within the city. They were preparing to unload the baggage at a nearby tavern. Though, if I was lucky, I would leave this city today—avoiding one of those decadent parties the corrupt nobility of Altdorf enjoys so much.\nThe sooner I leave this place, the better.\nFollowed by my guards, it didn't take long to reach my destination. I had made a quick stop at my properties within the city to refill my gold pouches—essential, if one wants to move efficiently through Imperial politics. Here, gold is the best calling card one can offer.\nThe sound of loud explosions told me I was close. Not battle—tests. The rumble of gunpowder and heavy machinery guided me to the building where the Altdorf Engineer's School had its main headquarters, located in the most erudite quarter in the southern part of the city.\nAlthough I could attempt to improve a musket myself by shamelessly copying the Dwarfen design I possess, with so much work on my shoulders, delegation was the wiser choice. I only needed to state what I wanted—someone else could build it for me.\nAs I reached the front of the grand building, I noticed there weren't many visible guards. Only a few members of the local watch stood at the entrances in a passive stance, more symbolic than genuinely protective. I crossed the doors without issue and soon found myself before a receptionist who looked up from the open books on his desk.\nHe examined me carefully. I saw his eyes settle on me, then my escorts, then back to me again—this time with a measured smile, the kind one usually sees in merchants.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, young noble. Have you come with the intent of enrolling in our noble institution?\" he asked with a sharp, businesslike smile.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar,\" I replied, giving the sign of the twin-tailed comet. \"As much as I'd like to, that's not why I'm here… I've come with the intention of becoming a patron of this institution. I wish to make a generous donation to support the technological advancements that help defend our borders from the Chaos in the north and the greenskins in the south,\" I responded in a refined tone, employing all the soft skills I had learned at the Margrave's banquets.\nThe receptionist's pupils dilated—clearly, he'd just heard something he liked.\n\"Oh, of course. We are always open to Imperial elites supporting technological progress,\" said the receptionist, intertwining his fingers with practiced professionalism. \"Do you already have something specific in mind for your donation? Or would you prefer that our institution determine where best to allocate the funds?\"\n\"I'm a frontier noble, as you can imagine. I don't have the knowledge to properly judge the work done here. But if you'd be kind enough to show me the facilities, I could quickly discover which area I find most interesting to support,\" I replied with a polite smile, maintaining eye contact.\n\"Of course… allow me to fetch someone who can show you around the facilities,\" he responded courteously before turning and disappearing through a side door.\nMoments later, he returned accompanied by a man who was clearly a professor. He was well-dressed, though his brow was furrowed and his face full of irritation, as if he had been pulled away from something important.\n\"Here you are, young noble. This professor will show you our facilities,\" said the receptionist, gesturing toward the academic, who was already eyeing me with clear impatience.\nWithout saying a word, the professor gave a curt hand gesture for me to follow him—and I promptly did.\nHe began talking as we walked down the corridors. He mentioned how the institution had been founded by Leonardo da Miragliano and the then-Prince of Reikland. He went on with a disquisition about the need for research to protect the Empire, and how their alchemists were managing to produce increasingly pure black powder.\n'If only they knew their black powder is outdated…' I thought, smirking while feigning attentive interest. Still, it was useful to see how they worked.\nHe took me to the classrooms, where some professors were explaining concepts related to firearm production. They spoke, for instance, about repeating mechanisms. Although interesting, the models they showed were so heavy that they could hardly be held with one hand.\nLater, I was taken to the laboratory. That was the first time I felt genuine envy. They had a decent lab—at least by current standards. It was clearly designed to allow dozens of students and academics to work simultaneously. All seemed focused on black powder production and on finding ways to stabilize its volatility, using all sorts of materials and theories to prevent a mere spark from causing a detonation.\n'They're not working with the dangerous acids I experiment with, but if they keep this up, they might match my current level in a couple of centuries,' I thought as I watched closely.\nAfter that, I was led to a classroom specialized in weapon design. A professor was enthusiastically explaining the mechanical principles required to withstand the pressure generated by black powder combustion, and how to craft components capable of enduring such tension without bursting.\nThey also showed me other classrooms where topics like metallurgy, ballistics, and mechanism construction were taught. Finally, we reached the center's library, filled with technical treatises on weapon manufacturing and powder formulas.\nThe last stop was the source of the explosions I had heard at the entrance: the shooting range.\nThere I was greeted by a chaotic yet fascinating scene. Dozens of students were testing their creations—from simple handguns to arquebuses of various designs, and even what looked like a musket… though its barrel was so long I doubted it could be practically reloaded in real combat.\nEach shot was followed by the attentive eyes of professors who measured penetration, spread, and range, comparing results on wooden boards or practice armor placed at different distances. Some students celebrated with joy, others frowned and took notes after each failure.\n\"So this concludes our tour, young noble. May I ask in which area you plan to make your donation?\" the professor asked, now with a much more interested tone.\n\"I was considering a donation of about five thousand crowns, mainly for the design department. I believe that would be the most useful area for students to have more materials to work with… and take the risk of making mistakes,\" I replied without much emphasis, as if it were a minor gesture.\n\"That would be a great help,\" said the professor, his eyes lighting up. \"We could stock our warehouses for several months.\"\n\"I was also thinking about sponsoring a few students. Of course, I mean those who don't already have support from a Elector Count or another important noble. I don't need prodigies, but I would certainly like someone to carry my name as patron,\" I added with a relaxed smile.\n\"Certainly… I can bring some of my best design students, if you'd like,\" the professor replied, nodding enthusiastically.\n\"Of course. I'll wait here,\" I said as I watched a new round of shooting practice.\nI saw one of the teams preparing a cannon—smaller than field artillery but still deadly. They carefully loaded it and aimed at a practice dummy reinforced with iron plates.\nThe blast was impressive. The impact shattered the dummy into a thousand pieces, earning applause and cheers from the crowd.\n\"If I had been taught classes like this in my youth, I'd have paid full attention,\" I muttered to myself, arms crossed, as the students laughed.\nFinally, after a decent—though entertaining—wait watching the firearms practice, the professor returned accompanied by about thirty students. They all looked quite nervous at the sight of me.\nI began with a few simple questions about their grades, but soon shifted the focus to their backgrounds. In the end, that was far more important to me than any mark on paper.\nChildren of noble families were useless to me: they would be hard to control, and when they decided to leave, I'd either have to let them go or, at worst, arrange for some unfortunate accident when they left my domain. Children of guild members were another problem. If any of them joined the Altdorf guild, they could pressure me and cause trouble for my production in the future. So, every time I heard someone belonged to either group, I simply left them talking to themselves.\nFinding a prodigious commoner without connections was almost impossible. The true geniuses were already sponsored by someone more powerful or influential than I. So I had to settle for those who, while not brilliant, at least weren't useless.\n\"And you?\" I asked, looking at a young man clutching a book tightly. He seemed so nervous he didn't know whether to speak or run.\n\"Come on, idiot, don't blow this chance… pardon, my lord. He's just bad at talking to new people,\" another student intervened, pushing the first one firmly on the shoulder.\nThe young man, without saying a word, handed me his book.\n\"The boy's mediocre,\" said the professor accompanying me. \"Terrible at alchemy, lazy in metallurgy… but he has a gift for design. That's why I brought him. I know he's exactly what you're looking for.\"\nI opened the book with some skepticism, but as I flipped through the first pages, my doubts vanished.\nThe designs were exactly what I needed: substantial improvements to the imperial arquebus. There were blueprints for a longer barrel, a proper stock to absorb recoil, and a wheel-lock mechanism for safer firing. He was clearly inspired by dwarven designs—the resemblance to my own dwarven arquebus was evident—though his model even included a longer barrel than mine.\nExactly what I was looking for.\n\"May I speak to him alone?\" I asked, closing the book and looking at the professor.\nHe nodded reluctantly and took the rest of the students back to their classrooms.\nOnly two were left in front of me.\n\"I said alone,\" I repeated, looking at the other student.\n\"He'd probably mess it up if I left him alone,\" the second one replied, arms crossed.\n\"Alright, let's get to the point. Do you two want your own workshop?\" I asked directly, watching their reactions. Only one answered.\n\"Of course, my lord! It's the dream of anyone here,\" the extroverted one said with enthusiasm. \"Right, Mathias?\" he added, nudging his friend. The other nodded silently.\n\"I'm offering this to both of you, because I can't allow others to know what I'm working on,\" I said, glancing around to ensure no one was nearby. \"I have imperial permission to produce weapons, and I need a designer to create a model usable by my personal forces. If you leave this institution now, I guarantee a workshop, materials, and a fixed salary of one gold crown per day. So you don't think I'm bluffing… here's an advance.\"\nI handed each of them a pouch with a hundred crowns. The clink of gold was enough to make the quiet one look up.\n\"So that patron thing was a lie?\" the extroverted one asked, confused but relieved.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on\n\"The donation will go to the university… someday. Only Sigmar knows when. But you have an opportunity now. I don't care if you're not graduates—I need your skills urgently. I provide the means: tools, materials, your own workspace. What do you say?\"\nThe extroverted one leaned toward the silent Mathias, who whispered something in his ear.\n\"He's asking if his family can come with him to your lands… well, and mine too,\" said the talkative one, turning back to me.\n\"Of course. I don't know if you've heard the imperial proclamation, but my lands accept settlers by decree of the Emperor. I'll provide a house for each of your families. What do you say now?\"\nThis time, both nodded without hesitation.\nAfter sealing the deal, I spoke again with the professor and told him that my generous donation would arrive around harvest season. The professor walked me to the exit with a satisfied smile, though I doubted he'd ever see a single coin. I already had what I wanted.\nI waited outside the building with my escorts until the two students emerged carrying several belongings., I also had to wait outside their homes. From the first, I heard angry shouting before the whole family came out carrying bundles. At the second, the shouts were celebratory, followed by laughter and embraces.\nWith everything tying me to the city resolved, I left Altdorf as fast as the horses would allow.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

A few days ago, my gunsmiths had started producing the new weapons. Most of what I wanted was already sketched out in Stefan's designs, so upon their arrival, I immediately handed over the houses I had prepared for their families in advance, and then placed thirty blacksmiths under the gunsmiths' direct orders.\nThus began the manufacture of the first muskets. With access to both steel and wood, they could produce most of the necessary parts without relying on external merchants. Even so, initial production was limited: barely one musket a day, recently increased to two.\nIt was a laughable number for an army, but understandable. The main cause was the inexperience of the blacksmiths — all of them still apprentices. They had to practice forging specific parts over and over, especially the barrels, which had to be stretched by hand and carefully fitted. I wanted the weapons to be as accurate as possible, and that meant sacrificing speed for quality.\nAs for me, after hanging the margrave's knight and leaving his corpse exposed in the city square for several days — as a warning — I finally handed it over to Morr's priests. I also released the men-at-arms who had been held captive for weeks; they were gaunt, but at least alive.\nAfter that episode, I focused all my attention on large-scale gunpowder production. I significantly reduced pigment manufacturing, as I no longer needed to spend a fortune bribing corrupt judges. My only priority was to maintain a strategic gunpowder reserve for future campaigns.\nI also recruited another hundred men. I trained them relentlessly in the use of muskets, constantly rotating them with their comrades so that everyone became familiar with the weapon. The difference between traditional black powder and smokeless powder was obvious — the training field was no longer cloaked in a dense white haze. Everything cleared quickly, allowing for faster, more effective rotation.\nThe goal of the training was to teach them to shoot quickly and accurately. We had begun using small paper cartridges with the exact amount of powder for each shot, which sped up the reloading process and reduced errors. Each passing day brought my men closer to the standard I demanded.\nFinally, the first steel armor pieces were also being produced — both plate segments and chainmail — for my troops' protection. This is when my army of blacksmiths truly began working in earnest. The quality still left much to be desired; most were apprentices, and this was the most demanding work they'd encountered in a long time. However, their numbers kept growing, as word spread through nearby villages that I was hiring blacksmiths — with or without experience. I already had over three hundred blacksmiths.\nWith that workforce, we also began clearing the forests across my domain. Though truthfully, there wasn't much left to do: we had already lured out and exterminated every beastman presence in the area. If there was a notable change, it was that the forests were now infested with bandits instead of Chaos creatures. A relative improvement — at least bandits were human, not worshippers of the Ruinous Powers.\nThe clearing of the woods and the consolidation of an active trade route turned my village into a budding city. Merchants who once traveled from Marienburg to the Empire, forced to pass through the deadly Drakwald Forest, now preferred my lands — though the threat of orcs remained. Traders from Schilderheim also began arriving by boat down the river, drawn by the growing population and relative safety of my domain.\nThe city was growing. Traffic was increasing. And though my peasants still earned less than those in Altdorf, they had work, food, and protection. That was more than many Imperial nobles offered.\nAnd now I intended to keep training my men, but I had run out of enemies to fight — save for a few disorganized bandit groups. Those incidents were better handled by patrols, not something worth mobilizing the whole army.\nI had in mind launching a campaign toward my smallest and most remote village: the mining settlement that, in theory, should have been the main destination for migrants. But so far, no one had moved there — at least not that I knew of. So I decided to act. Once I'd stockpiled a decent number of muskets, I gathered all my men from the training camp and we began marching north, aiming to clear the area for future expansion and, if possible, explore the Grey Mountains in search of greenskin camps.\nWe departed at dawn. My personal army marched equipped with the best gear we had. We followed a dirt road that connected to Reinsfeld. The trip took only a couple of hours before we began reaching the foothills of the Grey Mountains.\n\"How strange… the village is supposed to be here,\" I said, scanning the terrain for the mining settlement. But the dirt road had almost vanished beneath our feet.\n\"My lord, if I'm not mistaken, the village was relocated a few months ago due to the water quality dropping significantly when mining operations began,\" one of my men-at-arms explained, pointing west. \"Your late father ordered it moved closer to the border with the secessionists.\"\n\"Thanks for the information… although a little late,\" I replied dryly, staring at him. \"Now, how the hell are we going to ford the river without a bridge?\"\nI rode up to the river. The water was crystal clear — snowmelt, recently released by the sun's rays, practically free of impurities. We began to backtrack until we found a rudimentary crossing, a natural ford probably used by local wildlife.\n\"I want a watchtower here,\" I ordered. \"This spot is surely used by some merchants to avoid paying tolls.\"\nI left behind a small detachment of ten soldiers with a cart full of tools and construction materials. Their task was to begin building what I had requested.\nThe water was terribly cold, which was to be expected, given it came from melting snow. That's why I ordered everyone to cross riding on the carts, to avoid getting their feet wet. Otherwise, someone would end up with trench foot like an idiot for not drying off in time. The crossing took some time, but eventually, after we forded the river, we marched westward until we saw white smoke columns rising into the sky.\nThe road was nothing but packed mud from carts, barely a trace. When it rained, it would become pure sludge. It rains almost year-round in this area, so the state of the road didn't surprise me.\nWe were greeted by a group of peasants armed with tools. They calmed down immediately when they saw my crest and lowered their weapons to receive me.\n\"Is this really the village supplying us with iron? It's in terrible condition,\" I muttered.\n\"They've never missed a quota, my lord,\" replied one of my men. \"Always on time. Five carts full of ore each week, just as your father ordered. They've followed it to the letter.\"\n\"If I'm not mistaken, that river over there marks the border with the rebel province. Set up camp there. I'll meet with the mayor and see what can be done to prepare the area for the arrival of new settlers.\"\nI split from the group, followed closely by two men-at-arms. The rest of the army headed toward the river.\nIdentifying the mayor was easy. He was the only one wearing clearly purchased clothing, not handmade by peasants.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, mayor,\" I greeted with the comet gesture.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, my lord,\" he replied calmly. \"May I ask what brings you to honor us with your presence?\"\n\"I want to expand the productivity of these mines. New workers will soon settle in these lands, so I need a detailed report on the resources detected and the dangers you've faced.\"\n\"Well, my lord… the iron mine is the livelihood for most of us. Those who work in it keep a portion of the ore to sell to merchants and thus sustain their homes. We grow barley, though not on a large scale — only seven families farm. Raising chickens is more widespread,\" the mayor said as he looked around.\n\"And dangers?\" I asked again.\n\"Not many. Every now and then, a stray greenskin wanders through the area, but our rotating patrols know how to handle them.\"\n\"Rotating patrols?\" I asked with interest.\n\"We draw lots to decide who takes on guard duty. Since most of those who founded this village served under your grandfather, we know how to handle weapons. It's not hard to deal with one or two greenskins that got separated from their group,\" he explained confidently.\n\"Interesting. Any other mineral veins detected?\"\n\"Iron. A lot of iron. The entire mountain slope is rich with it. We focus on extracting large rocks from the summit. We found an old abandoned tin mine, but didn't enter. There were huge spiders, so we sealed it. No problems since.\"\n\"Thank you for the information. I'll make sure the area is scouted thoroughly to locate any nearby greenskin camps. I'll also consider what to do with that mine later. You may return to your duties.\"\nThe mayor nodded, and I began observing the village. It was deplorable, honestly — poorly built houses lacking any proper carpentry technique. But what worried me most were the roads; once they filled with mud, it had to be nearly impossible to move effectively.\nBuilding a proper road would be the top priority for now, alongside keeping a close watch on the greenskins roaming the area.\nFollowed by my guards, I continued toward the mountains. From the heights, I observed the mining camp: an open-pit mine. The ore was so abundant I could almost sense it without even actively using my arcane abilities.\nI ordered my guards to keep a close watch over the area and stepped away for a moment. I closed my eyes and let the Wind of Chamon flow through me, releasing the self-restraint I had maintained for so long. I allowed my senses to sharpen, searching clearly for the minerals buried in the mountain's depths — minerals that would one day fuel the expansion of my industry.\n\"Iron… a lot… an enormous amount of iron. Lead… to the east. Tin… to the south. That must be the mine the mayor mentioned. I can feel how the tin curves, like a void. Coal… though it's faint, I can barely sense it. And something else… silver? Maybe… I'm not sure, it's a hazy sensation,\" I murmured as I focused.\n\"This feeling… it reminds me of… dwarven runic armor. But… that would mean there was once a fortress here… a burial ground? Or a battlefield? I think the latter. I can feel axes… daggers… and scraps of poorly forged iron that move. A greenskin camp — found,\" I said as my arcane senses remained active.\n\"What is that…? I think it's a large dwarven fortress… but it's been taken by the greenskins. There are too many,\" I added, surprised.\nI took a deep breath. \"Luckily, I think they're on the Bretonnian side of the mountains,\" I said, calming myself as I regained control over the winds.Google seaʀᴄh ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nI opened my eyes and looked around, satisfied with what I had discovered.\n\"Well… looks like I'll be quite busy in the coming weeks, turning this village into a mining city capable of extracting everything I need,\" I said with a smile.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Dozens of trees covered the western area, preventing the farmers from expanding their farmland. The land was perfectly flat, but completely overgrown, and the townsfolk simply lacked the tools needed to remove them.\nIn the days I had been here, I had turned my personal army into a work crew. They had been clearing the land: felling trees, breaking up large rocks, uprooting brush, and most importantly, paving the road. For that, we used leftover bricks from the sewer construction and mortar we had stored. All my forces were assigned to these tasks.\nThough we had only been working a few days, we had already paved a good stretch. We first laid down a layer of coarse gravel as a base, and then placed bricks fixed with quicklime mortar. The paved section already stretched several kilometers.\nAll of this had a single goal: to give the newly arrived settlers a direct connection to Reinsfeld. If I could attract local merchants to the village, I could reduce the economic dependence this community had on my own coffers.\nSince it was just a small village, any problem fell directly on me to solve. But we were already working to ensure that, once the waves of new workers arrived, the next shipments could be transported without issues to the blast furnace, feeding the war industry.\nFor that reason, I was deeply interested in the tin mines. Tin was used to make bronze and had other useful applications, but beyond that, I suspected the tunnels were connected to a small dwarven stronghold. Reclaiming it could earn us favor with a clan.\nThe dwarves, with their rigid concept of property, never consider something truly lost—only momentarily out of reach. So if we could recover that stronghold, we might not gain gold or land, but something far more valuable: dwarven recognition. And with that, perhaps we could request a runic artifact, not with minor runes, but a greater rune forged by a true master.\nOnce I saw that the road construction was well underway, I took a hundred men and set off to inspect the mine. We climbed the mountainside and soon found the great hole the mayor had spoken of, blocked with rocks and dried mud. We began removing the makeshift plug the locals had placed.\nSince no one else in our group had magical affinity, I could fully unleash my arcane abilities without worrying about hiding them. I let the Wind of Chamon flow through me, sharpening my senses until I could almost see in the dark, feeling the resonance of the minerals surrounding us.\nMy men, meanwhile, had already lit their torches as we began to enter the mine.\nI felt the vibration of the minerals beneath our feet… but something else too. Something was moving in the depths.\n\"Pikes… something's coming,\" I said quietly. My men immediately brought their pikes forward and formed up. The musketeers took their weapons and readied themselves.\nWe advanced in tight formation, as fast as the terrain allowed, trying to explore as much as we could before whatever lived in that mine caught up with us.\nI felt a vibration to my left and instinctively drove my dagger into the spot. The blade pierced something hard, and when I pulled it out, I saw a spider the size of a small dog writhing, impaled.\n\"So these are the large spiders the mayor mentioned,\" I muttered as the creature died, still stuck to my dagger.\nThen I felt it. Multiple light, rapid steps coming toward us.\n\"Ready yourselves!\" I shouted, raising my voice.\nAnd they appeared.Follow current novels on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"Shit… they're huge!\" I exclaimed as the spiders poured out of the tunnel. Some were the size of wolves, others of bears. \"Shoot them!\" I ordered immediately.\nThe musketeers stepped forward and opened fire. The detonations echoed through the cave. Several of those monstrosities dropped, but the rest charged at us without hesitation.\nFortunately, our pikes gave us the advantage. As they tried to get close, they were impaled without fail. The largest ones thrashed and screamed but couldn't breach our lines.\n\"Watch your legs! Smaller ones are slipping through the rocks!\" I shouted, spotting spiders the size of dogs crawling beneath the stones.\nI stepped forward and impaled one with my sword. I crushed another under my boot, splattering its disgusting insides across the floor.\nOne of the large ones tried to bite me, but several pikes pierced it before it reached me. I thrust my sword under its head and split it open. Its thick black blood splashed over the stone.\nAnother volley of musket fire thundered in the gallery. Many more fell, especially the largest. Finally, the survivors began to flee, retreating into the depths.\nI took a deep breath and looked at my men.\n\"Was anyone bitten?\" I asked, scanning their tense faces. Many still clutched their weapons tightly, shaken by what could only be described as an experience straight out of damned Australia.\nEveryone shook their heads, staring at their feet. Without wasting time, we began finishing off the spiders that still twitched, stabbing whatever we had into their heads. I wasn't about to let those bastards recover and ambush us on the way out.\nI ordered a rotation of pikes, since several had broken during the creatures' charge. We resumed the descent into the mine, following the mineral vein, which was the safest route. I could feel everything moving around us, giving us an edge in these dark depths.\nWe kept cutting through spider silk. It was thick, incredibly strong, and often blocked our progress for several minutes. But we wouldn't waste anything useful: I ordered all the silk we cut to be kept. We'd study its properties later.\nWe were ambushed several more times as we descended, each attack more desperate than the last. The spiders came in waves. Though their numbers grew, their size diminished. Soon, they were so small they were no longer a threat—you could crush them just by stepping on them.\nThat's when the tunnel changed.\nThe structure became more refined. There were supports carved from the same mineral, and the passageways widened considerably. We could move more freely, but that came at a cost: we had lost one of our key advantages—the natural bottleneck where our pikes formed an impenetrable wall.\nWe proceeded with caution and soon found dwarven statues, though many were broken or toppled. Some barely retained identifiable details of their origin. It was clear that, centuries ago, this had been a dwarven stronghold.\nEventually, the tunnel opened into an enormous chamber...\nAnd it was filled with eggs.\nThousands.\nClusters upon clusters of spider eggs covered every surface. The walls, the floor, even the ceiling—everything was coated in those repulsive, pulsing whitish sacks.\nI came to a dead stop. My grip tightened around my sword.\n\"Give me the torch. I want to test something,\" I said, reaching toward one of my men who was nervously lighting our way. I took the torch and approached one of the closest eggs, which was covered in damp moss and thick silk.\nThe moment the flame touched it, the entire thing ignited.\nWithin seconds, the entire chamber turned into an inferno. The fire spread as if the cave had been soaked in oil, leaping from sack to sack as they grotesquely inflated and burst. The crackling flames mingled with the hiss of countless small bodies incinerating instantly. The reaction was brutal and swift, like I had triggered a trap that had slept for centuries.\nI laughed. For a moment.\n\"Ha... ha... ha... ah...\"\nMy laughter stopped abruptly when I saw something that made my blood run cold.\nAmid the sea of flames, a massive silhouette emerged. A monstrous spider, larger than anything I had ever faced, rose from within the burning eggs. Flames clung to its shell.\n\"Run!\" I shouted. \"Back the way we came! Run, you fools, if that thing catches us, we're dinner!\"\nI didn't wait to see if they obeyed. I turned instantly and began running uphill through the tunnel as the creature's steps made the very rock beneath us tremble.\nWe ran like madmen, slipping on loose stones and sticky webs, until we reached the main shaft we had originally descended. The creature chased us with blind fury, but we soon discovered its limit: the tunnel was too narrow for its massive body. We saw it halt abruptly, slamming against the entrance with a crash that made the stone vibrate. Its colossal form became stuck, its front legs clawing violently at the rock, trying to force its way through.\nWe stopped a few meters up, gasping and coughing from the smoke following us out of the burning chamber, covered in dust and spider silk.\nThe beast growled from the other side. We could see it struggling at the entrance, its fangs snapping in rage at being unable to reach us.\n\"Give this hungry little spider some lead,\" I said between breaths, raising my hand.\nMy men needed no further prompting. Two dozen muskets aligned in seconds. Everyone waited tensely until the beast stuck its head through the hole, trying to snap at the air.\nThe volley was deafening.\nA storm of powder, lead, and fire erupted at the creature. The tunnel lit up with muzzle flashes. A hellish screech burst from the spider's throat as it thrashed, tearing up stone, dirt, and wood around it.\nThe tunnel shook violently. The tremor was so strong that a small rain of debris fell from the ceiling.\nThen, I felt it—something collapsed with a dry, echoing thud that shook the ground beneath us. Through the thick smoke, I barely made out the creature's silhouette. The spider had fallen onto its back, legs curled inward in that universal death pose of all beasts. It was dead.\n\"Cough—cough—Let's get out of here until the smoke clears,\" I ordered, feeling the air grow thicker and the temperature rising quickly. The fire we had started was devouring everything in its path, and even though that chamber was far below us, the heat was already reaching us.\nWe kept moving without pause, this time ascending. Thankfully, the tunnel we had used to enter remained open and we encountered no further resistance. The return was exhausting, but clean.\nWhen we emerged from the mine, a column of black smoke rose from the hole as if we'd opened the gates of hell. It was still early, so we took the chance to reseal the entrance with rocks, just as the locals had done before.\nAfterward, we went down to the river. None of us were in any condition to return to the city like that. We were covered in thick black blood, sticky webs, dust, and crushed insect remains. I removed my breastplate and sat by the shore, washing myself with freezing water. It wasn't pleasant, but it was necessary. I shed the dead weight, scrubbed the grime from my clothes, and carefully cleaned my sword.\nAfter a light meal, we returned to the mine entrance. The smoke had stopped, and the air—while still warm—was no longer choking. Assuming that most of the larger spiders had died in the fire and smoke, I decided it was time to fully secure the area before descending again into the tunnels that led to the dwarven stronghold.\nBut we couldn't leave the rear unsecured.\nSo we spent the rest of the day clearing. Tunnel by tunnel, chamber by chamber, moving carefully. The large ones had likely died of asphyxiation when the web-filled tunnels caught fire. But the small ones were still active, and we had to stomp them, crush them against the walls, or skewer them when they leapt from some crevice.\nTomorrow, we will inspect the dwarven stronghold.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I looked at the massive spider, completely charred, along with the entire great chamber that had burned in flames the day before. Nothing remained but ashes. The fire had consumed everything.\nMy men nodded and began spreading out through the area, inspecting the surroundings where spiders had once swarmed. They found many scorched remains of smaller specimens—shattered bones and carapaces burned to dust.\n\"My lord!\" one of the soldiers shouted. \"These aren't spider remains,\" he said, pointing to a blackened pile among the ruins.\nI approached cautiously. The man held his musket high, aiming at any potential threat hidden among the debris.\n\"Dwarven remains...\" I muttered as I examined the bones. \"The bone structure is more compact… much denser than human. And look at these teeth—quite worn down. Though the fire may have affected part of the jaw, this dwarf was definitely food for the spiders… Who knows how long ago.\"\nWe found many more dwarven corpses scattered throughout the chamber. Some skeletons were intact, others dismembered or crushed. All of them were charred. It was evident that this hall had once been a key area of the fortress, and that many of its last defenders had died here.\nI ordered a detailed inspection of the chamber. I didn't sense any threats in the area at the moment—my affinity would've warned me—but it was still wise to act cautiously. Since we had cleared all the tunnels behind us, this section was ideal to establish a temporary camp.\nWith nearly all my men operating in the mines, having a secure fallback point would be crucial.\nWe quickly set up the tents. The second entrance to the chamber was walled off with rocks and reinforced wood, just in case. After several hours of work, we had a decent underground camp. Small, austere, but functional. From there, we could operate in the lower levels without exposing ourselves too much.\nOnce the position was secured, we turned our focus to the enormous black stone gates that sealed the main entrance to the fortress. With the help of several men, wedges, and iron bars, we finally forced them open after much effort.\nWhat appeared was a long tunnel, much wider than any other in the mines. To our surprise, it was well lit.\nCrystals embedded in the walls gave off a faint golden glow, constant and stable. Likely some dwarven rune... though I couldn't feel the usual runic sensation of proper dwarven craft.\n\"With this, the men won't have to carry torches all the time,\" I commented.\nI ordered the advance.\nAs we marched through the massive tunnel, I immediately felt an anomalous concentration: many metal tips, knives, spears, and arrows all gathered in a single spot. I stopped in my tracks. That amount of weaponry could only mean one thing.\nWe found the entrance moments later. The doors were large and heavy, but not sealed—just closed. I gave a hand signal and positioned all my musketeers at the front.\n\"Push!\" I ordered.\nThe doors creaked with a metallic groan as they opened. As soon as we cracked them open a few inches, the interior came into view. A large group of goblins was gathered around a big bonfire. They were cooking something in a filthy pot, shrieking, arguing, spitting at each other.\nThey saw us.\nThey froze like rabbits caught in a lantern beam.\n\"Fire!\" I shouted without hesitation.\nThe thunderous sound of several dozen muskets firing at once shook the underground chambers like a caged storm. A thick cloud of smoke rose immediately, accompanied by agonized screams.\nThe goblins' bodies fell in pieces. Some rolled on the ground clutching their guts or severed arms, others just collapsed, unmoving, with half their skulls blown off or their torsos pierced by deformed lead slugs.\nThere was no mercy.\nThe rest of my men surged forward like an unstoppable wave. The surviving goblins tried to resist, wielding rusted knives and bent spears, but the shock of the initial volley had left them stunned. They fought poorly, disorganized, and what remained of their line crashed against our tightly packed pike formation.\nWe skewered them like cattle.\nSome tried to retreat, but didn't get far—the second volley caught them in the back, shattering their legs, piercing their spines.\n\"Reload! More incoming!\" I shouted, seeing my men immediately begin the drill.\nPaper cartridges came out from their belts. Each soldier bit his open, poured the powder into the barrel, then the ball, and with trained precision began ramming the charge with the rod. In seconds, the barrels were aligned again, all aimed at the only door leading to the next chamber.\nA tide of goblins burst through the entrance like a wave of bodies crammed into a tunnel too narrow. They pushed each other, screaming, their eyes filled with fury or fear. But there was no time for them to form a line.\nA fresh volley thundered instantly. My musketeers fired in unison.\nThe goblin vanguard was obliterated.\nThe lead balls ripped through several ranks at once, killing dozens of creatures packed so tightly it was impossible to miss. Many dropped without even knowing what hit them, others screamed in agony, watching their guts spill across the floor.\n\"March! Push forward!\" I shouted without wasting a moment.\nThe pikemen responded precisely. The phalanx fully formed, flanks secured by the walls, pikes pointed forward. They began advancing, step by step, like a killing machine.\nThe goblins, armed with little more than bent knives and crude hunting spears, couldn't reach our ranks. Their weapons were too short, their arms too small. All they could do was scream and push from behind, forcing those in front to meet death head-on.\nOne by one, they were impaled.\nThe pikes pierced throats, torsos, and faces. Some goblins were stuck on the steel blades and lifted like rag dolls before falling to the ground. Others, wounded, collapsed at my men's feet.\nAnd that's where it ended.\nWithout stopping, my soldiers stepped over them. Skulls cracked, throats collapsed under the weight of boots and armor. The phalanx didn't stop for anything. It was a wall of flesh, steel, and willpower, slowly advancing over a mountain of crushed corpses.\nThe screams didn't stop. But they were no longer battle cries. They were cries of desperation.\nThe goblins were beginning to realize they weren't fighting armed peasants. They were facing an army trained to exterminate.\nThe goblins in the front tried to retreat, but it was useless.\nTheir own companions in the rear pushed them forward, forcing them to crash into our pikes. They screamed, they begged, but they had no choice—they were impaled one after another. The constant pressure from their backlines turned them into sacrificial meat, trapped between their comrades and a wall of steel.\nOur phalanx advanced without pause. Slow, steady, unstoppable.\nWe only stopped to let the musketeers move forward between the ranks. In seconds, they formed a line at the front, took aim, and fired.\nThe muzzle flashes lit up the corridor.\nThe thunder of the shots bounced off the stone walls, and chaos overtook the goblin lines. Some tried to climb the walls to escape; others slipped in the blood of their own. That's when the order rang out again:\n\"Advance!\"\nAnd the phalanx moved forward once more, pushing with shields and pikes like a hammer that never stopped.\nThe tunnel became a slaughterhouse.\nGoblin blood soaked the walls. Thick pools gathered in the cracks of the floor, staining the stone a dark red. The screams grew weaker, drowned by the weight of bodies and the pounding of our boots.\nWe kept fighting until the dry, hollow sound of the last shot was heard. We had run out of gunpowder. Each man had spent the fifteen cartridges he carried. No more fire—only steel.\nI made the decision to fall back.\nDespite the massacre we were causing, it was foolish to continue without ammunition in a wide tunnel where our formation could break.\nThe goblins, seeing us retreat, regained some courage. They shouted, howled, throwing themselves harder, thinking we were falling back out of fear. But all they achieved was to impale themselves more easily. They hurled themselves like desperate beasts onto our pikes, pushed by those behind them who didn't understand what was happening up front.\nWe began to give ground in an orderly manner. When we reached the point where we had entered, I had the reserve companies form a second line. We left precise gaps to allow rotation and I gave the order: the frontline men were to fall back step by step, replaced by fresh troops.\n\"If we retreat now without order, they'll overwhelm us. This corridor is too wide and we don't have the numbers to form up here. Push them back!\" I shouted, pointing with my sword. \"Have the musketeers return to camp and bring more powder!\"\nAnd so they did.\nThe renewed vanguard advanced in unison, pushing with pikes at the greenskins who no longer knew whether they were attacking or being dragged to their deaths.\nThe tunnels had become rivers of blood. Goblin corpses piled on top of one another, turned into an unrecognizable mass of crushed flesh. Some were reduced to pulp under the weight of both armies. Others crawled without legs, only to be trampled by their own or pierced by our pikes without hesitation.\nFor what felt like an eternity, we toyed with them: we pulled back to lure them, then pushed forward again. We forced them to fight among the corpses of their dead, among broken bodies and thick puddles that soaked their ankles.\nFinally, after a long and exhausting battle, the goblins broke formation and fled in a panic, screaming like cornered rats. They left thousands of bodies behind, forming mountains of broken flesh along the corridor. Blood flowed between the stones like a thick stream.\nI watched the scene in silence and wiped the filthy goblin blood from my sword with a blackened rag. I had reaped many lives in those hours. I remembered them crawling on the ground, trying to dodge the pikes, only to be trampled or run through without mercy.\nI ordered my men to pile the bodies outside the fortress. I didn't want that rot obstructing our path when we returned. It was also a way to keep the area clean… at least, as clean as possible after such a massacre.\nWith the path clear and the men at the limit of their strength, we returned to the camp. No one spoke. Only the sound of tired footsteps, swords being sheathed, the scrape of dirty armor. I let them rest. They had earned it.\nI, however, didn't sleep.\nI spent most of what I assume was the day awake. It was hard to keep track of time without sunlight. Down here, everything was the same: darkness, humidity, and the distant echo of dripping stones. But the lack of a sky didn't stop me from feeling what moved through the stone.\nThousands of small metallic presences were still alive inside the goblin fortress. I felt knives, arrows, nails… all moving from one place to another as if they were part of a swarm. I tensed when a large concentration began moving in our direction, but it pulled back before reaching us. Just patrols, perhaps, or planned skirmishes they didn't dare carry out.\nEventually, I fell asleep.\nBut it wasn't normal rest.\nFor the first time, I allowed my winds of magic to remain active even while I slept. I didn't fully hide within my mind. I felt what happened around me: distant footsteps, bodies rising to urinate, to keep watch, to quietly eat something. I felt the metal of weapons, the weight of armor, the movements inside the fortress. It was like a lucid dream, but with every nerve on alert.\nMaybe it was the concentration of Chamon.\nWe were inside a mine—the ore, all of it amplified my affinity. I felt my arcane talent like never before.Follow current novᴇls on\nMaybe I'll try casting a spell tomorrow.\n-------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

A perfect live specimen to try out what I'd been developing with Hieronymus.\nI grabbed him by the neck and pinned him down, pressing my knee against his throat. The crack of his other arm breaking blended with a sharp, guttural shriek, like a pig at the slaughterhouse.\n\"Don't worry... it's only going to hurt... a lot,\" I murmured, reaching for his own dagger and bringing it close to his face.\nI began channeling the winds of Chamon through the metal, causing the atoms to vibrate with increasing speed. The internal friction began to heat the blade slowly, and the goblin's shrieks intensified as the blade turned red, then orange, then white-hot. The stench of burning flesh filled the air as the glowing metal grazed his face.\nThe goblin cried. Screamed. Twitched like a trapped animal, but I held him steady. Then I manipulated the metal—made it malleable, soft, flowing like molten clay—and with a small gesture, I slowly pushed it into his nostrils.\nHe convulsed violently, and the wet sound of metal burning flesh from the inside mixed with his broken breathing and shredded throat, raw from screaming.\n\"Ah... he's dead,\" I said in a flat tone, seeing his body go still. Only a bubbling goo leaked from his nose now, and a faint hum came from the metal still vibrating inside his scorched skull.\nI stood up, dusting off my knee. It had been a good test.\nHieronymus used to say my control of Chamon without incantation was impressive—unsettling, even. But the real issue was something else: I couldn't use Lingua Praestantia in front of my men. It would raise questions—not only about my methods but about my very nature. They had to think everything I did came from Sigmar's blessings. So I was forced to learn the hard way: in silence, without chants, without theatrical gestures or signs that might give me away.\nI had become skilled out of necessity. A wizard who couldn't appear as one.\nAnd with each passing day, it grew easier. When I truly focused, foreign metal responded as if it were an extension of my will. I could feel it in the air, in the ground, in every rusted beam and every nail forgotten on the floor. A thought was enough. A single intention. And the iron twisted, sharpened, shattered, or melted at my command.\nAn enemy's dagger could melt in his hand. A helmet could snap shut like a bear trap—though I could only do that to things I was physically touching.\nBut here, in the heart of the mine, I felt stronger than ever. Everything was easier. What once left me completely drained now required only a thought, a gesture. A simple hand movement was enough to make the winds obey.\nI felt ready.\nWhen my men began preparing for the next day of skirmishes, we were better equipped than ever. Each musketeer carried fifty prepared shots, and for every hundred soldiers, I assigned one supply carrier: I gave them saddlebags filled with potions bought from the Temple of Shallya, specifically made to neutralize common poisons. We'd been lucky so far that the goblins hadn't used poisoned arrows. Still, the threat was there—and I wasn't going to take chances.\nThe narrow terrain continued working in our favor—it forced the greenskins into close combat, where our pikes and tight formations tore them apart. But this time, I didn't settle for repeating the formula.\nMore weapons kept arriving. New muskets. Better powder. And best of all: Hieronymus had started producing on his own, manipulating the winds with a precision I still struggled to match. He no longer needed help. He was manufacturing gunpowder almost constantly while I remained on campaign. And everything he produced went straight into my arsenals.\n\"Come on… come on… today we continue the slaughter. Hard days lie ahead, but our duty as Sigmar's servants drives us to keep seeking battle against the horrors that threaten the Empire,\" I said, as my men lined up with discipline.\nOnce more, we opened the gates of the dwarven fortress and marched through the long central corridor. The echo of our boots rang out like war drums against the ancient stone.\n\"Stop! There are traps,\" I warned, raising my hand. I stepped closer and pointed to some taut strings, tied to a rudimentary mechanism made of wood with a rusted iron tip.\nI triggered the trap with the hilt of my sword. The wooden rod shot forward with a sharp snap.\n\"Watch out for this. Keep your eyes open. Greenskins are crafty. The tip's coated with what looks like poison, so unless you want to end up on the ground vomiting blood, watch where you step,\" I said in a dry voice.\nIt wasn't something I needed to worry too much about—I could sense every trap with metal inside. Iron and steel spoke to me, vibrated faintly, and I listened. Still, I disabled many manually, one after another. The ones made entirely of wood were the only ones that caught me off guard, but even those were simple. The same trap, repeated over and over. They only slowed us down.\nEventually, the corridor forked. I closed my eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. Using my link to Chamon, I felt the flow of metal ahead. If we kept going straight, we would reach a large chamber. It was nearly empty—only a few torsos covered in metal. Few. Harmless.\nI sent a detachment to clear them out. They found a few stray goblins blindly digging a tunnel. They died quickly, without resistance. Upon inspecting the area more carefully, we realized it was some kind of dwarven cemetery. There were tombs… all opened. I couldn't feel any metallic presence inside them or deeper down. Only raw ore from the surrounding rock.\n\"The tombs were already looted. Nothing left that could've been protected from the hands of the greenskins who attacked our friends in the mountains,\" I murmured, jotting the information into my campaign log. I stored the manuscript inside a reinforced leather satchel I carried with me.\nWe turned back and rejoined the rest of the troops. They were already positioned before another large gate of the fortress. When we opened it, a new tunnel was revealed. Long. Ancient. And I felt it immediately—goblin presence everywhere. This sector seemed to have multiple side chambers. All infested.\nWe advanced slowly, clearing room by room. Sweep, eliminate, move on. But soon, the first wounded began to appear. The small doors didn't allow our pikes to form ranks like in the main tunnel. The soldiers were forced to fight with swords and spears in tight quarters.\nAnd it became clear—my men were unbeatable in formation... but in one-on-one combat, they were just regular soldiers. Not duelists. Every wounded man meant triple the loss: one out of action, two more to carry and escort him back to camp. And almost all goblin weapons were poisoned. Surviving the cut wasn't enough—you had to race against time before the venom did its work.\nI ordered every injured man to be taken immediately back to camp to be treated with the few Shallyan potions we had left. There was no margin for error. Every delay cost a life.\nFor almost an hour we advanced, room by room. The greenskins had understood that facing us in the main hall was suicide, so they chose their ground: ambushes in cramped chambers, traps at the entries, attacks from the shadows. In that environment, where our pikes were useless and muskets too long, they had the advantage.\nThe corridors branched out again and again, like the rotting roots of an ancient tree. And we kept going, clearing every corner, but the list of wounded kept growing rapidly. And with it, came the first dead.\nI felt a weight in my chest when I saw the first of ours lifeless. A young boy. He didn't even have a beard yet. He died from a neck wound that turned gangrenous in minutes.\nI still didn't have the stomach to accept what it meant to be a commander. To watch my men die from orders I had given.\nI took a deep breath, closing my eyes for just a moment. While my men organized themselves to clear two rooms at once, I turned my attention to a nearby chamber still unexplored. I didn't wait for them to enter.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nI extended my hand and clenched it tightly, beginning to manipulate the winds of Chamon. I sensed the iron in the daggers, the spear tips, the crude goblin hilts. I unleashed friction between atoms, accelerated their vibration.\nAnd I heard it almost instantly.\nThe screeching began right away. The iron burned in their hands. Some tried to drop their weapons, but it was too late—they'd fused to their fingers. Others simply ran, bursting out of the chamber like rats on fire, hands covered in molten metal, screaming like slaughtered pigs.\nMy men looked at me in shock at what had just happened. They didn't understand why the goblins came running out of their hiding spots screaming like the damned, nor why so many had their faces or hands covered in molten iron. But they didn't ask. They accepted the miracle as the work of Sigmar.\nSince the trick had become easy for me, I kept repeating it in several rooms. I hid my hand movements behind my cloak or my soldiers' backs, so no one would realize I was responsible. No one could suspect what was really happening.\nAfter many skirmishes, wounds, and screams, we had three dead. Three. The number weighed on my chest like lead. But the section was almost clear. Thousands of goblins lay dead in the hallways, reduced to pools of blood and crushed meat.\nWe kept pushing forward until we reached a new section of the fortress: what seemed to be the main tower. It was separated from the rest, surrounded by an inner wall of black stone. And there, at the top, we saw goblins stationed on the walls, armed with bows and spears.\n\"Take cover!\" I shouted to my men, who pulled back into the nearest corridor. This was clearly a dwarven killing ground. If we stepped out into the open, the goblins would turn us into pincushions.\nThe musketeers cautiously moved ahead, looking for firing angles without exposing themselves. While they got into position, I joined the vanguard and, without making obvious gestures, began pointing at some of the goblins on the battlements. The priority targets. The ones giving orders. The ones who aimed best.\nI manipulated the winds of Chamon and focused on the arrowheads. I felt each one. Dozens. I had to focus my entire will on altering their metal structure, shifting the particles until they began to melt in midair.\nThe screams came immediately. One goblin fell from the walls as molten iron burned his cheek and he lost his balance. Another ran in circles, stepping on one of the arrows that had fallen to the ground as a bubbling mass.\nBut the strain was overwhelming. I felt the sweat soaking my neck, and my breath grew heavy. My teeth ached. My fingers trembled.\n\"Now… take them now… advance!\" I managed to shout between gasps, trying to hide how exhausted I was. \"Shoot the goblins while they're disorganized!\"\nMy vision blurred for a second, but I forced myself to stay on my feet. I couldn't show weakness. Not now.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Some goblins began to fall, struck down by the impacts, though many shots missed, thrown off by the dim light or the nerves of battle. Still, chaos spread among the greenskin ranks. Several began abandoning the battlements—without arrows, there was little they could do from up there. Most seemed to retreat deeper inside, likely to prepare a final line of defense.\nFortunately, the goblins hadn't bothered to repair the fortress's main gate. The collapse of stone and charred wood still partially blocked the entrance, but it was passable enough for us to enter in tight formation.\nI waited patiently. I watched as the heat continued to warp the metal atop the walls. Some goblins died without being touched by lead or blade—just by stumbling and falling into the molten iron puddles now scattered across the ground. A miserable death.\nOnce I felt that all the remaining goblins had abandoned the high positions, I ordered my men forward. Pikes at the front, as always. The musketeers positioned themselves in the fourth rank, ready to fire over their comrades if necessary, but without breaking formation.\nI could feel the greenskins. All of them. Like a plague gathering in one single spot.\nWe advanced through the main gates into a great dwarven hall, with high ceilings and walls engraved with ancestral reliefs. The yellow crystals hanging from stone lamps still worked, bathing the room in a soft, warm light. Statues of ancestors, stone-carved runes everywhere, and pillars solid as mountains.\nWe checked the side towers to make sure we didn't leave any enemies at our backs. In one of them, several of my soldiers stopped, stunned: some goblins were still there, literally stuck to the walls, trapped by layers of iron that had solidified over their still-hot bodies.\nWe regrouped and formed ranks. This was the final push. With some luck, it would be the last battle in this fortress. It wasn't a particularly large structure. More like a border keep—an old garrison built to protect a pass or perhaps some valuable resource the dwarves had discovered here centuries ago.\nFinally, we positioned ourselves in front of the heavy stone doors that led to the last redoubt. We pushed them with force. They creaked, opened slowly, and revealed hundreds—perhaps thousands—of goblins crammed into a room far too small for them. They were seeking protection. Shelter. Some huddled behind broken furniture or pillars.\nI gave a single signal with my hand.\nAnd a volley of lead burst from the muskets. The goblins dropped like flies. The drum began to beat, marking the steady pace. Ordering the march. My men advanced with perfect discipline: steady steps, tight formation, pikes at the front.\nWhen the pikes began to pierce the first goblins, the fight—which was already expected to be long—erupted in fury. The push was constant, disciplined. But I... I felt something was wrong. Very wrong.\nThat sensation. That pressure in the chest. That sharp nausea I knew too well… like when enemy drones flew overhead, hunting, stalking. But this was different.\nThe air itself felt rotten.\nI looked around, trying to identify the source. My men moved like a well-oiled machine, impaling goblins by the dozen. Still, the advance was slow—\nNot because of resistance, but sheer numbers. They kept coming, like a tide with no end.\nAnd then I saw it.\nRiding atop a spider the size of a bear—hunched and covered in hair—came a different goblin. Thinner. More jittery. His eyes glowed like green coals, filled with madness. His mouth never stopped moving, gesturing at a sickening speed.\n\"He's a goblin shaman!\" I shouted, pointing with my finger. \"Shoot him! That one! Kill him before he does anything!\"\nThe musketeers reacted instantly. A volley rang out, but most missed or only hit the spider, which screamed in fury but didn't fall. The shaman, unscathed, looked at us with a mixture of hatred and frenzy. He began raising his staff and moving his hands even faster.\n'Shit… he's casting a spell. I have no idea how to stop it. Hieronymus never taught me this,' I thought in despair, feeling cold sweat run down my spine.\nBut then I saw it.\nOn his staff, a decoration: a small carved mushroom, topped with a shining metallic piece. Iron.\nI clung to that detail like a drowning man to driftwood.\nI extended my hand. Pointed as if I were still giving the order to fire. And I channeled everything I had left. All my energy. All the wind of Chamon I had gathered during the battle. I made the iron ornament on the staff start to vibrate—fast. Friction. Sparks. Heat.\nThe metal began to melt, sliding like it had a will of its own. But I didn't let it fall. I forced it up along the staff, like a liquid serpent, and it lunged toward the shaman's neck. There, it solidified immediately—still glowing, still burning.\nThe goblin started screaming. First like a madman. Then like a beast on fire. He fell from the spider and began to writhe on the ground, while the burning chain of iron tightened more and more around his throat, searing flesh and collapsing his airway with every second.\nBut for some reason… the rotten feeling didn't go away. In fact, it worsened. As if the air itself was rotting in my lungs.\nI looked at the shaman, still convulsing in spasms, but I felt something was wrong. The improvised counterspell… maybe it interrupted the incantation, but it didn't stop it completely. The spell had begun. And now it was being unleashed without aim or control.\nThe ground trembled.\nA dull explosion shook the chamber, as if all my powder reserves had gone off at once. The roar echoed against the stone walls, and my ears rang. Smoke rose like hellish breath from the spot where the shaman's body lay, and then…\nGoblins.\nDozens of them were thrown into the air like ragdolls tossed by an invisible storm. They flew over our heads, slammed into walls, crashed onto the floor… or landed on us.\nOne of them fell right on top of me, bursting in an explosion of hot blood, guts, and shattered bones. I felt the impact, felt the ruined flesh on my face, and a moment later—the stench.\n\"Perfect… just what I needed. A goblin blood bath,\" I muttered in disgust, tearing off a piece of spinal cord that had stuck to my breastplate. \"This wasn't part of the plan…\"\nWhere the shaman had once stood, there was now a smoking crater—blackened stone with green flames rising like demonic tongues licking the air.\nApparently, my trick had worked. The spell hadn't completed… but the uncontrolled magical energy had still been released, annihilating all the nearby goblins.\n\"Well done! Whoever hit the mark avoided a catastrophe!\" I shouted—not just to boost morale, but to cover up what I'd done. They didn't need to know it had been me.\nAfter the explosion, the goblins panicked. Whatever discipline they had left collapsed with the shaman's death\nOnly instinct remained: run. But run… where? There was no way out. It didn't matter. Some tried to climb the walls. Others hurled themselves at us, ignoring the fact that our pikes were waiting.\nThe battle ended quickly. Without their leader, the greenskins were hunted down one by one. Some died impaled, others decapitated.\nOnce I no longer sensed any goblin movement, I ordered the withdrawal to secure positions. The wounded were few. Most had only suffered bruises when a flying goblin landed on them after the blast. Painful, yes… but nothing that couldn't be fixed with rest and firm bandages.\nThe cleansing of the fortress continued chamber by chamber. In what seemed to be an old dwarven forge, we found only crude goblin-made weapons, worthless. Further ahead we found the shaman's room—a nest of strange mushrooms in bizarre colors, with dwarven skulls piled up as tribal decoration. A repugnant place, more plague than civilization.\nLater, we came upon what had once been an armory. Empty. Completely looted. Not even the goblins seemed to have gotten much out of it; the only things left were rotten food in broken baskets, mixed with feces and bones.\nIn the final chamber, we found a dwarven statue. Half-destroyed, covered in filth. The carved dwarf's expression was stern, yet dignified—as if even mutilated, it refused to fall fully into disgrace.\nI stood there in silence.\n\"Damn it... I lost men, I've got dozens wounded, and nothing to show for it…,\" I muttered, running a hand over my blood-covered face.\n\"I didn't even come to loot… but I would've expected at least a pile of dwarven gold, a forgotten treasure… something.\"\nThen I felt it.\nA pulse of Chamon.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nNot a strong wind, nor an active one… but an absence. A void. A place where there should have been flow… and there wasn't.\nI turned slowly. Walked in silence to a smooth stone wall. I reached out. Nothing. But something felt wrong. It was as if the wind was being absorbed, as if that spot had no minerals—which was absurd. We were surrounded by iron, tin, and lead.\nI ran my hand over the surface again and again, until my fingers brushed over a groove. Something clicked. A dwarven rune lit up with a faint blue glow.\nThe wall trembled.\nThe stones began to shift, rotating with millimetric precision until they slid aside like a gate of advanced engineering. Before me… a passage.\nI stood in silence for a moment. Then sighed, smacked my forehead with an open palm, and muttered, \"Ah… of course. A secret chamber… why didn't I think of that?\"\nI descended into the chamber. It was perfectly lit by the same yellow crystals that decorated the rest of the fortress, but here they were denser, more intense. The place had a solemn air, almost sacred.\nThere were tombs. Beautifully adorned with polished granite and hammered bronze, each one with a distinct statue of its occupant. On the walls hung the shields of the fallen clan, with inscriptions and runes that even I could feel humming with power. Beside them—swords, axes, and runic hammers. Some armors too, broken and blackened, yet still dignified. Dwarven armor… small for us, yet still imposing.\nI walked slowly, observing in silence.\nThen I felt a draft behind me.\nI turned immediately, hand on the hilt of my sword. Nothing. There was nothing.\n\"Eh… what the hell? How is there wind here?\" I murmured, looking around, both annoyed and unsettled. There were no windows, no visible cracks.\n\"I don't like this place one bit…,\" I whispered as I approached a black stone table. Upon it rested a thick old leather-bound book, older-looking than anything else here.\nI froze in place, not touching it.\n\"Is that… a Dammaz Kron?\" I said softly, narrowing my eyes. It was a Book of Grudges. The sacred book where every offense against a clan was recorded. Only the dwarfs knew what it truly contained…\n\"My lord? Are you here?… By blessed Sigmar…,\" said one of my men-at-arms who had just entered behind me.\nI turned just in time to see him reaching toward a runic sword hanging from the wall, still embedded in its shield.\n\"Don't touch anything. And don't do anything,\" I said sharply, raising my voice and stopping him with a quick step. \"Are you insane!? Do you want your name—or mine—written in the Book of Grudges? Do you want to be cursed by generations of dwarfs?\"\nThe idiot pulled his hand back instantly, recoiling as if the sword had growled at him. He lowered his head without a word.\n\"I want guards posted here, rotating at all times. No one touches anything. I mean it. For the love of Sigmar… not a single hand on anything.\"\nI left the chamber without looking back at the tombs. The man-at-arms followed me in silence.\nAt the threshold, I placed my hand on the side of the door. The runes responded immediately, lighting up with a soft blue glow. The stone trembled slightly, and the walls began to move. The doors slowly and silently sealed once more, hiding the chamber again.\nNo one was to enter there without my permission.\nAnd above all, no one was to provoke the dead.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Not because I expected a reply from him, but because, within the Imperial chain of command, it was the proper way to inform the dwarves without breaking protocol.\nBut that didn't mean our work was done. In fact, the hardest part was just beginning: clearing the fortress. Removing goblin corpses, clearing rubble-filled chambers, and above all, figuring out how not to suffocate in smoke in the process. Luckily, the dwarven forge area had decent ventilation. I had no idea where the air came from, but it flowed, so I ordered the greenskin bodies burned there.\nI left a garrison in the fortress. It was essential to protect the dwarven tombs and ensure the goblins didn't resurface, especially because of the spores they leave behind… or the tunnels. The fortress seemed to be connected to a larger underground network. Some tunnels were clearly dwarven; others visibly dug by goblins, unsecured and crude, as expected from such creatures.\nMeanwhile, work on the new mining town continued. After sending the bodies of our dead to Reinsfeld, the local priest performed the rites needed to protect them from necromancy before they were buried in the cemetery.\nWe kept paving roads and dividing land plots for future housing. I wanted to start building a sewage system, but income had dropped since pigment production slowed. Besides, for a settlement this small, connecting the drainage to the Marienburg Border River was unnecessary… at least for now.\nMy priority was to send most of the new settlers here. I needed miners. The iron in this region was plentiful. So the days passed, focused on expanding the main road, planning farmland, and mapping the town layout.\nThe next shipment of weapons and gunpowder arrived from Reinsfeld, along with steel tools —the first produced in my workshops— and leftover materials from architect Otto's last project.\nBut it wasn't just goods that arrived. People did too.\nWhole groups began migrating to my lands, mostly from Ostermark and Ostland. Apparently, they were tired of living every day fighting off Kislevite raiders, orcs, and whatever else wandered those cursed regions. They had heard that my domains were safe. And they were. Perhaps too much so.\nIn response, I sent riders to reinforce road security. There were no beastmen left in these lands —I had made sure every last one was exterminated— but there were always bandits looking for poorly guarded routes. A few men-at-arms stationed at the garrisons would be enough to ensure more settlers arrived safely.\nHowever, the new migrants looked at me with suspicion. Not like the others. Even though I spoke to them kindly, cordially, even warmly —as I had with every previous group— these people looked at me as if I were an executioner ready to draw his sword.\nI offered them the same deal as always: help building their homes in exchange for a temporary tax deferment. But almost all refused. They said they preferred to build everything themselves.\nIt irritated me deeply. Their stubbornness would lead them to live like rats for years, surrounded by mud, disease, and filth. And I couldn't help them. I almost expelled them, but I knew that would be a death sentence. There are plenty of ways to die out here: the weather, cults, hunger… not much else is needed. So I chose patience. With time, they would adapt.\nMeanwhile, I stayed with my men, paving roads, clearing land, cutting down trees and shrubs in the area where the town would expand. Day after day, without rest.\nMore settlers kept arriving each day. Although I was pleased to see the population growing so quickly, I didn't like that they were all coming from the same provinces of the Empire. In just a few weeks, the settlement had turned into an enclave of Ostermark and Ostland. The population tripled and, before I realized it, this was no longer a Reikland village: it was an eastern outpost of the Empire, with its own customs, dialects, and stubbornness. Exactly what I had wanted to avoid.\nBut there was nothing I could do about it. Moving all those people to Reinsfeld just to balance the cultural percentages wasn't feasible. So I kept my complaints to myself, swallowing my frustration at seeing how, besides rejecting my help, they were now also bringing their traditions and lifestyle as if this were their new Ostermark.\nWe kept working. We only paused when scouts found a small greenskin camp in the mountains. Nothing serious: seventy poorly armed orcs, whom we wiped out with musket fire before they could even mount a proper defense. As soon as they started running, we gave the order to burn everything. That secured the area even further.\nThe houses kept rising. The road stretched farther. And more people arrived each day.\nUntil finally, the message I had been waiting for came. The Emperor had received my letter. He informed the dwarven ambassadors in Altdorf about our discovery. According to the letter, an expedition would be sent by a clan to investigate the fortress and verify the authenticity of the find. That was a week ago. No more than two days passed before a group of dwarves arrived at the mining settlement. All armed, all with grim expressions.\nI dismounted to greet them, making the sign of the twin-tailed comet.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, friends of the Empire,\" I said firmly.\n\"Umgi, I bear no grudge against you…\" began the leader, a dwarf with a long white beard nearly reaching the ground, but he stopped mid-sentence as his eyes narrowed, staring at my arms. His gaze hardened at once. \"Those bracers… where did you get them?\"\n\"These bracers were acquired legally, noble dawi,\" I replied quickly, keeping my voice calm. \"Their ownership was transferred in accordance with the shared customs of men and dwarves. They came from a runesmith living in Marienburg. If you wish, I can send a rider to retrieve the purchase order. It is signed and sealed.\"\nSilence fell over the group for a few seconds. All the dwarves watched me with suspicion.\nFinally, the leader nodded. \"Very well, umgi. I won't distrust the man who freed a karak from a greenskin plague. Lead the way.\"\n\"This way, noble dawi,\" I said respectfully, guiding them to the mine's main entrance. The sound of our boots echoed against the stone as we descended.\n\"I apologize in advance if this offends you, but… do you know how to read Reikspiel?\" I asked as we moved through a secondary gallery.\n\"Yes, umgi,\" he replied curtly, not taking his eyes off the path.\n\"Then take this.\" I handed him my campaign notebook. \"I wrote this while we were reclaiming the kazad. It details everything we faced, how we fought, and the methods we used to take each chamber.\"\nThe dwarf took the book without stopping or responding. He simply tucked it under his arm and kept walking.\nWe arrived at the site where the soldiers' camp had been, guarding the entrance. Only a few tents and extinguished campfires remained.\nThe dwarven leader stopped and looked around. The ceiling and walls were blackened.\n\"What happened here?\" he asked, examining the charred remains carefully.\n\"They were breeding spiders here, noble dawi. We set the place on fire, and everything exploded within seconds. The webs burned like oil—especially because of the giant spider... the size of a house.\" I pointed to the book. \"It's described on page four.\"\nThe dwarf nodded and kept reading as we moved through the main halls of the fortress. We passed through the corridors where the goblin massacre had occurred. Now cleansed of the blood that once stained every stone, they looked like a true dwarven stronghold once again.\nI led him straight to the tombs, where I had gathered all the bones of the dwarves I found scattered across the fortress. As we entered, the dwarven leader lifted his gaze from the book and looked at me.\n\"You say the tombs were looted… but these bones?\"\n\"These are the remains found in various parts of the fortress,\" I replied calmly. \"I don't know the funerary rites of the dawi, so… I gathered them here, in what seemed to be a cemetery of the original inhabitants. Many of them…,\" I hesitated for a moment, \"...had been used as decoration by the greenskins. This was the only thing I could think of to give them a little dignity back.\"\nThe dwarf looked at me for a moment longer, then turned and spoke to his kin in Khazalid. One by one, they approached the piles of bones and skulls, kneeling and removing their helmets in a gesture of respect.\n\"Let's go,\" said the leader. \"They will handle giving them the peace they deserve.\"\nI nodded and continued guiding him toward the heart of the kazad. He didn't need much explanation; he seemed to understand for himself what had happened in each room of that section of the fortress. When we reached the great throne room, he came to a sudden halt.\n\"That hole…\" he murmured, pointing at a scorched crater in the floor, \"…that was a goblin shaman, wasn't it? Lost control and exploded.\"\n\"Yes,\" I answered simply. I let him walk at his own pace. He examined the looted armory, the destroyed forge, the clan lord's chamber, and finally the room where the great central statue rested. His expression was hard to read—a mix of sorrow and critical assessment.\n\"Ah… there's something I didn't include in the book.\" I walked over to one of the side walls, extended my hand, and touched an old rune carved into a stone slab. It glowed softly under my touch, and a faint tremor ran through the stone as a hidden mechanism activated silently.\nI turned. The dwarf was staring at me, eyes wide.\n\"That rune… it's designed to react only to members of the clan… or friends of the clan,\" he said, incredulous.\n\"Really? I never met anyone from the clan myself,\" I said casually, descending the stairway that had just opened. \"I just made sure to protect this place and cause as little damage as possible. By the way… I haven't taken anything from here.\"\nFrom the foot of the stairs, I looked back. He hadn't moved.\n\"Of course I believe you,\" he finally said, starting to descend. \"If you had, the rune would have sealed. You'd be trapped.\"\n\"I think this book is important… It's a Dammaz Kron, right?\" I asked, pointing at the tome lying on the black stone table.\n\"Yes… so at least we'll know who to aim our wrath at,\" said the dwarf, approaching the book with reverent care, mouth slightly ajar.\nHe spoke a few words in Khazalid and opened the tome. He immersed himself in the reading, and we remained silent as he turned page after page. Occasionally he murmured the word Dammaz. Eventually, he closed the book and looked at me directly.\n\"Forgive me, Custodian, for having doubted your nobility. But you must understand—I've seen too many umgi take what belongs to the dwarves. I thought this was just another case.\"\n\"Bah… don't worry about it. It was my fault not to have the purchase order ready, knowing you'd eventually come. What matters now is… what will happen to this karak?\" I asked, more casually.\n\"This fortress belonged to Clan Grundkaraz. They mined gromril, though I suspect the vein dried up long ago and this became an outpost. That's their crest.\" He pointed at a stone engraved with the emblem of a pick crossed with what looked like a chunk of ore. \"But if my memory serves me… there are still surviving members of this bloodline in Karak Norn.\"\n\"I understand the part about heritage and rights, noble dawi. But according to the decree of the Emperor, confirmed by the dwarven ambassadors from Karak Norn, Karaz-a-Karak, and Karak Azgaraz, I've been granted mining rights over these mountains.\" I crossed my arms, keeping my tone level.\n\"The treaty between our kings and the Emperor still stands, Custodian. No one will question the honor of a friend to this clan. If the old lineage wants to resettle here, they'll have to negotiate mining rights with you,\" the dwarf replied firmly.\n\"Very well… then will you take over protection of the karak now?\" I asked, hoping to relieve my men from tunnel watch duty.\n\"I must return to Altdorf to report to the ambassador of Karak Norn and the other delegates. So I expect you to continue fulfilling your duty as Custodian until more dawi arrive,\" said the leader, stepping closer. \"But more importantly… you must return this Dammaz Kron to its rightful owner.\"\nHe handed me the book.\n\"Eh… shouldn't that be your job?\" I asked as I took it, feeling its weight.\n\"It is your right, Custodian. And your duty. Just as mine is to report. That journal you wrote will serve well,\" he said, pointing at the diary I had given him earlier.\n\"Then I'll keep it here, below. I doubt there's a safer place in the region… not even in my castle. As for guarding this karak, I've seen goblin tunnels and others of dwarven make. There may be more strongholds nearby. But, as much as I want to fulfill my duty as a servant of Sigmar and friend of the dawi, I'm short on funds. I won't be able to launch another campaign at least until after the harvest. And with winter… probably not until next year.\"\n\"Don't worry, Custodian. The dwarves will repay this debt,\" he said with a smile, running a hand through his long braided beard.\n\"I didn't do it for a reward, noble dawi…\" I lied smoothly. \"Only to fulfill my duty as a Sigmarite and help our friends in the mountains.\"\n\"Walk with honor,\" said the dwarf, nodding solemnly. Then he turned and began his departure from the fortress.",

All the families in Reinsfeld, up to last month, are registered in the land registry. We know exactly when to begin collecting taxes for this harvest.\"\n\"Also, according to the workers' reports, we have the exact amount each one earns recorded. Since you have the payrolls, we can easily determine what they owe in taxes, depending on your instructions,\" added another collector.\n\"I see…\" I murmured while reviewing the documents they had handed me. I immediately noticed they were printed in my own workshops. \"I assume you got this from my stationery, right?\" I asked, raising the papers.\n\"Yes…\" answered the youngest, though the others remained silent.\n\"Good. Then I suppose the administrative costs should drop considerably. After all, producing paper costs me nothing…\" I said, without taking my eyes off them.\nThe tension in the room became palpable.\n\"I asked my favorite servant to acquire certain specific books for me. I'm still waiting for the shipment of goats to arrive so I can work their leather and make my own volumes... But let's make one thing clear: here,\" I said, pointing to the notebooks I placed on the table, \"you will record how much each of you collects, indicating the tax number assigned to each household. When a family pays, they will be given a valid receipt for the year, signed and sealed using this smaller ledger.\"\nI paused, noting that they were paying close attention.\n\"When you're done, you'll hand over all the books to me, and I will personally review how much has actually entered the coffers. Also, you will give these other accounting books to all merchants and tradesmen who own property in Reinsfeld. In them, they must record all their income and expenses, and present them to me at the time of tax collection.\"\nI took the last of the books and placed it in the hands of the oldest collector.\n\"This way I'll avoid anyone lying to me about their income. And remember well: tell the artisans that losing their hands over a few coins isn't worth it.\"\nI finished by handing over the records, in complete silence.\n\"Any more questions, or are you just staring at my face?\" I asked with irritation in my voice.\n\"My lord… well… according to tradition, under your father… we had the right to one-fifteenth of everything collected as annual payment. My question is… how much will it be this year?\" said the eldest of the collectors, somewhat uneasy.\n\"Oh yes… let me see… Nothing.\" I placed my hands firmly on the table. \"From now on, I'll pay you a fixed salary. Don't give me those faces. Ungrateful bastards… You'll still be well paid, but just so you don't feel irreplaceable: I only need to go to Altdorf, offer that same salary to anyone who can read, and I'll have dozens of applicants. And thanks to this system, your usual 'tactics' are no longer necessary to me.\"\nTheir expressions twisted instantly.\n\"And how much will that salary be?\" asked the youngest, clearly afraid of the answer.\n\"One crown a day… while the general tax collection lasts this month,\" I replied, crushing their hopes. \"The rest of the year, just five shillings a day. Enough for you to keep working properly.\"\nThey looked defeated. Clearly, they had thought about how to fill their pockets with taxes from the new merchants who had arrived in Reinsfeld since the population tripled. Perhaps they imagined charging 'special fees' to artisans, who with more orders were also getting richer. But their fantasies ended here.\n\"So go do your job. And remember: I'm watching you. I don't want any 'irregularities'…\" I smiled. \"If that happens, there will be irregularities with your necks.\"\nWith that meeting over, I had another place to visit—one that caught everyone's attention: the harvest fields, like almost everyone in town. Nearly all of Reinsfeld's life had moved there in the last month. Everyone was harvesting what they had been planting all year, hoping it was finally ready… and eager to pay me with a big smile. Feeding an army of over a thousand men isn't cheap.\nBut unlike the others, I was one of the few in town who had serfs working the land for me. Although many farmers here are free men, not tied to the land, others are. And in the eyes of the law, they are my property.\nHowever, my visit wasn't to supervise them. There was something else I was interested in.\nOn purpose, I had certain fields worked exactly like the local peasants did. No fertilizers, or steel tools. Just their traditional techniques. Entire hectares planted following the town's methods, without any improvements.\nWhy? Because that gave me a perfect estimate of how much they had actually harvested.\nI had fields of wheat, barley, potatoes… almost everything grown in Reinsfeld was also present on my land. But unlike theirs, my fields were under strict observation and accounting. When they began harvesting, threshing, or digging up tubers, and the sacks piled up one after another, I had the exact weights. I could compare them to last year's figures. I knew exactly how much their fields had yielded.\nI'll probably become the most hated noble in the Empire when it comes to taxes. But few can surpass me in how relentless I am about making sure what's owed is paid. I'm also one of the few non-urban nobles who employs professional tax collectors instead of clumsy servants who collect once a year and pocket half of it.\nIt's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.\nEither I make my formulas public, allow them to be copied, and lose my monopoly… or I keep everything under lock and key, constantly alternate between producing pigments and gunpowder, and preserve my advantage.\nAnd between both options, I will always prefer the monopoly.Because without competition, there is no threat.\nOut in the fields, I watched as my serfs worked to harvest all the grain and vegetables. With a moderately sized workforce, they finished within a few hours—very different from the free peasants, who were only just beginning their harvest.\nThen came the threshing of the grain and the cleaning of the vegetables, many still covered in dirt. Fortunately, manual threshers were common: the carpenter knew how to make them well. They only needed regular-sized stones set into wooden frames. You passed the wheat, barley, or oats through, and what remained were the grains. The straw was kept separately, useful for livestock or other functions in the village.\nAll the grain was then bagged, separated by type, just like the vegetables. Then began the weighing, plot by plot.\nWheat yielded just over a ton per hectare, which—compared to previous years—was a very good harvest. Barley and rye reached a ton and a half per hectare, also excellent results. Turnips exploded in yield: nearly 25 tons per hectare. No wonder it was so common to see entire fields of turnips—no one would starve, even if the taste left much to be desired. Potatoes came in at 13 tons per hectare, carrots at 15, and onions nearly 30. Legumes yielded just over one ton per hectare.\nAs for cash crops, flax yielded one ton per hectare. We also tried to replicate some tricks from the farms of the Cult of Shallya by planting many healing herbs. But for some reason, everything went wrong. Almost the entire harvest rotted. Only about twenty kilograms of useful plants were salvaged, gathered from various fields. A total failure.\nThese were the average yields per hectare. It wasn't a single sample: we used multiple fields in different zones to establish a reliable average. With that, the collectors would be given precise values so they could charge taxes with absolute certainty based on the harvest. This avoided clever peasants trying to hide part of the yield, not bringing it to the mill, or underreporting if they grew something other than wheat, which was easier to measure.\nIt could be said without a doubt: this was a great harvest. There had been plenty of rain, but not so much as to drown the plants. This year would be excellent for income. But unlike previous years—when my father had to sell almost the entire harvest to merchants just to gather enough gold and keep the administration afloat—I had no such urgency.ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nI had other sources of income besides horses. That gave me room to invest in new projects. And with winter approaching, I could expect a long period of stability and peace, where I could continue increasing production.\nEspecially in what truly mattered: better food processing.\nSo, very pleased with the results of this year—though I hope the next will be even better, as I plan to introduce tools, fertilizers, and new techniques to the peasants—I felt generous. Especially with the serfs, who received no pay for their work, as it was their duty to labor for me a few months each year as a form of tax.\nBefore releasing them to harvest their own fields, I allowed them to take two sacks of whichever crop they chose. With such an abundant harvest, that meant the loss of only a tiny fraction of the total.\nWhen the news spread, I saw many smiles. I heard loud thanks—to Sigmar, to Taal, to Rhya, and even to Shallya.\nI mounted my horse and began the return to the village while my guards handled the organization and escort of the food transport back to Reinsfeld.\nI was considering experimenting with large-scale food preservation. I couldn't use cans, no matter how much I wanted to, but I could use glass jars. Though I still had to buy them from Schilderheim, as we didn't yet have a local glassblower. Perhaps I could hire one and also use him for another project: building a greenhouse.\nBeing able to cultivate year-round would be, both logistically and militarily, one of the best investments I could make. Having a constant food supply—not subject to the seasons—would provide a freedom of movement that no other feudal lord would enjoy. While the Empire's peasants were bound to plow, sow, and harvest on strict schedules, I could wage military campaigns even in winter, knowing my people would remain supplied.\nAnd if I wanted to keep clearing the mountains of greenskins, inside or outside my domain, that would make the difference between a risky offensive and a planned victory.\nGiven the excellent flax harvest, I wanted to see how the carpenter was progressing with my loom orders. I could soon start producing clothing—at least for military use—and standardize the garments worn by my soldiers under the armor I could provide. But as I approached the town, I noticed a crowd of peasants gathered outside the castle, while my guards were doing their best to contain them.\n\"Oh shit,\" I muttered, reaching for my sword.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Once more soldiers began to emerge, I finally made my appearance, riding through the crowd who barely noticed me as I passed on horseback.\nAmid all the noise, only one thing truly caught my attention: a sign with words painted on it—poorly written, but familiar. It was a phrase that made the reason for the protest perfectly clear: \"REIKLADN FOR THE REIKLADSERS,\" and the spelling mistake clearly marked the peasant origin of its author.\nThe crowd slowly grew as more peasants arrived from the fields after finishing their harvest day. Some didn't even go home first; they joined the protest directly.\nOnce I was surrounded by my men, I approached to a safe distance and stopped. I remained completely silent, wearing a harsh, stern expression like a statue on horseback. My mere presence seemed to take effect: the shouting died down, the complaints turned to murmurs, and then to complete silence.\nI looked at them one by one, as if memorizing their faces.\n\"Only one of you will speak,\" I finally said, raising my voice so that all could hear. \"And by blessed Sigmar, you'd better explain clearly why this is happening!\"\nI didn't mention the maximum penalty for rebellion, though it was at the tip of my tongue. It wasn't the time.\nThere was a moment of hesitation, people looking at one another, until a man stepped forward. His hair was graying, and his hands were rough from years of fieldwork.\n\"Because… because our customs are dying, my lord,\" he said in a trembling tone. \"Large groups of outsiders are arriving in our lands. And you… you do nothing. On the contrary, you support them. You allow them to tarnish the name of our god Sigmar, bringing with them lesser gods like Ulric or Taal. It's clear where your favor lies. Look at their homes, my lord… and look at ours. I built mine with my own hands, with effort and suffering. And they, these outsiders, arrive and are given homes that would befit the notables of the village. On top of that, they get tax exemptions…\" he finally shouted, full of anger.\nThe murmurs became a chorus. Many began to nod and shout in agreement, supporting every word of the man.\n\"Outsiders?... Outsiders?\" I calmly repeated, looking down at him. \"Have you forgotten that our divine lord Deus Sigmar forged this Empire by uniting all tribes? Every one of those you call 'outsiders' is a son of the Empire. A man of Sigmar.\"\nI watched them sternly.\n\"But I understand your point of view, my loyal subjects,\" I added, in a more measured tone. \"As a Sigmarite, I shall fulfill my duty to protect all the inhabitants of the Empire… and I shall also fulfill my duty to listen to my people.\"\nI paused briefly, letting my words settle.\n\"You have until sunset to choose a group of delegates and send them to my office. Let them bring all your complaints, all your doubts, all your grievances. With the blessing of Deus Sigmar, I hope we'll find a solution… for every action has its cause, and every decision demands listening. Let your delegates speak their truth before I deliver justice, for justice without understanding is nothing but blind punishment.\"\nWith that, I turned my horse as my men cleared the path firmly. The crowd didn't disperse, but it did retreat, tension still hanging in the air.\nI ascended to the castle fuming inwardly at the stupidity of the protest. As much as I would've liked to shout at them and issue threats right then and there, that wasn't the way to end a revolt. This was the moment to divide them… and conquer them one by one.\nOnly an idiot—or someone with exceptional charisma—would try to calm a mob when they're inciting each other like frightened animals.\nI am neither.\nSo I remained, ordering that those who wished to speak come to me one by one. Everything was to be handled privately. Once the leaders were calmed, the protest would die quickly: I'd regain control, fulfill part of what was promised… and things would return to normal.\nAs I waited patiently, the first peasant entered. He was visibly tense, surrounded by guards, and most importantly—alone.\n\"Greetings, my good subject. Tell me, why do I have the honor of your presence in my castle?\" I asked in a calm and friendly tone.\n\"Uh… my lord…\" he muttered, almost hyperventilating.\n\"Calm yourself, good man. You have my word there will be no reprisals for your participation,\" I said gently, as I poured a wooden cup of wine—the same kind my father used to drink. \"Here, drink. Steady your nerves,\" I added with a smile that seemed sincere, though it was nothing but part of the performance.\nThe man accepted the cup and drank, savoring every sip as if it were the best thing he'd tasted in weeks.\n\"Better?\" I asked courteously.\n\"Yes, my lord… forgive the intrusion,\" he answered, bowing his head.\n\"It is never a burden to listen to my subjects. Never forget that.\" I gestured with my hand. \"Please, tell me what my people request.\"\n\"Well… my lord… there is discomfort over the number of soldiers arriving from other provinces… and well, they don't seem very trustworthy. They're very quiet, distant… unlike our own men,\" the peasant said, visibly uncomfortable.\n\"That may be hard to accept, but they have bled for us. Don't forget that. Thanks to them, the forests are safe, the roads are guarded, and the mountains pacified. Have they not already proven their loyalty?\" I replied calmly.\n\"Uh… I know… but there are so many… if one day they chose to betray you, my lord…\" the man said, leaving the sentence hanging.\n\"That will never happen. Not while I draw breath.\" I paused, interlacing my fingers. \"But I understand the concern. You would feel more at ease if next year I hired two hundred more guards… preferably from Reikland, correct?\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" said the man, now with a more genuine smile.\n\"Is there anything else I should know?\"\n\"No, my lord. That was the main concern among the neighbors near the market,\" he replied.\n\"I understand… tell me something. What led you to make such a risky decision? If my father still ruled, you'd all have lost your heads by now,\" I said seriously.\nThat question made him tense up immediately.\n\"Well… uh… someone at the tavern said this would never happen with… with…\"\n\"With who?\" I pressed.Follow current novᴇls on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"With the von Kesselheims,\" he finally replied.\n\"I see…\" I murmured, pouring him another cup of wine. \"If you have nothing else to say, you may leave,\" I added as I filled his cup.\nThe man nodded, drank quickly, and left—visibly happier than he deserved to be.\n\"Idiot,\" I muttered under my breath just as I heard his last steps echoing down the hall.\n\"So the von Kesselheims… subversive sons of bitches,\" I growled with contempt. \"Taking advantage of public unrest over the migrants to try and reclaim their land… Five generations without ruling, and now that they see there's something to squeeze, they show up to snatch it from the mouth of the one who worked it. Parlor rats,\" I hissed through my teeth.\nAnother delegate didn't take long to arrive, this one smiling. He'd probably spoken with the previous one. I treated him the same way: with respect and courtesy, presenting myself as a virtuous nobleman to send the message that I was approachable.\n\"My lord, you cannot build a cathedral for the followers of Taal and Rhya… First and foremost, we are Sigmarites. We cannot allow our God and Lord to be considered lesser compared to minor deities,\" he said, with a mixture of indignation and concern.\n\"You do know that the Cult of Taal would never ask for—much less accept—a stone cathedral, right? We're talking about the god of nature. Their temples are wooden chapels, made of mud, with roofs of branches and animal hides. Where did you get such nonsense?\" I replied calmly, letting just a trace of contempt slip into my tone.\n\"So… it was all a lie?\" he asked, incredulous.\n\"Of course. If I had large sums of money to support a cult, the first would be that of our Lord Deus Sigmar. How could anyone believe I'd do something like that?\" I said, now more sternly, looking him directly in the eye.\n\"I…\" the man murmured, lowering his head. \"I won't waste any more of your valuable time, my lord. Please forgive the trouble.\"\n\"Before you go… where did you hear that lie?\" I asked without changing my tone.\n\"In the plaza, my lord. A man was saying you had agreed to build a cathedral for Taal… instead of allocating resources to the Cult of Sigmar,\" he replied, now visibly uncomfortable.\nI gestured for him to leave.\nThat continued for a long while—hearing complaint after complaint from the townsfolk. They all revolved around the same topic: the migrants. Why were they exempt from taxes? Why were they given new, well-built houses, while lifelong residents still lived in crumbling shacks? Why did they get help, and not us?\nOnce again, the same issue: a stupid rumor that got out of hand. The houses given to migrants weren't a gift. They came with a catch: they had to pay rent, and their tax exemption was gradually reduced. I also used the imperial decree as an excuse, claiming I had no authority to revoke their benefits… Which was a lie. I could declare the agreement void at any time and send them begging. But in matters like these, the appearance of integrity is worth more than the truth.\nAnd as if that weren't enough, the latest rumor said I had multiple lovers among the migrant women, and that's why I gave them everything so generously.\n\"For fuck's sake… I'm twelve years old. Twelve. And even though I'm abnormally tall for my age, have my peasants completely lost their minds? How the hell do they believe something like that?\" I muttered through clenched teeth as I poured myself a cup of vinegar water.\nAnother group came to complain about jobs—especially the local craftsmen. With the arrival of the migrants came new artisans, which led to unexpected competition. Some spoke of oversupply; others said the customer base was splitting too fast. Several, indignantly, claimed they were competing against people who didn't pay taxes.\nAnother stupid rumor.\nI had to explain that the tax exemption I'd granted only applied to harvests, not to commercial activity. Everyone selling in the market—whether from Reikland or Talabecland—paid the same tax on their products. Nothing could be fairer. I also pointed out that the population increase attracted more merchants, simply because the market was larger, more dynamic… more profitable. In other words: they were selling more because there were more people.\nOf course, explaining that to someone who thinks the world revolves around their carpentry stall isn't easy.\nThen came another issue. They wanted me to hire more Reiklanders in my private businesses. Many complained that migrants were working in my forges and foundries. I responded with all the calm I had left that all the positions were filled. That if there were unemployed Reiklanders, of course I'd prefer them… but there were no vacancies. And I wasn't going to fire someone just because of where they were born.\nThe next round of complaints, finally, had merit. Otto, the architect, had been digging beneath the old quarter of the town to continue work on the sewer system. In doing so, he had damaged the foundations of several old houses, causing cracks and subsidence. The owners were furious—and rightly so. They wanted compensation or help repairing their homes before winter.\nI promised to give them an answer soon—either repairs or direct assistance. And I called Otto immediately.\n\"Your digging is damaging my peasants' homes. Did you miscalculate?\" I asked tensely.\n\"My calculations are perfect,\" Otto said, crossing his arms with that know-it-all arrogance.\n\"Then explain why I've got villagers complaining that their foundations are sinking or that their walls are cracking.\"\n\"Because they built with crap materials,\" he replied, unfazed. \"The wood they used is rotted. It should've been replaced years ago.\"\nI took a deep breath. A very deep one. I ran a hand over my face.\n\"Winter is upon us and there are still migrants without shelter. Leave the damn sewer for now. We'll finish it next year, or extend it toward the new houses. For now, focus on repairing the damaged homes and making sure no one sleeps outside when the snow comes.\"\n\"That'll extend the contract,\" he said, trying to choose his words carefully.\n\"Yes, yes… yes. I'll pay you what's fair, bastard. Now get back to work.\"\nOtto nodded, satisfied he'd be getting paid for a while longer, and left without haste, as if nothing could bother him.\nI was left alone, in silence, staring out the window as the sky began to cloud over.\n\"Why the hell does nothing ever go right?\" I muttered, exhausted.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The spine creaked like old bones, and the dust tickled my nose.\n\"Apparently, the Kesselheims were the former rulers of Reinsfeld back when this land was nothing but mud, oaks, and barefoot peasants. This was during the time of Magnus the Pious. There were local conflicts over control of the territory, and my family, still commoners then, supported the right side. Since nobody wanted this hole with no castle or navigable rivers, it was handed over to us as a prize. My ancestor achieved what many landless nobles dream of: becoming someone.\"\nI flipped through a few more pages, looking for more details.\n\"And yes, we kicked them out. Drove them off like rats,\" I said with an ironic smile.\n\"Two generations later, my grandfather had to deal with them too. They tried to take back what they had lost. Four great-uncles and a bunch of distant relatives died, but we won. Again.\"\nI continued reading, my brow furrowed.\n\"And my father… of course, they never knew when to give up. As soon as he sat on the baron's throne, another attempt. This time he personally slit the throats of two of the Kesselheim leader's sons. Four more of my uncles and three cousins died. That's why I have no family. Because of those bastards.\"\nI closed the book hard and left it on the oak desk.\n\"The problem is, where are they getting the gold? Every time they think they can bite, they come back. Who's funding them? Who gives them weapons, men, and hope?\"\nI searched for more references.\n\"Nothing. Just note after note about how persistent they are. They're there, waiting for me to die. And the worst part is… if they kill me, they win. I have no legal heir. My brother is disinherited. My mother is locked away in a Shallyan temple in Altdorf. There's no one left.\"\nThat was when I heard the footsteps. The metallic sound of a wheelbarrow screeching over the stone floor echoed in. Rutger appeared, sweaty and tense, pushing it. On top of it, a reinforced chest.\n\"My lord,\" said Rutger, bowing his head. \"These are the profits from the trip.\"\nHe stopped and opened the chest. Golden coins gleamed under the candlelight.\n\"I sold the pigment for 7,000 crowns,\" he began listing. \"The soap for 1,000, the paper for 2,000, and some steel tools for 400. After subtracting my share… a little over ten thousand crowns net.\"\nI watched his expression: tense, uneasy, jaw slightly clenched.\n\"Something happened?\" I asked in a neutral tone. \"You look nervous.\"\nRutger lowered his gaze and replied:\n\"Mages from the Gold College stopped me while I was offering the paper at the university and colleges in Altdorf. They confiscated part of the pigment… and forced me to sell it to them. Though I admit, they paid more than usual.\"\nI frowned.\n\"They forced you?\" I asked, now more serious.\n\"Yes, my lord,\" he answered. \"They bombarded me with questions. Wanted to know where we got it from. They've been searching for it for weeks. Desperate to buy it directly from the producer. I told them we bought it from a Bretonnian merchant… to raise the price a little more.\"\nI leaned my elbow on the desk and ran a hand down my face.\nOf course… the pigment. It draws the Winds of Chamon. The elf had already mentioned it—useful in enchanting rituals. If an elven spellcaster was interested, why wouldn't the gold alchemists be?\n\"And did they believe you?\" I finally asked.\n\"Yes,\" said Rutger. \"Though I tried to negotiate, they wouldn't offer any more gold.\"\nI nodded slowly and took a sip of water from the goblet. I set the glass down and looked at him with a frown.\n\"Wait… those bastards didn't give you lead coins, did they? They're more than capable of that,\" I said, narrowing my eyes.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ\nRutger's eyes widened immediately, clearly caught off guard.\n\"No… no… I didn't think of that… I…\" he stammered, visibly shaken.\n\"Relax,\" I said, raising my hand calmly. \"It's not that serious. If there's anything strange with the gold, we'll sue the College. Defrauding a noble is a serious crime—they'd be stripped of their robes. But next time, take the gold to a priest of Sigmar and ask if he senses any magic in it. Understood?\"\nRutger nodded several times, still tense.\nThen I looked at him again, my face serious.\n\"By the way, Rutger… do you know any nobles named Kesselheim?\"\n\"Yes,\" he answered without hesitation. \"They have several workshops in Altdorf and lots of farmland on the outskirts. Do you want me to try doing business with them?\"\nI stared at him in silence for a few seconds.\n\"What's their main business?\"\n\"Jewelry. And exclusive wines for noble circles,\" said Rutger. \"They're quite wealthy. If you've found something in the mines that might interest a jeweler, I could—\"\n\"No,\" I interrupted immediately. \"Try not to get too close to them. Or bad things might happen to you.\"\nMy voice dropped in tone, and each word carried weight.\n\"They are mortal enemies of my family. They're already sharpening their fangs, I've no doubt. I wouldn't be surprised if they were behind my father's death. So be careful.\"\nRutger swallowed and nodded before quietly leaving to start loading goods onto the wagons.\nOnce I was alone, I approached the chest and took a few coins. I ran my fingers over the gold, then closed my eyes. I let my power flow gently, scanning the pieces carefully. I felt no magical disturbance, no trace of illusion.\nReal gold.\nI let out a relieved sigh.\n\"That was close. If those bastards from the Gold College had paid me with enchanted lead…\"\nI shut the chest and stood in front of it, rubbing my face.\n\"Damn it. Now I have to be wary even of the Empire's spellcasters. If one skilled enough gets close to my objects and sees what they really are… I'm screwed.\"\nI turned to the window, breathing deeply. The air smelled of soil and harvest. I forced myself to calm down.\n\"Alright… breathe. I've got enough gold to pay wages, cover Otto's increased contract, and still have some left over. If the harvest yields as I expect, I could make another twenty, maybe thirty thousand crowns. A good year for my coffers.\"\nI smiled faintly, crossing my arms.\n\"We just need to process everything properly. That'll be enough to finance another military campaign in the Grey Mountains… or maybe find a new target where I can test my forces.\"\nThe real problem was figuring out how to strike back at the damned Kesselheims.\nBeing in Altdorf, any move had to be handled with extreme care. If I were caught attempting an assassination or the kidnapping of one of their notables —who surely had friends among the city's noble circles and judges— I'd find myself trapped in a legal nightmare with no escape. A costly, slow trial where my chances of winning would be slim. Meanwhile, they could move freely, hidden behind favors and legal masks. And of course, they'd never send a pawn stupid enough to carry any evidence that could implicate them.\nThe most sensible option would be to provoke them. Force a fight outside the village, away from witnesses. In open ground, turning their armor into bubbling steel would be enough to resolve the matter quickly. Maybe a couple of minor witch hunters would show up, an official investigation, but nothing I couldn't handle with a few favors, donations to the Temple of Sigmar, and a convincing performance.\n\"I could send someone to burn down their granaries… yes, something that hurts,\" I murmured, calculating the timing.\nI slapped my face lightly a couple of times to clear my head.\n\"All right. I can't dream of keeping a large army if I don't have the means to sustain it. So… let's get to work,\" I told myself, forcing a smile.\nI decided to use the momentum to take care of something more productive.\nI descended the castle hill accompanied by several of my men. It hadn't been long since the protests, and there could still be vermin snooping around —Kesselheim spies, agitators, or idiots looking to become martyrs. And as long as I was in the village, I couldn't use my magic carelessly: the priest of Sigmar had a sharp sensitivity. If he sensed magic flowing in the middle of the street, he'd start asking questions.\nWe finally arrived at the carpenter's workshop. The looms were waiting for me. At last.\nAbout forty of them, ready to be moved. With this, I could begin standardizing the uniforms of my soldiers. So far, we had only managed to outfit them uniformly in chainmail —which was already more than most Imperial troops could say. But plate armor… plate armor was still a luxury, and production was busy with other priorities.\nFor now, the focus had to stay on the muskets. Train a large reserve, mass-produce them, and have them ready as backup. If one day I needed to arm the populace in a matter of hours, I could. If I wanted to sell them, I'd have buyers.\nI took the looms to one of the new workshops Otto had built in the Reinsfeld industrial zone. The building had just been finished in time. With the help of my men, we began installing the machines inside.\nIt didn't take long before the machinery was ready. Only one thing was missing: hands to make it work.\nSomeone to turn flax into fabric, and maybe some of the cotton brought to me from Araby. Though cotton, damn it, is useless in winter. If it gets wet, there's no way to dry it in time, and you end up with a pile of corpses coughing blood.\nThis time I decided to keep one of the promises I made to the townsfolk: to give hiring preference to Reiklanders.\nThe problem was, most of them were still busy with the harvest. But since it was nearly finished, people were becoming available. It didn't take long to gather around a hundred and twenty villagers willing to work in textile production, and another eighty who agreed to take on the sewing. A new, large industry I had funded with a not-insignificant investment. It had to work. No matter what.\nBut there was a small issue: no one had the slightest idea what they were doing.\nI had an enthusiastic workforce, willing to work for two shillings a day, but completely ignorant of the trade. So, as if I didn't already have enough on my plate, I had to teach them personally how the looms worked —just as the carpenter had explained to me—, how to treat the flax, how to prepare the cotton so it wouldn't jam the spinner, how to spin, how to stretch the thread, and how to produce fabric that didn't look like it came from a grain sack.\nA complete production chain, step by step, to ensure consistency.\nAnd most importantly, to dye all that clothing with my blue pigment.\nI want all my men wearing that blue. By the Winds of Chamon. Because if that damned pigment truly draws the Wind of Metal, as the elf, Hieronymus, and my own experiences producing it all claimed, then there's no reason not to use it. An army wrapped in a cloud of magic winds makes it easier for me to cast spells. And if anyone asks, I'll just say it's my favorite color.\nSo I spent hours —whole hours— working with the peasants. Teaching them a clear sequence: how to process flax, how to clean and stretch the cotton, how to feed the loom. Then I moved on to the sewing team. I showed them which pieces I needed in bulk: tunics, durable trousers, thick cloaks for winter.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

But between that, and having to assign homes to the new migrants, I didn't have a moment to breathe.\nThe most important thing was carefully controlling who received which house. I made sure the new neighborhoods were balanced — homes distributed among migrants from different provinces. One from Ostland on the right, one from Middenland on the left, one from Talabecland across the street. No one liked it, of course, but it was necessary. That way I avoided the formation of ghettos, and at least for now, the strategy was working.\nLuckily, the migrants complained in silence. Unlike the Reiklanders, they didn't protest openly. Most had come out of desperation — fleeing hunger, the harsh punishments of their former lords, or lands plagued by danger. They didn't like having to adapt, but they understood it was that or freeze to death in the snow. With winter at the gates and no roof over their heads, any complaint was swallowed down with a bit of hard bread.\nAnd compared to the hardheaded ones who had recently protested —lying about everything they said— these new neighbors were a blessing.\nAfter finishing my duties for the day, I finally decided to go to the chapel of Sigmar. This time it wasn't just a courtesy visit. I wanted to do something different. For the first time since I started all this, I was going to make a long-term investment directly in the village. Something that, in the future, would allow me to benefit even more from their labor.\nMy intention was to found the first Sigmarite military school in Reinsfeld.\nAn institution to train children from a young age — not only in reading, writing, and arithmetic, but also in discipline, obedience, physical training, and —with Shallya's favor— the basics of healing.\nClearly, I needed support. Material, political, and financial support. I didn't plan on funding everything myself. Between books, benches, teachers, infrastructure, food, uniforms, and everything else, the cost would be enormous. But if I could get the Cult of Sigmar to back the project, and Shallya's cult to assist with personnel, I could reduce the cost to something manageable.\nMy plan was to make it mandatory for all children under fourteen. That way, I'd have a generation that was literate, disciplined, and trained from an early age. A ready labor force for the fields or the forge — and cannon fodder trained for my campaigns, should the day come.\nIt wouldn't be popular, I knew that. Rural parents send their children to work from age six or seven. That's two young hands to help plant, harvest, fetch water. Taking them away meant having to feed them without receiving the benefit of their labor. But with Sigmar's support, that would change. If the Cult said it was for the good of the Empire, then it became sacred word. No one would dare contradict them.\nMoreover, if Shallya cooperated by assigning priests to teach healing and helped with daily food distribution at the school, parents would see it differently — one less mouth to worry about.\nThe timing was perfect. The harvest was ending, and although beer and bread season was beginning, that was an adult's task. The children were available. I didn't have the building yet, but that didn't matter. I could build it from scratch. As long as I had teachers instructing in reading, it was a start. If I could also get them to train their bodies through games, even better.\nSo, calming my nerves, I entered the Sigmarite chapel, half-expecting that —being so close to the priest and inside his temple— he might notice I'm a wizard and try to burn me alive in the name of purity.\nBut nothing happened.\nUpon entering, I found several villagers praying silently, all kneeling before the altar. Some were begging for the god Sigmar's protection, others simply murmured memorized prayers. The priest, for his part, sat quietly on a bench, leafing through the Scriptures.\nWhen he saw me, he looked up, smiled, and approached warmly.\n\"Young baron… to what do we owe the honor of such a loyal servant of Sigmar gracing this humble chapel of the mighty Creator of the Empire?\" he said as he extended his hand with almost fatherly kindness.\nThe priest was quite old, but still held that firm gaze, full of determination — the mark of a true servant of the Empire's patron god.\n\"I wish I could say I came only seeking inspiration in a good book, to better serve Sigmar,\" I replied calmly, shaking his hand. \"But sadly, I come with a matter that concerns us both — myself as a noble, and you as the protector of this town's spirit.\"\n\"Of course, of course, young lord… there's always time for the purifying sword against beastmen,\" the priest said with a light chuckle, guiding me to a small room behind the altar.\nAs expected, even that room held a statue of Sigmar — depicted with his hammer raised in one hand and the head of a greenskin in the other, staring at me with inquisitive intensity, as if asking: Have you done your part?\n\"Tell me, young baron… how may I help you serve Sigmar in the best possible way?\" he asked seriously.\n\"Once again, Deus Sigmar has appeared to me in dreams,\" I began, using the same trick as always. \"This time, in the form of a blazing comet descending from the heavens. Sigmar showed me a building, one where the youth of Reinsfeld gathered to study. They learned to read, to write, to live as true Sigmarites… and they prepared to one day march to war against all that threatens the Empire.\"\n\"Another vision…?\" the priest murmured, then nodded solemnly. \"That only means you have remained on the right path, young baron. Sigmar speaks to you because your cause is just.\"\n\"And it is for that reason, noble servant of Sigmar, that I come to request the support of the Cult,\" I continued, my tone now firmer. \"I wish to build the very building Sigmar showed me. No one can teach the Empire's values better than the fervent servants of his faith.\"\nThe priest smiled with delight.\"I believe I can help you. I can personally teach some of the young ones what you're asking.\"\nI shook my head.\"In my vision, it was all the young ones, faithful servant. Something that neither your faith nor your will could achieve alone. There are too many — you couldn't teach them all…\"\nI paused for a moment, then continued\"That's why I want to bring in teachers from Altdorf and build a true center of learning in honor of Sigmar. For that, I need the formal support of the Cult. I need more priests capable of teaching, and the backing of the Sigmarite hierarchy. That way, we can follow the path Deus Sigmar has revealed to me,\" I said, as if the priest's fervor had rubbed off on me.\nThe priest clenched his fists. His eyes gleamed, as if a flame had lit within.\"You have my word, young baron. I will do everything in my power to ensure the Cult of Sigmar sends more servants to aid your cause. If Sigmar commanded you to build that school… then it shall be done. The will of Deus Sigmar will be fulfilled, no matter the cost,\" he declared, voice brimming with determination.\n\"Thank you… truly. I too will do everything within my power to make the vision Sigmar showed me a reality,\" I replied, bowing my head with calculated humility.\n\"And I will do my part by sending a letter to the local lector. With luck, it may even reach the Arch-Lector of Reikland. This mission must be followed closely and receive the full support of the Cult, young baron,\" affirmed the priest with such strong conviction that, for a moment, I almost felt guilty for manipulating him.\n\"Thank you, priest. If you'll allow me, I'll speak to my architect to see what can be done in the meantime. I'll personally send envoys to Altdorf to bring qualified teachers for this task. It won't be easy… it will be long and tedious. But the fruits will be sweet when Sigmar sees that we have followed the path He revealed to us,\" I said with false fervor, imitating the tone of those traveling preachers who stirred the people so easily.\nI turned and walked out of the chapel with firm steps. The time for action had come.\nI went straight to see Otto.\nUpon reaching the northern part of the village, I found him in the thick of it, reviewing blueprints and shouting orders amid the sound of hammers, saws, and wheelbarrows. He was overseeing the construction of new homes and the expansion of the sewage system in that area.\nWith hundreds of workers focused exclusively on housing, the progress was impressive. Otto had set up an efficient chain of labor: each group of workers performed a single task repeatedly until they mastered it. Thanks to that, his crew of eight hundred men could build nearly twenty houses per week.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nAnd with everything well organized — materials, tools, shifts — progress was fast. Even so, the constant influx of migrants was putting Otto under serious pressure.\n\"Careful, you idiot! Don't fall! Secure yourself with the rope before placing the tiles!\" Otto shouted at one of his men working on the roof of a nearly finished house.\nHe heard me approaching — clearly from the noise of all the metal I carry — and turned.\n\"Baron…\" he said, wiping sweat from his brow. \"Everything is going according to plan. Repairs on the damaged houses are already done. If you have nothing to add, I'd appreciate not being distracted,\" he added while going back to his plans.\n\"No, I have another important contract for you, Otto. A big one. One that will require your full attention,\" I said, noting how overwhelmed he looked from managing so many constructions at once.\n\"Of course, Baron… Is it something quick, like another workshop? Or do I need to draw up plans from scratch?—HEY, IDIOT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! THE DOOR GOES THERE, DON'T LAY BRICKS!\" he roared like a beast after seeing one of the workers build a room with no entrance.\n\"Wouldn't it be better to hire another architect to work under your command?\" I asked, eyeing his overload with some skepticism.\n\"I can't afford that… Long-term projects with a noble who has money are rare, and there's a lot of competition. I can't suddenly expand my workforce just to be let go later and have to fire them all,\" Otto replied, pulling out some blank blueprints.\n\"It's something that needs to be planned from scratch. So no, it's not quick or easy… I need you to build something similar to the Altdorf College of Engineering,\" I said with a smile.\nOtto turned instantly, eyes wide.\"Uh… now that is an interesting project… But it'll be expensive… And as you know, I'm nearly collapsing under the pace you demand for the housing. I don't have time to dedicate myself fully to something like that… I can ask for the plans if you like, I think they're still at my alma mater… but I don't have time to supervise,\" he said, clearly nervous.\n\"Then I'll hire another architect. It's not like—\" I tried to say.\n\"None of that,\" Otto interrupted with a firm tone. \"That contract is mine. Damn it… Give me five days and I'll find someone to replace me here. I'll send someone by boat to Altdorf to fetch the plans. But the construction of that building is entirely mine,\" he said, rubbing his temples.\n\"How much will the project cost me?\" I asked.\n\"I need to calculate how many months of work it'll take. We have the materials… I'll give you a price next week. Does that work for you?\" Otto replied, thinking.\n\"Of course. I'll handle determining the size,\" I said, pleased.\n\"Is it okay if I hire more people?\" he asked cautiously.\n\"Of course… The harvest's done — they'll be fighting for your jobs,\" I replied sincerely.\n\"Good, then we'll do that, so… HEY!! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!\" he roared again.\nI saw the plan was already underway.So, I stepped away.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Although they weren't particularly enthusiastic about the idea of teaching young people to fight, they were excited about the prospect of everyone learning basic wound care and healing techniques, as well as recognizing medicinal plants and processing them into tonics and remedies. That, they found inspiring. I proposed that their priests could teach as much as they wanted about healing, as long as they supported the project with either personnel or funds.\nThe leading priestess of the local cult, without hesitation, sent letters to Altdorf. Some time later, we received formal approval.\nAfter the five days Otto had mentioned, a construction crew arrived, made up of minor architects he had hired. I wanted to take advantage of the winter to launch every possible building project and, at the same time, provide work for my people during those difficult months.\nDuring that same period, several priests of Sigmar arrived as well, including none other than the Arch Lector of Reikland. Fortunately, I was out patrolling the roads after a report of bandits, so his visit—brief and without pomp—went largely unnoticed. I only learned of it because he had left me an invitation to visit him in Altdorf, intending to reward me for my actions over the past few months. According to my men, far from being offended by my absence, the Arch Lector was quite pleased to hear that I was fulfilling my duties as a noble in service to the Empire.\nEven if they offered me all the gold in the world, I wouldn't set foot in the heart of Sigmarite faith—but it's good to know they think highly of me. Apparently, my \"visions\" have been deemed genuine by both the local priest and the regional lector. So I have the support of the lower ranks… and now the higher ones too.\nThe real surprise was discovering that the priest of Sigmar in my town had been promoted to Lector. The cult had negotiated directly with the Emperor for Reinsfeld to cease being just a village and officially attain city status. This brought with it several rights:\nThe right to establish official markets. The right to erect its own wall. The right to form an urban militia. Authorization to found guilds… although I saw that last one more as a punishment. Frankly, I don't need guilds trying to use their control over production to force privileges.\nBut the most important of all was the right to self-govern. From now on, I had full freedom to create or abolish taxes at will, without needing permission from the Elector Count. If I wanted to lower tax rates to attract more trade, it was entirely up to me. And no one could object.\nI thanked the Cult of Sigmar wholeheartedly for all of this. But the best part was that they didn't stop at words. They sent material donations to the project: twenty young priests, freshly out of training—who wouldn't detect a magical signal even if it struck them in the face—and nearly five thousand crowns in direct contributions. They were also considering building a larger temple to house all the new priests.\nI had gained much more than I imagined from the simple act of asking a favor from an old priest…Sorry—Lector. Now, Lector of the City of Reinsfeld.\nNearly eight hundred of Otto's men began mobilizing toward a relatively open area near the western road of Reinsfeld, quite close to my castle. The work to level the ground and connect that part of the city to the sewer system had already begun.\nMeanwhile, the minor architects were tasked only with supervising house construction, and another five hundred laborers joined the effort. The construction of the new building would cost approximately six thousand crowns, so with the Cult of Sigmar's donation of nearly five thousand, the project was practically covered. I was grateful for this, as I wouldn't have to bear the full cost myself.\nEach day I watched the worksite take shape rapidly. They marked the area, set down stakes, and began raising the foundations of a building meant to stand the test of time and house a great number of young Imperials.\nI waited for the harvest to officially end before making the public announcement that all children between six and fourteen years of age were now required to attend this school. As expected, the news caused unrest among some parents—they would lose their working-age children, who helped both at home and in the fields. Some would even lose several children to this new policy. But at least for now, with the harvest completed, the immediate need for child labor was minimal, which softened the blow for many families.\nWhen plowing season came, things would be different. That's why I planned to further expand the distribution of horses and heavy plows to all my peasants. With that, I hoped to reduce the dependence on child labor for the next agricultural cycle.\nIt was better to announce the good news little by little, at the most opportune moment, to improve public reception. Give them bread, and make them forget you're also the one who beat them with the stick.\nAs for Rutger… I had asked him to change the market where the pigment was being sold. His complaint was immediate. He had a buyer network already established in Altdorf, built over months of effort—even when he had nothing to offer them. Switching to Nuln didn't please him at all: the trip was longer, the travel time doubled, and there was no guarantee it would be equally profitable. There was even the possibility that not everything would sell.\nBut I needed to divert attention from the Gold College. If the gold wizards insisted on pressing the matter of the pigment, it was better to shift their gaze elsewhere. I also gave Rutger an additional task: if possible, to recruit apprentice blacksmiths in Nuln, as well as glassblowers interested in opening workshops in my territory. I also asked him to look for apprentices who might wish to be sponsored by a noble to settle here.\nWhile Hieronymus and I were working to prepare a significant quantity of pigment, the laboratory bell suddenly rang with urgency, breaking our focus. We were both manipulating the pigment using the Lore of Chamon.\n\"What's going on now? I thought your servants didn't bother you when you were working here,\" said Hieronymus as he manipulated several items in the laboratory using his magic.\n\"It must be important. I made it clear I don't like to be interrupted,\" I replied, removing the safety goggles and the activated charcoal cloth from my face as I watched the bell continue to ring insistently.\nI took off the rest of my safety gear and approached the lower door of the tower, where I kept my laboratory. I opened the steel hatch.\n\"What?\" I asked, annoyed, as I saw the eyes of the guard who wouldn't stop ringing the bell.\n\"My lord... one of our riders spotted a large force of heavily armed men heading toward us on the road. According to the scout, they carried no banners, but they were armed: halberds, longswords... greatswords.\"\n\"Shit,\" I muttered, beginning to grow nervous. \"Call all available men. We need to intercept them while they're still on the road. We can't wait.\"\nAs fast as I could, I began putting on all my combat gear, including the runic chainmail. Though it still fit a bit loosely, it wasn't like the first time I had worn it; I realized how much I had grown in the past few months.\nWhile putting on the armor, I noticed the breastplate was now a little tight. Without wasting time, I grabbed a steel ingot and, using my magical abilities, melted the armor, integrated the extra metal, and then reformed it to its original shape—this time larger. It fit my torso perfectly, snug like a second skin. A luxury unthinkable for any soldier: being able to reshape your armor daily, just by willing it.\nAs soon as I finished equipping myself, now fully used to the weight of the chainmail that once hung loose on me, I headed for the castle stables. There, I found my men-at-arms already prepared. We mounted up quickly, ready to face whoever was approaching. Everything pointed to the von Kesselheim not waiting—they wanted to strike first, fast and hard.\nI had to respond in kind: kill as many as possible with my magic, send a clear message that my generation would not be trifled with… and, if possible, wipe them out completely.\nWe left the castle, and nearly a thousand more men joined us—either nearby or off-duty at the time. We began marching directly toward the western road, organizing our formation as we moved.\nOnce we were far enough from the town, I activated my magic. I immediately sensed a large number of human presences approaching. Many wore armor, and nearly all carried swords, halberds, and crossbows. Some even bore massive greatswords.\nMost likely, it was a force sent by the von Kesselheim, funded with all the gold they still had left.\nI was already beginning to think about what spells I would use to kill them all without my own men realizing I was a magic user. We kept marching toward the group, tension building, until finally we came face to face.\nThey were led by men wielding greatswords. I was about to melt their armor onto their bodies, but seeing their hesitation as we approached—some even seemed nervous—I began to suspect I might have misjudged the situation.\nI rode out of formation on my horse and gave the comet salute with my fingers.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar,\" I said loudly.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, Baron,\" replied one of the greatsword-wielding men.\n\"May I ask why such a large armed force is standing at the gates of my city?\" I asked, carefully observing the contingent. Imperial soldiers. Veterans, judging by the scars.\n\"Did you not invite us, Baron?\" the greatsword replied in a calm tone. \"That's what our captain told us... that the son of the former captain of the Greatswords of Carroburg was willing to hire all the veterans from the state regiments who wanted to settle in his lands. And here we are. Seems like our arrival wasn't exactly well received... ha ha,\" he added with a broad grin, spreading his arms theatrically.Googlᴇ search ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"Oh… I see,\" I answered, swallowing my pride at having made a fool of myself. \"I thought you were political rivals. I apologize for the reception… How many are you?\"\n\"Ten from the Greatswords of Carroburg,\" the veteran answered. \"Roughly five hundred swordsmen, two hundred halberdiers, eight hundred spearmen, and four hundred crossbowmen. A few days ago, after the harvest ended, the Prince of Reikland—Emperor Luitpold—terminated our contract with the state regiments. Many of us who served honorably kept our weapons as part of retirement.\"\n\"I understand… I certainly left the invitation open for all of you to come to my lands. I didn't expect all of you to be discharged at once. Still, I'll be glad to receive you in my city. Although I wasn't planning to hire more soldiers until next year, I have a new post ready for you all,\" I said, riding closer.\n\"We're all ears, Baron,\" replied the greatsword, planting his weapon into the earth and leaning on it with one hand on the pommel.\n\"Clearly, you—the Greatswords of Carroburg—will serve as my personal guard. As for the rest, I'd like to incorporate them into the Reinsfeld militia. Recently, the city received imperial permission to organize a citizen militia, independent from my personal forces. I need a unit dedicated exclusively to Reinsfeld's defense. If you're interested… you're all hired as of now,\" I said with a smile.\nThe greatsword turned and looked at the rest of the group.\n\"See? Told you he'd work fast,\" he said with satisfaction. The group responded with smiles and nods.\n\"Then allow me to guide you back to the city, which will be your new home. I'll do everything in my power to ensure you have housing as soon as possible,\" I assured them with genuine enthusiasm. Being able to recruit so many veterans from the state regiments was an unexpected blessing.\n\"My lord Baron,\" said the veteran, catching my attention as we prepared to march. \"Our families stayed behind. We didn't want them to spend the winter in the snow while we built homes. Will there be any trouble when they arrive, after the thaw?\"\n\"Of course not. The more, the merrier,\" I replied with a sincere smile.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Suddenly, nearly two thousand people arrived in the city. Not a small number.\nAnd all of them promised to bring their families later. With the average fertility rate of these peasants, that means we could expect between seven to ten thousand more people next year. And that's not counting any new migrant groups.\nOtto was already working like a damned soul building the school. He was operating at the maximum capacity his crew could handle. Everything was organized—his work chain was precise and well-managed.\nThe other teams of architects, on the other hand, were building more slowly. Otto had his system running for a while now, but the new architects were just beginning to coordinate their laborers. And I couldn't be on top of everyone at the same time.\nI had to juggle things to accommodate so many people at once. I gave away some available houses, and I crammed many militiamen into the guard barracks, which usually weren't used because most guards slept in their own homes.\nI reorganized the spaces. From four hundred beds we went to nearly eight hundred, packing everything to the limit. I also used empty rooms in the castle that were previously occupied by servants or used for storage.\nEven so, despite all that effort, many ended up sleeping in tents. They came prepared… but that wasn't the idea.\nLikewise, the veteran guards from the state regiments who joined me were officially registered as Reinsfeld militia, not as part of my personal guard. My intention was for those militiamen to be fully and exclusively dedicated to protecting Reinsfeld, from both internal and external threats.\nMy personal forces —the original 1,500 men— would remain a mobile force, capable of launching attacks or movements independently without leaving the center of my power undefended.\nNow that Reinsfeld is a proper city, though still without walls, any enemy force that managed to break through my lines while I was out campaigning could cause terrible chaos. That's why building walls became a priority… although for that I need workers and architects. And, for now, several are already overworked.\nStill, I kept planning. I wanted to make the most of the winter, already felt in the cold winds, to continue improving my town.\nTo make matters worse, the builders sent by the Cult of Sigmar had arrived… and they came with grand ideas. They planned to rebuild the old chapel from scratch and erect an imposing temple, visible from every corner of the city.\nThey wanted it to be the tallest building in Reinsfeld—even taller than my own castle… which stands atop a hill.\nA rather bold statement.\nAnd I honestly hope they don't follow through with it, because how long will it take to build such a monstrosity in the middle of the city? It's only a matter of time before someone complains about not being able to approach the chapel to receive the blessing of the Empire's patron god.\nAs usual, I was inspecting my industries, especially the clothing production one. The first batches of mass production were rolling out: a lot of clothing made from soft linen was being produced in large quantities, with standardized pieces like shirts and trousers. Simple garments, workwear, and everyday clothing.\nI was disappointed to notice that when using my pigment to dye the clothes, they lost much of the concentration of the winds of Chamon they normally attracted. So, it wasn't as efficient as I had hoped. Still, I would probably earn a fair amount of prestige by having my troops dressed in such a rare and expensive dye.\nThis, however, allowed for greater standardization. My men could receive the same equipment repeatedly, produced by dozens of workers operating consistently, generating uniforms to clothe over three thousand soldiers. I also wanted to clearly distinguish the militia from my private army. Sooner rather than later, I would have to begin delegating responsibilities to a group of literate people, so I could focus on more important matters, like my research… or the search for a modern laboratory where I could produce what I needed to synthesize cordite.\nFor now, though, I had another urgent project in mind: a hospital, run by the priests of Shallya. I had recently learned that they were overwhelmed. The demographic explosion my city had undergone in such a short time was beginning to take its toll.\nAnd it was only a matter of time before a plague broke out.\nThe sewer system wasn't yet completed. While many houses protected from the cold, many settlers still wouldn't have shelter for the winter. And surely, they would seek refuge in public places. If any of them got sick, they would quickly infect the rest.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nStarting to plan a hospital wasn't a bad idea. The problem was that Otto wasn't in any condition to take on another project. I'd have to find another architect.\n\"My lord,\" said one of my new bodyguards. He wore a custom-made suit of armor, personally forged with my magic from the Lore of Metal. The protection fit him with a perfection impossible to achieve by conventional means.\n\"What is it?\" I asked, observing the seasoned veteran.\n\"One of the riders stationed at the scout posts has spotted a large group of dwarfs approaching along the main road. And, with all due respect, even if they are not heavily armed, dwarfs are very dangerous. They are fierce fighters,\" he explained with the seriousness befitting his duty.\n\"Yes, but I don't think they're here to cause trouble… In fact, I've been expecting this visit for quite some time. Although their timing is unfortunate, I'm supposed to travel south soon now,\" I replied as I stood and began to search for the relevant documents: the purchase order for runic armor and the imperial decree granting me rights over part of the Grey Mountains.\nWith the scrolls in hand, I mounted my horse and headed to the outskirts of the city. It didn't take long before I saw them a dwarfen delegation advancing with firm steps, dragging pack bulls and carts filled with crates and heavy tools.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, friends of the Empire,\" I greeted, raising my hand with the twin-tailed comet gesture, making sure they could see my runic bracelets.\nJust as it had happened before, the dwarfs frowned at the sight of my runic armor. A murmur rippled through their line until one of the few wearing runic armor stepped forward. He was young by dawi standards—his beard barely reached his chest. Still, he carried himself with dignity, and his authority was evident. His eyes went straight to my bracelets.\n\"Where did you get those?\" he asked suspiciously, pointing at them.\nI smiled calmly, reached inside my cloak, and revealed the runic chainmail. Then, I took out the parchment.\n\"From an umgdawi residing in Marienburg. I have the purchase order here… honorable dawi,\" I said, showing him the document written in Khazalid runes.\nI saw his eyes widen and his lips tighten as he read it.\n\"My apologies, umgi. I have no grievance with you,\" he said with a slight nod. \"If possible, I would like to speak with the lord of these lands. We have unfinished business.\"\n\"You're looking at him, honorable dawi,\" I replied with composure.\nI saw his jaw tighten. His fists too. His whole posture reflected shame at having mentally accused me of being a thief.\n\"Custodian…\" the dwarf murmured, stepping forward and extending his hands toward me.\nI dismounted. The dawi gave me the strongest handshake I had ever experienced. I almost felt my bones crack.\n\"Ugh… Albrecht von Reinsfeld. With whom do I have the honor?\" I asked, rubbing my left hand.\n\"Duran Snorrison, custodian. Thane of Clan Grundkaraz,\" he introduced himself.\n\"Ah… then you're the rightful heir to the fortress, the mountains, and the Dammaz Kron still held within,\" I said, feigning surprise.\n\"Indeed, custodian. We've undertaken a long journey to return to what was once our home. With the blessing of the Ancestors, today will be the great day when my clan returns to its roots,\" he said solemnly.\n\"I imagine, being so close, you'd like to set off for the fortress immediately, am I wrong?\" I asked with a smile.\n\"There's nothing I'd wish for more, custodian. Even if I must walk until nightfall, I want to see the walls of the place that was once my father's home, before the greenskins forced him to flee,\" he replied firmly.\n\"Then I hope it's not a problem that I guide you myself,\" I said, mounting my horse again.\n\"None at all, custodian. Nothing would honor me more,\" the thane replied.\nWithout another word, we crossed through Reinsfeld. I noticed the worried looks from the peasants—no doubt they thought this was yet another wave of migrants… though this time with longer beards and grimmer faces. Fortunately, we didn't stop. We kept advancing down the main road.\nOnly at the bridge did we pause briefly. Some dwarfs stopped to watch my blacksmiths working the steel. Several laughed at what they saw, murmuring among themselves. They clearly disliked the way we were using iron.\nWe continued across the river and followed the paved road we had completed weeks earlier. Thanks to that, the dwarven carts advanced without trouble on terrain that, with the autumn rains, would otherwise have been muddy had we not acted in time.\nUpon reaching the mining village, nearly a thousand men were extracting rock from a massive open-pit mine. Entire chunks of iron were being torn from the heart of the mountain.\nAnd once again, I sensed the dwarfs' discomfort. Judging by their faces, they didn't like that the umgi were using \"their iron.\"\nEven so, we continued forward, entering the tin mine that led to the entrance of the fortress.\nWithout much delay, I guided them through the main tunnel until we finally reached the first chamber, where one of my encampments was located. It was where the garrison tasked with guarding the area was stationed.\nThere were traces of ash on the ground. Clearly, they had recently burned some goblin bodies that had snuck into the complex. But that didn't matter. We had finally reached the place all the dwarfs had longed to return to for generations.\nThe hundreds of dwarfs quickly began unloading crates from their carts and entering through the main gate. While they organized themselves, I continued leading the thane where he needed to go.\nWe crossed the vast central hall, advancing until we reached the throne room. There, without stopping, I opened a side door and led the thane to the secret chamber. I stopped in front of the rune and pointed to it.\nThe dwarf examined it, approached in silence, and placed his palm on it. The doors opened with a deep rumble, revealing the interior: the tombs of his ancestors… and the Dammaz Kron.\nThe dwarf nearly ran toward the book. He embraced it with emotion, and without saying a word, began flipping through it with trembling fingers. He pulled a quill and inkwell from his pouch and began reading aloud solemnly, one word after another:\n\"Dammaz… dammaz… dammaz…\"\nAt last, he lifted his gaze, looked at me intently, and quickly wrote in a blank section of the book. He filled three entire pages before speaking again.\n\"Dawongi… I have no words to thank you for all you've done for my bloodline. I never thought I'd be the one to reclaim my clan's Dammaz Kron. But here I am. From this day until the last of my line… and the last of my descendants… you are my friend. And friend of my clan, as are your children and your children's children,\" said the thane, his voice full of pride.\n\"I was merely doing my duty… helping our mountain friends,\" I replied calmly. \"I would have preferred to discuss this once you had settled in and begun rebuilding in peace, but I believe it's important to resolve it now—especially since I see your people are eager to resume mining activities as soon as possible.\"\nI took out a rolled parchment and unfurled it before him.\n\"We must reach an agreement on the mining rights. By order of Emperor Luitpold, with the approval of the ambassadors—and thus kings—of Karak Norn, Karaz-a-Karak, and Karak Azgaraz, it is recognized that all mineral wealth in the Grey Mountains, from Eilhart to the Wasteland, belongs to my family.\"\nThe dwarf nodded slowly. He didn't seem surprised.\n\"I know, dawongi. When news came that King Brokk Ironpick approved the decree, I felt great sorrow… Knowing it could mean never returning home, since it contradicts the will of the dwarven kings. To usurp the property of a human who received it by rightful decree is not something the dawi people condone.\"\n\"Your karak is still yours. That doesn't change,\" I replied. \"The only thing that changes is that the minerals are legally mine under Imperial law. But here is my offer, thane dawi: a treaty of friendship, protection, and cooperation.\"\nI leaned slightly toward him and continued:\n\"I offer to share my mining rights with your clan. Moreover, I pledge to help protect your karak and assist in reclaiming other fortresses that may be in greenskin hands. Your enemies will be my enemies. I will make available everything my lands can offer to restore your lineage's ancient glory.\"\nI paused, placing the decree on the table between us.\n\"In return, I want a trade agreement between my family and your clan, permission to hire some of your craftsmen for my projects, and ten percent of the ore your clan extracts.\"\nThe dwarf didn't respond immediately. He looked at the ceiling as if listening to something. Then closed his eyes briefly and nodded.\n\"Of course, dawongi. It's a very generous offer on your part. May this pact between me, Duran Snorrison, thane of Clan Grundkaraz, and the friend of our clan, Albrecht von Reinsfeld, last forever between our lines.\"\nThe dwarf took the Dammaz Kron in his hands and closed it solemnly.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

They placed long wooden tables and two bronze thrones. Little by little, the dwarfs —and dwarf women— began to sit down, as the dwarven ale started to flow.\nDuran urged me to sit on the other bronze throne, and they began to celebrate like I had never seen before. They shouted in Khazalid and toasted to having returned home.\nSoon, plates of freshly prepared food began to arrive. There were sausages and plenty of meat, though I couldn't identify where it came from. The dwarfs ate like the damned, and Duran was no exception. It was strange to see a dwarf smile — even stranger to see hundreds of them celebrating together.\n\"Come on, dawongi… don't be shy. This is in your honor. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for you,\" said Duran, offering me a platter of sausages and cheeses.\n\"Thank you,\" I replied. I watched as everyone ate with their hands, except in a few cases where they used forks and knives to cut large pieces of meat. I decided to follow their example. I picked up a sausage and some cheese.\nI brought the sausage to my mouth… and without exaggeration, it was the best thing I had ever eaten. Unlike noble food, which drowns everything in spices, this was perfectly seasoned to highlight the natural flavors. Tender, juicy — simply perfect.\n\"Buah…\" I exhaled as I chewed. It was impossible to hide how good it was.\nThe cheese had a spectacular flavor, but it was very hard. It actually hurt to bite into it — though that wasn't a problem for the powerful jaws of the dwarfs, who devoured it with ease.\nMy hands were covered in sausage juice, and I was looking for something to wipe them with when six dwarfs brought in a massive bronze tray. On it were roasted racks of ribs. The clan leader picked the biggest and fattest ones, split them, and shared a portion with me. Afterwards, the tray was passed down to the rest of the dwarfs.\nI kept eating until I was full. The food kept coming. That's when they served me a huge tankard of dwarven ale. All the dwarfs stared at me.\n\"Here, dawongi… the best ale you'll ever taste. Far better than any other umgi's,\" said Duran, handing me the tankard.\n\"Duran, my friend… I hope this isn't offensive, but I'm afraid I must decline your generous offer. By your standards, I'm a fragile umgi. Drinking alcohol —any alcohol— could damage me in ways that might haunt me in the future. I must remain healthy… I am the last of my bloodline. I know many umgi would kill for this opportunity, but I do it for my health, and for the sake of my lineage,\" I said, lowering my head slightly. I had suffered the consequences of alcohol before. I had no desire to experience anything like cirrhosis at the age of twelve\nDuran nodded, took the tankard, and passed it to one of his men, who drank it all in one gulp.\n\"I didn't know you were the last of your line… what happened?\" asked Duran, more seriously now.\n\"Wars… we've had a long conflict with a noble house of the Empire. We've fought for control of my lands for nearly five human generations. My uncles and cousins died in the last war… and I suspect my father was murdered,\" I replied.\nSilence took over the hall for a moment.\n\"Give me their names. Those names will go in the book,\" said Duran, his face twisted in fury.\n\"I only know they're the Kesselheims. But there's no need for you to intervene, my friends. You have your own problems, and this matter of mine is minor. Something I'll resolve on my own. No need to dirty your hands with those cowards,\" I said, lowering my tone to calm the situation.\nI didn't want a group of angry dwarfs marching to burn Altdorf just to avenge my grievances.\n\"I understand… dawongi, if that is your wish, I will not intervene. But if at any point you need our assistance, don't hesitate to ask,\" Duran replied, placing his hand on his chest.\n\"There is indeed something I'd like you to do for me specifically, but I think this should be discussed in private, considering it's a family secret… something that, if it works, could make both of us very rich,\" I said.\nThe dawi spoke in Khazalid, stood up, and gestured for me to follow him into a room that was empty, with just a few bare tables behind the grand hall.\n\"All right, dawongi… what's this secret deal you want to make that could fill the empty coffers of my clan?\" said the dwarf with complete sincerity.\n\"I'm telling you this in full confidence, my mountain friend. My trade is alchemy. Within the Empire, I doubt anyone is better at it than me — but among the dawi, I might just be a decent alchemist. The problem is that I don't have a proper laboratory. I have pieces crafted by a runesmith — the same one who made my armor — but I need a large, spacious lab where I can produce in large quantities, and more importantly, that's easy to defend from political enemies… and safe in case of an accidental explosion,\" I said while pulling out one of the paper cartridges containing smokeless powder.\nDuran didn't speak; he simply kept running his hand through his beard in silence while he listened to me.\n\"This is one of my best creations… but not perfect…\" I said, opening the paper cartridge and letting the smokeless powder fall. \"This is nitrocellulose, or smokeless powder. I need a better lab to make my cordite, which is a mix of this and another material, and then I'd have the most powerful, stable powder — and one that doesn't produce smoke.\"\nI saw Duran's mouth fall open.\n\"You're telling me you created something that even the best dwarven alchemists have tried to improve for millennia… on your own?\" said the thane, visibly skeptical.\n\"That's right, look,\" I said, pulling out a flint and a piece of rough metal, striking them to make a spark that ignited the powder. It flashed but burned away quickly, producing no smoke at all.\n\"Morgrim would be proud of this creation,\" said Duran.\n\"Not yet… it's not perfect… it's not stable. It's dangerous if not used correctly. My armies use it, but I want something even more stable, something that can be used safely. And that's where you come in. If you help me with the laboratory, I'll teach you the secret of its production, and we'll be partners in the sale. You'll sell it in the dawi market, and I'll sell it in the Imperial market. Obviously, as the creator and developer of the formula, you'll have to give me the larger share of the pie, since I was the one who nearly blew myself up making it, ha ha,\" I said as I put away the flint.\n\"We'll be the ones providing the workers for your laboratory?\" asked the thane, very interested.\n\"Yes, but my laboratory will also produce other things, so I would recommend that you build your own later on. If we manage to sell the powder at good prices, we'll become the sole producers of the finest powder available, which will bring huge profits to both of us. You'll fill your empty coffers, and I'll have funds to keep feeding my armies… and, of course, to help you fight the greenskins and wipe out the rats of House Kesselheim,\" I said, standing tall and placing my hands on my hips.\n\"I'm interested. The tin mines, though honest work, won't help fill my vaults if I need to defend my Karak. But… how much would the clan get for the work we'll be doing?\" asked the dawi thane.\n\"I was thinking of a 70/30 split of the total profits. I'll handle acquiring the materials, since many have to come via sea routes that may be hard to secure. Some ingredients come from Araby. For now, I have a plan to produce some of the raw materials I need in Reinsfeld, but that will be for next year. For now, all our focus must be on my laboratory,\" I said, extending my hand.\n\"So we just provide the workers and our engineers, eh… seems like a generous deal on your part, dawongi,\" said Duran, shaking my hand as strongly as before.\nI endured it, feeling like my hand was about to break, and then we returned to the great hall, where the dwarfs were still eating and celebrating.\nDuran began calling various members of his clan, ranging from bronze-bearded dwarfs to elders with long white beards, who started speaking in Khazalid beside me, as if they were discussing important matters.\nAs the ceremony went on, part of the food table in front of us was cleared, and Duran disappeared for a few minutes until he returned carrying the Dammaz Kron. Then he began speaking loudly in Khazalid. I understood almost nothing, only a few words from the dawi lexicon like umgi, dawi, dammaz… words that repeated very quickly.\nMeanwhile, Duran held the book open before all members of the clan and began reading each line of the grievances. When he read a line and the dwarfs looked angry, it seemed to be an unresolved grievance that they would have to deal with soon. When he read a line and the dwarfs cheered, Duran would cross it out with a reddish ink.\nThis continued for quite a while, going through every page of the Dammaz Kron.\nWhen they finished, beer was served again, and the dwarfs kept drinking.Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nThis went on for what seemed like two hours — just watching dwarfs get drunk, at the height of joy for having returned to their ancestral home and, more importantly, for striking grievances from the Dammaz Kron.\nWhen everything finally seemed to be winding down and the dwarfs returned to their usual tasks, I met again with the clan's thane, but this time with several dwarfs who began asking me what exactly I wanted for my laboratory.\n\"Dawongi, our thane told us about the contract you reached… that you would teach us about smokeless powder,\" said a dwarf who looked like an engineer. \"But in return, you want us to build something for you. I need to know exactly what it is you're asking for,\" he said, crossing his arms.\n\"Look, I need something around 500 square meters… here's what one meter looks like exactly, and a square meter is one meter long by one meter wide, with ten meters of height, all underground.\nI want it built at the entrance of the tin mine. That'll be the base structure, and around it, I want you to build a fortress. I'll leave that design entirely up to your expertise, but within the space I'm specifying, I need you to divide the wings as follows…\" I began to carefully list everything I needed to produce gunpowder on a large scale, as well as pigments.\nThe engineer took the rod measuring exactly one meter and a rope of one hundred meters with a knot every meter, and began writing things down as he listened to my instructions.\n\"As for the runes…\" said another dwarf, who looked incredibly muscular. \"What do you need on your tools?\"\n\"I need them to be resistant to temperature changes or violent chemical reactions, protection from corrosion… and I need the following runes with these specifications—\" I once again began explaining everything required to safely produce gunpowder at scale, and what was needed to manufacture nitroglycerin without being blown to bits.\nAnd so I spent several hours speaking with the dwarfs, explaining everything I needed. Once it was all discussed, Duran returned with a contract written partly in dwarven runes and partly in Reikspiel, containing everything we had agreed upon.\nHe signed it with a rune, and I signed it by writing my name in the most elegant manner I could.\nThe pact that would make me rich and powerful… and that would do the same for the dwarfs.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

For years, I had resigned myself to the thought that we would never again set foot in our ancestral halls, that what was lost would remain only in the echoes of the past. Aye, the clan lived on, but we did not live as dawi—we scraped by as refugees in Karak Norn, taking whatever work was offered just to survive, too few in number to dream of reclaiming what was ours. I had always believed it would fall to my descendants, if any, to take up that task.\nBut then came the news. Glorious news. The karak had been cleansed. Grobi dead, tunnels cleared. I did not care that the mining rights to our own mountains now belonged to the umgi who had led the retaking. When they told me he'd found the Dammaz Kron of my family line, I feared the worst—that it had been defiled by foul goblins or plundered by human hands. But no. I was told the Custodian had guarded it well, kept it sealed and watched, and that he was asking for us to come and claim what was ours by blood-right.\nWe gathered the longbeards of the clan. There was no hesitation. Every coin we had saved for the future was spent on tools, beasts, and provisions. Nothing was spared. We gathered every dawi—from the youngest to the oldest bent by the weight of years—and left Karak Norn. We gave our thanks to King Brokk Ironpick and Queen Thurma, and we offered prayers to their ancestors for sheltering us in our darkest hour. Thus began our journey home, through the roads of the umgi.\nOn the road, I swore that some of the umgi merchants we encountered would be named in my Dammaz Kron: scum who sold us faulty wares or kept copper coins from change. In every village there was at least one who thought they could cheat a dawi—as if they didn't know an offense to a dawi is a debt for life.\nNear the lands of the Imperial noble, a group of riders met us. Among them, a young umgi whelp watched us with curious eyes. He gave the usual \"Blessings of Sigmar\" greeting, but what froze me where I stood was the sight of him wearing… a runed armour! A human whelp, wearing dwarfen runes. Unthinkable. I could not stop myself—I asked where he'd got it, fearing the worst… that he had taken it from our lost halls.\nBut my shame was great. Not only had he been given the armour lawfully by one of our own, but that pup… that umgi… he was the very Custodian of our karak. The one to whom I owed my right to return. I had nearly called him a thief on his own ground. And yet, he took no offense. He dismounted and welcomed us with respect. He led us through his lands, escorted us to the gates of the karak, stopping only to cross a stone bridge, while some of our smiths scoffed at the human forges nearby. We knew well—umgi forges have neither the craft nor the patience of a dawi. For them, a suit of armour is a toy. For us, it is our name and honour.\nWhen we reached a nearby mining town, many among us remembered bitterly that we had lost the right to mine these mountains, and that we might have to labour under the umgi . But that mattered little now.\nWhen I stepped into the tunnels of the karak… when I walked again the halls my ancestors carved with stone and sweat… a deep joy passed through my beard. In the sealed hall, where the bones of my forebears lay, I saw it: the Dammaz Kron. Untouched.\nI could not resist. I opened the book and began to write. One by one, I listed the names of those who had wronged us on the road. Lying merchants, dishonourable umgi… Each stroke of the quill filled me with a satisfaction I cannot explain. At last. Justice.\nNow, nothing else matters. If I must work human mines or sell my forge to feed the clan, so be it. I have fulfilled my duty. I have returned. My ancestors rest in peace, and the clan has a home. There are more holds yet to reclaim, aye… but now we do not begin from nothing. Now, we begin as dawi.\nIt was all thanks to him… I owed him a debt without end… to my Dawongi. I declared, without hesitation, that he was a friend of our clan. A title not given lightly. But his deeds were so honourable, his conduct so just, that there could be no doubt.\nI expected nothing more from him, and yet… my Dawongi proved more worthy and honourable than many dawi I have known in my short life. He offered to share his property, to open his mining rights to us, in exchange for collaboration. He even spoke of giving us military aid to reclaim more lost karaks. Once again, he offered his hand so we would not have to bear the shame of working in umgi forges… but could earn our living as our ancestors did: drawing wealth from the stone with our own hands.\nI could not refuse such an offer. When I closed my eyes, I heard the voices of my ancestors whisper: \"Do it.\" It was their will. And a dawi does not ignore the will of his ancestors.\nI accepted,. The celebration had to begin, and my Dawongi had to be at the heart of it. I did not care if we spent what little we had—he had to be honoured as he deserved.\nI felt great joy seeing him dine with us, and more still to see him truly enjoy dawi cooking, as if he'd been born among us. No one was pretending—it was genuine. He truly appreciated our food.\nBut who would have thought such a just and noble umgi would have enemies? Other umgi had wronged him deeply. His whole family… dead. The last of his line. Alone in the world. Surrounded by cruel, greedy umgi without honour. It made my blood boil.\nI offered him my aid, but he refused. He wanted to be the one to settle those debts, to cleanse with his own hands the wrongs done to his kin. And I was not about to deny him that right—for it is an ancestral duty to avenge one's own.\nHe asked to speak in private. Strange, but I agreed.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nWith a pride worthy of a longbeard, my Dawongi told me he was an alchemist. He even dared compare himself to some of our own. As much as I respect him… I thought he was boasting. But he silenced that thought with the same firmness he showed this day I nearly called him a thief.\nHe showed me his version of black powder… smokeless. I've heard many of my cousins grumble about the soot, about scrubbing barrels after every shot of an arquebus… and the moment I saw it, I knew—this was a solution.\nOnce more, he proved why he is our friend. He could've kept it secret, sold it only to his folk, waited generations before trusting us with it. But he didn't. He wanted the dawi to be the ones to bring it into the world. For us to hammer it, test it, and sell it. Not the umgi. Us.\nBut i wanted to say no. Not out of disdain, but fear. What if it failed? What if my clan was shamed? But before I opened my mouth… I remembered our coffers. Empty. Bone dry. And if I ever hoped to restore my clan's old glory… I needed gold. Without gold, there's no hope. And there it was—right in front of me—the chance.\nI didn't even consult the longbeards. I accepted. It was the light at the end of the tunnel. Our best chance.\nOnce back in the main hall, I gathered the longbeards and told them what I had done. Some were angered that I had acted alone, said I was still young and should've waited. But I told them what I had seen.\nOne of them, a master weaponsmith, was the first to show interest. He demanded to see the powder with his own eyes. I'll get him another sample. He wants to test it himself.\nOur runesmith opposed it with force. He said something so revolutionary could bring imbalance more than benefit. But even he understood: if we are to see our clan shine again… we must take risks.\nTruth is, we already had.\nWe began the ceremony as our ancestors decreed: reviewing one by one the grievances recorded in the Dammaz Kron. Those fulfilled were solemnly struck through, and those still outstanding were read aloud, so they are not forgotten. Every name, every debt, every insult was treated with the respect it deserves. That is how dawi keep memory alive. That is how justice is done.\nAfter the celebration, we gathered with the Dawongi of the clan. He spoke with clarity and precision about what he needed. He was no charlatan, no eager apprentice. He was a true master of his craft. Both our runesmith and our clan engineer were left speechless listening to him. The Dawongi spoke with such depth, such understanding of his art, it was as though he'd been born in our forges. He knew every concept, every technical detail needed to bring this smokeless powder to life.\nWhen he withdrew to rest, we spoke among the longbeards. And all of us, even the doubters, admitted we had done right to honour him. His words showed not only knowledge, but vision. A vision that could give us back what we once thought lost.\nNever, in all my decades, have we been this close to reclaiming the glory of our clan. For the first time in many long years… I felt pride. Pride to still be alive to see the beginning of the return. Pride that maybe I, with these old eyes, will live to see the restoration of every fallen karak. One by one. Stone by stone.\nAnd may the ancestors bear witness.",

They were, without a doubt, the best thing that could have happened to me. Since it was already night, I found myself resting in a room they had permanently assigned to me for whenever I wished to visit them. Upon my departure, they gifted me a runic sword engraved with minor runes—one of the many swords stored in the vault—but they gave it to me, to my dynasty, as a gift for everything I had done. Not even under the usual condition of returning it upon death, which was fairly common for runic weapons or armor granted within the Empire.\nAs I exited the mine tunnels, I saw nearly a hundred dwarven workers extracting rock, leveling the area, and expanding the flat ground for the laboratory's construction at a speed that was simply unnatural. That's why befriending the dwarfs was worth it: access to the best qualified labor force one could find. Even the most \"useless\" dwarf was a master in some craft, capable of doing it several times better than any human. The only difference was the time they took to create a piece—what would take a human a few days, they would spend weeks on, seeking perfection.\nBut it didn't matter. I now had a laboratory under construction—and the best part: for free. I didn't have to invest anything in expensive construction teams, or pay them for silence, or silence them by force. The place would remain secret, as no one was allowed to negotiate with the clan except me. No one was to approach the tunnel entrance; only dwarfs could freely come and go.\nAs the days went by, everything moved quickly—mainly because I was enjoying a peace I had almost forgotten existed. Migrants had stopped arriving. Winter had come, significantly reducing the flow. Anyone arriving now was from Reikland, which eased the burden on my architects, who were working at maximum capacity to house everyone, since many still lacked homes of their own.\nOn the other hand, as the weeks passed swiftly, Otto had finally raised enough walls of the school to begin teaching the youngest ones. With the help of the Cult of Shallya, we provided hot meals to all the imperial youth attending the first classes, which mostly focused on reading books brought by the many priests of Sigmar.\nAbout the greatness of Sigmar, the greatness of the Empire, and the role Sigmar expected of them in the future. Simple stuff, but it reinforced the Sigmarite creed. And even though the school was far from what I envisioned for this place, I was pleased that nearly a thousand young people showed up to several classrooms—a number that would only grow as more parts of the school were finished.\nWith that progressing well, things were even quieter in Reinsfeld. Everyone stayed inside their homes; few people ventured out as winter held firm. Most of the economy now took place indoors, where families spent time weaving or preserving food, which left the streets rather empty. Only the merchants from Marienburg and other imperial cities passed through the area, looking to buy goods to sell at the end of their trade routes.\nRutger, it seemed, had finally found buyers in Nuln. It was more difficult to do business in that city—even though it was important, much of its economy was focused on the forges rather than the nobility. But he finally managed to establish contacts to sell in Nuln, using his Marienburger \"magic\" and tricking people until he got the desired outcome.\nNow he had a network of buyers in Nuln—not as profitable, and the turnaround time had doubled, but well… nothing I could do. I didn't want wizards bothering me, to be honest.\nFrom time to time, I visited the dwarfs' progress in the mountains. It was clear they were advancing rapidly. Often I brought carts loaded with supplies, as much of the work to rebuild their underground farms depended on materials that were still scarce. I made sure they lacked nothing, so they could focus entirely on building my laboratory. And honestly, it was coming along very well.\nDays passed and I never stopped working. I maintained a constant rhythm, making sure everything was in order. I especially handled Rutger's requests—he had managed to convince a few artisans from Nuln to move to my city. In exchange, they demanded workshops near the market, especially the glassblowers. i wanted greenhouses as soon as possible to grow food… and cotton, if possible.\nBut as the days advanced, one finally came that most people fear: Witching Night. It marked the year's end, and the town's atmosphere changed completely. I quickly learned why. According to Reinsfeld's lector, it was common for cultists to roam more freely on that night. For that reason, most citizens preferred to lock themselves in their homes. Only the bravest—or those faithful to Morr—dared to go out.\nAt the start of the day, I simply went out with a few priests of Shallya. We passed through several known homes, asking if they needed anything, delivering food directly to the neediest. The priests knew well who was suffering, so finding them was easy. But as soon as they finished, they locked themselves in their temples, waiting for the day to pass.\nAlmost the entire town fell silent. Merchants holed up in the taverns. Farmers slept in their homes. Thankfully, all the settlers now had housing, although the guards were still somewhat cramped in the barracks.\nI didn't like one bit that everyone refused to work. No builders, no soapmakers, no blacksmiths, no one who made paper or clothes. No one showed up for their posts. Only the guards fulfilled their duty, and even then, only in large groups.\nSeveral times they asked to leave early, to spend the rest of the day locked inside their homes. Since there was no sign of immediate human danger, I accepted. I let them return to their homes or barracks. I didn't want them nervous. Then, I walked through the empty city with my bodyguards, observing the houses marked with symbols of Sigmar and Morr. The Sigmarite chapel, still under construction, remained guarded by its warrior-priests, alert for any sign.\nI eventually decided to go to my laboratory. It would be a quiet day. It didn't matter much that I wasn't patrolling the town. I started working alongside Hieronymus, preparing more gunpowder to stockpile reserves. Several calm hours passed…\nUntil suddenly, a rancid smell hit my nose.\n\"Do you feel it?\" said Hieronymus, suddenly raising his head.\n\"Yes... a rotten sensation... like decayed metal. Reminds me of Marienburg,\" I replied, frowning.\n\"Something has entered your lands carrying an amulet linked to the Ruinous Powers. And considering the date... it's dangerous. It might be trying to attract daemons.\"\n\"Shit... have you ever seen one of these cases actually work?\" I asked tensely.\n\"Several. Many of those rituals fade at the end of the night, since the bond isn't strong enough to keep them anchored. But on this date... on this night... someone with a corrupted object is dangerous. If they manage to cause enough harm, the portal might remain open even after sunrise. It's best to act now.\"\n\"Scheiße... Scheiße... Scheiße...\" I muttered as I removed my protective gear.\n\"Go, my apprentice. I would only slow you down. Even going down the stairs takes me time now… I'll do what I can from here, but you must stop the ritual from being completed.\"\nI nodded without a word. I removed my apron, donned my armor, took the runic sword gifted to me by the dwarfs—one of the many that rested in their vault—and summoned all available men-at-arms. There was no time for full mobilization, but I needed a group ready and well-armed, even if small.\n\"Listen to me! Deus Sigmar has sent me an emergency warning! My brave men… cultists will try to draw the eyes of the Empire's enemies by taking advantage of this unholy day. I know you are afraid… but the city depends on us. We must stop them from succeeding, even if we must fall to do so!\" I shouted, my voice echoing across the castle courtyard.\nOnly a group of ten men joined me immediately. The rest were arming themselves, but they would not be ready in time.\nWe mounted our horses and rode at full gallop, though even the animals seemed to feel the weight of the night. Even my loyal mare was nervous, trying more than once to turn back on her own.\nWe followed the sensation. It was like a signal burning on my skin, drawing us toward the woods. My men rode in silence, but it was clear they were nervous. They looked in all directions, flinching at every sound, as if every crack of a branch was a threat.\nThe signal grew stronger, until we began to hear sounds. Something was moving among the trees. We dismounted. The forest was dense, and we did not want to give away our presence. We tied the horses, hoping they wouldn't flee.ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nWe moved on foot, swords drawn, sliding between the trunks. The silence was oppressive... until we found the source of the noise.\nI stopped when I saw the scene.\nOn a large rock, hastily carved, lay a person torn open. Around it, a group of humanoid figures was eating the entrails and drinking the blood of the sacrifice, laughing and chanting gutturally.\nBut they weren't only human. There were two… abominations. Androgynous figures, with deformed bodies: feminine traits on one half and a male torso on the other, with grotesque limbs. They had claws, crab-like pincers, and forked tongues that slowly slid along the necks of the cultists, who welcomed them with ecstasy and madness.\nThe creatures saw us and smiled.\nThey began to dance.\nThey caressed themselves with their claws, ran their tongues over their deformed bodies, lifted their lone breast, and made obscene movements with their hips. All with a perverse rhythm that seemed to resonate in the blood.\n\"By Sigmar... what beautiful women,\" one of my guards murmured, dropping his sword as he walked hypnotized toward them.\nIt didn't take long for me to realize that all my men were falling under the trance, their eyes lost, jaws slack, breathing heavily.\nThe damned dance continued.\nI jumped forward, shoving one of my soldiers away from the group. I couldn't let them fall.\nWith the runic sword in hand, I advanced. I ran toward one of the creatures, and before it could react, I struck with a brutal, precise slash aimed at the neck. The runic blade glowed faintly as it cut into the flesh.\nthe abominations scream as I severed its head with a single stroke. Its corrupted blood sprayed in all directions as the head rolled across the ground, leaving a bubbling purple trail through the grass.\nThe second abomination hissed furiously at the scene. It lunged at me with unrestrained violence, its claws reaching for my throat, trying to rip me apart in a repugnant frenzy.\nI thrust my blade to force it back, but it dodged with unnatural agility. In a blink, it tried to impale me with its pincers. I barely managed to block them, crossing the runic blade at the last second. The pincers clamped down hard around the blade, screeching like a hellish vice.\nThe creature tried to push me to the ground, opening the way to strike with its forked tongue. I immediately stopped resisting with my left arm, feigning weakness. The creature lost balance slightly, just enough for me to drive the pommel of the sword with all my right arm's strength directly into its face. One of the guards sank into its eye with a wet crunch.\nIt howled in pain. Reflexively, it released the sword and covered its ruined eye.\nI didn't waste time.\nI twisted the blade, still firm in my hands, and launched an upward slash. The creature's left leg separated from its body with a sound of torn flesh and shattered bone.\nIt fell to the ground, shrieking and writhing. Before it could counterattack, I launched a series of precise cuts, severing its arms one by one. I gave it no respite. When it was nothing more than a twitching torso full of smoldering stumps, I raised my sword once more and cut off its head.\nSilence fell like a slab of stone.\nMy men collapsed to the ground, covering their heads with their hands, eyes wide in horror. The trance had broken... but the horror remained.\nThe cultists, freed from the demonic influence, tried to flee. Humans deformed by corruption—if they could still be called that. They had horns, ulcerated skin, extra mouths... they were little more than beasts.\nI gave them no chance.\nMy sword found their backs and bellies without hesitation. One by one, they fell, squealing like trapped rats. There was no mercy for the mutant.\n\"Call the priest! I don't give a damn if this day is cursed... I want this place purified, NOW!\" I shouted, my voice still trembling, trying to calm the burning adrenaline inside me.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

But it's a good job—and above all, a well-paid one. You earn triple what any local guard makes. A blessing, considering what most stingy nobles usually offer, preferring to spend their coin on banquets rather than on decent men to protect them.\nOf course, good pay comes with sweat. Unlike other nobles who spend their days hunting or drunk and laughing in their halls, the baron likes to work. And I don't mean stamping a few papers and pretending to command. No. That damned boy—because he's still young, even if he doesn't look it—works like he's possessed. From the moment the sun peeks out, he's already giving orders, organizing rations for the poor, or talking to artisans. And there I am, behind him, watching that no bastard gets too close with ill intent.\nSame thing in the afternoon. He inspects construction works, argues with architects, reviews accounts. Sometimes it seems the architects speak to him begrudgingly, especially with how busy they look in their tasks.\nMy routine is to follow him all day: to meetings, to inspections, to his damned office where he combs through ledgers and production lists like his life depends on it. Whether it's checking if the shipment arrived, or if nails are missing, or if the furnace isn't smelting properly… I'm there, shadowing him, in case some idiot thinks he can stab him when no one's looking.\nThe only break in that routine is training. Blessed Sigmar, how that boy trains. Who could understand him? Only twelve summers and already taller than some grown men. Shoulders like a bull, solid arms, and a way of fighting with a sword that seems straight out of a tale. And those damned kicks… he landed one right in my thigh once, and I limped for two days. It's not normal. But it seems Sigmar favors him.\nFrom time to time, we go out on horseback patrols, clearing roads of bandits or visiting mining villages. Not much changes. Only in the evenings do we get some respite, when he shuts himself away with his financial advisor to figure out how to increase revenue—without raising taxes. Yes, without raising taxes. Even that he does differently.\nThe only real problem I see… is that he likes danger too much. He fears nothing. Throws himself into the front lines, gets into fights, puts himself in the middle when he should stay back. More than once I've stood with my sword drawn, defending him from bandits while he barked orders at the soldiers like nothing was happening. One day, he's going to get himself killed if he doesn't watch it.\nOther than that… he's a good lord. Harsh, demanding—but fair. One of the few you'd risk your skin for without much hesitation.\nThe bastard wasn't even afraid of Hexenstag. While everyone else locked themselves in, blessed their doors, and avoided even peeking out the windows, he went about the day like any other. Distributing food, checking warehouses, speaking with foremen… he even wanted us to continue working as if nothing were wrong. Not a hint of fear in his eyes. If we hadn't begged him to at least let us protect him from within the castle walls, he probably would've gone out patrolling like a madman.\nThankfully, he listened. We returned to the keep, shut the gates, lit the torches, and had some beer to calm our nerves. I thought I'd finally get to take off my armor and sleep a bit.\nBut no. Just as I was loosening my doublet, the baron showed up. Armed to the teeth. Sword at his belt, face tense.\nHe said he had a vision. That Sigmar had shown him a threat within the city and that we had to move immediately. I was one of the few idiots still in armor, so I had to go with him. My whole body was shaking as we stepped out into the cold under the moonlight. No sane man walks the roads that night—not even the bandits. But he walked with purpose. No hesitation. As if nothing could touch him.\nDealing with the horses was another story. They didn't want to move. Snorting, whinnying, refusing to go forward. Even they sensed something—a pressure in the air that chilled the bones. As we neared the spot the baron said his vision had led him to, the animals panicked. All of them bolted—except for the bastard's horse, the only one that didn't flee. The others tore off like they'd been stabbed.\nAfter a while, we reached a clearing. The moment we stepped into it, something changed. I felt a strange warmth, as if fear had vanished. The air smelled sweet—of flowers, of fine wine. And then we saw them.\nTwo women. The most beautiful I've ever seen. Voluptuous, with skin as smooth as ivory and hair so long it fell like veils over their bare shoulders. One was a redhead, her green eyes glowing like emeralds in the moonlight; the other, dark-haired, with full lips and a stunning smile. They wore robes as thin as smoke, barely hiding what lay beneath, and they laughed—softly, like they were caressing your soul with their voices.\nAnd then I saw the table. Long, covered in delicacies: roasted meats, goblets of wine, golden bread… and men. Sitting with them. Men from the town. One I swore I'd seen weeks ago in the plaza. They all ate, drank, and laughed as if nothing else mattered.\nOne of the women approached us slowly, moving with unreal grace. Her steps were light, her hips swaying in a slow, almost hypnotic rhythm. She placed her hands beneath her breasts, lifting them naturally to accentuate her figure, and smiled—a smile that seemed to promise every dream a man could have.\n\"Come now, don't be shy… join us,\" she said in a voice sweet as honey, slipping into the ears and straight to the heart.\n\"By Sigmar… such beautiful women…\" one of my companions murmured. He stepped forward, enchanted, as if under a spell.\nI almost followed. My whole body urged me to. There was warmth, an odd peace, a scent in the air that made me feel weightless.\nBut then… something moved.\nSomething moved—fast. Like lightning. It was the baron.\nWithout a word, he drew his runic sword and shoved the soldier in front of him. The man fell to the ground with a grunt, and the baron charged straight at the redhead without hesitation.\nI didn't even have time to shout for him to stop.\nThe blade gleamed in the moonlight, and in a single stroke, he took her head clean off.\nThe woman fell to her knees. She wept. Completely clear tears ran down her cheeks while her blood—thick and red—spilled into the grass. Her body collapsed in silence.\nThe other woman, the dark-haired one, lunged at the baron with a dry, furious shriek.\n\"Why did you do it?! Why did you kill them?!\" she screamed, her voice now harsh and broken, stripped of all sweetness. Her hands tried to wrench the sword from his grasp.\nThe baron stepped back, feigning weakness—then, with the strength of his right arm, smashed the pommel of his sword straight into her face.\nI heard the dull crack of metal on bone.\nOne of the quillons drove into her left eye.\nThe woman let out a piercing scream, clutching her face with both hands. Blood poured in streams from the ruined socket. In that instant, the baron struck again. With an upward slash, he severed her right leg at the thigh.\nShe fell to the ground howling like a beast. Even without a leg, she crawled with rage, trying to bite him.\nHe didn't hesitate. One slash to her left arm. Another to the right.\nAnd as she shrieked like a damned soul, the baron finished it—beheading her with a clean, brutal stroke.\nThe warmth vanished like someone had doused a fire. The sweet scent turned to a stench of rotten flesh. The table that once seemed laden with delicacies revealed its true nature: butchered human bodies, stacked limbs, gnawed bones, smiling faces swarming with flies.\n\"By Sigmar…\" I muttered, horrified.",

Two men burst in, gasping for air, covered in dust and sweat, but most of all, in a visceral fear—fear that doesn't come from battle, but from the touch of the unholy.\n\"Lector... Baron Albrecht requires your presence immediately. He found a group of heretics with... with... demons,\" one of them said, stumbling, as if repeating it alone filled him with shame and horror.\nI rose without hesitation. Around me, the other priests were waking from their makeshift beds, grabbing their hammers, rosaries, and holy books.\n\"What happened?\" I asked as I approached them, already surrounded by my temple brothers.\n\"The baron had another vision of Sigmar,\" explained the second soldier, his voice still shaky. \"He showed him Reinsfeld in danger... we rode immediately and... found a profane ritual, halfway completed...\"\n\"By Sigmar... did you manage to interrupt it?\" I asked, a knot in my chest.\nThe knight lowered his gaze. \"Yes... the baron...\" He paused, swallowed, but couldn't continue. It was his companion who spoke.\n\"We were weak. We fell to the seduction of those...\" He couldn't finish the sentence.\n\"Abominations,\" the other one completed with a bitter voice.\nI took a deep breath, closing my eyes for a moment. Corruption doesn't always come with claws and flames, but with sweet smiles and whispers that tempt the soul. I extended my hand and gave the order without hesitation.\n\"Take them to the penitence cells. Let them be watched day and night. If there's a mark of Chaos on their minds, it will be detected. If not... they will receive absolution in due time.\"\nThe men offered no resistance. They knew their weakness had put them under suspicion and accepted the penance with a resignation worthy of compassion.\n\"Where exactly did this happen?\" I asked firmly.\n\"The north, lector. You can't miss it,\" one of them replied before disappearing behind the stone walls with the priests.\nI took my hammer, gritted my teeth, and ran with the others toward the designated place. As we advanced, I channeled the power of our god, and like a divine beacon, I felt a repulsive stain beyond the forest, to the north. A spiritual stench, a shadow that the wind could not dissipate.\nWe found it.Google seaʀᴄh NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nA nervous horse, without a rider, kicked the ground as if it still smelled the evil. Further ahead, a group of armed men sat silently, their gazes fixed on the mud, carrying a shame that could not be wiped away with words.\nAnd in the center... was he. Baron Albrecht.\nCovered in dark blood that reeked of decay, wielding a runic sword still dripping the remnants of the horrors he had slain. His expression was not one of triumph.\n\"Baron... what happened?\" I asked, stopping before him.\n\"A ritual to summon demons. I arrived in time. If not, this would have been a Chaos nest.\" He kicked the head of a creature with deformed female features, now lifeless.\n\"Did your men participate?\" asked one of the priests beside me.\n\"No. They were victims of illusions, nothing more. They did not participate in the ritual by the grace of our lord Sigmar,\" the baron said.\n\"And you, baron? Did you resist?\" I asked directly.\n\"Resisting means fighting. I did not fight. It didn't affect me. From the very first moment, I saw what they were: monsters trying to imitate the beauty of human creation. Grotesque copies. Creatures with perfume and shape, but no soul. I felt not an ounce of desire. Only revulsion.\" He spat beside one of the dismembered bodies.\nHe pointed with his sword to the corpses of the cultists.\n\"They wore rings. Don't touch them. I'm sure they're cursed.\"\nI nodded. I took a step toward the bodies, channeling Sigmar's power, and confirmed it instantly: the rings vibrated with an unhealthy energy. They still pulsed with the essence of Chaos, as if waiting for a new host.\n\"Have them picked up with silver tongs and locked in boxes sealed with holy water. And no one, absolutely no one, is to use them,\" I ordered.\nI then turned toward the baron.\n\"This night, noble Albrecht, you have proven that your soul still burns with the light of the Comet. But your path is now doubly dangerous. Because if the servants of Chaos have marked you as an enemy... they will not be long in returning.\"\nThe rest of the baron's men were taken without resistance to the penitence cells. They would be watched for the coming days to see if they showed signs of corruption. One of them looked away as I passed by, not out of defiance, but out of shame. I felt compassion, but I showed no clemency. Corruption doesn't always leave visible scars.\nAs for Baron Albrecht... it was different.\nWe allowed him to return only after he had received prayers, blessings, and was sprinkled with holy water. We performed each of the detection rites. The scriptures were clear: no trace of corruption in him. Nothing. Not the slightest tremor in the consecrated fire, not a single discordant word in the litany. Even the sacred symbols, which often vibrated with rejection at the impure, remained serene. Pure.\nIt's impossible not to remember what has always been said of the Reinsfeld House.\nEach and every one of its members shares the physique of the Heldenhammer himself imposing height, bodies forged as if to wear armor from the cradle, gazes that inspire order and strength. But there's more. They are touched. Blessed. One after another, they have manifested gifts that cannot be explained without resorting to divine favor. For generations, the Reinsfeld barons have possessed the gift of spiritual scent the ability to detect the presence of mutants as if their stench rotted the very air.\nBut none, none have been so touched as Albrecht.\nThe visions of the Comet with two tails are frequent. Not simple dreams or illusions like those claimed by other nobles eager for recognition, but true revelations. And there's no record of a single one that has not come true.\nTonight he proved it again. The ritual was interrupted not by chance,but because Sigmar guided him, as he has done so many times. He protects him, no doubt.\nI remember perfectly the first time I saw him.\nHe was a young boy, barely out of his home, still walking poorly, and yet already carrying a gaze too severe for his age. He had the brow of the wise and the eyes of soldiers. I knew, from that day, that this young man was destined for something greater than the titles of his family. A pity he didn't join the clergy. He would have gone far... perhaps farther than even I could imagine. But his father had other plans. Like many nobles, he believed that service in the field was superior to Sigmar's direct service. What a mistake.\nWe finished the rites with my brother priests at dawn. We drove stakes with the Sigmar symbol into the earth still stained by demon blood. We sprinkled the ground with holy water and chanted purification litanies. The chants echoed through the trees and the echoes dispelled the last traces of the profane stench.\nThe earth was sealed. The danger, for now, contained.\nBut our work is not over.\ni send one of the priests to the chapel with clear instructions he must write an immediate message for the witch hunters.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

If that's the case, they will be executed,\" replied one of the hunters, staring at me.\n\"May I inquire about them? If they are indeed corrupted, I request that it be swift—that their throats be cut and then their bodies burned,\" I said, returning the stare to all present.\n\"You have my word, baron... A servant of Sigmar as respected as you wouldn't endanger himself by placing weak-willed men in his guard. Therefore, they must have been in the presence of a great amount of corruption to fall under the illusion of those demons,\" commented the hunter who seemed the most amicable of the group.\n\"But we need to know exactly what happened,\" intervened the one furthest away.\n\"What happened is that I had one of my visions from Sigmar… As always, a twin-tailed comet pointed to a place within my lands. I saw purple flames spreading toward Reinsfeld, burning everything in their path. Faced with that horrid vision, I armed a group of available men, though they were terrified by the night in which it occurred. We rode out and encountered those… grotesque things attempting to seduce my soldiers. According to them, they saw them as the most beautiful women in the world. I only saw horrors—beasts attempting to imitate the greatness of humanity in a corrupted form. I did what any good Sigmarite in my position would do: I cut off one of their heads and fought the other until it died. Then I killed every one of those mutants disguised as humans,\" I recounted, showing zeal before the group who, while interrogating me, had not yet treated me as a suspect.\n\"Did you see anything strange in your men, as if they were participating willingly?\" asked the first hunter.\n\"No… none. They were all under the strong spell of the demons, but never participated of their own free will. They came with the intent to kill anything they encountered,\" I responded firmly.\n\"That matches with a few of the testimonies from those we've interrogated,\" murmured the more cordial hunter.\n\"Well then… we've been here quite a while. Am I under investigation or may I take my leave?\" I asked, already annoyed after several hours of questioning, having endured every cheap trick witch hunters usually resort to. They are not creative, and after my past encounters with them, I already knew most of their traps.\n\"You are not under investigation, baron...\" said the leader of the group.\nI stood up immediately, but he raised his voice:\n\"But—\"\n\"But?\" I asked, turning to stare at him directly.\n\"It is vital that a witch hunter barracks be established in Reinsfeld. It is possible that more heretical agents are in the area, waiting for the right moment to strike. Given the strategic importance of this city, so close to a rebellious province, it is necessary for faithful servants of Sigmar to safeguard its borders,\" declared the leader.\n\"I'll take note. Goodbye,\" I said as I adjusted my garments and began walking toward the exit of the temple under construction.\n\"Baron… that was an order,\" the witch hunter said without turning around.\n\"An order?... An order from a witch hunter to a noble? A noble who shows no signs of corruption, without the authorization of the Grand Theogonist, and in violation of all laws enacted by Emperor Magnus the Pious to limit your order's power…\" I said without turning back, continuing toward the exit.\nAt the threshold, I encountered Reinsfeld's lector.\n\"All well, young baron?\" he asked with clear interest.\n\"Bah… these novice witch hunters. They think they have the power to make and unmake at will,\" I replied.\n\"What did they do?\" asked the lector, now visibly tired.\n\"They wanted me to fund the opening of a witch hunter barracks… and presented it as an order,\" I said, irritated.\nThe lector shook his head, disappointed.\n\"Many forget, in their zeal, that although they answer to the Cult of Sigmar, they cannot coerce nobles into obeying their will. That would go against the feudal contract established by our Holy Emperor Magnus,\" he replied.\n\"That's exactly what I said… I'm surprised that someone serving the Cult could forget something so basic. I still remember that it was one of the first things I read when I learned to read,\" I said, placing my hands on my hips.\n\"Yes, something basic… but I suppose they wanted to negotiate on their own,\" the lector said in a low voice.\n\"Negotiate what?\" I asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\"It's obvious. Reinsfeld is no longer a small village. It's a full-fledged city. And though the presence of the clergy of Sigmar is strong thanks to the construction of their school, my position, and the arrival of more priests… the Cult wants to formally establish a witch hunter barracks to ensure safety. A frontier city must have their presence. Heretics never stop trying to use the routes from the rebellious province to smuggle cursed objects. What happened here is proof of that,\" explained the lector.\n\"Ah, I see… so the hunters wanted to be the ones to take credit for convincing me,\" I muttered.\n\"Clearly. It was an order from the Arch Lector of Reikland. Before, it was just a recommendation, but given what has occurred, it became a necessity. And those hunters wanted to be the ones chosen as leaders of the new branch of the cult here. Being named Witch Hunter Captain of Reinsfeld would be a huge step forward in their careers. That's why they acted alone… even when I told them I would speak with you,\" the lector concluded, visibly irritated.\n\"Clearly, if it's a request from the Arch Lector of Reikland, it would be unwise to reject his kind consideration… especially given all the help the Cult has provided in the construction of my school. But I would like to place limits on the witch hunters. I don't want butchers,\" I said, folding my arms.\nThe lector frowned.\n\"Witch hunters are not butchers, young baron. They are servants of Sigmar, just as I am,\" he replied firmly.\n\"Lector... I remember perfectly what happened that day. A man accused a woman of seducing him with witchcraft. You knew it, my father knew it, we all knew the woman was innocent. The guilty one was him, and he used Sigmar's name in vain. Still, he walked free. And the butcher who came to our village burned an innocent woman because he tortured her until she confessed… then he went to one of our towns and burned a hundred people because he deemed them guilty. Judge, jury, and executioner. We never knew why. We never received any report about what happened,\" I said, staring him down.\n\"I had to watch someone innocent die because a witch hunter was too zealous for Sigmar, and ignored all the established protocols,\" I added.\n\"That was a great mistake... and that witch hunter was punished in his time,\" the lector said gravely.\n\"Yes, of course... too late. But as you well know, I am a faithful servant of the Cult. I will have no problems with witch hunters entering my lands, as long as they behave. But I will not leave it to chance that a witch hunter, like the useless one you have interrogating me, decides to act on his own. So I accept to fund that witch hunter's barracks, but with conditions,\" I said firmly, not breaking eye contact with the lector.\n\"What would those conditions be?\" the lector asked, regaining his understanding expression.\n\"I want regular reports of every investigation they carry out. They are prohibited from making public executions without trial. They must always act alongside the urban guard, no going solo. No home searches without evidence. And, of course, they are forbidden from interrogating members of legal cults without evidence,\" I listed clearly.\n\"That limits the actions of the witch hunters greatly, baron… what if there's mass heresy?\" the lector asked, with some concern.\n\"Obviously, in that hypothetical case, the witch hunters can act with all the powers of their authority. I won't oppose if they act with justice. But it's necessary that, in times of peace, when harsh measures aren't needed, the hunters behave and do not scare the people,\" I clarified.\n\"In that case, I see that an agreement is possible. When could the construction of the witch hunter barracks in Reinsfeld begin?\" the lector asked.\n\"As soon as possible. As I said, if they accept my conditions, the witch hunters are more than welcome to work on my lands. I don't want a repeat of what happened, where innocent people were burned just because a witch hunter thought it was right,\" I replied.\n\"So it shall be done, young baron. I will make sure the agreement is respected. I will recommend to the theogonist who should be elected as the captain witch hunter of Reinsfeld, to avoid conflicts between both sides,\" said the lector, nodding.\n\"I'm glad we've reached an agreement. And I apologize, honorable servant of Sigmar, if I've offended you. But the safety of the people the Emperor has entrusted me to protect is a responsibility I take very seriously, and I can't leave it in the hands of someone who, for personal gain, breaks the chain of command as just happened,\" I said, extending my hand.\n\"I completely understand. I know you are not the type to get upset over nothing. There's always a good reason behind your actions. I'll inform the archlector of this deal, and we will begin building the barracks in an available area of the city,\" the lector replied, shaking my hand.\nI withdrew and immediately headed for the castle. I needed to speak with Hieronymus.\n\"Old man, are you here?\" I yelled as I climbed the tower stairs.\n\"Yes? What's going on?\" I heard Hieronymus's voice from the top of the tower.\n\"Bad news. A large group of witch hunters is in the city, so don't use Chamon,\" I warned while quickly climbing.\n\"Don't worry, I was testing one of those recipes you left me to practice,\" the old man replied.\nI quickly climbed, entering the laboratory, and found Hieronymus working carefully. He was making a mirror following the basic sketches I had left him. It was a process he hadn't fully mastered yet.\n\"You did well, considering you're working with this outdated equipment,\" I said, observing my reflection in the mirror.\n\"Bah, I made a lot of mistakes in the process. It could have been better... but that'll be for later. I can still improve much more. This was just practice,\" the mage replied, looking away from the glass.\n\"We could make good money with this... most mirrors are enchanted pieces or polished silver. We could make a good amount of crowns if we mass produce them,\" I said, surprised by the clarity of the image.\n\"Yes, but the problem now is the witch hunters... and their damn amulets that vibrate with magic. If your laboratory were hidden in the forges, the winds of Chamon could be strong enough to hide us from those fanatics' gaze. If we start working here while they're in town, we'll stick out like a purple thumb among the fingers, even if you can suppress your magic,\" Hieronymus said seriously.\n\"How about working in the mountains? The dwarves have made considerable progress with the underground part of the new laboratory. Maybe we could go check how it's going and move all the equipment there. That way we could work without worrying about witch hunters. We could use all the magic we want without fear. There are no Sigmar priests or witch hunters in those mines... and the winds drawn by the minerals and dwarven metal would give us the perfect conditions to study,\" I proposed, approaching the work table.\n\"Yeah... not a bad idea. And that way, I stop climbing these damn stairs. Do you realize it takes me longer to climb them than to perform the experiment?\" the old man grumbled.\n\"Then it's settled. Let's pack up. We're leaving. This laboratory has already become too small for what we can achieve in the future,\" I said, smiling as we began packing the equipment.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.The source of thɪs content is No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

All the rooms had already been excavated, the spaces defined, and the dawi were working on placing the metal walls according to my specifications. These walls were made of several layers of dwarven metals with security runes, runes of silence, concealment, and blocking, to prevent any demon from sensing the presence of the laboratory.\nAt least that part was already operational. The rune smith had worked tirelessly to complete the core of the protection system as soon as possible, as they wanted to start generating income as soon as possible. That's why, when I arrived with Hieronymus, we were warmly welcomed, even before the entire construction was completed. We began installing the laboratory with the help of the dawi, expanding what had previously been done between just two people to a much larger scale, thanks to the number of hands available.\nMany of the dwarves sent by Duran were eager to see me work and learn the process of producing smokeless powder. So, for several days, while we set up the equipment, I began teaching them how to produce nitrocellulose. Once all the artisans had learned to work with the acids and mastered the complete process, we used all the cotton stores I had saved. In just two days, we produced tons of smokeless powder.\nAs much as I wanted to start with the production of cordite, the part of the laboratory dedicated to that process was still not finished. The special runes required to maintain stable temperatures and reduce the risk of spontaneous ignition were missing, so for now, I settled for those huge reserves of powder.\nAs we had agreed, we delivered the smokeless powder to the dawi, who took responsibility for transporting it to all the known dwarf settlements. They would try to sell it to other clans. If we were lucky, this would make me immensely rich.\nBut we didn't stop there.\nWe reached another agreement to help me produce pigments for sale in the human cities. I doubt the dawi would be interested in clothing dyes, as many preferred their traditional methods. Still, I taught them how to produce blue, orange, yellow, and red dyes. As long as we didn't have access to cotton from Araby, this would allow us to maintain a constant production of tradeable goods, since these pigments required more common resources.\nI didn't plan to flood the market, but I did want to generate steady income for my coffers. In exchange, the dawi would receive 30% of the profits for their labor. It was no longer necessary for Hieronymus or me to handle everything; we had over a hundred dwarves happy to perfect their craft, acquiring knowledge that would allow them to safely and profitably produce chemical dyes.\nSo, when Rutger passed near the new mining town for the first time—since the notice reached him when he went to the castle and found no one—he brought the usual twelve thousand crowns we earned every week selling our products. He arrived quite upset that he had to travel several more hours just to load his carts, but his mood changed completely when he saw what I had prepared.\nInstead of the usual five kilograms of pigment I handed him weekly, this time I gave him nearly fifty kilograms, of all colors. Of course, the blue pigment was still the most expensive. This would allow me not only to target the noble market but also the bourgeois.\nRutger, with a barely concealed smile, filled his carts with jars of pigment and happily set off to Nuln to sell them for me.\nThe gold I earned that week was entirely spent on recruiting more men. I wanted to expand my personal forces to three thousand, leaving the local militia solely in charge of Reinsfeld's protection. My troops, on the other hand, would be used to continue gaining prestige as the great cleanser of the Grey Mountains... and even for a possible journey to the Drakwald forest to take advantage of the rewards offered by Elector Count Boris Todbringer for beastman hunting.\nSo, I recruited another fifteen hundred men. Although, clearly, almost all of them were migrants. There were no more Reikland men of combat age who weren't fully dedicated to farming or craftsmanship. Only those who had come from other provinces remained... and I couldn't resist. Their physical build was evidently superior—taller and stronger than the average Reiklander. Qualities very useful for war.Google seaʀᴄh ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nDuring that last month, while everything was being prepared for the harvest work, I carried out the recruitment and, at the same time, executed a key political act: I gained the favor of the parents of the young men who hadn't yet sent their children to my school, which continued to grow as more classrooms were finished.\nWhile we selected the new recruits, I began distributing heavy steel plows to all the families who wanted them, using the steel produced in my forges. I didn't give them the horses, of course. That kept everyone eating out of my hand, as I was the only one still with all the available draft horses in the region.\nSo, every peasant family received one of these heavy plows and could use my horses to help with the hard work of plowing the land. It would now be much easier for them, even without the help of their children for all the extra work.\nWith new pikes, freshly forged armor, and newly assembled mail shirts, we immediately began training. But this time, we did it with a different approach: physical training that, at the same time, would help the city. With three thousand soldiers at my disposal, we began digging irrigation channels, connecting all the possible farmlands to the river that descended from the Grey Mountains.\nWe had the help of one of Otto's minor architects, as much of the house construction work had slowed down: now everyone had a home. But soon, everything would become complicated again. The migrants kept arriving.\nWe dug tunnels, reinforced them with bricks and mortar, and extended them throughout my territory. On many occasions, when the peasants noticed what we were doing, they joined in, knowing that in the end, it would mean less effort for irrigation throughout the rest of the year.\nIn this way, I continued to use my army as an infrastructure construction force. We helped the village constantly, extending irrigation channels for miles, always under the architect's supervision.\nThe weapon of choice this time were the muskets. I had many in reserve, and my armorers were already producing five muskets a day. Thanks to this, the number of musketeers in my pike formations grew considerably, beginning to resemble a true Spanish tercio: pikes at the front, halberds on the flanks, musketeers ready to disperse and return to the safety of the pikes.\nAll that was left was more training, so that, when we took them to the battlefield, they would show themselves as the professional force I was forming. A couple of months more, and I would have a fully armed army. With that, I could finally go hunt beastmen.\nThe days passed with relative tranquility. The migrants kept arriving, increasingly attracted by the safety offered by my domain and the growing merchant city that now rivaled the Imperial promises.\nDuring this time, for the first time in years, I allowed myself to enjoy my noble status. Not having to work in the afternoons and nights preparing pigments, I took possession of the kitchen in the castle and prepared some dishes I missed: fried potatoes, and a good hamburger made with the best meat from a freshly sacrificed cow.\nIt was the first time I stopped eating simple foods. I always tried to set an example and rarely ate better than my soldiers... except for my soup pills. Those were usually made with spices that could cost a soldier his monthly wage, but it was the only thing I allowed myself to splurge on.\nWell, and my runic weapons and armor... that would be generations of some soldiers' wages, honestly.\nIt was one of those nights, while I generously ate a burger with cheese that had just finished aging, when visitors arrived.\n\"My lord, excuse the intrusion, but a knight claiming to serve General Magnus Von Abresicht has come to deliver a message to you in person,\" said one of my men-at-arms.\nI wiped my mouth. \"Let him in,\" I said, wiping a bit where I had been eating and making myself presentable.\nIt didn't take long before a knight fully armored with plate entered. He walked in and stared at me.\n\"Baron Albrecht von Reinsfeld, General Magnus Von Abresicht demands your presence at his war camp on the outskirts of Helmgart immediately. I also present that he requests you to come under his service by imperial decree, delivering the men who, by law, must enter the Imperial army... and he requests, extraordinarily, that you bring all of your personal guard in consideration of something you already know,\" said the knight.\n\"What's happening? Are we at war? Or is there a rebellion?\" I asked, wondering what was going on for a general to summon the forces of nobles who were supposed to serve in the Imperial army.\n\"I don't know, baron... all I know is I was sent to deliver the message, so with your permission, I'll take my leave,\" said the knight, bowing and leaving the room.\n\"Oh damn... and I owe him a favor for the permit to produce weapons... this comes at a terrible time. My men are somewhat green, although they have a lot of experience with the musket, so it's not so terrible,\" I said while changing rooms.\nBut with the problem with the Kesselheim active, if I leave my lands with little protection, it would be the perfect time for them to take advantage of the fact that my lands are unprotected... but if I don't go, I'll look like someone untrustworthy... that would kill me politically, where every deal could be called into question by refusing to fulfill a favor I owed to an Imperial general, one of the most influential politicians within the Empire.\n\"I have nearly two thousand militiamen, veterans of the state regiments... that should be enough to scare the Kesselheim... but I don't have walls... they could come at night and try to burn the city... I'll have to ask my apprentice for a favor if anything happens,\" I said, taking paper and quill.\nSo I sent a letter to Hieronymus about what had happened, asking him to please, in case my men notice any presence of the Kesselheim, act in secret to try to prevent them from attacking: by turning their armors into lead or rusting all their equipment, something my wizard master could do.\nWe should only hide Hieronymus for a few weeks, maybe months, in the fortress the dwarves are building for me, and that should be enough. Since I wouldn't be in the city, they shouldn't suspect me. If Hieronymus does it using his Golden Order mask, they shouldn't realize he's my financial advisor.\nWith the letter ready and sent to the wizard, I began preparing my men for whatever the Emperor and his general wanted to do.\n\"Damn... it was cheaper to bribe than owe a favor,\" I cursed as I prepared my armor.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The cost of having three thousand hired men was one thing, but another entirely was having them march off somewhere else, as that meant I would need to have supply carts. The cost of maintaining my men—which was around five hundred crowns a day—could easily double or triple depending on the food prices in the area, if my logistics line failed.\nRegardless, I called all my men from their posts and left five of the Carroburg greatswords as the respective captains of the militia, as they were the only ones with the temperament to deal with the witch hunters if they felt they could do whatever they wanted while the local lord was away.\nOnce all my men were gathered and all the armor and uniforms that could be collected in the area were gathered, we standardized them as much as possible. My troops looked as orderly as possible, wearing dark blue uniforms, which stood out much more at the joints of their armor or on their trousers.\nSo, as the day was still young, our march to Helmgart began. It seemed like all the training for endurance paid off, as we were at least able to maintain good mobilization on the roads, and it looked like the order was kept as we moved quickly.\nWe crossed the river and continued without problems, and as we passed through the village of Holthusen, many of the local children began trying to imitate us, marching beside us with straight sticks as if they were mimicking my men's posture while they carried pikes along the road.\nEverything seemed peaceful until we reached Ussingen. The village was clearly damaged. Many buildings were burned.\nSpurring my horse, I approached the village, and upon seeing me, the peasants ran off.\nI entered the village without resistance when some guards came out of the buildings. Upon seeing my armor, they relaxed.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar. What happened here?\" I said, performing the comet salute.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, noble. A Bretonnian patrol managed to cross the Grey Mountains and attacked us,\" said one of the guards, who seemed relieved not to have to fight against someone armed like a knight.\n\"The Bretonnians crossed?\" I said, surprised.\n\"Yes, noble lord. They burned some buildings and looted the barns before returning the way they came,\" said the guard.\n\"Thank you for the information, guard… I won't bother you further. Continue with the reconstruction… may Sigmar protect you,\" I said, turning back to my forces.\nSo, Bretonnians, huh? I think it's been two years since the border war between the margrave and the duke ended, but it looks like the Bretonnians are back for a second fight.\nWe continued on the road, picking up the pace a little to avoid having to camp and so we could continue the march the next day. When we reached Eilhart, the sight was the same: all the vineyards that characterized the village had been burned, and many peasants were trying to rebuild their homes, which were somewhat scorched.\nWhen we reached Ussingen, it was a bit different. There were burned houses, but much less. It was clear the place had been defended properly by the presence of the state regiments, so the Bretonnians hadn't been able to do much.\nWhen it was getting dark and it seemed the sun was about to disappear, we arrived at the Imperial camp, where the flags of the Princes of Altdorf, the Elector Count of Reikland, and the Empire flew, alongside many noble houses displaying their coats of arms.\nIt didn't take long for my men to stow their combat gear and start preparing the tents, adding to the growing Imperial army that was gathering outside Helmgart, reaching several thousand, especially with the addition of my troops.\nI asked around for the general, but all his men told me he was sleeping and that I should ask for him tomorrow. So, that's what I did. I made sure my men's food was distributed and that everything was ready, since who knows how long we'd be camping while the rest of the nobles with military obligations to the Emperor arrived.\nThe next day, when the sun was rising, I entered again into the sea of tents with different coats of arms and finally met with the general, who was arguing with other nobles.\nThe general looked at me, surprised.\n\"Well... Albrecht... that was quick... I expected you at least... four more days,\" said the general, clearly surprised.\n\"I arrived last night, but you were sleeping,\" I replied, taking an empty chair and sitting down in front of the general. The other nobles stared at me.\n\"Even more surprising... How many men did you bring? That's what matters most here,\" said the general, pointing to his assistant, who had paper and pen in hand.\n\"Three thousand men... general,\" I replied, observing the faces of the nobles, who looked at me, surprised.\n\"Three thousand men... quite a number... I think I made a good bet on you, baron. When this campaign is over, I'll make sure your participation wasn't in vain,\" said the general, beginning to smile.\n\"Well then... who are we marching against? Because your messenger couldn't tell me why we were marching,\" I said, crossing my arms.The most update n0vels are published on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\n\"Bretonnia... The margrave and the duke have continued their fights. Apparently, another conflict broke out when the Bretonnians allowed some greenskins to attack an Imperial caravan, and the margrave responded by attacking Bretonnian caravans. This escalated. More and more skirmishes happened until the margrave burned some of the duke's villages, and the duke did the same with the margrave's villages. So we have to finish this,\" said the general.\n\"Oh, I see. So... we burn some Bretonnian villages and return to Helmgart?\" I asked again.\n\"No... we will take Monfort. And then we'll return and clean the mountains, looking for the Greenskin clan that's been attacking Imperial caravans,\" said the general.\n\"You want to take Monfort?\" I said, surprised. \"But that means we'll be facing the Bretonnian ducal armies.\"\n\"What's the matter? Are you a coward who fears the Bretonnians?\" one of the nobles said.\nI stared at him and stood up, drawing my sword. I heard the general's guards do the same.\n\"Do you want to settle this outside?\" I said to the noble, who had his eyes wide open, staring at my runic sword.\nHe just shook his head and didn't say anything more.\n\"Coward,\" I said, sheathing my sword. Everything calmed down again.\n\"A runic sword, huh?\" the general said, laughing quietly. \"Bretonnia is weak right now. They just suffered a huge defeat at the hands of the greenskins. There's talk of thousands of Bretonnian knights dead, and who knows how many of their men-at-arms and peasants. Of a great Bretonnian army, only a handful of men returned… or so our spies say. So, the Empire is in a good position to punish the Bretonnians for their insolence. If we manage to take Monfort and turn it into an Imperial outpost, it will open a new era of Imperial advances within Bretonnia. And who knows… maybe a new great noble could rise in those enemy lands,\" the general said, smiling.\n\"I see... when do we leave?\" I asked the general.\n\"We're waiting for some mercenary companies I sent to hire from Nuln, and some militia regiments from nobles who owe me favors. So, we should have about sixteen thousand men before we march into Bretonnia and show those horse-loving, starving peasants why Imperial steel and black powder are superior,\" the general said.\n\"I understand... then, if you'll excuse me, I have things to prepare,\" I said, standing up.\n\"Of course, I'll have you called if I need anything from you, Albrecht. By the way, how many firearms are your men bringing? I'll supply the powder so it won't hit your finances too hard,\" the general said, with a friendly tone.\n\"About a thousand. But I have my own powder supplies, general. I would appreciate it more if you could help with feeding my men, if possible,\" I responded to the general's generous offer.\n\"Of course, I'll make sure some of the supplies being delivered by the locals are sent to your men, baron... thanks for coming. You may leave,\" said the general, pointing to the exit.\nI left the tent and stretched a little. Everything seemed to indicate that this was going to take a while, as we had to wait for other forces to arrive. So, for a couple of days, I took the opportunity to have my men train, practicing all sorts of complicated maneuvers, especially when we were in confined spaces and attacked from all directions.\nWe trained turns of ninety... one hundred and eighty degrees, to be ready to resist Bretonnian cavalry attacks, which would be the most dangerous thing we could face. Since only... Sigmar knows what will happen in Bretonnia... we'll probably face a bunch of knights, huge mobs of peasants, and plenty of Grail Knights, who should arrive in large numbers, especially since when their sanction is in danger, they have mass visions of their Lady.\nSo, it wouldn't surprise me if we face a lot of resistance in Bretonnian territory. That's why training is never too much. In fact, I was making everyone train as if it were normal. And I, too, because I couldn't afford to lose too many men. I had little to recruit from, as they were all migrants, and it was already clear to me that hiring foreigners was unpopular among the Reiklanders.\nA few days passed and more nobles arrived, bringing their knights and personal troops, while many mercenary companies from Nuln arrived in small groups, joining us.\nEven, to our surprise, a group of ogres arrived, wearing armor and holding what appeared to be blunderbusses.\nApparently, the general hadn't spared any expense and had brought expensive ogre mercenaries, who must charge a lot considering their potential skills and size.\nIn the camp, while I observed the largest army I had ever seen... such a gathering of men meant that sooner or later we'd be bombarded with artillery like a rain of drones... so seeing so many men in one place made me a little nervous because of the memories.\nBut it didn't take long for me to recognize a coat of arms I was very familiar with... the coat of arms of the Margraves of Helmgart, who had recently joined the camp.\nI noticed a group of knights from the margrave's house talking to someone wearing armor and a bit shorter than them, and I recognized him immediately.\nThe knights stopped and stared at me as I approached, but the one I was getting closer to didn't.\n\"Well, if it isn't my good friend Joachim,\" I said, putting my arm around his neck, noticing that I was much bigger than the firstborn son of the margrave.\n\"Hey, who do you think... gasp... Albrecht... by Sigmar, you're huge!\" he said, breathless.\n\"What's with the reaction, you damn fool? Shouldn't it be, 'But if it isn't my good friend Albrecht who saved my life'?\" I said, tightening my arm around him.\n\"Albrecht... my father is here... you should leave, you don't know how he gets when someone mentions your name,\" said Joachim, becoming agitated.\n\"And you think I'm afraid of your father?\" I said, grinning.\n\"Well... he's been really angry lately about what's been happening to his vassals' villages,\" said Joachim.\n\"That's obvious, who wouldn't be angry when their vassals' villages are burned down? Come on, tell me... are you ready to spill Bretonnian blood like I did two years ago, huh?\" I said to Joachim.\n\"I'm not allowed to participate, but I must be present until our men leave,\" Joachim said.\n\"Really? I thought I'd have to save your life from some Bretonnian peasant,\" I said with a grin.\n\"One thing is a beastman, and another very different one is a starving Bretonnian,\" Joachim said, removing my arm from his neck.\n\"Well then, my friend, how's life?\" I said with a smile.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

With the cannons, we could smash the walls of Monfort and take the fortification. While the plan seemed solid, the problem was the second step: if we managed to take Monfort, holding it would be a pain in the ass. Because all those damned Bretonnians would charge at us like rabid dogs. I hope the general has something planned, like reinforcements from the capital or that another army is being formed while we're in Bretonnia... because honestly, I doubt we'll leave there victorious.\nBut there we were, around 18,000 men that the general had gathered, far more than he had expected. Though that didn't erase the bad taste in my mouth.\nWhen the general decided he had enough men, he simply sent the order to break camp and start marching toward Bretonnia.\nFortunately, my men, being highly disciplined and standardized, were wanted by the general to stay fresh for any important combat that might arise later. Therefore, we didn't get too many complicated tasks, beyond marching along the steep roads that separated Bretonnia from the Empire.\nThe skirmishes, many of them, were carried out by the general's mercenaries, who moved well along the treacherous paths. Especially the ogres. We saw how a Bretonnian knight was struck down and turned into pulp along with his horse, and then the ogre ate the horse.\nMany of those skirmishes were fought by the mercenaries, who seemed eager to participate, as they were taking everything they got.\nAnd this time, compared to the previous one, which was just a minor skirmish, now it was an open war between the Empire and Bretonnia. That's why I approached the mercenaries who had recently seized Bretonnian horses from some knights, and I started buying them. Most likely, I could keep them as war spoils and improve the breed of my horses in a few years. I could probably sell them for a very high price in the Imperial markets, as nobles won't resist an Imperial warhorse with Bretonnian pedigree.\nThe hard ones to convince were the ogres, because damn it, those guys just wanted to eat the horses and their riders. But apparently, they weren't allowed to eat humans... for now. I had to do a lot of mental juggling to get them to understand that with the gold I was giving them, they could buy even more food than the horse, and much tastier. And when I managed to make myself understood, they accepted the deal, thus saving the horses that were going to be their meal that same day.\nWhen we finally camped, we were assigned some night guard duties and kept an eye on the Bretonnian movements observed from some hills not far off.\nWe kept advancing and only found abandoned Bretonnian camps, as the numbers were on our side, while the Bretonnians could only retreat, losing ground.\nAs we kept moving, we found empty villages. Apparently, the Bretonnians had evacuated their peasants in time before they fell victim to the mercenaries.\nDuring the march, there were many problems with the horses that were transporting the cannons, as many times the carts broke down, and we had to waste time repairing them or trying to push them. Without the cannons, there was nothing we could do against the fortifications of Monfort.\nOnce again, we had to camp after a long day of slow marching over the rough terrain, which wasn't making things any easier. But on my part, I kept talking to the mercenaries and buying many of the things they took from the Bretonnians. I was buying armor that was in good condition to try and cover some of the shortcomings my men had, so I bought everything useful and, at the same time, all the available horses.\nOn the third day of marching, the largest skirmish so far took place. A group of Bretonnian knights charged against the vanguard of the column, where they managed to cause many casualties among the poorly armed militia gathered by some nobles from Bogenhafen. But by the end of the day, many of those knights ended up dead, either during the charge or when the knights of all the nobles united launched themselves against the Bretonnians, driving them to flee, overwhelmed by the losses they suffered in that battle.The most update n0vels are published on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nIt took time to regroup the marching column, but we kept advancing along the road, while the skirmishes continued at all times between the mercenaries and the Bretonnian knights, along with their men-at-arms, who desperately tried to buy as much time as possible.\nWhen we reached the village of Juinard, as usual, it was completely empty. The knights had evacuated their peasants. But we were at the gates of Monfort: we only needed to cross a river to the east, and we would have the Duke's fortress right in front of us. However, to the west lay the Duchy of Parravon.\nTaking advantage of the fact that the Imperial forces were organizing to cross the river—since the mercenaries had expelled the knights from their defensive points—I decided to prepare a little gift for the possible reinforcements coming from the west.\nI had brought thorns that I had ordered to be made with some leftover iron during the days we waited for the general's forces. Something very simple to make: a piece of metal with four sharp points, always leaving one pointing up.\nBefore we crossed the bridge to Monfort, I ordered my men to scatter them along the road leading to Parravon, so that any reinforcements trying to catch us from behind would get a very unpleasant surprise.\nWith the road covered in thorns, we continued the march, crossing the river by the bridge heading toward Monfort.\nThat same day, we broke camp and began preparations for what would be one of the toughest battles we'd face in a long, long time.\nBy midday, a Bretonnian knight arrived, although it seemed he was on our side. Quite rare.\nI made sure my part of the camp was set up, at least with a decent palisade for us. If something went wrong, I wanted to have a place to retreat to.\nThe next morning, the camp was a hive of activity. Men preparing, cleaning their weapons, checking their ammunition. The Imperial engineers were running back and forth, making sure the cannons were ready to be hauled or fired.\nI took the opportunity to check the terrain. I didn't like it at all. There were too many steep hills that hindered clear lines of fire. To make matters worse, Monfort was well positioned, guarding the only exit to the east of the mountain passes. If the Bretonnians entrenched themselves there, taking the walls would be a bloodbath.\nI got my men ready and had them prepare for the worst. The terrain wasn't good for our tercio-style formations, but it wasn't favorable for cavalry charges either. It was a ruin for everyone.\nWe waited for the general's orders, which finally arrived. Our mission: to scale the mountains to the south if possible and completely encircle the Monfort knights. Another noble had the same task, but from the north.\nWe prepared for that. Scaling those steep mountains with war gear wouldn't be easy. As we organized, we were surprised by what happened: the Monfort knights were coming out of the fortress.\n\"Idiots,\" I murmured when I saw them leave the walls. They came out with men-at-arms and a large number of peasants armed with whatever they had: farming tools, sickles, hammers, shovels.\n\"Baron Albrecht!\" shouted a knight who was riding toward me from behind. \"Change of plans! The general wants to crush the Bretonnian force immediately.\" He was riding between the nobles to deliver the change in strategy.\nWe obeyed the Imperial chain of command.\nWe immediately began to form up. I organized my men in the usual tercio formation: halberdiers at the front, with nearly full armor; behind them, a mass of musketeers ready to fire at my command; in the center, pikemen, prepared to resist any frontal charge.\nWe formed a battle line as straight as the uneven terrain would allow, ready to face the Bretonnian fanatics who had made the mistake of leaving their walls.\nWe began to advance slowly, maintaining formation while the Imperial forces were running to take control of some elevated positions advantageous for artillery and Imperial arquebusiers.\nWe faced men-at-arms and peasants.\nFor some strange reason, the fight hadn't started yet. The Bretonnians were letting us position ourselves in good spots for the artillery. They also took some good positions, but their lack of firearms made them almost ineffective. Especially because their peasant archers weren't the best. They were just that: peasants with a bow who, by some luck, knew how to use it.\nThe advance continued until both armies were face to face, one in front of the other, staring at each other from hills, waiting for the general's order to attack.\nWe stood there for a few minutes… until the first cannon shot from the right flank hill rang out. Then, several more explosions followed. Huge chunks of iron flew through the air. Although many missed, some hit directly, striking a group of peasants and sending bodies flying.\nFinally, the battle began. The Bretonnian forces started to move.\nAs we descended, I noticed a group of Grail Knights charging straight at the center of our forces.\n\"Shit!... one... two... three... four... five... five Grail Knights,\" I said as my forces descended the hill, seeing the large group of knights charging furiously at our center.\nWhen we reached flat ground, we found ourselves face to face with a lot of men-at-arms from the House of Monfort, displaying their heraldry everywhere.\nMy men lowered their pikes and presented them to an enemy that only had swords. The difference in reach was vast.\nOur formations moved slowly, both sides trying not to crash too soon.\n\"Musketeers!\" I shouted.\nMy musketeers moved from the flanks, running, and formed three perfect lines further ahead, without blocking the pikemen's advance. They all positioned themselves, aiming their muskets.\n\"Fire!\" I shouted.\nAnd hundreds of muskets fired, almost without generating any smoke on our side. The first line crouched as they began to reload; the second line aimed their muskets and fired, then crouched, and the third line fired immediately. Then, they all stood up and began to reload.\nI immediately saw the chaos in the Bretonnian formation: hundreds of their men had fallen.\nAt that moment, while my musketeers prepared to fire again, I saw a massive number of arrows coming towards us.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

We moved ahead of the halberdiers and spread out in three clearly defined lines, careful not to obstruct the pikemen's progress, who continued their slow and steady march.\nI aimed my musket at those damned Bretonnians, who were approaching in a tight formation, packed like sheep on their way to slaughter. I put the ear protector in my left ear and waited for the order.\n\"¡¡¡Fire!!!\", the baron's voice thundered again.\nI squeezed the trigger. The mechanism clicked and the powder exploded with a brutal jolt. Dozens of detonations followed mine.\nI crouched instinctively and began preparing the next round. I cleaned the barrel, tore off the paper from the powder cartridge, and as I hurried, a second volley thundered above our heads. As I was about to load the ammunition, the third shot rang out. I stood up and finished reloading, ready to fire again... but then I saw something strange.\nFrom behind their lines, the Bretonnian peasant archers released a rain of arrows. I instinctively raised my arms to shield myself, but I only felt soft taps on my armor. Confused, I looked around... and understood.\nThe arrows had no tips. They were just splintered sticks.\n\"How miserable must those Bretonnian dogs be to not even have arrowheads!?\" someone shouted behind me.\n\"Bet they melted them down to pay their feudal taxes!\" shouted another, followed by general laughter.\nThe entire line burst into laughter, mocking those poorly armed peasant levies.\n\"¡¡¡Fire!!!\", the baron shouted again, relentless.\nI aimed again. The Bretonnian men-at-arms tried to close ranks and advance. I squeezed the trigger once more. The bullets whistled, hitting directly against the enemy formation. Dozens fell like broken scarecrows, wrapped in screams and blood.\nWe reloaded. Fired. Again and again. Wave after wave. Each shot of lead ripped life from their ranks. Another rain of arrows fell upon us, and once again, they were just harmless sticks. They hit, yes, but barely hurt.\nWe fired four more volleys before the Bretonnians, desperate, charged.\nWe saw them coming, furious, shouting, stumbling between dead bodies and bloodied mud.\n\"¡¡¡Musketeers, retreat!!!\", the baron commanded authoritatively.\nWe obeyed immediately. We fell back in an orderly fashion between the lines, yielding the front to the halberdiers. We withdrew to the flanks, staying alert... waiting for the next opportunity to bleed the enemy dry.\n-----------------------------------\nPOV of Pikeman\n\"Ready... ready... ready!\" the baron shouted, his voice booming through the ranks as we adjusted our pikes.\nThe Bretonnian men-at-arms came charging. They wanted to reach us before the musketeers could fire again. But we were already prepared.\nI pressed the back end of my pike against the ground, tilting it forward, aiming straight at the chest of the wave of steel and muscle rushing towards us. The ground trembled beneath their steps.\nSome stopped just before impact… but not all. Several impaled themselves on the tips of our pikes, pierced in the weak spots of their armor. One fell, screaming with his throat pierced. Another writhed with a pike lodged in his thigh.\nThey were desperate, trying to force their way through our lines, but the pikes were many, and the gaps were few. They tried to cut the shafts with their swords, pushed with their shields, kicked like rats trapped... but the formation held.\n\"Push... push... push!\" the baron ordered, and we all obeyed.\nWith the creaking of wood and metal, the entire line began to advance, shoulder to shoulder, pushing the Bretonnians back. But their own comrades behind them kept pushing them forward, trapping them between our pikes and their own ranks.\nThe result was bloody chaos: crushed men, others impaled, screams muffled by blood. Many died without even being able to swing their swords.\nFrom the left wing, we heard again the dry roar of muskets. Our comrades were flanking the enemy. Each shot tore through flesh and steel, pushing them even closer to the brink of collapse.\nAnother rain of Bretonnian arrows fell upon us. Again, just sticks with feathers. They hit, bounced off, even made us laugh as we pushed death onto our enemies.\nWe still had no casualties. Not a single one. But the Bretonnians... the Bretonnians fell like wheat before the scythe. Still, they pushed with fury. For a moment, it seemed like they might break our line.\nAnd then, the baron himself and his bodyguards sprang into action.\nThe baron sliced through a man-at-arms with a single stroke of his sword. His imperial steel cut through effortlessly. By his side, the GreatSwords charged like hungry wolves, dismembering the Bretonnians who had managed to get too close. The Bretonnian discipline crumbled. Their formation collapsed.\nUnder the pressure of our pikes, the incessant fire of the musketeers, and the carnage unleashed by the baron's personal guard, the men-at-arms of Monfort began to retreat. Then they fled.\nWe had won.\n\"NINETY DEGREE TURN! CAVALRY ON OUR RIGHT!\" the baron shouted.\nWe turned immediately, trained for this, and saw it.\nA wave of Bretonnian knights charged at us like a storm of lances and neighing horses.\n--------------------\nPOV of Halberdier\nSeeing a large group of Bretonnian cavalry charging towards us, the pikemen began to open the formation, widening the square to receive the charge. Without wasting time, all the nearby soldiers ran to seek protection within the pike wall.\nQuickly, several lines reorganized, forming a perfect square with pikes pointing in all directions.\nThe knights charged with strength, lances lowered, but before they could reach impact, the musketeers on the left wing advanced from the formation. As the riders lowered their lances... they were met with a rain of lead.\nDozens of horses fell. Some collapsed immediately, others stumbled over the bodies of the first ones, causing total chaos in the midst of the charge. Riders were sent flying through the air, the thunder of hooves mixed with the crunching of bones and the screams of the wounded.\nThe musketeers showed no mercy. Seeing that the charge had broken, they fired again. The bullets cut down the knights who tried to get up, struck shields, and pierced armor. Each shot claimed another life.\nBut the Bretonnian rear didn't stop. The riders who hadn't been hit began a new charge. This time, the musketeers were reloading, with no time to stop them. The Bretonnians lowered their lances and charged directly at us, while the musketeers reentered the square.\nExcept their horses didn't follow them.\nMany beasts, gripped by fear, refused to charge against our pikes. They stopped dead in their tracks, reared up on two legs, throwing their riders off. The few that obeyed... ended up impaled, throwing their masters like broken dolls against our ranks. There, we immediately surrounded them, taking them down with ten or fifteen pikemen before they could raise their swords.\nThe remaining knights began to circle around us, searching for a weak point, trying to break the formation or cut our pikes. But it was useless. From every angle, the pikes prevented them from advancing. And from the center of the square, the musketeers, who had already reloaded, fired with precision at anyone who took too long with their attempts.\nWe literally had hundreds of knights circling us like frustrated wolves. But the baron had prepared us for this. He had trained us to exhaustion to maintain this formation, and now everything made sense. We were killing knights as if they were mere peasants.\nFinally, the Bretonnians' will broke. Seeing that they had lost much of their number without making a single breakthrough, they began to retreat. Then, we exited the square in an orderly manner, and with the halberdiers, we combined forces to capture every knight who was still breathing. We disarmed them and dragged them to the center of the formation, where they were guarded as prisoners.\nOur front was intact. Tired, but firm. We regrouped and began to retreat, while a small detachment took the prisoners to the camp and left in search of more ammunition and powder.\nBut upon reaching the center of the front, the scene was different.\nThere, things hadn't gone as cleanly. Several of our own knights lay dead, their armor broken, the banners knocked down. The Bretonnian charge here had been brutal.\nThen we saw what was coming: a large contingent of peasants, men-at-arms, and knights advanced towards us. At the head was a woman riding a horse with a horn, dressed in radiant white. By her side rode a massive knight with the Grail heraldry.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nWe stopped. But then the woman brought her hand to her neck. She staggered.\nBoth we and the Bretonnians watched, not understanding what was happening. But their faces... the faces of the Bretonnians... reflected pure horror.\nThe woman kept bringing her hands to her throat, gasping. Then she fell from her mount and began writhing on the ground, soiling her white dress, seized by convulsions. Several men ran to help her, kneeling at her side, shouting words at her in their language.\nThe Grail knight dismounted from his steed to assist her, desperate.\n\"Come on, come on, come on! Push them, they're distracted!!\" shouted the baron, his voice like a whip that tore us from our astonishment.\nThe musketeers began to move, the pikemen too. We advanced quickly, reorganizing the ranks, ready to take advantage of the enemy's confusion.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Manipulating the metal of the collar around the Bretonnian sorceress's neck. An ornate silver ring, ideal for this. I made it compress slowly, closing like a trap, crushing her throat, preventing her from uttering a word… and therefore, preventing her from casting spells that could turn the battle around.\nThe sorceress fell from her unicorn, rolling on the ground, her white dress stained with mud as she clutched her neck and desperately gasped for air. Her followers screamed, running around her, not understanding what was happening.\nThe musketeers didn't waste the opportunity. At every attempt of rescue, a volley of lead rose. Dozens of Bretonnians fell dead trying to help her, confused, helpless in the sight of one of their sacred figures choking in front of them for no visible reason.\nSoon, chaos was total.\nMany broke ranks. Others retreated. Only the knights remained, clinging to their code of honor as if that could stop the bullets.\nThe largest of them all, the one bearing the heraldry of the Grail, stepped in between us and the sorceress's body. He stood firm, with his shield in front and sword drawn. He remained there, silent, not stepping back, ready to receive whatever came.\nSome tried to lift her… but the gauntlets of those who touched her began to melt in their hands. Several screamed in pain, burned alive down to their bones.\nThe Grail knight was the only one who didn't step back.\n\"What an honorable act,\" I murmured with a twisted smile. Then I shouted, \"Let's go, boys!! Give that knight a prize!! Give him all the lead yours muskets can carry!!\"\nThree full lines were formed. All aiming at the same man. Three hundred muskets.\n\"¡¡Fire!!\"\nThe sound was deafening. A wall of fire and smoke covered the field. The knight was torn apart. His shield flew through the air, his armor splintered, his body pierced dozens of times before he fell to his knees… and finally to the ground.\nI ran toward him after the volley. I wanted to check for myself. The armor was shattered, blood pouring from every crack. He was dead. It would have been miraculous for him to survive that.\nShe, on the other hand, was still alive.\nThe sorceress gasped for air. She was purple, her eyes reddened from the suffocation, but alive. With her last strength, she tried to claw at the collar, as if she could still take it off.\n\"It's a shame you can't live,\" I said. \"Someone like you is worth a fortune, but I'll just collect for your body.\"\nI finally finished suffocating her, and the sorceress died, her face purple and her eyes bloody from all she had endured. I would have liked to let her live. I could have made a lot of money from her rescue, but she could easily say I was a mage, and I didn't want that. Even a rumor from the enemy could be enough to have people investigate me for unauthorized magic, so I had to settle for whatever they would pay me for returning her body to the Bretonnians.\nOne of ours picked up the body of the Grail knight. We covered it with a cloak and brought it back to the safety of the center of our formation.\nClimbing the hill, I finally had a full view of the field.\nThe right flank remained firm. Our sharpshooters kept tearing apart the Bretonnian formations with a constant rain of lead. But the center… the center was giving way.\nThat's where the bulk of the enemy army had fallen. Knights, peasants, men-at-arms… and above all, the last Grail knights. The weight of their charge had pushed our men back. I saw our standards tangled with theirs, and blood everywhere.\nI didn't sense another sorcerer on the field. We had eliminated their greatest magical threat. That gave us room. I took a deep breath. The battle was still undecided, but the enemy's heart had been broken.\nWe resumed the march just as our men arrived from the camp, bringing more ammunition and powder for the musketeers. We had to return to the front.\nAs we advanced, a small group of Bretonnian knights approached us. They were few, far too few to be a threat. We didn't even bother forming a defensive line. Only a few musketeers raised their weapons, just in case.\n\"I want to speak with your knight,\" one of them said in a rough Reikspiel, with such a strong Bretonnian accent it almost sounded mocking.\n\"Bah. Let's finish this. Shoot them,\" I ordered with a hand gesture, uninterested.\n\"I am Duke Folcard of Monfort,\" the knight responded before being turned into a sieve of lead.\n\"Stop, stop! I want him alive,\" I immediately shouted, just before the volley was unleashed.\n\"We know you have a servant of the Lady in your custody,\" said the duke. \"For her freedom, I challenge any Imperial knight willing to face me in a duel.\"\nI walked among my men.\n\"Does anyone accept the challenge? No one? No knights among you?\" the Bretonnian insisted, visibly irritated.\n\"No one feels like fighting with a Grail knight,\" I replied, not taking my eyes off him.\n\"It honors me that you confuse me with one of the Chosen,\" he replied solemnly. \"But I am still in search of the Grail. I have not received its blessing… Do you accept or not?\"\n\"Let's see… if I fight you and win, what do I get? Because you clearly win if you leave with your sorceress,\" I said, placing my hand on the hilt of my sword.\n\"You will be able to collect a ransom for my capture,\" said the duke.\n\"Deal,\" I replied, hiding my smile beneath my helmet.\n\"My lord, allow me. I think I can beat him,\" said one of my bodyguards.\n\"Relax,\" I told him. \"This guy won't be able to keep up with me.\"\nI drew my runic sword and showed it to the duke.\n\"May the Lady witness this duel and protect the noblest of the two,\" said the duke, getting into position.\n\"Yes, yes… whatever you say,\" I replied disinterestedly.\nSeeing that I wasn't using a shield, the duke set his aside. Grave mistake. That would have given him a chance against what I was planning to do to him.\nWe were surrounded in a silent circle. I began the fight with simple cuts, measuring distances. It was evident that the duke had more technique. The way he moved, how he placed weight into each strike, how he anticipated... he was better with the sword than I was.\nHe began to press, forcing me to retreat. I remained on the defensive, dodging or deflecting the blows.\nBut I didn't plan on beating him with elegance.\nWhen he raised his sword to search for a gap in my defense, I blocked his sword and lunged. I slid across the ground, knocked him off his feet, and landed on him, all my weight directly on his chest. I didn't give him time to react. I wrapped one leg around his neck and the other around his arm, applying pressure to his torso.\nI caught his arm, twisted his elbow against the joint, and with a quick hip movement, forced the lock. His arm cracked. A horrible sound, and the duke screamed like a condemned soul when I broke his arm, and that was music to my ears.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ\nI could have ended it there, but it wasn't enough. I went for the second arm. I looked at him. He gritted his teeth, some tears falling from his eyes. I paused for a second... such a shame... I grabbed my sword from the ground and placed it under his armpit, right at a gap in his armor.\n\"Yield,\" I said, uninterested in continuing.\n\"Never. A knight of the Kingdom of Bretonnia… never yields,\" he said. He reached for his sword with his good hand, stretching to grab it until his fist closed around the hilt.\nI stepped on the blade with force, making the metal screech against the stone.\n\"Don't make me break your other arm.\"\nBut the bastard kept trying. He gritted his teeth, tensed his neck, stretched to reach the hilt. He didn't even have strength left in his hand, but he insisted. Stubborn as a mule.\n\"You piece of shit… you brought this on yourself,\" I said angrily.\nI let out a snort. I grabbed his sword and threw it far, out of his reach. Then I threw mine too. I wouldn't need it for what was coming next.\nI grabbed his broken arm, the one he could barely move. I twisted it roughly, using the pain as an anchor, as leverage to destabilize him. The scream was automatic, involuntary, and his body opened just enough. I knocked him down again. I landed on top of him, knee to his chest, feeling the air escape from him.\nWith one hand, I held his neck. With the other, I drew the dagger he had at his belt and cut the straps of his helmet, one by one. I pulled off the helmet, exposing his face.\n\"So, handsome, huh?\" I said with a twisted smile. \"Let's see what your wife says when I'm done with you.\"\nAnd I began to strike him.\nWith a closed fist. I didn't stop hitting him, not when he started choking on his own blood, not when he tried to cover himself with his good arm. I shoved him to the ground, grabbed his wrist, and kept punching with the other hand. Punch after punch. One to the forehead. Another to the cheek. One straight to the cheekbone that sounded like it cracked. I felt the crunch of a tooth under my knuckles.\nThe blood splattered, hot. Every time he breathed, he spat more. I hit him until his body stopped moving. He was still breathing, but unresponsive.\nOnly then did I grip his neck tightly, leaning over his ear.\n\"Yield,\" I said, tired of hitting him.\nHe barely opened his eyes. One was closed from swelling, the other half open, flooded with blood tears. It was hard for him to speak. When he managed, he said it with a broken, weak voice, still full of defiance.\n\"Ne... ne... never...\"\nHe spat blood, this time just a red thread sliding down his chin, staining me with his blood.\n\"I don't have all day, I have a battle to win,\" I said, standing up and grabbing him by his black hair and part of his armor to drag him toward my men.\nThe duke's knights reacted instantly, drawing their swords.\n\"The duel isn't over! It's to the death!\" one of them yelled angrily.\n\"The duel is over because I say so,\" I replied, dropping the duke like a sack of potatoes as I fell to the ground, standing straight.\nI raised my hand.\"FIRE!\"\nIt didn't take long to hear the roar. All of the duke's knights fell to pieces under a volley of lead. Their armor clattered as their bodies hit the ground, and the blood mixed with the mud.\nWe tied the duke's body next to that of his dear damsel. \"Take them to the camp,\" I ordered. \"This prisoner and bodys are too valuable to drag them to the front.\"\nWith the duel finished and victory assured, we regrouped. \"Let's move,\" I said, pointing toward the rest of the captured duke's forces.\nThe fight continued, and we joined the fray as quickly as we could. Apparently, the Grail knights had already been eliminated, but at a high price. I saw the shattered bodies of several Imperial ogres among the corpses of the blessed steeds… so it wasn't easy.\nWe went straight to the front, and spent almost an entire hour annihilating the men-at-arms who were still offering resistance. They didn't want to retreat. They fought like damned souls, though they no longer had direction or hope. But with the close fire of the arquebuses, my musketeers, and the artillery that kept booming, the army of Montfort began to give way. Soon they broke. They fled like dogs, disorganized, trying to reach the safety of their fortress.\nWhen the battle finally ended, and the shouts for loot began, I went to find the Imperial general. I wanted to speak with him directly, to secure my share of the glory. I made my way through the center ranks, walking between Imperial and Bretonnian corpses, and asked for him.\nAll I found was his assistant.\n\"The general died a few minutes after the battle began, baron,\" the man said, nervously.\n\"What? How?\" I asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\"We had to use the cannons to stop the Grail knights… and well, one of the poorly calibrated shots hit him squarely.\"\nI put my hand to my face, pressing my lips together to keep from bursting into laughter.\n\"Are you telling me we killed the general... with our own cannon?\" I said, unable to believe it.\nThe assistant nodded silently.\n\"Shit… what an... Imperial way to die,\" I murmured, unable to hide a grin.\nBefore I could say anything else, a shout rose from among our ranks.\n\"Bretonnian reinforcements on the left!\"\nI turned immediately. From the not-so-steep slopes of the mountain, a new group of knights descended at full speed.\n\"Ah, come on...\" I sighed as I adjusted my belt. \"Still want to keep bleeding?\"\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

But we're fine... we could advance, capture Monfort, and complete the general's plan,\" he replied, following me closely, visibly nervous.\n\"And then what?\" I asked without stopping. \"Do you really think the Bretonnians are going to sit idly by while we take one of their most important fortresses? As soon as we set foot inside, they'll harass us relentlessly. Day and night. Not to mention if we don't get reinforcements in time. They'll kill us by starvation, exhaustion, or sheer persistence.\"\n\"But if we manage to take it and consolidate, it's almost certain the Emperor will send Imperial regiments to reinforce the position… especially if the Bretonnian duchies start fighting each other over internal disputes,\" he insisted.\nI stopped and looked at him sideways, raising an eyebrow.\"And why would they fight each other right now, when a foreign invader gives them the perfect reason to unite?\"\n\"Because many of their nobles are tainted,\" he replied in a low voice. \"Vampirism. Chaos influence. The corruption runs deep, more than we thought. Our collaborator, Sir Artrenic of Fandramanc, obtained concrete evidence. Documents, testimonies. Everything will be delivered to the Emperor. Once Monfort is under Imperial control, the clergy of Sigmar can declare a holy war. And if everything goes as expected… Bretonnia could fall from within.\"\nI stayed silent for a few seconds, processing the weight of what I had just heard.\n\"So that's why Monfort was so important,\" I murmured. \"Not for its walls per se,but for its routes… because from here we could exert pressure on the duchies while they tear each other apart searching for those bearing the stain.\"\n\"We have a big problem then...\" I responded without taking my eyes off the hill. \"How are we supposed to coordinate anything if we have cavalry charging at us while our men are busy looting corpses?\"\nThe scene in front of us was clear: a group of Bretonnian knights was charging at full gallop, lances at the ready, directly toward the men who were scavenging the bodies from the field.\n\"We have to fight. They're not that many,\" replied the assistant.\nThe general's assistant nodded slowly.\n\"That's why we must continue. Now we have the chance to end this mockery of knights,\" he said with conviction, not taking his eyes off the battlefield.\n\"Well, then we have quite a big problem…\" I said, watching as a new Bretonnian charge descended the hill, straight for the Imperial soldiers looting the bodies. \"How are we supposed to coordinate anything if we don't even have control over our lines, and they're busy scavenging corpses?\"\n\"They're not that many. We can face them,\" the assistant insisted, trying to sound confident.\n\"What, a thousand? A thousand two hundred?\" I asked, without looking at him. \"The Bretonnians are convinced that any disaster can be solved with bravery. They don't understand the concept of retreat or military logic.\"\n\"Are you going to do nothing?\" he asked, almost incredulously, seeing how the knights began trampling the stragglers.\n\"Yes, yes, I'm going to save those nobles' asses,\" I said, walking toward my men.\nOnce under my command, I mobilized his men to the flank.\nThe Bretonnians were a reinforcement force, but poorly organized. They were probably sent by another duke who, for a change, only sent cavalry.\nThey pursued the looters without order, crossing hills, slopes, and clearings… until they ran straight into a natural trap: open ground with good visibility from where all our artillery could operate without obstacles.\nNo need to give many orders.\nCannon fire. Closed volleys. A storm of lead that consumed the Bretonnians.\nThe Bretonnian ranks broke. Many were trapped in crossfire. Those who survived the bombardment were struck by the noble troops who, seeing their loot in danger, finally regrouped.\nThe combat lasted just a few minutes. The remaining Bretonnians fled back to Monfort. Their attempt at reinforcement was a complete disaster.\nI was surprised by how pathetic the reinforcement was… And to think the Duke of Monfort had at least managed to outnumber us... though, of course, using peasants with wooden spears.\nThe nobles followed the knights, and for the unfortunate Bretonnians, the defenders of Monfort didn't open the gates, so the defenders could only witness how the knights sent to their aid were massacred beneath their walls… well, they had archers, so they tried to help by harassing, but a peasant archer leaves much to be desired with their aim.\nAfter the Bretonnian reinforcements were annihilated, an emergency meeting was called. All the nobles still alive were summoned to the central tent, the same one where the general used to impose his will without discussion.\nThe problem was simple, but serious: who would lead now?\nIf they chose some fanatic with delusions of glory, someone who insisted on continuing the siege of Monfort, we were doomed. If the siege lasted more than a week, with insufficient provisions and morale plummeting, we would wear ourselves out to collapse. On the other hand, retreating now was the safest option… but it also meant losing the best chance to severely weaken Bretonnia.\nAnd more importantly: losing the opportunity to force the Bretonnian nobles to purge the highest ranks of their nobility, infested by the corruption of Chaos and vampirism. The simple fact that some knights had considered negotiating with us on that matter… said a lot about how rotten their kingdom was.\nLuckily, there were no high-ranking nobles in the meeting. Most were lower-ranking knights with their personal forces or second sons without real voice. Everything indicated that the expedition had been funded almost exclusively by the general. That explained why the other nobles only brought a handful of men each. Either the truly important ones had died… or I was the only one with some weight that the general had managed to influence before he died.\nWith the chaos momentarily contained, I took advantage of the time. I used the little gold I had left from buying captured Bretonnian horses and, with that as collateral, I rehired the mercenary companies that had previously answered to the general. Now they answered to me. Around three thousand men, to whom I owed more than I could pay... for now.\nI then moved among the captains of the state regiments. They were soldiers from Reikland, recruited by the general himself. I sat with them, promised generous pay, ample loot, and priority in the distribution, if they formally recognized me as the leader of the expedition. and It worked. I added another two thousand soldiers to my ranks.\nI now had control of nearly half the army. And considering the recent losses, I could operate as if I commanded half of the original force. While the other nobles tried to bribe each other, making empty promises to win support... I had already won.\nIn the command tent, the atmosphere was a boiling cauldron. Everyone was talking at once, claiming legitimacy, demanding votes, pointing to lineages and rights.\n\"Alright, calm down! Calm down, everyone!\" shouted the assistant of the late general, trying to impose some order.\nI just watched.\nMost of these men didn't have the resources or the backing to hold the command beyond this tent. But they knew Monfort was within reach. If we played our cards right, if we acted quickly, the city could fall.\nApparently, there were few defenders left inside the walls. The exterior battle had left them isolated, with the gates closed, unable to receive more help.\nTaking it, looting it, emptying the duke's coffers, and leaving with gold and prestige... that was what truly interested me.\nWhile the nobles kept arguing among themselves—fighting over who had the oldest lineage or which family had more influence—I simply looked at the general's assistant. I no longer had the patience to keep wasting time.\n\"ALRIGHT! Let's end this nonsense!\" I shouted loudly, raising my voice over the commotion. The tent fell silent.\n\"While you've been throwing titles at each other's faces, while you've been counting how many generations you've carried a crest on your cloaks... I made sure to secure the only thing that matters: the military support of the soldiers.\"\nI paused. Everyone looked at me.\n\"The situation is simple. I have the backing of the majority of the army. And if anyone has a complaint... we can settle it the way nobles do—with swords.\"\nI unsheathed my runic sword and raised it calmly.\n\"Like the beating I gave to the Duke of Monfort when he challenged me. Does anyone else want to follow his example?\" I said, looking at all the nobles.\nAbsolute silence. Only tense glances, some filled with hate, others with fear.\n\"No one... great?\" I said, slowly sheathing my sword, scanning the faces of those present. All minor nobles. None important. None with the numbers to face me.\nThen one spoke up. A man i knew he was vassal to the Margrave.\"You're just a child,\" he said with a hard look, as if his words were enough to intimidate me.\n\"Is that a yes to the duel?\" I asked without changing my tone, locking eyes with him.\n\"You hide behind your runic sword,\" he replied. \"Without it, you're nothing.\"\nI smiled. Not kindly.\n\"I also have a runic chainmail,\" I said, raising an eyebrow. \"But since we're here, tell me… was that a yes to the duel or are you going to swallow your words… like the damn coward you are?\" I shouted with a firm voice, projecting every syllable like a slap.\nThe murmur in the tent disappeared completely. Some lowered their gazes. Others waited to see if the noble would stand up… or swallow his pride.\nIn the end, the noble who had challenged me decided it wasn't worth dying for pride. He lowered his head, swallowing his words in front of everyone.\n\"Anyone else opposed to me being the leader?\" I asked, sweeping my gaze across the inside of the tent.\nTotal silence.\n\"No… great?\" I said, smiling as I sheathed my runic sword.\nWith leadership secured by force and pressure, I wasted no time. I personally presented myself before the walls of Monfort with a white flag, while I ordered the camp to be set up right in front of the city. The soldiers drove stakes, dug trenches, aligned cannons. Everything as if we were truly planning a prolonged siege.\nI went to offer them surrender with all the formality war demands. I assured them that, if they surrendered the city, we would release the captured duke and allow the local nobility to keep their dignity. It was a reasonable proposal.\nOf course, they rejected it without hesitation.\nThe knights still inside, despite the massacre outside, were convinced they could hold out. They believed they were safe behind their five layers of walls and their towers, which were impossible to scale. They were waiting for reinforcements. Or simply clinging to the arrogance typical of their caste.\nWhat they didn't know… was that I had already decided how I would enter.\nThat night, while the Bretonnians slept or attended to their wounded, I gathered my trusted troops. Not a single torch was lit. We moved in complete silence under the shadow of the walls.\nIt was, without a doubt, the greatest and most risky use of Chamon I had ever done.\nUsing my affinity with metal, I located the internal mechanisms of the drawbridge and the main gates. With extreme care, I activated the gears from the outside, shifting the levers with the minimum amount winds of chamon necessary. To the Imperial eyes accompanying me, I had kept my word: the Bretonnians had traitors within their ranks.\nAnd to the Bretonnians' eyes… someone had betrayed them from within.\nAs we advanced through the first level of the city-fortress of Monfort, we encountered groups of men-at-arms emerging from houses, half-dressed, poorly armed, with faces that made it clear that, just moments ago, they had been asleep, unaware of what was happening.\nI took a few steps forward, raised a hand in a slow gesture, and spoke with the best formal Bretonnian pronunciation my education could mimic.\n\"Brave warriors of Bretonnia,\" I said \"I wish you no harm. Your leaders have surrendered the city. I ask you — in the name of honor — to lay down your weapons and surrender your armor. Fulfill the duty that your noble lords have already accepted. Let us not shed more unnecessary blood.\"\nI presented myself elegantly, calmly, as if this were a ceremony and not an undercover conquest operation. The Bretonnians looked at each other, still groggy, unable to comprehend how Imperial soldiers could walk within their walls without signs of combat.\nIt didn't take long before they began dropping their swords to the ground.\nFirst a few… then many more. Most were commoners. They had no instructions or context. They only knew to obey. And if someone in armor, with a firm voice and noble manners, told them that their superiors had surrendered, they didn't hesitate. They obeyed.\nThus, much of the resistance vanished without the need for violence.\nSome groups didn't fall for the trap, of course. But they were isolated, poorly equipped, and surprised. Their response was pathetic. Shouts of confusion, a few weak arrows fired… nothing that stopped our advance.\nAs panic spread through their ranks, with no one knowing how the gates had opened or who had let us in, we continued level by level.\nThe garrison had made the classic mistake: concentrating almost all their strength on the first level of defense. And since almost everyone dropped their weapons, believing that the surrender was real... we took them by surprise.\nWe secured the lower level in minutes. We sealed all the exits. No one entered. No one left.\nThe upper levels, more residential and administrative, were nearly empty. They fell one after another like dominoes. There was no organized resistance. Just a few servants armed with splintered spears, and not a single competent officer attempting to regroup the troops.\nEach floor taken was another step toward the keep.\nThere, as expected, the last stronghold: a small group of Bretonnian knights, entrenched, as stubborn as stones, refusing to surrender even with the city completely lost.\nBut they were few.\nAnd the door to the keep — luckily for me — was wide open. Perhaps by confusion. Perhaps by desperation. Or perhaps… by my intervention minutes earlier.\nWe entered without the need for a siege. The combat was brief. A dozen knights against a hundred of mine, all well-armed and with a total advantage.\nMonfort belonged to the Empire.\nAnd its riches... were mine.\nI took the precaution of not killing the captured duke. I kept him alive for a clear reason: if the Empire didn't send reinforcements, if things went awry and Bretonnians from other duchies managed to reclaim the city, I could always use him as a bargaining chip.\nA quick negotiation, a convenient exchange… and I could leave Monfort with my pockets full of gold and my head still on my shoulders.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Not figuratively. Literally saturated. There was so much Chamon in the air that I couldn't ignore it. I could feel the energy of the metal vibrating beneath my feet, trembling with every breath. I refused to wait. I needed to go to court to see the courtiers waiting to know who I had as a hostage, but I couldn't resist the call of Chamon and entered the treasury.\nIngots. Piles of gold ingots stacked one on top of the other. Piles and piles, as if someone had organized them to build a wall. Wooden boxes filled to the brim with Bretonnian coins, many sealed with royal seals. There were open chests, barrels of silver counted by the hundreds.\n\"The damn duke was obscenely rich… damn… and here I thought I was already rich,\" I muttered, slowly spinning on my heels, looking all around.\nThe silence of my men spoke volumes. They were frozen. Some with glazed eyes, others with nervous smiles, as if they expected all of this to be a dream.\nI approached them and placed my hands on their shoulders, one by one.\n\"If we get home alive… boys, we're all going to have enough to spend freely. I promise you,\" I said with a smile I couldn't hide.\nI knew some of my men would die before returning home. I accepted it with the same certainty that I knew, to maintain Monfort, I was going to need a series of miracles.\nThe Bretonnian tide wouldn't be long in coming.\nWith a bit of luck, the five messengers I sent to Altdorf would make it without issues. If they succeed, if the bureaucrats move at the speed of war instead of the slowness of a court, we might get reinforcements soon. Because defending this citadel with only thirteen thousand men—state regiments, mercenaries, and personal troops—would be problematic.\nVery problematic.\nLuckily, we have the sturdy walls of Monfort. Unlike its former owner, I won't make the mistake of leaving the walls behind to seek a glorious fight in the field. I won't underestimate anyone.\nFinally, after soaking in the aura of Chamon that filled the treasury, I forced myself to leave.\nI climbed the stairs leading to the fourth floor, toward the duke's court.\nIt was a grand hall, decorated with stained glass, tapestries of ancient campaigns, and the heraldry of Bretonnian noble houses. There, the courtiers awaited me. Dozens of them. Many were young women, well-dressed ladies adorned with necklaces, rings, silks...\nThe few men present were barely boys, squires, or young men who hadn't yet wielded a lance outside the training yard. The true knights of Monfort were all out of action: either dead, riddled with imperial lead, or locked in some cell, waiting for their surname to be worth more alive than dead.\nMy eyes stopped on the throne.\nIt was surrounded by a woman of firm bearing, with the Monfort House crest on her chest. Around her, several children, all well-dressed, all silent. Some hid behind her when they saw me enter. Others circled her as if she could protect them from the inevitable.\nAll eyes were on me as I walked through the hall, alone, with no escort, like a judge entering a courtroom where the verdict had already been delivered.\nThe woman looked at me with a mixture of fear and poorly concealed hatred.\n\"Are you… the imperial general?\" she asked in a poorly pronounced Reikspiel, barely understandable due to her heavy accent.\n\"Yes,\" I replied calmly, smiling slightly. \"We can speak your language if you understand me. I express myself quite fluently in your tongue,\" I added in clean French, without an imperial accent.\n\"My husband… the Duke of Monfort…\" she said, swallowing hard. \"He didn't return from the battlefield. Is he… alive?\"\n\"Yes,\" I responded calmly. \"Though stubborn as a mule, he tried to die in battle. It'll take him a while to admit it for the moment.\"\n\"What happened to him?\" she asked, unable to hide the fear beginning to weigh in her voice.\n\"He challenged a young imperial who didn't even have a knight's title,\" I said as I walked toward the throne with slow, measured steps. \"And well… they broke his face to pieces.\"\nI sat in the throne as if it were mine by right, without ceremony. I settled comfortably, as if I had always belonged there.\n\"My husband would never do something so dishonorable as to challenge someone incapable of defending himself,\" the woman said, clearly offended, with clenched fists and pursed lips.\n\"My dear lady,\" I replied, resting an elbow on the throne's armrest and my chin on my hand, relaxed. \"Before you stands the young imperial who broke your husband's face. With this very gauntlet, I broke his nose. With these hands, I shattered his arm. And no matter how many times I offered him surrender, again and again, he refused.\"\nThe entire room fell silent.\n\"So, if you think about it... your husband seemed very determined to die that day. You can consider me a benefactor. I saved his life.\" I said with a smile.\nThe woman parted her lips, closed her eyes, and breathed heavily.\n\"I know that now your family has no way of paying his ransom, but we'll talk about that later, my lady,\" I said, not getting up from the throne, my voice calm but firm. \"As for the rest… I want each of you, if you belong to a noble house, to give me in writing how much your relatives paid — or would pay — for your release.\"\nI paused, letting the words sink into the silence.\n\"Bring one of your servants, if you have any left. I'll use them to send the ransom messages. Once the gold is received… I will release them as it's rightfully due.\"\nThe nobles moved instantly. Some clumsily. Others resigned. They asked for pen and parchment. They began writing. The sound of quills on paper filled the room for a moment, as if each stroke were a reminder of their new condition.\nI read each sheet attentively. Name by name, figure by figure. No sign of a ducal house. No important heirs. A shame. I would have loved to have one of the dukes' children.\nWhen I finished, I looked up.\n\"Who among you handles the Duke's finances?\" I asked, without raising my voice.\nThree men raised their hands. From their clothes, they weren't nobles. Commoners, probably administrators. Well-fed. With clean hands. Exactly the kind of men who count coins.\nI gestured for them to approach.\n\"Start counting all the gold and silver in the treasury. Ingot by ingot, chest by chest. I want to know the exact size of my new fortune.\"\n\"Keep an eye on them,\" I ordered one of my bodyguards, stationed at the entrance. He met my gaze and nodded.\nI turned toward the Duke's wife.\n\"My lady,\" I said with a minimal bow. \"I will assign you a task. With the help of my men, you will gather all the valuable items from your house: family relics, historical goods, emblems from generations. I don't care if they are sacred or sentimental. I want them identified and classified.\"\nShe opened her mouth, but said nothing.\n\"And if there are items from the Cult of the Lady… they will be respected under the right of conquest. I won't touch them, but I request your cooperation to avoid future problems. Because all indications are that I'll be here for quite some time.\"\nI began to walk toward the exit of the throne room.\nThe woman didn't respond.\nI gestured to two of my bodyguards to \"motivate\" her to cooperate. They approached her silently.\nWith the noble hostages under control, I turned my attention to my real business: the city and the army.\nI issued precise orders to all the men under my command, focusing on vigilance. I met with the remnants of the Duke's men-at-arms. Many were downhearted, wounded, or simply confused. But they responded honestly. They pointed out how patrols were organized, shifts, vulnerable points. Useful details. At least the Bretonnians were honest in that regard. Even when defeated.\nNext, I spoke with some prisoners among the reinforcements who had arrived too late.\nThat's when I received some rather… amusing news.\nApparently, my metal traps had worked.\nWhen the Duke of Parravon led his reinforcement charge toward Monfort, proudly riding his pegasus, he himself stepped on one of the caltrops hidden in the field. And he wasn't the only one. Dozens of horses stepped on the traps at the same time. At full speed. The chaos was absolute. Horses falling, riders crushed, wild animals colliding with each other. No one could react.\nThe charge disintegrated before they even saw the enemy.\nThe Duke of Parravon survived… with a broken arm, a shattered leg, and his pride shattered. He had to return to his castle, escorted by most of the reinforcements that were supposed to save Monfort.\nI couldn't help but laugh.Thɪs ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nThe same ones who came to lift the siege ended up fleeing without having drawn a single sword.\nI coordinated many of my troops to begin setting up guard shifts and fortifying the obvious points of containment, trying to protect our escape routes as much as possible. I ordered some bridges connecting Monfort to the rest of Bretonnia to be burned and established a forward base at Juinard and Hochpoint with some troops to prevent the Bretonnians from trying to cut off our communication with the Empire by attacking messengers.\nI also sent patrols to attempt to take the local castles of Monfort, which should be almost defenseless after sending most of their troops to this battle. I especially wanted to secure the gold mines, as much of the Duke's income came from that source, along with trade. As long as I control this place, even temporarily, I'll squeeze everything I can out of it before the Bretonnians manage to form an army to reclaim it, which should take a month or two, if we're lucky.\nWith much more luck, the Emperor will send reinforcements. But until then, there's nothing to do but wait. As much as I'd like to run off with all that's already on my hands, the issue is how the hell to move all the gold and silver here without needing more than one trip.\nBecause yes, I absolutely had to go personally to Helmgart to make sure they let us pass. I wouldn't doubt for a second that the Margrave would try to play me and seize the gold. This amount of wealth is enough to change lives… I could spend gold on so many things I've always wanted, but since I spend at the same rate I earn, I can only afford a few projects at a time. So I can't afford the luxury of slowly withdrawing it, only to be surprised by the Margrave already requisitioning it all.\n\"Well… I'll see what else I can steal that isn't nailed to the ground… the peasants,\" I said with a smile.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Both were tough bastards—huge masses of muscle who knew how to use every bit of their strength. The difference was, this baron was much more diplomatic. His father preferred to settle things with fists or brute force.\nApparently, he managed to convince the nobles that it was better for him to take temporary command while we waited for the proper Imperial chain of command to handle the corpse of our last general.\nSomething tells me that poor bastard must've really pissed off his men to get himself killed by such a badly aimed cannon shot. Word is, there wasn't much left to hand over to Morr.\nWhen the baron took command, I thought it meant we'd be packing up and heading home. Because taking Monfort's walls would've been suicide, no matter how you looked at it. So many layers of walls… and with just twelve cannons, we wouldn't be able to break through even the first without the Bretonnians swarming us from every side.\nBut with the same stubbornness as his father, the baron decided we were going to lay siege anyway.\nAnd I'd thought he was smart…\nWe made every preparation: set up camp, pitched the tents, built a palisade, and lined up the cannons facing the walls of Monfort.\nThe rest of the day we just rested. Everyone took the chance to relax a bit, especially after the recent victory in battle—and to squabble over the loot. Meanwhile, the baron tried—unsuccessfully—to get the Bretonnians to open the gates.\nAs night was falling, the baron suddenly began mobilizing everyone, ordering us to form ranks like always.\n\"All right, men… the Bretonnians have agreed to surrender and will open the gates. So form up, get your gear, we'll be marching through Monfort,\" the baron said with the smile of a man already tasting victory.\nWe started marching after him, still not quite understanding what was going on. As far as we knew, the Bretonnians hadn't surrendered. And as we approached the massive walls, we saw some shadows—likely guards—moving erratically. But after a few moments… they were gone. No more movement. No one watching us from the ramparts.\nAll the way to the walls, there wasn't a single soul in sight.\nAnd then, just like the baron said… the gates began to open. The wooden drawbridge lowered, and the second barrier—a thick iron gate—rose into the air.\n\"Let's go, lads… we've got something to conquer,\" said the baron, grinning even wider.\nThe passage was completely empty. It was just the toll station. We followed the road up a staircase to a heavy iron door—it was already open, and we passed through without issue.\nWhile we waited for everyone to ascend, I took a few men to secure the gate mechanisms so we wouldn't be trapped inside. But all we found were the guards—most of them purple in the face, with dark bruises around their necks. As if someone had strangled them with immense force.\nI left some men guarding the doors and followed the baron. That's when we found the night's first enemies: a large number of Bretonnians were coming out of their homes, armed with swords and mail—but not all of them. Many didn't even have their armor on. It was strange.\nWe were about to charge when the baron began speaking in Bretonnian.\nAnd just like that, they dropped their swords.\nWithin moments, they were throwing their armor to the ground too—right outside their homes. Then they shut their doors.\nMy fellow soldiers and I stood speechless. Hundreds of men had surrendered without a fight.\nThis happened three more times. The baron spoke, and the Bretonnians surrendered.\nSome of our men gathered their swords and armor, piling them in a square.\nWe kept moving. The next level's gates were already open again.\nOn the third level, we finally met some resistance. But there were so few of them. Only one looked like a knight—the rest had only swords and cloth tunics. The fight was over in seconds. I swung my greatsword once and took off two heads. The baron drove his sword into the knight's neck, pushing it all the way in and pulling it out soaked in blood.\nThe rest were cut down by our men.\nWe continued to the fourth level, where we faced a bit more resistance—about twenty knights. But then we brought in the musketeers, and the knights were left full of holes.\nFinally, we reached the fifth and highest level, where the keep tower was.\nThe door was open. A group of knights was trying to close it, but failing. When they saw us, they drew their swords—but once again, the musketeers made quick work of them. We entered the fortress.\nThe rest of the city was taken in silence. Every so often we heard the crack of a musket, but it was over in minutes.\nWe had taken the fortress that everyone said would take months to bring down.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I renewed their contract for two more months, paying upfront with a handful of ingots. Barely a small dent in the vast reserves of the Bretonnian duke, but enough to keep that pack useful, at least while they were still well-fed and feared losing their pay.\nI also gave a general advance to my own state troops. I wanted everyone to feel the weight of the metal in their hands. A motivation as old as war itself. I paid them in Bretonnian coins, but I doubted any of them would protest; after all, once in the Empire, those gold and silver coins would be worth as much as ours, and the money changers don't ask questions when the weight is good.\nI still didn't have an exact figure of how much gold I had gathered. What I did know was that there was too much to evacuate all at once. There was so much wealth that I constantly found myself repeating that I should stay a little longer, resist a bit more, even when everything inside me screamed that I should take whatever I could and leave before fate claimed me for the audacity of taking Monfort.\nFor now, everything was calm. The bridges that connected the city to the heart of Bretonnia had been burned. Our communication route with the Empire was secured, at least for the moment. Some groups of knights were roaming the roads, trying to harass our messengers or assess our defenses, but I had them well covered. The mercenaries, especially the ogres, were patrolling the routes. Those monsters have excellent scent: they can smell a horse from kilometers away… or the man riding it. The Bretonnians weren't subtle, and my hounds hunted them down like it was sport.\nI just hoped they didn't end up cooking the riders too, because with me inside the fortress, I had no way to supervise every pot those bastards put on the fire.\nEven with the war in full swing, commerce didn't stop. Monfort was a vital hub in the Bretonnian trade routes. Many merchants still arrived, even knowing that the city was under Imperial control. For them, the important thing was crossing. Some came from the west, heading to Parravon, others from the east seeking access to our lands. As long as the passage remained open and the guards didn't demand absurd tributes, the merchants would keep coming like rats after cheese.\nAnd money… flowed.\nMore silver than gold, of course. The ridiculous Bretonnian legislation prohibited peasants from using gold, as if touching it was a right reserved for the nobles. Hence, there were so many barrels filled with silver coins: that's how the merchants paid their taxes, and that's how I was now financing my occupation.\nWhen I finished dispatching the last of the messengers, I went down to the second level of the fortress, the residential area of Monfort.\nMuch of it was occupied by artisans: blacksmiths, tanners, shoemakers, people who lived from daily work and metal. Those who shaped what was needed in a fortified city. But between the alleyways and streets further from the urban core, I began to notice something different.\nThere were whole groups that didn't fit in with the rest. Torn clothing, bare feet, bodies hunched as if trying to disappear. Peasants. Many. More than I thought possible inside the walls.\nI approached one of those groups, sheltered in a distant alley. I stopped and watched them silently for a few seconds before speaking.\n\"And what are you doing here, not working?\" I asked, frowning, looking directly at the cluster of crouched figures.\nThey all looked up as if they had heard the cry of an executioner in a public square. They shrank between themselves, trying to disappear behind one another's shoulder.\nOne of them, a man as thin as a stalk, with a sun-scorched face and feet covered in sores, replied while lowering his head.\n\"We're waiting for our duke to give us permission to return to our lands… sir,\" he said, looking at me with reddened eyes.\n\"Do you know your duke is a prisoner, right?\" I said without breaking eye contact, while noticing there were many more hiding in the shadows.\nI took a step forward and frowned. \"Have you eaten anything?\"\nThere was a moment of silence. Then, some shook their heads. I looked closer and saw children huddled among the adults. Some barely had the strength to raise their eyes. One of them had his eyes open but wasn't blinking. Another, a girl with a dress hanging like rags, was pressing her hand to her stomach with an almost automatic gesture.\nI had to turn away.\nI withdrew from there without saying anything more. I felt a pressure in my chest, as if something inside me had broken for a moment.\n\"Are you feeling well, my lord??\" one of my guards asked worriedly.\n\"Just bad memories,\" I said, trying to compose myself.\nI climbed to the third level of the fortress. I wasted no time. I went straight to the main stores.\nThe fortress of Monfort had large underground facilities for storing provisions, I already knew that. But I wasn't prepared for what I found when I opened the reinforced doors of the castle's food storage.\nThe place was overflowing.\nMountains of grain sacks piled up to the ceiling. In another room, shelves packed with cured cheeses. Beyond that, a chamber with hams hanging in rows, perfectly preserved in brine. Entire hallways filled with barrels, sealed boxes, nets with onions and garlic, sacks of flour, jars of butter, dried herbs, and wine.\nIt was enough to feed an army for an entire year. And not just any army: a well-fed, satisfied one, without the need for rationing.\nI felt an involuntary spasm in my face, a twitch in my eye, as if a vein was about to burst. I clenched my fists tightly as I walked through the room in silence.\n\"And if I give the duke of Monfort the pleasure… of killing him,\" I whispered between my teeth, in a barely audible voice.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nIt was a storehouse worthy of an Imperial campaign or a crusade. And down there, just a few levels below, hundreds of peasants were rotting from hunger under the empty gaze of a castle bursting at the seams with food. Men and women with feet torn apart, children to the bones, the elderly waiting to die in the shadows of the alleyways.\nMy peasants lived like kings in comparison.\nBack in my land, I had never seen anything like this. And if a bad harvest ever came my way, I'd have to resign myself and buy food to help them, but this is ridiculous.\nBut here… the duke preferred to let his people die rather than touch his personal reserves.\nThere was enough to feed my troops, and there would still be plenty left over. They could eat three times a day without fear of exhausting the supplies. Additionally, merchants continued to arrive. Not as often as before, but regularly enough to keep the economy alive.\nI ordered some of my men to set up an improvised kitchen in the main square, right where the supply routes and access to the market intersected.\nThere was space in abundance. Stoves still set up by the artisans. Water in nearby wells. Firewood stacked in sheds. In less than an hour, the first pots started to boil.\nIt wasn't long before the crowd arrived.\nThey approached in silence. Some could barely walk, others carried children with dull eyes… Only the sound of feet against stone.\nWe gave them bread. We gave them thick soup, with some cured meat. The necessary amount to allow them to breathe one more day without collapsing on the street. It was easier to govern a city without dead bodies piling up in the corners.\nBretonnian culture was pushing me to the edge.\nHow could such a rotten, useless system still stand? In the Empire, a noble is considered cruel if they collect taxes during a bad harvest. Here, on the other hand, it seemed to be mandatory. Starve the peasant. Let children die on the roads while knights parade around on steeds that eat better than half the village.\nI had plenty of reasons to sharpen the executioner's blade. To start rolling heads crowned with flowers of the Grail. Or, better yet, lock them in their own dungeons and let them feel in their stomachs what the living skeletons I found in the alleyways felt.\nIf I executed them, if I humiliated them openly, I would be breaking any chance of future negotiation. And, more importantly, I'd risk having the rest of the Bretonnian nobles close the doors to my retreat. Because this — as much as it pained me to admit it — was plunder disguised as occupation. I wasn't here to stay. I was here to take everything I could carry… and leave.\nWhile my men served hot soup and handed out freshly baked bread, a large crowd began to gather in the central square. First came the most desperate: women with emaciated children in their arms, elderly who could barely stand. Then came the men, dignity shattered but eyes still filled with rage. And later, those who hadn't eaten in days, but still hid out of fear, shame, or habit.\nWhile the peasants sat to eat under the wary eyes of the local merchants and artisans — who watched them as if they were rats emerging from the sewers — I climbed onto an old wooden crate and spoke in a firm voice, projecting it across the square without needing to shout.\n\"Know this,\" I said, as I scanned the hunched crowd, \"it doesn't always have to be like this.\"\nThe murmurs quieted. The spoons stopped moving for a few seconds.\n\"For now, you're under Imperial occupation. That means that — at least for a time — you are part of the Empire. You no longer have to bow your heads to the same rotting nobility that treated you as if you were filth. Those bastards who forced you to leave your fields, who prohibited you from carrying arms, who tore the bread from your hands with taxes that even the worst nobles in the Empire wouldn't dare charge.\"\nI saw some lift their eyes. Very few. But they were there. Eyes filled with dirt, dark circles, dust… now showing a different spark. One I knew well: hope mixed with doubt.\n\"You are free to leave. No one will stop you. If any of you decide to leave this land and cross into the Empire, my men will protect your steps. There will be no tolls, no soldiers hitting you on the roads. I swear it by my status as an Imperial noble. And more than that…\"\nI paused and slowly stepped down from the crate, taking a few steps toward the center of the crowd. \"I offer you something else. Whoever wants to start anew, may do so. I invite you to my lands. There will be shelter. There will be land to cultivate. And there will be peace, as long as I breathe.\"\nI stayed silent for a few moments.\nThe murmurs returned, but they weren't the same. It wasn't just fearful whispers anymore.\nI saw how everyone began to speak among themselves, leaning toward each other, exchanging quick words as they threw glances at me that I wasn't sure were fear, doubt… or something more. Some avoided my gaze. Others couldn't stop looking at me. As if they were trying to decide whether they believed what they had just heard… or if they preferred to stay clinging to the old yoke.\nAt least I should try to bring them willingly… if I take them by force, they'll be much harder to make work.\nI lowered my gaze and returned to the pots. I helped stir the contents with a wooden spoon as large as my arm.\nSoon, I would have to return to the command room, write orders, prepare messages, and organize the patrols.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The second knight's armor crumpled like wet paper, and both fell to the ground motionless.\nThe ogre didn't stop. He lifted the first knight again, and used him as a bloody club against a third knight trying to escape on foot. He knocked him down with a single blow. The Bretonnian's helmet rolled down the hill.\nI watched in silence as the Grail seeker was turned into a bag of broken bones in the hands of a beast.\n\"Humans... soft... so many bones... fun to break,\" said the ogre, laughing while showing his disgusting teeth.\n\"Yeah, yeah... very nice,\" I replied, clapping my gauntlets while still leaning against a leaning tree.\n\"Can we eat the horses?\" murmured the Maneater leader close to my ear.\n\"Two,\" I answered, raising two fingers. \"The dead one and that other one, the thinner one.\" I didn't move a muscle.\n\"And the third?\" insisted the ogre. \"It's ours.\"\n\"I'll pay you in gold for it,\" I replied without taking my eyes off the field. \"That horse has good pedigree. With what I give you, you'll be able to buy enough meat for two days.\"\nThe ogre grunted, scratching his belly. \"I don't know... I'm starting to feel hungry... for human flesh.\"\n\"You want to die, ogre? Or would you rather keep earning well, filling your pockets with gold and your belly with food? I didn't object when you ate those dead horses I left you the other days,\" I said seriously, though not reacting to his provocation.\n\"Yeah... that soup was good. My belly was really full those days,\" said the Maneater in a more relaxed voice.\n\"Besides, I got you the fish you wanted. Or have you forgotten?\" I added, turning my head to look him straight in the eyes.\n\"Yeah... river fish... well with horse... in a stew... no... better roasted... I can already smell it,\" he said, licking his lips.\n\"Speaking of smelling something... do you smell that?\" I asked the ogre as I felt a metallic movement in the area, clearly knights.\nThe ogre sniffed audibly and began licking his lips exaggeratedly.\n\"Meat...\" murmured the Maneater leader, as the rest of the ogres began sniffing the air. They were already grabbing their heavy weapons, ready to go hunt more food.\nIn the few days we had been in Monfort, we had already secured most of the former duchy. Only a few castles in the mountains were still resisting. They were well-built fortresses, with garrisons that still held firm, and I couldn't afford to waste men on prolonged sieges. Those places would be the first to fall once the situation tilted in our favor.\nSo, we adopted a more aggressive approach while waiting for the Bretonnian response. This was one of our first direct incursions into Parravon's territory. Since their failed attempt to intervene in the battle, the presence of knights in the area had drastically decreased. But the most interesting thing was what we found: a Bretonnian camp where they were starting to gather men-at-arms and knights.\nI thought about being a thorn in their side, hidden in the shadows, to turn swords into lead or convert armor into a mass of giant steel, depending on how intense the winds of Chamon were\nAnd for that kind of work, there was no better tool than the ogres. Their immense strength and keen sense of smell allowed them to detect horses — and therefore knights — from great distances. I didn't even have to guide them like my own men. All I had to do was let them loose, and they would sniff the wind, grunt, and run straight at the enemy. They didn't care about glory or orders. They wanted meat. And above all, they wanted horses.\nOf course, they didn't like having me around while they ate. They knew that, if I was present, they couldn't devour humans. They respected me enough not to argue about it.\nTaking advantage of the fact that the ogres had left and I had no one watching me, I decided to move solo toward the Bretonnian camp, which was a few kilometers to the east.\nI spurred my horse hard and galloped, dodging trees and rocks as the cool morning breeze hit my face. Along the way, I crossed paths with three knights who were guarding the road, but they barely had time to understand what was coming at them. Their helmets snapped shut with a dry thud as they crashed to the ground, crushing their skulls as if they had fallen into bear traps. I didn't reduce my pace. I kept going while the ground trembled under the horseshoes, climbing the hills to get a better view.\nAnd there it was. A Bretonnian camp rising among the trees. At first glance, it seemed like they were preparing the place to receive all the levies they would be gathering for the campaign to retake Monfort. They were still few... and I hoped they would immediately travel to meet their king.\n\"Come on, how stupid can they be? This is too easy,\" I muttered with a smile before turning the horse around and riding back to Monfort.\nOn the way, I passed by the ogres, who were finishing tearing apart five young knights. The scene was grotesque: one of them had a horse impaled and spinning on a fire while laughing with his mouth full of grease.\n\"Let's go. Leave the bodies. We'll come back for them later,\" I ordered the Maneater leader.\nThe ogre looked at me while spinning the skewer. \"I'm hungry, human...\"\n\"I don't care. There's a battle coming. You'll be able to eat to your heart's content after this,\" I replied, stepping closer without fear.\n\"And why should I fight, when I've got horses to eat now?\" the ogre retorted, pointing to his improvised feast.\n\"Because I think I saw a couple of cows… and maybe a Pegasus. Maybe the taste will motivate you,\" I said, looking directly at him.\nThe ogre licked his lips ahead of time. \"Mhhh… it's been a while since I've had beef. Only horse… Well, let's go.\" He left the horse aside, though reluctantly.\nI began to ride, and the ogres followed me. I had to slow down a bit so as not to leave them behind. Despite their strength, they weren't fast. Still, one of them was devouring a piece of the horse they had just left behind, tearing at the meat with brutal force as he moved forward.\nWithin an hour, we were back at Monfort. I immediately began to regroup almost all of my available troops, leaving only a few personal units to guard the castle. I had no intention of returning from a battle only to find some Imperial noble had looted Monfort's coffers and left us stranded. As long as that gold was in place, all those parasites would continue to pander to me in order to get their share of the loot.\nSo, gathering eight thousand men, we began marching east to face the forces of Parravon. We tried to move as quickly as possible, not leaving the entire army far from Monfort in case of a rapid counterattack. Still, the garrison I had left behind — around two thousand well-armed men — should be able to resist without too much trouble.\nI had the ogres carry the cannons. It was much more efficient than using the damn wagons, which only slowed our progress. One of the reasons we took so long crossing the pass into Bretonia was precisely the weight of the artillery. And the idiot of the previous general never thought of using the ogres' brute strength to transport it.\nWith that problem solved, we moved at a good pace. I went ahead a bit of the army to scout the terrain and sense if there were any more sentries besides the ones we had already dealt with using the ogres. Fortunately, everything was quiet. During the three hours I was there and back, no one seemed to notice that their scouts had disappeared.\nThis allowed us to move through Parravon's territory without being detected.\nWe took a detour from the main road, climbing the hills to gain a tactical advantage. From there, we could force the Bretonnian cavalry to charge uphill, robbing them of the strength of their impact. Nothing like denying them their glorious charge in the open field and making them bleed while they fought uphill like any of their peasants.\nI organized our forces as best I could before we positioned ourselves on the hill. The first thing I did was use the ogres to set up the cannons. As soon as we had them in position, we loaded them and began firing immediately at the Bretonnian camp, which was still immersed in its routine.\nWhile the gunners, with the help of the ogres, continued firing relentlessly, the rest of our troops began to deploy at the top. I placed the pikemen at the front, forming a wall of spears, and behind them I set up several lines of musketeers and arquebusiers ready to fire over their heads.\nThe left flank I protected with a large portion of the Imperial noble forces. The right, however, was naturally covered by the steep slope of the hill. Any attempt by the Bretonnian knights to flank us would have to be done by making a long maneuver around the entire hill... by then, we'd already be waiting for them with loaded weapons.\nAs expected, the enemy camp turned into a complete mess. Men running in all directions, wild horses fleeing between tents, and cannonballs smashing everything in their path. Military tents were flying through the air along with whoever had been sleeping inside… if they had very bad luck.\nThe sound of cannonfire continued to reverberate throughout the valley as the Bretonnians tried to organize themselves amid the chaos. It didn't take long for them to improvise something that could barely be called a battle formation: a handful of knights advancing on foot at the front, followed by scattered lines of men-at-arms. Few still had their mounts.\nFrom above, our gunners, with the help of the ogres, repositioned the cannons without rest, realigning them toward the enemy mass that began its slow uphill march.\n\"Let's go, gentlemen! The Bretonnians are eager for suicide, and by Sigmar, we're going to grant them their wish!\" I shouted, raising my sword. My voice was followed by cheers from the soldiers who already knew what was coming.\nAs soon as the few mounted knights began to advance, I ordered all firing lines to step forward and open fire without mercy.\nThe muskets and arquebuses fired one after another. The smoke from the black powder began to obscure my view like a thick, oily fog. I had to move several times along the line to keep a clear view of what was happening downhill.\nThe Bretonnians continued advancing… but each volley tore through dozens of them. They fell like cut wheat, unable to even raise shields. It was a massacre, and it had barely begun.\nWe spent nearly half an hour without moving from the hill, firing nonstop, emptying our large reserves of black powder while the men of the Duchy of Parravon fell one by one. They died unable to do anything. Knights, squires, infantry... anyone who tried to resist was swept away. Finally, they began to retreat like rats, seeing that almost all their nobles were dead and that the men-at-arms were starting to surrender, begging for their lives after the massacre they had just witnessed.\nWhen it seemed safe, and the dense smoke of powder began to dissipate, we gave the order to descend. As we were descending, I saw several figures galloping out of one of the large tents in the camp. They were fleeing in a hurry, protected by escorts.\n\"Damn it… that has to be someone important if they needed knights to clear a path for them,\" I muttered, watching as they disappeared into the distance.\nThe Imperial noble troops didn't take long to rush in and loot. I saw them tearing pieces of armor off the corpses, cutting straps, and rummaging through the bodies. I didn't object. I even gave permission to my own men and the line regiments to do the same. There was no threat present, and victory was ours.\nI also kept my word to the ogres. When we reached the central large tent, we found ample food reserves, probably stored to feed the high-ranking nobles. The ogres lunged happily, sacrificing one of the cows with a single blow, splitting it in half with one of their huge weapons. In less than a minute, they had it spinning on an improvised fire, drooling from pure hunger.\n\"This was too easy… I almost regret burning the bridges that connected us to Bastonne. I could have launched another raid tomorrow,\" I murmured, watching the disaster from a nearby hill. Then I lifted my gaze westward.\n\"Divide and conquer… although it seems the enemy already got me one step ahead,\" I said through gritted teeth, grimacing as I saw, in the distance, the silhouette of Parravon's fortress rising above the hills.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

A sharp thorn, deeply embedded, cutting every time they take a step. While we wait for the Emperor's response — who is still in his palace surrounded by useless courtiers — we've moved to an aggressive stance. We no longer stay still. The Bretonnians are gathering their armies in scattered camps across their land, and we're making sure to harass them every time they show their faces.\nFour days ago, we clashed with the forces of Bastonne. We found a hidden pass that led to the plains and managed to cross the river undetected. It was a clean victory. Not as perfect as the previous one — where we had the terrain and surprise on our side — but enough to fill another field with Bretonnian corpses.\nOne of their Grail knights, a fool in shiny armor, died when one of our ogres smashed him with a cannon to the shoulder. He was knocked off his mount, and before he could recover, the ogre lit the fuse and blew him to pieces. The funniest thing was that the same cannon had been carried by the ogre all march, without even breaking a sweat. Apparently, the Duke of Bastonne wasn't present, busy with an orc campaign in the mountains. His army was leaderless, and we took care of the rest.\nThe ogres… blessed be them. Having them on our side is a damn blessing. I'd rather not imagine what it would be like to fight against them. I don't think their necks are as easy to snap as those of the Bretonnian soldiers. With them, you just need to tighten the steel around their necks, and they stop breathing. But with the ogres... I don't even know if they have necks. Just folds of fat and muscle. Maybe if I manage to turn their belly plates into spears, I could stab them there.\nAfter Bastonne, we seized enormous amounts of supplies. Weapons, banners, food, even a couple of barrels of wine that my men fought over. Today, we won another significant victory: we crushed the Duke of Gisoreux. Another Grail knight, gravely wounded by musket fire, managed to escape with his life. His men dragged him by the arms, pulling him out of the battlefield just as I was making my way through the infantry to reach him.\nI was so close... but I couldn't leave my men exposed. We had a horde of fanatics with spears and arrows on us, and I had to focus on disabling their weapons and stopping the projectiles. I couldn't afford to choke the knights who saved the duke. Another valuable hostage slipping through my fingers. I've lost count.\nBut the best news we've received in the last few weeks… is that King Phillippe V is dead. Finally. Old age caught up with him, although I would've liked to help him out. The new king is named Faramond, or something like that. A noble from the south, probably from Quenelles or Brionne. And with him comes the chaos of succession, the grudges between duchies, and all the crap that comes with it. I'd bet the attack will come from the south… or maybe from the north… or both. They no longer have the bridge with Bastonne — I took care of that — and they only have the pass we discovered after days of scouting the area. Two entry routes. Nothing more. And I control both.\nSo far, we've crushed the forces of three dukes with fewer than a thousand of our own casualties. Our team is intact, our stores full, and Monfort's treasure could withstand a siege for months. Even with food being distributed among the population, we'd endure without a problem. And if I decided to let them starve and only feed my men... we could last for years.\nWhen we marched east towards Gisoreux, I took the opportunity to occupy all the smaller fortifications that still answered to the old Duke of Monfort. Castles with fewer than a hundred men, but which complicated our territorial control. We emptied them one by one, collecting everything useful. We found huge amounts of gold ore extracted from the local mines. For obvious reasons, it wasn't sent to Monfort. So it wouldn't fall into our hands. What irony. Now all that gold will be melted in our workshops, turned into ingots, and stored in our vaults. And of course, it's a generous payment to us... for our occupation.\nBut for now, we had to keep waiting.\n\"Then tell me, Folcard… I've always been curious to know this.\" I took a piece of meat into my mouth, chewing slowly. \"How does it feel knowing that your entire duchy is under imperial control… and that your gold mines and merchants are generously funding our occupation?\"\nThe Duke of Monfort lifted his gaze as best as he could. One eye was shut from the swelling, the other half open. He had trouble breathing. He could hardly speak, with all his teeth rearranged by punches after our duel. But he still replied:\n\"The Lady will not remain idle while you, cowards, profane one of Bretonnia's ancestral duchies… This will not go unpunished.\"\n\"Oh, really?\" I placed my knife on the plate and pointed to it with the tip of my fork, not losing my smile. \"And when will that happen? The army of Monfort is already part of the mud. Your castles are empty, your knights are dead, and you… here sitting, like a beaten dog.\"\nI cut another piece and dropped it onto the bread. \"Your king is dead. And the new one, if he has the guts to sit on the throne, must be too busy with seals and crowns to come save you. That is, if his legs don't shake when he sees what we've done to you.\"\nI took the bite into my mouth while watching him in silence.\n\"But Folcard… if it comforts you, your people are still good for something. The gold from your mines is filling our warehouses, and your peasants work with much more enthusiasm now that they don't have to share their bread with your knights.\"\n\"I swear... when the conditions change... and it's me who has you in this same position… you will pay for this.\" The Duke of Monfort spat the words with rage as he tried to catch his breath. \"I swear by the Lady.\"\n\"Oh? Really?\" I slowly turned my head toward a corner of the room where his wife and children were sitting, under guard. \"Because that kind of reckless attitude tends to bring... unpleasant consequences. Very bad things. Very bad things, Folcard.\"\nHis breath became more ragged. His eyes fixed on me... then on them. He lowered his gaze, and with a still trembling hand, he tried to close his fingers around the knife on the table. A dry grunt broke the air.\n\"Don't you dare,\" said my bodyguard, a veteran with a scar running across his face. \"I'll break your face again,.\"\nThe Duke froze. The tension in his jaw was evident.\n\"Besides...\" I leaned toward him, speaking in a low voice, almost as if sharing a secret. \"I think you've wanted to kill me for quite some time now. Two years, perhaps?\"\nFolcard furrowed his brow, confused. \"I don't even know you. You're just an upstart imperial noble who got lucky,\" he replied, still trying to maintain some dignity.\n\"Luck?\" I laughed, shaking my head. \"Two years ago, I killed a Grail Knight with a dwarf arquebus.\"\nThat was enough for his one good eye to open wide. The color drained from his face.\n\"Ah... so you do remember, don't you, Duke?\" I said with a smile.\n\"But… but… you were just a kid,\" said the Duke, surprised.\n\"Ah, family genetics,\" I replied with a big grin. \"When you're born with good blood, amazing things can happen in no time.\"\nI straightened up, left the cutlery on the plate, and moved a little closer, enjoying every second. \"You don't have to be naive, Folcard. You challenged me to a duel and lost… against someone who hasn't even been named a knight yet.\"\nI let out a loud, mocking laugh as I watched him grit his teeth in impotent fury.\n\"One of the representatives of the sacred Bretonnian cavalry, beaten and humiliated by a young man without a knight's title. Pathetic.\" I said, walking around him.\nThe Duke swallowed hard. His pride was shattered.\n\"I dare say your beloved wife saved you from the truth. Maybe she thought it was better not to destroy your dignity completely.\"\nI sat back down, crossing my legs calmly. \"But for a parasite like you… there isn't much time left. And it's better that you die knowing all your mistakes... or live with them. Humiliation is a much more lasting punishment than death, after all. Don't you think?\" I said, showing him the knife.\nI laughed again. This time quietly, with the smile still on my face.\nThe doors of the tower opened slowly, letting in one of the riders I had sent to Altdorf days ago.\n\"Speaking of fate… seems like the answer to what will happen to you is here,\" I said, turning to receive the letter.\n\"My lord Baron, I apologize for the delay, but the imperial court moved slower than I anticipated for something so important. The Grand Theogonist has reviewed the evidence provided by the collaborator and has decided to advise the Emperor to send an army to control Monfort and reinforce the watch over the presence of Chaos and vampirism in Bretonnia. As we speak, another imperial general is assembling an army, calling all nearby nobles to provide the respective men to form the state regiments. Reinforcements should arrive soon,\" said the messenger.\nI turned toward the Duke. \"Well, looks like your luck has run out. You're not going to live much longer.\"\nWith that big news, I stood up from my chair and began preparing everything for the change of command. I doubted I could continue controlling the army with the arrival of a force composed of powerful nobles. Everything had gone well, the former general's bet had worked wonders… except for the tiny detail that he died.\nNow, a multitude of powerful nobles from all regions of the Empire would come to contest the control of Monfort. Clearly, I am out of that game. I still lack the influence and power to fight the big players of the Empire.\nBut I'm taking with me more than half a million crowns in gold, and who knows how many more I can take before the reinforcements arrive.\nI immediately ordered the Duke's treasury to be emptied, and I also had all his servants called. Although I've earned a reputation for being generous among them, I doubt they'll voluntarily want to follow me to imperial lands. But bringing a large group of Bretons to populate one of my mining villages could be very useful, considering the experience many have in gold extraction for the Duke.\nIn the following days, while everyone prepared, I organized the abundant supplies I had for the servants' journey to my lands. Above all, I made sure to have enough reserves for when they arrived, starting to completely plunder Monfort, removing everything of value… even the peasants.\nI left behind ghost towns, moving large amounts of peasants to a temporary camp, from where I would later take them to my territories.\nI only left the sacred artifacts for the Cult of the Lady. If anyone wanted to steal them, it would no longer be my problem.\nAnd so, I simply waited for the arrival of the imperial army.\nAlthough when it arrived, it brought with it even worse news: I was to present myself before the Emperor's court immediately… and I began to break out in a cold sweat at the thought of going to a place where there was a great chance they would discover who I really was.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

In Reinsfeld, still young as an Imperial city, the guards patrolled the streets shouting orders, while the city militia began to mobilize. Alarmed news arrived from the roads: a force of almost three thousand men was advancing toward the city without stopping, ignoring the outposts, marching with firm steps and banners deployed. They carried the colors of a House with which the von Reinsfelds had shared a blood conflict for five generations.\nThe captains gathered all those who could wield a weapon. Levies were improvised in the squares, spears, pikes, some crossbows were distributed, and all the muskets from the armorers were handed out. The blacksmiths left their workshops with hammers in hand, the butchers with long knives, and even some apprentices took their place in the line. The doors of the temples remained open, and the priests of Sigmar gave blessings as fast as they could while the smoke from the forges stained the sky.\nAmidst that chaotic mobilization, no one paid attention to a figure cloaked in rags descending from the castle in a transport cart. It moved slowly down the cobbled street, heading toward the eastern exit of the city.\nome saw it pass, but none stopped to ask. Between preparations for battle and the urgency of defending the city, an elderly, hunched figure was not cause for alarm.\nThe enemy column continued its march along the main road. They didn't stop to loot nor diverted their march toward the watchposts. They followed a single direction, neither quickening nor slowing their pace, with the ranks ordered and weapons slung over their shoulders. They seemed ready to take the city without a word, confident that nothing in their path would stop them.\nIt was near noon when one of their detachments found the old man. The cart was partially blocking the road, and the old man stood next to the mule, watching silently. A rider moved forward arrogantly, raising his sword.\n\"These roads belong to my father, the legitimate Baron of Reinsfeld, Theodor von Kesselheim. I'd recommend you start paying tribute, merchant, before we take back what belongs to us,\" said the young man, pointing at the man wrapped in rags with the tip of his blade.\nThe old man looked at him steadily. His eyes reflected the light like beaten gold.\n\"Oh, of course… actually, I was just about to do that. My master sends his regards,\" he replied with a raspy voice. With a slow gesture, he removed the tarp from the cart.\nUnderneath were mounds of blue pigment. Reikland blue. The color that adorned banners and shields in the city. The color that reminded everyone who ruled now.\nThe old man stripped off his rags. Under them, he wore a tunic of burnished gold, adorned with metallic filaments that pulsed with energy. A golden mask covered his face, and in his hand appeared a lead staff reinforced with gold and a blue gem. The air around him began to vibrate, as if the world itself was preparing to break.\n\"Doomus Ardentus,\" he whispered. The winds of Chamon responded instantly.\nA storm of silver shards descended upon the riders as if the very skies had cracked. The thin, shining stakes pierced flesh, broke ribs, tore arms, and pierced armor as if it were wet paper. Some bodies were thrown to the ground by the violence of the impact, while others remained impaled on their mounts, still alive, screaming in spasms as blood poured in torrents onto the cobbled road.\nWhile the survivors tried to understand what had happened, still trembling from the initial impact, the old man raised his staff again. His voice, deep and serene, rose above the echoes of screams:\n\"Sagittae Argenteae Arhae.\"\nHundreds of silver arrows began to materialize behind his back, spinning in shining spirals before launching like a killing cloud at the soldiers trying to regroup. Each projectile found a mark. Dozens fell instantly, pierced in the chest, throat, or face. The men screamed, tried to run, but the projectiles kept falling in unstoppable waves.\nThe winds of Chamon swirled powerfully around the old man, as if the world itself had chosen to channel its fury through him. The armor of the dead began to react to one of his spells. It deformed, wrinkled, melted, until all — breastplates, shields, swords, and helms — were drawn toward a single point by an invisible force. A growing sphere of molten steel levitated in the air, formed from every metal fragment gathered from the battlefield. It glowed with a white, blinding light from the accumulated heat. Then it exploded.\nThe explosion bathed everything still alive within a wide radius in molten steel. The soldiers screamed without a voice, covered in bubbling metal that devoured their flesh, melting muscles, tearing skin, and drilling into bones. Some fell to their knees before collapsing, while others simply disintegrated in convulsions. The stench of burned flesh filled the air, thicker than the dust.\nWhile the bodies burned and silver fragments kept falling without pause, another barrage of conjured arrows pierced those trying to flee. The old man then raised a golden whistle he had conjured. He blew it once.\nFrom the shadows of the path emerged the Gehenna's Golden Hounds. Creatures of living metal, with bodies of burnished gold and eyes like burning coals, descended upon the remnants of the detachment. Each bite tore off limbs. Each stride left a trail of heat upon the earth. The few who were still moving were devoured in screams that didn't seem human.\nThe noble's son, paralyzed since the first spell, was covered by a solid layer of gold. His face still carried an expression of horror. Around him, his men lay in pieces, either scorched or impaled. The mage raised his staff once more, and all the molten steel he had spread across the field rose again. The heat was so intense that the earth began to crack beneath his feet.\nThe spell ended. The gold covering the young man dissolved slowly, leaving his body naked and trembling. Then the molten steel sphere fell over him. The mass covered him entirely, silencing his scream instantly, enveloping him in a burning prison that hardened upon contact with the winds of Chamon. After a few seconds, where once there had been a noble, there was now only a polished black sculpture, capturing the moment when he tried to plead for his life.\nThe field fell silent. Only the crackling of cooling metal broke the calm.\nThe old man breathed heavily. Sweat ran down his forehead, and his hands trembled, though not from fear. \"Never... had I felt so much concentrated power...\" he murmured before covering his face once again with the rags.\nWithout saying a word, he climbed into the cart, took the reins, and made his way into the nearest forest. He knew he could not stay. There were too many eyes in the Empire.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on\n-------------------------------",

With what they brought, they could easily resist anything Bretonia could throw at them. The problem would be what to do afterward, as I noticed the presence of many nobles, the Margrave of Helmgart, Graf Wallenstein, Graf Falkenhyn, Graf Jungfreud, and some nobles from Middenland, Wissenland, and Talabecland, many of whose heraldry I didn't even recognize. With so many powerful nobles at the forefront, I had no doubt they would begin to fight over control of Monfort's gold mines or lead the campaign against another duke, especially now that they were weakened.\nSo everything would depend on the new general, if he had enough influence and the loyalty of the troops, he could control the nobles and prevent the campaign from spiraling out of control. After all, I left him an excellent base from which to launch future offensives.Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nOf course… the treasury of Monfort is empty, save for the spiders, and the granaries are also empty, although he might find some rats if he's lucky. Also, the gold mines… well, they still have mineral, but no workers. I made sure to empty all the villages in Monfort. I forced the evacuation of every village and hamlet. Though my plan to take the entire population would have been much more fruitful if it had been in Bastonne or Parravon, Monfort, being mountainous, only had three decent-sized villages and one main city, Monfort. The rest were small villages with little population.\nStill, I'm taking over sixty thousand Bretons to Reinsfeld. I'll settle them in my mining village to take advantage of their experience in mining for the duke.\nI'll have to use a large portion of the gold I earned from the campaign to fund a decent mining town, but in about five to ten years, it could become a huge source of minerals… and soldiers. Although, of course, a strong presence of the Cult of Sigmar and mandatory Reikspiel classes will be essential. I'm not going to teach two languages to all my officers due to a language barrier that could be resolved in one generation… or two at worst.\nThe general informed me immediately that the Emperor would pay me fifty thousand crowns in the capital for all the prisoners and the bodies of important Bretonnian nobles and knights under my control. A fair compensation for keeping them alive or in good condition.\nUpon reaching Helmgart, we were followed by my returning army and also by the Bretonnian peasants, who followed us, both forced and voluntary, looking for a life not as oppressive as the one they led under the nobility of their land.\nIn Helmgart, I took advantage of the local temple of the Cult of Sigmar to have a priest review certain Bretonnian magical items we had captured that were not linked to the Cult of the Lady. I knew perfectly well that they were not corrupted — the rotten smell is unmistakable — but I needed official backing from the Cult so I could use them without causing problems in the capital.\nWe passed quickly before the guards, who watched us as our procession carried as much gold as we could fit onto the captured Bretonnian horses. Even the peasants carried sacks full of gold. I saw the greed in their faces, but since it was a returning army, they couldn't excuse themselves by pretending it was looting disguised as an inspection.\nWe left Helmgart without incident, and once on the other side, I began the necessary procedures to release the army and distribute the loot as stipulated by Imperial law.\nThe Emperor was entitled to 25% of the loot, although literally, all he did was authorize the military mission. I was entitled to 50% as the replacement general. The nobles would get 10%, and the bulk of the troops, 15%.\nOn average, each soldier received about 10 crowns in their pockets. The mercenaries, however, did not get any of the campaign loot, as whatever they looted on their own belonged to them. And since they didn't have to share it, many ended up with fuller pockets than the regular troops.\nThe total loot we captured amounted to around one hundred thousand crowns, but it had to be sold first, and we'd probably only get half of it since much of the equipment was damaged or only useful as material for other forges. Because of this, I gave up my share and ordered it to be handed directly to the troops. I had no interest in dealing with local merchants selling old equipment and hoping to turn it into gold.\nStill, my share amounted to about 350,000 crowns, plus the ransom reward. Upon reaching Reinsfeld, I would have to fulfill my promise to pay the salary and the corresponding share of the loot to the families of the 176 soldiers I lost during the campaign. A smaller number, considering the total casualties, since out of the 18,000 we set out with, around thirteen thousand returned. Although I risked more with the noble troops and kept my own men sheltered, I managed to keep most of my forces alive… but 176 will never return.\nTheir bodies, which received the basic rituals of Morr, should be buried in their garden as soon as possible. I can't allow those who died more than a month ago to keep rotting without a proper burial.\nIt was here where we parted ways. Before dissolving the army, I offered the state soldiers, once dissolved, the option to move to my lands, with permission to call their families and settle. I promised them houses and a salary. Many were ecstatic with the proposal and decided to follow me back to Reinsfeld. They preferred that over going back to serve as guards for some minor noble without glory or stability. Apparently, I had earned a good reputation among them.\nSo something unusual happened in times of war, more soldiers returned with me than those who left. Though, of course, we were also followed by the entire mass of Bretonnian peasants I had evacuated from Monfort.\nOnly fifty men stayed with me, my five personal guards and the rest, men-at-arms who would escort me to Altdorf. This event had me extremely nervous. I put on all my best clothes, dyed with Reikland blue pigment — the one that attracts Chamon — and kept my runic armor on. It served to divert attention and perhaps confuse anyone who tried to scrutinize me with magic.\nI also put on all the Bretonian rings I could, sliding them over my gauntlets. They were armor rings. When I wore them, I could feel myself stronger, more vigorous. They must have been enchanted with the Lore of Life.\nSo, with all the magical items I could carry, with every protection and distraction possible, I rode toward Altdorf, followed by the cart carrying the Emperor's gold. And for the first time, I prayed to Sigmar. I asked for mercy, even if I had abused his name to gain fame.\nWe rode all day toward Altdorf, while my stomach tightened with each step the horse took. I could feel the weight of what awaited me, and the fast pace we maintained didn't help calm my nerves.\nWe rested one night in Bogenhafen, in the house of a noble, and I waited for dawn to continue. We rode until noon the next day, when we finally arrived in Altdorf. This is where the ultimate test would begin, to see if I had full control over my abilities... and if all the magical items I had acquired would serve to protect me.\nWe entered through the south gate, the most direct route to the Imperial Palace. As I rode down the cobbled streets, I felt everyone watching me. Especially the priests of Sigmar who were coming out of the cathedral. I tried to breathe steadily while moving. Although it hadn't happened in months, I was afraid of losing control of my power at such a critical moment.\nI took a deep breath and advanced toward the entrance to the palace, where two members of the Reiksguard guarded with shining armor and swords that seemed more ornamental than functional.\nI handed over the letter the general had given me, with the express order to present myself before the Emperor.\nOne of them immediately sent a messenger inside, and they allowed me to enter.\nI crossed the gardens, where dozens of servants were maintaining the perfectly green grass, the clean fountains, and the cleared paths. They led me to the main structure, where they left me waiting for a few minutes in a large room that made me feel like an ant. The walls were towering, with elevated hallways and stained glass windows that let the light in.\nMy own guards were tense. I tried to maintain my composure.\nI heard footsteps to my right. I turned, and suddenly felt someone touch my clothes.\nMy heart stopped when I saw a wizard in white robes and a pointed hat of the same color. He was a collegiate wizard\n\"I knew it,\" he said, looking at me intently.\nI looked at him like a rabbit caught in a lantern's light, expecting the gunshot.\n\"These clothes are dyed with that alchemical pigment. I found it odd, the emanation of Chamon coming from you... I can understand Hysh and Ghyran from the rings, but Chamon...\" murmured the wizard.\n\"Yes,\" I responded with difficulty. \"They're from the pigment you mentioned, sir wizard.\" I composed myself as best as I could.\n\"Nervous, huh? Audience with the Emperor, I understand,\" he said with a smile. \"I won't waste your time. My question is,do you know who produces this pigment? The Colleges are desperate to contact the supplier. But the merchant who was selling it disappeared overnight. We lost track of him. And considering the amount you must have used for these clothes, I assume you have the contact.\"\n\"Eh... well... I'm the manufacturer,\" I confessed, trying to justify the emanation of Chamon in his eyes.\n\"Really? How fortunate to find the alchemist who creates such a useful component for enchantments,\" he responded with a huge smile.\n\"I'm not an alchemist... It's a gift from Sigmar. Though I admit, alchemy has interested me a bit since I started working with gunpowder,\" I responded nervously.\n\"How is it a gift from Sigmar?\" asked the wizard, raising an eyebrow.\n\"The two-tailed comet showed it to me in a dream... where to find the mineral, how to process it...\" I responded, now more calm.\n\"Interesting... That doesn't change the fact that my order wants to make an immediate purchase of everything you have available. We could perform dozens of new enchantments if we had access to that component,\" he said, already pulling out a small pouch of coins.\n\"He won't sell you any of that, wizard,\" said a disdainful voice approaching.\nI turned my head. I nearly had a heart attack seeing the Archlector of Sigmar, advancing with his heavy armor covered in purity seals and cult amulets.\nThe Archlector looked at me for a few seconds, observed my hand full of rings, and raised an eyebrow.\n\"That is a gift from our lord Sigmar to the House Reinsfeld, honorable defender of the borders of Reikland. That gift must not be corrupted by... your hands,\" he said coldly, looking at the wizard.\n\"you dont understand how much our research could benefit,\" replied the wizard, crossing his arms.\n\"Better that it's not used. I won't allow a gift from blessed Sigmar to fall into profane hands. Especially now that one of yours caused the disaster near Reinsfeld,\" said the Archlector, hardening his tone.\n\"What happened in my city?\" I asked, eyes wide open.\n\"Ah… it must be a surprise for you, baron,\" said the Archlector, crossing his arms. \"Our witch hunters confirmed a dangerous event near your lands. According to the report, there was a wizard among a group of troops from the House Kesselheim who lost control. He attracted demons to the region. When our Sigmar's servants arrived, they found two Chaos factions fighting each other, and a high concentration of profane energy.\"\n\"That's what the uncultured eyes say,\" the wizard responded, visibly upset. \"We're still waiting for the official report from our College representatives before issuing judgment.\"\n\"Bah... They're just trying to cover for their own. They probably made up some excuse to avoid responsibility. But it's clear that it was one of yours, incapable of controlling his magic, who caused this disaster. So leave. The gift of Sigmar is not for sale to you, tools of the profane,\" spat the Archlector.\nThe wizard shook his head and left in silence.\n\"Is everything alright in my city?\" I asked the Archlector.\n\"Yes, Baron. Everything is under control. The reinforced presence of priests and witch hunters allowed the situation to be resolved quickly. Fortunately, the rot did not spread beyond the affected area, and purification chants were sung when all the demons were expelled. We are currently investigating the Kesselheim for having an unlicensed wizard... as it would be impossible for a wizard to hide with all the witch hunters present in your city. Everything indicates that it was an uncontrolled wizard who attracted his own corrupt magic, which caught the attention of the servants of Chaos. Since the demons fought among themselves, our brave servants of Sigmar were able to defeat them easily,\" said the Archlector.\n'It was Hieronymus, that's clear… but damn… what the hell happened?' I thought to myself.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

However, there is something I have wanted to discuss with you for some time,\" said the Archlector, staring at me intently.\n\"If you believe it can be discussed here, I have all the time in the world to listen, honorable servant of our Lord Sigmar,\" I responded with a smile.\n\"It is about the situation with the witch hunters in your city. The current arrangement was accepted only because the local lector interceded on your behalf, and considering the reward for your help in clearing the forests infested with mutants and beastmen, especially for the benefit of the Cult, we cannot force a noble to establish permanent witch hunter quarters without clear evidence of heresy. But this situation requires firm and determined action. One never knows what might occur in a city like yours. Therefore, it is necessary to return all the powers to the witch hunters so they can do their duty. This time we have sent veterans of the Cult, not just fresh graduates. To guarantee the security of Reinsfeld, we need your approval,\" said the Archlector in a solemn tone.\n\"I understand the need, but Archlector... also understand that some of yours have a rather fanatical view of our Lord Sigmar. For some, even the slightest transgression must be paid with purifying fire,\" I responded, scratching my head.\n\"It is necessary, Baron. The situation warrants it. The Grand Theogonist could send the petition directly to the Emperor to authorize the entry of the witch hunters with all their powers, without your approval. But, in consideration of your proximity to the Cult, we come to request your consent... temporarily,\" the Archlector explained.\n\"And how temporary is this 'temporary'?\" I asked, tilting my head.\n\"Two months should suffice to eliminate any trace of corruption,\" he replied firmly.\n\"May I at least request that burnings without evidence be avoided and that I be given reports of what they do? I do not want executions to start based on mere suspicion. There is already enough unrest in my city due to the restrictions imposed. I have worked hard to ensure that all the Empire's children, regardless of their origin, feel part of a single people. If neighbors begin accusing one another, it could trigger chaos,\" I said, lowering my head slightly.\nThe Archlector paused for a few seconds, contemplating. \"Given the circumstances... what you suggest is a real possibility. I will inform the Cult of this conversation. The witch hunters will have to provide evidence before executing any sentence, and they will not be allowed to burn anyone without it. The scenario you mentioned could easily happen, and we must avoid it,\" he said, nodding his head.\n\"Thank you very much, Archlector... if everything goes as it should, this will be a great step toward uniting all imperial cultures as one in defense of the Empire,\" I responded gratefully.\n\"Without a doubt, someone as devoted as you, and clearly favored by our Lord, cannot be wrong. Especially when it was one of his dreams of the Twin-Tailed Comet that guided you,\" said the Archlector, staring at me once again. \"I'm curious... how was the Bretonnian campaign? I understand that almost no one has details about what goes on in those pagan lands,\" he asked with genuine interest.\n\"Ah... of course. As you know, we managed to defeat the armies of the Duke of Montfort just outside his fortress. And when they temporarily ceded leadership to me, I was able to negotiate the surrender of the garrison. Though, it seems it was some sort of trap, as part of their forces faced us after we took control. Once we had Montfort... with Sigmar's guidance in my dreams, I clearly saw where the Bretonnian armies preparing the counterattack were located. And following his advice, I struck first, defeating three more ducal armies before I was replaced,\" I responded calmly.\n\"Three ducal armies? That information hadn't reached us yet... Did many of those false Grail idols fall?\" the Archlector asked, with enthusiasm he didn't try to hide.\n\"Six, to be exact. One escaped. It was a Bretonnian duke who managed to flee before we killed him... but he was pulled off the field by his own men. He was gravely wounded,\" I replied with a more serene tone, noticing that the Sigmarite servant was really interested in what had happened in Bretonnia.Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n\"It would have been grand to land such a blow... having one of the Bretonnian dukes under our control,\" said the Archlector.\n\"We have the Duke of Montfort as a prisoner. I captured him in a duel, though I don't know what will be done with him and his family. If the Empire wishes to retain the fortress, it's likely that he will no longer be in this world,\" I replied.\n\"A successful campaign, by what I hear. Do you think the pagans of Bretonnia will open their eyes to our Lord Sigmar, god of humanity, instead of that false idol, the Lady?\" the Archlector asked.\n\"I hope so. The Bretonnian peasant lives like trash in their society... that's why they must be so susceptible to vampirism or Chaos, as the information from our collaborator stated. In fact, I brought with me about fifty thousand Bretonnian peasants that I plan to put to work and test exactly what it says: that if our priests can open their eyes to that false deity, we could create a new city. I hope to have the Emperor's support for that enterprise,\" I said with a smile.\n\"A noble wager that the Cult would be happy to finance. In fact, when I speak with the Grand Theogonist, after his meetings with other members of the clergy, I will request funds to support that project. A good deed need not go ignored,\" said the Archlector.\n\"I don't know what to say... thank you very much,\" I replied, clearly surprised by how easily I was securing financial backing from the Cult.\n\"Oh, I almost forgot... the Grand Theogonist asked me to ask you if you could help with a small matter. It is known that the von Reinsfeld family has the gift of detecting beastmen. In an attempt to reduce their presence in the Drakwald forests, and in coordination with the Ar-Ulric, it is planned to send clerical forces to carry out a cleansing near Carroburg. If you were the one sent, considering your fearsome reputation as a hunter, it would help ease tensions with the followers of Ulric. Your presence and that of your veterans would be of great help in cleaning the area,\" the Archlector explained.\n\"Ah... really? I was planning to do the same until they called me to go to Bretonnia,\" I said, scratching my head with a finger.\n\"It must be the will of our Lord Sigmar then... the desires of the Cult always present themselves in your actions, Baron,\" said the Archlector just as the palace doors opened.\n\"Archlector, the Emperor requests that you enter immediately. Baron von Reinsfeld, you will have to wait a little longer,\" said a member of the Reiksguard.\n\"Of course... we will speak of this later, Baron,\" said the Archlector, walking into the room.\nThe doors closed, and I was left alone again, relaxing after the harrowing experience of being interrogated by both a wizard and a high-ranking member of the Cult of Sigmar.\n\"What a pleasant guy the Archlector is, don't you think?\" I said, looking at my guards, who nodded immediately, probably thinking the same as I did: how rare it is to find a member of the clergy so easy to talk to.\nSo I waited a few more minutes until the doors finally opened.\n\"Baron, enter. Your audience begins,\" said the member of the Reiksguard.\nI took a deep breath and entered the Volkshalle.\nImmediately, I saw the large number of Reiksguard members surrounding the area. The room was circular, like a parliament, surrounding the Emperor's throne, with each sector representing some of the electoral seats. Many were empty, but those from Middenland, Nordland, and Ostermark were filled with nobles in their respective places, surrounding the Emperor to his left and right. Behind the throne were multiple members of the Sigmarite clergy. In chairs at the center of the room, there were two Elector Counts sitting: one with the white wolf heraldry of Ulric and the other with a ship, which I assumed were the Elector Counts of Middenland and Norland. And in the center of it all, on his elevated throne, was Emperor Luitpold, with Ghal Maraz resting on a pedestal at his side. Although I understood that hammer was fake... or could I be mistaken?\nI continued walking towards the center of the room until one of the Reiksguard guards signaled me to stop. I stopped and knelt, lowering my head.\n\"Who do I have before me now?\" I heard an imposing voice ask in front of me.\n\"The Baron of Reinsfeld, and lord of the city of Reinsfeld,\" someone replied.\n\"Ah, yes, I remember now... the one with whom I signed the treaty for the Grey Mountains, whose son killed a Grail Knight,\" said the voice of the Emperor. I heard footsteps approaching the throne, and someone took place next to him.\n\"Indeed... so the expedition was his son... I see... Albrecht von Reinsfeld, raise your head,\" said the Emperor.\nI obeyed, and as I looked up, I saw someone whispering to the Emperor. It was a tall man, with dark hair, well-defined features, and a carefully groomed beard. He was staring at me intently.\n\"Let me understand... are you twelve summers old?\" asked the Emperor, raising an eyebrow. The two Counts also raised their eyebrows, visibly surprised.\n\"Yes, Your Imperial Majesty,\" I responded courteously.\n\"Can you explain how you managed to take control of the Imperial army? I always thought that when they referred to the Baron of Reinsfeld, they were talking about your father,\" said the Emperor, placing a hand under his chin.\n\"The general avoided bringing many powerful nobles to avoid having to deal with disputes over command. So, as the noble who brought the most troops, I financed new contracts for the mercenaries and gained the support of the regiment captains. The other nobles accepted. Especially when I defeated Duke Montfort in a duel, no one wanted to face me,\" I replied firmly.\nThe Counts looked at each other, then at the Emperor, who seemed thoughtful.\n\"Well... this changes nothing. Albrecht, for your actions in times of need and your successful capture of Montfort, opening the gates for the Imperial advance in Bretonnia to eradicate the corruption of those lands, I, Luitpold, Emperor of the Holy Empire of Man, Prince of Altdorf, and Elector Count of Reikland, grant you the feudal estate of Merxheim and all the lands surrounding it. Additionally, I grant you the title of Graf and an annual income of three thousand crowns to finance the forces of your House. Considering that you already possess a runic sword, I will ask our friends from the mountains to forge you a plate armor with major runes... make sure it's done and you will be exempt from paying taxes for the next decade so that you can fill your coffers after such military effort and construction,\" said the Emperor, looking at the man who had been whispering to him.\n\"I will inform our zoo that, in case any griffon hatches, it will be prepared immediately for you, young Albrecht,\" added the Emperor while watching me.\n\"Thank you, my Emperor...\" I said, lowering my head again, wishing that it would all end soon, as so many eyes — and so many priests — staring at me were making me extremely nervous.\n\"Ah, and one more thing,\" said the Emperor, standing up and drawing a sword that emitted a glow.\n\"We cannot forget that a victorious general of the Empire should be part of the knightly circles,\" said the Emperor as he approached. He struck my right shoulder with the sword. \"Receive this blow, which marks your entry into the Order of Knights. As proof of your honor, bravery, and loyalty to the Empire, I knight you.\" Then he struck my left shoulder. \"I knight you to defend justice, protect the innocent, and follow the paths of virtue that our Lord Sigmar has shown us.\"\n\"Rise, knight,\" said the Emperor, and I obeyed.\n\"Let all know that the Empire has a new sword protecting it,\" exclaimed the Emperor, spinning around and observing all the present before returning to his throne.\n\"Graf Albrecht you are formally invited to a banquet that will be held this evening in your honor... you may leave,\" concluded the Emperor.\nWithout saying a word, I began to leave the Volkshalle. Although when the doors closed, I started jumping with joy in front of my guards' gaze, celebrating that I wouldn't have to pay taxes for 10 years.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

      "content": "I'd like to ask a good question, recommendations for wives, because my friend and researcher of this work and I are in a dilemma. I am of the opinion that MC married for political power and probably has a mistress, while my friend says that MC is more likely to have married for love and has lovers because of his impulsiveness, although I always remind him of the prince of excess.\nThat's why I'm asking for your opinion on this, since we're at least stuck on which direction to take.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------\nSommerzeit-4,2489 IC\nI was satisfied with the outcome of the meeting, especially because nothing suspicious had been discovered. Apparently, they only noticed the magic emanating from my clothes and rings, maybe confusing it with the idea that it came from the enchantments on the objects themselves, leaving them with doubts about what was truly happening. To me, that was perfect.\nTen years without paying taxes... by Sigmar, that was quite convenient. Every year I had to give twenty-five percent of all my income to the Elector Count of Reikland, which represented a massive amount of gold, especially now that I was involved in so many ventures on a large scale. I don't know if someone gave the Emperor a bad report, or if the gold I provided seemed insignificant to him, but that sum is not small: it could fund thousands of soldiers every year. So ten years of tax exemption seemed more like a decision based on incomplete information than a calculated gesture. Still, I wasn't going to complain.\nAs much as I wanted to leave Altdorf as soon as possible and never return, I had to attend the banquet that was being organized in my honor. It would be an insult for the Emperor to host a celebration in my name, and for me not to show up. I was obliged to stay, even if that meant spending hours surrounded by nobles who, without a doubt, would line up to approach me, each with their own agenda. Some would come to beg for gold loans, others would seek political or military support, and some would try to drag me into a land or lineage dispute less important than the dirt on my boots.\nSo, I simply waited in one of the houses I had bought when I came for the trials, a building I had left forgotten, covered in dust and without decorations. I sat in a wooden chair bought at the local market, conversing with my men about their opinions of the campaign, letting them relax a bit while they drank wine and beer. I didn't drink, and neither did my bodyguards. Not only to maintain sobriety for health reasons but because I never owe a favor, and drink could be a way for them to gain favors from me. The general's mistake was one I would not repeat, even though it had gone well, filling my coffers with the loot and tax reductions. But the risk of dying was extremely high. Facing Grial maidens, although dangerous if you are caught off guard, was nothing compared to facing a Grail Knight.\nAll that was left was to wait. When the time finally came, I put on all my armor. If there were members of Sigmar's Cult, I preferred them to keep believing that the magic emanated from my rings and not from me. For that, I needed the armor: it hid my body, distorted the origin of the energy, and also intimidated. A noble who looked like a well-armed soldier is rarely approached for favors.\nOnce again, I arrived at the Imperial Palace. This time, the Reiksguard did not stop me. One of the guards simply opened the door and we were allowed directly into the banquet halls.\n\"By Sigmar... how many banquet halls do they have?\" I murmured, seeing how the doors stretched down the entire length of the hallway.\n\"I think it's that one, my lord baron... sorry, Graf,\" said one of my bodyguards, pointing to an entrance flanked by guards, immediately correcting himself with my new title.\n\"Ha... let's go. I don't want to be late to my own banquet in my honor. And be careful with what they drink; no one knows what they might put in your cup in these places.\"\nWhen I entered the hall, I was bombarded with an unbearable mix of excessive perfumes and spicy foods. The air was so dense that I could feel my eyes filling with tears. My guards weren't having it any better: one of them already had a wrinkled face, and another was discreetly covering his nose with a gloved hand. It was a direct attack on the senses, as if they were trying to poison us with smells instead of knives.\n\"The guest of honor has arrived: Albrecht von Reinsfeld, Graf of Reinsfeld, Merxheim, and lord of the city of Reinsfeld,\" shouted one of the members of the Reiksguard standing at the entrance, so loudly that the music stopped for a few seconds to allow him to recite the full title without interruptions.\nI felt how all the eyes in the grand banquet hall were fixed on me. I walked with firm steps, scanning the room for a slightly more isolated place to hide from the attention, but that wasn't going to happen. My worst fears materialized in a matter of seconds.\nA wave of perfume-soaked nobles surrounded me almost immediately. They began to bombard me with compliments, proposals, and questions while my bodyguards tensed around me, reacting to any strange movement, some already on the verge of lunging at certain guests who, by the way they approached, seemed too suspicious.\n\"Oh, young Graf, I didn't know you were as charming as you are brave...\" tried one noblewoman before being rudely interrupted by another.\n\"My daughter would be eager to dance with you if...\" said another woman, interrupted by an old noble.\n\"I don't think the Graf is interested in dancing. Surely, he wants to tell us his stories...\" said another noble, though he was completely ignored.\nThe introductions multiplied. Nobles whose heraldry I didn't even recognize surrounded me, and several ladies tried to put handkerchiefs in my hands as if that meant something, even though, since I wasn't wearing the typical clothes with a pocket on the chest, it was the only way they had to offer them.\nI tried to apply the same tactic I used at the margrave's banquets: smile, nod my head, maintain an unshakable composure. But this was not the same. Compared to this pack, the games at the margrave's court were mere childish gatherings. This was the Imperial court, and here, they didn't come to greet—they came to devour.\nI began to suffocate. Not even being cramped in the formation of my soldiers during a march felt as uncomfortable as this constant pressure. None of those nobles would let me go; they all knew I had been rewarded with gold and war spoils, and they were desperate for a crumb.\nIt didn't take long for chaos to erupt among them. Some started throwing indirect insults disguised as courtesy, airing dirty laundry in public, speaking about economic problems, rumors of scandals, or loss of prestige. All to discredit each other in front of my eyes, as if any of that really mattered to me. But to their misfortune, I didn't care about any of them.\n\"If you'll excuse me... I'm going to try some of the food,\" I said as I tried to push my way through the group of nobles surrounding me, barely able to move a step. My guards had to push firmly, cutting paths and blocking several who tried to follow me like hungry dogs. As for me, I moved quickly, dodging couples dancing in the middle of the hall to the rhythm of the music, making sure I didn't trip over anyone who might embarrass me.\nWhen I reached one of the long banquet tables, guarded by a group of imperial servants—all with refined manners, surely children of minor nobles in decorative positions—I started to serve myself some food, hoping it would be enough to distract the most persistent and give me some respite.\nBut it didn't take long for them to return to harass me. I had barely taken a couple of bites when the same nobles, like vultures, began to surround me again. Until, fortunately, a saving voice echoed through the hall, as if sent by Sigmar himself.\n\"His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Luitpold, Elector Count of Reikland and Prince of Altdorf, accompanied by his son, Prince Karl-Franz!\" shouted one of the Reiksguard members with a loud voice.\nThe entire hall seemed to hold its breath for a second. Members of the Imperial family entered the banquet, escorted by a detachment of the Reiksguard. As expected, many of the nobles who had been harassing me a moment ago rushed like rats to the new target, eager to impress the biggest fish in the hall. Only a few minor nobles remained by my side, the ones still holding onto their hopes in me.\nThe pressure slowly eased. Although they still asked me questions about the campaign or changed the subject every few seconds to offer me their daughters, invite me to dance, or ask me to visit their mansions, the intensity was no longer the same. I simply declined politely, smiled as if I didn't understand their insinuations, and pretended that choosing food took all my attention.\nNow that there weren't so many perfumes mixing in the air, I could breathe more easily, and while I searched for something with fewer spices—that wouldn't look suspicious or cause indigestion—I felt something change in the atmosphere. A wave of footsteps was approaching.\nI turned around and confirmed the inevitable: the Emperor was heading directly towards me, accompanied by his son, Karl-Franz.\nI made sure to have the right posture, stood up straight, and prepared myself for whatever was coming.\nIt didn't take long for the Emperor to be standing right in front of me, surrounded by members of the Reiksguard who formed a protective circle around us.\n\"I've heard something, young Graf…\" said the Emperor.\n\"What happened? Is there something I should know?\" I asked with interest, looking directly at him.\n\"No… something you didn't report in detail, ha, ha,\" replied the Emperor with a light laugh.\n\"Something I didn't report? I'm sure I detailed everything that corresponded as part of the war loot, Your Majesty,\" I responded seriously.\n\"I mean that you didn't mention anything about crushing three more Bretonnian ducal armies during your campaign. While I was talking to the Archlector about your city rights, he informed me that you defeated three more dukes. I was quite surprised... considering I don't know anyone who forgets to mention something so important,\" said the Emperor with a curious smile.\nI slapped my hand to my face and hit my forehead with my gauntlet. \"I knew I'd forgotten something... I apologize, Your Majesty. That could have changed many of the decisions regarding the army that replaced me.\"\n\"There's nothing to apologize for… in fact, this makes the campaign much easier than I expected. Four Bretonnian ducal armies crushed... that news will cheer many regarding the results. I just find it curious that you forgot something so important... I'll think of something to reward you. But for now, I'm more interested in you meeting my son, Karl-Franz, with Sigmar's blessing, future Emperor and heir to my lands,\" said the Emperor while pointing to a tall young man.\nAlthough I was nearly a head taller than him, he had determined eyes. There was something in his gaze... admiration? Hard to tell. His shoulders were broad, his posture firm. It was the legendary Franz.\n\"Graf Albrecht, His Imperial Majesty,\" I said, extending my hand, realizing too late that I had forgotten the formalities. It was too late now: I had already extended my arm.\nI looked at those present, expecting some judgment for my oversight, but only heard the prince's laughter.\n\"Ha, ha… Karl-Franz, Graf. It's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard stories about you... although at first, we thought they were about your father since you both share the same name,\" said the prince, shaking my hand with a smile.\n\"I hope they were the good ones, Your Majesty. You have no idea what the Bretonnians must be saying about me, ha, ha,\" I responded with a light laugh, resting my hands on my waist and making the metal of my armor clink.\nThe Emperor began to withdraw, taking many of the nobles with him, leaving part of the Reiksguard with us.\n\"Only the good ones… about how Sigmar seemed to smile upon you in every battle, or how you inspired your men to face the Bretonnians, pushing them to give it all for the Empire,\" said the young prince in a firm voice.\n\"Bah... that was collective work. The Empire remains strong as long as each person knows their place on the battlefield,\" I replied, pointing to the nearby food table.\nThere, we had a pleasant conversation about my campaigns. No noble interrupted us while we spoke, and for a moment, the noise of the hall seemed to fade away. We talked for what felt like hours until the banquet began to near its end.\n------------------------------Follow current novᴇls on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

So, I took the first ship I found heading toward Schilderheim.\nFrom there, I mounted a horse and rode toward my lands, accompanied by all my guards. We finally arrived in the city, which had changed so much during these months of absence. It was a long and exhausting journey, but one filled with economic benefits that could turn me into one of the great players in the political game… though that will take time, unless I find ways to increase my population and provide them with a place to live, which remains the main problem.\nUpon arrival, just before noon, I found relative chaos. There was a strong presence of witch hunters patrolling the streets, occasionally entering the houses of citizens as if it were nothing.\n\"The consequence… I suppose,\" I murmured as I saw the agents of the Cult of Sigmar working tirelessly.\nAs much as I would have liked to sleep to recover from the lost sleep during the Bretonnian campaign, now I had to worry about the Bretonnian serfs I brought back as souvenirs. I had to act fast to prevent these future contributors — and cannon fodder, if necessary — from becoming a breeding ground for diseases first.\nI went to look for my men, but they hadn't arrived yet. Even with three days' head start, the peasants hadn't managed to keep up with us; the forced march we made in one day would probably take them several. So, it was better to deliver the good — or bad — news right away.\nI headed to see the most important person in the city who wasn't me… nor Hieronymus.\nUpon arriving at the construction site for my Sigmarite school, I found Otto more relaxed than usual. He even seemed rested.\n\"Ah… my lord baron,\" he said, opening his arms to greet me with a sincere smile I hadn't seen in a long time.\n\"I see you're in a good mood… which is rare. What's happened?\" I asked the architect.\n\"Ha, ha. Why wouldn't I be? Especially when the sewer system of your city is finally complete. In its entirety. All the houses in Reinsfeld are now connected to one of the best sewer systems in the Empire. Your school is progressing wonderfully, the houses are up to date even with the arrival of almost ten thousand people — families of the militia members. I can proudly say we're on track with all the work,\" Otto said, smiling, striking a victorious pose.\n\"I'm glad to hear that… because I come with work for you,\" I responded, also smiling, and I saw his smile immediately fade.\n\"What kind of work?\" he asked seriously, looking at me intently.\n\"Oh, just a little thing… soon, another three thousand militiamen will arrive, and they'll also need houses for their families. So, another group of Reiklanders will be coming to the city. And well… now that Merxheim has passed into my property, I'd like you to turn it into a city capable of housing about sixty thousand Bretonnians who are on their way to work my lands,\" I said to the architect, who was left wide-eyed.\n\"Sixty thousand!? What the hell is wrong with you, you crazy bastard!? Do you know how much work that means? I don't have the capacity to handle what you're asking for! It's… it's… insane!\" Otto exclaimed, completely shocked.\n\"Ha, ha… hey, watch that tongue, Otto. Some people have been killed for less… but don't worry. I'll leave it all in your competent hands. And of course, don't worry about the funds. I have enough gold to literally bathe in it…\" I said while imagining myself swimming in a pool of floating molten gold.\n\"Well… that reassures me… a little,\" Otto said with a serious look. \"But I'll have to call in some colleagues… well, EVERYONE I know for a job of this level. It's not feasible to distribute them in small construction groups. I'll have to work nonstop to get this at least partially ready for winter. Because I suppose you're going to pressure me like Sigmar himself to get everything ready by then, right, baron?\"\n\"Graf. It's Graf now, thanks to Emperor Luitpold,\" I corrected him.\n\"Graf…\" Otto murmured, resigned.\n\"Yes… get to work as soon as possible because they'll be arriving soon. And if you need the Bretonnian serfs to do anything, just let me know. I speak their language. In fact, I'm the only one who does… hmm, this is going to be problematic…\" I said, thinking about the complications that would arise.\n\"Of course I'll do it… I learned a little Bretonnian at university, I think I could make myself understood, but don't expect miracles. When they arrive, have them start cutting trees around Merxheim… and have them inspect them. It's known that there are goblins or beastmen in the area, or at least that's what some workers who supply me with materials told me, so a quick cleanup wouldn't hurt,\" said Otto.\n\"I'll make sure it's done. As soon as my men arrive, we'll march to take a look at the forests. We'll go loaded with axes to pave a road and cut the trees for the city's future expansion… Take care, and bring as many workers as you can,\" I said with a smile as I headed back to my horse.\nI saw Otto begin to cover his face with his hands and silently scream as I walked away toward the castle.\nWhen I arrived, I found it almost empty, except for a few guards watching the door. I had left the castle nearly empty, taking all my men-at-arms with me for the campaign and leaving only the bare minimum to allow the entry and exit of tax collectors.\nMy guards quickly recognized me and cleared the way. They all began to spread out across the castle to restore it to its previous state, as dust and cobwebs had accumulated everywhere.\nI headed to my office. It was the only well-maintained area; the hallways leading directly to my quarters were spotless, but upon entering, I found a mountain of paperwork on my work desk.\nI rang the room bell, which still worked, and a guard quickly entered.\n\"How may I serve you, my lord... Graf?\" he asked with some nervousness.\n\"Do you have any idea what all this is?\" I said, staring at the mountain of documents as I began to flip through them slowly.\n\"These are papers brought by the tax collectors and the witch hunters, my lord. They haven't stopped working since more and more migrants started arriving in your lands,\" he replied.\n\"Go find them if you can. I need them to make a summary,\" I ordered, fully focused on the papers.\nThe guard didn't respond; he simply ran off.\n\"This is a census of a new farming land... this should go in the land registry book,\" I murmured, taking the corresponding book from the library and filing the sheet.\n\"This is from a new craftsman who makes wooden furniture... they gave him the book, and these are his latest earnings during the months I was away,\" I said, searching for the tax record of the craftsmen.\n\"Wait... wait... these are purchase requests for commercial patents to operate in the city market... pending approval... Damn, this is gold ready to enter my coffers! Why hasn't anyone approved them?\" I said, grinding my teeth.\n\"And this?... Damn... the witch hunters. Interrogation reports, a bunch of documents pointing out suspicious patterns in certain citizens, trial requests... 84? What the hell is wrong with those Sigmarites? Are they crazy? 84 trials? I haven't had one in over a year!\" I exclaimed, surprised to see that one of the huge piles of papers was only witch hunter reports.\nWhile I continued organizing the paperwork, I was sorting contracts, filing the tax documentation for the craftsmen, accepting commercial patents, and transcribing the fiscal information of the new merchants.\nAs I kept working, organizing the paperwork and pulling empty books to use as new containers for documentation, it wasn't long before the captain of the witch hunters appeared at my castle.\nHe was exactly as I had imagined: a gaunt face, a stern expression, and a gaze that seemed to judge my soul the moment he entered. But, in an instant, his face changed, forming a smile that was almost forced.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, Baron von Reinsfeld,\" said the witch hunter, making the twin-tailed comet salute, moving his fingers in the symbol gesture.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, Captain... I inform you that I am now Graf,\" I responded, mimicking his salute.\n\"Noted, servant of Sigmar,\" he said without losing composure.\n\"Good... I need a summary of this,\" I pointed to the pile of documentation that still occupied half the desk.\n\"It's the result of the investigations we've conducted in compliance with the agreement with the cult and your lordship. Here is the information on heretics and sinners. Yesterday I received authorization to enter homes without the need for proof, something I am applying with the members of the cult,\" explained the captain in a formal tone.\n\"That decision was made yesterday... Information travels fast, doesn't it?\" I commented, surprised by how quickly bureaucracy moves when it comes to Sigmar.\n\"When it's about safeguarding the people of our god and lord Sigmar, one can never be too fast... Graf,\" he replied coldly.\n\"Of course... Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? We were never introduced, for reasons beyond my control,\" I said, raising an eyebrow.\n\"Jonas Krüger, Graf,\" he responded firmly.\n\"Well, Jonas. When would it be possible to start the trials?\" I asked, interested.\n\"As soon as possible, if necessary, my lord. We have the accused in the Sigmarite temple dungeons, which have been expanded to accommodate the number of prisoners this city has. It would be prudent—if I may recommend—that you try to establish a judge for this task. The longer some heretics remain alive, the more their stain will spread through the city. I understand you were serving the Empire in Bretonnia, but you have neglected your spiritual and noble duties here,\" he said sternly.\n\"I'll try to bring members of the Cult of Verena to the city so the courts can start functioning as soon as possible. I hope you understand, Captain, that I was planning to do so, but duty called sooner than I would have liked,\" I said, joining my fingers together.\n\"I understand. But, as I stated, I need that to move quickly. We have all the necessary evidence for these people to be burned or punished according to the law, and it's a problem that we must wait for your decision in each case, as we cannot act summarily—although we are authorized by the demonic state of emergency,\" replied the witch hunter.\n\"They are authorized to act as you see fit, as long as they provide evidence and inform me. That's what I discussed with the Archlector,\" I responded with a smile.\n\"Just as I received it... So, will you be the one to handle the trials now? Or should I keep postponing them, or do you authorize me to apply justice as I deem necessary?\" said the witch hunter, walking slowly around the room, inspecting some books.\n\"I have a lot to do today. I'll go out to call members of the Cult of Verena right now. If we're lucky, tomorrow or the day after, we'll have judges for all your cases,\" I indicated.\n\"May I recommend members of the Cult of Sigmar as judges? I believe it would be better for heretical cases against Sigmar to be seen by a priest and servant of Sigmar. It would be much more prudent than leaving them in their hands,\" insisted the captain.\n\"I'll take that into consideration... If you have nothing else to report, Captain, you may leave,\" I said, looking at him coldly.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nThe smile disappeared from his face. Without saying a word, he began to leave the room.\n\"The headache with them... it's only beginning, isn't it?\" I murmured, looking at the ceiling of my office.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The idea in general is good.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------\nSommerzeit--5,2489 IC\n\"Ready… damn,\" I said as I put all the books on the shelf. \"So much paperwork that just needed a signature.\" I turned to look at the mountain of witch hunters' reports.\nI had quickly reviewed most of the investigations. They were mostly legitimate, with reasonable doubts: people disappearing on certain nights and no one knowing what they were doing until they eventually found a group performing rituals with animal blood. Others were minor offenses that weren't directly under the hunters' jurisdiction, but since they had wasted time investigating them, they wanted to punish them with some lashes as a lesson.\nThat's why I sent a letter to the Cult of Verena in Altdorf asking them to send me a group of their younger members, if possible, to serve as judges in my courts. With at least five or ten diligent, hardworking judges, it should be enough for the city for now, until we build the necessary courthouses to handle the inevitably growing judicial load. Because now, with the witch hunters acting like they were on steroids, those 84 initial cases would quickly turn into hundreds, if not thousands, that would need to be dealt with according to the law.\nI also added that I would try to bring in graduates from the University of Altdorf to see if it was possible to delegate some of my responsibilities to them, although…\nStill, I had work to do. A pseudo-revolt had occurred in my mining town: the inhabitants from Ostermark and Ostland had started fighting among themselves, causing many injuries in a large brawl. The exact origin of the fight was unknown, but considering the history of tensions between Imperial provinces, I had no doubt it was due to a simple pride issue over where they were born.\nFor the last few days, they hadn't been working as tensions remained high. Everyone was waiting to see which side would attack the other first.\n\"I literally disappear, and people start killing each other as if my authority ceases to exist just because I left,\" I said angrily when I heard the guards' report from the mine. For obvious reasons, they couldn't control the disturbances. Forty men can't stop over a thousand angry protesters.\nSo, I sent one of the guard captains, accompanied by five hundred soldiers, to remind them what happens when they rebel over stupid things. A little tough love would probably put them back in their place.\nAt the same time, cross accusations started emerging among citizens: everyone was pointing fingers in front of the witch hunters. Luckily, they didn't have the legal authority to accept popular accusations without evidence, otherwise we'd have bonfires lit for two months straight.\nWhile I started reorganizing the militias to control the situation, my personal army finally arrived: the 2,800 soldiers that belonged directly to me and the 3,000 men from regiments that had previously served other nobles.\nI immediately put them to patrol the streets and impose order. I also ordered them to discreetly monitor the witch hunters because they were now operating without coordinating with the local militia. They were completely on their own, and many of their interactions with citizens could end with a peasant stabbed by a sword or blasted by a blessed pistol.\nSo, while all the gold I received from my participation in Bretonia was being stored, I began issuing orders to hire more workers and continue expanding the industry that fed construction. I ordered hiring many more brickmakers, building more furnaces, hiring more charcoal burners, woodcutters, and commissioning the construction of three additional blast furnaces. I also ordered employing people to bind sheets of paper with goat leather to make books, as the files were starting to multiply.\nI had the Breton horses sent to my private stables so that the families in charge of their care would do everything possible to breed them with Imperial horses. Hopefully, I'd get a stronger and faster lineage for future generations.\nAlso, I left the bodies of the fallen at the Morr temple so that they could be buried with all the proper rites. I gave gold coins to the families of the deceased, through their comrades in arms, assuring them that I would continue paying the deceased's salary under the conditions I had already established.\nWithout wasting any time, I began to move the group of Bretonnians that had arrived. They were preparing makeshift beds, but we immediately redirected them towards Merxheim. We passed by the blacksmith's shop in my industrial zone and took all the available axes. I ordered all the draft horses to be gathered, as the work had to be done quickly and relatively safely while we were present.\nWe crossed the river and took the dirt road to Merxheim.\nBeing further away from the witch hunters, I could once again unleash my magical abilities without fear of their inquisitive gazes. I began to expand my perception in the great forest of Merxheim.\nI sensed a great number of crude and misshapen machetes: it was certain there were Beastmen. I also felt the aura of corrupt objects, that foul sensation in the mouth, concentrated in the center of the forest. It was very likely a large herd. Additionally, I picked up signs of goblin presence: small knives and arrow tips in some nearby caves. Probably Sylvan goblins. So when we started cleaning the forests, we would be met with brief fights against Beastmen and constant harassments from hidden goblins.\nIn any case, we had to make the most of the day. Winter was getting closer.\nAs soon as I arrived in Merxheim on horseback, I went to inform the local noble — who managed the land on behalf of the Elector Count of Reikland — that these lands were now mine, and they needed to leave immediately.\nWith a group of two hundred riders, we arrived at the town and headed to the castle, which was mostly made of wood. I clearly saw that it was a large town, a commercial transit hub located between the maritime routes of Marienburg and Altdorf, but it failed to attract any true interest. I saw with my own eyes how several merchant ships passed by without stopping. There were no river ports, they could only watch them pass. The town remained a poor spectator of the flow of wealth.\nMy plan wasn't to keep the Bretonnians in simple barracks. I intended to use them as labor to build a new city by the Reik River. A city that would attract naval merchants, compete directly with Schilderheim, and eventually steal the spotlight as a docking point. My city would be designed to absorb that wealth, charge docking fees, taxes, and serve as a distribution hub for my own goods.\nBecause so far, the merchants who come to Reinsfeld are small or medium-sized. I haven't seen any large ones coming to trade or buy serious patents.\nA relatively young noble quickly came out, accompanied by some guards.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, administrator,\" I said, making the twin-tailed comet salute.\n\"Blessings, noble Imperial,\" responded the administrator, mimicking the salute, though more briefly.\nI took out the scroll granting me rights over Merxheim and handed it to him.\n\"By order of the Emperor, Elector Count of Reikland and Prince of Altdorf, the fief of Merxheim has been granted to the ownership of my family in perpetuity. And so, I formally request that you cede control of the castle to me, to take my rightful claim,\" I said to the administrator, who took the scroll and began to read it.\n\"Yes, indeed... Well, I'm off,\" said the administrator, barely trying to hide the huge grin that appeared on his face.\n\"Hold on,\" I said, looking at him seriously. \"What kind of reaction is that?\"\n\"The most normal one,\" he responded, shrugging. \"I'm not going to stay in this hellhole. I accepted the position because it was an order from the Emperor, thinking I'd have large farmlands and serfs at my disposal. But the Beastmen attack every week, and there's barely any arable land. This place has no future. The problem is now yours. I'm heading back to Altdorf and the Emperor's court. Any place is better than this.\"\nThe guards who accompanied him stood there, looking at him with wide eyes, not saying a word.\n\"Then leave my land,\" I said, with little interest.\n\"You don't have to tell me twice,\" replied the noble before entering the castle. It wasn't long before he came back out with a carriage that looked like it had been made by the finest craftsmen of Altdorf. Accompanied by a group of knights, he left the castle like a gust of wind.\n\"Is it really that bad?\" I asked one of the guards, who was looking lazily as his former lord left so happily.\n\"Things are bad because... because he spent everything on expensive wines and fine meals from some merchants. We barely had permanent guards. The Beastmen have attacked several times, killing some and taking others into the forest,\" responded the guard with a bitter voice.\n\"Typical of a city noble,\" I spat on the ground. \"Well, listen. I'm bringing around three thousand men. We're going to clean up the forests as soon as possible.\"\n\"Really?... By Sigmar... our prayers have been heard,\" said another guard, his eyes shining.\n\"Yes... that's the plan,\" I confirmed. \"But listen well: a large group of Bretonnians is coming to these lands. Some will stay permanently, others just for a while. They will help us cut trees to move the forest as far from the city as possible. It's too close, and it makes it easier for the Beastmen to move.\"\n\"Grail worshippers?\" asked one of the guards, visibly disgusted.\n\"Yes, those. Here, everyone must cooperate to make this move quickly. So, anyone with the strength and ability to work will do it. That's my first order as your lord: help cut trees and uproot roots. We're going to leave this area spotless. These lands will be a great granary for Reikland when we're done,\" I said seriously, turning around immediately as the guards headed towards the village to spread the news.\nWhen the first Bretonnian servants arrived, I quickly started giving orders. Since I was the only one who knew Bretonnian, it was my duty to ensure they understood what they were being told. I left a group in charge of preparing food, while others began setting up their small logging camps. I distributed the large group of people into eight camps, all protected by a small garrison of my men, and positioned them along the road to Merxheim.\nIt wasn't long before the first gunshot from a musket was heard. The Beastmen had started to emerge from the forest, drawn by the large number of humans in the area. But this time, they weren't facing peasants armed with sticks or poorly trained troops from some random noble. They were facing veterans seasoned in clearing the forests of the Empire and soldiers hardened by the war in Bretonnia. As soon as the Beastmen were spotted by the musketeers, they fell under a hail of lead without the chance to respond.\nAs soon as the first camps and palisades were set up, the axes began felling trees relentlessly. The huge Bretonnian labor force worked with axes, horses, and ropes to guide the falling trunks, as the landscape slowly cleared with the fall of the old trees. The horses and serfs pulled up the stumps with effort, cleaning every meter of land.\nThe work took an incredibly fast rhythm. Every hour, dozens of trees fell. Gradually, we moved the forest away from the road and Merxheim village, opening space for new roads, farms, and settlements. Throughout the day, hundreds of trees fell, accumulating in large piles. It was only the first of many days of clearing. Tomorrow, after my troops had rested a bit, we'd pay the Beastmen a visit.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet",

This is a unique opportunity... We'll be among the youngest judges the Empire has ever had, and in Reinsfeld of all places!\" exclaimed one of my companions, overflowing with enthusiasm.\n\"Who would have thought that being assistants at the entrance of the temple would lead us here…\" I responded, still incredulous, as I adjusted the buckle of my tunic.\n\"I never would have imagined it,\" added another aspirant, catching the same fervor.\nThe young man from Reinsfeld, Albrecht von Reinsfeld, was a constant topic of conversation in Altdorf. At his young age, he had gained fame for his political cunning, and, according to rumors, for being a brilliant commander. Unlike other nobles, he didn't seek out the old scholars of the Cult of Verena: he wanted new blood. He specifically requested young members from the temple, well-versed in laws and logic, to fill positions in the new courts of his city.\nIt was a matter of fortune, or perhaps one of those ironies that the goddess so cherishes, that the servant who came to the temple to deliver the request found himself exactly where several of us were working cataloging and filing. We were apprentices, aspiring librarians, or minor scribes. And we met the one requirement the Graf asked for: youth.\nAlmost all of us present were chosen, much to the silent disdain of the higher-ranking temple members, who, curiously, had not been informed of the offer in advance. Some accused us of being opportunists. Others, more quietly, of betraying the hierarchy. But Verena teaches us to seek truth and justice, not to blindly obey outdated customs.\nIn less than a week, our names were officially accepted, and we were informed that we would be traveling to Reinsfeld to serve judicial functions on behalf of the Cult. We were embarked on a river journey towards Merxheim, one of the Graf's possessions, where we would make the transfer to the city.\nThe trip, though brief, left us stunned. Not by the movement of the boat—though several suffered from seasickness—but by the surprising number of workers boarding with us. Dozens of them, perhaps hundreds, all laborers with tools slung over their shoulders, heading to the same destination. The boats filled with rough men from various provinces. Many came from Averland, Stirland, even from the north.\nWe spent the journey talking about our good fortune and speculating about the Graf. They said he was tall, imposing, but better known for his brain than his sword. For most of us, this was our first time outside Altdorf. Leaving the capital for a city in deep Reikland might have seemed like madness… if not for the fact that it meant a direct promotion within the Cult.\nMerxheim received us with rusticity. The port was new, improvised. Newly placed planks still unvarnished. Even so, the ships began to dock in an orderly fashion, and the crew disembarked shouting orders. First, the workers disembarked, then some architects dressed in colorful tunics that clashed with the dust of the place.\nFinally, we were called.\nA servant of the Graf, dressed in blue red livery signaled for us to follow him. He pointed to a tall figure covered in full armor that gleamed under the sun. We approached respectfully.\nThe knight slowly removed his helmet. The face he revealed seemed sculpted from marble deep blue eyes, pale blonde hair, and a strong jaw that inspired authority even in silence. He took a step toward us.\n\"Greetings, Graf. We are—\" He didn't let me finish. He simply looked away toward someone beside him.\n\"Otto, these are your colleagues,\" he said firmly, addressing a hunched man, with a gaunt face and deep bags under his eyes.\n\"Yes, they are,\" Otto responded without bothering to greet us. The tone he used with the Graf would have warranted punishment in any court… but the young noble barely seemed to notice.\n\"Perfect. Follow me. We have much to discuss.\" The Graf shook hands with each architect respectfully, took them with him toward the village… and left us there, in the middle of the bustling port, standing like statues.\nIt took him quite some time to return.\n\"Are you from the Cult of Verena, or am I mistaken?\" asked the Graf, not raising his voice, as his cold, calculating gaze scanned us.\n\"Yes, honorable noble of the Empire. We are servants of the goddess Verena, protector of knowledge and justice,\" I responded with the expected manners, bowing slightly.\n\"Good. Follow me,\" he said curtly, turning immediately to walk into the forest.\nWe exchanged confused looks among ourselves. Without an explanation, the Graf spoke to some of his men, who immediately formed an escort behind us. We walked in silence, entering the trees.\n\"Excuse me, my lord,\" I said after a few minutes, raising my voice with some apprehension. \"Why are we walking into the forest? Shouldn't we be going to the city?\"\nThe Graf did not stop. His tone was low, but as firm as steel.Follow current novᴇls on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"I want to make something clear from the beginning. I know how the Cult of Verena works. I know about veiled alliances, favors disguised as jurisprudence, judges who sell themselves to the highest bidder or bow to witch hunters out of fear. I will not tolerate that on my lands.\"\nI didn't know what to answer. The silence that followed was as dense as the humidity in the forest.\nThat was when we heard it: a guttural, grotesque grunt, full of rage. Something was moving between the trees. We turned toward the sound just in time to see an abominable creature emerge: a Beastman, muscular, covered in scars and filthy hair, with twisted horns and a huge piece of sharp iron as a weapon.\nSome of us tried to step back, but the Graf's guards held us by the arms. Not violently, but firmly. They wouldn't let us escape.\nThe beast roared and charged toward the Graf.\nThe young noble, without a word, drew a sword that gleamed with a faint metallic glow. He didn't dodge the strike: he anticipated it. He stepped aside almost elegantly, and in one fluid motion, he cut off the creature's arm. Blood gushed, splattering him. One of the apprentices fell to her knees, vomiting.\nThe Graf didn't stop. He delivered a brutal punch to the creature's chest, the crack audible, followed by another dry blow to the throat. The beast staggered, its eyes bulging, gasping as though drowning. Then, the Graf grabbed it by the neck with both arms and began choking it, walking slowly toward us.\nThe smell was unbearable. The stench of blood surrounded us. The creature writhed, hit, tried to free itself… but the Graf didn't yield. His muscles were tense, his face showing pure concentration, his demeanor… it was like watching a statue of Sigmar.\n\"This,\" he said in a deep voice while the creature gasped for breath, \"is a beastman. Perhaps many of you have never seen one. Well, here you have it.\"\nThe monster kicked with less force. Its eyes began to roll back. Still, the Graf didn't loosen his grip.\n\"If any of you… any of you… dares to accept a bribe, manipulate a judgment for political favors, or betray the balance of my courts by obeying fanatics or witch hunters, I swear by Sigmar that I will break your arms and legs myself. And I will leave you here, in the forest, to be devoured by things like this while I watch. Is that clear?\"\nWith a swift twist of his arms, the final crack echoed. The beastman's neck snapped with a horrific sound, and its body fell to the ground like a sack of dead meat. Some of us stepped back. One companion started crying. Another pissed himself.\nThe Graf stepped forward, covered in blood.\n\"Is that clear?\" he repeated, this time raising his voice with a thunderous authority that seemed to shake even the leaves on the trees.\n\"Yes! Yes, my lord!\" we answered almost in unison.\n\"Take them to the city... they now understand what will happen,\" the Graf ordered while wiping the blood from the beastman with a piece of linen handed to him by one of his men.\nHe didn't say anything else. He turned and disappeared into the trees, leaving his soldiers the task of escorting us. We were still trembling. No one spoke. The fear hadn't gone away; it had settled in our chests like a cold stone.\nWe were loaded onto transport carts, drawn by well-fed horses. No one asked where we were going, though we knew: to Reinsfeld. The journey wasn't long, but it felt eternal. Some cried in silence. Others murmured prayers to Verena, not even raising their voices. No one looked back at the forest we had come from.\nWhen we arrived at Reinsfeld, the first thing that struck us was the planning. It wasn't just a simple rural settlement: it was a city in expansion. We were led to a new district, with straight streets and orderly facades on the buildings. Not far away, the towers of the Graf's castle loomed, always visible, as though watching over every street from above.\n\"With some luck,\" whispered one of my companions, \"we might be able to run to the castle if anything goes wrong.\"\nOne by one, the soldiers handed us keys and papers. Each of us was assigned our own residence. Slate roofs, thick oak doors, windows with iron shutters. Mine looked like it came straight from the high quarters of Altdorf. As soon as I crossed the threshold, all I wanted was to take off my clothes, wash my hands, and forget about the day.\nI entered. The house was furnished. In the main room, in front of a small fireplace that was still unlit, there was a statue of Sigmar, polished, without a speck of dust. It seemed out of place.\nI reached out toward the statue… and in that instant, the door slammed shut behind me.\nI spun around suddenly. My heart was pounding. A figure emerged from the shadows of the hallway, walking steadily. He wore a long black leather coat, crisscrossed with straps. The wide-brimmed hat partially covered his face, but his voice was unmistakable.\n\"Blessed Sigmar... the world drowns in corruption. Your Empire cracks under heresy. The faithful die while the wicked multiply... Blessed Sigmar, grant me the strength to purge the corrupt, to bring hope where hope has lost.\"\nOnly then did I see his face. It was a man with angular features, weathered by years of war. He had scars on his jaw and neck. A witch hunter.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, servant of Verena,\" he said, moving closer. \"Jonas Krüger, captain of the witch hunters assigned to Reinsfeld.\"Before I could speak, he placed his leather-gloved hand firmly over my lips.\n\"I'll be clear,\" he said. \"In Reinsfeld, you are under the protection of the Graf. Within its boundaries, I cannot touch you. But outside... you are at my mercy. And I am a patient man.\"His words were soft, but his tone was loaded with threat.\n\"I have been assigned to protect this city not only from heretics but also from my own brethren. Those who, blinded by fanaticism, punish the innocent while the true evil mocks them from the shadows.\" He came even closer. I could smell the leather of his coat, the gunpowder from his weapons.\n\"There are certain cases... baseless. Empty accusations. I need you to dismiss them tomorrow. Do not investigate them. Just let them be free. And if you don't…\" He paused. \"If you don't, when you take one step outside this city… no one will ever know of you again. No one.\"\nHe turned, opened the door, and left. From the threshold, he threw one last look at me.\nOnly then did I notice I wasn't the only one.\nAt the doors of the other houses in the district, more witch hunters were also leaving. One for each house. One for each judge.\nOur companions emerged horrified, pale, their lips pressed tight. We looked at each other… and understood that we had all received the same visit. The same warning.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

A group of witch hunters was politically at odds with another inside the city. Luckily, there were no records of physical fights, but there were constant clashes between two factions: on one side, the unbearable fanatics who tried to start illegal investigations every time someone said they suspected a woman of being a witch; and on the other, those who preferred to observe, investigate thoroughly, and gather evidence before asking for the purifying fire. Though they didn't shy away from torture, as one of the latest trials—led by the captain of that faction—ended with ten people burned for performing rituals with animal blood. It was an exhaustive investigation, the trial was quick, and the public execution followed. Despite their methods, at least this faction respected imperial laws, used informants, and worked together with the guards. They were fewer than half, but while their captain was in charge, they were the most tolerable of all.\nAnd if that meant the others would bother me less, I was grateful. Because the cases multiplied, just as I had predicted. From eighty, it had gone up to almost a thousand in just a few days. Fortunately, more than eighty percent were dismissed by the judges due to lack of evidence, although some cases continued due to suspicious actors within the population, and there was enough evidence to proceed with investigations.\nAs for me, I dedicated myself to cleaning up the damn forest of Merxheim, which was plagued by beastmen. The poor management of the land in recent years had allowed them to multiply uncontrollably. According to the local population, many women had been kidnapped during the past winters, while the old administrator didn't lift a finger, as long as the attacks didn't reach his castle.\nSo, through the lector from Reinsfeld, I informed the Cult of Sigmar of my discovery: we were possibly facing a heretic who collaborated with the beastmen or tolerated them.\nMeanwhile, my men and I continued the cleaning of the forest and the felling of trees. We had already managed to push the forest's edge almost six kilometers back from Merxheim and its roads. We quickly began the work to convert the recovered land into arable plots, using heavy plows and horses. The work was almost endless, but the Bretonnian peasants proved to be incredibly efficient, setting up fields while respecting certain key trees to protect future crops from the wind. We left triple rows of oaks every three kilometers to form stable plots. The Bretonnian serfs were already working at full speed, trying to plant something before winter arrived, though we were at least a season behind on the plowing calendar.\nStill, with the forests so full of beastmen, I had been mainly focused on moving the garrisons while the trees were felled slowly but steadily, leaving only those that would serve as natural protection for the future farms. At the same time, we began planting new trees in strategic locations to ensure adequate coverage and reinforce the boundaries that would separate the forest from the cultivation areas.\nSince everything seemed to be in order, I decided to visit my mining village and, along the way, my hidden laboratory.\nRiding without much hurry, I arrived in a few hours. The village had regained some calm since the guards had given a tremendous beating to everyone involved in the riots. Now, most of them worked without problems, though some simply sat on the sidelines, with broken legs or arms. Predictable consequences of the repression I ordered, but necessary to impose order in an area that had decided to fight over absurd territorial disputes, with no sense in a civilized land like Reikland.\nAfter verifying that everything was running—at least as much as it could run in a place recently crushed by force—I headed toward the fortress, which was beginning to resemble one due to the constant work of the dwarfs, who didn't stop for a moment.\nI watched as they laid brick after brick, using their special mortar that fused the rock with perfect precision. I also saw them reinforcing interior areas, carefully preparing the foundations, while the structure took a solid, compact shape. Finally, I descended to the deepest level, where the laboratory was finished.\nAll the sections were installed. The runes carved on the walls and doors were complete. The interior metal walls had the appropriate inscriptions, protections against demons, against visions of the future, against accidents caused by the use of acids or dangerous substances. The place was armored against almost any eventuality.\nInside, the dwarfs were already working efficiently, producing pigments and large quantities of gunpowder. The demand was constant, especially since Rutger had to bring cotton from Araby in every one of his shipments when he returned.\n\"Dawongi!\" one of the dwarfs said, whom I recognized as the clan's engineer, opening his arms enthusiastically.\n\"Greetings, honorable dawi. It's good to return to a place with friendly faces,\" I responded, extending my hand to receive a strong handshake.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n\"Everything is going according to plan, dawongi. The laboratory you requested from our clan is fully operational. The fortress that protects it should be ready in the next few months. It will be the best fortress in the Empire. Nothing will be able to destroy it,\" the dwarf said with evident pride.\n\"I'm glad to hear that... As for our deal... I see that you're producing gunpowder. Should I assume you've found clients, or not?\" I asked with a smile.\n\"Ah, you have a good eye, dawongi... The answer to that question is yes. It took quite a while to get them to buy it, as it was something so novel, but some clans showed interest in trying it. The caravan that transports the products is still out, as they tried to take it to Karaz-a-Karak. However, some of our envoys have returned confirming orders. Many engineers want to try it in their repeating firearms, as a common problem was that the cannons clogged when they used too much black powder. With smokeless powder, that problem almost disappears, so in every fortress they've gone to, they've bought it. We have so many buyers that we can't keep up. The amount of cotton we bring is very little,\" explained the dawi engineer.\n\"I see. The problem lies, honorable engineer, in that we have to bring it from Araby, since cotton is not grown in the Empire. It could be attempted in Averland, but they only care for their cattle and farmland. I don't think they want to risk planting cotton… But I have an idea. An idea I've had for a while, but… I don't know how to make it a reality. Although I'm sure a dawi with as much knowledge as you could easily help me with this dilemma, right?\" I asked the dawi, who was listening attentively.\n\"Of course… If it can be built, I can try it,\" the dawi responded, puffing his chest with pride.\n\"Look, the mechanics are simple…\" I said, pulling out my notebook with notes. \"It's a glass structure that allows certain plants to grow in ideal conditions, even in winter. The glass must be thick and pure enough to allow sunlight through but capable of maintaining stable temperatures. It should be connected to a water pump so that the plants receive the necessary amount, preferably manually, to avoid drowning them or letting them dry out. If everything goes well, the soil should not freeze during winter, which would leave us with fertile ground to work with all year… and we could have all the cotton we wanted. Therefore, all the gunpowder we can produce,\" I concluded, handing him a sketch where I tried to make the best drawing I could with my limited artistic skills.\n\"Hm… it shouldn't be too hard, dawongi. It's very similar to the underground mushroom farms we have, as they require the control of certain elements. Surely some rune could be used to maintain the temperature of this structure you ask for. How many will we need?\" the engineer asked.\n\"All the possible ones. If we need to fill the prairies outside the mountains with this, so be it. Because, from what I see, we need a lot, but a lot of cotton, right?\"\n\"Yes, too much. Almost everything the umgi named Rutger brings is used up within days, and that's with him bringing more each time. But the purchases from engineers in other dwarven fortresses are many, as they want to make sure the gunpowder is a viable change. Therefore, we'll have secured purchases for at least the next five hundred years, while they make sure everything is in order with your creation, dawongi,\" the engineer replied with a satisfied smile.\n\"Well, that's good,\" I said, noticing a dawi I knew entered the laboratory.\n\"Ah, Durán, my friend, how are you?\" I greeted the thane of the dawi.\n\"Dawongi… fortune smiles upon us, without a doubt. Your invention is on its way to filling our coffers. In your coin, it would be fifteen imperial crowns per ''kilogram'' of your gunpowder, and considering we process tons every day… there's no doubt we'll fill the coffers of our clan and yours,\" said the thane with a firm voice.\n\"I'm glad to hear that. Ah, right… what concerns us. I inform you that I'll be gone for about two to four months, because I've committed to the Cult of Sigmar to help with the cleaning of the Drakwald. As soon as I return from that trip, I'll come back here, and then we'll attempt to clean another of your clan's lost fortresses. With some luck, we could try recovering two, if the temperature inside the tunnels allows it, of course,\" I responded with a smile.\n\"Thank you, dawongi. I'd be grateful for such help in recovering the glory of our clan… We have part of the payments we've received for the gunpowder, for you to take your share, as we agreed,\" Durán said, extending a small chest.\n\"Keep it. I made a request to your engineer, and it will be a lot of work. Use it to pay for their labor so they can help me with the construction of what I requested. It will be a lot of effort, considering they're still working on the fortress,\" I responded, placing my hands on my hips.\n\"I understand, dawongi… Regarding this, a couple of small clans from the fortresses of Karak Azgaraz and Karak Norn want to try settling in our karak. Clearly, that could put our current agreement on mining rights at risk, and I was wondering if some changes could be made. More dawi hands could help maintain what was once the territory of my clan… considering you own the mining rights,\" Durán said, looking at me intently.\n\"Of course… the more dawi, the better. One day we'll recover every single fortress of your clan, and I doubt they can be protected by just a few of yours. So it's fine by me. As long as the dawi have your permission, my mining rights extend to them,\" I replied without hesitation.\n\"Thank you, dawongi. I'll make sure they know they are welcome in our karak and that they'll help with your work,\" Durán said.\n\"No need to thank me, friend. Here, the two of us have a relationship that benefits us both… and I want this to last forever,\" I said with a smile.\nDurán and the engineer smiled at my words.\n\"Well, if you'll excuse me,\" I said, walking toward a room sealed within the laboratory.\n\"Old man… are you here?\" I asked, placing my hand on one of the runes. It glowed, and the door opened slowly.\nInside, I found Hieronymus collapsed on a stone table.\n\"Old man? Don't tell me you're dead…\" I murmured, approaching.\n\"What…? No… I don't want… anymore…\" Hieronymus mumbled, with an empty dwarven beer mug in his hand, almost not knowing where he was.\n\"Ha, ha, ha! What a mess you're causing out there… and look at you now,\" I said, laughing,\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It seemed that after being locked up in the lab for so long with nothing to do, he managed to get along with the dawi, helping them with some alchemical processes that he handled better than many of them. Clearly, the person who had control of one of my notebooks on alchemical formulas mastered certain things much better than the dwarves, who had learned them through experience and practice, but without any knowledge of the theoretical background behind the new technologies.\nWell, they invited him to drink regularly. And every time they did, Hieronymus ended up drunk. Terribly drunk.\nHe then explained to me what had happened. Why demons appeared in Reinsfeld. And it was simple: he didn't want to use magic in the city, not even secretly. With the presence of the witch hunters, the risk of being discovered was enormous. And although very few knew he was tied to me as my financial advisor, it would still have caused problems. So, he made the most direct decision. With almost two hundred and fifty kilograms of blue pigment loaded in a transport cart, he went to look for the von Kesselheim troops.\nHe literally provoked a Chamon storm around him. The power he felt was so immense that he massacred without difficulty three thousand trained soldiers, who could do nothing but die mercilessly. And by leaving such a saturated area of metal magic, it wasn't hard to attract demons, drawn to the massacre or the energy released.\nWe both agreed that, if anyone asked me, I'd simply say that he was now guarding the village and was my representative in dawi matters. Meanwhile, he hides in the laboratory, the safest place in the region to stay out of the witch hunters' or Watchmasters' sight, who must undoubtedly be on alert by now.\nSo, I just made sure the dawi had everything they needed, except cotton, to keep producing more gunpowder.\nWhat I did take from there were several sealed barrels of smokeless gunpowder. I'd need them for my next campaign: to gain the favor of the Cult of Sigmar and a bit of the Ulricans by helping to clean the Drakwald forest.\nThe Merxheim forests, although still filled with beastmen, were slowly being cleaned by the militias. They launched frequent expeditions, not too far, to establish small camps and protect the Bretonnian peasants who continued to work as if possessed by duty. With three meals a day and the promise of a house, they worked happily, with big smiles, until the end of the day.\nI let the militias, which now numbered almost eight thousand men, protect all my settlements. Four thousand stayed in Reinsfeld, while the other four thousand were distributed along the road to Merxheim, with a small fixed garrison in the mining village, preventing the beastmen from causing trouble while we slowly destroyed their habitat.\nI quickly recruited two thousand two hundred men to close the numbers and have five thousand soldiers at my personal service. For a week, I organized their teams, gave them armor, uniforms, and distributed a large number of muskets. Recently, I had ordered a small modification: an improvement in the barrel to allow them to attach a bayonet or, at least, a sharp piece of steel. That way, if they found themselves in the terrible situation of close combat, they'd have a minimal chance of defense.\nHowever, due to the speed of my request, only a hundred muskets with that modification could be made. Meanwhile, the blacksmiths were mass-producing a long piece of very sharp steel.\nSo, with the army ready to mobilize, we began our march toward Schilderheim, where we rented the boats of a local merchant. It was much cheaper to rent a boat than to buy individual tickets for all my men. Quickly and orderly, we crossed the river to Barenfahre, and when the entire army was on the other side, I sent a messenger to the Duke of Carroburg, informing him that my forces were approaching and that they should let us pass without issues.\nThey did so. We were allowed to cross the city, as they were informed that our mission was to clean the nearest forests by direct orders of the Grand Theogonist. We were well received, and some supplies were given to us before we continued.\nWe kept advancing north, and I was surprised by the immense forests of Middenland. Everywhere I looked, there were enormous trees, easily decades, if not centuries, old. But what worried me the most was how close those forests were to the road. There were only a few partially cleared sectors, but not much more than that. Anyone passing by here would realize too late what could be hidden among the trees… when it was already too late to react.\nGoing up to Middenheim would be ideal if I wanted our presence to have the maximum political recognition in cleaning the forests. But being so far, it would delay the arrival of resources, reinforcements, and, above all, the gunpowder I had ordered to be sent to me every week to use the muskets indiscriminately.\nSo, we simply camped near Carroburg.\nIn the village of Grossfurre, we set up our beastmen hunting camp. Heading into the forests, we began unloading all the supplies we had brought: shovels, hammers, nails, axes… and we began cutting trees and pulling trunks around us. We started cleaning the land and setting up a palisade, establishing a military camp with latrines and ditches, as our stay would be prolonged.\nFor several hours, we focused exclusively on getting the camp in good condition, with the tree line pushed back and extensive fortifications to offer provisional defense against the beastmen that inhabited those woods.\nWhen nightfall came, most of the camp was already set up. The guards began organizing the watch shifts, ensuring everything around us remained quiet and that we had enough response time in case of a Chaos attack.\nThe next day, after sleeping and preparing the meals, we finished setting up the camp as it should be. We raised a second wooden palisade, erected watchtowers, and built parapets.\nWith everything ready, we began preparing the traps that were so effective against the beastmen. We sacrificed several pigs brutally, spreading their blood all over the area.\nAnd it didn't take long for me to feel large amounts of metal beginning to move through the thick forest, heading directly toward us.\nIt wasn't long before dozens of musket shots rang out. The beastmen emerged from the forest, only to be gunned down by multiple volleys from our musketeers, who fired mercilessly from atop the walls, covered by the parapets. It was like shooting ducks in the Imperial pond. They charged toward us by the dozens, driven by the blood of their kin, but they found only death.\nThe beastmen massacre lasted nearly two hours. Thousands of their bodies piled up in front of our camp. The scandal was such that the local lord's forces approached, asking if we needed help, until they saw what lay on the other side: literally piles of beastmen corpses who had died trying to reach us.\nNot feeling their presence anymore, we immediately began gathering the bodies and lit a large bonfire. We used their bodies as fuel, taking advantage of the abundant wood from the trees we had cut.\nFor a week, we worked tirelessly, luring beastmen with every trick I had in my arsenal. And it was working. It didn't take long before some minotaurs emerged, crossing the tree line like uncontrolled beasts... only to become huge practice targets for the thousands of musketeers posted on the wooden walls, who fired non-stop at anyone who poked their head out from the forest.\nEverything seemed under control. We continued to eliminate beastmen consistently, while the blood of their fallen comrades acted as bait for more of them.\nIn one of those rare moments of peace, when the men took the opportunity to clean their weapons, refill their powder pouches, a sizable cavalry contingent arrived, carrying the insignia of Ulric.The most update n0vels are published on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nI went to meet them. Each of them wore plate armor and a thick wolfskin piece over their shoulders.\n\"For Ulric!\" said one of them, pounding his chest forcefully as he dismounted.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar,\" I replied without making the hand gesture.\nThe Ulrican snorted loudly before speaking.\n\"So, you are the Sigmarites who came to help us clean the Drakwald? Building a small fortification doesn't do much if you don't clean the woods…\" said the Ulrican.\n\"Graf Albrecht von Reinsfeld, at the service of the Grand Theogonist and the Cult of Sigmar. Though you follow Ulric, I don't care what you think. In the last week, we've killed more beastmen than you and your men could dream of taking down.\"\n\"We received reports from the local priest. He says that the presence of beastmen in this area has increased since you arrived. So I suppose you're doing quite poorly,\" replied the Ulrican.\n\"Come with me and shut your mouth. Then tell me why you're here.\" I turned my back on him with disinterest, guiding him to the front of the camp.\nAnd that's when the hundreds of beastmen corpses piled up at the gates were first seen.\n\"I suppose you know what this is… right, Ulrican? A minotaur,\" I said as I grabbed one of the dead beasts by the horn. Its body had been pierced by dozens of bullets, its eyes still wide open, its tongue hanging out, and its enormous head tilted as if it were still trying to breathe. I exerted enough force to lift its head for a few seconds, showing it to him.\n\"An abomination...\" murmured the Ulrican as his eyes scanned the entire field full of beastmen corpses.\n\"That's right, Ulrican. The Cult of Sigmar sent its best beastmen hunter in Reikland, and I won't rest until these woods are free of the corrupt presence of mutants... or until the time the cult deems necessary for this campaign comes to an end. And what are you going to do?\"\nThe musket shots began to resonate again. Another group of beastmen had emerged from the forest, charging en masse toward our positions. The musketeers tore them apart before they could even get close.\n\"Are you going to waste my time, or are you going to tell me why you're here?\" I asked, not taking my eyes off the front while my men cut down everything emerging from the trees.\n\"We received orders from the Ar-Ulric to help the Sigmarites in their mission in the Drakwald… So I assume you're that Sigmarite. More of my brothers will be arriving soon. Our mission is to destroy some of the war herds inhabiting the nearby woods, to relieve the pressure on the local populations,\" said the Ulrican leader in a less confrontational tone.\n\"How many of you are there?\" I asked, turning my head slightly without taking my eyes off the continuous musket fire.\n\"Three hundred. And more should arrive soon, Sigmarite. It was an order for most of the White Wolf knights. We all came to help,\" said the Ulrican.\n\"Great. You could be useful to me… as long as it doesn't bother you to wait. I'm waiting for this to stop happening. Because if I had gone into the forest with my men directly, I'd probably be sending hundreds to Morr's gardens.\" I turned around and began walking toward the rear of the camp.\n\"Enter. This is going to take a while,\" I said to the knights.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Let your fury drive us, let your will strengthen us. Let our will be yours and let your enemies tremble before our might. For Ulric, victory will be ours!\" prayed some of the knights and with some of my Ulrican men before what seemed to be a great battle approaching.\n\"Sigmar, Lord of War, may your hammer fall upon our enemies with the strength of your justice. May the power of your warriors be reflected in our deeds. With your strength, we will prevail. For the Empire and for Sigmar,\" the same was happening on the other side of the camp with the Sigmarites.\nOutside our camp, which had already become a true wooden fortress among the felled trees, with additional buildings to improve the lines of fire, the situation had become increasingly intense.\nOver the last few months, we had performed miracles to clear the woods. However, these lands were plagued with abominations. It was a level of infestation we hadn't expected. We had destroyed three war herds of beastmen that had directly clashed against our defenses, but they acted as mere walls of flesh. They tried to reach our lines while the Ulricans and our pikemen held them back, filling the outside of the camp with bodies.\nBut everything changed when we began purifying the monoliths the beastmen worshiped. With the help of the Ulrican priests, we destroyed altars and killed young ones and breeders hidden in caves. That audacity attracted entire herds. And every day that passed, there were more.\nMany nobles from Altdorf began arriving with their entourages. They thought this would be another one of those glorified hunts like the ones organized by the Margrave. But he was busy in Bretonnia, having recently conquered the Duchy of Parravon, although they suffered a crushing defeat when they tried to take Gisoreux. Unable to organize their famous campaigns, the nobles came to ours.\nWith them came artisans, bards, scribes, and additional troops. For a while, it was useful. More swords, more hands, more weapons. But also more noise, more movement... and more attention from the beastmen. The more we dared to destroy their sanctuaries, the more they responded. There were days when we ran out of gunpowder without realizing it and had to go back to using black powder. Truly desperate moments, where thousands of beastmen attacked at the same time, led by wargors and enraged minotaurs.\nAnd yet... the last few days had been silent.The source of this content ɪs NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nNot a silence of peace, but the one that precedes a storm.\nWhen I move away from the camp, I can feel it. There are corrupt signs in the air, metal pieces infected by ruinous energy, and a gigantic group of beastmen that has gathered deep in the forest. I've gone out several nights alone, killing in the dark, strangling them with their own iron collars, searching for a particular creature. One that smells like excrement and rot, and that carries a staff that makes my skin crawl every time I get close. I've killed several of those repulsive shamans, but it's not enough. Not with the magnitude of what's coming.\nAnd the worst... many nobles, upon learning what we were truly facing, packed their things and fled. With them went their servants, soldiers, and entire retinues, leaving us almost alone to face what promises to be one of the toughest battles of our lives.\nNow, we can only count on the Ulricans and the local lords who have joined us in the face of danger. The rest... has already chosen its path.\nThis is how an army of almost 14,000 men was formed, occupying the fortification with several defensive layers that we have extended, which will now be used against who knows how many beastmen will launch at us at any moment.\nFortunately, I was well-stocked with gunpowder and lead ammunition. The muskets would not stop firing, and with over three thousand musketeers in line, at least we could ensure thousands of casualties before they reached us.\nI felt a huge amount of energy beginning to concentrate ahead. It was dense, corrupt, unnatural. There was no doubt: it was Dhar. Some dark sorcerer was preparing to unleash his magic in front of us.\n\"Captain, are you prepared?\" I said, looking at the leader of the Ulrican knights who were with us.\n\"Victory will be ours... FOR ULRIC!\" the captain roared, with a fanatical conviction that contrasted with the visible fear on many other faces.\n\"Whatever happens, it's been a pleasure,\" I said, staring at the forest, feeling how the metal fragments began to vibrate slightly around me.\n\"Same here. It's been an honor fighting by your side... even if you're a Sigmarite,\" replied the captain, drawing his sword and moving to prepare to defend the main entrance.\nFortunately, there were no more Ulrican priests in the camp. They had left recently to fulfill their religious duties. This gave me the freedom to use my magic if necessary, and seeing what was coming, it surely would.\n\"They're coming... Let's go, children of the Empire! Don't let your hands tremble! Today we fight not just for glory or for honor. We fight for the Empire of our lord, the first Emperor. We may fall today... but if so, we will do it fighting, with a curse on our lips. And they will bleed for every step they take! They will pay with rivers of their corrupt blood for trying to take our heads!\" I shouted forcefully, addressing all those present.\n\"FOR SIGMAR AND THE EMPIRE!\" my men shouted, with their muskets raised.\n\"FOR ULRIC AND THE EMPIRE!\" responded the Ulricans, raising their swords.\nThen they began to emerge. Dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of beastmen emerged from the forest, almost a kilometer ahead of the camp. Thanks to our previous efforts, we had cleared that distance to improve the line of fire. But even that didn't stop them: they ran like rabid animals, growling, howling, and screeching as they charged toward us.\nThe first shots sounded like thunder. Dozens. Then hundreds. Then thousands. A symphony of mechanical death rumbled across the field, mixed with the groans of pain from the beastmen who fell by the dozens.\nAnd still, they didn't stop coming.\nOur men reloaded quickly, using powder bags and bullets that we had stored by the thousands.\nSeveral more waves were needed before even one of them reached the first defensive trench. Many fell before, but when they reached the stakes hidden in the ground, dozens were impaled immediately. The trench, deep and wide, quickly began to fill with bodies, piling up on top of each other until their comrades could walk over them.\nIt didn't matter how many died. More and more kept coming. When the trenches collapsed under the weight of the corpses, better-armed beastmen started to appear. Some wore pieces of looted Imperial armor, which made them more dangerous... but also more vulnerable.\nThat's when I decided to act.\nAs I watched the battlefield, I felt the winds of Chamon gathering around me. The amount of steel, lead, and iron in the area was such that I could mold the field at will. I manipulated the magic\ncrushing the ribs of every beastman wearing armor. I made their breastplates compress brutally, crushing their organs. Or I forced the metals to bend and pierce their hearts like blades.\nIn the chaos, those bodies simply collapsed. Many didn't even understand how they died. No one had touched them, nor had they been shot. Yet they fell, one by one, with broken ribcages or metal fragments embedded in their chests.\nEven so, the beastmen reached the second trench, and the same process began: their bodies quickly filled it as they tried to desperately jump over the great trench separating us from them. The few who managed to pass were immediately struck down by the musketeers' fire.\nBut the tide seemed endless. Even with thousands of corpses already scattered across the field since the massacre began, I could feel new hordes of beastmen approaching, like a wave that wouldn't stop until it drowned us.\nAfter almost half an hour of slaughter, the trenches were covered with bodies to the point that the enemies could cross them by stepping on the corpses of their own comrades. The second line of defense was breached, and the beastmen began to fiercely strike the great door defended by the Ulricans.\nThe musketeers, from the towers flanking the door, had the perfect shot to fire at the beasts trying to destroy the wood with their machetes and clubs. They fell by the dozens, but there were always more behind, pushing fearlessly.\nThe door began to give. Although I secretly used my magic to wear down the edges of their weapons, the pure brute force was enough to break the reinforced planks. Finally, after several almost fanatical assaults, the beastmen managed to open a gap large enough to attempt entry.\n\"For Ulric!\" the Ulrican knights shouted, immediately charging at the beasts entering through the door. Their maces and swords cut through flesh, crushing skulls, and repelling the first invaders, while a new rain of lead fell from the towers upon the stragglers.\nThe battle became chaotic. The beastmen began to infiltrate the first perimeter of the camp, forcing my pikemen to engage in combat to reinforce the Ulricans, who were already suffering casualties from the unrelenting tide.\nAt that moment, I felt a different disturbance. A putrid stench mixed with the air, and a corrupt aura filtered through the ranks of the beasts. Several wargors emerged, all with armor marked with the symbol of Khorne. My attempts to manipulate their steel were useless. Unlike the junk armor of the common gors, these armors seemed reinforced with Chaos magic. With great effort, I managed to make one's breastplate close over its ribs, crushing its chest, but there were many more. And with them came several minotaurs.\nWhen those monsters reached the door, they destroyed it with a single blow. The gap that had barely allowed a few beastmen to pass was now large enough to allow the entrance of those gigantic beasts, who crashed through like an avalanche of flesh and horns.\nThe minotaurs crushed the Ulricans with each charge, smashing shields, skulls, and bones. The scene turned into a slaughter. Only the almost suicidal courage of the White Wolf knights and the discipline of the Imperial pikemen managed to stop, at a very high cost, those creatures.\nMeanwhile, the wargors fought with an enormous ferocity, pushing our lines while being shot by the musketeers from the rear.\nFinally, when it seemed that we were starting to regain control, an even darker sensation spread through the air. Among the last waves, a monstrosity appeared. A gigantic beastman, with four arms, lifting a rock the size of a war wagon.\n\"WATCH OUT ON THE WALLS!\" I shouted.\nThe rock flew through the air like a catapult projectile, crashing into one section of the wall. The wood splintered, several musketeers were dragged with the impact, and some Ulricans were crushed under the debris.\n\"ALL FIRE AGAINST THAT!\" I commanded with all the voice I could muster.\nI immediately felt the dark magic. That creature was protected by spells. I located the beastman shaman hiding among the rear ranks, waving his staff like a madman.\nI stopped secretly reinforcing the weapons and armor of my men. All my focus turned to the shaman. I manipulated the iron surrounding him from the weapons of his fallen comrades and impaled him with multiple metal spears, piercing him like an insect. I melted the metal from within, causing him indescribable agony while his staff fell from his grasp.\nThe magic protecting the giant beastman dissipated. Confused, it began devouring the bodies of its fallen comrades, tearing limbs off and swallowing them whole in a cannibalistic frenzy.\n\"IGNORE THAT THING! FINISH OFF ALL THE BEASTMEN WHO'VE ENTERED THE CAMP!\" I ordered.\nThe musketeers turned their weapons and, one by one, began executing the remaining enemies. When the silence finally fell over the camp, we all looked toward the exterior monstrosity, which continued devouring without stopping.\nWe stood still, watching as it swallowed flesh and bone, until, suddenly, it began to run toward the forest, chasing other beastmen who were fleeing in terror.\nThe air stood still. We breathed, exhausted, among the corpses.\n\"For next year… I'm bringing cannons,\" I murmured to myself.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It was a costly victory, but a victory nonetheless. The beastmen were defeated, despite the heavy losses we suffered, mainly due to the large number of minotaurs and wargors gathered. Several packs had united to eliminate us, and they ended up being annihilated against our fortifications.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nAs soon as the gigantic beastman left the area, we ventured into the woods to locate where they had gathered. We didn't destroy the herdstone —not yet— but we did enter the main cave. Inside, we found thousands of female beastmen, as well as human women corrupted by Chaos. Some seemed to retain their sanity. But not even the Ulrican priests were willing to take the risk. They opted for the more fanatical path: purge everything before the rot spread.\nMost of these creatures were pregnant. We had stopped the birth of a new generation of horrors that, if they had grown, would once again ravage the roads and villages. But still, I had made a mistake. I had completely underestimated the total number of these beasts. I thought it would be like in Reikland, where the forests are populated by thousands, not hundreds of thousands, or even millions.\nHere, even in a small section of the Drakwald, the density of beasts was terrifying. We tried to maintain a daily estimate, as several local nobles offered rewards for each head delivered. But it was impossible to keep an accurate count. We killed so many each day that mountains of corpses were formed, and we couldn't even count them. We ended up burning them with oil and wood because leaving the bodies there only benefited the scavengers... or the beastmen themselves.\nThe Ulricans suffered the most. They insisted on leading the vanguard, and I didn't oppose it. If they wanted to bear the losses, I would just provide the gunpowder and weapons to keep the enemy at bay. With nearly two thousand dead —most of them Ulricans— we had exterminated a concentration of beasts large enough to guarantee years of relative safety in the region... until another pack tries to fill the void.\nThe local lords were euphoric. Their roads and nearby forests were once again passable. They could cut trees, hunt, expand... though with the ever-present risk that the hunters would become prey. But for now, the villages near Carroburg could breathe with some peace, at least for a few months.\nWith the Ulrican priests, we decided not to purify another herdstone. Without my firearms, they would hardly be able to stop another wave like the one we faced last week. I recommended they keep watch, observe the signs, and regroup if more signs of activity appeared. But, in reality, I needed to return to my lands. The harvest season had already passed, and I found myself trapped here because of the appearance of that gigantic beastman pack. If I abandoned the Ulricans now, it wouldn't be any different from what the nobles of Altdorf did when they fled like cowards. And all this campaign, which was supposed to strengthen ties between them and the Sigmarites, would only have served to reinforce their distrust of us by leaving them alone... just like when everyone fled back to the capital.\nSo, I gathered my men, loaded the bodies of our dead, and began the journey back to Reinsfeld. I also sent a messenger to the Cult of Sigmar, with an estimate of how many we had killed, so they could take it into account. On average, we were eliminating four thousand beastmen daily across all forces; that, multiplied by three months of hostilities, represents real damage. But honestly, I think the most important blow was the slaughter of the breeders. Without offspring, there's no war.\nWe passed through Carroburg, where we received a small reward from the local duke. He only paid for exact and confirmed numbers, so he compensated us for a few thousand beastmen... nothing compared to the actual number. No one is going to pay a reward for more than a quarter of a million beasts. That would leave any noble in debt for generations.\nAfter that, we descended into Schilderheim, formed ranks, and marched directly to my city. By then, the tax collection should have been starting. We moved along the pacified roads of Reinsfeld without delays, delivered the bodies to the Temple of Morr, and distributed the corresponding portion of the rewards among the soldiers, so they could send their shares to the families of the fallen. With these last ones, there were almost five hundred men who had died under my command since I started taking the war outside of my lands.\nAt least, things had returned to normal. The deadline I had granted to the archlector of Reinsfeld had ended, and with it, the grace period for the witch hunters expired. They tried to impose their fanatical criteria again, but this time they ran into a wall. Those who decided to ignore the limit were severely punished by the Cult of Sigmar itself. This is what happens when the Cult prefers to protect a lord who finances temples, schools, and preachers, rather than lose political influence because of their own fanatics.\nAs soon as I returned, I had to face the heaviest part of the work: the paperwork. Reviewing how much I had collected from the harvests this year… although I didn't really plan to sell food this time. I still had to feed a bunch of Bretonians who were still working on my lands. I had to reorganize the tax reports, add the new citizens to the files, prepare them for the next tax cycle, check what had been paid by merchants and artisans, and calculate how much would actually go into my coffers.\nMonthly, I had to pay 71,500 crowns to keep my militias and personal army standing, all well-paid and loyal. Additionally, there were another 2,750 crowns in pensions for the families of the fallen. It was a huge expense compared to my initial income, but between the sale of dyes, books, and soaps, I was generating around 120,000 crowns per month. Still, with my workers and the large construction team, I was still in the red, covering the deficits with the Bretonian treasury. I wasn't worried. Even if it took a few years to empty completely, eventually the income from the gunpowder would cover all the expenses. And then, only then, could I relax and enjoy the sweet fruits of hard work.\nSo I let my men rest for a while while I checked on how Merxheim was progressing during my short absence due to the hunt.\n\"So, how's everything going, Otto?\" I said while riding, followed by a large escort.\n\"Good… good… too good, actually. But considering we have more than eight thousand workers, it's to be expected,\" Otto replied as we moved on horseback.\n\"Give me the general report. I still have to go over the tax paperwork, and I've been putting it off because it's too much work,\" I responded.\n\"Yes, uh… a lot of work…\" Otto replied with a doubtful tone.\n\"Hey… what's that?\" I asked, pointing to a structure near the river.\n\"Ah… that. It's a water-powered mill. Considering that the population of Reinsfeld and its farmlands have multiplied several times, I figured that your only mill wouldn't be enough. So, before you asked me in a hurry, I commissioned water mills from a craftsman in Altdorf and brought them here to install. That mill should be able to process about twenty or thirty times more grain than yours,\" Otto said with pride.\n\"Wow… you've done something wonderful. But was this approved in the budget, or did you just assume I'd pay for it?\" I asked the architect.\n\"What do you think? Am I going to pay for buildings for you with my personal wealth? Never. Clearly, you paid for it. And don't tell me it's not useful, or you wouldn't be expanding the farmland so aggressively with Bretonian labor… because those guys work as if their lives depended on it,\" Otto responded.\n\"Alright… a good investment, I suppose. How's my new city going?\" I asked, smiling at him.\n\"Well, obviously we didn't reach the goal of housing all the families, but we've worked as hard as we could,\" Otto said.\n\"That's not what I asked, Otto,\" I said, looking at him intently.\n\"Currently, the city can house around thirty thousand people properly. Clearly, they'll have to be crowded for a couple of months while we continue building. We still have a month and a half before the snow falls, so we can finish many more houses. The work is fast, but the sheer number of people we need to house is too much… especially because we fell behind a bit on the city's sewer system, the port, and the market,\" Otto explained.\nWe finally arrived at Merxheim, and I could see everything was built as it should. The houses were spaced perfectly, all the old buildings had been demolished and replaced from scratch. Where there was once just a small stretch of sand by the river, now there was a large river port with ships already docked unloading goods. As I entered the city, I observed the enormous amounts of houses being built simultaneously, with workers from several imperial architects building tirelessly, racing against time.\nAnd at the same time, there was a lot of activity in the town market. I could easily see dozens of merchants working or setting up their stalls. Some merchants who clearly worked for Rutger were also present, selling my products in the market.\n\"At the moment, the whole city is almost empty, only the two thousand inhabitants who lived in the city live here, but many artisans make the trip from Reinsfeld to sell products,\" said Otto.\n\"I see... either way, I need to make sure that, if necessary, all the Bretonians can be housed,\" I responded, moving on horseback toward the fields that had been set up in record time.\nThe Bretonian peasants had done an impressive job here, probably under Otto's guidance, but all the fields had irrigation channels and were perfectly ready for the next year. Though many of the Bretonian serfs were still working the fields, finishing the threshing of what they had harvested.\nGiven the short time available for planting and harvesting, it seems they planted barley. It didn't have much value on the market, as it was food for the lower classes, unlike wheat, which was food for the armies and the upper classes. Therefore, even though they managed to plant something, it wouldn't have much commercial value, but it would serve to make flour and feed the Bretonians themselves.\nI immediately noticed that the Bretonians looked much healthier. They had gained weight; they no longer looked skeletal, but some still showed signs of the toll of the lack of food as they slowly recovered from their long life of exhausting work.\nWhen they saw me, all the serfs stopped and quickly came towards me, bowing their heads.\n\"You've done a good job, and from what I see, a great harvest?\" I said in Bretonian, looking at them.\n\"Thank you, milord,\" one of them responded in Reikspiel.\n\"Oh... well... what a pleasant surprise,\" I replied in Reikspiel to the serf who had answered me.\n\"Ah... the... the priest... Sigmar... milord... teaches us Reikspiel...\" the serf replied, this time more hesitantly.\n\"I see... I'm glad you're trying to adapt. Well, when you're done with that, take it to the mill and keep two sacks of barley flour each,\" I said in Bretonian.\n\"Thank you, milord,\" they almost all replied in Reikspiel.\nI began to move away to inspect more fields, where Bretonians were working tirelessly, harvesting barley, and deeply grateful.\nI was seriously considering going to Bretonnia to kidnap more.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

They were going to accompany us. There were no more than ninety of them, but dawi are very dangerous warriors.\nWhile I was busy bathing in beastmen blood, the dawi had arrived from other fortresses, minor clans that barely made it into the respectable category, since of the several clans that came to settle in the karak, only three had a runic smith. Of nearly eighty minor clans that arrived at this karak, they added up to around a thousand dawi, doubling the population of Durin's clan.\nThey had been preparing for our arrival, trying to gather as much runic weaponry as possible to follow us into battle. Not only to receive human help in recovering their fortresses, but because many clans were attracted by the idea that, in the past, Durin's clan's karak mined gromril, a very valuable dawi metal for making armor and powerful runes. So many clans had already arrived for that reason and, for the moment, were helping to rebuild the karak, expanding parts of the fortifications and digging over the mountain. It was time to see if it was possible to recover another fortress, and with some luck, one that had gromril. As a friend of the clan, I might get an armor and one of those valuable veins just for helping... but first, we had to find it, if there was anything left.\n\"Durin, everything good for our march?\" I asked the dawi who had put on his full runic armor and was grabbing his axe and shield, ready to accompany us.\n\"Yes, dawongi, everything's ready for us to march. I would've liked to help with more men, but my clan doesn't have many warriors, and the minor clans that joined us are mostly miners, not warriors. We'll do everything we can to help,\" said Durin, raising his axe.\n\"Then let's go now. I've got everything on my end... we have enough lead for each of my musketeers to have a hundred shots, enough powder to spend liberally, and supplies for two months of campaigning. God willing, that won't be the case,\" I said with a smile.\n\"We've got our stuff ready, dawongi. Let's go,\" said Durin.\nWith that, we began to venture into the depths of the great road that connected Durin's clan's karak with tunnels dug by ancient generations of dawi. They were filled with crystals that emitted a faint natural light, allowing us to proceed without the need for torches.\nThus began the march of five thousand humans and the dawi contingent, following the tunnels.\nAlong the way, we found all kinds of statues, but the paths were empty. Occasionally, we came across what seemed to be small dawi storerooms, completely empty of anything valuable that they may have once contained. Still, we kept moving forward without issues, discovering more and more of the long tunnel. The tunnels were enormous… only the gods know how the dawi took the time to dig these, especially since they decorated the walls where they mined. Even using my magic to try to detect something, I only felt the tunnel stretching beyond the limits of my sensitivity within the mines.\nAfter what felt like an eternity of marching, we finally reached a fork.\n\"Considering where we entered... that tunnel leads toward Helmgart... and the other toward Marienburg. Durin, do you know anything about where the next karak of your clan might be?\" I asked the dawi.\n\"According to the little information I have left from my clan, there was a karak toward Helmgart that was used as a commercial outlet toward the umgi lands of the Empire and the Bretonians. Toward Marienburg, there were most of my clan's old karaks,\" Durin replied.\n\"In Bretonnian territory, there are gold mines... I don't know if you're interested in checking if there's a gold mining area near the karak of Helmgart,\" I asked.\n\"It's a possibility… but it would be better to try upward. There we might find something more important, like lost information from my clan,\" said Durin.\n\"Alright, then let's keep going,\" I said, and we began walking again, this time eastward, toward the Wastelands.\nAfter another long stretch of walking, I finally began to feel something. The closer we got, the clearer the shape became in front of me: a large dawi fortress. I could also feel hidden voids between the walls—clearly dawi secret chambers—but what stood out the most was the immense amount of iron and steel fragments trapped in the stone, as if the walls themselves were filled with metal.\nWe continued until we reached the karak. The gates were shattered, collapsed on the ground. We quickly entered in a tight formation, with pikes at the ready and shields up. As we advanced, we found huge piles of waste, trash accumulated in all corners of the fortress. The air was filled with the smell of rot, excrement, and dried blood.\nAnd then we heard it.\n\"WAAAAAAAAGH,\" a voice roared from inside the karak.\n\"WAAAAAAAAGH,\" more voices repeated, louder, closer. The metallic echo of weapons clashing began to rumble through the tunnels. I could feel it: axes, maces, hammers... clashing against each other. It didn't take long for us to realize what was happening.\nIn a large hall, orks were in the midst of a chaotic battle between themselves. They hadn't noticed us. They were killing each other, laughing, hitting, tearing apart. They were completely absorbed in their own frenzy.\nWe remained completely silent.\nAs long as they kept killing each other, the better. The fewer left standing, the easier it would be to eliminate them and take control of the karak. So we waited. My men kept their pikes forward, standing firm, not moving a step while the orks continued to charge at each other with a brutality that seemed endless. More and more green skins arrived, shouting, rushing into the fight with no order, no discipline. It was total madness.\nIt felt like an eternity.\nMy soldiers even held their breath to avoid being detected. Finally, the screams began to subside. The sound of combat gradually faded. The clamor of metal diminished. I could tell that there were few left holding weapons; many were wounded, gasping, covered in the blood of their own comrades.\nThen, we stepped forward.\nWe made noise deliberately.\nThe orks raised their heads when they heard us. A few peered out of the tunnel and, upon seeing us, let out a war cry and charged with wide grins, convinced it would be a good fight. But all they found was a deafening volley.\nDozens of musket shots pierced them before they could even reach the line of combat. They fell one after the other, riddled with bullets, while they continued entering willingly into our perfect kill zone. The line held firm. And the ground began to fill with green corpses.\nWith enough musketeers to maintain a constant rotation, we managed to contain and eliminate most of the greenskins. Once they stopped coming, we advanced into the main hall of the karak. It was enormous, completely covered with ork bodies, piled one on top of the other to the ceiling.\nFrom there, a deep cleaning began. Many of the remaining greenskins had scattered and hidden in far-off areas of the karak when they realized we were too many for them and they had no way of stopping us.\nThe dawi took the lead, guiding small groups of musketeers through the corridors. They went from room to room, eliminating any orks still hiding. It wasn't a quick operation, but it was meticulous. By the time we finished, the karak was completely secured. It wasn't a difficult fight; the dawi had done most of the work. We only had to sweep up the remains.\nWith much effort, we began to move the bodies into a large room where, based on the way the air circulated, the ancient forge of the fortress must have been. We took advantage of the ventilation there to burn the orks and prevent their bodies from releasing spores.\n\"Such stupid Thagoraki… But that's what makes them so dangerous: their stupidity makes them incapable of feeling fear,\" said Duran, watching the piles of burning bodies.\n\"This is a great stroke of luck for us. We recovered a karak by killing only a few dozen Thagoraki… Not like the other one, where I had to eliminate thousands of goblins and those damn giant spiders. Those things were truly horrible,\" I said, looking at the blackened remains.\n\"We still have to check more levels, dawongi. Only the ancestors know what awaits us below… and then we need to search if my ancestors left us something worthy to continue with the glorious rebirth of our lineage,\" said Duran in a solemn voice.\n\"Sure,\" I replied without mentioning that I didn't feel any movement beyond us. I was completely sure that there was no one left alive inside the karak.\nSo we continued the exploration.\nWe descended through the multiple levels of the dawi fortress. We found the cemeteries of clan members who were not of the thane's direct lineage; they were completely looted. Further down, we discovered the ancient mushroom farms, though from Duran's reaction, they didn't seem to be the mushrooms the dawi usually cultivated: they were probably greenskin mushrooms.\nThe armories were empty. The stores were filled with garbage and junk. We passed by rooms with broken statues, others with destroyed dwarf carvings, and finally reached the room of the former lord of the karak… completely torn apart.\nWe kept searching.\nThat's when I noticed something strange: a room with no minerals around it. The rock was different, more uniform, as if intentionally crafted. I knew right away. It was a secret dawi chamber.\n\"Duran… look what I found,\" I said while placing my hand on an ancient rune.\nThe stone glowed upon contact. The rune reacted to my touch, and slowly, the wall began to open.\nDuran came running with some of his warriors at the commotion, and they were fascinated to know that there were areas that the greenskins hadn't been able to loot. As we descended, we found tombs, similar to those in the first karak, but this room was much larger, with multiple tombs, and I noticed there were books on shelves.\nDuran began laughing like a little child and started reading with great speed.\n\"Does it say something interesting? I see you're so absorbed in those books,\" I asked the dawi who hadn't stopped reading since we arrived.\n\"Ah dawongi… these books contain information about my lineage… many of the arts of stoneworking and blacksmithing are here…\" said the dawi, trying to prevent me from reading.\n\"Bah, don't worry, Duran. I can't read Khazalid,\" I said, raising my hands.\n\"Ah… of course, good point,\" said the dawi.\nDuran kept reading for what seemed like an eternity until he began to yawn repeatedly. With no signs of the sun or moon, it was hard to tell if it was bedtime or not.\nFinally, the dawi closed the books.\n\"Let's go, dawongi. I think I know where my clan's gromril mines are,\" said Duran.\nWe went back down to the lower levels of the dawi fortress to an area with a long corridor where Duran placed his hand and another secret door opened.\nIt revealed a tunnel that went directly downward. We descended the tunnel, going down carved stone steps until we reached what appeared to be a mine.\nDuran began running his hand over a kind of mineral slowly.\n\"Gromril,\" said Duran, passing his hand over the mineral, too happy.\nI began to sense the gromril vein… and it was small… very small… there was almost nothing left… now, how do I explain to the dawi that barely any gromril remained from his ancestors?\nExpanding my senses a little more and recognizing the signal from the mineral, I noticed that there were other areas with the same mineral.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Losing hours of sleep didn't bother me; I was focused on charting a map of the nearby mineral veins. Such a thing would earn us the favour of our dwarf allies and, with luck, attract more of them. Costly labour, yes, but competent—perfect for work where quality mattered above all, no matter the expense.\nUnderground, it was impossible to tell the hour without a damned clock, and the lack of any reference gnawed at me. Pleasant as it was to feel the Winds of Chamon flowing through the minerals around us, the disorientation caused by the absence of light was maddening.\nI was leaning over the parchment, marking the most promising veins with a piece of charcoal, when something caught my attention. A metallic sound. A rhythmic clinking, like mail cinched tight at the waist, accompanied by the soft tapping of daggers knocking against their sheaths.\n\"Too slender for a dawi… too small for a greenskin,\" I thought, noticing that the pieces of metal were moving quickly. Whoever carried them ran as though fire burned in its gut.\nI tracked the presence for minutes, feeling it draw nearer. Then, from the shadows, two sickly red eyes fixed on me. In less than a heartbeat, a metallic projectile shot toward my chest, bouncing off the steel plate of my breastplate. The figure did not stop—it leapt with unnatural agility, both daggers aimed at my neck.\nI managed to draw my sword just in time. When it tried to cut me, its dagger dissolved into a viscous, grey mass before it could touch my flesh; the metal liquefied under my control, sliding down its hand and clinging to the fur. The skaven snarled in confusion and tried to stab at my face with the other hand, but the same thing happened—the blade melted into metallic sludge that dripped onto my cuirass.\nIt didn't relent. From its tail, it launched a third strike—a curved dagger aimed at my flank. The blade dissolved like the others. That was my moment. I seized its leg and dragged it to the ground.\nIt was fast, twisting and kicking with claws and hind legs to break free. It rolled over to escape, but I was already upon it. I gripped its neck with both hands, quickly shifting my hold to its head, and drove my thumbs into its eyes.\nThe scream it released was high and piercing, echoing through the tunnel walls. I felt the elastic resistance of the eyeballs before they gave way under the pressure. A hot spray soaked my gauntlets. The skaven kicked and clawed at the ground, trying to tear me off, but I did not let go until its screams turned into a desperate gurgle.\nI shoved it down, blind and convulsing, claws flailing for me. Without giving it a chance to recover, I raised my sword and brought it down hard. The blade bit through its neck with a wet crack; the head rolled a few steps before lying still. The body kept twitching for a few seconds, shaking like a freshly slaughtered beast, until it finally lay still, bleeding onto the stone.\nThe stench of skaven blood hit my nose, filling me with disgust for the filth that had attacked me. Looking closer, now calmer after the sudden strike, I realised it was likely one of their assassins—Probably a servant of some member of the Council of Thirteen. That meant there had to be a skaven settlement nearby, and that was far from good news.\nWhile I considered this, some dawi came looking for me, drawn by the painful shrieks the skaven had let out before dying as it deserved.\n\"Umgi,\" said one of the dawi from Duran's allied clans. \"…a raki,\" the dwarf added, looking at me.\n\"I'm fine, you don't need to worry. Sleep well, dawi—seems like it was the only one,\" I replied, kicking the skaven's head.\n\"Where there's one raki, there are always more. A hundred or a thousand… umgi, these are dangerous foes for their numbers,\" said the dwarf.\n\"Understood. It came from that tunnel, so I assume there may be more that way.\"\nThe dawi nodded and returned to the karak. In the end, some guards relieved me from watch, though that didn't stop me from handing the map to Duran, passing it off as a skaven tunnel chart to avoid revealing my magical affinity.\n\"So, a raki attacked you on watch? Cowardly vermin, striking at my dawongi…,\" Duran said as he examined the parchment. \"But it does look like a map made by those raki. Look at how awful the lines are—you can tell they can't even draw, the plagues that scourge the dawi.\"\n\"Yes… they don't seem that bad to me,\" I said, pressing my lips together as Duran mocked my sketches.\n\"Are you jesting, dawongi? Look at this mess—it's nothing but lines without pattern. Only the one who made it could understand it,\" Duran said, laughing at the drawings.\n\"I see,\" I answered with a false smile.\n\"But if the raki have tunnels here, we should inspect them. There might be valuable resources they're trying to exploit. And at the same time, we can block their movement routes so they can't overwhelm us with numbers, especially in a karak that's half-collapsed,\" Duran said, taking up his shield and axe to begin another day of fighting.\nSo, leaving a garrison of dawi and my men to start repairing the karak, we followed the path taken by the skaven assassin that had tried to end my life. My men asked why there were \"beasts\" underground… apparently, no one knew what a skaven was, mistaking it for a beastman.\nOnce again, the crystals lighting the way came into view, along with the dwarfen statues that changed design often. But that was all—just a long tunnel stretching straight into who knew where, until we found some smaller shafts that had clearly been mined by a race other than the dawi, judging by the clumsy, unsteady manner of their excavation.\n\"If the raki's map was correct, it marked something here,\" said Duran, stepping into the hole.\nI stayed outside, avoiding any comment about the tunnel being too small for me—no need to offend the dawi. I waited until Duran and his men emerged again.\n\"Silver. Looks like there's a promising vein in there, so we'll have work ahead of us extracting it,\" Duran said.\nWe kept inspecting many of those tunnels, likely dug by goblins, finding copper, iron, and large quantities of coal. But what truly set the dawi alight with joy was a medium-sized vein of gromril. Their shouts of excitement echoed through the passage, and it wasn't hard to guess they were thanking their ancestors for such a find.\nThe path continued for quite a distance until it opened into a vast intersection. There, an old karak stood at the centre, splitting the route into four directions—one toward the Empire, another to Bretonnia, a third toward Marienburg, and the last descending further into the depths.\nUpon entering, we found it completely empty. Yet there were signs that something had settled there long ago. It was impossible to tell what, as only small bones remained, shattered or ground to dust; there was no trace of flesh nor any clear indication of their origin.\n\"Four paths… and still no sign of my clan's main karak,\" Duran said, his voice heavy with frustration.\n\"I think we can still investigate further. We could establish an outpost here and explore the other paths,\" I suggested, studying the terrain.\n\"We can't be that aggressive, dawongi… I have barely ninety warriors. I cannot defend three karaks at once without risking the thagoraki endangering my family and allies. Pushing forward would be an unnecessary risk. We must fall back to our new find and wait. I can't ask your umgi to stay here guarding our karaks—umgi aren't made for life beneath the mountains. I'll settle for the previous karak, and wait for the gromril to draw in other clans or clanless dwarfs looking to join. With silver and gromril, few will be able to resist,\" Duran said, pressing his lips together.\nI understood. We retraced our steps, returning by the same path we had taken in, reaching the newly discovered karak in short order. I would have liked the campaign to last longer, but the mountains seemed relatively quiet.\nMost of Duran's warriors stayed in the new karak, while we set off toward the one at the exit near my mining town. After a long walk that wore down the legs, we arrived at the dwarf stronghold, where Duran announced what we had found.\nThe reaction was immediate: several minor clans, numbering around three hundred dawi, gathered their belongings and departed at once for the new karak to begin its reconstruction and restart mining operations for the coveted dwarf metal. The dawi were elated; another stronghold had been reclaimed, and the runesmiths were already debating what they would forge first with the gromril, speaking of inscribing it with the most powerful runes they knew.\nBut Duran looked troubled, and for an obvious reason. He had within reach the chance to reclaim more of his ancestors' glory, yet danger lingered. If I were away on campaign and the karak were attacked, it could all be lost in a single night. No one knows when an enemy will strike.\n\"Come now, my friend, don't look so grim… sooner or later we'll reclaim all your clan's holdings. It's only a matter of time. We must be patient, and eventually you'll have thousands of dawi in your lands, fighting by your side. When we start selling powder to every dawi karak, the gold will flow to you, and that wealth will draw your kin to you,\" I told the pensive Duran.\n\"It's vexing… have you ever been in a situation where you want to act, but can't because you lack the means to protect it?\" Duran asked.\n\"Of course. I've had many problems like that. Look—send messengers to the dwarf karaks announcing we've found gromril. That should be enough to bring, with luck, a couple of thousand dawi from other strongholds next year. And I will always be offering work to your folk. That fortress and my laboratory may need expanding in the future,\" I said, patting his shoulder.\n\"Thank you, dawongi… it is good to have an umgi with honour nearby. Who knows what might have happened if you were like most, caring little for offending the dawi,\" said Duran.\n\"Speaking of work, Duran, I need cannons… I don't like to admit it, but I left the forests humiliated after my last hunt,\" I said, meeting his gaze.\n\"How…? You were defeated, dawongi?\" the dwarf asked, startled.\n\"No, but I underestimated my enemy. Next time, I intend to go in with everything. You can kill hundreds, thousands… but their numbers are endless. I need cannons, preferably ones that can fire canister. If I return next year, I will leave that forest strewn with beastmen corpses, and this time I mean it. So tell me the price for some kind of cannon that can fire that shot quickly, and I'll pay you at once. By Sigmar, I won't let this slight to my honour go unanswered,\" I said, looking at Duran.\n\"Ha! A grievance over not being able to kill all your foes… extreme even for the dawi… but I like it. You have my help, dawongi,\" Duran said, walking toward the dawi ale.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I was given many new cases to review and I'm almost drowning in work, so at most I'll give one or two short chapters of the ideas I've been asked for, since they were good ideas.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------\nKaldezeit 2-27,2489 IC\n\"So they're already functional?\" I asked the dawi engineer who was working in one of my greenhouses.\n\"Yes… I managed to do what you asked, though with great difficulty. But the challenge was remarkable—I had to rely on all my experience to get this greenhouse working as you described, keeping the temperature stable. And, according to this thing you brought, it's at the exact temperature you wanted…\" said the dawi engineer, pointing to a mercury thermometer inside the greenhouse.\nEven with all the snow falling outside, the temperature stayed above twenty-five degrees Celsius without any trouble. At last, I had what I wanted most: a greenhouse that could maintain a specific, stable temperature thanks to dwarf runes, with access to water through a simple handle that released flow through a copper pipe marked with an anti-corrosion rune.\n\"Pleasant, isn't it?\" I said, noting the huge contrast between the freezing air outside and the warm, steady climate within.\n\"I must admit, dawongi… I don't know how you came up with such an advanced idea for an umgi, but it's remarkable. If this helps end our excessive dependence on imported cotton, it will be worth every effort,\" said the engineer.\n\"Good… good… we're going to make a lot of gold together, my dear dawi friend. We'll go from planting once a year to planting three or four times any stable-cycle crop… we'll be swimming in gold crowns from selling food. So tell me—how much do I owe you for this? No one ever gave me the bill,\" I said, looking at the dwarf.\n\"It's all settled from what we owed you for the sale of powder, dawongi. You don't have to worry—just come by to collect the gold that rightfully belongs to you,\" the engineer replied.\n\"No. I want you to use it all. I need hundreds of these, thousands if necessary. I want the entire plain covered in greenhouses; I don't care how much I have to pay, I want the whole place filled, whether with cotton or wheat,\" I said with a smile.\n\"We're working on that… but with the payments we're getting from other karaks, the amount of gold that belongs to you, dawongi, far exceeds what we spend on labour and materials,\" answered the dawi engineer.\n\"For now, let Duran manage it, so that whenever I request something, you can collect immediately. I don't want problems with you over late payments, so I'd rather you hold onto it—and if I need it, I'll come for it. Makes the deals smoother when I want to buy something important,\" I said with a smile, already thinking about what to plant first.\n\"I think we'll start with wheat before cotton,\" I said, touching the damp, dark-brown soil.\n\"Why wheat? You have vast farmlands… why use such a valuable place for wheat?\" the dwarf engineer asked, clearly intrigued.\n\"Ah… very simple. This is the best laboratory for playing with botany: a controlled space, free of pests and plagues—the ideal place for experimentation. And there's no better way to do that than through the genetic selection of seeds. This would be better discussed in the laboratory, since I'm going to give you a general lesson on genetics and DNA… so it must be far from curious eyes,\" I told the dawi, who seemed eager to learn more from my basic knowledge of biology.\n\"Of course… let's go,\" said the dawi, clearly interested in the knowledge.\n\"That'll be another day. For now, I have to get this greenhouse up and running, so I'll teach you what I know soon enough,\" I replied to the engineer, who bit his lip upon realising he wouldn't get that knowledge immediately.\n\"I understand… I'll keep working on the second one. It shouldn't take too long; this one took more because I had to build several prototypes to achieve the effect you wanted,\" said the dawi.\n\"Good, get to it. I'm going to gather the workers to put them to use,\" I said as I stepped out of the greenhouse. The blast of cold air made me shiver. \"Oh… damn… it's freezing,\" I muttered, wrapping my arms around myself.\nStill trembling from the sudden drop in temperature, I headed to one of the multiple Bretonnian camps. Otto's solution to the overpopulation of Bretonnians who couldn't settle in Merxeim had been the construction of barracks: easy-to-heat structures with several beds for entire families. They lacked privacy and the smell wasn't pleasant, but at least they kept warm thanks to well-sealed walls and chimneys that heated the entire interior.\n\"All right, I need twenty of you for a job. It will be well paid, my serfs,\" I said to the group of Bretonnians eating their daily rations together with their families.\nMany stood up at once, eager to present themselves.\n\"Ah, excellent… more than I asked for. Listen, this will be full-time work—possibly your new profession, I hope. That's why I'll pay you well: two shillings should be enough for the type of work you'll have,\" I said, looking at the volunteers.\n\"Instead of food, will you pay us in coins, milord?\" one of the Bretonnian peasants asked.\n\"No. You'll still receive food, until I decide it's time to release you from your contract of servitude. Until you have your own home for your family and farmland, it's better you remain under my legal protection. This will simply be permanent work, and you'll be granted freedom once you have a home,\" I said calmly.\n\"Thank you very much, milord,\" the Bretonnian replied.\n\"All right, wrap up warm. It's bitterly cold outside,\" I warned as the Bretonnians donned the clothes my seamstress had made for them. There were no dyes or luxuries—thick wool inherited from my grandfather, heavy linen, or double layers of both.\nThe Bretonnians followed me, well bundled up, and we crossed the snow-covered fields toward the greenhouses.\nUpon entering, they seemed nervous about the immense difference in temperature compared to the outside, murmuring among themselves.\n\"Don't worry, this works exactly as planned. This place is designed to be far warmer than outside,\" I told them, easing their concerns.\nThey calmed down immediately.\n\"All right, the work is simple. In fact, you've done it for most of your lives. I need you to plant these wheat seeds in this soil and these pots, and take care of them,\" I said, looking at the group.\n\"Just that, milord?\" one of the Bretonnians asked, thoughtful.\n\"Yes, just that. You will tend to the seeds until they reach the stage where they produce grain. When that happens, I'll send someone to help you with the harder task—counting the grains on each head of wheat. From there, we'll begin choosing the best seeds and repeating the process as many times as necessary,\" I explained, also giving them instructions on how to control the water and what to avoid so as not to kill the plants.\nThe Bretonnians got to work straight away, tilling the soil with hoes, preparing the pots, and sowing and watering without much delay.\n\"Before I forget, from time to time you'll need to go outside and clear away any snow that builds up, to stop it from covering everything completely. The sun's rays—few as they are—must still come through, or this place will start to lose heat. So, carefully, clear away any snow that piles up,\" I told them. \"I'll pay you at the end of the month, since for now I doubt you'll have much use for it. Take care, and don't get sick from the change in temperature.\"\nThe Bretonnians took their leave, and I went straight to my laboratory. I had something in mind to increase food production even further.\nWith what I had on hand, I could make fertiliser easily. Without access to the Haber–Bosch process to produce ammonia in large quantities—or the technical knowledge to make it a reality—I had to settle for another type of fertiliser: one simple to make, mass-producible, and capable of boosting agricultural yields.\nI already had the perfect formula in mind: potassium nitrate. I literally had everything I needed to make it in large quantities. The saltpetre we already used to produce nitric acid, and the potash used in pigments, only needed to be processed and combined to produce a decent fertiliser. It wouldn't be the best, but given that the most common fertiliser in the region was manure—if one even had the money to keep animals—any chemical fertiliser I could produce would be far superior to organic ones.\nWith the help of the dawi, we began dissolving the saltpetre in hot water along with the potash. Once the mixture had cooled slightly, we filtered it through linen cloth to remove impurities, then left it to rest. When the crystals formed, we dried them completely and stored them.\nWith dawi labour, it took us only hours to produce a full tonne. The fertiliser was stored in sacks and taken directly to the greenhouse, where the Bretonnians began applying it to the soil they were preparing.\nRutger would now have to bring in more saltpetre than before, as it was essential for the fertiliser. Although, if I wasn't mistaken, the fertiliser I was producing wasn't ideal for outdoor use—since it dissolved so easily, a single rainfall could wash it away entirely. But inside the greenhouses, that wouldn't be a problem.\nWhile the Bretonnians worked all day tending the crops, the dawi laboured outside, raising another greenhouse. If not for the runes that kept the temperature stable, the work would have gone much faster, but even so, within days another structure was finished. I quickly brought in more Bretonnians to work it, this time planting barley, stocking up seed and fertiliser reserves.\nThe process repeated without pause: the dawi would finish another greenhouse, and I would fill it with workers. So it went for an entire month, very efficiently, until almost eight greenhouses were operational, with the serfs working without rest. The seeds would be vital for future harvests.\nMeanwhile, I ordered Otto to set aside part of the work in Merxheim—where, at the request of many merchants, he had expanded the harbour far too much—and instead focus on building houses for the serfs near the mining town. That would ultimately be the Bretonnians' workplace, both in the iron mines and in the greenhouses. Iron extraction had to remain constant; with three blast furnaces running, output had fallen behind the daily consumption in the forges.\nThe cold days passed peacefully. I helped where I could inside the greenhouses and kept bringing in more workers each time a new one was finished. Then, as I moved through the fields, I sensed something.\n\"Armour… many… from the east… this model… I know it well… Bretonnian,\" I murmured, detecting the metallic movement several kilometres from my lands.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ\nFor a moment, I felt the urge to butcher every Bretonnian bold enough to attack my domain. But with the witch hunters here… I could not take the same action as Hieronymus. I didn't have the luxury of vanishing after unleashing a storm of magic upon Bretonnians.\nSo, though it displeased me, I had to summon the militia and my personal army. They weren't enough to warrant an emergency, but their likely aim was to cause chaos and draw attention away from their front.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The northern pass is guarded by the Marienburg dissenters. It's almost impossible for them to have avoided all the fortifications and watch posts in the area,\" said one of my bodyguards, clearly angered by the situation.\n\"Probably those treacherous rats thought that selling weapons to both sides would earn them more. They want the war to remain at its height, and when they found out the fronts were at a stalemate, they let them through to reignite the conflict and line their pockets selling in winter, when everything is more expensive,\" said another, gripping his greatsword.\n\"That's possible, but don't forget that the Bretonnians know how to move through the mountain passes. Just as they did at Helmgart, it's also likely they've found routes that let them cross the Grey Mountains to try and raid us,\" I replied as I put on the rest of my equipment.\n\"And how many are there? Did you see anything, my lord?\" asked one of my men-at-arms.\n\"Around four hundred in armour, and a large group carrying only spears. They must be peasants hastily recruited to swell their numbers. From the look of it, they're going to wait for dawn before attempting their attack, since they've set up camp. We must act quickly before they cause damage with their horses, trying to burn granaries or houses,\" I replied.\nMy men nodded and began to gear up. The Bretonnians didn't number more than two thousand, but if they had launched this attack by surprise, they would have caused serious damage. Unfortunately for them, I was here. I believe Hieronymus had also noticed, though he hadn't said anything, likely knowing I was already dealing with the problem.\nI moved to mobilise my personal army, which was already resting in camp, making it easy to gather them for this battle that would soon take place.\nOnce my forces were organised, we prepared to cross the bridges into the rebel state of Marienburg, where the Bretonnian knights were located.\nUsually, there are patrols from the merchant city here, but given the hour, I doubted they'd be in the area. If they're smart, those mercenaries only work when needed, and spend the rest of the day wasting their gold on whatever pleases them.\nAs we crossed the bridge into Marienburg, I felt the presence of the Bretonnians and their camp. We crossed without issue, and on the other side we formed into battle order, advancing as best we could in the dark night, using as few torches as possible.\nWe marched quickly toward them, trying to maintain silence, though the movement of nearly five thousand men, many in plate armour, made it difficult to pass unnoticed.\nWhen we came within sight of the Bretonnian camp, I began to observe it closely. I noticed a clear lack of sentries and the complete absence of a palisade. They had left their horses tied to some nearby trees, grazing—I could make out their shapes moving in the dark. There was no one guarding the entrances to the camp; it was entirely unprotected.\nMy bodyguards covered their eyes and shook their heads. Veterans of a prestigious state regiment, they recognised instantly the many flaws in our enemies' preparations.\nSo, without much delay, we began to move slowly toward them, with the musketeers in the first line. If the Bretonnians came out to face us, the first greeting they would receive would be a lump of lead to the face.\n\"Try to bring down the knights first,\" I whispered to the musketeers in the front.\n\"And how will we know who's who? They're probably without armour, my lord,\" one of my men whispered back.\n\"It's easy. The knights, even without armour, will be wearing soft linen or cotton clothes—white and almost pristine. The peasants, on the other hand, wear rough linen so stained it looks black,\" I replied. My men nodded, ready.\nWe continued forward without encountering resistance until we reached the entrance to the camp. Everything was silent. The Bretonnians slept.\nAt last, someone emerged from a tent, rubbing his eyes with a tired gesture. Even from afar, it was clear he was a noble: white clothes, almost spotless, just as I had described. He yawned, covering his mouth with one hand… and then three muskets fired in unison. Within seconds, the man fell on his back, three massive holes punched through his chest.\n\"Advance now! We won't get another chance—into the camp!\" I shouted.\nMy men charged in like a stampede, bursting into the Bretonnian camp. Chaos was immediate. Confusion gripped the place. Those who came out of their tents to see what was happening received a point-blank shot to the chest. The crack of the muskets echoed between the tents, followed by the dull thud of bodies hitting the ground.\nThe knights were the most exposed: they emerged with their shining swords, but without armour, unable to don it without their squires. The peasants, meanwhile, stayed hidden in their tents, too terrified to come out.\nI saw one of my bodyguards cleave a Bretonnian noble in two at the waist with a single blow, splitting his body in half. Then he slowly turned toward another foe who was trying to retreat and, with a wide sweep of his sword, disembowelled him, spilling entrails across the snow.\nThe muskets kept firing. My men fanned out through the camp, dragging away those who surrendered and killing those who resisted.\n\"Prisoners! I want prisoners!\" I shouted, to keep them from killing everyone. The Bretonnian peasants would be valuable loot—tireless workers and hard to come by in this region.\nThe fighting continued, and I saw one musketeer charge into a Bretonnian knight, driving the bayonet of his musket into the man's abdomen. He twisted the weapon savagely, ripping flesh and viscera as blood spurted in heavy streams. Without releasing the musket, he tore it free with a sharp pull and, in the same motion, spun around to fire into another enemy's chest, dropping him instantly.\nA group of Bretonnians tried to run for the horses, which remained relatively calm thanks to their training as war mounts and their familiarity with the noise of battle. They didn't get far—a close volley from the musketeers struck them, multiple impacts tearing through chests, arms, and legs, leaving them sprawled in the snow.\nThe fighting did not last long. The only ones with the will to fight were the knights and their men-at-arms, but they were few compared to the overwhelming numerical superiority of my forces. The rest of the Bretonnians were peasants without formal training, unable to withstand the pressure of such a sudden and brutal attack.Follow current novels on NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nWithin minutes, the camp was under our control, with the vast majority of the Bretonnians reduced to prisoners.\nI went straight to interrogate one of them, preferably a noble. I found a survivor in white clothes soaked in blood, the result of a cut one of my bodyguards had given him moments before.\n\"Well then, little noble… start talking. Whose brilliant idea was it to come into my lands and cause havoc, eh?\" I said, staring at the Bretonnian.\n\"You…\" he spat in my face.\nI replied with a punch so strong it knocked a tooth out in a single blow.\n\"Listen here, you boot-licker of the Lady. If you think she's going to protect you, you're sorely mistaken. These are the lands of Sigmar, not your Lady, so I won't repeat myself: who had the idea of attacking my lands?\" I asked, locking eyes with him.\n\"I will not speak to the enemy of my Lady. Today I have failed, but many more will come. I am not the first, nor will I be the last—the Lady has shown us your face in our dreams, and soon you will fall,\" the knight shouted.\n\"Ah… a Questing Knight, I suppose. Thank you for the information, idiot… Shoot him,\" I said, standing up.\nOne of my musketeers stepped forward, pressed the barrel to the prisoner's forehead, and fired. The knight fell back, his head shattered.\nI continued interrogating prisoners, but all the nobles reacted the same way—either spitting at me or trying to attack me in desperation. This only confirmed that the Lady was attempting to punish me, sending her lapdogs after me.\nThe one who finally showed a willingness to talk was a man-at-arms. Seeing me execute without hesitation every knight who spoke to me, he began trembling and, without me saying a word, started speaking.\n\"Calm yourself… my anger is not with you, but with your nobles—those who treated you like filth. Speak calmly; nothing will happen to you,\" I told him in a steady voice.\n\"Well… well… all the knights have been having dreams… a peaceful meadow covered in roses, crushed by a blood-soaked Imperial boot… a boy with a coward's weapon destroying a Grail shrine… then that boy turning into an adult, standing over the lifeless body of a Grail knight, and a sky full of banners bearing the twin-tailed comet waving over a ruined Bretonnian castle,\" he said, his voice breaking.\n\"Well… that's exactly what a Grail Knight told me years ago… only with a slight modification,\" I replied, rising to my feet. \"One more question—how did you get into my lands?\" I asked with interest.\n\"We came through the merchants' lands… they opened the gates and let us pass, on the condition that we did nothing within their territory,\" the man-at-arms answered.\n\"Thank you. Nothing will happen to you or your companions… only to the nobles,\" I said, glancing at a pair of Bretonnian knights who went pale.\n\"Will… will you let me go?\" the man-at-arms asked.\n\"No. But I won't execute you like the rest of your nobles. You will live, and I will treat you with respect—just as I will the rest of you,\" I said, turning to my men. \"See to it that the Bretonnian men-at-arms are given comfortable prison quarters. Reopen the dungeons in my castles, clean them thoroughly, and bring in new beds. Avoid overcrowding, and no shackles.\"\nThen I turned to the men-at-arms. \"In consideration of the fact that you are trained warriors, I must keep you confined… unlike the others, who will join the rest of my Bretonnian serfs.\"\n\"What do you mean, 'the rest'?\" another man-at-arms asked.\n\"I have thousands of you in my lands, tending my fields… and I look after them in return. I will do the same with these,\" I replied, looking at the peasants. \"They're just as they were when they arrived—skin and bone. But with three meals a day, they'll be fit for work soon enough,\" I said with a smile. \"Take them away.\"\nThe Bretonnians looked at me with expressions that made it clear they thought I was completely mad.\nWe began looting the camp. There were large stores of wheat and a small amount of barley—likely meant to feed their peasants poorly.\nWe secured a good number of Bretonnian warhorses, and most importantly, their armour, which I could sell or have my men use if necessary. Not everyone is trained to wear such armour—its weight alone was considerable.\nThis needed to be reported to the Emperor: Marienburg was giving aid to the Bretonnians, which could mean that the main Bretonnian army might attempt to cross through Marienburg territory to strike my lands and burn everything while I awaited reinforcements. A dangerous prospect.\nIn addition to reporting this, I needed to distract Bretonnian attention. I went to my pair of armourers and ordered them to stop producing muskets and focus on manufacturing pistols; we would be acting on horseback, and for that, mobility and rapid fire would be essential.\nIt would take a couple of days to have all the equipment ready. In the meantime, I had to investigate whether that dawi tunnel led directly to the Bretonnian side. If it did… I planned to return the favour.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Everything suggests this won't stop; on the contrary, they may well keep trying, since their so-called deity tells them I'm a danger and must be killed,\" I explained.\nDuran frowned deeply. \"Those umgi… never leaving you in peace.\" He stopped, sighed, and pressed his lips together before continuing. \"I wish I could help, dawongi… truly. But I don't have enough warriors for that. I will put their names in my Dammaz Kron, so that in the future, when we have the strength, we can act.\" He shook his head.\n\"Don't worry, I don't need direct intervention from the dawi. But considering that my mountain stronghold is nearly finished—according to the engineer, in little time it will be ready for my warriors to inhabit—I'll need the bridge to the west fortified with a dawi stronghold, and small positions built to station quick-reaction troops and detect incursions more swiftly… Also, is the cannon I requested ready yet?\" I asked, without much concern.\n\"Of course, more work will always be welcome, dawongi. But unfortunately, only one of your orders has been completed. The organ guns you requested… one has been finished. At the moment, the runesmiths are fully focused on creating weapons and tools with the gromril, so their work has been delayed. Everything you request requires runes, since your powder is so powerful it demands the finest materials and inscriptions to withstand its full force. For now, I have only one to show you,\" Duran replied.\n\"That's excellent. One will be more than enough; I'm going to use it, because I plan to go into Bretonnia through the dawi tunnels… of course, if you have no objection. And, if possible, I want to clear every dawi karak we find along the way. Obviously, there's the possibility that the Bretonnians may try to use the same tunnels to counter-attack… so my idea is to leave about two thousand militiamen with you to defend them, creating small blocking points in the galleries,\" I explained.\n\"Of course, my dawongi, I could not deny you passage through my clan's tunnels, especially with the help you offer. But one thing… umgi do not fare well living underground. I've seen the Imperial ambassador to Karak Norn and his men slowly lose their wits during their stay in their quarters… I worry for your warriors,\" said Duran.\n\"Yes, I know. That's why my plan is to rotate them: no more than a week at a time in position, with frequent reliefs, so they don't fall into that madness,\" I replied with a smile.\n\"If that's the case, I have no objections, my dawongi. If there's anything else I can do for you, tell me,\" Duran said.\n\"Of course. I'll make sure my men don't offend yours, and I'll make it clear to them how they are to behave with your warriors. Before departing, I'll leave two garrisons of a thousand men each guarding the tunnels. It would be very helpful if you could build smaller fortifications within them, so they can be reinforced,\" I proposed.\n\"I'll see to it, my dawongi,\" Duran replied.\n\"Any discovery, I'll let you know, my friend. I'll go prepare everything. Have the organ gun ready; I'll depart as soon as possible,\" I said, taking my leave as I walked toward the exit of the karak.\nSince I first had to clear the possible route into Bretonnia, I quickly assembled my personal army and loaded several carts with the supplies needed to establish camps within the great mining tunnels of the dawi. This time I brought the two thousand militiamen I would be leaving in those tunnels. Their stay would be rotational, to prevent the lack of sunlight and sense of time from affecting their minds. I made it very clear that they were to avoid speaking to the dawi and, above all, never make remarks about their height; if they did, they should not be surprised if someone literally lost their head for calling a dawi \"small\" or \"short.\" They were to treat them with respect at all times.\nWith seven thousand men, we marched into the mountains once more. We took the dawi cannon I had requested: a machine with four barrels that fired lead fragments bound with strips of cloth, capable of shredding anything in their path. Though reloading could be tedious—having to charge all four barrels—the weapon was harnessed to a horse like a plough and taken with us.\nAt the first fork we left the first thousand men to guard the passage, to prevent any surprises, and continued to the second dawi karak. The place already showed signs of repair thanks to the work of the master craftsmen, at least on the exterior.\nAfter leaving the second garrison there, we continued our advance. We found numerous dawi miners extracting ore; in many areas the silver was already exhausted, but they worked the gromril with great care, transporting it in rune-sealed chests before sending it to the runesmiths. We pressed on without stopping, making use of every moment before fatigue caught up with us.\nFinally we reached the last discovered karak, where the tunnel split into four routes. We left a small force of five hundred men to temporarily occupy Duran's abandoned stronghold and raise some defensive structure with the timber we had brought.\nThe rest of us entered the tunnel leading toward Bretonnia. After a day of rest to avoid fighting while fatigued, we resumed the march. We had no sense of the hour, without seeing the sun, but everyone was ready.\nWe advanced through vast mining tunnels, inspecting carefully. Using my magic, I could feel that the area was incredibly rich in minerals—iron, tin, copper, silver, platinum… and, above all, an immense vein of gromril. It seemed to lie just beneath something even more important: a massive dawi fortress.\nIt was far larger than any of the other karaks I had seen. The other fortifications seemed tiny in comparison, and the further we advanced, the more I could sense that the structure kept expanding within the mountain.\nBut what also unsettled me was the enormous amount of metal movement I could detect inside. It easily numbered in the thousands… and they probably outnumbered us alarmingly.\nI ordered my men to march in formation until we found a position we could easily defend. I began to notice an increase in rubbish on the ground and, knowing our enemies' habits, it was clear this was the work of greenskins. I hoped it was one of the smaller, more cowardly breeds.\nWe kept moving until we reached a section of tunnel that opened onto a raised area, from which we could see the passage descending toward the entrance of a great karak—much larger than I had expected, and without doubt what Duran had been seeking.\nWe immediately took the best defensive position in the area and set up camp at the top of the slope. We worked hastily on fortifications: if every greenskin inside poured out at once, we would need divine favour to survive.\nConstruction began on a palisade and firing platforms to make the most of the high ground. The dawi cannon was emplaced at the top, ready to fire without pause. We used every resource we had to gain the maximum possible advantage.\nHalfway through the work, the gates of the karak began to open. They were nothing more than crude planks of wood and iron lashed together to seal what had once been a sturdy fortress. From the gap, hordes of goblins began spilling out, followed by orcs who occasionally struck them for sport.\n\"Someone take a shot at them. Get their attention,\" I ordered one of my musketeers watching the greenskins from the line.\nA shot rang out in the tunnel, though the ball fell short of the target. It didn't matter—it was enough to make every greenskin look our way.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAGH!\" the orcs roared, charging straight for our positions. The goblins, hesitant at first, soon followed in a suicidal rush.\n\"Musketeers!\" I shouted. A long line of shooters adjusted their ear protection and aimed down the tunnel.\nAs the greenskins closed the distance, the first volley thundered. Some shots missed, but many found their mark, dropping orcs who went down after taking multiple hits. The goblins, for their part, collapsed from the first bullet to strike them.\nThe firing went on for several minutes until the entire group was wiped out. A handful of goblins turned and fled back into the fortress in terror.\n\"They know we're here now. Finish building quickly,\" I ordered my men, keeping my eyes on the scene, with the dawi organ gun ready to open fire.\nThe work sped up as we drove stakes into the tunnel floor to reinforce the defences on the rocky ground. The soldiers worked with impressive speed—but another force was approaching… a mass of goblins even larger than before, accompanied by a smaller number of orcs, who charged almost immediately.\nThe men dropped their tools and rushed to man the elevated firing positions with their muskets, while others formed a front line with pikes and halberds.\n\"Damn it, they're everywhere!\" one musketeer shouted.\n\"Then shoot at anything that moves!\" another barked back.\nThe first volleys cut down dozens of greenskins. Goblins and orcs fell forward, lead tearing through them. Seeing them bunching up, I turned the organ gun toward them and fired.\nThe metallic roar shook the entire tunnel. Hundreds of goblins died instantly, some orcs laughing at the slaughter—until they too dropped under musket fire.\nWith the help of several men, we reloaded the cannon as fast as possible—clearing the barrels, recharging the powder, and loading the shot. As soon as it was ready, we fired again. This time, dozens of orcs fell at once, along with hundreds more goblins shredded by the blast.\nWe kept up a relentless barrage, reloading as quickly as we could against the oncoming green tide.\nShot after shot, dozens fell until they finally crashed into our lines. The pikemen were the first to take the brunt of the orc charge—leaping fearlessly onto the pikes, impaling themselves but breaking many in the process.\nAt once, I began reinforcing my men's weapons and armour with my magic, so they could better withstand the orcish impact.\nWithout pausing my fire, I swung the organ gun toward a section where hundreds were gathering and unleashed another volley. Again, a storm of shot swept away hundreds of greenskins in a single blast from the four barrels.\nAt last, after suffering enormous casualties, the goblins began to flee, followed closely by the orcs who managed to escape the slaughter. We kept firing while they were still within range of the shot.\nThe ground was carpeted with nearly a thousand corpses from a relatively short fight. We wasted no time—reinforcing the position at once—but before we were finished, more orcs poured out of the karak, followed by an even greater wave of goblins.\n\"This one's going to be tough…\" I muttered, watching the immense number of orcs emerging from the dawi fortress.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

There were massive heaps of bodies, mostly thousands upon thousands of goblins, the result of an ork assault that had not ceased after hours of fighting.\nIt was constant bombardment: every time we drove them back, another wave, even larger, would arrive with yet more behind it, and so on without end. Our lead reserves were slowly running out, with no chance to replenish, since up to that moment the orks had not halted their advance for a single instant. No matter how many fell, more and more always came.\n\"They're falling back, my lord!\" shouted one of the musketeers beside me as he reloaded.\n\"Damn it… Quickly, get the wounded to the rear and swap equipment. It's only a matter of time before the rest arrive. Move, move! Bring powder and fetch more ammunition. I want the muskets loaded and ready—we can't stop,\" I barked, finishing my own reload.\n\"Damn it, there's too many of them… how is it they don't stop coming, no matter how many we kill?\" one of my men said as he slid a canister charge into the cannon.\n\"They're greenskins. Their numbers are vast, but if we keep at it we can break them. It's only a matter of time until they lose their nerve, or their numbers drop enough to stop being a threat,\" I replied while shifting more ammunition toward the cannon.\nWe waited while the musketeers reloaded every musket available to have the maximum number of shots ready. But this time… we waited and waited, and the greenskins didn't come. When I sensed them again, I realised they were all concentrating in another place.\nAll the greenskins were gathering in a specific area—but not against us. They were focused on another presence, one that carried metal with it.\n\"It seems they're not coming. Make use of this and finish the palisade! We must take advantage of every moment we have,\" I called to my men, who immediately set about repairing the damaged fortifications.\nFrom the look of their armour, I was certain: they were skaven.\nOnce I confirmed it, we made full use of the time to reinforce our improvised defences and prepare all equipment in case there was another ork incursion.\nAn hour passed, and the battle below between greenskins and skaven raged on. Their numbers were enormous, but it seemed both sides were tearing each other apart.\nI ordered my men to sleep in shifts and tend to the many wounded. Thanks to my magic, the armour had protected them well from ork axes and hammers—but while it could stop a blade from cutting, it could not nullify the sheer force of the impact. We had few dead, but hundreds wounded, with bruises or broken bones from the orks' brutal strength.\nWhile the camp busied itself with resting, pitching tents, or binding wounds, I slipped away quietly and used my magic to gather all the spent lead shot, restoring it to its original form for reuse. I placed it with the rest of the munitions, working quickly so as not to draw attention.\nIn a few minutes, I recovered all the spent balls and placed them among the ork corpses, then gave the order to collect them.\nWe waited several more hours while the battle between orks and skaven still raged within the karak. During this respite, we managed to reorganise after the brutal greenskin assault… until, as the hours passed, we found ourselves drawn back into the fight.\nYet even so, the ork numbers seemed enormous—greater even than the skaven. Where the battle raged, the greenskins fought in what appeared to be a great cavern, and I could feel all the mineral that surrounded it.\nIt was too good an opportunity to pass up. So, with a group of my men, we crossed the field littered with goblin and ork corpses and moved straight toward the greenskin fortress, taking advantage of the fact they were locked in a death struggle with the skaven.\nUpon entering, we found a foul place, reeking of filth, waste, and an unbearable stench. Thousands of bones were piled high, forming grotesque shapes that looked like some kind of sick art.\nWe advanced quickly, cutting down the goblins that appeared sporadically with well-placed musket shots. Our goal was clear: flank the orks while they were occupied with the skaven.\nWe passed through multiple corridors, some looping back in circles, shooting at anything that moved, until we finally came across a great breach in a dawi wall that opened into a vast cavern. From there, the roars of the greenskins and the constant clash of steel echoed through the tunnel.\nWe moved forward a little and saw the scene: an endless tide of orks battling another tide of skaven, slaughtering each other atop mountains of corpses.\n\"My lord, there's too many,\" said one of my bodyguards, looking at me with the hope I wouldn't give the order to attack.\n\"I know. They're too many for us… even with all the militias from my cities it would be impossible. We should pull back and wait to see how this battle ends. We may have to forget about moving toward Bretonnia—too many greenskins,\" I replied, as I began to channel all the magic of Chamon.\nWhile my men turned to withdraw, I began manipulating the mineral structure of the cavern, slowly weakening it. It was no simple feat—I had to maintain my focus while guiding my men back.\nAfter great effort, I made the minerals vibrate violently, fracturing the rock. It wasn't long before we heard the roar of collapse: the entire cavern caved in behind us. The ground shook, and for a moment it felt as though the entire dawi fortress would come down. Dust billowed out, enveloping everything around us.\n\"By Sigmar, what was that?!\" one of my men shouted, covered in dust.\n\"Must be a sign we should get out of here,\" another said.\n\"No… that was the collapse of the cavern. We're going to check it,\" I replied, spinning on my heel. My men followed reluctantly.\nWe returned to the great cavern and saw it completely buried under tonnes of rock. Everything within had died. Though I could still sense something squirming beneath the rubble, the truth was that kilometres of natural cavern had collapsed over greenskins and skaven alike.\n\"A blessing from Sigmar,\" I said, gazing at the scene. \"The hammer of the god of mankind has fallen upon His enemies.\"\n\"Blessed Sigmar,\" one of my men said, kneeling.\n\"Blessed Sigmar,\" the others repeated, and soon they were all on their knees.\nThe dawi stronghold was almost empty. I could still feel some movement deep below, but nothing compared to what it once was. Who knows how many I killed when I brought it down on them… but in the end, who told them to fight in a cavern full of minerals?\nWith virtually all the greenskins dead, we gathered the rest of my men and began meticulously clearing every one of the many tunnels of the vast stronghold, which was almost labyrinthine.\nEverything was in ruins. Some areas were so devastated it was painful to look at them. Corridors that had once housed dawi forges were now filled with corpses, which we piled into large common pits to be burned. Grand stone buildings and artisan workshops lay in rubble.\nIn several places, we found small, sharp-toothed creatures that attacked in large numbers. They were aggressive and seemed to have been bred as livestock by the greenskins, as many were half-eaten.\nWe kept clearing, only to find more destruction. Everything was ruined, looted, or defiled with the crude, filthy symbols of the greenskins.\nIt took hours to clear the stronghold completely, finding only a handful of orks and many goblins left behind to tend those toothed creatures. By the end of the day, we had cleared everything up to the thane's throne room.\nAs with everything else, there was not a single dawi symbol left. Everything was stained, filthy, or completely destroyed.\nOnce the place was secure and all the greenskin bodies burned, I ordered one of my men to return to Duran and report what we had found. He would surely be pleased to know we had reclaimed his great stronghold.\nWhile the messenger traveled, I inspected all of the dawi's hidden chambers. There were many, though most had already been discovered by the greenskins. I found tombs of important figures of the karak, all plundered.\nThat meant that vast amounts of runic gear were either buried in the collapsed cavern or taken by some ork warboss into the depths. A true shame.\nNot that I could have kept any of it anyway—dwarfs would only give me weapons, and unless any bore runes greater than my sword, they would be of little use to me… unless I wished to equip one of my men with them.\nI found secret dawi forges, with refined minerals that drew Chamon with incredible strength. In other adjoining halls, I discovered libraries, and beyond them, burial chambers belonging to lords and other important figures, filled with gold, jewels, and runic weapons.\nThe amount was so massive I wondered how it was possible for a single stronghold to hold so much runic equipment. And every time I found a plundered hall, I thought of what might still be buried under the collapsed cavern.\nWe spent the rest of the day uncovering every hidden corner of the dawi halls until we found a damaged tunnel protected by several security runes. When we opened it, we discovered it led to the chamber where they kept the gromril. After descending and passing through three more rune-gates, we found the massive vein I had sensed earlier.\nTo say it was large would be an understatement—it was as vast as the stronghold itself. No wonder the dawi had invested so much in protecting it; a single vein like this could be turned into staggering quantities of the finest runic arms, granting immense power and prestige to the clan.\nWe kept opening chambers until we came across a gigantic dawi library, overflowing with more books than I had ever seen in one place.\nAfter resting and fortifying our position, Duran's dawi arrived. Nearly his entire clan had come. Duran himself seemed visibly astonished at our victory.\n\"Duran… a cavern completely collapsed on the greenskins and the raki,\" I said, choosing my words carefully to avoid suspicion. \"I found many secret dawi chambers, most plundered, so I suppose some of your clan's belongings—or those of allied clans—are under that rubble.\"\n\"Yes… it seems the greenskins broke through this wall and forced their way into the karak,\" Duran replied, examining the wall leading to the collapsed cavern.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\n\"Yes, but thanks to Sigmar, the cavern collapsed. You should have seen how many there were… raki against greenskins. Far too many. I had never seen so many in one place, fighting to the death,\" I commented.\n\"It seems the Ancestors intervened in our favor,\" Duran nodded. \"But we will have to put in the work to remove the rubble and recover our people's belongings, so their memory can be honored… Anything else?\"\n\"A massive library… the largest I have ever seen,\" I answered, leading him to the chamber.\nMany dawi followed us, surprise written on their faces, as we walked through what had once been the home of their ancestors.\nWhen we reached the great library, Duran began thanking the Ancestor Gods one by one, visibly moved by the discovery.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I used those hours to stabilize most of my wounded. Around two hundred had died, and nearly a thousand men were injured in this battle against the greenskins. It was a heavy blow, but the orks were too many.\nHad this battle taken place on the surface, they could have easily overwhelmed us by sheer numbers. We probably killed around ten thousand in a matter of hours, thanks to the goblins being easy to pierce and their bodies slowing down those behind them. The orks, however, were tough—very tough—especially when wearing armor. It took several shots to bring them down.\nFortunately, the organ gun could sweep away hundreds of goblins at a time, but against the orks it barely scratched them, their skin, muscle, and armor absorbing most of the impact. Still, as long as the dawi cleaned thoroughly using their techniques, no more greenskins should appear, provided they clear the cavern, which was surely filled with spores. That was most likely where they had entered to attack Duran's ancestral fortress, bringing about the fall of a clan that must have been powerful, having been seated on one of the largest gromril veins I had ever sensed in the Grey Mountains.\nIf that ore was as valuable for runic arms and armor as I believed, it would bring great prestige to Duran's clan. It would surely attract many dawi and secure the clan's lands against the skaven, who seemed to be active in the area. Their Under-Empire tunnels must have reached even this far, probably in search of resources or food for their endless population of slaves.\nLeaving nearly two hundred men to care for the wounded and prepare the dead, I continued with the rest, marching down a tunnel that, for hours, was nothing more than a long, empty passage lit only by dawi stones. Eventually, we reached an exit built by the dwarfs themselves.\nFollowing the path, we found dozens of orks guarding the place, but nothing that a generous amount of hot lead couldn't solve. Once the threat was eliminated, we saw that the exit was blocked, forcing us to remove massive boulders that sealed the entrance.\nWhen we finally broke through, a huge gust of wind rushed into the tunnels. As we stepped outside, I recognized the place instantly.\n\"Bretonnia… I hope you haven't missed me,\" I said, noting that we stood high on a mountain, yet with a manageable descent toward the Bretonnian plains stretching far into the distance. \"Good… we're going back. We have a direct route to Bretonnia. We'll get horses and establish an outpost here.\"\nI left a group of men with supplies to make preparations before we returned with large numbers of horses. We set out immediately for the trip back, resting in the newly reclaimed dawi karak. The dwarfs remained engrossed, reading their ancestors' secrets. They seemed thrilled by the tomes' contents, so we simply loaded our wounded onto the empty supply carts and began the return to Reinsfeld once rested.\nIn a single day, we emerged from the tunnels and brought the wounded to the Cult of Shallya for the best care possible. The dead were delivered to the Cult of Morr to be buried with full honors. My mind was already on how to replenish my forces: though two hundred dead might not seem like much, nearly a thousand wounded—most severely—meant many would likely never wield a weapon again. I would have to recruit soon.\nWasting no time, now that I had a path into Bretonnia, I decided we would go on the offensive. It would be a cavalry raid; I couldn't rely on sheer numbers as I had in other battles against the Bretonnians. Winter would not allow me to move large forces, so I preferred short, hard strikes to discourage them from making more incursions into my lands.\nOnce my duties of delivering the wounded and dead were complete, and after the ceremony at Reinsfeld's church to honor the victory over the greenskins and our aid to our mountain allies, I locked myself in my laboratory. I had to create something better.\nI'm no gunsmith, nor do I know much about weapons; I know the parts of a modern rifle, but the problem is always the material. However, there is one major difference: I am a wizard of Chamon.\nI took one of the pistols my gunsmiths had made for me and began to analyze it with my magic, replicating it with materials I had on hand, many of them \"borrowed\" from my own gunsmiths. I worked the lead, shaping the bullets to better use the rifling of the weapon and make reloading from the muzzle easier.\nUsing the Winds of Chamon, I created a smaller bullet, reducing the weight from nearly a hundred grams to barely thirty. Then I modified the pistol's barrel, as a smaller bullet required a barrel suited to ensure the powder did its work efficiently.\nBy removing steel, reducing the size, and recreating the rifling, I ran tests. Sometimes the barrel was too large, causing the bullet to lose power; other times, it was so small that the weapon nearly exploded in my hands. Thanks to my armor, the wood splinters merely bounced off, and the metal shards remained suspended in the air by my magic.\nAt last, I achieved the exact measurements. The pistol was far lighter and, due to the type of ammunition, offered better penetration—though it would not deal the brutal damage of firing a heavy lump of lead into someone's chest.\nAfter melting down and reusing steel from other pistols, I made the mold for a new round, designed for easy mass production.\nWhen I had a fully functional handgun ready—faster to reload and perfect for a constantly moving war, like the one we would wage in Bretonnia—I prepared several prototypes and delivered them without delay to my blacksmiths and gunsmiths. To the former, I handed numerous bullet molds, ordering them to abandon the previous models and devote all available lead to the new ammunition. To the latter, I gave the pistol prototype with instructions to implement it in all weapons they manufactured from that point onward. I also took almost all the pistols they had ready—about forty in total—which I personally modified to speed up production once back in my workshop.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ\nFor weeks, I dedicated myself almost entirely to supervising the mass production of bullets and pistols. In parallel, I gathered horses, prepared a massive amount of supplies, and from time to time encouraged the wounded who were recovering, also rewarding those who, although incapacitated for battle, continued serving in other areas.\nAt the same time, I selected the best marksmen from my personal army and began training them in horseback riding. Although the training would not be long, it would be enough for them to fire effectively from horseback, taking full advantage of the new pistols. It was two weeks of uninterrupted work.\nAt night, with Hieronymus' help, we began modifying captured Bretonnian armor to adapt it to the Imperial model, making drastic changes. We replaced the original design, which offered full protection, with one focused on the front: chest, arms, face, and legs, leaving only chainmail to cover the back. The weight reduction was considerable, and with it, our mobility increased significantly.\nThus the preparations continued until we finally decided we were ready. With abundant supplies, we set out back to Bretonnia. Along the way, we discovered that the dawi had kept their word: the route to Helmgart was blocked by a small stone wall defended by a detachment of militiamen.\nTaking the western route, we found another fortification: a second stone wall guarded by my own militia. Further ahead, upon reaching the empty karak, we saw that the dwarfs had erected defenses in the area, with several warriors standing watch. They greeted us as we passed, and we continued on to the great karak.\nWhen we reached it, we discovered that much of the fortress had been repaired. At the entrance, the dawi were clearing the collapsed cavern. They used a machine that boiled water and expelled steam under pressure through pipes, likely to burn spores. It was operated by a heavily armored dwarf, while others removed rocks and cleared the way.\nIn the upper halls of the karak, I looked for Duran, but he was not on the throne. One of his warriors led me to a chamber where there was a secret forge. I immediately felt a magical accumulation in the air, as if something was drawing in the Winds of Magic. They made me wait outside for a while until finally the guardians allowed me to enter.\nnside there were few dwarfs: Duran, a runesmith, and what seemed to be his assistants. The runesmith, burly and with arms as thick as my head, was drenched in sweat; he wiped his face with a cloth, his muscles tense from the effort.\n\"Dawongi… I apologize for the delay in receiving you, but my kinsman was finishing some runes,\" said Duran.\n\"I can see that. Duran, I'm on my way to Bretonnia… it would be of great help if your dawi could build fortifications at the tunnel exit, in case we return with company,\" I replied.\n\"Of course, dawongi… I'll send whoever is available,\" the thane answered, nodding.\nThe runesmith's assistants approached with measuring instruments and began taking my measurements—arms, legs, torso, and head. I crouched to make their work easier.\n\"And this?\" I asked curiously.\nDuran smiled faintly. \"When you recovered Karak Kronaz, the Fortress of Books, we found knowledge we thought lost forever. Among its archives were copies, of copies, of copies… until we reached what seem to be original texts, legacy of the first heirs of the ancestor gods. Dawongi… what those books contain is worth more than all the gold, and perhaps even more than all the gromril in this fortress.\n\"Recently, I sent my fastest with a message to High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer, informing him of what we have recovered… and also of what you have done. I have asked the High King to intercede with the Runesmiths' Guild to grant me permission to present you with a gromril armor with runes. The specific runes still need to be determined… but if the information in those books is correct, we may… we may have rediscovered how to forge master runes,\" Duran said, barely containing his excitement.\n\"Ah, well… no wonder you were so excited about the books. Of course… it makes perfect sense, that information is worth more than all the gold in these mountains,\" I said, resting my hands on my hips.\n\"Exactly. This must be reported to all the karaks. All must know the valuable information these walls safeguard. This karak must never fall again… it must be protected as the relic it is,\" Duran replied solemnly.\n\"Calm down, my friend, all in due time. I'd like to assign more guards, but this year, with the war in Bretonnia, no soldiers were discharged, and those are the ones I usually hire for this work. However, I believe I can send another thousand men to garrison this karak until more dawi arrive to guard it properly,\" I replied, noting the satisfaction on the dwarfs' faces.\n\"If all goes well, perhaps in the coming centuries, when we regain the skill of the ancestors, master runes will be forged again as in the glorious days. They will protect the great lords, their personal guards… and also you, dawongi… or your descendants,\" said Duran.\n\"I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to stay to celebrate with you, but duty calls… and the Lady's feet lickers won't stop bothering me until I make them bleed, my friend. I'm counting on you for the work,\" I replied, bidding him farewell with a wave before leaving the karak.\nWe resumed our ride towards Bretonnia and reached the camp, where a group of my men kept a sharp watch for any threats.\n\"Ah… Bretonnia… time to kidnap more peasants,\" I said with a grin, checking that the six pistols integrated into my armor were ready.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

No killing peasants—if they don't resist, take them prisoner. Two silver shillings for every peasant captured, one crown for a knight. The loot will be split half for me and half for you, but if this goes well, I'll gladly give up my share. And let it be clear: no dropping your trousers. I won't waste time on that. Anyone I catch doing such a thing, I'll hang from the first tree I find. Understood?\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" they answered in unison.\n\"Good, let's go. Descend carefully; there's a path the orcs used, but it's still steep. I don't want anyone falling because they weren't paying attention,\" I ordered as I began to ride down the trail carved by years of orc traffic.\nFive hundred riders descended calmly, without meeting resistance. According to the information I had, the front was stalled several kilometers to the east. Ever since the Imperial army had been defeated and forced to cede territory, the line had been fixed at Montfort, where Imperial and Bretonnian forces were now blocked by the snow, waiting for better weather to resume the campaigns.\nFor obvious reasons, there were no settlements near the point where we descended—it would have been the first thing the orcs burned and looted, being so close to the entrance of the Dawi mines. Once at the bottom, we marched west in search of Bretonnian villages that would be easy prey; with their forces concentrated at the front, resistance would be scarce, and we could move at will.\nIt didn't take long to find the first target of the day. As we moved away from the Grey Mountains, through the snow, the smoke of a village became visible to the naked eye, though it came from a single house.\nWe galloped toward the place. The peasants, upon seeing us, stepped out of their homes only to quickly lock themselves inside after realizing we were men of the Empire.\n\"You know the drill… no unnecessary deaths, but don't pull them out of their houses just yet,\" I ordered.\nWe headed for the granary, full of grain sacks. \"Bingo… we've got food to sustain the raid for several days,\" I said with a smile. \"Use those carts and load the sacks. Let's see what's in that noble's house.\"\nI kicked the door open and stepped in with both pistols raised. A scream echoed inside. Before me, a young man in chainmail and sword in hand tried to protect his family.\nI looked around: only malnourished Bretonnian peasants.\n\"I'm not going to waste ammunition on you. Drop the sword and you'll save me the trouble of killing you,\" I told him in Bretonnian, holstering my pistols. The young man, ignoring his mother's cries as she shielded two children, charged at me, attempting a thrust.\nI deflected the blade with my right gauntlet and delivered a heavy blow to his abdomen. The air burst from his lungs, and he collapsed backward onto the wooden floor. Without delay, I planted my boot on his throat and began to press down.\nThe young man's eyes went wide, and with a muffled grunt he brought both hands to my boot, trying to push it away. His fingers clutched the leather tightly, shoving desperately, but he barely managed to shift me a centimeter. His face began to redden, then turned a purplish shade as the veins in his neck bulged.\nHe struck my shin with a closed fist, tried to twist to the side to break free, but each time he did, I increased the pressure, forcing more weight onto his windpipe.\n\"You should have listened to your mother,\" I muttered, watching him struggle, his heels drumming against the floor in an instinctive search for leverage.\nThe mother, seeing her son kicking and gasping more faintly with each second, lunged at me, scratching my shoulder and slapping at my helmet. I grabbed her arm, twisted her aside, and was about to give her a hard punch… until I saw the terrified eyes of her two small children fixed on me.\n\"Bah… I don't want the trauma of two children on my conscience,\" I said, lifting my boot and releasing the woman.\nThe young man rolled to his side, coughing violently and clutching at his neck, struggling to breathe.\nI finally gave the order to capture all the peasants. Shouts filled the village as they were subdued, tied up, and loaded onto carts along with the sacks of wheat. A group of my men took the horses belonging to the knight who ruled the place and set off toward the mountains, escorting the prisoners and the food.\nThe rest of us kept searching for villages among the vast farmland. We found two small hamlets similar to the first, each with no more than two hundred souls. We took them without firing a single pistol; as expected, defenses were minimal, and with winter upon them, it was rare to find sentries outside, exposed to the cold.\nEverything went smoothly until we reached what appeared to be a large settlement. If my knowledge of Bretonnian maps was correct—or the Imperial cartographers hadn't made a mistake—this village was Tharravil, located on the Bretonnian trade route, which explained its size.\nWe advanced at a gallop, though with fewer forces: I had left men behind as guards for the transport of prisoners and supplies. From a distance, the hills revealed a settlement of between three and five thousand people. The presence of several well-built houses suggested merchants or even a noble in the area; these were not the mud and timber hovels where Bretonnian peasants usually lived.\nWasting no time, and detecting only a few metallic presences that might pose a threat, I gave the order to advance.\n\"Split up and block the main exits. Try not to kill anyone. Remember: 'Drop your weapon and you will live!'. If they keep resisting, fire,\" I instructed, making sure they knew the exact words to shout in Bretonnian.\nWe divided into small groups. The first thing we came across were a few men-at-arms, spears raised, trying to form up to stop us. However, seeing that we were far too many, they stepped aside.\nTwo groups of four riders dismounted and charged at them, knocking them down with punches to subdue them. The rest of us continued towards the village centre, where I spotted a group of knights who seemed surprised by our presence.\nI drew two pistols and fired immediately, while my men also opened fire. I holstered the weapons and unhooked two more from my armour. The knights, who had been chatting calmly moments before, fell to the ground under a rain of lead. My men dismounted to check if any were still alive, while others kept galloping to wipe out any remaining resistance.\nMore shots rang out in the village. Peasants ran in all directions, only to find that every escape route was blocked. Many barricaded themselves inside their homes, hoping the storm would pass.\nThe looting went smoothly: knights shot down, men-at-arms captured, most offering no resistance. Unlike the knights, who trusted the Lady to protect them, a man-at-arms knew exactly what it meant to see his lord fall under enemy fire.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nWe quickly gathered all prisoners capable of fighting into the village centre under strict guard, while a small group of us began forcing our way into the merchants' houses. Many had furniture and makeshift barricades blocking the doors, but that only delayed the inevitable. No one could complain about the silver clinking inside their chests.\nOnce the entrance was broken and the blockade removed, we stormed in. The inhabitants were subdued and tied up without hesitation. We searched every corner and took everything of value: silk, large quantities of linen, balls of wool, and several barrels of silver coins stored in the main merchant's home. We also found amphorae of spices well hidden, but not enough to escape my men's eyes.\nOutside, every house that looked wealthy was looted. We found even more silver coins, and even some gold ones the merchants kept hidden from their lords.\nIn the knights' homes there was a bit more resistance. Their men-at-arms tried to stop us, but facing pistols with spears was not their best idea. Soon we had captured the noble families and taken everything: armour, swords, chests of Bretonnian coins, and stables full of warhorses—easily sold for a fortune in Imperial markets, or kept for breeding in my own stables.\nThe looting lasted almost two hours without rest. We entered every important house, tying up its inhabitants with whatever was at hand. Some tried to hide in the attics, which cost us a bit of time, but none escaped.\nBy the end of the day, with carts and captured horses, emptied granaries, and amassed riches, we sent everything towards the mountain pass, heavily escorted due to the large number of prisoners. I was left with barely three hundred men to continue the campaign.\nDuring the rest of the day, we plundered two smaller villages. They were not as valuable as Tharravil, but the total loot from the first day of raids was already more than satisfactory.\nWe kept advancing until, in the distance, we spotted a small castle. Although well-defended, its garrison was clearly outnumbered. As I focused, I recognised the metallic design of the drawbridge mechanism and the iron gate—the same I had seen in Montfort.\n\"Looks like we'll be sleeping in comfort tonight,\" I murmured with a grin.\nI closed my eyes for a moment and channelled my magic. The metal responded as if it were an extension of my own hands. The internal gears of the drawbridge began to turn with a high-pitched squeal, and the chain, which normally required the effort of several men, started to tighten on its own.\nThe chains groaned and the bridge slammed down against the frozen ground. Next, I did the same with the iron gate. The internal bolts clicked open with a sharp sound, and the heavy leaves began to lift, as if an invisible giant were pushing them from within.\n\"Look, ! They've left the gates open! Move!\" I shouted, spurring my horse.\nWe stormed in at full speed, over two hundred hooves pounding the ground in a deafening roar. A group of men-at-arms and knights tried to form up hastily in front of us. The first shots thundered, and their formation broke before they could stand their ground. My men, without slowing down, fired and tossed their empty pistols into the snow, drawing loaded ones to keep up the attack.\nThe courtyard turned into a chaos of gunfire, shouting, and the pounding of warhorses' hooves. The defenders fell one after another, unable to understand how they had lost their main defence before even drawing their swords. We used those precious seconds to reload and charge into the castle's interior.\nIn the corridors, confusion still reigned. Some tried to shut inner doors; others fled, dropping their weapons. We advanced quickly, unleashing such firepower that no attempt at resistance could hold.\nIn just a few minutes, the fortress was under our control. The heavy gates were closed again—this time under our command—and silence replaced the clamour of battle.\nThat night we would sleep behind secure walls, and tomorrow, the looting would continue.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

With most of the Bretonnian forces encamped to the east, much of their land lay completely undefended and ready to be harvested.\nDuring a short five-day campaign, my men and I quite literally swept through every defenseless village near Gisoreux, one of the richest and most influential Bretonnian cities. With the meager number of troops I commanded, we could not hope to take the city—not even with all my mastery over the Winds of Chamon—but we had more than enough men to empty dozens of hamlets and two sizable towns, all while the Bretonnians remained blind and deaf to what was happening in their very heartland.\nOf course, it was obvious that not everything would go unnoticed. It didn't take long for companies of yeomen to appear, harassing us at every opportunity. They were clearly no match for us, armed only with spears or bows, and we always denied them a straight fight. Whenever they tried to intercept us or prevent the transport of prisoners, we charged, opened fire with our pistols, and then scattered in every direction, keeping up the shooting as we circled them.\nThey were problems easily solved with powder, but they also cost us time. We had to hunt them down to the last man to ensure they never carried word of our position or routes. I would not allow the Bretonnians to discover the secret pass we used. The orcs had passed unnoticed through it who knows when; I would not be the one to expose it just because I was filling my granaries with Bretonnian grain, wine, oats, legumes, and livestock. Any hostile force we met had to be eliminated.\nThe problem was that, as the days passed, each village or town we came across was already garrisoned by more Bretonnians. That reduced our technological advantage and made continued raids less profitable. It forced us to look for other targets, wasting time and resources, until finally they outnumbered us far too greatly. At that point, I decided to end the expedition: at any moment, a large force of knights could appear and crush us with their sheer weight and speed.\nSatisfied with what we had gained, and making sure our tracks were as hard to follow as possible, we took alternate routes and traveled only when snow was falling to cover our trail. After several days of successful captures, we returned to the mouth of the cave.\nIn the forward camp, the dawi were building fortifications inside the cavern itself. We quickly sealed the entrance with rocks, just as the orcs had once done to hide their passage into Bretonnia.\nI immediately began reviewing the figures for this campaign, which were far from insignificant considering how few we were. One of my men—one of the few who could read and write—handed me a report stating that we had captured around ten thousand Bretonnians, one hundred men-at-arms, tons of grain, and thousands of head of livestock, all now being transported to the Imperial side of the mountains.\nMy men and I handled only the last two hundred peasants we had taken, and then began our return to Reinsfeld without further incident. On the way, we crossed paths with the dawi, still cleaning the cavern and checking every recovered book, copying them without pause. We also met the militia reinforcements that had arrived and were now camped in their assigned zones, easing the strain the Duran clan faced from its lack of warriors.\nAfter a day's rest in one of the karaks, we finally left the mountains and were greeted by the cold winter air of the Empire.\n\"If the war with Bretonnia drags on, we should spend a summer over there…\" I said to my men, who answered with grins.\n\"We've made a fortune, my lord,\" said one.\n\"Whenever you wish, next year we'll find—by Sigmar's blessing—the open gates of one of their cities… and sack it completely,\" I replied with enthusiasm.\n\"Without doubt, a campaign blessed by Sigmar,\" added another.\n\"Blessed be Sigmar,\" repeated another, and soon all joined in unison, giving thanks to the god of the Empire.\nI divided the loot among the participants and those who had guarded the base camp, leaving most of them wealthy men, with the means to buy land or invest in workshops. This, while increasing their independence away from my strict control, also sent a clear message to future recruits: not every campaign meant death—some could bring considerable riches. In this one, we had only suffered wounds from arrows or blades, but no deaths. All returned with dozens—sometimes hundreds—of gold coins in their pockets, ready to be spent.\nTheir work was done… mine, however, was far from over.\nAfter nearly three weeks away from my administrative duties, I found myself buried under mountains of paperwork: witch hunter reports, hundreds of applications for trade patents, and procedures to establish posts in Merxheim. My 1% tax policy had attracted practically every merchant in the region, displacing Schilderheim as a commercial hub. That must have had its rulers fuming, all the more so as their city lost influence to a market that, though still underdeveloped, moved much of my production.\nThe only positive thing about this winter was that migration had been low. Of course, at certain points thousands of new militiamen had arrived with their families, but in recent months the flow had stopped. The only way to increase my population now would be with Bretonnians… and in that sense, this campaign had been productive.\nWhile we were away, new houses had been built in the mining village, along with communal barracks to house—albeit a bit cramped—all my new serfs. They were eager to work once they regained their weight, as most arrived malnourished. All the captured food would be allocated to them. In a way… I had lost money, but the looting of merchants in Bretonnia left me barely breaking even.\nThe real investment was in the future—these Bretonnians would generate constant income working in my mines and fields. I now had a workforce of seventy-two thousand serfs available at all times. The newcomers might need a bit of a firm hand to adapt… but not for long.\nSo I spent the rest of the year reviewing paperwork and supervising construction. The dawi had finished the fortress in the mountains, which was now practically impregnable. Little by little, I began to move my administrative center there, leaving the old castle in Reinsfeld to be occupied by administrative officers who would arrive next year. When they graduated from university, a good number of literate commoners—whom I had already offered jobs—would also arrive; this time with more luck, since, although my influence in the city was still limited, I managed to attract an outstanding group instead of settling for the usual mediocre ones. But that would be for next year.\nThe construction of my Sigmarite school had also been completed and was already fully operational. Several additional classrooms had even been added, as with the increase in population there were nearly eight thousand students who had to attend classes every day, distributed in different shifts throughout the day.\nMeanwhile, the Cult of Sigmar had begun building a temple in Merxheim and another in the mining village, as both had quickly become important population centers.\nOtto continued with his projects, although now working with less urgency thanks to the low influx of migrants. Even so, his large crew of workers allowed him to progress quickly, and he remained under my constant pressure—especially when I ordered him to begin construction on the hospital and the great Temple of Shallya, a project approved after months of waiting by Altdorf, which sent dozens of new priests to Reinsfeld to staff the building and attend to health and childbirth.\nAnd it was urgent. The peasants reproduced like rabbits and, at certain times, the Temple of Shallya was full of pregnant women. With each passing month, the need for that hospital became more evident.\nBut the most surprising thing of all was the presence of Sigmarite priests among the Bretonnians. With my support, they regularly visited the barracks where the newly arrived groups lived, gave them lessons about the god of humanity, and gradually taught them Reikspiel. The conversion advanced quickly: many had already converted en masse to the Cult of Sigmar, although they still kept the Lady as a secondary patron deity.\n\"And thus, our great Emperor Magnus the Pious, chosen of Sigmar and unifier of our eternal Empire, crushed the forces of evil, driving them north and bringing peace to the lands of Sigmar,\" proclaimed a young priest with fervor, raising high a silver figure of the god in his battle pose. The Bretonnians listened with attention and devotion, following each word as the image gleamed in the firelight.\n\"Blessed Sigmar,\" the Bretonnians repeated in still-clumsy but understandable Reikspiel.\n\"That is why Sigmar is our god, god of humanity and protector of all men, no matter their origin. It does not matter if they were born in Reikland, Middenland, Stirland, Ostland, or in the Bretonnian duchies… as long as they are human and give him devotion, the god of this Empire will never abandon them. Sigmar always protects his own, but it is also the duty of his own to serve him: to protect the Empire, to protect our friends in the mountains, and to fight evil wherever it is found. It is our obligation as his heirs… as humans… to bring his light wherever darkness reigns and to banish the corrupt with his holy purifying fire.\"\nAs he spoke these words, the young priest's hands and eyes filled with a golden light. The more fervor he put into his speech, the more intense the glow became, and the hammer-shaped amulet around his neck shone almost white, illuminating the faces of the Bretonnians who listened in reverent silence.Follow current novels on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nAll the Bretonnians bowed their heads and began to pray to Sigmar for protection.\nThe priest looked at me while his body, eyes, and hands still glowed, and he calmed himself after what seemed to have been a great speech delivered to hundreds of Bretonnians.\n\"Graf Albrecht… to what do I owe the honor of the presence of one who has been blessed with visions of the great Sigmar?\" said the young Sigmarite priest.\n\"I only seek to fulfill my duty as a Sigmarite, making sure that those under my care are in good condition… and so I see, priest. A great story… I must say it has filled me with fervor,\" I said with a smile.\n\"In dark times, we all need the light of Sigmar, graf…\" replied the priest, turning to the Bretonnians. \"Here, brothers in faith… here you have the perfection of a Sigmarite noble: Graf Albrecht. A man touched by the hands of the divine Sigmar, receiving visions of what is to come, for he has never failed in his duty. He has never fled from battle. He has always attacked evil, helped our friends in the mountains… being the example of what every lord should be.\"\nThe priest continued his speech, and the Bretonnians listened with eyes full of devotion to Sigmar. It seemed my plan to integrate them was working… perhaps too well. They showed no resistance at all, which was strange. Very strange. No one accepts losing their traditions easily, and yet here they were, worshiping Sigmar as their patron god. It must have been, without a doubt, the charisma of these priests—capable of what even I found surprising. Just a few months ago, these men and women worshiped the Lady, and now their faith was devoted to the god of the Empire.\n\"I will have to keep his name in mind to recommend him to some temple,\" I murmured as I left the barracks to continue inspecting the progress on the constructions.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Fortunately, this time there was no cultist attempt to open a portal, though certain rituals were still detected that left us somewhat puzzled. The witch hunters, led by their captain, had dismantled a large network of cultists from Nordland who worshiped Slaanesh. No direct symbols of the Prince of Excess were ever found, but their activities gave them away: they engaged in massive orgies that they couldn't hide for long from the watchful eyes of the hunters. Still, that was all towards the year's end.\nInstead of daemons, just human cultists. An improvement in itself, though the growing population was making it increasingly difficult to maintain control with my limited military forces. I was still hoping for some state regiments to be discharged so I could recruit veterans; training my own troops from scratch just to use them as well-paid guards was costly and inefficient.\nAll my attention remained focused on overseeing the works. Early in the year, nearly a hundred clerics and members of the Cult of Shallya arrived to occupy their new great temple-hospital. Although it was still in its early construction phases, at least Otto had prioritized a modular design—something his men were already experts in: they always built in a way that allowed parts of a structure to be used before completion. Thanks to that, some of the first halls were already operational.\nThey arrived at the perfect time, as births had seen an almost phenomenal boom in recent weeks. I don't know what got into the peasants, but they all decided it was a good time to have children. In fourteen years they would be working hands, but for now, they meant a considerable extra expense. My donations to the Temple of Shallya this year would be very high, as I had to cover a large part of the costs of supporting the population.\nFortunately, the increase in sales of my products in Merxheim allowed me to cover much of these new expenses. Besides, I could always dip into the dwarven gold that still filled Duran's old karak. The dawi had immediately moved to protect their new great karak, leaving my first reconquest as a dwarven outpost dedicated to the crafts of my house, with artisans and engineers working under my orders and teachings.\nEspecially since many dawi clans had begun to arrive, for their passage through my lands had not gone unnoticed. Hundreds of them traveled my roads toward my fortress, and each day new contingents arrived to populate the empty karaks of Clan Duran. With them came a huge number of skilled workers, adding their hands and knowledge to our projects: construction of greenhouses, raising of defenses, and improvement of routes.\nOnly the engineers and artisans of Clan Duran had the right to work with my gunpowder and pigments, but all other newly arrived dawi were employed in two key projects for me: building a bridge large enough to allow the passage of a great military contingent toward Marienburg's lands, and a series of fortifications to protect the border, now that it was possible the Bretonnians might attempt new incursions while I was occupied in other campaigns.\nWith that, my western flank was secure. I planned for this year to be peaceful… or at least relatively peaceful, because I was already thinking about returning to Drakwald—this time to cause a true massacre against the beastmen. Every week, the dawi delivered new organ guns to me; all it would take was clearing the forest of trees to create a perfect line of fire for the canister shot.\nBut before thinking of future victories against the plague that ravaged the Imperial forests, I had to put my house in order. Every time I left, I would return to administrative chaos. I was used to solving problems day by day, but all administrative work fell to me: decision-making power was concentrated solely in my hands, and no one else had the authority to sell or deliver anything without my permission.\nA single week of absence meant hundreds of commercial licenses awaiting approval, new tax documents that had to be reviewed and organized, the approval of trial results, witch hunter investigation reports, and building permits Otto deemed necessary, among many other things that had to cross my desk.\nThat's why I looked forward to the arrival of graduates from Altdorf's universities, so I could establish a proper administration and delegate some of my lesser powers. Even so, I was concerned: the system worked because the tax collectors were terrified of the possible punishments, and because I knew how to summon anyone to interrogation if they failed in their duties… even if it was just a single copper coin. If someone softer, or less interested in my personal fortune, took the helm, it was possible everything could start going wrong.\n\"So finally… my greatest nightmare has arrived,\" I muttered as I went through a mountain of petitions from artisan guilds of various trades, all seeking official recognition in my cities and to operate as guild bodies… yet already demanding conditions before I had even accepted them.\nThe brewers' guild, for example, wanted me to be expressly forbidden from participating in their market at any event. The Altdorf smiths' guild wanted to open a branch here, but in exchange demanded the dismantling of my own military industry and the transfer of all its management to them \"so they could run it better.\"\nAnd so it went with many others: guilds demanding monopolies, seeking to force all independent artisans to join their ranks, as if they were doing me a favor by coming to my lands.\nIt made me want to hang those guild representatives to death—those who think themselves indispensable, who act as if I need them, and who believe themselves so important.\n\"Rejected… rejected… rejected… rejected… rejected… rejected,\" I said, stamping my seal on each of the applications, denying their requests.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n\"Rats… filthy rats…,\" I muttered, thinking of a solution. It was only a matter of time before the guilds forced me to accept them; some wield so much power and influence that even the Emperor himself has been forced to yield to them in certain cases. A city without guilds is a market ripe for exploitation, and now that I had a stable economic base and no immediate threats, it was the perfect time for them to try to enter.\nThat is how many nobles have lost control of their cities: when guilds gather more real power than their own rulers. There are even cities that have expelled their lords, and the Empire has accepted this form of government to avoid another case like Marienburg.\nFor now, my power was firmly rooted… but who could assure me those powerful guilds would not try to take away what I had built?\nAfter much thought, I concluded that the only way to strengthen my presence in the city was to expand my control over local industries and establish monopolies so solid they would crush any competition.\n\"But that would destroy the local craftsmen… and that would quickly turn into public unrest, rebellions, cultists, or worse—attempts to form local guilds,\" I thought, discarding the idea.\nControl of food, on the other hand… would only affect the peasants, and if I offered them their same work back, they wouldn't care. If I reclaimed all rights to the land and, of course, compensated them with gold for the acquisition, they would be satisfied… without realizing the city would be under my near-total control. In the end, the only way to obtain food would be through licensed merchants, and I could deny that right to whomever I wished. As long as I kept my armies happy, well-fed, and pampered, nothing could happen to me.\n\"Let's do it.\"\nI immediately began drafting a decree obligating everyone to surrender their rights to the land in Reinsfeld. As compensation, five crowns would be paid per hectare; with an average of three hectares per family, that meant fifteen gold crowns per year for a period of five years. Considering around twelve thousand families, the total expense would be about one hundred and fifty thousand gold crowns—slightly more than my monthly trade income, but in the long run, it would guarantee me complete control over local agriculture, paving the way to industrialize it.\nI acted at once. I summoned my tax collectors, and taking advantage of the early hours of the day, the time had come to make myself master and lord of all the land. From now on, new immigrants would be offered gold instead of land; when I began introducing modern plows, new agricultural techniques, and industrial fertilizers, I would become the breadbasket of the Empire.\nWith my collectors and a detachment of soldiers at my back, we went door to door throughout the city, taking advantage of the fact that this month the land would not be worked until the plowing season began. For now, their owners did not see the real value of their fields, but in their eyes, gold shone much brighter.\nThe real cost would be in the new wages, as between thirty and forty thousand people were of working age. Paying them all a silver shilling a day—twice what they earned on average—would reduce the backlash to the loss of their land-use rights.\nSo, armed with the knowledge from the land registry, a great amount of Bretonnian gold, and the dwarven gold stored in Duran's karak, I joined my collectors to deliver the news in person.\nI knocked on the door of one of the houses in the city's old quarter and waited. It didn't take long for the father of the family to appear, wrapped in furs and heavy clothes, still affected by the chill of the year's first month.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar,\" I said, making the comet's salute. \"Worker of my lands,\" I added with a smile, holding a bag of gold in my hand.\n\"My… milord,\" the peasant replied, visibly surprised.\n\"I've come to inform you that I wish to buy your rights to use the land,\" I said, tossing him the bag of coins and a gold piece changed into silver shillings.\nThe man caught it, staring at me in bewilderment for a few seconds… until he checked its contents. His eyes went wide.\n\"Eh… how… well…\" he muttered, scratching his head.\n\"This will be your first annual payment. For the next five years, you will receive the same amount. But now, the land you work is mine again,\" I explained, pointing to the bag of gold.\n\"But, milord… that… leaves us without livelihood…\" he said nervously, as more members of his family got up to listen.\n\"Don't worry. Now you will all work for me as employees, with a salary of one silver shilling a day. You'll do the same work as before, but under my supervision. You won't have to worry about whether the harvest is good or bad… your only obligation will be to do your job,\" I replied with a smile.\n\"Ah… I… thank you, milord,\" the peasant answered, somewhat calmer.\n\"Work will begin next week. All members fit to work the land must report,\" I ordered, walking away.\nWe followed the same procedure with all my trusted men, keeping a fixed script so the conversation would lead to a less violent outcome. I knew there would be those who would not take the change kindly, but in the end, a small tyrannical act every now and then wasn't so bad.\nDuring the following days, we dedicated ourselves exclusively to that: paying compensations, offering employment, taking control of the land, and changing the land registry records to my name.\nThe most difficult were the city's notables. They owned vast lands and some power, but there we applied more muscle than diplomacy: a strong guard presence and a clear explanation that there were no options. The land was mine; they would accept the gold and remain silent.\nAnd so, until the entire city had received my gold and I had nearly emptied my coffers, keeping only a few tens of thousands of crowns. Better for gold to be in motion than gathering dust. Finally, I ordered the return of the dwarven gold to replenish the coffers and ensure I had funds for future wages.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It lacked the walls to be considered a true city, but it was clearly well on its way there.\nI had managed to earn the recommendations and grades needed to serve under Graf Albrecht. I hadn't quite bested the top of the class, but this posting was still an excellent opportunity. Father could no longer pull strings to get all of us into Altdorf's administration, so this was a good start.\nThe Graf was a wealthy man thanks to trade, his name known in the Imperial courts. Merxheim, one of his cities, had been the cause of no small amount of trouble for the merchants of Schilderheim. Now it was time to serve him and, with luck, secure a good administrative position where I could settle.\nThe trip from the port of Schilderheim to Reinsfeld was short, marked by the many militia encampments along the road. The number of men stationed to keep the route safe surprised me; they made certain nothing bad would happen.\nOur arrival was met with silence. The peasants were probably out in the fields working. The carriages stopped at the entrance to the castle, which stood atop a hill.\nAround sixty graduates disembarked and began moving toward the interior. The castle bustled with workers cleaning and tidying, as if it had been left unused for a long time.\n\"Strange, isn't it?\" I said to one of my companions.\n\"A bit… what noble leaves his castle in such a state that it needs this much cleaning now?\" he replied.\n\"As long as he pays what he promised…\" another muttered.\nThe guards led us to the great hall. As we moved down the corridors, we heard loud laughter from inside. The doors opened, revealing the Graf seated among a group of dwarfs, all laughing as they drank from enormous tankards of beer.\n\"My lord, the graduates from the University of Altdorf have arrived,\" a guard announced. The young Graf's smile faded into a sharp, piercing gaze.\n\"So you've finally arrived…\" he said, rising to his feet. He studied us carefully as we entered, raising an eyebrow now and then at the attire of some.\n\"These are the umgi who will be working for us,\" one of the dwarfs remarked.\n\"That's right, Thorek. These are some of the finest Altdorf graduates in administration, accounting, and imperial tax law. The idea is for them to help you manage my cities more efficiently. With their support, Reinsfeld will prosper. Here you have the master treasurer, the master tax collector, the master of the port, the master of agriculture, the master architect, and the master auditor. They will be your new supervisors and will handle the paperwork for finances,\" the Graf explained with a smile.\nThe dwarfs nodded. One lit his pipe and looked us over calmly.\n\"I warn you: if any of you insult our dawi friends, I will not hesitate to have the headsman's axe sharpened,\" the Graf said grimly.\nWe swallowed hard.\n\"Oi, dawongi, don't be so harsh with these pups. We know they won't mean to offend us—they just might not yet know how to address the dawi respectfully,\" said a white-bearded dwarf, the treasurer.\n\"Thank you, Harrik, I appreciate that. Right, you'll split into groups of ten and go with your new supervisors. For what I'm paying you, I expect exemplary work,\" the Graf concluded.\nWe quickly divided into groups and received our first assignment: hire another ten civil servants from among the townsfolk who could read and write. It wouldn't be easy—very few in the city had that skill. On top of that, I was to oversee all monetary movements on the Graf's behalf and audit my fellow graduates to ensure spending was efficient and transparent. Corruption here wasn't punished with fines—if someone was caught diverting funds, they'd have their hands cut off and be thrown into the beastman-infested forest.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Unfortunately, the very best in the Empire always served the Emperor, the Elector Counts, or the high local nobility—margraves and dukes—but I was no longer the last link in the political chain, so I could bring in more capable people. And I was already seeing the benefits… although, of course, I wasn't about to let those fools, just because they had good grades, get their sticky hands on all my income. That's why I decided to ask my friend Durán if he could provide me with some trusted dawi to help manage my lands.\nAnd damn it, every man lost and every pension paid to reclaim the fortress had been worth it. Not only did I get the group of dawi I needed for this kind of work, but I also had the luxury of more dawi than I requested gladly volunteering to work for me… they even fought over the positions. And when the dawi fight for the privilege of serving you, you know you've done something right in life.\nEven so, I only needed six for the moment. I didn't want to flood my administration with dwarfs, as Reinsfeld still had sky-high racism problems, especially with the forced coexistence with the Bretonnians living in these lands.\nI set up a suite of government offices in my old castle, which would now serve as a workplace for the dawi and the new administrators. They would handle all the tedious paperwork, and I would only step in for major matters, such as complex trials or the admission of guilds into my domains.\nHowever, I had much to do: I had spent almost all my gold reserves on reclaiming the farmland of Reinsfeld and, above all, on paying the new migrants in gold coins instead of granting them land. The new gamble was that agriculture in Reinsfeld and the lands of Merxheim—reclaimed from the forest—would serve to feed the Empire.\nI had many ideas to revolutionize Imperial agriculture and, now that I had almost the entire population of Reinsfeld under my labor control, the goal was clear: achieve maximum efficiency using the Norfolk system, industrial fertilizers to shorten cycles, and keep the land producing all year round. Of course… I knew the basics, but that's what Thorek was for, the dawi who had established his people's underground farms, so efficient they produced inside enclosed caverns.\nWith his help, I provided the raw ideas, and he, using his ingenuity and centuries of agricultural experience, guided me in applying them correctly. The goal was for the land never to rest.\n\"So, dawongi… from what I understand, you want a farm system that produces food constantly, with no years where the land has to lie fallow,\" the dawi said, running a hand through his beard.\n\"Exactly, honorable dawi. I will follow all your recommendations for this work. Your duty here is to ensure everything is done according to your great expertise, and that the scholars I've gathered for you help my workers bring your plans to life,\" I replied.\n\"I see… I notice you've already built an irrigation system. A simple but functional construction, by the looks of it… and from what I see, you're installing it in all the fields,\" the dawi observed.\n\"That's right. It was one of my first improvements to increase my city's agricultural production. I wanted my peasants to have easier access to water, reducing the labor of hauling it from the well,\" I answered.\n\"I see… then we should start planting legumes as soon as possible. It's well known that when you plant legumes, they help the growth of the crops that follow,\" the dawi said.\n\"I suppose it has to do with helping the nitrification of the soil, right? Then it would be wise to use my nitrate-based fertilizers so that, at this time of year, the nitrogen settles well in the soil before planting wheat,\" I asked.\n\"Hmmm… we usually use saltpeter in the caves so our mushrooms and crops grow healthy and strong,\" the dawi replied, analyzing my words.\n\"Yes, Master Dawi. My fertilizer is based on saltpeter and ash potash to increase nitrogen absorption in the soil. So, do we plant legumes and then move to wheat?\" I said, trying to understand the process better.\n\"If it's based on saltpeter, there shouldn't be any problems, as that's the dawi system. We should start immediately, because we're a bit late… if I'm not mistaken, we're approaching a dangerous date for the wheat to be ready. If it rains too much, it could affect your harvests, so the sooner the better,\" the dawi concluded.\n\"So it shall be, honorable dawi. Instruct your workers to help the peasants guide their work in the right way,\" I replied, going to fetch the workers.\nThus began the days with thousands of my draft horses and hundreds of heavy plows forged by my smiths. They immediately set about plowing the farmland of Reinsfeld, using all the local village labor for this unified effort.\nWorking toward a common goal proved far more efficient than working separate family plots. Progress was incredibly fast; it took only minutes to leave hectares fully plowed and ready for the next group of peasants to sow the seeds. Clearly, we lacked an automatic seeder, but, being behind schedule on my agricultural plan, I couldn't wait for the most efficient option. We had to take the most direct route: using large amounts of human and animal labor.\nThus, day by day, field by field, all of Reinsfeld's farmland was plowed and sown. And, to keep the massive number of workers from sitting idle, we also began cultivating new lands, building irrigation canals, and expanding agricultural zones. The dawi and his assistants oversaw everything, ensuring the plan was followed to the letter.\nThe same was happening in Merxheim. With the abundant Bretonnian labor available, the work progressed with fewer problems. The Bretonnians worked with such energy that it was a source of pride to watch them.\nIn the following days, with everything already planted, we moved on to less intensive tasks: caring for the plants, inspecting for pests, and clearing weeds that could hinder growth.\n\"So this is your greenhouse…\" said Thorek, examining the structure and looking over the many beehives I had brought from other towns, as well as the flowers now growing.\n\"That's right. Everything here is designed for wheat to grow in the best possible conditions. Most of the other greenhouses are used for planting cotton with Bretonnian labor, but here we make sure to raise the best wheat seeds,\" I replied, leading him inside the building.\n\"Warm,\" was the first thing he said upon entering.\n\"Exactly. As I said, ideal conditions. Look at how beautifully that wheat grows: it has everything it needs… fertilizer, water, light, and controlled temperature. Here we choose the best wheat strains for the next harvests. Look at this,\" I said, taking the head of one of the plants. \"Normally, wheat has twenty grains per head, but this strain, now in its second generation, has thirty-two. Thanks to these ideal conditions, its genetic potential is expressed to the fullest. We'll save these seeds for future use and continue the selection so that this good genetic line can be reproduced in mass later.\"\nThe dawi took a book from a satchel he carried and began writing. \"This is interesting… I like your ideas, dawongi. I might request one of these greenhouses to work with plants we use in the caverns. Of course, it would need to be modified to remove sunlight, but the temperature and water control could be very useful for my work,\" he said, making neat sketches with quick strokes of his hand.\n\"Of course, no problem, honorable dawi… as long as you can later share your research with us. I'd like to start producing mushrooms in the future, so your findings could be of great help to us in the Empire,\" I replied.\n\"I'll see what I can give you. You know, it takes a lot of trial-and-error experiments before something is considered safe to use, dawongi… at least two centuries to make sure everything is correct,\" said the dawi.\n\"Yes… a prudent time frame, honorable dawi,\" I answered, a little deflated, forgetting that for dwarfs two centuries really is a prudent time frame.\nIn the days that followed, I dedicated myself entirely to making sure everything ran smoothly. I visited the borders, inspecting the dawi work on my new river fortifications toward Marienburg. I inspected the dawi tunnels, especially the fortification with Bretonnia, ensuring it was heavily guarded. I oversaw the delivery of more dawi cannons before heading to Drakwald.The most update n0vels are published on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nI made sure my gunsmiths were producing the new muskets adapted to fire the new ammunition, with the speed needed to replace all the weapons in my personal army. I verified that the daily tons of gunpowder kept flowing to the Dawi Kingdom, maintaining those enormous gold reserves that financed my industry.\nIn Merxheim, the influx of trade flooded the city. Now all merchants traveling by river tried to stop there to buy goods and later sell them in Reinsfeld.\nWhen overland trade resumed in force, rumors began circulating again. The Empire was still bogged down in Bretonnia. Bretonnian merchants spoke of les voleurs en bleu, thieves in blue: apparently, some Imperial forces had completely cleared certain areas of Bretonnia, abducting all the inhabitants. It was said they were necromancers, who then raised the captives as dead and added them to their army.\nAs for the campaign, it was at a standstill. The Bretonnian king had all his knights mobilized, and the strong presence of Damsels and Grail Knights had dealt heavy blows to the Imperial nobles, who had begun acting on their own. This showed that the Imperial general had lost cohesion after his earlier defeat, and his forces were quickly dissolving.\nAs for the Empire… the usual. Averland suffered a greenskin attack that entire granaries were destroyed and thousands of heads of cattle were taken. In Middenland, pacified areas ceased to be so, and beastmen reappeared in the forests. Nordland had to face a Norscan raid that burned two villages before being repelled.\nOstland and Ostermark dealt with problems caused by Kislevites who, as almost always, attacked to steal the Imperial harvest from its granaries to make their winters more bearable.\nIn Stirland, rumors spoke of an increase in necromantic activity. According to merchants, many new necromancers had been seen in Sylvania… although that sounded like the usual tale, since there's no reason for a merchant to venture into a place with no towns where everything is cursed.\nBut one of the best pieces of news was that the von Kesselheim had finished their investigation with the witch hunters… and it hadn't gone well for them. Several of their members were burned as heretics, and much of their property in Altdorf was confiscated by order of the Emperor, leaving them only their farmland outside the city.\nThat put them out of the official scope of the witch hunters, leaving them exposed to retaliation for attacking me while I was away. Still, it was best to wait a little longer, because I know how the witch hunter captain of Reinsfeld works: even if someone is released, he rarely takes his eyes off them if he's convinced of their guilt, and many times his instincts have allowed him to catch heretics with patience.\nSo those fools will keep breathing… for now.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

For the first time in years, I could relax, wrapped in all my soft cotton sheets.\n\"I'm a baked cinnamon bun… I never want to get up… Oh no… I need to go to the bathroom… Come on, think, think… think, think… Ah, to hell with it, I'll get up,\" I muttered, still tangled in the sheets as I tried to sit up.\nAfter taking care of the urgent matter, I was about to return to bed to recover all those hours of sleep lost to work, when someone had the audacity to interrupt me.\nSoft knocks sounded on the door, and one of my bodyguards peeked his head in.\n\"My lord, a knight of the Reiksguard has arrived with a message from the Emperor,\" he announced without fully stepping inside.\n\"Is it urgent…?\" I asked, reaching for my sheets. \"…Who am I kidding, it must be urgent if it's from the Emperor,\" I sighed, walking toward my clothes and putting on my elven amulet.\nThe guard left while I dressed, changing my white cotton garments for something more presentable. Once ready, I went down to the hall of my old castle, which I now only used for sleeping.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, envoy of His Imperial Highness,\" I greeted the Reiksguard knight with the comet gesture.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, Graf Albrecht. By the grace of Sigmar's Chosen, your information regarding the rebel province of Marienburg's collaboration in the attack on your lands has been reviewed. The Emperor, after analyzing it, has deemed it a dishonorable act, though not enough to escalate into open war. Therefore, the Chosen of Sigmar authorizes you to act in the name of the Empire to raid three villages of Marienburg and seize two ships from their river routes, along with their cargo and crews as hostages, as compensation for such an affront,\" the knight explained.\n\"I see… So this means… I'm free to choose whether or not to carry out the attacks, or is it an obligation?\" I asked.\n\"The Emperor does not command it, Graf, but it is the honor of the Empire and of our Lord Sigmar that we all must defend. It would be strange for one of His most devoted servants not to attempt to avenge with all his might those who collaborate against the God of Humanity's interests,\" replied the knight.\n\"Uh-huh… I understand,\" I nodded, realizing it wasn't mandatory, but definitely expected. \"I'll see what I can do soon,\" I said with a smile.\n\"I also bring my duty as an honorary messenger of the Cult of Sigmar. The Grand Theogonist has taken note of your aid to Middenland last year, and the Cult of Ulric thanks you for your brave service in the cleansing of Drakwald. The Ar-Ulric invites you to Middenheim to honor your service to the Empire, while the Grand Theogonist invites you to the Cathedral of Sigmar to receive your reward for aiding against the corrupt threat in the forests,\" he added, placing letters and documents on the table in front of me.\n\"I appreciate the consideration of the Imperial cults. Once I have a free moment, I'll gladly accept the invitations of the Grand Theogonist and the High Priest of Ulric,\" I said with a smile, entirely ignoring the fact that there was no way in hell I'd actually go.\nThe knight nodded and left the castle.\nI ran a hand down my face. \"So… this is how it feels, Otto… I understand now why you hate seeing me so much,\" I murmured after a heavy sigh.\n\"Do I have the face of a rabid dog or what? Why can't I have at least one damned year of peace without being forced to go looking for a fight?\" I grumbled to myself. \"This is going to end badly… Marienburg is like a hornet's nest; kick it and they'll go mad, sending mercenary armies to punish you for touching their trade… Alright, let's see what can be done.\"\nI gathered my men and prepared them for what was coming. It wasn't good news, but there was no choice but to comply: it was an imperial order. So, more out of duty than desire, I marched with a force of four thousand soldiers, several dawi organ guns, and three heavy cannons toward the border with the republic, ready to set an example of what happened if anyone dared trouble the Empire. If burning three villages was the only condition, size didn't matter: I'd do it.\nUsing an old trade bridge, we crossed the river quickly. With my cavalry, I picked up the pace until we reached the nearest mercenary camp, the same one I had located on the night we attacked the Bretonnians.\nAs soon as we spotted the tents pitched on the dry ground —one of the few in Marienburg's marshlands— we fell on them like lightning. We fired mercilessly on the surprised mercenaries, a mix of cultures in a single army. They returned fire, but I deflected the bullets with magic and reinforced my men's armor so that the lead shots veered off course.\nWe entered the camp, destroying everything in our path. We kept firing until they ran out of loaded pistols, forcing them to fall back and reload. For a few moments, we stood facing each other, glaring with hostility, while they pulled out bows, crossbows, and primitive-looking muskets.\nThen we began executing caracoles riding in close to fire, then pulling back in circles at a gallop, unloading our pistols again and again. Their projectiles barely grazed us, and I deflected those that could cause trouble.\nAfter several passes, the enemy lines began to break. Many fled into the swamp; others ran down the road, right into the path of the rest of my troops arriving from the rear. We caught them without giving them a chance to breathe. Those who fled down the road were shot in the back until they began to surrender.\nI did not deny them the right to surrender; after all, they were colleagues in the profession, and I would not harshly punish someone who could easily have been me. Once they declared it publicly, I took them prisoner and gave the order to loot the mercenary camp.\nThe camp was almost empty, with only a few mercenaries too drunk to fight. They swayed from side to side, trying to understand what had happened while still dealing with the poor decisions of the night before.\nIt was like a cosmopolitan city: stalls of Estalian, Imperial, Araby, and southern city-state mercenaries. A mix of cultures united by only one thing—the gold of Marienburg.\nGold that was now mine… although, as good men of arms, they had spent almost all of it as quickly as possible. We barely found a few coins, but we did find expensive clothes, large amounts of armor, and weapons from all over.\nThere was also a fair number of representatives of the world's oldest profession… very exotic ones, truth be told. I wouldn't touch them with a stick; to me, those women looked like Nurgle cultists, carrying more on their legs than the very Prince of Excess himself.\nOne of them began speaking in a language I didn't understand, but her intentions were clear when she let her silk garments fall, baring her breasts, and gestured for me to come closer.\n\"Yes… yes, of course…\" I said, while drawing my pistol and shooting her in the chest. \"I'm not going near a whore full of venereal diseases.\" I holstered the weapon and signaled for the women to leave. I didn't want to have to drive them away later if they followed us to the military camp, which was, in all likelihood, their plan.\nWith the only resistance removed, I set course for the nearest Marienburg village. Honestly, this must have been one of the most difficult missions they could have assigned me: with so much mud, it was impossible to use horses, and we were forced to move on foot. Any heavy armor was a hindrance; anyone carrying too much weight sank easily.\nThe cannons were the worst. It took more than twenty men and three horses just to try to get them out of the mud. In the end, I ordered them to return the way we came; it wasn't worth dragging them along like that. We continued with only a reduced group, moving toward the nearby villages and looting two small hamlets. I didn't bother capturing their inhabitants: they were quick, slippery, and fled into the swamps. Besides, having them in my lands would be a problem, as they were too close to their nation—unlike the Bretonnians I kept further from their duchies.\nWhat I thought would take a few hours ended up lasting most of the day. Before the day was done, we marched toward the last Bretonnian village on the list: Erlach. It was the only one of decent size, an important trade point before reaching the Empire, and I had ignored it until then. I decided it had to burn before the rain and mud made things harder.\nWe advanced with all our forces. Fortunately, it was on dry land. We evacuated the population and then set fire to every building, looting the merchants' houses first. We found gold, silver, Tilean silk, and amphorae full of spices. Once everything valuable was in our hands, we left notices warning that the Empire would not tolerate collaboration with Bretonnia for economic interests.\nWe returned covered in mud, dragging the cannons to set them up near the fortifications. We spent the night in a tent, and the next day we went back to Reinsfeld. I placed the guns on the riverbank, waiting for a Marienburg ship to pass without docking in my ports. It couldn't look like a deliberate act within my docks—it was better for it to seem like a legitimate reprisal outside my waters.\nThe first ship flying the Marienburg flag that sailed past received three cannon shots that shattered its hull, sending the crew into panic. Another ship with the same flag was right behind it. Neither was armed, and both were left dead in the water as the projectiles tore holes in their sides, forcing them to dock to avoid sinking.\nLuckily, they didn't try to flee toward Middenland, which would have been a diplomatic headache. With almost my entire personal army waiting, the crews surrendered without resistance.\nThe captain of the first ship came ashore shouting, \"Have you lost your minds, you damned fools?! This means war, you hear me?! War!\"\n\"Go tell your beloved directors, who let Bretonnian troops pass through their territory against the Empire,\" I replied.\nThe second captain answered, \"The House of Roelef will not stand by while Imperial swine try to seize their goods.\"\n\"Yes, I'm aware. Now, stop shouting and put on the shackles,\" I said without much interest.\n\"The Republic's response will be terrible, Imperial dog,\" spat the first.\n\"May Mannan curse your fortune,\" added the other.\nI turned to one of my guards and slid two fingers across my throat. He understood immediately. His greatsword swung once, and two heads rolled onto the dirt.\nIn the looting of the ships, we found Tilean silk, fine liquors, and luxury goods from Araby. \"Yeah… this is going to get ugly,\" I murmured as I looked over the cargo.\nWho the hell advised the Emperor that this was an appropriate response? Why didn't he try diplomacy… or did it mean that the Marienburg Directorate itself gave the order to let them pass and has no scapegoat to easily sacrifice? Or perhaps the Emperor didn't find the response adequate. Those were all the possibilities.\nBut now the problem was mine—I had to be ready to withstand whatever mercenary force came against me.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Finally, an imperial messenger arrived—not with the response I was expecting, but to inform me that the griffon egg I had been promised was about to hatch. He was accompanied by caretakers from the Altdorf Zoo, sent to assist at the exact moment of hatching.\nMeanwhile, I kept a close watch on the border with Marienburg, keeping the Merxheim militias on alert for any attack along the river. At last, the chick broke free from its shell, and from that moment on, I had to keep it with me at all times. I fed it constantly with meat and took care around its beak; even newly hatched, it was sharp enough to take a finger off anyone who moved the wrong way.\nFrom then on, I carried it with me everywhere so I could feed it whenever it was hungry, only leaving it with the caretakers when they needed to check on its health. For weeks, as the tension dragged on, the creature accompanied me alongside my steed, always waiting for the response that would, sooner or later, arrive from the merchant city.\nNearly a month passed before they began to show signs. Across the river, large contingents of mercenaries gathered, camping and waiting for reinforcements. The difference was that the bridge built by the dawi was now complete, with some of its fortifications halfway finished. There were good positions for cannons, and the old bridge they had once used to cross had been destroyed—there was no sense in keeping it and splitting forces to defend two crossings.\nFor days, the mercenary companies remained on the other side of the river, watching us. Eventually, a rider appeared carrying the Marienburg flag. Seeing the clear signal of intent to negotiate, I approached with the Imperial banner.\n\"Representing the interests of the Great Free City of Marienburg and by unanimous decision of the Directorate Council, I come to negotiate with the Imperial representative who has the authority to do so,\" the envoy said.\n\"If you want someone with negotiation authority from the Empire, you'll have to wait a long time,\" I replied, staring at him.\n\"The city of Marienburg and its directors demand an explanation for the erratic actions of the Empire in attacking our mercenaries and merchant vessels,\" the envoy continued.\n\"Retaliation for allowing a group of Bretonnian knights to pass through Fort Bergbres on their way to Reikland with the intent to plunder our lands, while the conflict continued, seeking to profit by selling weapons to both sides,\" I answered without looking away.\n\"Those are nothing but false excuses to justify the attack. Our honorable city has never…\" he began.\n\"Shut your mouth, liar. We have witnesses—captured Bretonnian knights who swore before the Lady that the commander of Fort Bergbres allowed them through. When they were defeated, all their men confirmed the story,\" I interrupted.\nI saw his face tighten and his pupils dilate; he was a trained diplomat, without unnecessary reactions.\n\"Those are nothing but vile Bretonnian lies meant to tarnish our city's name. The Directorate demands compensation of five times the damage caused…\"\nI turned my horse away, denying him the satisfaction of hearing more, and returned to my side of the river. I went back to the fortifications the dawi were still building, while the envoy remained there, motionless, for almost an hour, waiting for attention. Eventually, he returned to his people, and I saw the mercenaries beginning to prepare to advance.\nI gave the order to the artillerymen to get ready and, if possible, to fire without damaging the new bridge. The rest of my forces positioned themselves to block any crossing attempt. On our side, a strong contingent of armored pikemen and numerous musketeers formed up, their weapons a mix of old and new models.\nNot wanting to be the first to fire, I waited for the mercenaries to try crossing the bridge.\nAfter a long wait, a group charged forward. Among them were several ogres—huge and heavy—followed by more mercenaries running to keep pace. Once it was clear they were the aggressors, I gave the order for the heavy cannons to open fire on the formations gathering to take the bridge, while four dawi organ guns fired directly at those attempting to cross.\nWhat followed was a cacophony of screams and thunderous blasts. Within seconds, most of the ogres collapsed on the bridge, and the few mercenaries still standing were trapped among shattered bodies. The stone of the bridge was slick with blood, and many rolled in it, their legs, arms, or bellies torn apart by shrapnel.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nThe heavy pieces from the fortifications had blown huge holes in their ranks. The musketeers began firing immediately, buying time for the artillerymen to reload the organ guns while new groups of mercenaries tried to cross.\nSoon, archers began harassing us from the other side. I decided to use my magic—not as in Bretonnia, where I turned their arrows into harmless clumps—but for something more efficient: diverting each projectile before it could reach my men. A single invisible push was enough to make all the arrows miss and fall far from our positions.\nAs the battle continued, more mercenaries rushed the bridge, but they were met with a constant hail of musket fire and organ gun volleys. Some Imperial mercenaries with firearms tried to return fire, but the weapons they carried were old and inaccurate, missing more shots on their own than because of me.\nThe cannons roared without rest, cutting down dozens every minute. Marienburg had not brought heavy cannons, and their mercenaries had few modern firearms. Perhaps the city could have acquired pieces from Nuln, but either they didn't, or they didn't get Imperial approval—or perhaps, as with most mercenary armies, they rarely carried cannons with them.\nSeveral more groups tried to cross, but the concentrated firepower at that single point made passage practically impossible. In the end, the mercenaries began to fall back. I noticed men wearing the heraldry of a mermaid from the city—probably officers trying to rally them—but it was clear they had lost the will to fight.\nBy the time evening came, everything had gone quiet again. I devoted myself solely to feeding the voracious beast that demanded food constantly.\nBut I doubted very much that this would end with just a simple local skirmish. That's why I immediately began dividing my forces across every possible point where the river could be crossed without the need for a bridge. At least three known areas received reinforcements, deploying organ guns and calling in the militias from Reinsfeld to help cover those crossings, waiting for any movement from Marienburg.\nSince this had practically escalated into a war, there was nothing left to lose. I repositioned the cannons along the river. Marienburg would have few reasons to prolong the conflict if I managed to sink every single ship sailing under its flag.\nThus, for the rest of the day, any Marienburg vessel that appeared on the river—whether in Imperial waters or in those of the merchant city—was bombarded without mercy. Within a few hours, more than a dozen ships lay at the bottom of the Reik; another ten were stranded on sandbanks on our side, and a couple more in Middenland. Their crews were quickly captured and put to work digging trenches, in preparation for a long standoff.\nDuring the night, my artillery kept sinking ships, but by dawn, all of them stayed out of range of our cannons. Only occasionally would a captain try to cross, only to end up stranded or sunk, with his crew taken prisoner and likewise forced to dig defenses in the shallower stretches of the river, while we looted whatever was valuable from their holds.\nShortly afterward, the mercenary army regrouped in front of the bridge and also at different fords along the river, clearly trying to split our attention. Too bad for them I had already anticipated that tactic and had garrisons ready to respond to any crossing.\nThe Marienburg negotiator appeared again on the bridge, but I knew time was on my side. Losing trade revenue was painful, but I wasn't losing everything—I could still sell in Altdorf, and the dawi gold kept flowing. Even running a deficit, I could hold out for months before being forced to negotiate. I doubted they had the same resilience with a large part of their trade blocked.\nSo the negotiator stood there on the bridge, and when he tried to approach closer to shout orders, I gave the instruction to fire at the bridge—without hitting him. I had no interest whatsoever in talking.\nFor days we remained in that constant deadlock: they tried to cross, we repelled them with the firepower of our organ guns, which covered every crossing. River traffic was completely paralyzed; from kilometers away, one could see ships lining up to return to their city.\nIn those days, almost three hundred dawi arrived from the mountains to join my nearly ten thousand men guarding the river. Duran, upon hearing of what happened from his workers, quickly gathered warriors from newly allied clans and sent them to reinforce us. They also brought a freshly forged cannon, which I placed at a strategic crossing. That brought us to four heavy pieces covering the Reik, well-positioned and ready to fire.\nMarienburg kept amassing mercenaries on the opposite bank, but there were no longer massive attempts to cross—only minor skirmishes. However, after three weeks of tension and beginning to feel the financial strain from reduced sales, complaints began arriving from Altdorf: Imperial merchants could not trade in Marienburg, as their ships had been seized in retaliation. The guilds of the capital sent letters threatening to sue me if I didn't lift the blockade.\nEven so, neither Marienburg nor the Emperor seemed to want this to escalate into a full-scale war. It was a matter of seeing who would yield first.\nMeanwhile, the dawi continued building fortifications. Every possible crossing now had basic defenses: small walled towers, quick to build but able to house fifty men. Though simple, they were enough to stop mercenaries who had already lost all previous skirmishes. No one wanted to be the next victim of our shrapnel.\nThe calm broke when Marienburg attempted a coordinated attack: several simultaneous offensives against all crossings and an attempt to break the river blockade using cannons mounted on their ships.\n''But Sigmar seemed to be on our side'' the first shot from one of our cannons struck the enemy ship's powder store, causing an explosion that set two more ships ablaze, as their own powder stores detonated when the same red-hot cannonball hit them as well. Within seconds, the river was filled with bodies and burning wreckage.\nOn land, the crossings failed completely. The power of the organ guns was devastating; even the ogres who tried to force the bridge were cut down before reaching the halfway point. The bridge itself held without issue, protected by the heaviest concentration of artillery.\nAfter this defeat, the Marienburg negotiator returned to the bridge with his flag, and this time I agreed to speak. The truth was, with revenues reduced by nearly half, I wasn't sure I could sustain the situation much longer without cutting back on construction expenses.\nHe requested the presence of an Imperial ambassador. We sent a ship to Altdorf, and two days later it returned with the envoy. Negotiations began between them, and although I don't know exactly what was agreed upon, by the end of the day the mercenaries began to withdraw. The ambassador conveyed the order to once again allow Marienburg ships to pass along the Reik.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

No… I have more right than anyone to know why I had to go toe-to-toe with Marienburg's mercenary armies,\" I said, locking my gaze on him.\n\"All of this happened because of your lack of tact, Graf. When my counterpart presented himself to you, he asked to speak to a diplomat with negotiation authority, correct? But that message never made it to Altdorf… you simply slammed the door in Marienburg's face, and they clearly didn't take it well. You forced them to attack you, ruining the imperial plan. You're lucky it all turned out well,\" the ambassador said, trying not to avert his eyes.\n\"Oh… so you dragged me into politics and didn't tell me. That sounds more like incompetence from whoever planned the whole thing. If a 'plan' isn't communicated to the one who has to carry it out, these things happen… and as you say, it falls apart. Or do you think that with no information whatsoever I'd just sit quietly, watching an army march into my lands demanding compensation?\" I replied, slowly walking toward him.\n\"This was the Emperor's plan. Are you saying it's a stupid plan? I think it's stupider to strike first,\" he shot back, though his voice dropped half a tone.\n\"Stupider will be the one who falls off his horse on the way back, ambassador… don't you think?\" I said, getting close enough for him to feel my shadow looming over him.\n\"Is… is that a threat?\" he asked, swallowing hard.\n\"A warning. I've seen many people fall off a horse and never get up again,\" I answered, stepping behind him and placing a heavy hand on his shoulder. \"So tell me what was negotiated. I don't like being left in the dark, especially when I had to move a large part of my forces to stop the merchants from doing something that could harm us.\"\n\"As I said… this escalated because of you and—\"\n\"I didn't ask you that,\" I cut him off, tightening my grip on his shoulder.\n\"This was all part of a plan to make Marienburg understand that their scheme with the Bretonnians had been exposed. By negotiating, we could obtain… well, we still don't know who authorized the passage of troops through Marienburg's fortress, but that affects their position and reputation. The Emperor hoped to secure a low-interest loan to hand out generous gifts to the electors, so they would 'choose wisely' in the next election of the chosen,\" he explained, trying to keep calm.\n\"All this… for a loan? The Emperor set up this whole conflict just to get a loan?\" I asked in disbelief.\n\"That loan included payment for your services, Graf. And… everything blew up because we didn't inform you of the plan. We didn't think you would act so brusquely with Marienburg's envoy, much less that you would defeat their mercenary army so easily… and even less that you'd blockade the Reik,\" the ambassador said, forcing a half-smile.\n\"Of course, because I couldn't beat Marienburg in economic terms on my own, so the most sensible thing was to show them the conflict would hurt them much more than me,\" I replied, crossing my arms.\n\"And it worked,\" he admitted. \"Brutes like you, with good tactical sense, make my job easier… since I can make it clear that it's either negotiating with me or with you, who clearly has no diplomatic skill.\"\n\"Because I won,\" I replied. \"I kicked their asses twice and destroyed three of their ships… and I hardly took any casualties. That's a full victory. Rarely does the victor bow before the defeated.\"\n\"Well, it wasn't a total victory… but it was a partial one,\" the ambassador said, swirling the wine in his glass. \"Marienburg could easily mobilize thousands, even hundreds of thousands of mercenaries, if given enough time for all their gold to circulate through the cities that usually supply them with troops. So this victory is temporary… but it puts us in a strong position to negotiate.\"\n\"And… what did you negotiate? Because something tells me you didn't close the loan,\" I asked, staring at him.\n\"Ah… at least you're not blind,\" he answered with a barely concealed smirk. \"Marienburg wanted you punished for your offense, but the Emperor won't sanction a loyal servant. And don't worry about the lawsuits in Altdorf; it's already been made clear to the judges that they must be dismissed immediately. Instead of a loan, we agreed on a payment to get trade flowing again and the release of all prisoners in our custody. In exchange, the Emperor will receive compensation of three million crowns for the 'minor issue' of the Bretonnian passage, plus an annual payment of half a million for five years, to guarantee good relations.\"\n\"So you squeezed them dry,\" I said without looking away.\n\"That's right… and forgive me for not including you in the negotiations. They didn't even want you present; you know, they see you as a brute, and your presence could have made these delicate circumstances worse,\" the ambassador said, raising his glass.\n\"Alright… and how much is my share then?\" I said, taking a few steps around the newly finished hall of the fortification.\n\"Considering the problems that arose… do you think you should get anything, Graf?\" the ambassador replied.\n\"I get the feeling you're begging to get lost in a forest full of beastmen, with your hands and legs broken, aren't you?\" I said, stopping in front of him.\nThe ambassador sighed. \"It's not fun talking to you… why does everything have to turn into a death threat? It's just a way to guide the conversation.\"\n\"I know that perfectly well,\" I replied, stepping closer. \"But I prefer my own way… it works very well with cowardly leeches like you. And it might… just happen… that if you keep trying to make a fool of me, this interaction could end in a way you won't like.\"\n\"It's still under determination… what was agreed upon was beyond what my counterpart was authorized to grant. It needs formal approval from the board. The cessation of hostilities is already clear; Marienburg loses a lot without trade with the Empire. They'll probably pay. When they do, your share will be decided.\"\n\"We should have maintained the blockade. That would have pushed them more to send the gold,\" I replied.\n\"Again… just because it affects them doesn't mean it doesn't affect Altdorf. Merchants and artisans were already complaining about the lack of supplies. This was supposed to be a short conflict,\" said the ambassador.\n\"And it was,\" I replied.\n\"But we can't keep dragging it on. No one wants a fight this long, Graf… so, I know it's difficult for you, but please don't do anything. Wait for it to be resolved through diplomatic channels,\" insisted the ambassador.\n\"Fine by me… I'll make sure to clean the bridge well from blood-stained rocks and rivers full of bodies, so that when peace returns we won't have trouble with corpses rising among us,\" I replied.\n\"Very well, do that… and tell my guards to stay closer to me, please. I don't want more problems like this,\" said the ambassador, pouring himself more wine.\nI left the half-built fortification by the dawi and informed the dwarf auxiliary force that the fight was over, thanking them for their service and assuring them they would be compensated in whatever way they deemed appropriate, which Durán would determine later.\nIn the following days, seeing that the danger had greatly diminished, I ordered the militias back to their posts. Surveillance in my cities had dropped too much: with three thousand militiamen in the dawi tunnels and five thousand with me, only two thousand men were left to guard more than a hundred thousand souls—a huge challenge.\nI took the time to, along with Thorek, inspect the wheat fields. Our granaries were full of legumes, one of the most abundant harvests in memory, thanks to a skilled dawi who micromanaged each crop.\nDuring my absence, my dwarf council had proposed something interesting: to prevent tensions between the mountain clans and my domains from worsening, a special position would be created for another dawi, tasked with informing me of all grievances committed by my subjects against the clans and mediating to resolve them quickly, thus avoiding their entry into the Dammaz Kron. I thought it was an excellent idea. Before, I had to deal with such problems myself, but now a group of dwarfs and my own men would mediate and resolve the minor disputes arising from this new friendship.\nSince some clans had started sending members to my cities to purchase trade licenses, we would soon have many dawi merchants supplying the growing mountain domain, which was expanding daily and needed a constant flow of supplies to sustain its growth. Everything arrived just in time for my abundant harvests to fill their granaries.\nHaving such a good relationship with the local dawi thane made it very easy for me to secure agreements that would normally require paying huge amounts of gold or materials. Durán was always the first to speak to allied clans on my behalf, seeking the most peaceful coexistence possible. For now, we both needed each other: I depended on the dwarfs because they opened the doors to their markets, and they depended on me for the military and economic support I was providing. It was a very convenient relationship for both.\nAfter reviewing some local matters—including a trial against some alleged cultists who turned out to be merely devout followers of Taal, mistaken for their forest rituals—I returned to guard my bridge with Marienburg for several days, until finally the diplomat returned accompanied by Marienburg ships.\nThis time, they did let me into the meeting room. The negotiations would be held in my bridge fortress, and it would have been strange to exclude me. Marienburg agreed to pay the annual tribute… though only half. They agreed to deliver two million crowns to end the conflict, and what followed was probably the most tedious thing I have ever witnessed: diplomats talking endlessly about why they deserved more or should pay less, depending on their positions and \"prior commitments.\"\nSeveral times, the ambassador gestured toward me, and I barely reacted, almost dozing off. Each time he did, the Marienburg diplomat pressed his lips together. After endless hours, they agreed on a payment of two and a half million crowns, plus four hundred thousand crowns annually for the Emperor for five years.\nOnce the deal was sealed, they began drinking wine and chatting like old friends, almost ignoring that, not long ago, thousands of mercenaries and some Imperials had died in this very place on blood-soaked battlefields.\n'So this must be how soldiers feel when diplomatic agreements close without acknowledging their merits,' I thought, watching them celebrate the end of hostilities.\nAfter that, Marienburg ships stopped at Merxheim and began unloading part of the compensation for the \"misunderstanding.\" They left me half a million Imperial crowns for my services, and the Emperor granted me an annual income of one hundred thousand crowns for the next five years.\nI also received a formal invitation to the capital for having \"financed\" the Bretonnian campaign with enough gold to cover several months of operations. Apparently, the gold gifts for the electors are not mere gestures of courtesy, but resources meant to mobilize men for the Imperial offensive into Bretonnian territory and secure the election. The Emperor may be a son of a bitch, but he's not stupid.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------\nI translated this chapter with ChatGPT because, for some reason, I wrote it in Spanish instead of English and didn't have the time to do it by hand",

On top of that, I was invited to yet another party with the Emperor. I had to go to Altdorf to celebrate the fact that I'd secured him enormous amounts of gold to finance the campaign in Bretonnia, which he would skillfully use to buy his son the Emperor's throne.\nBut one thing certainly caught my attention… all of this was for one thing: a loan… a damn loan that made the Emperor move his pieces and unleash me like a dog on a defenseless prey to get financial gain. So the banking business must be profitable.\nClearly, I had no idea, since unlike my father I had never taken out a loan. Risking money that wasn't mine was something I was never willing to do; I didn't even want to think about how abusive the interest rates might be, since I couldn't remember ever reading about limitations on such percentages.\nBut if a war nearly broke out over securing lower interest rates, I have to imagine that a bank's profits must be immense.\nAnd that, honestly, left me thinking for a long time whether I should open a bank or continue with my idea of controlling the entire local market so no one could challenge my influence in the city… because, in a way, if I started issuing local loans I'd be helping my subjects grow or improve, which could easily make them less dependent on me.The source of thɪs content is N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nBut earning gold simply for lending it was tempting. On several occasions, like now, I had far more gold than I would spend in a year, and it would just sit there doing nothing while I waited to use it for labor or resources needed to keep expanding my cities.\nSo I didn't hesitate much before calling a friend to discuss business.\n\"Duran, thank you so much for coming on such sh....hurried notice. I know you must be very busy with everything going on in your karak now that hundreds or thousands of dawi arrive every month to seek their fortunes in the domains of your clan,\" I said to Duran, who had come as soon as he received the message for a meeting in my laboratory.\n\"Not at all, dawongi. Tell me, what do you need me for?\" asked the kindly dawi, shaking my hand.\n\"I intend to open a bank in Reinsfeld, since it seems the local lending market is quite lucrative. And well, every bank must be a masterpiece of security. I can't think of anyone better than a dawi to build such a work, so I need your best workers and runesmiths to construct it. Well… actually two: one in Reinsfeld and another in Merxheim, since that's where all the monetary movement happens,\" I told the dawi, who began stroking his beard, which seemed to be growing thicker.\n\"I'm glad we were the first ones you thought of, dawongi… of course we can take on that job. You tell us where you want it built, and I'll mobilize all the available runesmiths from the clans under my protection. We'll complete what you ask as soon as possible,\" said Duran with confidence.\n\"I'm glad to hear that… I was thinking of building it on the south side of my old castle, since that area is still not urbanized and is used as pastureland for the cows usually slaughtered for my meals. So I can easily move them and make sure everything's fine. The one in Merxheim should be as close to the river as possible to catch the merchants' eye,\" I told Duran.\n\"Alright, I'll send my engineers to make the necessary calculations for the runic vaults so your entire fortune is secured in those locations,\" said Duran.\nMeanwhile, I had to prepare to go to Altdorf, as once again I had to make an appearance at those damn capital parties. With my whole escort ready, we took a boat to Altdorf and I stayed in my city residence, occasionally trying to find out what had happened with the Kesselheim family.\nTalking to the local witch hunters, who didn't look at me suspiciously once they found out who I was, it seemed my magical items distracted them enough.\nThe reason the Kesselheims had been punished was that they owned many magical items that weren't registered anywhere and couldn't explain where they had come from. That's why the witch hunters' theory that the Kesselheims had a secret wizard gained so much traction.\nMeanwhile, the magisters from the Colleges said they could only determine it was the work of a very powerful wizard… or a group of wizards. So, even though the magisters tried to clear their colleagues' name, it was heavily tarnished in the eyes of the Cult of Sigmar. In this case, the idea that there was an uncertified wizard so close to Altdorf, or even several unknown wizards, was one of the worst pieces of news the Colleges could receive, as it meant they had failed in their mission to detect hidden wizards in the city.\nThat's why they were punished so severely, since every magical item must be registered or inspected by priests. My elven amulet must remain an absolute secret so I don't become the next target, because if they were punished so harshly over a wizard that never existed, I don't want to imagine what would happen if they discovered I am actually a wizard and, worse still, that I've used Sigmar's name falsely. Burning me would be the least of it.\nI took the opportunity to move about the city, now more confident in my own magical control, though I stayed away from the north side, where all the Colleges of Magic are. In the south side I could move freely, and it was there that I ran into the group of Verena's judges, the same ones who had accepted thousands of crowns in bribes. I saw them while strolling near the palaces of justice, where they had publicly executed several peasants for theft. I had to attend some trials so the lawsuits filed against me by certain artisans and guilds as a result of the trade blockade would be dismissed.\nWith those matters settled, I had to attend yet another of the Emperor's parties. To my headache, there were more nobles than ever, including several electors. The Emperor had probably already sweet-talked them with his gold to secure their support in gathering men for the Bretonnian war effort.\nThree reception halls had been arranged simultaneously to host different Imperial political groups, since some electors had grudges and could not even stand each other. I was assigned to the hall where numerous Sigmarite nobles from Reikland, Averland, and Wissenland gathered. Luckily, with so many important figures present, not all attention was focused on me.\n\"Then, Graf… it would be a great honor for my family if you could attend this event,\" said one of the many nobles still trying to flatter me.\n\"I'm busy. I have many things to do—unfortunately, I won't be able to attend,\" I replied, looking away and thinking about how to rid myself of this group of sycophants.\n\"Honorable Graf, I would be honored if you accompanied me to the next dance,\" said a young lady, curtseying and lifting her dress slightly.\n\"Do you think I can dance wearing all this steel, my lady?\" I answered, showing her my gauntleted hands.\n\"Graf Albrecht, I'd like to speak with you about some of your dyes… my family owns dye works, and we would be more than happy to receive your pigments to adorn the clothing of the court nobles,\" another noble interjected, approaching patiently.\n\"And how much do I get out of it?\" I asked, fixing my gaze on him.\n\"If you supply us with the dyes, we can offer you thirty percent of the profits,\" replied the noble with a confident smile.\n\"No… that's not economically viable. It's easier to just buy the shop from an artisan than to do that,\" I replied after making the mental calculations.\nThis went on for several minutes, until I noticed a strong escort approaching, pushing aside all the flattering nobles and surrounding my own guards. Among them, a flamboyant noble made his way forward, smiling at me.\n\"Greetings, Graf Albrecht… I am Konstantin von Liebwitz,\" he said, firmly shaking my gauntleted hand.\n\"The Elector Count of Wissenland… to what do I owe the honor?\" I replied, looking him in the eye.\n\"Oh, I see you know me, I'm glad. As you may know, the Emperor has granted me the authority to chair the commission that will decide the next model of firearm to be used in the State regiments. And I know very well that you possess a small but steady production of arms, as well as good relations with our Dwarf allies. So it would be prudent of me to cordially invite you to this event to be held in Nuln,\" said the Elector Count.\n\"So you need me to send weapons to be tested?\" I asked.\n\"Indeed, Graf. Consider that I would be delighted for your weaponry to become the Imperial standard. I've heard your muskets are among the best… some nobles from Middeland spoke wonders of their effectiveness against the beastmen. I would be very pleased to receive some samples to study at the University of Nuln,\" the Elector Count replied enthusiastically.\n\"Certainly, being the Empire's arms supplier sounds tempting… but wouldn't it also be your goal, Elector Count, to select your own industry's production as the winner of the event?\" I questioned.\n\"What kind of man would I be if I denied the best gunsmith the opportunity to earn the prestige and honor of supplying the finest weapon to the Empire? Denying technological progress would be unworthy of my position at the University of Nuln,\" he assured me, visibly excited.\n\"I'm glad to hear that, but I regret to say I have none of my weapons at hand. My personal guard doesn't use them, and I'd need time to send you one as a gift. Besides, I'm changing the model to a better one and plan to head to Drakwald again, so I need everything I have,\" I replied.\n\"Oh… so improvements, then. Could you explain what this new improvement consists of? It would help me get a mental picture of your creation,\" he asked with interest.\n\"I don't know the technical concept of my weapons, Elector Count Konstantin. I only know how to use them in combat, not make them. I'm afraid I can't give you more details,\" I answered, keeping my weapon secrets to myself.\n\"Oh… I see,\" said the noble with a slight look of disappointment, until someone behind him caught his attention. \"My apologies… Graf Albrecht, allow me to introduce my daughter, Emmanuelle von Liebwitz, and my son, Leos von Liebwitz,\" he added, pointing to a young girl in extravagant clothes—probably at exorbitant cost—and to a… boy?\nHe had no Adam's apple. Maybe due to his age, but his appearance was far too androgynous for a male.\nPerhaps… could he be corrupted by some cult of Slaanesh?\n\"Is something wrong, Graf?\" the Count asked.\n\"Nothing… I was just remembering past battles,\" I replied.\n\"Ah yes, your fight with Marienburg. I would like to hear details about the Republic's firearms,\" said the Elector Count, regaining his smile.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I had expected this to be delivered somewhere else, but it was better to receive it now than to wait months for a more \"appropriate\" moment.\nUpon entering my property, I opened the chest and saw the promised runic armor… but something about it was different. It wasn't steel. Even without using magic to confirm it, I could now sense the difference: I believed this was gromril. And considering it likely had a better rune than my old one, it was probably true—gromril being the best metal for rune work, according to the dawi.\nWhen I touched it, I noticed it weighed almost nothing—just like my chainmail—bearing the same kind of rune that reduced its weight through rune magic. So, one of the three runes on this armor was the weight-reduction rune; the other two remained a mystery.\nAfter swapping my steel armor for this one, I felt much lighter and more agile. For some reason, it fit me almost perfectly—just a little large, which was good, as it could be adjusted if I grew. I wasn't sure if I could use my magic to work a new ingot of the metal to adapt it; I'd never tried manipulating runic objects with my magic. That would require more study—or perhaps asking my master if he knew anything.\nIn recent days, I'd had multiple meetings with the Elector Count of Wissenland, who was very interested in acquiring my weapon designs. He had invited me several times to his residence in Altdorf for meals, though the conversation often drifted toward my firearms or dawi firearms I might be able to supply.\nI was more tense than ever, unsure if there was some cult conspiracy afoot. His son made my skin crawl—I suspected he might be linked to Slaanesh—but I couldn't use my magic in the city to gather proof. That would only get me burned.\nSo I simply attended, remained calm, smiled, and promised that as soon as I had a weapon ready, I would send it as a gift. That was, of course, a lie—there was no way I'd hand over my work or my subjects' research for free.\nBut that wasn't all. Once again, the Arch Lector of Reikland came to fetch me from my residence to bring me to the damned Cathedral of Sigmar. If there was ever a moment I felt genuine fear, it was then—surrounded by priests and fanatical witch hunters, all for an event in which they congratulated me for my performance in the Drakwald last year and for serving Sigmar so faithfully.\nLuckily, the Grand Theogonist was in Stirland, investigating with a group of the best warrior-priests and witch hunters the high necromantic presence in Sylvania.\nSo they simply gave me the public thanks and offered financial assistance for future projects involving churches, witch hunter barracks, or plans to improve the living standards of my towns' population, along with sanctified purity seals.\nI left that place as quickly as I could.\nI only had to attend one last party at the Imperial Palace, and then it would all be over—after which I could flee the city as fast as possible. This time there were fewer nobles; no minor nobility, as most of the high nobility filled this hall, though there were also representatives from nearly every province. This was surely the moment the Emperor would request support for the Bretonnian campaign.\nFor the first time at one of these banquets, I was truly alone—completely alone. I should have been the one groveling, but I welcomed this unexpected peace at one of these damned events.\nSeveral minutes passed as I enjoyed the food—which others had already tasted to ensure it wasn't poisoned—and watched the musicians and dancing, for once not surrounded by flatterers.\nThe calm ended when someone rather tall approached me. I recognized him instantly as the Elector Count of Middenheim—not just for his height, but for his clothing, a very deep black.\nI set down what I was holding and prepared for the interaction.\n\"Graf Albrecht, isn't it?\" the elector asked.\n\"That's right, Elector Count Boris Todbringer… to what do I owe this honor?\" I said with a smile.\n\"I was curious to meet the noble who venerates one of the Empire's heroes… and who has done so much to cleanse the Drakwald. I must say, that look—wearing armor to an Emperor's banquet—surprises me… I think it does justice to your prestige as a warrior,\" said the Elector Count, eyeing the runes on my gromril armor.\n\"Well, here I am… so tell me, what's the purpose of this conversation?\" I asked with a measured smile.\n\"I wanted to ask if you plan to launch another offensive in the Drakwald this year, whether by order of the Cult of the Empire's Hero, Sigmar, or on your own initiative. If so, I think there's something we could discuss between the two of us,\" said the Elector Count.\n\"Well, I do indeed have another campaign in the Drakwald planned, since I felt the last one was more of a defeat than a victory. I lacked cannons… but now things are different. My goal is to leave the forests spotless, if possible,\" I said, my gauntlet audibly creaking.\n\"Ah… then we do have something to discuss, since your previous cleansing is still evident in the reduced number of beastmen in the Carroburg area. But I would like to request that your next campaign be carried out near Middenheim, clearing the forests along the trade route to Marienburg,\" said the Elector Count.\n\"Well… that's complicated. Very complicated, honestly. It would put me far from my logistical lines, making them vulnerable to beastman ambushes. I'll be using a lot of gunpowder for the clearing, and being so far away, if I take losses, reinforcements would take too long to arrive. I'm afraid it's impossible for me,\" I replied after giving it some thought.\n\"I can offer to have my men escort your caravans, as well as pay you for every beastman head you claim to have taken,\" said the Elector Count.\n\"In that case, it could be feasible… but I could sweeten the deal if you interceded with the Middenland nobility to secure me recruitment permits in the area. Bringing men from Reikland will be difficult, so it would be convenient to recruit locally and train them quickly there. Of course, with the compensation that, in the future, that soldier's family chooses to remain with me. I'll provide financial compensation to that family for their loss, if there's no problem,\" I suggested.Googlᴇ search ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\n\"There could be issues with that, but if I speak to the Ar-Ulric about this matter, I think that if he requests it, there will be no objection to you recruiting loyal Ulricans into your armies… as long as they commit to killing a decent number of beastmen,\" the Elector Count stated.\n\"And what would that decent number be?\" I asked.\n\"If you can repeat last year's successes near Middenheim, you can count on the full support of my nobles and recruit in all the towns under my rule, as long as it's not excessive. I'll also ensure you can do so throughout all of Middenland,\" replied the Elector Count.\n\"In that case, we have a deal, Elector Count Boris… I'll probably be departing next week for Middenheim to begin preparations, as I'll have to move tons of gunpowder and all my available cannons to the area,\" I said with a smile, extending my hand.\nThe Elector Count shook it firmly. \"May Ulric bless this agreement, Graf… with some luck, we can pacify those filthy beasts,\" he said.\nThe conversation continued even as several nobles from the region joined in, interested in my proposal for this year. It seemed many were rallying to the idea, just like the previous year, when the local nobility had been forced to unite out of fear of collapsing under the great tide of beastmen. But now it wasn't just a matter of necessity—dukes, grafs, and barons were committing men and resources to the forest-clearing effort.\nIn barely an hour of discussions, many nobles had pledged almost fifteen thousand men in total. We would gather in Middenheim to launch a general cleansing, with the additional contribution of supplies: medicines and potions from the local cults of Shallya, food, and the freedom to recruit in their villages, as long as I guaranteed clearing an area near their lands of beastman presence. Everything pointed to this hunt being one of the largest of the era.\nThus, the conversation went on, coordinating where we would begin the hunt and how we would move, until the Emperor finally made his appearance.\nAlmost everyone went to greet him. The Emperor surrounded himself with the Electors, and the discussions began while I quietly kept to the shadows.\nThe talks among the nobles went on for hours, dragging on as the sun went down. Finally, the music ceased, and all eyes turned toward the Emperor.\n\"Subjects of the Empire… I am pleased to inform you that today we have reached one of the most important agreements in the history of the Empire founded by our lord Sigmar, creator of this great and eternal Empire! With the express will of the Electors, the State of Bretonnia will soon come to an end. In three years, state armies from all provinces will march into Bretonnia to deliver the final blow necessary to ensure it ceases to exist,\" the Emperor announced to the gathered nobles.\n\"By Imperial order and with the consent of all the Electors, every noble of the Empire is instructed to prepare his men to serve in the state regiments that will take part in the great campaign, which will demonstrate the unity of the Empire. This campaign will prove that the Empire is the strongest human state ever created, ending Bretonnia's existence and integrating it into the Empire of the God of Humanity… a great step toward uniting all humanity under one banner,\" the monarch continued.\n\"Gather brave men, train them, and stockpile weapons. The great campaign will begin soon and, when the time comes, the entire Empire will march as one into Bretonnia, forming one of the largest armies since the days of our great Emperor Magnus the Pious,\" he concluded. Immediately, all the nobles raised their goblets to toast the occasion.\nWine began to flow as hundreds of servants entered the hall. That's when I clearly noticed how luxurious gifts passed discreetly from the Emperor's hands to those of the Electors.\nPolitics.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

This time, I traveled much heavier than the last, for there were far too many cannons to move, and Middenheim was far removed from my comfort zone. I had no choice but to gather hundreds of extra horses to transport the cannons and all the necessary supplies, since this time the supply line would not be just a day away from my home, but four or five full days until reaching Middenheim.\nFor that reason, I had to march with as much weight as possible, carrying enough provisions to establish a camp capable of enduring for as long as the beast hunt lasted. For two whole days supplies were loaded: food, salt, gunpowder, many newly made firearms, dawi cannons, hundreds of spare suits of armor, and—most importantly—a vast cache of Shallya's potions. This time the cleansing would be thorough… and I would see it done properly.\nSo, as soon as it was feasible, we began the march toward Middenheim. We repeated the same path as before, though in Schilderheim it was difficult to find someone willing to charter ships for my transport; many regarded me with suspicion, and the city itself looked run down. In the end, only one merchant eager to fill his purse with gold agreed to take me north, into Middenland.\nThat delay cost us nearly a day, but soon we were back on the road, bound for what would be a grand military campaign.\nIn Carroburg I was received by the local Elector Count, who had already been informed by the Ar-Ulric that I could recruit men from his city and the nearby villages. He raised no objections; rather, he allowed it as a form of thanks for the previous cleansing, which had reduced the problems caused by the beastmen.\nIn that region I recruited about four hundred young men eager to serve under my banner. They were immediately issued old muskets, blue uniforms, full packs, and light armor to cover their most vital parts.\nLater, in Kutenholz, I recruited another two hundred. The routine repeated itself: encamp, drill them in the basics of the musket, teach them to reload, and enforce discipline.\nIn the trio of villages—Brockel, Guthugel, and Kupfengrube—we managed to raise five hundred more, swelling our ranks even further. The local nobility, though suspicious at first, were satisfied when they heard my mission was to hunt beasts. To them, it was far better to give up dozens of sons to the army than to lose entire villages to the monsters.\nIn Mittelweg and Derbez I recruited two hundred each. Altogether, we reached fifteen hundred new recruits marching under my command. After that last stop, the march led straight to Middenheim.\nThere, the Elector Count himself awaited us, along with several nobles who had joined the cleansing campaign. The Ulricans had amassed an enormous quantity of supplies to stave off hardship: food, medicine, weapons, and further reinforcements. Before beginning, I recruited an additional five hundred Ulricans in Middenheim itself, bringing the total to two thousand musketeers—not counting my veteran troops.\n\"Then, Graf Albrecht, where should we begin this hunt?\" asked the Elector Count of Middenheim, pointing to a map of possible areas to cleanse.\nMy finger fell at once on the ideal point. \"Issenbutel… it is the best site for the cleansing. In this way we cover a large portion of the Drakwald and prevent massive beast migrations that could devastate larger towns. We cannot defend every village, so I recommend evacuating the surrounding areas. I know the harvest is near, but this is necessary to avoid heavy casualties,\" I said firmly, while all the nobles studied me.\n\"If you deem it necessary, I will evacuate my peasants to secure positions. Could they be quartered temporarily in Middenheim?\" asked a local noble.\n\"Yes… I will see to it that our brothers in faith are kept safe,\" replied Boris Todbringer.\n\"Good. That said, I also believe the village itself should be evacuated. Attacks will come from all directions, and it would be prudent to leave it empty. We cannot scatter ourselves; we must concentrate in one place, build fortifications, dig trenches, place artillery batteries, and create kill zones,\" I explained, pointing to a hill near a lake as the most suitable site.\n\"So it shall be… but what is a kill zone? It sounds like sorcery… do you have wizards?\" asked another noble suspiciously.\n\"No. It's the term for an area where two lines of fire converge on the same enemy group. Where our fire concentrates, nothing survives,\" I replied.\n\"Ah, I see,\" said the noble, smiling in relief.\n\"Very well then… someone must lead the operation without disputes of command. To avoid conflicts of interest, are there any objections if I take that role?\" I asked.\nAll the nobles turned toward the Elector Count of Middenheim. \"I will not deny that right to the expert hunter. You know more than anyone about the beastmen. For now, I accept your leadership, young Graf. Prove your worth in the eyes of Ulric,\" declared the Elector Count.\n\"So it shall be. We must move quickly. You will see more beastmen than you have ever imagined in your lives,\" I replied.\nWith that, we marched south with more than twenty thousand souls prepared for the great hunt.\nThe next day we reached the chosen village, which lay along one of Middenheim's trade routes to Marienburg, vital to keeping mercantile flow secure.\nAfter ordering the evacuation of villages near Middenheim, the hard work of fortification began. The local lord's castle was useless: it was too closely hemmed in by houses, and half the town would have to be torn down to use it. Instead, the hill near the lake was perfect. There we began digging trenches, raising wooden walls, and felling forests to clear the ground. Little by little, the wooden fortress took shape, ready to house our troops and withstand what was to come.\nOver two relatively quiet weeks, what had once been nearly pristine forest became a gigantic timber fortification. Multiple firing positions rose, walls bristled with well-placed cannons, and warehouses brimmed with hundreds of potions ready for the musketeers' use.\nThe forests had been pushed back several kilometers, and beastmen attacks were few during the construction. The fortress was incredibly defensible, with several inner walls, overlapping kill zones, and artillery deployed with care. If it had been built of stone and given more time, it would surely have been nearly impregnable, modeled after the Italian trace. We had even diverted part of the nearby lake to fill defensive moats, leaving only a single possible entrance to the fortress.\nWhen everything was mostly ready, we began preparing the traps to lure the beastmen. Dozens of pigs were slaughtered and hung from the trees, writhing in agony as their fresh blood dripped onto the earth. It only took a few minutes before the first beastmen appeared in the clearings.\nThey wasted no time in throwing themselves at us, and immediately the muskets thundered without rest. With warehouses full of supplies, tons of gunpowder and lead, the great cleansing had begun.\nOn the first day, we played aggressively: I myself, accompanied by much of my forces and several nobles, led a bold attack alongside a group of Ulrican priests against a herdstone. We quickly overran the few hundred beastmen that guarded it, and the priests performed the rite of purification, burning the stone after offering prayers to Ulric. The dense sense of Dhar in the air confirmed the wisdom of the plan. Before, it had taken us two weeks to destroy one stone; this time, we achieved it on the very first day.\nUpon returning to the fortress, we witnessed a great migration of beasts, drawn by the magical disturbance.\nOn the third day, a massive war herd crashed against our defenses. Thousands of ungors hurled themselves with suicidal fury against the fortification, only to be cut down like wheat under the fire of the organ guns. The cannons roared, and hundreds fell in seconds. Meanwhile, the muskets boomed without pause. The newly recruited Ulricans were nervous at first, but soon grew accustomed—especially when they realized they had the best fields of fire they could have ever imagined.\nDays passed, and with them mountains of corpses piled before our defenses. There were days when thousands died in a single battle, leaving entire fields covered in shrapnel and torn flesh. The priests of Ulric could not keep up with the purifications; the slaughter was so constant that the cult sent dozens more clerics to maintain the rites.\nWhen the beastmen did not attack, we used the time to restock ammunition, repair and extend fortifications, dig new trenches, and secure the passage of supply caravans. Every day was a routine of blood and steel: attack their herdstones, destroy them, and draw more beasts into our killing trap.\nThe enemy losses were colossal. We had purified more than eight stones in the first week alone, exterminating thousands of corrupted females and humans. The south was practically clean, from Bashdal to the east.\nThe following week, we shifted the offensive north while another horde gathered in the south. We cleansed the forests of Fintel, destroying ten more ritual stones in a short span. Many of the gor warriors had already perished in previous assaults, leaving only the weak to guard the breeders.\nEverything was going splendidly. Our own casualties were minimal, and enemy concentrations fell one after another. Even charges of minotaurs and war-gors clad in armor consecrated to the ruinous powers were useless: with so much concentrated fire, no charge made it within a hundred meters of our lines before being reduced to a heap of corpses. The simultaneous volley of five organ guns created true massacres.\nThus the battles continued for days. Every night, black smoke and the stench of burned flesh became routine, shrouding the fields of death that surrounded us.\nBut then I began to feel it: the Dhar thickened more and more with each day. The beastmen shamans multiplied, and the magical corruption saturated the air.\nAnd it was on one of those days that an old rival appeared: a monstrous beastman of colossal proportions, carrying a massive boulder in his four arms, while several shamans used their magic to control him.\n\"Cannons… cannons! Here comes the finest prey of all,\" I said, grinning from ear to ear.\nThe beast began charging toward us, running with the enormous rock in its arms. It had barely advanced a few meters when the first explosion echoed from one of the most fortified sections of the wall. A projectile shot out at great speed, striking the monster's leg squarely and sending it crashing heavily to the ground.\nIt roared with fury, forcing itself back up. Its bellow was so deafening it could be heard for miles. Limping, it charged again at our defenses, slower but no less lethal. Several detonations shook the air; some shots missed, but others struck squarely in its chest. Another projectile smashed into its head as it tried to duck, tearing away part of its face and leaving its skull mangled.\nThe creature glared at us with pure hatred, staggering, trying to summon the strength to hurl the boulder. Its muscles tightened, but the cannons kept thundering with relentless precision. Each impact tore away chunks of flesh and bone until, finally, a blast louder than the rest marked the end: the colossus collapsed, crashing to the earth, while the shamans who controlled it stood stunned, unable to maintain their hold.\nThere was no time for celebration. After the monster's fall, a brutal charge shook the field. Armored wargors led the assault, followed by thousands of gors and ungors. The ground trembled beneath their hooves, and the air filled with warhorns and savage howls.\n\"To the walls, do not yield a step!\" I shouted, raising my gauntlet toward the artillery positions.\nThe deafening roar of the organ guns answered my command. The batteries fired in succession, tearing massive chunks out of the horde. Muskets and cannons joined in, turning the field into an inferno of fire and steel. The charge ended the same as all the others: with thousands of corpses piled high, bodies shredded, and blood flowing like rivulets before our defenses.Thɪs updatᴇd by ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nThe few survivors fled back into the forest, leaving behind a momentary silence broken only by smoke and the groans of the dying.\n\"Their momentum is spent… now it's our turn to strike,\" I murmured, my grin widening.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

A Sigmarite monster hunter, considered one of the most skilled in bringing such creatures down, advanced swiftly while switching the pistol in his hand.\nThe minotaur glared at him with pure hatred and charged again with blind fury, ignoring the wound in its eye and roaring like a demon. Another blast echoed, and once more the beast fell, howling. This time the shot had pierced its other eye, leaving it completely blind.\nThe monster thrashed in agony, guttural cries tearing through the air as the Graf's armored steps rang out, closing in.\nUnable to see, the minotaur sniffed the air violently and charged again in the Graf's direction, its resilience terrifying, as though blindness itself was not enough to bring it down.\nNearly every man stood frozen, unwilling to move even an inch for fear of becoming the beast's target. No one lifted a finger.\nSuddenly, the Graf began to move quickly, feinting with his legs, making noise with his armor. The disoriented minotaur swung its head side to side, following the clamor, utterly lost in its fury.\nIn an instant, the Graf's runic sword struck, slicing clean through and severing one of its legs. The monster crashed to the ground, bellowing in pain with a roar that chilled the blood.\nWithout giving it respite, the Graf leapt and landed atop the beast, grabbing one of its horns and driving his sword deep into its neck, cutting clean through to the throat. The minotaur thrashed wildly, its massive arms flailing backward in a desperate attempt to throw him off, but it was useless.\nThe final blow came: with a single, clean stroke, the Graf severed its head. The body continued to twitch while the Graf held the head aloft, grotesquely still jerking for a few seconds.\n\"Come on, lads… no fear, we still have plenty to kill,\" the Graf said calmly as he reloaded the pistols he had used.\nWe had the mission of cleansing one of those herdstones, since the beastmen were dwindling rapidly in the area. In a previous battle, thousands had fallen within hours: they came in waves, endured torrents of burning lead, fled only to return again and again to the same punishment… until nothing was left but mountains of smoldering corpses.\nBut now it was our turn to strike. Using the organ guns against so few enemies was wasteful, and by now we considered \"few\" to mean less than a hundred beasts attacking together. That was the level of brutality we had grown accustomed to under the southern noble.\nAnother explosion thundered, and another beastman collapsed face-first, its head shattered. The Sigmarite Graf's aim was almost unnatural: wherever he set his eye, the bullet landed. Even the hardened veteran musketeers of the fortress did not have that level of precision. His shots seemed almost like magic, always striking the eyes or the most vulnerable parts of the face.\nFinally, we reached our target a massive black stone, covered in blasphemous symbols, surrounded by flayed skins — a macabre reminder of these abominations' victims.\nFrom the woods came more beastmen, screaming as they charged at us.\nOnce again, the Graf broke from the group and fired all six of his pistols. Each shot was lethal: six bullets, six corpses collapsing with perfect holes in their skulls. He switched pistols with the speed of a duelist, tossing one aside only to draw another from the holsters strapped to his armor, advancing without fear, step by step.\nThe lone survivor, a huge gor wielding a crude, badly forged iron axe, raised his weapon and brought it down in a brutal swing. But the Graf stepped aside with a simple sidestep, and the blow bit only dirt and stone.\nAn instant later, the runic sword whistled through the air, and the beastman's head flew free, spilling a spray of black blood.\n\"Too easy… get into the caves and kill the rest of the beasts and any corrupted human you find. Someone fetch the Ulric priest,\" the Graf ordered, rolling his neck and stretching his arms as though the whole affair had been nothing more than a warm-up.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The forests are completely cleansed, all beastmen herds have been purified,\" said one of the local dukes, visibly euphoric about the campaign's outcome.\n\"Do not rest on the laurels of victory, Duke. The great victory against the beastmen is not achieved merely by destroying their numbers or their ability to reproduce. Their hiding places must be destroyed. I recommend you begin cutting down all local forests as soon as possible until nothing remains but a sea of stumps. Without shelter, you'll never have to worry about them again,\" I replied, looking seriously at the Middenland noble.\nThe noble slowly nodded. \"So it shall be, Graf Albrecht. I'll bring workers for the project, though I'll have to withdraw men from the line to protect them during their work.\"\n\"Fine by me. We must capitalize on these cleansed areas. That way, next year the surface to cover will be smaller. With no forests in the north, we only need to worry about the south, where the beastmen still gather,\" I said, pointing to the maps spread across the table.\n\"What about the Isenbuttel–Basdahl stretch? We sent three patrols there,\" I asked, searching for the report.\n\"The priests of Ulric have already been dispatched to purify those stones, Graf. With that, the area should be completely secured,\" another noble said.\n\"Perfect. Then prepare for the next beast wave. When we're done, we'll hunt down the stragglers, and once again the landowners must begin cutting down the forests. Chop them or burn them, it doesn't matter, but they must disappear. Without hiding places, there will be no threats,\" I stated firmly.\nA trio of nobles immediately nodded.\n\"With that we'll have long safe stretches, considerably reducing pressure. Now we must move west and burn more herdstones. Though…\" I murmured while reviewing the maps, \"…that would mean relocating the fortification and evacuating villages for the coming attacks.\"\nElector Count Boris intervened, supporting my reasoning. \"The ideal course would be to follow that route, cleansing at least the main stretches to further widen the distance between the trees and the roads. Not necessarily razing massive areas, but ensuring the trade route to Middenheim is secured.\"\n\"Yes, that would be ideal. But moving this fortress will take at least two weeks, maybe more. I didn't bring supplies to raise two fortresses, and with harvest season so near, I'll have to withdraw. That means my cannons will withdraw as well,\" I replied coldly.\n\"Then let us do everything possible to destroy as many herdstones as we can. The more sections of the route are secured, the safer Ulric's faithful will be,\" Boris said, striking the table.\n\"Fine. Once we finish with the next wave, we'll see what we can do,\" I said, closing the maps and leaving the tent.\nThe hunt reignited. We had cleansed vast stretches, isolating forested areas so the local nobles could cut them down. Perhaps Taal would curse us for ravaging his sacred trees, but damn it, it was necessary. Beastmen would never cease being a threat as long as they had places to hide, breed, or feed. Losing an ecosystem is a small price if it ensures humanity's survival.\nThe next wave of monsters arrived, and the slaughter repeated. This time, the shamans desperately tried to keep their troops united, blinding them with magic so they wouldn't fear the piled fields of corpses that darkened the horizon. But all they accomplished was to add hundreds more beasts to those heaps of charred flesh.\nUnlike before, the shamans began fleeing and hiding in distant caves. They had learned the hard way after we trapped a group in an already-cleansed cavern: the Ulricans, blood-hungry, massacred them without mercy.\nI ordered patrols to intercept the stragglers, always hoping to catch more magical leaders. Once eliminated, we resumed advancing toward more herdstones, each time closer to evacuated villages. Meanwhile, peasants returned to their lands, confident they were safe.\nThe Cult of Ulric, for its part, pledged to support the peasants and local nobles with supplies and coin, dedicating the rest of the year to felling trees. My strategy had sunk deep into them: deny the enemy everything. No food, no shelter, no rest. Total war.\nBut by the campaign's end, the Ulricans grew reckless: they wanted to burn as many herdstones as possible before I left with my cannons. The last week was the bloodiest yet: waves of ungors wielding stolen Imperial weapons, hundreds of wargors leading like living walls… and two massive four-armed beasts tearing through everything in their path. One of those creatures hurled such a colossal boulder that it crushed dozens of my men even under artillery fire.\nBut like all the rest, they fell. And with them, any hope the beastmen had of resisting us.\nThe field ended covered with more corpses than I had ever seen, by day's end nothing but piles of bloody flesh shredded by the countless blasts of shrapnel that had stolen the beastmen's lives.\nOnce again, my idea of cleansing these forests was cut short by the harvest season. Unfortunately, I could not afford to be away at that moment, for it was one of the most important for me: the true test of how effective my plan to monopolize the lands of Reinsfeld had been.\nSo, when it was all over, I stayed one more day, waiting for calm to settle. I observed the forests and noticed they were surprisingly peaceful. Before departing, I unleashed my magic: I felt the metallic pulse in the air and confirmed that the signals of iron that had once saturated the area were now scarce. What remained were the axes of peasants chopping trees. In other areas, the silence was absolute: no trace of iron, no hostile presence. At last, many of the regions once contested by beastmen were now empty, ready to be reclaimed by humanity.\nBefore departing, I carried out one last recruitment, permitted by the local lords. Many nobles were euphoric: some grateful to see vast stretches of their lands cleared, others simply satisfied because one or two nearby herds had been destroyed. We had probably eliminated three or four times more than last year; with so many enemies thrown against us, it was impossible to even keep count.\nElector Count Boris himself granted me a considerable reward: one hundred thousand gold crowns. Since the exact number of beasts slain could not be determined, he chose to pay me based on the estimate of two shillings per beastman head. Not a negligible sum, considering that Middenheim is not as wealthy as Altdorf, where that amount would have been handed over with ease.\nThus, I returned victorious, giving much of the gold obtained to the Ulrican nobles who had allowed me to recruit in their lands. Many of the recruits —if not all— had decided to move with me to Reikland, bringing their families along. The Ulricans were surprised to hear what my own men proudly repeated:\"There are no beastmen in Reinsfeld. The Graf has wiped them out.\"\nThat simple truth was enough for them to prefer leaving Middenland behind and settling under my protection. Moreover, I offered them gold as compensation for establishing themselves in my domains. Thus, of the three thousand Ulrican recruits I had obtained in the campaign, almost ten thousand additional people —entire families— would come with me as new peasants.\nAs soon as I finished handing out economic compensation to the nobles for the peasants lost, we set out on the return journey to Reinsfeld. Crossing the Reik delayed us once again: I had to negotiate once more with merchants eager to grow rich by filling their pockets with my gold. At last, we reached Shilderheim and, after days of travel, arrived back in my lands.\nThe time away had not been long, but the city had changed greatly in my absence. Several of the old houses in Reinsfeld's historic center had been demolished and replaced with new buildings, modernizing its structure. The temple-hospital of Shallya was still under construction, but my bank was nearly finished. The dwarfs of Durna had done a magnificent job: the solid structure looked like a miniature fortress, with vaults and doors covered in runes of security that made it more impregnable than Reinsfeld's castle itself, which by comparison seemed little more than a watchtower.\nWith our arrival —almost thirteen thousand more people— I immediately began distributing the new inhabitants into their residences. Otto had foreseen this: there were still many empty houses in Reinsfeld and Merxheim. The Bretonnians, on the other hand, continued living in barracks, as they were gradually sent to the mining villages or the greenhouses, where their labor was needed. They rarely complained, which gave us time to assimilate them into Reikspiel, supported by a charismatic priest of Sigmar blessed by the god himself. Every time this priest spoke, Sigmar's light seemed to envelop him at once, convincing all of his faith.\nOnce each new Ulrican had their home, whether in Reinsfeld or Merxheim, and received the gold payment for settling in my lands, all my attention turned to one thing: my fields.\nThe very same ones my agricultural advisor had arranged following my specifications, and now they were brimming with a harvest that, at first glance, was an absolute triumph. The wheat looked healthy, tall, and strong, with nearly forty grains per ear: double what had once been considered a good yield. In some fields, the barley had done even better, tripling normal production.\nThe enormous daily expense of keeping most of the population working the land, instead of devoting themselves to artisan or mercantile trades, had borne fruit. The fields were covered with wheat, barley, potatoes, and vegetables, while the greenhouses produced cotton in quantities we had only dreamed of before.\nFor days on end, work was unceasing to bring in the harvest in Reinsfeld and Merxheim. The new granaries and silos we had built overflowed with grain, yet still seemed insufficient in the face of such abundance. Otto's watermills worked at full capacity, grinding the wheat that piled up in mountains.\nIt didn't take long for rumors to spread: people said we had achieved the most bountiful harvest in the entire history of the Empire. Thousands of tons of grain filled our stores, and the first cotton harvest from our greenhouses was sent to the dwarfs to be turned into gunpowder, marking the beginning of a new era of self-sufficiency.\nWith this step, the costs of producing gunpowder dropped drastically. What had once yielded us only the barest of profits now became a minor expense: merely paying a group of Bretonnians to work the greenhouses. Far cheaper than bringing cotton from Araby, and far safer for my future plans.\nI now had the gold and the time to begin even more ambitious projects… and to secure my political power, ensuring no one could attempt to exploit my creations.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

My gold reserves were overflowing, my granaries nearly bursting, and it was time to put that surplus to work, transforming it into new sources of wealth. Nothing and no one would stand in my way—not even the Kesselheims. If it weren't for the constant vigilance of the witch hunters, I would have taken care of them personally already.\nBut that was a matter for tomorrow. What mattered now was creating more businesses to monopolize and sell.\nAfter spending some time with my griffon—who had grown finicky of late, refusing to eat dead meat and demanding live prey that squealed—I secured a rabbit, which he tore apart with beak and talons. Only a few months had passed since he hatched, yet he already showed the hunger and hunting instinct of a much larger beast.\nBack to work, the most logical step was to take advantage of the grain surplus. With granaries full, I held the power to dictate policies that would shape the region's economy. One option was to lower bread prices to placate the people, but that required caution: many families baked their own bread, and bakeries—few though they were—remained popular. Distributing flour directly could ruin bakers, but subsidizing them by providing flour at low cost would guarantee cheap bread without harming their profits. Either path required calculation and control.\nBeyond bread, there was another far more profitable path: alcohol. With so much wheat and barley on hand, and skilled dawi artisans nearby, establishing large-scale distilleries and breweries was an opportunity too good to miss. The risks were minimal: no dangerous sorcery, no lethal substances—just fermenting grains and distilling spirits. All it required was organization and resources.\nWithin a week, a group of peasants-turned-apprentices were working at new stills, guided by a proud dawi who never missed the chance to boast about the superiority of his race's beer. Arrogant as he was, his advice ensured the process ran smoothly from the start.\nMeanwhile, in my laboratory, I ordered the underground sections expanded. There, with the help of the dwarves, we began working on more advanced methods: distilling pure alcohol. Dangerous to handle, but extremely useful. At high concentrations it served as a solvent; at lower ones, as an indispensable disinfectant for hospitals and military campaigns.\nThus, part of my grain surplus was funneled into mass production of beer and spirits, while hundreds of peasants labored at the mills. Silos overflowed with freshly processed flour, and yet we kept producing more.\nBut this was only a small seed for the future. My conversations with Durán's dawi clan revolved around two grand projects. The first: steamships for the Reik, creating my own trade fleet. Rutger would have welcomed this—after all, having merchants selling in local markets was one thing, but owning a company that could transport massive cargoes across cities was another entirely.\nYet those talks died quickly. Durán estimated at least five years before the first ship could even touch the Reik. Entire facilities, docks, and shipyards had to be built before a single hull was assembled. A long-term dream.\nThe second project, however, bore more immediate promise: a railway between my cities. The journey from Reinsfeld to my laboratory was three hours on foot, or one on horseback, but by train… mere minutes. Far less ambitious than building a dawi ironclad, and thus the engineers viewed it favorably. With enough steel and patience, it was entirely feasible.\nBetween my own forges and the dwarves' ever-expanding foundries within the mountains—of which, in theory, I was owed a share of production—the project was fully within reach.\nIf successful, I would sit at the heart of Imperial trade. The Reik was humanity's lifeline, and shipowners lined their pockets moving goods from market to market. But ships had limits: cargo capacity, speed, dependence on the river. A train, however, could move colossal amounts of goods in record time, at prices that would crush the competition.\nI could almost taste the strategy: open railway routes from my lands to Altdorf, and perhaps extend them to Marienburg and beyond. By offering transport so cheaply that river merchants collapsed, I could wage an economic war—silent, devastating. Once their fleets were gone, I would raise prices and consolidate myself as the sole provider of an essential service.\nIt was a bold plan, breaking with mercantile tradition. But if it worked… I would become the richest and most influential man in the Empire.\nAll depended, however, on the dawi. Whether they would share their knowledge or not. My own experience with engines was limited to military vehicles and emergency repairs. Building a locomotive capable of hauling tons of cargo along rails was another matter entirely. For that, I relied completely on them.\n\"Then… I need the railway line to pass through my laboratory and extend directly to Merxheim. From there, a secondary track should branch off toward Reinsfeld. And from Reinsfeld, I want to explore the possibility of stretching it to Altdorf and linking that same line to Marienburg. Of course, I don't yet have the permits for that… but I'm confident I'll be able to negotiate them before construction begins,\" I said, showing the maps to the dawi engineers gathered around Durán.\nThe dwarves began speaking in Khazalid among themselves. I could see the unease on many faces: those engineers who had worked in my laboratories smiled with confidence, but those unfamiliar with me looked tense and wary.\n\"Dawongi… this is complicated, truly. Never before has such a creation of this scale been entrusted to the umgi. We know you can be trusted and would never try to claim dawi technology as your own… but I worry about other umgi. What will happen when this marvel leaves your lands? Who guarantees it won't fall into the wrong hands?\" Durán asked gravely.\n\"Clearly, it will be protected as what it is: a marvel of technology. I will assign my best men to guard both the rails and the trains. And once this industry takes off, the Emperor himself will secure it legally. This will be far too vital to the Empire to leave unprotected,\" I answered firmly.\n\"Indeed…\" said one of Durán's clan engineers. \"But you also know these machines require constant maintenance, repairs, adjustments… and no umgi could handle that, nor could we teach them. So dozens of dawi will need to work in these facilities permanently.of course, provided allied clans are the ones to supply the workers.\"\n\"That won't be a problem, on the contrary. It's my intention for this project to be shared. I know I'm asking something enormous in exchange for little, which is why I want to include it in our gunpowder agreement. The profits this enterprise produces will be divided in the same proportion. I will handle permits, security, and absorb any losses, while you ensure it all functions as what it is: a dawi masterpiece,\" I replied without hesitation.\nDurán let out a heavy sigh.\n\"There is something else that troubles us, dawongi…\" one of his engineers said after glancing at their lord. \"We want to ask what has happened with the profits from gunpowder in the Empire. Months have passed without news of our rightful share. We know we owe you much, but we cannot allow our clan's honor to be doubted.\"\n\"Oh, yes… the gunpowder,\" I said calmly. \"I'm afraid I haven't sold any yet, my friends. I know it sounds strange, but it's the truth. Unlike you, who trust the loyalty of your clans, among the umgi greed is always lurking. They would soon try to steal the formula, or use political influence to force me to sell it cheaply—or worse, give it away for scraps. So I've spent this time securing political favors, weaving alliances with Imperial institutions. Soon I'll guarantee nothing will go wrong and sales will begin… and when that day comes, there will be no shortage of gold for you, as you deserve.\"\n\"That eases my mind, dawongi… I almost thought you were trying to deceive us,\" Durán said, finally relaxing.\n\"I would never dare break our pacts, friends of the mountains. Our alliance and cooperation are vital for both of us to prosper. Umgi and dawi need one another to survive in these dark times, where an enemy lurks in every shadow. Now, more than ever, we must trust each other. I would sooner endure the most unimaginable torture than betray your trust,\" I replied solemnly.\n\"Thank you, dawongi. It calms me greatly to hear that. I suppose you all see now what kind of umgi our ally is: a true friend,\" said Durán, looking at the other dwarves. \"That is why I insisted you consider him, and why we must resolve this matter as soon as possible.\"\nThe dawi began speaking in Khazalid again, but this time jovially, even smiling, instead of the tension that had dominated at the start. The discussion grew intense with calculations and technical remarks, but ended in agreement: the clans would help carry out the railway enterprise.\nWithin hours, a group of engineers were already spreading out blueprints, designing locomotives, wagons, and evaluating the most viable terrain to fulfill my intentions as faithfully as possible. Their speed surprised me, though I soon understood why: during my absence, more clans had arrived in the mountains, increasing the dwarven population and, with it, the capacity of their forges.\nI returned then to my usual tasks, overseeing my bank, which was practically finished—only minor decorations remained. But as I pondered whom to entrust with managing the loans, I was astonished to discover the dawi had already begun laying rails on the leveled ground, advancing over considerable stretches.\nIt was clear: my plans could wait no longer. If I wanted this to work as I envisioned, I had to travel to Altdorf and speak directly with the Emperor. It would not be a matter of favors—experience had taught me those are far too costly—but of paying the price necessary to secure the lands and permits.\nStill, with some luck, I might obtain them relatively cheaply if the Emperor needed more funds for the electors' bribes or the Bretonnian campaign.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Their discipline and strength pushed the work forward at a furious pace. They were laying kilometers of railway in mere hours, driving spikes into rock as if it were butter. I couldn't tell if it was because they already had standardized designs or simply because their craftsmanship was unmatched, but they were advancing far too quickly for my plans. I had hoped for time to secure the lands calmly; now I had to rush to consolidate my control before the project overtook me.\nNearly two thousand dawi were spread across my domains—some measuring and surveying, others leveling ground and packing crushed stone—and as soon as the terrain was ready, the rails fell into place and were secured instantly. It was only a matter of time before my cities were bound together by iron and steel, transforming the region completely.\nAware of this, I gathered my resources and made a practical decision: to buy my own ship. I could no longer depend on Schilderheim, where the merchant guilds despised me for forcing them to lower tariffs and lose privileges. What I considered strategy to grow one of my cities, they saw as humiliation. And they would not forget.\nI invested in a solid vessel and a reliable crew, setting out for Altdorf without delay. For of all the lands the railway needed to cross, the most critical were under the Emperor's direct authority. If I wanted the line to remain straight and efficient, I needed his permission. Some stretches were in the hands of the Elector Count of Carroburg, others under Schilderheim, but the decisive territory belonged to His Majesty.\nThus, I made the journey in haste, knowing my future depended on convincing one man. And though I wasn't sure how long it would take to gain an audience, in Altdorf—where electors and nobles alike swarmed after gold and imperial favor now that the Emperor had vast coffers at his disposal—I expected opportunities.\nI soon approached the Imperial Palace and requested an audience. To my fortune—or unease—it was granted immediately, since not long before I had been summoned to Altdorf for the beastmen cleansing. It felt almost like divine providence: if they had not decided what reward to grant me, I was arriving with the solution in hand. I donned my armor and blue garments to present myself with proper dignity.\nUnlike the last time I saw him in the Volkshalle or in great feast halls, this meeting was far more private. The Emperor sat in a simple chamber, handling administrative affairs, surrounded by members of the Reiksguard as he worked with quill over thick volumes.\n\"So, Graf Albrecht, to what do I owe the pleasure of you requesting an audience in my palace? Quite rare, considering you seem to detest the capital of the Empire, rushing back to your domains at the earliest chance.\" The Emperor set his quill back in the inkwell and regarded me calmly.\n\"A proposal, Your Majesty. A proposal, to be frank…\" I answered, meeting his gaze while noting the Reiksguard poised to spring at the slightest move.\n\"And what proposal is this, young Albrecht? Offering to cleanse the forests of Reikland? I heard your hunt in Middenland was a great success. Entire stretches of forest laid bare, local lords ensuring no tree remains standing, following your orders, so that next year's work will be even swifter.\" The Emperor laced his fingers, intrigued.\n\"I need to acquire some of your lands, Your Majesty, and even a part of the city of Altdorf. As you know, my friendship with the dawi runs deep, and we've reached an agreement for them to build a steam train for me. At first, I thought only of my territories, to ease the transport of goods, but then I realized this could greatly benefit the Empire if such a railway extended to Altdorf.\"\nSilence filled the room. The Emperor studied me steadily.Thɪs NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n\"I see you come with clear ideas of what you seek… then tell me, young Graf, which lands do you require me to give you? And explain also why you need part of the city.\" His eyes probed with curiosity.\n\"My plan is to draw a direct railway line to Altdorf. For that, the track would pass through Holthusen, in territories under your governors' administration, then raise a bridge over the Schilder River and cross straight through your lands, bypassing Schilderheim. With the Count of Carroburg I can still negotiate, but the key point is to reach Altdorf, where I wish to build a railway station. There, goods would be unloaded, machines serviced, and all railway traffic centralized.\"\nThe Emperor frowned, thoughtful, as though trying to grasp the scale of what I proposed. \"And you truly believe this will benefit the Empire?\" he asked at last.\n\"Without any doubt, Majesty. It will allow immense quantities of resources to be transported from my domains to the capital. It will drive commerce by moving goods in bulk with ease, beyond the matter of securing the routes. It is dawi technology—solid and proven. With this, Altdorf will be supplied swiftly and safely.\"\n\"Dwarven technology, then…\" the Emperor murmured, leaning forward.\n\"Indeed, Majesty. Dawi technology in its entirety. I have sealed an agreement with them to bring this project to life.\"\n\"Tell me then, what can your cities offer that justifies confronting the merchant guilds with such an innovation?\"\n\"Grain, my Emperor. A great deal of grain. We've had one of the most abundant harvests in decades. With the size of my farms, my lands enjoy a surplus of food. I am considering sending that surplus to the capital, which would considerably lower the price of bread if you so ordered.\" I smiled confidently, knowing this argument struck a sensitive point.\n\"It is never a mistake to ensure food reaches Altdorf. That will appease the most destitute among my people. As for me, I see no issue.\" The Emperor nodded slowly.\n\"I am glad to hear that, Majesty. But there is something else. In this case it requires the use of the Imperial ambassadors, since I am no diplomat. I would need you to intercede on my behalf with the city of Marienburg to make a similar offer. If we can connect Reinsfeld with Marienburg, the commercial benefit to the Empire would be immense. We could bring goods from that port in a matter of hours.\"\nThe Emperor tilted his head and smiled with a hint of malice. \"Aha… so I see your request is more complex than I thought. Marienburg does not look kindly on such proposals, and what you ask will not be easy. However, in consideration of your service to the Empire, I will grant you the lands and rights you seek, young Graf… but that favor you ask of me with Marienburg will come at a price. You will also have to do something for me.\"\nThe Emperor's smile widened.\n\"And what would that price be?\" I asked, already suspecting the Emperor would demand something excessive.\n\"I have heard —and not from minor rumors— that several guilds in Altdorf have attempted to open branches in your cities and were sharply rejected. I have received formal complaints and even pressure from these guilds to force you to accept them. Before I make a decision, I want to hear from your own lips the reason for that rejection.\" The Emperor spoke, hands clasped calmly.\n\"Majesty, those 'guilds' believed they were doing me a favor by moving into my cities. They came with the arrogance of demanding I hand over my industries into their hands without giving me anything in return. The blacksmiths' guild, for example, wanted me to cede all my blast furnaces and the craftsmen working for me… free of charge. The brewers' guild wanted to impose a ban on selling beer produced in my own lands. The tanners demanded I gift them pigments and treated leather as an obligatory tribute. And I could go on, one after another, all with the same vulture-like attitude circling easy prey.\nThey did not seek partnership, nor to invest. They wanted to strip me of my resources, absorb the fruit of my people's labor, and leave me with no control over what I have built,\" I said bitterly, remembering their arrogant demands.\n\"I see… it is often common practice for those guilds to take advantage of growing towns without much industry, but considering the size of Reinsfeld, the situation is different. Still, I wish to rid myself of their constant complaints, so my condition for aiding you with Marienburg is that you allow them to establish themselves in your cities. You do not have to give them anything, but at least they will stop plaguing me with letters every month.\" The Emperor replied firmly.\n\"Pff… that will bring problems. The guilds are a group of…\" I muttered under my breath.\n\"Of peasants with money who abuse their economic power, I know perfectly well. I have dealt with them far too many times, demanding tax privileges or monopolies. But they are part of any city, and the sooner you learn to manage them, the easier it will be when they try to challenge you in the future.\" The Emperor replied, with a faint, ironic smile.\n\"Indeed… I had already made some preparations knowing sooner or later they would try to force their way in. Very well, I accept your conditions. I hope the intervention of the Imperial diplomats in Marienburg proves successful. If the project is realized, it will be one of the greatest transformations in transportation the Empire has ever seen.\" I answered with a controlled smile.\n\"Let us hope so, young Albrecht. I trust your idea will move swiftly.\" The Emperor remarked, taking up his quill again.\n\"It will. Likely by next year it will already be ready. With so many dawi working, I doubt it will take long.\" I replied, noting how the Emperor raised both brows.\n\"I will send the order to my diplomats. Is there anything else you wish to discuss with me?\" he finished, reopening his books.\n\"No, Emperor… I take my leave. I thank you greatly for this audience.\" I rose, bowing before turning away.\n\"I almost forgot… you will be participating in the Nuln weapons contest next year, correct? I recall you were formally invited, but there were doubts about your attendance.\" He added before I left.\n\"I do not think I can, Majesty. I lack the capacity to produce so many weapons at once. Even if I won, I could not supply the Empire with my own arsenal.\" I answered with a tense smile.\n\"You do know you can sell the design for Nuln to reproduce, don't you?\" the Emperor replied calmly.\n\"Oh… I did not know, I thought that came with production.\" I feigned ignorance, tilting my head.\n\"Just make sure you attend. Only days ago, the Elector Count of Middenheim spoke highly of the precision of your weapons. They could become the new standard model for the Empire.\" The Emperor said, finally gesturing toward the exit.\nI wasted no time. I left the Imperial Palace and returned to my residence in the capital, knowing my next destination was Carroburg. I needed to negotiate with the Elector Count of Middenland for the purchase of key lands for the railway line. Once the preparations were ready, I set sail with my guards toward Carroburg. There, with a swift audience and a few bags of gold, I obtained the stretch of land I needed. The deal included the promise of building a railway station in Carroburg, thus linking the city to the future network of lines that would change the Empire.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I trudged forward, muttering, drove the bayonet into its throat, and twisted the blade hard—more out of spite than necessity.\n\"Damn creatures… uglier every day,\" I growled, shaking the steel clean before returning to the line.\n\"They're few,\" said one of the musketeers as he reloaded with stiff, frozen hands. \"Twenty at most, and the sun's still high.\"\n\"You're too used to Middenland,\" I replied, ramming a fresh ball into the barrel. \"Over there, you've got fortresses and cannons. Here we've got none of that. Here we're just flesh with gunpowder, making sure the dwarfs keep hammering away at their damned iron.\"\n\"And wasn't the Graf's army supposed to be clearing out the forests?\" asked another, his voice heavy with fatigue.\n\"Yes, but this isn't Middenland, Ulrican. Here the cold isn't the problem—it's the season. The mud swallows boots whole, and the forests never seem to end. Instead of waiting for them to strike, we have to wade into those rotting trees and drag them out by the throat. And meanwhile, where the hell are the men working on the palisade?\" I snapped, glancing south.\n\"They're still back with the supply wagons. Ground's too soft for digging. They say they need to reach the bedrock before they can keep building,\" one of them answered, sweat running down under his cloak despite the icy wind, pickaxe in hand as he jabbed holes into the muck.\nThe Graf had sent us out in a season when no one in their right mind would march. Autumn was fading, and winter already bit at our faces. But this time he hadn't just dispatched small patrols—he'd mobilized far more men to guard that damned long, metal work the dwarfs were raising. Huge beams of iron and planks of wood were joined by colossal nails their stone-like arms hammered down, as if the cold didn't even exist.\nThe ground, though, punished us. Half-felled forests, clearings turned to swamps, beasts lunging from nowhere every couple of hours. Ahead lay the woods of Holthusen, stinking of rot and crawling with beastmen, and we had to keep advancing with frozen feet and stiff hands, while the dwarfs labored as if it were midsummer.\nBlessed Sigmar… I'd agreed to this for the easy pay, when most jobs barely took us beyond Reinsfeld. At most, we'd march as far as Middenland, and always in summer, when the sun warmed your back and the nights didn't leave your bones numb. For that, we were paid well—better than any peasant could dream of earning in a lifetime. But now… now this was a frozen hell itself. They expected us to risk our lives against beasts and brigands, with no walls, no fortifications, and all for the same coin as always.\nI couldn't fathom how the dwarfs could keep working in this cold—let alone so fast. Together they hauled those massive steel bars, set them on the ground like they were mere planks, and hammered those monstrous nails into the prepared earth, one after the other, without rest, as if winter didn't exist. I could hardly feel my fingers in this wind, and they carried on sweating beneath their beards.\nSigmar willing, may this madness end soon. Let them hammer their iron, raise their road of steel, and may the gods grant us winter under a roof and blanket—not frozen like abandoned dogs in this mire.\n---------------\nPOV army trainer\nKaldezeit-17,2490 IC\n\"After firing, you must take a powder bag and load it from the front of the weapon, like this,\" I explained, raising the musket. I tore off the top of the cartridge with my teeth and poured the powder into the barrel. \"Then pack it down with the ramrod, firm and tight, and only then place the shot. One last strike with the ramrod, and you're ready to fire again.\"\nMany began to imitate me—some clumsily, others with eager hands. The field filled with the echo of shots and explosions, a constant roar that made the air tremble. Thousands of recruits practiced at once, and the burned powder left that sharp, heavy smell hanging in the wind.\n\"Good! Repeat the process over and over again,\" I urged in a firm voice. \"Learn the correct procedure first—the aim will come later. Don't worry if you miss, what matters is being ready when the day of battle comes.\"\nI watched the lads under my charge as they struggled to reload quickly. Some cursed when the ramrod jammed, others grinned as if they were playing at a fair. I, however, felt proud of them all.\nFor reasons only the Graf and Sigmar Himself know, he had decided this time to recruit an unprecedented number of men. It was not as before, when one or two thousand would arrive every so often to bolster our ranks. No. After the last campaign, three thousand had joined us, and now suddenly another ten thousand came to our banner—men of Altdorf, Carroburg, peasants… all called to serve something greater than themselves.\nThe Graf did it for the Empire—for order, for the peace Sigmar demanded of His children. My duty was simple, yet sacred: to teach them the basics, to give them the discipline they would need when the great day came. Then we would defend the railway the dwarfs were building. And when that day arrived, all would see that the Graf had been right—that Sigmar guided his hand—and that every drop of sweat and powder had been worth it.\nTime was scarce. I had to train them as quickly as possible and distribute weapons among them. But there weren't enough muskets for every recruit, so we had to rotate. One group fired and reloaded while another waited their turn to practice. It wasn't ideal, but as long as everyone learned the fundamentals, I considered it enough.\nI would like to say it was the same training the Graf had given us the first time, when he drilled us with patience and discipline—running us over hills in full armor, teaching us to endure exhaustion. But it wasn't. Now I could only show them how to use a weapon, reload under pressure, and march in line. Nothing more. The urgency pressed on all of us.\nBefore long, the days were consumed and they had to march west. Their true training would continue there, where it had all begun, but in far harsher conditions. Many of these men—more laborers than soldiers—would also be used as manpower, for there was much to be done. The Graf had secured an agreement with Marienburg: a vast, almost unbelievable deal.\nThe negotiations ended in triumph: lowering the costs of transporting Imperial goods, a masterstroke ensuring profit and stability. But in return, part of the pact demanded labor. The Graf pledged to employ his dwarf allies, together with thousands of Imperial arms, to build dikes, dig drainage canals, and raise dwarf pumps to drain the swamps. Cursed, waterlogged land would become solid, fertile ground—for the benefit of Marienburg.\nSo that was where we marched. The recruits—half soldiers, half workers, for there was much to do. And I, to take up the role of guard while they kept laying down the rails.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Don't they understand the agreement is already sealed and there's nothing left to negotiate with anyone?\" I snapped, slamming my hand on the table.\n\"It's very unpopular in the city. Many people lost everything with the trade blockade on the Reik that young noble organized… and well, he sank several of the city's ships. So many lives were taken, even my—\"\n\"Yes, yes, yes, I know. Your brother was on one of those ships that blew into a thousand pieces. That's war. And don't bring that story up every time you want me to feel guilty. It has nothing to do with the business,\" I cut her off, tired of her constant insistence.\n\"But—\" she tried to protest.\n\"No buts, girl! The board already decided. Jaan van de Kuypers accepted as soon as he met the young Imperial. The bastard convinced him with a deal so juicy no one could have resisted. And while we all looked the other way, he went and bought up all the land along the path of the new railway. He secured the best slice of the pie and didn't even tell us. Clean move for him, a knife in the back for the rest of us,\" I spat angrily.\n\"I'm sorry,\" my assistant said, lowering her head before leaving.\nI stayed behind, muttering to myself: \"Damn dog… all he had to do was move his pawns, and he snatched one of the most profitable ventures Marienburg has ever seen. That railway is going to be a gold mine, and I don't even have a corner of the business. It will carry Imperial goods in days, while he dedicates all his ships to foreign trade. Thousands of extra gold coins, straight into his coffers!\"\nOf course the deal wasn't popular in the city. Many merchants went bankrupt when prices spiked from the blockade, others lost everything when their ships sank in the Reik. Entire families ruined. But what could they do? Nothing. The deal was sealed, and Jaan had maneuvered to take everything worth having.\nI had to resign myself to watching that damned railway grow day by day. The project advanced relentlessly, even in winter, with thousands of Imperial workers enslaved under forced contracts, and dwarf crews hammering steel rails as if the cold didn't exist. Meanwhile, the drained swamps turned into fertile lands, all signed under the name of Jaan van de Kuypers, who surely already planned how to turn every inch into more gold.\nI tried to contact the young Imperial running the project, offering sums that would have made any other man drool, but the bastard showed not the slightest interest. He didn't care how much gold I placed on the table. Nothing. He was so certain of his success that he saw no reason to let me in.\nThe streets burned with rumors. The dwarfs spoke openly of the wonders of their trains, how they could move tons of cargo in mere minutes. The small and medium merchants panicked: they knew it meant the end of their trade. If transporting goods became cheaper and faster than by ship, the gap between rich and poor would grow like never before.\nAnd I, sitting in my office, could only curse under my breath, watching Jaan van de Kuypers steal the opportunity of my lifetime.\n\"Damn Jaan van de Kuypers…\"\n------------------------------------\nNachhexen-7,2491 IC\nPOV of Guild leader in Reinsfeld\n\"This must be a damn joke… how is it possible they gave us this pigsty to set up our businesses?\" I said in disbelief, my face burning with rage.\n\"This is what the Graf agreed to grant us, so that we could settle in the city,\" answered one of the smiths who accompanied us, gesturing bitterly at that barren patch of land.\n\"Unheard of… simply unheard of! How can that noble think he can humiliate us like this? We are the Blacksmiths' Guild of Altdorf, not some band of provincial apprentices!\" I shouted, feeling my eye twitch with pure fury.\nAfter so much pressure, after months of discussions, we had finally forced that damned noble to yield. Our guild master had worked with others to push the Emperor himself to accept the establishment of guilds in these two new Imperial cities that had recently become hubs of mercantile traffic. And now, after all that effort—this. Empty land. As if we were beggars thrown a crust to shut us up.\nIt was already insult enough to be denied possession of his forges. What the hell does that noble know about smithing? Maybe which end of a sword to hold, but nothing more. Instead of leaving his forges in the hands of true professionals—men with generations of experience—he insists on keeping them under his own command, as if he knows anything beyond trading what others produce.\nBreaking him will take time, that much is clear. His businesses seem to be thriving and for now he enjoys a measure of popularity. But if we begin to pressure his buyers, if we demand guild certifications for his products to circulate, we can start cutting him off. In the end, he will be forced to hand over those forges, even if unwillingly.\nWhat stings the most is that the bastard seems eager to fight. He gave us the exact date to arrive, knowing full well we expected a proper place, and still he greeted us with wasteland. It was a declaration of war against the guilds, plain and simple.\nAnd soon, more colleagues from other guilds arrived, lured by the same promises. In the end, everyone received the same: empty land. No workshops, no buildings, even though there are plenty of abandoned shops and facilities belonging to the Graf's industries. We were certain they would be handed to us… but instead, we were thrown into the mud, as if they wanted to laugh in our faces.\nHe even placed us in the farthest corner from the market, away from the true flow of commerce, as if burying us alive.\nDays passed, and with no decent place to set up, we were forced to sleep in crowded, filthy taverns. Eventually more members of our guild arrived, accompanied by engineers prepared to raise blast furnaces and a new smithy. We had the funding; after all, the insult we suffered didn't sit well in Altdorf. Many were determined to support our cause—not only out of pride, but to surpass the noble's businesses and finally teach him the lesson he deserved.\nAt the same time, we tried to undermine him from within. We attempted to lure away his own workers, convincing them to join our ranks, promising better pay and fewer hours of toil. But it was far more difficult than expected. His workers showed an unusual personal loyalty to the Graf. And the head smith under him, a young man named Kurt—how he even came to hold his post I can barely fathom—watched us with thinly veiled hatred whenever we tried to negotiate.\nWe thought we had the upper hand… until the surprise came. The very next day we learned the Graf had doubled the wages of all his smiths and drastically cut their working hours.\nAnd that wasn't all. Soon we discovered the same policy applied to the brewers, the soap-makers, practically every industry under his command. A direct counterattack to our schemes, a show of force that made it clear this noble was willing to wield his wealth to buy his people's loyalty.\nThis battle was going to be far tougher than we ever imagined.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n-------------------------------",

We need to keep producing. How's the rifling on those muskets coming along?\" I asked the group of smiths handling the hardest part of the process.\n\"It's going well, sir,\" one of them replied, barely pausing for a second before rushing back to work.\nThere was too much to do. Our patron, Graf Albrecht, had suddenly decided to expand his armed forces to an incredible degree, which meant we had to increase weapon production to levels never before seen. We worked longer shifts, had new facilities, and even quintupled the workforce. And yet the problems remained: many of the newcomers were migrants from other provinces, apprentices rather than masters, and they needed to be taught the basics before they could stop being a hindrance.\nThe process wasn't simple. The Graf's gunpowder was stronger than usual, which meant every weapon had to be reinforced. The musket barrels had to be tough, or else they risked exploding in the soldier's hands. Even with those complications, we were producing nearly fifty muskets a day. And still, it wasn't enough: not only did we need to arm the new recruits, we also had to replace the worn-out and damaged pieces from training.\n\"Come on, drill harder! We need more barrels ready for rifling as soon as possible,\" I urged the smiths, who sweated over the hand drills, boring through the steel brought from the forges.\n\"Barrels, barrels,\" shouted another, hauling several freshly cooled pieces.\n\"On that table, quickly,\" I ordered while keeping the workflow organized.\nIt was a lot of effort, but who could complain? I hadn't even finished my studies at the University, yet I had my own weapons workshop, a generous patron who always met our requests, a home for my family, and protection from the militias. More than most could dream of.\nOf course, I wasn't the Graf's favorite—that place belonged to Mathias. Lately, he'd stopped focusing on regular work and instead devoted himself to designing new weapons, inspired by models from other provinces, like Hochland and even Nuln. He had even managed, through less-than-legal contacts, to get his hands on a repeating handgun. The craftsmanship was clearly mass-produced, not artisanal, but the design was ingenious. Ingenious enough that it inspired Mathias to create his own version.\nAnd Rutger, the Marienburg merchant, had somehow acquired a Leon Todmeister's Fantabulously Far-reaching Harquebus of Unforeseeable and Unperceived Bereavement—a weapon nearly impossible to find outside Hochland. For some reason, we now had one, and Mathias used it to copy its magnifying lens system.\nWhen the Graf saw his blueprints, he was thrilled. He gave Mathias even more ideas, and since then my colleague had locked himself in his workshop, leaving only to eat or use the latrine. He had become possessed by his work.\nThus, the management of our shared workshop fell to me, though I didn't see it as a burden. We just divided the tasks as always. Still, I'd soon have to request an assistant from the University of Altdorf, because rumors said we would compete in a contest to arm the state regiments. If we won, what we were doing now would be child's play compared to what came next.\nSmiths remained scarce in the region, but the Graf had a reputation for hiring anyone with even minimal experience. And with good reason: thanks to his new water-powered hammer forges, even apprentices could produce quality weapons and armor.\nThe days went by with the Graf visiting us several times, checking the flow of production and asking what we needed to keep up the pace. Weapon crates piled up in ever greater numbers, ready for their first shipment—though none of us knew where.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nAnd then, one day, Mathias finally came out of his workshop. As usual, he had that nervous air about him, but this time he was pushing something that forced him outside.\nIt was a kind of mini-cannon—though calling it \"mini\" was unfair. It had multiple barrels, much larger than the repeating handgun we had received as a reference. At a glance, it was clear it couldn't be operated by a single man. Yet Mathias glowed with pride.\n\"What is that?\" I asked, stepping closer with genuine curiosity.\n\"A creation I've been working on thanks to the Graf's suggestions. He kept coming with ideas about the firing system, and he promised me something fascinating,\" Mathias replied, his voice trembling but joyful.\n\"What did he promise you? I don't understand the mechanism,\" I said, leaning over the machine to examine it.\n\"The Graf, with help from some dwarven alchemists, created a system that ignites the powder with a single strike—no spark needed. So when you turn the crank, each barrel aligns and fires instantly.\"\n\"A single strike? No spark at all?\" I asked in astonishment.\n\"Yes. If it works as they say… we have in our hands a weapon capable of protecting the Empire like never before,\" Mathias added with a wide smile.\n\"Well… looks like it's finished,\" said the Graf at that moment, appearing behind us. We quickly raised our heads and gave a slight bow.\n\"Yes, my lord…\" Mathias stammered nervously.\n\"All ready for testing?\" the Graf asked.\n\"Just waiting for what you promised, then it will be operational, sir,\" I added, stepping forward to cover for my friend.\n\"Very well. I've prepared a testing field for this great day,\" said the Graf with a smile, hefting the prototype onto his shoulder with surprising ease.\nWe followed him to one of the military camps surrounding the city—since there were no walls, troops were always needed to keep watch. We arrived at a shooting range where several musketeers were practicing their aim.\n\"These are cartridges with mercury fulminate—a compound that ignites on impact,\" explained the Graf, showing us a steel box filled with paper cartridges topped with bullets.\nThe prototype was set onto a metal harness with wheels, almost as if it had been tailor-made for it. Mathias hurried to adjust a few pieces, and then the Graf placed the ammunition box into the upper slot.\n\"Before using it, cover your mouths and noses with this. Mercury fulminate is dangerous to inhale, though in the open air it won't be as harmful. Still, caution never hurts,\" he said, handing us damp cloths with small black stones embedded in them.\n\"Ah, almost forgot—ear protection,\" he added, showing us a bit of hardened wax for our ears.\nWe did as he instructed. I approached the weapon and grabbed the crank. As soon as I turned it, a deafening roar shook the field. The projectile smashed straight into a steel breastplate set before us, bending it violently.\nThe Graf gestured for me to continue. I turned the crank again, and four more shots rang out one after another. Then the weapon jammed.\n\"Hmm… looks like there's a fault in the sixth barrel. Mathias, can you fix it?\" said the Graf, crouching down to inspect it.\nMathias took a file and calmly worked on shortening the piece that was slightly longer than the others. We tried again, and this time every barrel fired without issue.\n\"Excellent. Here's more ammunition. Each barrel can fire at least twice,\" said the Graf, handing over another box. This time, he took the crank himself. With force, he spun it quickly, unleashing the entire volley in a matter of seconds.\n\"It works…\" said the Graf, his face spreading into a wide smile.\nMathias smiled too, though he quickly moved to check the barrels, ensuring everything was still in order.\n\"Seems we've got a fine creation on our hands…\" I said, still impressed.\n\"Yes, but the fulminate is a problem. It's too sensitive—one small knock could set it off. For now, it would only be viable in defensive positions, since transporting it poses a huge risk. We'll need to find a way to make it safer,\" the Graf mused.\n\"Do you need more of them built?\" I asked.\n\"As many as possible, along with every musket you can turn out. We have an order… one that will make me a very, very rich man. Perhaps the richest in the world,\" the Graf concluded, his eyes gleaming with ambition.\nOur work continued without pause. Mathias, back among us again, smeared his hands with soot and oil as he tirelessly joined us in producing more weapons. The musket orders seemed endless; nearly double what we already delivered was needed to meet the Graf's growing army demands. Day after day we filled crate after crate, stacking them to the ceiling in the warehouses. From time to time, we also had to deliver another of those new repeating machines, which the Graf stored away like war treasures—though there was always one kept ready to be dispatched.\nTime passed, and outside the workshop, the only news that reached us were the trials of heretics dragged in weekly by the witch hunters. Nothing interfered with our routine. Until the news arrived that changed everything: the first dwarven train had left the station and reached Reinsfeld.\nWhat we saw was incredible. Dozens of wagons loaded with iron, coal, tin, and other ores—all purchased directly from the dawi by the Graf. The convoy thundered into the city, and in an instant several of the sealed transport cars were exchanged with admirable efficiency.\nThat day, Reinsfeld celebrated like never before. Food was given freely in the plazas—meat, fresh bread, and vegetables from the latest harvest—all paid for from the Graf's own purse. Beer and liquor flowed from hand to hand, and the entire city became a single voice of jubilation. The witch hunters, with their stern glares, watched over it all, but even their presence was swallowed by the merriment.\nThe next day, the celebrations gave way once again to our reality. We were tasked with loading entire wagons with weapons: crate after crate of muskets, ammunition, powder, and even a few cannons. The trains departed for Marienburg filled nearly to the brim, roaring over the new tracks that stretched farther than the eye could see.\nAnd when they were gone—laden with iron and gunpowder—we returned to the monotony of our workshop, sweating over anvils and drills, fulfilling the duty that had made us so indispensable. Endless work, yes—but also a safe life, well-paid, with a future few in the Empire could ever hope to dream of.\n-------------------------------\nPOV of member of the Directorate\nSigmarzeit-20,2491 IC\nThe atmosphere in the city was unbearable. The train—damned thing—had been built with twin tracks, straight into Suiddock. Thousands of people gathered around the area. Many were those displaced by the works: whole families torn from their homes because those cursed tracks had cut straight through old districts, entire neighborhoods wiped off the map. It was deeply unpopular. And yet, the elites of Marienburg were all there, smiling in their finest silks, waiting for the train's first journey. No one wanted to be left behind in this new way of shipping goods into the Empire.\nThe Directorate had summoned all its members as well. Jaan—that cunning dog—was about to prove just how far his influence could reach inside the Empire. And us? We were left to clap like fools.\nThe air was tense: shouts of protest mixed with the murmur of merchants and wizards. And then the sound reached us. First, the shrill whistle of steam, then the metallic behemoth rolled into the city, dragging an endless chain of wagons. Railway workers hurried to open and unload them.\nThe crowd erupted into cheers. Applause, ovations, celebrations of dwarven genius. Each one of those damned rich men was already counting their future profits, imagining how much gold would fill their coffers thanks to this deal. And then we saw him.\nThe young Graf. The same man who had been an enemy of the city, who had humiliated us time and again. He climbed atop the train, clad—of all things—in full dwarven armor.\n\"Rejoice, citizens of Marienburg!\" he cried, his voice booming, fist raised high. \"Today you are finally bound to the Empire by this marvel of dawi engineering!\"\nBut in that very instant… something happened. Several wizards began coughing violently, clutching their throats, choking as if invisible hands were strangling them. Panic erupted at once.\n\"Today this farce of secession ends!\" thundered the Graf. \"You will return to the fold of DEUS SIGMAR!\"\nSuddenly, the train's wagons yawned open like the jaws of a monster. They weren't carrying goods at all—inside were cannons aimed straight at us, and Imperial soldiers leaping down in perfect formation, ready to strike.\n\"Remember—no dawi deaths!\" roared the Graf, fists clenched. And at that signal, the cannons thundered.\nThe blast shook me to my very soul. I felt the shrapnel strike my chest, my breath stolen as I fell backward. The world became smoke, fire, and screams. I heard merchants pleading for their lives, women shrieking in the chaos of the stampede, and above it all—the ceaseless roar of gunfire.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Twenty organ guns fired in unison from the train, spewing molten shrapnel into the crowd that had so naively gathered to celebrate the construction. The festivity turned into a massacre in mere seconds. The earth was drenched in blood, screams drowned in the thunder of the cannons, and bodies were hurled in every direction like rag dolls.\n\"Shoot them!\" my men roared, aiming at the few wretches who had survived the first volley.\nI leapt from the train, landing lightly thanks to the blessed gromril armor I wore, its dawi runes glowing faintly across the surface. A gift from Duran—and one that in that instant made me feel invincible.\nAt once, the houses near the tracks burst open and out poured more of my so-called \"railway workers\"—in truth, recruits from Altdorf and Carroburg. Men who had learned quickly to wield muskets and now handed weapons to our soldiers as though they were loaves of bread.\nThe fools of Marienburg had never suspected that those draining their swamps and laying their rails were no mere laborers, but a hidden levy, ready for war. Their mistake would be their doom.\n\"Quickly, the bridge!\" I commanded, pointing to the structure linking the north and south of the city. \"It's the key to controlling Marienburg. Take it before the merchant families' militias react!\"\nHundreds surged forward at once, their boots thundering across the planks as makeshift banners were raised to identify themselves amidst the smoke. The rest secured the southern gates, keeping the train's compartments open so reinforcements could pour in unhindered. Discipline imposed itself on the chaos—uniform after uniform spreading through the streets, while hundreds of rifles were loaded and distributed.\nWith luck, we had also cut down most of the city's mages. Many had been invited to the \"celebration\" for their political clout, but the opening cannonades had shattered their concentration. Those who tried to retaliate with spells were swept away by storms of shot. I could not afford to leave them alive—a single well-cast spell could ruin everything.\nThe organ guns were unloaded from the wagons quickly, along with barrels of powder, crates of ammunition, and provisions. Everything was calculated for a short, brutal operation. Time was against us: Marienburg was a golden prize, and soon other factions would move to protect their interests.\nIf I did not take the city within three days, my masterstroke would turn into political and military suicide.\nWinkelmarkt fell with such sudden violence it was hard to believe that minutes earlier it had been a quiet district of merchants and families. Shrapnel tore through windows, walls, and flesh alike, and when the smoke began to clear, it was already our first conquest within Marienburg.\nOnce my men confirmed they had secured the north side of the bridge—after cutting down the toll collectors—we positioned cannons to hold the assault's spearhead. Meanwhile, the dawi and others moved the empty wagons, preparing the train for immediate departure once more reinforcements arrived.\nOn the eastern flank, a small detachment secured the streets, while nearly all our force—about three thousand men—swung west. Our target: Oudgeldwijk, the city's main gateway, vital for keeping the railway open for incoming troops. It was also Marienburg's wealthiest district, and thus one of its most heavily guarded.\nIt didn't take long to meet resistance: patrols of the Black Berets and the private militias of the merchants. Hundreds of guards blocked the way, erecting hasty barricades.\n\"Bring up the Gatlings!\" I ordered. Six of my men heaved the new machines forward: crank-driven cannons, twenty-round paper cartridge feeds, engines of death that spat lead at terrifying speed.\nThe guards stood firm, convinced their numbers and discipline would hold. What they didn't know was that such discipline meant nothing here.\nThe cranks began to turn. A hailstorm of bullets spewed from the barrels. The first magazines emptied in seconds. Guards fell in waves, torn apart, bodies shredded, the walls behind them perforated like parchment. Panic consumed their ranks—many fled, others tried in vain to shield themselves.\n\"Hold the line! No looting yet!\" I barked, marching over the field of corpses. The stench of gunpowder, blood, and viscera thickened the air. The wounded cried for help, dragging themselves along, limbless, broken.\nWith Oudgeldwijk's gates broken and the tracks cleared, nothing could stop the arrival of reinforcements. The guards had sold their lives dearly, but in the end fell beneath the twin pressure of our musketeers and bayonets. The two mages who tried to rally the defense were undone by my gold-transmutation spells; while they wasted focus shielding themselves from their own flesh turning to metal, my men gunned them down. With their deaths, enemy morale collapsed.\nThe gates creaked open, and the first train rolled out empty—making way for the second convoy. Thousands of fresh soldiers poured in, though poorly armed. The initial shipment had to be split among them to hold the line. Once reorganized, we set the next target: Tempelwijk, the district of temples and Marienburg's spiritual heart.\nWith nearly seven thousand men, we marched across the bridges leading there. This time, resistance was minimal. The militias and guards, exhausted after two crushing defeats and outnumbered, surrendered en masse. The surprise came from the priests themselves, who stepped forward to halt the fighting. They persuaded the mages and militiamen to lay down their arms—not out of loyalty to us, but to save their cathedrals, dripping with gold and relics.\nThe priests offered me a sacred oath: no blade would be raised against my forces within the district, so long as I spared their temples from looting. It was a convenient pact; I accepted without hesitation. There were still too many districts left to conquer, and wasting time on a meticulous purge would only slow my advance.\nThe townsfolk hid in their homes or within the holy precincts, praying for the storm to pass. I was in no hurry to drag them out. Trials and executions would come later, once all Marienburg lay beneath my control. For now, only one thing mattered: advancing, and securing the city's vital districts.\nWe immediately began the march north, where the garrison guarding the bridge still fought with desperate ferocity. It was there that the last defenders had gathered, clinging to the position with sheer determination. The place was already a slaughterhouse: hundreds of enemy bodies lay under the devastating fire of our organ guns, while a single Gatling still roared from the top of a tower, sweeping with lethal precision every attempted counterattack.\nMy three hundred men, exhausted and bloodied, had resisted with admirable stubbornness, though at a terrible cost against the thousands trying to drive them out. But the arrival of nearly six thousand reinforcements shifted the fate of the battle at once. Pressure fell heavily on the defenders, forcing them to yield step by step.\nThe fight turned into a brutal urban war. Every building became a barricade, every street an improvised battlefield. Our musketeers exchanged fire with crossbowmen and archers shooting from balconies and windows, while suicide charges from militias and mercenaries hired by Marienburg's great families slammed into our lines. The air was thick with smoke, dust, and powder; cannon blasts and musket volleys thundered without pause, deafening all.\nThe battle in Paleisbuurt was the longest and bloodiest. They held with iron will until another of our trains arrived with reinforcements—four thousand more men, tipping the balance decisively. The artillery barrages grew ever more intense until we reached the Stadsraad, the seat of government, where the last defenders had barricaded themselves.\nOur cannons thundered with shrapnel, tearing down their defenses and reducing whole walls to rubble. The Gatlings emptied cartridge after cartridge into their positions without rest. At last, a hundred of my best soldiers, led by one of my captains, stormed the building and cleared it room by room until it was fully secured.\nThe Stadsraad—the political heart of the city—was ours. The streets around it lay devastated, a landscape of ruin and death, but control was firmly in our hands. With victory secured, we stationed garrisons in the districts already taken and received the final troop train: another four thousand men. From that point onward, the next convoys would carry only supplies—unless the enemy dared to sabotage the rails.\nWith the northern half pacified, our focus turned south, advancing on Kruiersmuur, the most populous working-class district. There we found little resistance: most militias had either concentrated at the city gates or lost their chain of command entirely. Our advance was almost peaceful, limited to silent streets where residents hid in their homes, too afraid to step outside.\nThe militiamen, faced with our overwhelming numbers, chose either surrender or flight into the outer swamps. Thus we seized the southern district and with it the river forts, securing control over the Reik's waterways.\nWith more than half of Marienburg under our dominion, I allowed myself a symbolic gesture: I ordered a great banner of the Two-Tailed Comet to be raised atop the Stadsraad, proclaiming to all that the city now belonged to the Empire.\nIn Guildervelt we met the fiercest resistance since Paleisbuurt. Much of the surviving militia had regrouped there, but their battered morale stood on one foundation alone: the dawi of Marienburg.\nMany dwarfs had taken up arms to defend the city, wielding rune-etched axes and hammers forged in workshops I knew all too well. They had joined the defenders, forming a shield wall of iron, their discipline unshakable—compact ranks, immovable as stone, resolved to hold us back to the bitter end.\nI could not allow the fight against them to turn into a massacre. The dawi were not my enemies but my natural allies, and to slaughter them in street battle would be a betrayal of the bonds I had labored so hard to forge with their clans.\nI strode forward with firm steps, deflecting with my magic the arrows and bolts raining down. Raising my voice so all could hear, I called out:\n\"Honorable dawi… I am not your enemy. On the contrary, as a son of the Empire, you are my allies. I wish you no harm. This city, ruled by traitors, must return to the rightful dominion of the Empire and of the first bearer of Ghal Maraz. I beg you, proud people of Karaz Ankor—lay down your arms, and no harm will come to you. Every loss you have suffered will be repaid in full, I swear it as dawongi of Clan Grundkaraz of the Grey Mountains.\"\nA tense silence followed, broken only by the clash of shields and the distant roar of battle. The defenders watched in dread, waiting to see if the dwarfs would hold the line. Slowly, the dawi began to lower their weapons. They turned back to their workshops and homes, refusing to spill blood in vain.\nTheir withdrawal exposed the human defenders. Without their wall of iron, the line began to buckle.\n\"No artillery here. Muskets only, and take care not to destroy what need not be destroyed,\" I ordered, holding back heavy fire as we reformed our lines.\nThe dawi withdrew from Marienburg's war, and the defenders, bereft of their living bulwark, began to falter. Guildervelt was doomed to fall.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.Thɪs\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

That allowed us to slaughter the guards who fled seeking refuge, but it also became a problem. The walls were now bristling with elven archers and human spearmen, ready to hold to the end.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nThe elves were a particular obstacle. I could not afford to annihilate them. Doing so would mean provoking the wrath of the Phoenix King and, without doubt, that of the Emperor himself. What I was doing in Marienburg was already grave enough, but adding an elven massacre could cut off trade with Altdorf entirely and plunge the Empire into a political maelstrom. After all, the spoils of Marienburg's merchants might placate the court's anger, but the fury of Ulthuan would not be so easily soothed.\nFor that reason, I sent one of my most trusted men, a personal guard, to parley with the elves. His message was clear: they would keep all their rights, privileges, and political standing if they accepted the change of government and recognized Marienburg's annexation to the Empire. I could not appear in person; I was certain among them there was a mage capable of seeing too much in me—and in the amulet I carried.\nThe minutes of negotiation dragged on like hours. Finally, the elves yielded. They descended from the walls in silence and returned to their tasks, abandoning the human defenders. Those men no longer mattered. My soldiers had orders to ignore them unless they tried something foolish, since a stray shot could send an elf to the grave—and that was a risk I could not take.\nWith Elftown neutralized, enemy morale collapsed. The rest of the city began to fall like dominoes. There was hardly any resistance in the following districts: the human defenders had lost all hope, leaving only the central island, used as a prison.\nI made my way to the city's treasury. The very thought of what might lie inside made me smile. The most coveted city in the Old World, now under my control, had to contain unimaginable riches. I walked with the certainty that I had achieved one of the greatest victories in the Empire's history.\nBut before I could enter, a soldier burst in, panting, his eyes wide with terror.\"My lord… in the Suiddock…\"\n\"What is it, soldier?\" I asked, calm while he struggled to breathe.\n\"The dead… they are rising. Something is calling them. Hundreds of zombies and skeletons have appeared, and… and a huge beast.\"\n\"Damnation… a necromancer,\" I muttered through clenched teeth.\n\"Not only that,\" the soldier went on, horrified. \"Demons, my lord… red demons in the Suiddock. They're fighting the dead.\"\nFor a heartbeat, the world stopped.\"Demons?\" I growled in fury. \"Here?\" Then I raised my voice so all could hear.\"Everyone to your posts! The Ruinous Powers have come to test our mettle. Contact the local cults—bring the priests of Ulric and Sigmar. May Morr bless our steps. And summon the Witch Hunters—we'll need every last one.\"\nWe marched south immediately. Chaos reigned in the Suiddock. A burning portal hung in the air, spewing forth terrifying numbers of Khorne's daemons. Yet somewhere in the city the necromancer too was at work, raising the dead by the thousands. The entire harbor had become a nightmare: zombies and skeletons hurling themselves against roaring daemons that tore them apart endlessly.\nIt was impossible to say which was worse. The ground shook under the stampede of daemons, but at the same time, the corpses of fallen civilians rose ceaselessly, swelling the necromancer's ranks. I could feel his dark magic—a sea of Dhar spreading like poison through every street. But for the moment, he was a \"temporary ally,\" his hordes holding back the daemons at least.\nWe placed the repeating cannons and organ guns in strategic positions. The priests of Morr began blessing corpses to deny them to necromancy, while the priests of Ulric and Sigmar joined our lines. The Witch Hunters, having heard the word \"daemons,\" came at once, rallying beneath my banner with fanatical zeal.\nAmid the wreckage, I saw a colossal beast of bone tearing daemons apart with its claws. Beside it fought a vampire, commanding the undead legions with chilling calm. The destruction was total: Suiddock was engulfed in fire and blood, its civilian population nearly erased.\nI sent messengers to the dawi, begging for reinforcements. The elves would not lift a finger unless the disaster threatened to consume us all. Time was against us. The daemons poured through the portal in endless waves, and though the vampire held the line, he was beginning to falter.\nThis was the moment. Taking advantage of the brief respite the two enemy forces gave us, I gathered all my men. I ordered every organ gun, every repeater cannon, every piece of artillery ready. When the vampire began to fall back under Khorne's pressure, I gave the command: open fire on the daemon tide.\nThe repeaters spewed shrapnel without pause, shredding scores of daemons before they came close. Lines of Bloodletters and Flesh Hounds surged from the portal, trampling even the necromancer's remaining dead. As they bled against each other, our artillery thinned the survivors who pressed forward.\nThe first waves tried to climb into the upper city, but the organ guns thundered from our positions, obliterating entire ranks of hounds and lesser daemons. The bridges burned with embers and smoke, and as they reached musket range, three ranks of musketeers unleashed coordinated volleys that swept down even more.\nThen came the abominations: shapeless amalgams of flesh and bone, massive and relentless. They needed the concentrated fire of dozens of weapons to banish them from the world, slowing our defense to the breaking point.\nThe priest of Sigmar, standing in the front line, raised his hammer, glowing with golden light.\"As Sigmar crushed the servants of Chaos at the dawn of the Empire, so too shall these corrupt ones fall today!\" he roared, and his energy spread through my men, steeling their courage for the inevitable: close combat.\nThe first Flesh Hounds reached us. Some were impaled mid-leap on bayonets, others tore through armor before being felled by powder and blade. I myself cut the head from one that lunged at my guards and drove my rune-etched sword through the skull of another—just as a Bloodletter barred my path.\nOur blades clashed in a shower of sparks. Its every strike was a precise, murderous blow. We pushed against each other until I drove my boot into its knee, forcing it to stagger. I twisted my sword and severed its head in a swift motion, wasting no time.\nAnother daemon struck at me instantly, while a hound's burning jaws clamped around my leg. The gromril held, though the crushing bite made me falter. I twisted aside the Bloodletter's axe, and when it leapt at me, I thrust upward, skewering it from belly to spine. Its weapon clipped my helm, a sharp crack I barely felt thanks to the runes' protection.\nI spun, cleaved another hound in two, and rushed to aid one of my guards, locked in desperate struggle with a daemon. Driving my blade into its gut, together we brought it down until it unraveled into red smoke.\nAround us, cannons still thundered, tearing apart whole waves before they reached the walls. But our losses grew: men with legs shredded by bites, others barely clinging to life after taking daemonsteel cuts. The wounded were dragged to the cathedral of Shallya, while the rest of us braced the infernal onslaught.\nThe battle dragged on for what felt like an eternity. The portal kept spewing daemons, though fewer each time. The necromantic forces were nearly annihilated: the colossal bone beast lay shattered, and the remnants of zombies and skeletons crumbled as the necromancer who raised them was slain or fled.\nThe daemon horde, with no other foes to spend their fury on, turned fully against us. A tide of fangs and burning blades smashed into our lines. Among them I saw one bearing a sword wreathed in fire—a champion, marked by his infernal master's favor.\nThe order was immediate. All artillery roared again, hurling shot into the advancing tide. The ranks of musketeers fired without pause, cutting down scores. Still, Bloodletters and Flesh Hounds broke through, crashing into our first line in a whirlwind of blood and steel.\nThe priests of Ulric and Sigmar never ceased their cries, raising our spirits as the battle became a hell of shattered bodies and choking smoke. Witch Hunters charged with stakes and consecrated blades, fighting shoulder to shoulder with my soldiers.\nI carved my way through the host, driving back daemon after daemon with my rune-blade, unable to stand idle while my men died. Then the fire-sworded champion leveled his blade at me, issuing a challenge.\nI accepted without hesitation. Amid the cacophony of cannon fire, musket volleys, and death screams, we met head-on. The creature struck with ferocious strength, each swing blazing like a furnace, executed with the skill of a veteran of endless wars. Every blow was a torrent of fire; I barely kept pace, deflecting his strikes and forcing distance with the flat of my blade, the heat scorching even through gromril.\nAt times he circled, measuring me like a patient predator. Then he lunged with renewed fury, his burning sword slicing arcs through the air. I countered with steady blocks, turning my body to keep balance, as sparks showered my armor.\nThe duel stretched into a deadly dance. The clash of steel rang with the roar of battle all around. We both knew one mistake would end it.\nAt last, I turned aside a high strike, but the daemon slammed his fist into my face. The force whipped my head aside; regaining focus, I saw him lunging, blade aimed for my ribs. The fiery steel struck my breastplate—yet the runes flared, deflecting the thrust. In that instant, I swung for his neck.\nHis eyes widened at the rune's glow. He smiled, feral—then his head rolled, dissolving into fiery smoke as his body unraveled to nothing.\nI collapsed, dragging myself back. \"Damn… that was… close…\" I muttered, forcing myself to rise and rejoin the fray.\nThe fight grew easier until the portal ceased vomiting daemons. We descended into the ruins of Suiddock—now nothing but wreckage and broken corpses—while the priests began their rites to seal the breach.\nWhen the daemon champion fell to my blade, the Sigmarite priest bellowed as though the god himself filled his lungs. His hammer shone with a blinding golden light; raising it skyward, divine power lanced into the portal, snapping it shut with a thunderclap. In an instant, Khorne's host vanished like smoke on the wind.\nThere was no time to celebrate. The priests of Sigmar and Ulric immediately set to purifying the corrupted ground, consecrating it anew with each prayer. The reek of Chaos began to ebb.\nUnder my command, the Witch Hunters were given full authority. I ordered constant patrols and decreed that any man or woman suspected of serving the Ruinous Powers be seized or burned—if there was proof or at least strong cause. We could no longer afford cracks in our defenses.\nThe next hour became a relentless hunt. Soldiers and Witch Hunters scoured every street, workshop, and abandoned house. At last we found them: a large coven of cultists gathered in the southern worker's district, raising crude altars and chanting mid-ritual to Tzeentch. Had we arrived a moment later, another portal would have torn open—and this time not even our artillery could have saved us.\nThe cultists were slaughtered before their ceremony could be completed. The priests' purifying fire reduced their symbols and scrolls to ash, and the threat was smothered.\nWatching the smoke rise from their bodies, I could not shake the thought of how close we had come to ruin. If the vampire had not drawn the daemons' attention… if the portal had not been sealed in time… Marienburg might already lie in ashes beneath the claws of Chaos.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

At least I can take solace in knowing we saved this damned city from the forces of Chaos,\" I said, lying on the ground, exhausted, every muscle knotted after throwing my life into the frontlines.\n\"Well… it seems you're free of all taint. It looks like Sigmar shields you well, son of the Empire,\" the priest replied, slowly withdrawing the golden light that illuminated my body.\n\"I have frequent visions of the twin-tailed comet, and I believe they are true, honorable servant of our god. He showed me that I had to come to Marienburg to settle accounts. If I did, it would aid the Empire,\" I answered, forcing myself to sit among the corpses still strewn across the ground.\n\"Settle accounts?\" the Sigmarite priest asked, raising his brows.\n\"The corrupt merchants of this city had struck a deal with me over the railways… but I received a letter one day before arriving, informing me that all my holdings in Marienburg had been seized to cover supposed damages from a previous conflict. The message should have reached me after the inauguration, but the messenger came early. Thanks to that, I discovered their scheme… and on my way here, another vision showed me the city overrun by daemons. I understood I had to act before it was too late,\" I said, rising with effort.\n\"Fortunately, Sigmar deems you His messenger. But much remains to be done. This corrupt city, which abandoned the patron god it once revered, must be brought back into the fold. The cult of Sigmar must know that Marienburg is once again Imperial, and that this farce of independence is over,\" the priest declared solemnly.\n\"I know. But first I must review certain information and bring it with that message. Even though everything turned out well, if I don't present evidence to the Emperor, I'll find myself in serious trouble,\" I replied as I made my way toward the palace district.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on\nThe priests of Morr were already at work in the streets, conducting burials and shielding bodies with sacred rites to prevent them from rising again. Many of my men assisted them, for we did not want the vampire returning to raise corpses left unprotected. The stench of death clung to the city.\nWhen I reached the government palace, every part of me screamed to head straight for the treasury—where Chamon called to me with burning insistence—but I knew I had to first control the narrative, or else face harsh punishment.\nIt did not take long to find several administrative clerks hiding in the corridors, survivors of the carnage. My men also combed through the personal palaces of Marienburg's ruling houses, dragging out attendants and family members still alive.\nIn short order, I gathered a score of scribes, assistants, and district representatives. For years they had written letters for their lords, imitating their handwriting, style, and even their seals. That was my great advantage: I could fabricate evidence as if it had come from the hands of the Directorate itself.\n\"In consideration of the damages caused during the commercial conflicts, the city of Marienburg will henceforth seize all railways and trains belonging to Albrech von Reinfelds, until the monetary losses have been covered,\" I dictated to the chief scribe, who wrote nervously while I paced before him.\n\"For the sum of twenty-five thousand Bretonnian gold coins, the passage of Bretonnian ships and forces through Imperial territory will be allowed, aiding their attacks and joining them in case of victory, with the intent of seizing lands in Reikland,\" I added, dictating the missive that had to appear as if written by Jaan van de Kuypers. The patriarch's assistant perfumed the paper with his master's customary scent and sealed it with the precise wax his lord used.\nI continued dictating. Letters revealing conspiracies with rebels in Altdorf, inciting internal revolts. Others exposing secret agreements with Bretonnian mercenaries, plans to strike the Empire, even promises to provide troops for future invasions.\nWe also forged trade ledgers, weaving the tale that Imperial citizens had been systematically kidnapped and sold as slaves to the Norse.\nSoon the web was woven. A chain of correspondence and \"authentic\" evidence condemning Marienburg's Directorate as the Empire's greatest traitors.\n\"Enough… enough… I will not be the one to tarnish the honor of our city,\" said one of the scribes, from a once-powerful house now without a lord.\n\"Are you certain?\" I asked, staring at him, the only Imperial in that room surrounded by them.\n\"No… I will not—\" he began, before I blew his brains out with a single shot. The echo of the gunfire filled the hall, and the muffled screams of the others rang out as they looked at me in terror.\n\"Anyone else eager to be next? I told you—your lives depend on your cooperation. By your obedience, I will decide your fate. Now work, you wretches,\" I growled at the group, who shakily took up their quills again and resumed writing the incriminating letters.\nNight fell over Marienburg as they continued writing just as they had for their former masters, producing hundreds of missives and dozens of contraband ledgers.\n\"They look too new… I need to make them seem like someone tried to destroy them,\" I muttered, breaking wax seals, crumpling parchments, burning edges, and smudging some with soot, until everything bore the appearance of having been salvaged from ash and shattered cinders.\nThus we spent hours. I worked silently among them, forging a mountain of false evidence that would grant me the moral authority I needed to justify my assault. It had all begun with a train—my train—which the Directorate had tried to seize. That was a direct attack against the Empire and against the dawi, and it would be enough to have their names inscribed in the Dammazkron.\nIf I told the tale that the letter had reached me by mistake before the celebration, and that thanks to that twist of fate I discovered their treachery, I could present myself as one who acted by Sigmar's command, not out of self-interest. Even more so, with my visions of the twin-tailed comet as my divine witness.\nAt dawn, I had fabricated so much evidence that no Elector Count—nor even the Emperor himself—would doubt its authenticity. The letters were flawless, identical in style and handwriting, reinforced with stains, creases, broken seals, and even invisible ink made with citric acid to simulate secrets revealed only under heat. No one could ever uncover the lie.\n\"Good… very good… this will be our little secret. Everything you wrote, no one else shall know. So I thank you for cooperating with my plan. We twenty are the only ones who know what happened here. It is our secret,\" I said, raising the fragments of metal scattered across the hall with my magic.\n\"But as you well know… twenty can keep a secret, if nineteen are dead. And I do not intend to be one of them. Still, I assure you—you shall enter Morr's gardens as is fitting, thanks to your collaboration,\" I added with a cold smile.\nThe shards of metal shot forward, piercing the foreheads of the scribes one by one, dropping them like puppets with their strings cut. Some tried to flee, but only made it a few steps before death caught them.\nThe hall fell silent, covered in bodies and papers that would now serve as the foundation of my perfect alibi.\nWith hundreds of letters and dozens of ledgers prepared, while most of the city slept, I placed them throughout the directors' palaces. I wanted it so that, should any of my men ever speak, they could only swear that they had truly found those proofs there.\nAfter more than an hour of work in the early dawn, everything was ready. I ordered that all documents \"found\" in the palace district be gathered: falsified ledgers mixed with authentic ones, invented letters alongside real correspondence. Everything fit perfectly, as though it had always been there.\nFinally, after a day of endless blood and steel, I sent messengers by train to Altdorf to report what had happened. Then I allowed myself barely two hours of sleep before returning to my duties.\nUpon waking, I gave the order to begin the systematic sacking of the city. But it would not be indiscriminate: I spared the middle and lower classes, for they had not led the treachery. All wrath would fall upon the elites—the merchants who had orchestrated the secession. They would pay for their ambition.\nMy soldiers stormed the mansions of wealthy merchants and artisans. Only the dawi and elves were spared retribution. The rest could weep as much as they wished—I did not care.\nThe treasury was full, yes, but not nearly as much as I had expected. I found millions in gold coins, but not the tens of millions that a city as coveted as Marienburg should have accumulated. The true hoard lay in the banks: vaults overflowing with gold and silver, which we emptied until the chests nearly burst.\nIn the house of Jaan van de Kuypers, I discovered something else. A hidden vault protected by a complex security system—useless against my mastery of Chamon. In seconds I had the heavy door open. Inside was such a mountain of gold and silver ingots that for a moment I was speechless.\nBut the greatest treasure was not the metal, but the account books. There they were: personal loans to half the world. The Emperor… the King of Bretonnia… cities of Estalia and Tilea… Kislev… even several Elector Counts.\n\"Damn… that's why no one ever dared act against Marienburg. Half the world owed this bastard,\" I muttered, leafing through the records.\nJaan's cunning was clear. He had scattered his fortune across multiple ports and cities, each with vaults like this. His enterprises, spread across every sea, lay beyond my reach unless the states themselves recognized the annexation of Marienburg. Otherwise, each power would claim its piece of this merchant's corpse.\nBut Jaan was dead, one of the first to fall to shrapnel. And with him, his empire had been left an orphan.\n\"Now I am the richest man in the world,\" I said softly, closing the ledgers firmly. The oldest business of all had smiled upon me—war.\n\"I will have to give a portion to the dawi, for I acted in defense of our shared interests, and their claim is rightful. Another portion to the Emperor, to maintain his favor. And perhaps a fraction to the Elector Count of Nordland, to purchase his rights over the city… of course, if he is willing. If he attempts to reclaim it by force, it will be more complicated. But so long as the cult of Sigmar supports me, I will be safe.\"\nThe city would not rest easy yet. The sack had been only the beginning. Now came the purge of all who had collaborated with Marienburg's treason.\nThose who had lost everything to my soldiers were captured without delay. Dragged into dark alleys, bound with rough cords, tied to wooden posts like cattle awaiting judgment.\nI stepped forward, my voice firm:\"For your treason against Deus Sigmar, and for collaborating with the traitor city by trading under its secessionist banner, I declare you guilty. The sentence is death—by firing squad.\"\nThe musketeers formed a line before the condemned. A sepulchral silence fell over the street. Only the ragged breaths of the prisoners, broken whispers of prayers, and the scrape of metal as soldiers raised their weapons could be heard.\n\"Ready… aim… fire!\" The thunder of muskets echoed between the walls. The bodies fell like rag dolls, held upright only by the ropes that bound them. Blood seeped into the wooden boards beneath, and the stench of burnt powder filled the air.\n\"Next.\" Guards brought forward the next group: artisans, merchants, bureaucrats. All with vacant eyes, some weeping, others with faces hardened by fear or resignation.\nOnce again, I repeated the words of condemnation with the same calm:\"For your treason against Deus Sigmar, and for collaborating with the traitor city by trading under its secessionist banner, I declare you guilty. The sentence is death—by firing squad.\"\nThe echo of the shots shook the street once more, and another row of traitors collapsed. The pile of corpses grew ever higher.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------\nSo, what do you think about the story so far?",

There are too many wizards and Grail Knights, and the number of Pegasus riders in the region makes it nearly impossible to carry out new maneuvers. The general is facing serious problems, especially as the greenskins descend from the mountains and attack our supply caravans,\" said one of the Reiksguard knights as he read the report on the situation in the west.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n\"How many reinforcements are needed to hold Montfort? We cannot afford to lose that fortress. Next year we will launch the real offensive,\" I replied thoughtfully, looking for a way to contain the Bretonnians without having to send our own wizards to the front.\n\"My Emperor, at least four thousand reinforcements are required, preferably armed with black powder weapons. That is the only thing that has managed to stop the massive cavalry charges. Our attempts to advance have been decimated by them,\" the knight answered.\n\"Ah… damn it, why is it so difficult for them? The Graf of Reinsfeld achieved victories despite being clearly outnumbered, and now, with a full army sent in support, all we hear are misfortunes,\" I replied bitterly, convinced that this campaign against Bretonnia was proving to be a mistake: the costs far outweighed the benefits.\n\"We still hold Parravon, Majesty. That was a valuable conquest,\" added one of my advisors.\n\"Yes, but it is not the same as Montfort and its gold mines. Parravon offers little more than manpower and population. The general should have marched north instead of south, securing both passes into the Empire. We know that sooner or later more Bretonnian knights will attempt to raid Reikland if given the chance. Speaking of which… what news do we have about the weapons order in Nuln?\" I asked another of my advisors.\n\"On schedule, my Emperor. We have been assured that the next shipment of weaponry to sustain the war will soon arrive,\" he replied.\n\"Excellent. We must gather everything possible, because if conditions remain the same, next year we can send two armies the same size as the current one, with the help of the electors… perhaps even more. Has there been an increase in recruitment?\" I asked one of the Reiksguard spies.\n\"Considerable, my lord. All the electors and provinces have begun mass recruitment. There should be no shortage of men for a major offensive in Bretonnia,\" the knight assured me.\n\"Good. If everything goes as planned, we will secure the mountain passes and, at least for a time, no longer have to worry about Bretonnian incursions,\" I said, raising a hand to my forehead.\n\"By the way, how is my son? I have not seen him for days,\" I asked.\n\"The prince is well, Majesty. He has simply devoted himself with greater fervor to his training. His tutors have also intensified his lessons, so he is busier than usual,\" an advisor replied.\n\"Good… I think I will—\" my words were interrupted by a knight who burst into the hall, nearly smashing the door.\n\"The Graf Albrecht has attacked Marienburg!\" he announced breathlessly.\n\"What? What in the hell has he done?\" I shouted, incredulous.\n\"Yes, your Majesty. The Graf launched an attack against Marienburg. I do not know his reasons, but one of his messengers has just arrived to inform us,\" said the knight, trying to catch his breath.\n\"He had better not dare close river traffic! I will not face another army of disgruntled merchants. He is to cease all hostilities immediately; we are in no condition for a new conflict with them,\" I replied furiously.\n\"Eh… my lord…\" The knight hesitated, unsure how to deliver the news.\n\"What?\" I pressed him, fixing my eyes on him.\n\"The city has already fallen. The Graf controls Marienburg. It has returned to the Imperial yoke,\" he said, still hardly believing his own words.\n\"What…? Ah… summon… summon… summon the electors at once. We must avoid the chaos that is coming…\" I murmured, barely able to get the words out.\n\"The Graf Albrecht requests that a large contingent of priests of Sigmar and witch hunters be sent. In the city they discovered a vampire necromancer, and a daemonic portal was opened. They also captured numerous cults operating within. He will soon send a full report with the information,\" concluded the knight.\nIn the following hours everything was a whirlwind of emotions and events. The electors of Wissenland, Middenland, and Middenheim were already in Altdorf, so they were informed of the situation—and all were as stunned as I was to learn that Marienburg had fallen in a single day.\nBut that in itself was not the most important matter. Who knew how much damage had been done to the city, or whether anything remained standing? If there had been a necromancer and a Chaos portal, the entire city must have been devastated… I still struggled to understand what had driven Albrecht to do something so reckless, putting the entire political balance at risk.\nWhile we were already speaking with the electors about what to do to punish the Graf, another messenger from him arrived, bringing enormous quantities of evidence obtained from the city… all pointing to possible financing of rebellion and collaboration with our enemies in Bretonnia.\nAnd the cause that provoked the Graf's attack—that they had attempted to confiscate his properties… his strike had been legitimate. Which only complicated matters further.\nI had much of those letters examined, suspecting possible forgery… but when it was confirmed to me that the handwriting was identical and the wax seals legitimate… everything indicated that Marienburg had indeed been plotting to create an uprising in Altdorf. We now had the names of those leaders and the location of their hiding places. The evidence was overwhelming… and it was clear they had tried and failed to destroy the information, as many of the documents were half-burned.\nIt seemed we had narrowly escaped disaster.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Trade must resume as soon as possible, or the city will suffer grave consequences from this disaster,\" I said as I looked over the chaos of Suiddock.\n\"We still have to deal with Rijker's Isle, my lord. The garrison guards have not surrendered, and Marienburg's fleet remains under whoever commands the resistance. For now, they show no intention of capitulating,\" reported one of my captains.\n\"But they haven't fired their cannons either, which is a good sign. They won't bombard their own city unless they are desperate. Besides, many of the warships are already under our control. With vessels that weren't expecting a war, how long can they last? Days? Weeks? Perhaps a month. Sooner or later they will realize they no longer have a city to supply them. The same goes for the island: only jailers remain there, and without supplies they will eventually surrender,\" I replied, gazing toward the islands and the ships blocking the harbor.\n\"We could force them to surrender using the city's captured ships,\" one of my bodyguards suggested.\n\"No. That would be too risky; no one here knows how to handle them properly, and we would lose many men against experienced crews. Place cannons in positions where we can sink them if they come too close. The repeater cannons should be able to pierce their hulls if we land a good shot,\" I ordered, pointing to northern and southern sectors where the artillery should be deployed.\nMy men nodded and began setting up the cannons. Just a few volleys of artillery were enough to drive the warships back to other Marienburg naval bases. The blockade was broken, at least for now.\nIt wasn't long before the men on the prison island lowered Marienburg's flag and replaced it with a white one, asking to negotiate. It was a welcome development, as it meant taking one of the most important river fortresses.\nI seized the opportunity and sent a ship. It returned minutes later with the prison guards, who had surrendered without resistance. The garrison commander had checked the stores and realized there weren't enough provisions to withstand a siege. They had no other choice.\nI immediately investigated whether the jailers had ties to any important Marienburg families. With the exception of the commander, none belonged to significant lineages; they were just common recruits. Thus, ironically, that commander became one of the few important bureaucrats of the city to survive.\nWith much of the city secured, I sent six thousand men north in two groups to seize the coastal towns where the rest of Marienburg's navy was likely hiding. With around ten thousand soldiers I remained to defend the city, while the witch hunters searched every street, every house, for hidden cults.\nAt last, one of Altdorf's trains arrived laden with clergy of the Cult of Sigmar. Dozens of Sigmarite priests disembarked, accompanied by witch hunters. At the forefront came the Arch-Lector of Reikland, his brow furrowed.\n\"Arch-Lector, it is an honor to have you here,\" I said, shaking his hand.\n\"Servant of Sigmar… once more you serve the interests of our god,\" he answered in solemn voice, with an unexpected warmth in his gesture.\n\"The city is secured for now. We found cultists performing rituals, though we have no doubt there are more. The local priest of Sigmar and one of Ulric worked together to seal the portal that spewed demons into the city. We managed to contain it… but the damage was great,\" I reported immediately.\n\"So I have heard, young Graf. And the necromancer? Did you manage to capture him?\" asked the Arch-Lector.\n\"No. We saw him fighting against the demons at the docks, but when the horde vanished he had already disappeared. We believe he fled the city. We searched Suiddock's warehouses and only found desecrated graves and mass pits, prepared to raise thousands of corpses at once,\" I answered.\n\"All of this happening under the noses of those traitorous heretics…\" muttered the Arch-Lector with contempt. \"But at least order has been restored. Even so, the Cult wishes to discuss certain matters with you at once, before the situation develops further.\"\n\"Follow me, I know a place where we can speak without interruptions… and away from the blood that still stains the streets,\" I replied, leading him to Jaan's mansion, once the wealthiest man of Marienburg, now under my possession.\n\"Tell me, Arch-Lector, what does the Cult want of me? I suppose this comes from the Grand Theogonist himself,\" I said, taking a seat and gesturing to a chair for him.\n\"As you know, the rightful lord of the city is Duke Theoderic Gausser. However, the Cult would prefer to see a Sigmarite noble who reconquered it at the forefront, rather than an Ulrican. We wish to know your thoughts, and whether you would be willing to cooperate in this matter,\" he answered gravely.\n\"Certainly I know who holds the right by blood… but I also know that I hold it by conquest. The city is valuable, and I am tempted to add new lands to my domains. Lands that will once again honor Sigmar with villages and temples dedicated to our patron god,\" I replied with a smile.\n\"An interesting proposal, from what I hear… The Cult will support any debate that arises regarding the city's possession. However, we require that Sigmar's authority be reestablished here, especially considering that in the past this city confiscated many of our temples and handed them to other cults to raise their own churches. It would be prudent to demand their immediate return, to send a clear message: Marienburg once again serves Sigmar,\" declared the Arch-Lector firmly.\n\"Indeed, the damage inflicted by Marienburg's heretic merchants in confiscating the Cult of Sigmar's properties must be remedied. Consider it done. I suppose that if we reclaim the cathedral of Handrich, it would serve as a fitting point for the Cult's rebirth in the city,\" I said, glancing at the Arch-Lector.\n\"Yes, that was one of our properties before it was seized and demolished to build a heretic temple of the merchants. But not only that: we also demand the cathedral of Mannan. Part of its construction stands on lands that belonged to the Cult of Sigmar, and we deem it just that they be returned to us in full,\" the Arch-Lector replied sternly.\n\"Wouldn't that create friction with the Cult of Mannan, Arch-Lector?\" I asked with interest, weighing the move.\n\"They are as guilty of rebellion as the followers of Handrich. It is only just that they be punished for supporting the separation of this territory from the Empire of Sigmar. Casting those rats into the streets is the least they deserve,\" the Arch-Lector replied, his combative tone leaving no room for doubt.\n\"In that case, I will raise no objections. I will see to it that many of my men accompany your priests in the recovery of those rightful possessions that were confiscated. And I expect your support in any debate regarding the future of the city, Arch-Lector, for there is no one better suited than I to be its protector. After all, I am the only one with the means to defend Marienburg from the Chaos that consumed it just days ago,\" I concluded, returning the firm gaze of the Cult's representative.\n\"We are grateful for your support, Graf Albrecht. Let us hope that soon I may address you by a loftier title. But for now, this city must be placed under absolute control. I assume you will not oppose the witch hunters operating at the fullest extent of their authority?\" asked the Arch-Lector.\n\"So long as they present evidence, the witch hunters may judge all the city's inhabitants, as many as necessary. With a Chaos portal having opened so recently, I have no qualms about restoring peace with a firm hand. I also request that, if possible, they examine my men for the Mark of Chaos. Only a handful were carefully inspected by the local priest, and I want to be certain of them all,\" I answered gravely, meeting the Arch-Lector's eyes.\n\"I will see to it. None bearing the mark of the Ruinous Powers will remain standing in this city. You have my word, Graf Albrecht: Marienburg shall be a shining example of Sigmar's purity and of our holy mission in the struggle against Chaos from this day forward,\" the Arch-Lector replied before rising and leaving the mansion to begin his work.\nThe following days unfolded as I had planned. Broekwater, Almshoven, and Fort Solace fell with barely any resistance, secured by my troops the Marienburg navy was incapable of mounting a solid defense. Fort Hollum and the town of Aarnau were also taken, along with all villages and hamlets along the way, leaving the north of the Wastelands under my control. Just in time, for forces from the Elector Count of Nordland soon appeared, attempting to cross the border to seize the towns—though they arrived too late.\nAmidst the witch hunters' pyres and their constant trials, I finally managed to free men from garrison duty in the city and send them south to secure the swamp villages and, most importantly, demand the surrender of Fort Bergbres. There the situation was more complicated: the commander and officers were members of the great houses that had proclaimed themselves leaders of the Republic of Marienburg, alongside merchants who had fled the city and sought to regroup in order to reclaim it.\nBut the garrison had other plans. The next day, the lifeless bodies of those commanders were thrown toward our lines. The garrison surrendered entirely, unwilling to starve in a hopeless siege.\nThus, Marienburg and the Wastelands fell fully under my control.\nYet there was little immediate profit to be had. The witch hunters' purges, combined with urban combat and the devastation wrought by the vampire and the Ruinous Powers, had left the city gravely scarred. Marienburg, a city that once housed nearly two hundred thousand souls, had lost tens of thousands. I estimated the dead numbered in the tens of thousands—between political purges, religious trials, and the battles against Chaos corruption. And many of those who remained were not even Imperials: they hailed from foreign cities, ports of the Old World, and even from the far east, from Cathay and beyond.\nThe city, for the time being, stood calm—though not truly at peace. Many merchants who had escaped—or simply been abroad when the city fell—now proclaimed themselves \"Directors of Marienburg,\" and, according to my somewhat reliable sources, were beginning to hire mercenary companies with the intent of retaking it. It was clear that, though the streets were quiet, the city's future remained uncertain, and it could once again become a battlefield.\nAs for me, the work was endless. I had to tally the gold seized in the conquest, reorganize the tax records, and prepare the ground for trade to flow again once the ports were repaired. Without respite, the days passed in reconstruction, mountains of paperwork, and the first official complaints from priests of various cults, enraged that the Cult of Sigmar had seized the city's most important cathedrals.\nThe witch hunters' investigations only deepened the tensions: many priests were accused of corruption, suspected of bearing the mark of Chaos, or even of vampirism. The pyres began to burn fiercely, sending a clear message that heresy and disorder would never again take root here.\nAt the same time, my men fought in the shadows against the remnants of Marienburg's smuggling bands. Those rats still tried to reclaim their old \"normality,\" but we hunted them down one by one. Their bodies were hung from the city's bridges as a warning: the corrupt system that had ruled under the Directorate was finished, and their treachery would no longer be tolerated. For years they had endangered the Empire by trafficking cursed items and forbidden relics, filling their pockets without caring about the consequences. Now, the tap had been shut off forever.\nBetween executions, trials, and reconstruction, time slipped through my fingers. But at last, I received my official summons to the Volkshalle, into the presence of the Emperor himself.\n-----------------------------New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

As soon as I finish calculating expenses, I'll send payment to Durán; make sure to let him know when you return to the mountains, please,\" I added.\n\"Understood, dawongi,\" the engineer replied, focusing once more on his task.\nI gripped one of the bars and stepped outside to watch. The landscape blurred away behind us. The train must have been going at least eighty kilometers per hour, though without a speedometer it was impossible to be sure. All I saw were forests cut through by the tracks, palisades, and watchtowers every few stretches flashing past as we advanced.\n\"The other train,\" I muttered as I saw it approach. It roared past us, hauling dozens of empty cargo wagons back toward Reinsfeld.\nThe journey continued in calm, though from time to time I caught sight of beastmen attacking some of the towers. Nothing the garrisons couldn't handle. After several hours, we arrived in Altdorf. My men-at-arms and personal guard accompanied me. We disembarked immediately, for an audience awaited us in the Volkshalle, where it would be decided whether the Emperor considered my action in Marienburg a crime… or a service to the Empire.\nKnights of the Reiksguard flanked my way. I wore my gromril armor and carried my helmet under my arm. We entered the antechamber, and from there the shouts of heated debate reached us: the electors were arguing fiercely inside.\n\"The city is mine. I am the prince of Marienburg! The historical right to those lands belongs to me. This should not even be up for debate,\" cried the Grand Baron of Nordland at the central table, surrounded by the other prince-electors and nobles of the Empire.\nEvery seat was taken, and as I entered I felt their eyes fix on me. Slowly, I turned my head, meeting each gaze until my eyes rested on the main table. There sat the Grand Theogonist, flanked by the Arch-Lectors of the east and south, both holding the right to vote. They exchanged glances when they noticed my presence.\n\"Chosen of Sigmar,\" proclaimed the Grand Theogonist, \"before any decision is made in this audience with the Imperial noble Albrecht von Reinsfeld, I declare before all the great lords of the Empire that our god, Sigmar, has blessed his enterprise. Unanimously, the Cult recognizes that the lands of the former province of the Westerlands belong to him in perpetuity, returning them at once to the Empire under the custody of the one who rescued the heretic city of Marienburg.\"\n\"You have lost your minds!\" roared the Grand Baron of Nordland, furious. \"Those lands are mine by right. We never recognized the independence of those traitors. To hand them over to this upstart is an outrageous insult!\"\n\"The Empire faces dark times. War and ruin assail us from all sides. Cities of strategic importance must be in the hands of those capable of ruling and defending them. And at this moment, there is no one better than Graf Albrecht, who brought Marienburg, that rebellious city which caused the Empire so much harm with its constant insubordination, back into the fold,\" countered the Grand Theogonist, ignoring the count.\n\"Wise words, Grand Theogonist,\" the Emperor interrupted. \"But we are not here to distribute lands just yet. This audience with the Graf is, first and foremost, to hear his explanations regarding what transpired in Marienburg, not to determine titles or rights immediately.\"\n\"Graf Albrecht,\" continued the Emperor, fixing his gaze on me, \"can you explain what led you to make such a drastic decision against that city?\"\n\"I believe everything is clear enough in the evidence I provided to Your Majesty. The Directorate of Marienburg attempted to confiscate my holdings as punishment for attacking their merchant ships. Their plan was to time it with the inauguration of the railway, but a messenger arrived early. Instead of wheat and provisions, which was the cargo the city expected, I sent men and arms to teach them a lesson. That was their fatal mistake. I only acted in defense and arrived just in time to contain the daemonic invasion and face the vampire necromancer that was unleashed,\" I replied calmly, casting a glance at the dignitaries of the Cult of Sigmar.\n\"It seems too much of a coincidence that everything ended up benefiting you. You did not exaggerate the facts, did you?\" the Grand Baron of Nordland retorted with hostility.\n\"I do not control my enemies' mistakes,\" I answered with a faint smile. \"They sought to humiliate me publicly, and when they failed, fate placed me in the right place to stop the Chaos that threatened the Empire.\"\n\"The priest who kept the faith alive in that corrupt city has sent his report,\" declared the Grand Theogonist then. \"In it he details how this nobleman, a paragon of Sigmarite ideals, fought alongside his men against daemons, even defeating a Chaos champion in personal combat.\"\nThe Emperor fixed his eyes on me. \"Bah… Graf Albrecht once again omitting information,\" the Emperor said, touching his forehead.\n\"No… I will see to it that my messenger is punished, Your Imperial Majesty. I made it clear that I personally fought that daemon who wielded a blade imbued with the Ruinous Powers. It was the hardest battle of my life; I stood on the brink of death. Had it not been for this armor, forged by our dawi friends, he would have run me through with ease. But when his blade bounced off the gromril, I seized the opening and struck off his head. Only then did the daemonic invasion begin to fade,\" I replied steadily.\n\"And what of the mountains of pyres raised by the Sigmarites?\" asked the Elector Count of Middenland.\n\"A city as corrupted as Marienburg had to be purified. Corruption infested every corner, Prince of Carroburg. Vampiric corruption in the Suiddock… Did you know that the vampire who hid there had ruled the city's underworld for centuries? Among his belongings we found documents linking him to none other than Vlad von Carstein. He was one of his generals, concealed in Marienburg as lord of its criminality. Furthermore, Chaos cults were on the verge of opening a portal. Had it not been for the intervention of the witch hunters, who knows what might have happened? Perhaps the terrible visions Sigmar sent me would have come to life,\" I replied calmly, noting that many sought to challenge me, but none dared contradict the Sigmarite clergy who backed me with such severity.\n\"Graf Albrech is a man of honor and duty. Clearly, he acted to safeguard the Empire. But let us not forget that those lands still have a living claimant,\" declared the Ar-Ulric, causing the counts of Middenheim and Middenland to fix their eyes on him.\n\"And let us not forget the obvious,\" resumed the Grand Theogonist. \"Before us stands a noble who has defeated champions of Chaos without falling under their mark. It is a clear sign that our lord Sigmar has blessed him to protect the Empire.\"\nThe Emperor remained silent, his expression dark. I could see that if he attempted to downplay my deeds or deny me reward, he would not only have to confront the Cult of Sigmar but also several powerful electors whose wrath could jeopardize the stability of his own line.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n\"Very well… with that said, we shall take a pause to deliberate the next point of the session. Graf Albrech, come with me to my study now,\" ordered the Emperor, rising abruptly and striding out of the Volkshalle.\nThe electors and the Grand Baron of Nordland stood immediately, whispering among themselves, while the Sigmarite trio remained calm and united, conversing with the Ar-Ulric. I followed the Emperor, who walked at a brisk pace until we reached his nearby study.\nWe entered, and the door closed behind us.\n\"Very well… what sort of plan do you have? How did you manage to gain the Grand Theogonist's support so thoroughly?\" asked the Emperor, visibly irritated. \"Have you been pretending to be naïve all this time? No… you're more cunning than you appear, aren't you? Answer me, Albrech… what is it that you truly want?\" he demanded, his voice thick with frustration as his composure began to slip.\n\"What do you mean, my Emperor?\" I replied calmly.\n\"All signs point to you aiming for the highest seat in the Empire. It was only a matter of time before the Grand Theogonist proposed it… that we grant you the title of Elector Count of the Westerlands. That would put me at a disadvantage: I would have to cede to you large parts of Reikland, and if you shield yourself under the Cult of Sigmar, I could not reclaim those lands without provoking their fury,\" said the Emperor, pouring himself wine, though the cup trembled in his hands.\n\"And what would be so wrong with that? All nobles dream of deciding who the next Emperor will be, do they not?\" I answered, seating myself across from him.\n\"If I support you, I lose Reinsfeld and Merxheim, which I had planned to turn into economic hubs to finance Reikland with taxes. And I gain enemies: Middenheim, Middenland, the Ar-Ulric… and probably Talabecland and Talabheim with their Ulrican leanings. If I don't support you, I face the united vote of the Cult of Sigmar and likely all the southern electors as well. That would ruin any chance of my son inheriting the throne,\" he confessed after taking a long drink.\n\"You see only two paths, my Emperor. I see a third. Recognize me as Elector Count, and I will cede part of the Westerlands to the Grand Baron of Nordland, along with a considerable sum of gold, in exchange for his public renunciation of any claim over my lands,\" I said calmly, noting how his breathing steadied.\n\"But even then, that makes you independent of Reikland,\" the Emperor replied, wary.\n\"I know when to stop biting. The crown has never interested me; I do not wish to be called Emperor. I only desire the title of Elector so that they stop seeing me as their lapdog. I offer you something unique: the chance to have a vassal Elector Count. I will still answer to Reikland. It would be the first true step toward unifying the Empire and ending the provinces' autonomy. My ultimate goal is to strengthen the Empire, and in that, our paths are more aligned than you think,\" I said with a calculated smile.\n\"That… that would be unheard of. None of the other electors would accept it. I'd set them all against me,\" the Emperor answered, torn between disbelief and curiosity.\n\"The Cult of Sigmar will continue to back you. With my vote and theirs, you would already have the base of five ballots for your son—far more than most can gather. Besides, Middenland, Middenheim, and the Ar-Ulric will always need my aid to cleanse their forests, so more than one might be persuaded. And if we triumph in the war against Bretonnia and rebuild the March of the Grey Mountains, another elector might join our cause,\" I added, rising and pacing slowly before him.\nThe Emperor began to consider it seriously… until at last a smile spread across his face.\"It might work… yes… it might work. To tie my dynasty to Ghal Maraz…\" he murmured with satisfaction.\n\"Exactly. You only need to place me at the head of the Imperial army… and I will win your battles. Against Bretonnia, against anyone. Moreover, I will consolidate the Empire's political borders as never before in its history,\" I answered with certainty.\nThe Emperor smiled even wider, nodding silently, at last realizing he had found a viable path.\nAfter that conversation, we returned immediately to the chamber to debate the question of the lands. For all his shouting and protests, the Grand Baron of Nordland was forced into a great compromise: I would cede all the lands north of the town of Vasse and Fort Solace, in a straight line, and also pay two million gold crowns. In exchange, the count would strike from his titles any claim over my domains. He was forced to agree, for he stood against nearly all the electors and was dangerously isolating himself.\nAs for me… I received the title of Prince of Marienburg and Elector Count of the Westerlands, gaining an electoral vote. Though, to soothe tensions, it was left unspoken that I still formally answered to Reikland, so that the arrangement would not provoke an immediate or open conflict…\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I had complete control of the situation—at least for the moment. Yes, paying so much gold was painful, but after the conquest of Marienburg I possessed enough wealth to afford such a monetary luxury.\nAt the end of the day, I had obtained what I desired most: the rank of general. Next year I would march to Bretonnia to secure the Empire's borders, and perhaps strike north into Kislev to halt their damned incursions. If that proved successful, I could even carry the war into Norsca and put an end to their raids, protecting the Empire before the time came to face campaigns further south—and, above all, to prevent that abomination Nagash from rising again.\nFor this, I had to be prepared. I had time, and still some gold left after paying the Grand Baron of Nordland. Since I hadn't needed to bribe the Emperor, I could allocate those funds to more useful projects: draining the swamps of my lands to make them fertile, multiplying agricultural output, and continuing to perfect, in my greenhouses, the selection of seeds stronger and more productive than anything we had ever seen.\nI returned to my laboratory to organize payments and request a great favor from my dawi friends. This year had to be used to the fullest. The train ride was as swift as usual; I barely paid attention to my cities, confident they were under control thanks to the administration of my dwarven advisors.\nUpon arrival, I decided to visit Durán. I hadn't tended to my griffon in days, and the creature, restless, was hunting rabbits and proudly showing them to me, as if demanding praise. We entered the mountains toward Durán's main karak, where he was busy overseeing the opening of new gromril veins for other clans that had recently arrived.\nThe horseback journey through the tunnels allowed me to see the change. The fortress was unrecognizable: statues everywhere, walls carved with runes, and corridors filled with life. Dawi artisans and merchants crowded the halls, and it was clear that reconstruction had transformed the place into a thriving center.\nIn the heart of the karak I found him, seated on his bronze throne, writing in thick tomes while surrounded by his kin. He looked up and smiled when he saw me.\n\"Durán, my friend, I bring news,\" I announced.\n\"Dawongi, what joy to see you in my stronghold. Tell me, how can I help you?\" he replied in his deep voice.\n\"Have you heard what happened in Marienburg, or should I explain it briefly?\" I asked.\n\"One of my engineers mentioned that you fought the umgi of that city, but I never quite understood why,\" he said, shaking his head.\n\"You should have seen it. They tried to steal dawi engineering… for who knows what purpose. Perhaps to replicate your marvels,\" I said, widening my eyes with indignation.\nMy words lit a fire. Every dwarf present looked at me as if I had spoken the gravest of taboos. Hatred blazed in their eyes.\n\"Those umgi did what!?\" several roared at once.\n\"Yes… those wretched merchants tried to seize what is ours. But worry not, I have already delivered justice. All the members of the Directorate are dead, and their dynasties are being hunted in every corner. It will not be long before the last of them perishes and the debt is fully repaid,\" I replied, raising my voice to share their fury.\nDurán clenched his teeth so hard he began muttering in Khazalid. Suddenly, he disappeared and returned with the Dammaz Kron.\n\"Names,\" he ordered, dipping the quill in red ink.\nOne by one, I began to list all the great houses of Marienburg that had formed part of the Directorate. Durán wrote their names in solemn runes, striking them out as soon as he confirmed their members were dead. His kin pressed close around him, tense, fists clenched and teeth gritted.\n\"Cursed umgi… no offense, dawongi,\" said one of Durán's relatives.\n\"No offense taken. I felt a similar rage when I received the letter in which they sought to seize our enterprise. The insult is nearly avenged, though some still remain outside the city. I will not rest until the last of them is dead,\" I answered coldly.\n\"Nor will we,\" said Durán, slamming the tome shut with thunderous force after writing the final entry in the Dammaz Kron.\n\"That said… I've come to deliver your share of what was recovered from the Marienburg venture. As I promised, thirty percent of everything. Though, to be honest, I'll leave it at the entrance of the tunnels—moving that much gold is too troublesome, and I've no idea how to transport it inside,\" I added, now speaking in a calmer, friendlier tone.\n\"And how much would that be?\" asked one of Durán's kin, opening a large ledger to begin recording.\n\"Something around a million and a half crowns. To be honest, I don't yet have the exact number since the counting is still ongoing. It might be a little more, or a little less… but once it's confirmed, we'll settle accounts. If you don't mind, of course,\" I replied with a faint smile.\n\"A vast sum of gold… worth the wait,\" said the dwarf as he noted the entry in his records.\n\"And now that I hold political power, I'll begin selling black powder. That means steady payments for your clan,\" I added, looking at Durán and his kin.\n\"We are honored to do business with you, dawongi,\" Durán replied, inclining his head slightly.\n\"Well, speaking of business… I have a major one at hand, and you're the only ones I trust. Not long ago, I nearly died before a demon; if not for this gromril armor, I'd already be in Morr's gardens. But many of my men weren't so fortunate: they lack such protection. That is why I need to know if it's possible for you to forge five hundred full suits of armor, inscribed with minor runes, for my personal forces. And if so, tell me the price—I'll pay it all,\" I stated firmly.\n\"Five hundred runic armors…?\" Durán repeated, glancing at his runesmith, who looked pensive.\n\"It is possible,\" the dwarf said after a pause. \"There are enough runesmiths in this karak. But we would need to have the men here to take their measurements.\"\n\"That won't be necessary. Make them to the dimensions of an average umgi. Don't use my own frame—I'm taller than most. I'd rather have them prepared and stored, ready to be handed out to those who deserve them,\" I replied.\n\"It will be difficult to convince the runesmiths not to work each piece to exact fit… but if it is for you, dawongi, there will be no objection. The price, however, will be steep: gold for every service of the runesmiths,\" said the clan artisan, bowing his head respectfully.\n\"Excellent… you can't imagine the relief it brings me to know my men will have the finest armor to protect themselves. But the swords… damn, I'll need runic swords for them as well,\" I said, suddenly remembering the need.\n\"That will not be a problem, dawongi. Every sword will be flawless, I'll see to it personally. Only one condition…\" said the dwarven smith, fixing his eyes on me.\n\"The clause of return upon the bearer's death, correct?\" I asked at once.\n\"Exactly. You know it well. It is only a matter of control. If the bearer dies violently, the pieces must be recovered for repair. We cannot allow our craft to be lost or destroyed. It would be poorly regarded by the other clans,\" he explained with solemnity.\n\"Of course… of course, I understand. Entirely reasonable,\" I replied, satisfied.\nThe runesmith began speaking with Durán's treasurer. Both examined ledgers and accounts for several minutes, exchanging numbers in hushed tones.\n\"Dawongi, the payment is already settled with the gold for the gunpowder. As soon as your order is complete, we will send everything directly to your men,\" the treasurer finally confirmed.\n\"Perfect. I trust in your wisdom to choose the best combination of runes. I've heard of banner runes capable of dispersing the taint of Chaos… is that true?\" I asked with keen interest.\n\"Indeed, dawongi. Do you wish us to prepare such runic banners for your house?\" the smith responded.\n\"Yes, exactly. I've noticed I draw far too much attention from the daemons, and not all my men have the willpower to resist their temptations. Better they be safer,\" I explained with gravity.\n\"In that case, it shall be done. You have my guarantee,\" affirmed the runesmith.\n\"Well then, I won't keep you from your work, my friends. I wish you fortune in your labors. Should any problem arise, inform me at once. I must return and face the chaos that awaits me in Marienburg,\" I said, taking my leave and mounting my horse once again.\nThere my young griffon awaited me, calmly devouring his second rabbit of the day. It seemed he was hungrier than ever—a clear sign he was growing rapidly.\nThus, tending to my griffon, I returned to Reinsfeld to see what had happened in my lands during my absence. Fortunately, nothing serious had occurred. Beyond a few cultists uncovered, some disgruntled guilds, and the fact that merchants had mysteriously stopped arriving from Marienburg, everything remained in order.\nThe most notable development was that my bank had already begun to operate, managed by the dawi. They oversaw granting loans to non-guild artisans at low interest, and investing in enterprises proven to be profitable, ensuring constant returns. None better suited to that task than a dwarf.\nI inspected my fields, where once again an overflowing harvest of legumes had triggered a massive drop in food prices within the city. That drew numerous merchants, who came only to load their carts with provisions and return to their lands, applying the classic tactic of buying cheap and selling dear.\nWhat pleased me even more was that some merchants had begun hiring my trains to transport grain to Altdorf. One wealthy man even rented the entire train, filling it to the brim with grain and flour, unloading it in the capital for enormous profits thanks to my abundant harvests.\nMeanwhile, plans were already underway to extend the railway toward Nuln, with the purpose of linking the Empire's main commercial centers and multiplying transport revenues. Until Marienburg was fully restored, that would be the route giving my railroads their greatest use.\nStopping in Merxheim, I reviewed the condition of the Bretonnian peasants I had recently freed from serfdom, making them free men. I wanted to see how many of them would seize the chance to flee back to Bretonnia—and to my surprise, none wished to return. Every family stayed, adopting Reikspiel as a secondary tongue and relying constantly on the cathedral-hospital of Shallya, whose work had increased notably with the population growth.\nEven the Bretonnian men-at-arms I had freed on trial, after long captivity in my lands, had remained. Many took work as local guards in the Bretonnian villages, supporting my imperial garrisons—something especially useful now that we were overextended with so many regions to defend.\nThe results left me satisfied. These new subjects had already grown used to living as free men, earning wages for their labor, without losing the slightest diligence. On the contrary, they seemed almost addicted to toil and hard work, as though freedom had spurred them on further.\nOn my way back to Marienburg, I took two work crews of dawi with me: one to continue draining swamps in my lands, and the other to travel with me to the city to begin its reconstruction. For the moment, Marienburg was little more than an empty skeleton, devastated after political and religious purges. It had been left in terrible condition, though for the first time in centuries it could be considered nearly free of corruption. Hundreds of witch hunters still patrolled its streets with zeal, determined to root out even the faintest cultist hiding among the ruins.\nAlthough… perhaps I could make an offer to the Emperor, to buy all his Bretonnian peasants and use them to repopulate the Westerlands…\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The once great and powerful city had fallen to the lowest point in all its recent history. Its population had collapsed between the daemonic massacre, the vampiric incursion, and the political and religious purges. The city no longer had a soul.\nWhich, in a certain sense, was good: it meant we had ripped out much of that rebellious spirit that had always characterized its people. The problem was the sheer collapse of the population. From nearly two hundred thousand inhabitants, the last census I ordered—so it could be integrated into the imperial census of 2490—showed barely sixty thousand still residing in the city. A catastrophic drop. Most of the foreign groups had fled as soon as they encountered the most fanatical witch hunters imaginable, who scoured every last corner.\nThe foreign quarters in the city disappeared almost entirely. Tileans, Estalians, Easterners… all fled back to their homelands or burned in the purifying fire of Sigmar's templars, eager to punish Marienburg as harshly as possible for its secession—and to confiscate everything that had once belonged to the Cult.\nWhen finally the pyres burned out, the city had suffered so much that in many districts there was no one left walking the streets. Only in the common quarters was there some trace of life. Suiddock, on the other hand, was nothing but ruins: mountains of rubble still uncleared. Rebuilding Marienburg would be the hardest work of all. I had conquered the city, I had obtained my title… but now I needed peace.\nSo much peace that I decided to postpone my traditional yearly cleansing of the Drakwald, despite the fact that the Elector Count of Middenheim and the Ar-Ulric had invited me again. I recommended they secure their own areas, for I had too much to do.\nOne of my first measures was to declare all the inhabitants of the Wastelands—small, isolated villages beyond Marienburg's walls—as serfs, stripping them of their previous rights and forcing them to move into the city. I had no intention of spending resources protecting insignificant hamlets. With the help of my men at the border, we brought about fifteen thousand inhabitants in a matter of days.\nImmediately, I forced them to work clearing rubble under the supervision of the dawi I had brought for the reconstruction. I also hired local dwarves as laborers for the next phases, for Marienburg had to become once more a commercial hub that would draw merchants, and that meant beginning with the harbor.\nFor days we dedicated ourselves to clearing mountains of ruins while the dawi prepared the foundations of a great merchant port, with capacity to load and unload ships even larger than those that once sailed these waters. Many empty buildings were demolished; their owners were ashes, nothing remained. All of it with one purpose: to prepare the southern port to be, in time, a first-rate commercial center.\n\"Finally you deign to appear, butcher,\" said a voice behind me.\nI turned to find a group of priests from the Cult of Manann. Their faces made no attempt to hide their displeasure.\n\"And with great honor,\" I replied with a cold smile. \"The city needed an urgent purge. If you think it would have been better to leave Chaos roaming free… perhaps I should call back the witch hunters. Maybe this time they'll do a better job.\"\n\"Those fanatical dogs of Sigmar burned several of ours, only for defending our god's temples. With the help of your men, Graf…!\" the woman at the front of the group spat back.\n\"Elector Count,\" I corrected her at once, turning again toward the harbor to watch the progress of the cranes that would move supplies from ships to trains. \"Elector Count Albrech von Reinsfeld, Prince of Marienburg.\"\n\"The Cult of Manann demands immediate compensation for what we have suffered,\" the woman insisted, but I paid her not the slightest attention.\n\"Noble dawi, do you think it would be possible for some of the great dwarven ships to dock here?\" I asked the engineer who was measuring the harbor.\n\"Do not ignore me, Elector Count! This is a serious matter. The Cult of Manann is recognized by the Empire, and your actions will be punished severely,\" the woman shouted, growing more furious.\n\"Ah yes… of course. I'll be punished. Punished so harshly that they gave me the title of Elector Count as an 'example.' Oh, poor me!—I said in feigned dramatics—For seizing the temples of a band of secessionists, the Empire punished me with political power. What a cruel fate… —I added with sarcasm—It's sarcasm, in case you missed it.\"\n\"We will take this grievance to the Emperor… we are a cult protected by the Empire, and what you have done is nothing more than baseless punishment,\" the woman said firmly, though she trembled with rage.\n\"The truth, woman, is that no one cares what you do… no one. Do you see that bonfire there? Throw your letter of complaint into it, and it will have exactly the same effect as carrying it to Altdorf. Nothing will change. The Cult of Sigmar is the only one that matters now, and they are delighted with what is happening here. So withdraw, before your presence finally bores me,\" I replied, turning back again to watch the work on the harbor.\nI only heard the angry murmurs of the priests of Manann as they retreated to what was left of their hideouts. Their properties had been almost entirely confiscated by the sigmarites, who then sold them to me if they had no immediate use for them. The Cult of Sigmar cared little about being pointed at: eliminating at the root the influence of a cult born from Marienburg's treachery was an absolute triumph.\nThe days carried on and the city slowly began to recover a heartbeat of life. Meanwhile, the cults that had lost everything desperately tried to rebuild their political power. The Cult of Manann, humiliated, attempted to gather the few merchants that remained to fund a new temple, but since they no longer owned any land within the city walls, they were forced to build outside them. It was a symbolic and bitter victory: the sigmarites had banished their rivals to live beyond the safety of the walls, as a permanent mockery.\nMy plans went far beyond that humiliation. I had already begun negotiations with the Emperor to purchase all the Bretonnian serfs of Parravon and Montfort, intending to bring them into these lands. I had sent detailed reports about the rapid spread of the Sigmarite cult among the Bretonnians of Merxheim, many of whom already spoke Reikspiel fluently. That made them ideal candidates to populate Marienburg and my domains, for across all my possessions I barely reached a quarter of a million inhabitants, leaving my territories dangerously underpopulated.\nI did not wish to receive another colonization right, for that would mean surrendering lands that I would later have to buy back . I preferred the safer route: to purchase directly the Bretonnians of Parravon, tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, who would soon arrive in my lands to work under my authority. All that remained was for the Emperor to set the price of each Bretonnian serf before the transfer began.\nThe other option was to march into Bretonnia and begin their abduction, taking advantage of the fact that I had their cities within striking distance. But I lacked many soldiers, as all my forces were overextended trying to protect every fortress and key location, so my attack would be weak at best—especially considering the Bretonnians must already be expecting some strike, knowing by now who governed these lands.\nGoverning Marienburg was honestly a headache… the dawi presented me with a formal complaint due to the lack of sales of their products. With commerce diminished, there was no one left to buy their crafts. Of course, it was a very polite complaint by dwarven standards, simply requesting measures to attract new merchants soon, lest problems arise. Notably, the word grievance was carefully avoided.\nThe sea elves wasted no time trying to take advantage of the situation. They demanded tax cuts, reduced tolls… even exemptions from all dues owed for operating in the city. In exchange, they promised a considerable increase in trade with Ulthuan, claiming that by working together we could revive the city. Naturally, that might have worked on any ordinary fool—but not on me. I would never grant them more political power than they already enjoyed thanks to Marienburg's former dealings.\nWhile I reviewed the plans the dawi had presented to remodel Marienburg—plans for a new harbor outside the city, large enough to draw in massive ships—I heard the crunching of a chicken's bones, torn apart by my gryphon, finishing its meal with delight.\nSuddenly, one of my men entered the palace.\n\"My lord, a delegation from Kislev has arrived by ship and requests an audience,\" said my guard.\n\"They have free passage to Altdorf… I will not deny them transit. Wish them a good journey and give them some of the jewels confiscated from the merchants,\" I replied, still focused on the plans.\n\"They insist on speaking with the lord of the city, my lord. They say their business is directly with you,\" the guard pressed.\n\"Ugh… I am a terrible diplomat… let them in,\" I said with annoyance.\nI already knew they likely came to complain about what had happened to their countrymen, nearly forced to flee back to their frozen homeland. I moved to one of the many chambers of the palace, once used to receive foreign ambassadors. Now they all lay empty, for the delegations that once resided in Marienburg had fled or vanished. This would be the first foreign audience since the city's fall, and for that reason I had to at least feign courtesy.\nThey did not take long to arrive. The Kislevites entered with firm strides. As expected, they wore heavy garments and thick animal furs, though of impeccable quality, adorned with embroidery and gems. It was clear they were no simple northern barbarians. I observed them in silence until I felt it: the presence of magic. There was a mage among them. At once I grew alert, scanning their faces for the bearer of that arcane power.\nFinally, I met the gaze of a young Kislevite noble who stared back with eyes as cold as ice.\n\"Greetings, envoys from the lands of Ursun. To what do I owe this pleasant visit within my domains?\" I said with a smile, keeping my eyes fixed on the mage… ready to react to any situation.\n\"We understood that the city had recently fallen once more under the Imperial yoke… and it seems the information the merchants provided us was true. Sigmar reigns again in Marienburg… but the great Tsar Vladimir Bokha demands an explanation for the attacks upon our countrymen,\" said the ambassador firmly.\n\"The city was infested with corruption, ambassador… a daemonic portal was opened, and a vampire lurked in the docks, along with countless cults. The Cult of Sigmar decided the city must be purged, and many of your people fell within that category. If you wish to investigate further, go to Altdorf and request an audience with the Grand Theogonist,\" I replied, never taking my eyes from the mage.\n\"So you claim you had nothing to do with the murder of our people,\" the ambassador said, raising an eyebrow.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"No… not by my orders at least. Beyond the support I lent to the witch hunters' actions, I have no interest in killing innocent folk,\" I answered calmly.\nThe ambassador nodded, turning his gaze to the mage, who stepped forward.\n\"Katherine Bokha, imperial noble… daughter of Prince Boris Bokha. In the name of my grandfather, the great Tsar Vladimir Bokha, we require that the trade routes between Marienburg and Kislev be restored as swiftly as possible. We must sell whale oil, narwhal ivory, smoked fish, and furs, and in turn we need the salt once provided by Marienburg delivered again without delay,\" said the young Kislevite solemnly, though her eyes never ceased watching my every movement.\n\"That should not be any problem at all…\" I replied.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It seemed they had no wish for an open conflict with the Empire, especially at a time when it was in a phase of expansion—where the slightest pressure, such as trouble with their merchants, could redirect the rising Imperial army.\nThe ambassadors did not stay long. After hearing my words, they went on to Altdorf, where they would demand explanations from those they considered responsible for the great pyres that had consumed so many of their people in Marienburg.\nMeanwhile, we continued to expand the city. Much of the nearby swampland had recently been drained, leaving the ground ready for building or farming. However, given how late in the season it was for planting, the wisest course was to use those new lands for construction. Many urban districts of Marienburg were demolished—not only to clear away ruins, but to make room for warehouses, workshops, and storehouses. I did not care so much about housing people there, but about turning the city into a massive center of business.\nAfter the Kislevite visit, more embassies came one after another, sent from various cities to confirm what had happened. I gave them all the same answer: any complaint or problem must be taken to Altdorf. My role was simpler and far more profitable: to announce that doing business in Marienburg was once again safe, and that we were working tirelessly to rebuild wide ports, solid warehouses, and properties ready to be rented by merchants and traders. Security was guaranteed, and the rest was pure opportunity.\nThe first to return were the Tileans. Barely days after signing the agreement with their ambassador, their merchants began arriving in masses. And with them came gold into my hands—renting properties, leasing warehouses, and using my trains to transport goods into the heart of the Empire. The loading and unloading service quickly became one of the city's most demanding tasks, and each day new traders arrived, eager to claim a place in the rising Marienburg.\nNext came the Kislevites again, setting up their own warehouses and workshops to sell vast amounts of furs, grease, and meat from northern beasts—and above all, the riches of the whaling trade. They brought oil, narwhal ivory, and carved bones, products in high demand throughout the Empire. But what they sought most was not to sell, but to buy: they wanted salt. A great deal of salt.\nUntil then, their suppliers were merchants buying rock salt from dawi in southern settlements, paying high prices for a resource that, in theory, was right before everyone's eyes: seawater. All one had to do was evaporate it. The problem was that Marienburg's climate was far too cold most of the year, limiting that method to only a few months. But then I had an idea.\nWhat if I combined the technique with dwarven runes? The runes could generate constant heat, far more reliable than depending on the sun in these gray lands—and with rune-heat, the process could be accelerated to produce mountains of refined salt. An almost endless system of distillation and evaporation. With it, I would not only supply Kislev, but the entire Empire. And best of all, I would turn something as simple as seawater into an inexhaustible fortune.\nI contacted Hieronymus's old friend in the city, a runesmith who still lived in Marienburg, and made him my great commission. I needed enormous distillers reinforced with two key runes: the rune of heat, and the rune of stability. If both could be joined in one mechanism, seawater would evaporate on its own, leaving behind only salt, while the condensed vapor could be stored and used as drinking water. Granted, in the Westerlands fresh water was not scarce thanks to swamps and rivers—but nothing should go to waste: every drop had to serve a purpose.\nThe dawi wasted no time getting to work. The city was only just recovering and trade had barely returned to its streets, so he had few other orders. He assured me that everything would be ready soon, and that his hammers would not rest until the first distillers were working.\nDays passed, and with them Marienburg began to grow again at a steady pace. Each day more ships arrived, and soon even merchants from Araby returned, bringing with them hundreds of traders and thousands of sailors who gradually settled in the city, eager to open businesses and establish themselves. Many rented my properties at high rates, filling my coffers with gold with little effort on my part beyond leasing warehouses, storehouses, and homes. The new constructions, overseen by dwarven engineers, multiplied on the outskirts, forming entire districts to house the working population supporting this rebirth.\nGold flowed. And although the expenses were enormous—paying my army, maintaining the administration, covering compensations for the fallen, and giving generous donations to the cults—for the first time my income exceeded my outflow. I no longer relied solely on rare alchemical productions or costly experiments. Soon I would not just be rich, but immensely rich. And with that gold I would forge my legacy: to turn Marienburg into the greatest fortress ever seen, reinforced with the finest dwarven runes, until anyone who laid eyes on it would think ten times before daring even to imagine a siege.\nAnd I had already decided once and for all where to take the next step: Nuln.\nAt first, I had no intention of attending the great weapons competition in the city of Nuln. Now, however, it was nearly impossible for anyone to force me to hand over a superior design against my will—but I could clearly take advantage of the occasion to display my entire arsenal before the Empire. And, if I played my cards right, I could even mass-produce it—always, of course, under the strict supervision of the dawi. The future weapons factory I would build in Marienburg must have the best runic security system, demon-proof, to avoid surprises like the secret production of cursed or corrupted weaponry.\nOnce the dawi completed my commission for runic armaments, I would set them to work on building that factory. There, my workers and smiths would dedicate themselves exclusively to the production of muskets and other weapons that, sooner or later, would become the standard of the Imperial army.\nThus, I boarded my train bound for Altdorf, loaded with carefully selected weaponry for the exhibition. From there, I continued on to Nuln. The railway line to that city was neither officialized nor begun yet, so there was no choice but to finish the journey on horseback. Unfortunately, until my plans were complete, I could not enjoy the luxury of traveling from Marienburg to Nuln in a single day by rail.\nFor now, all I could do was hope the journey would be quiet and that no unforeseen event would divert me from my goals.\nNuln was a great city, as one would expect from the industrial heart of the Empire. Like Altdorf, it had a cosmopolitan culture where countless peoples and customs mingled. What struck me most was the sheer number of ogres walking its streets—and even more so, their companions: the gnoblars. These strange beings seemed to be servants, pets, and even food for the ogres. On more than one occasion, I watched in mild astonishment as one of those giants grabbed a gnoblar off its shoulders, lifted it as if it weighed nothing, and without hesitation tossed it straight into its mouth, devouring it with an unpleasantly audible crunch.\nMy arrival in Nuln was well received, as befitted my rank and my new title. Fortunately for me, the city did not seem as saturated with priests and templars as Altdorf; here I could walk more freely, without constantly feeling the breath of witch hunters at my back. Perhaps in this city they were more restrained, or perhaps I had simply grown too accustomed to the brutality of the Sigmarite fanatics who, in Marienburg, had purified everything with merciless fire.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nIn any case, I was soon invited to one of the preliminary banquets of the weapons competition. There gathered high nobles, merchants, and ambassadors from all across the Old World, each eager to secure a seat at the table of the future. After all, whoever obtained permission to purchase the standardized weaponry of the Empire would hold the key to strengthening their borders and ensuring the safety of their lands. It did not surprise me in the least to find representatives from Estalia, Tilea, Miragliano, and even Kislev, all waiting to witness the field tests firsthand.\nConsidering my position and ambitions, I decided to attend the banquet. Though I disliked the atmosphere filled with flatterers and favor-seekers, ever willing to grovel for recognition or a purse of gold, this was far too good an opportunity to waste. Several powerful figures, including some Elector Counts, would be present; negotiating with them in the future could prove more valuable than any cannon or musket displayed on the testing grounds.\nUnlike Altdorf, where banquets were often divided into multiple halls to keep rival factions of Imperial politics apart, in Nuln there was only one great hall. And though the chamber was majestic—laden with tapestries, chandeliers, and silverware shining under the lights—it lacked the careful separation of the capital. Here, all guests were mixed in one space, allowing one to see at once who hated whom, and how rivalries showed in every glance and every uncomfortable gesture among the diners.\nI ordered my men not to let anyone bother me, unless the person had a title high enough to justify the interruption. Thanks to this, most of the banquet passed in silence for me, calmly observing as others lost themselves in wine and music.\nSuddenly, the clamor shattered the calm: one of the enormous silver mirrors in the great hall came crashing down, shattering into pieces on the floor. An uneasy silence gripped the hall for a few seconds—until, as if repeating a bad omen, another mirror fell and splintered into a thousand fragments. I heard that one of the ladies had tripped against the frames, causing the disaster. Yet the Elector Count of Wissenland seemed not to care in the slightest; he simply continued drinking and celebrating as if nothing had happened.\nWine flowed among all the guests, but I kept sober. I would never allow alcohol to cloud my judgment in a place full of rivals, flatterers, and possible enemies. I preferred to remain still, watching from my seat as the hall's attention focused on a woman.\nIt was strangely curious: though she was attractive, she was not the only beauty in the room, nor did she seem to wield real power, save her obvious wealth. And yet, everyone seemed eager to speak with her, as if her mere presence carried an irresistible magnetism.\n\"She could be… one of those vampires,\" I thought silently, following her with cautious eyes. As if hearing my thoughts, the woman slowly turned toward me, offering a soft, faint smile before turning her attention back to the crowd of admirers around her.\nLater, I had a brief conversation with the Elector Count of Wissenland. He insisted I accept his invitation to one of his private chambers, a proposal I disliked greatly but felt compelled to accept so as not to create unnecessary tension. Every time I found myself before his son, Leos, an odd, almost unnatural sensation crawled over me, raising the hairs on my skin. There was something in that young man that reminded me of the degenerate cultists of Slaanesh… and every time I saw him, I felt the urge to erase him from existence.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I even consider it superior to the right of being designated to choose the weaponry that will defend the Empire's borders. From the envoys of Tilea and Estalia, eager to place large orders of arms, to the Kislevites, who seek to exchange goods for vast amounts of weapons to equip their vanguards against the Norscan incursions—all have gathered here.\nBut no less important is the presence of my esteemed colleagues, the Elector Counts, who have granted me the privilege of gathering such illustrious nobles in my city. Thus, all have been able to behold the magnificence of the University of Nuln and appreciate what has been achieved after so many years of effort, despite the misfortunes that once befell this city since the days of the great Magnus the Pious.\nWhat has thrilled me the most, however, has been the presence of the new Elector Count of the Westerlands. The young man is a true strategic genius in the application of technology on the battlefield. Much of his army has shifted from swords and halberds to a much broader use of firearms. It is admirable how he knows how to combine ancient tactics with modern innovations to defeat the Bretonnians or apply effective defenses against the beastmen hordes. One of my greatest satisfactions was analyzing his report on a fortress erected in Middenland.\nAlbrechsheim, as the local nobles named it in honor of its founder, is already considered one of the strongest fortresses of the Empire after Middenheim, though built in wood. Today it stands as a formidable bastion in the forests of the Drakwald, where many inhabitants of Middenland have taken refuge, as it is one of the safest places in the region. The engineering applied is exquisite; I would not be surprised if dwarfen knowledge had been involved in its design. The Elector Count maintains a close friendship with the dawi, which places him in an enviable position regarding knowledge and secrets. Proof of this is his gromril plate armor, which shone at the last banquet as testimony of that relationship.\nThe only drawback with Elector Count Albrech is that he is an extremely reserved man. He does not like to share the tales of his campaigns, and lately I have tried—without success—to inquire about the war for Marienburg, the battles fought there, and the performance of his weapons in those circumstances. There are even rumors of a cannon capable of firing multiple types of ammunition, though for now it is all scarce and fragmented hearsay, dependent on word of mouth, since much information is being controlled by the Cult of Sigmar after Albrech uncovered details of a cult in Altdorf that sought to attack the city and which is now being hunted down relentlessly.\nWhat I still cannot understand is Elector Count Albrech himself. I have made every effort to offer him all the possible luxuries in the quarters I assigned to him, and yet I heard him tell his men that he would already be buying a mansion in the city, were it not that none are available. I confess I am puzzled, for I have done all within my power to ensure his satisfaction: an army of servants at his disposal, delicacies seasoned with the finest spices from Araby and Cathay, daily banquets where, though not always in his honor, I always ensured he was among us.\nAnd still, nothing seems enough. Wherever he goes, he carries himself with an air of perpetual tension, as if at any moment someone might try to end his life. He has never removed his gromril armor since setting foot in the city, except when he washes it, every day, with the same unchanging rigor.\nEven today, at a banquet I organized expressly in his honor, his demeanor did not improve—it worsened. He seemed so tense that one might have thought he would erupt into violence at any moment. And it would not be an exaggeration, for everyone knows that the feats of strength of Count Albrech are renowned throughout the Empire.\n\"Then, Elector Count Albrech, are you enjoying this occasion?\" I asked with a broad smile as I approached to greet one of the members of the most prestigious embassies in Nuln.\n\"Yes…\" he replied curtly, lying shamelessly only so as not to offend me. \"Konstantin, when will the competition finally take place? I appreciate all this, but I have come essentially for the firearms competition. Nothing more. I do not care much for these gatherings.\"\n\"Soon… very soon,\" I said as we walked. \"We are settling the bureaucracy for the registration of minor gunsmiths in this competition.\"\n\"No one has spoken to me about that paperwork,\" the Elector Count replied, fixing me with a stern gaze.\n\"No, no, of course not. That information is only to know who represents each weapon. Such a requirement would never be made of you, Count Albrech. The entire Empire knows your name and your glory for the recovery of Marienburg. It is unnecessary to request from you data that is already public knowledge,\" I answered quickly, trying to dispel his suspicion.\n\"Ah… I see,\" said Albrech, stopping in front of the Kislevite embassy's entourage.\n\"Friends of the Empire…\" I exclaimed, approaching the group of Kislevites who were eating and drinking at a table prepared with the utmost care. I had sought to replicate even the smallest detail of their traditional Kislevite cuisine. \"Princess Katarin of Kislev, I hope everything is to your liking. I have done the impossible to recreate the flavors of your land.\"\n\"In the name of my grandfather, the great Tzar of Kislev, I thank you for your concern,\" replied the princess in an icy tone.\nI then noticed how one of the amulets of the Cult of Sigmar, embedded in Albrech's armor, began to vibrate in the presence of the young woman. \"It must be the ice magic of Kislev that is activating my amulet…\" said the Count, watching the princess intently.\n\"If you are thinking of burning her, you will have to go through me first, noble,\" one of the Ice Guard immediately intervened, stepping forward with her hand on the hilt of her weapon.\nI tensed immediately. Knowing the Count, it could turn into a bloodbath. But I watched him calmly. He didn't lunge forward—which was a miracle in itself. He first looked at the princess, then at the guard, and back at the princess again, raising his hand as if waiting for her signal before drawing his blade.\n\"Enough. He did not mean to offend us,\" Katarin settled the matter with calm authority.\n\"As I said, it was an act of the Cult of Sigmar. I allowed it because the city was crawling with corrupt sects… But it would not be wise to break our newly signed trade agreement with Kislev over a simple misunderstanding,\" Albrech replied firmly.\n\"Setting that aside—\" I intervened with a diplomatic smile, \"I understand you intend to present weapons made in Kislev in this competition. May I ask about the weapon in question, and whether you have the capacity to produce on the scale required should you win?\"The most update n0vels are published on ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"The Motherland, though not yet capable of mass production, could achieve it with Imperial funds to develop our industry,\" answered the princess, signaling to one of her men. He brought forth a strange arquebus to which an axe had been attached.\n\"May I?\" Count Albrech asked, extending his hand.\n\"Do you know how to handle it?\" the Kislevite guard replied with distrust.\n\"Count Albrech is one of the finest men in the Empire with firearms. He has tested them in real combat,\" I assured, to ease the tension.\nThe guard looked to his princess. She nodded, and the weapon changed hands.\n\"Heavy…\" was Albrech's first remark, bluntly. \". I see it's matchlock… so, I deduce a lack of technical knowledge, yes?\"\nThe Kislevite did not reply. Albrech continued: \"The barrel is unrifled, which reduces accuracy. And I see irregularities in the iron—signs the temperature wasn't properly kept during forging. Still, the ergonomics are surprising, even with the axe. Overall… it's a decent weapon.\" He handed the arquebus back to the guard, who received it with clear displeasure.\n\"He speaks as if he were a master gunsmith,\" Princess Katarin said.\n\"I move among the dawi. I've seen quality,\" Albrech replied, pulling out a pistol and handing it to the Kislevites. \"For men, it is a good weapon. For dwarfs… it would be cheap trash.\"\n\"The barrel is too small,\" one of them objected immediately, sharply.\n\"It uses this type of ammunition,\" Albrech explained, showing a different projectile. \"Designed to improve accuracy and penetration, at the cost of the brute impact of a larger lead ball.\"\n\"Impressive… impressive. Will this be the level of weapons you present in the competition? An admirable level of innovation…\" I said, carefully taking the projectile to examine it. \"May I?\" I gestured toward his other pistol.\n\"Of course,\" the Count replied, handing me his second pistol.\nI loaded it step by step. The barrel was rifled, and the shot fit with ease. It was evident this had been crafted by hand, with extraordinary care. This competition would certainly reveal much of the dawi's marvels.\n\"Clearly, it is only a pistol and cannot compare much to a musket from my forges… but tell me, Princess Katarin, would you be interested in placing an order of weapons in your grandfather's name?\" Albrech said with a smile.\n\"Excuse me for a moment,\" I said to the Kislevites as they inspected the pistol, pulling Albrech slightly aside. \"It is not wise to sell weapons to the Kislevites when the Imperial armies are not yet fully equipped with the best armament—which will surely win. I have seen nothing close to what has been shown at the University of Nuln, so your muskets will certainly prevail,\" I told Count Albrech.\n\"I know…\" Albrech said calmly, though his smile was sharp. \"But I will need many clients in the future, and I think selling lower-quality weapons to the Kislevites might be prudent. It would give me income to expand my modest production into something more general. Besides, the best weapons will always be reserved for the Empire. When the competition arrives, I will unveil what my gunsmiths have created and what my alchemists have devised… something so astonishing you'll be left drooling at the sight.\"\n\"What is it?\" I asked with interest, leaning toward him.\nThere was no answer. Only that impenetrable smile.\n\"Come now, Elector Count Albrech, what is it? Some new type of percussion? A safer method of producing gunpowder? Or perhaps that multi-shot cannon rumored to have been used in Marienburg?\" I pressed.\nSilence. The smile remained.\nWe returned to the Kislevites, who handed the pistol back as the princess began negotiating with the Count about the price and quantities of arms she could purchase with the permits granted to her ambassador in the Empire. The talks progressed coldly, until Albrech finally spoke.\n\"Just one question before closing any future deal…\" he said harshly, fixing his eyes on the princess. \"Will these weapons be used to raid Imperial lands, as you do every year?\"\n\"Such actions are not carried out by the Tzar, Elector Count,\" the princess replied.\n\"Yes, but that was not my question. Will Kislevite raids on the Empire continue, as they do every year?\" he pressed again, making the Kislevites tense.\n\"I will inform my grandfather, the great Tzar, of your grievance… We will try to identify which boyars are responsible for such actions,\" the princess said.\n\"Good… then we can agree on a price,\" he concluded with a smile.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The thought that someone working so closely with the dawi might have developed weapons inspired by their mastery kept me restless. Do not misunderstand me: dwarven creations are masterpieces of craftsmanship, but they are not designed to be mass-produced. If the Count had managed to adapt that knowledge to human scale, what would be presented at the tournament could change the future of the Empire. That secrecy surrounding him only made my sleeplessness grow.\nI tried, in vain, to obtain early information. I wanted my men to observe the military camps of the Count of the Westerlands, but they were too heavily guarded to risk an attempt. I cursed myself for wasting energy extending banquets and receptions in honor of foreign embassies, instead of focusing on what truly mattered to me: witnessing firsthand the technological advances that could benefit the Empire.\nI had no choice but to wait. Thus, the days passed between preparations for the shooting trials and the selection of shooters. It was vital that those chosen were not hardened veterans in musket handling, for their experience would skew the result. We needed men who knew only the basics, to fairly measure the ease and effectiveness of each weapon presented.\nMeanwhile, the absence of the Prince of Marienburg was evident. He was withdrawn with his team, refining every last detail of his armament for the big day, ensuring that nothing was left to chance.\nAnd finally, the day arrived. Despite the lack of sleep, excitement kept me awake and alert as I arrived at the shooting field prepared for the event. Mannequins covered in armor had been placed at different distances to assess both short- and long-range accuracy and impact. Black powder and ammunition, fresh from the forges of Nuln, awaited ready.\nEverything seemed to be going perfectly as gunsmiths from all over the Empire began arriving to exhibit their creations. Among them, many engineers had come as observers, eager to witness the novelties. There were also numerous dawi; and while their weapons were, without question, vastly superior to almost everything produced in the Empire, they were impossible to consider at the required scale. Only they could replicate them, and the Empire needed quantity, not just quality. We could not wait weeks or months for each piece, no matter how secure and durable they were.\nMy duty, however, was different: to ensure that the weapons presented met the Emperor's requirements. They had to be as good as possible in quality, yes, but also easy to mass-produce, viable to manufacture in large numbers… and, of course, affordable. No weapon should exceed fifty crowns if we wanted to equip Imperial regiments with it.\nThe first trials of the local gunsmiths from Nuln and Hochland had already begun as I conversed with the different embassies about the results obtained so far.\n\"Don't you think the amount of powder you recommended is a bit excessive for your weapons?\" I asked the Princess of Kislev, watching as her muskets were put to the test.\n\"These are the specifications our gunsmiths recommended,\" replied one of her guards, while the princess merely observed the shots in silence.\n\"I see…\" I muttered, hoping none of those weapons would explode in the hands of the poor recruits chosen to test them.\nThen, the princess spoke in a harsh, heavy Reikspiel \"There is something I would like to know, if it is not too much trouble, lord of the city.\"\n\"Tell me. If it is within my knowledge, I will be glad to help,\" I replied, genuinely surprised by her request.\n\"The Prince of Marienburg… is he a trustworthy man? We are considering purchasing a shipment of weapons, but so far no one really knows who he is, nor if he is someone who will honor such an important responsibility.\"\n\"Albrecht,\" I said, adjusting myself before answering. \"He is a recently elevated noble, famous for his military campaigns. In Middenland he is feared for his great purges in the beast-infested forests. Furthermore, his victories against the Bretonnians and in Marienburg have made him well known throughout the Empire.\"\n\"I do not mean his military fame, but his honor. We do not want to risk Kislev's scarce resources on weapons that will never arrive, or that fail at the decisive moment,\" the princess replied coldly.\n\"I do not know him well personally, but by his actions I believe he is an honorable man. The Ulricans do not usually name a fortress after someone they do not respect… and in the Drakwald there is one that bears his name. That alone is proof enough that he has left his mark,\" I answered.\n\"And is he someone prone to changing his mind?\" she pressed.\n\"That… well… that leaves me puzzled,\" I admitted. \"From what I know, he is aggressive, even violent. It is said he enjoys being in the front lines hunting minotaurs without showing the slightest fear. At the last banquet, when he was threatened, I thought it would end in blood and steel. But to my surprise, he showed himself far more calm and calculating than I expected. Of course, the Emperor and I agree he is an intelligent man… though also given to his fists.\"\n\"I see. Thank you for the information. Perhaps we will purchase weapons, then. The burning of so many Kislevites in Marienburg made me think the same as you: that he was too violent a man. But perhaps I was mistaken,\" the princess replied, turning her gaze back to the shooting trials.\nI watched the tests closely. The Kislevite weapons had power, yes, but at the cost of too much black powder, which limited their practicality. None of them exploded, fortunately, though their consumption was excessive compared to the others. Ignoring, of course, the dawi weapons, whose accuracy was unmatched, crafted with a care bordering on perfection… but impossible to produce at the scale the Empire required.\nFinally, it was the turn of the Prince of Marienburg. He arrived with his retinue of soldiers and gunsmiths, bringing with him a great number of weapons that would be put to the test.\n''Welcome, what surprises do you intend to dazzle us with?\" I said, clasping my hands as his men prepared the equipment.\n\"To begin with, this is one of my finest creations. Well… a joint creation with my dawi friends,\" said Albrecht, showing a paper bag containing something. Immediately, many leaned closer with curiosity.\n\"What is it?\" I asked, bending forward to see the contents.\n\"Nothing extraordinary… just a powder far stronger than black powder, and which produces no smoke.\" The Elector Count tore open part of the wrapping, letting fall onto a wooden table a grayish dust, lighter than common gunpowder.\nBefore I could utter a word, one of his men brought forth a burning torch. The dust ignited instantly… and vanished without leaving almost a trace, no smoke, as if the very air had devoured it.\n\"What a marvel! What a magnificent creation!… This must be the result of decades of dawi research…\" I exclaimed, astonished at the improvement to black powder that so many had sought for generations, and which now, finally, stood before us.\n\"Indeed,\" replied Albrecht with a smile brimming with pride. \"It is a dawi creation, which they sell only to me due to our great friendship. But I believe I can convince them to sell it to the rest of the Empire for the right price. This powder leaves barely any residue, avoiding tedious cleaning of the barrel, and is also far more powerful. So powerful, in fact, that it requires steel cannons to keep from shattering to pieces.\"\n\"May I… see more? Surely you have reserves, don't you?\" I asked, resisting the urge to snatch the paper bags hanging from his belt.\n\"Plenty more,\" he replied. \"My weapons have used smokeless powder for months now. And at last, I intend to sell it to the Empire… for a fair price.\" He placed several bags upon the table, which I eagerly opened to examine.\n\"Could you explain its composition? If you allow me to deliver it to the alchemists of Nuln, we could begin mass production after some preliminary testing. You would, of course, receive a commission for your creation.\"\n\"That is a secret between the dawi and me,\" he replied firmly. \"I cannot share it. I offer only to sell part of my production intended for the Empire.\"\n\"Come now! You cannot do this to me… This breakthrough must be known, written in the books of every university. It cannot remain locked in a family secret,\" I insisted, nearly begging.\nThe prince did not reply. Instead, he turned to one of his armorers. \"Mathias, please show them your new creation.\"\nThe man unwrapped a bundle covered in white cloth and revealed a musket with an ignition system I had never seen before.\n\"Flintlock mechanism,\" explained Albrecht. \"Far more reliable than the wheel lock. Faster and more precise ignition. With Sigmar's blessing, this shall be the future weapon of our armies.\" He handed me the musket, already loaded by his men.\nI remained silent, studying every detail. Then I passed it to one of the marksmen, who began the test. Shots thundered across multiple ranges, piercing effectively through the armor of the test mannequins. Every gaze was fixed upon the weapon.\nBut the greatest surprise came afterwards. They brought forth a wheeled weapon, not part of the competition but a demonstration of his personal armorer. It was the multi-barrel cannon I had heard so many rumors about. The prince's men turned a crank, and in a deafening roar it began firing. Multiple projectiles spat out in continuous bursts, tearing apart the mannequins wherever they struck. They reloaded, swapped magazines, and the storm of fire did not cease until four had been consumed.\n\"I need one of those… I need to study it…\" I whispered, hypnotized by the machine.\nI turned, searching for the Prince of Marienburg. I found him conversing with Princess Katarin, surrounded by ambassadors from Tilea and Estalia, all trying to negotiate arms purchases.\n\"So then, Prince of Marienburg, would that musket be the one sold to us?\" asked the princess.\n\"No,\" replied Albrecht. \"That is a new model that must first serve the Empire. Although, if it were rejected, I might offer it to Kislev.\"\n\"Then what would you sell us?\" pressed the princess.\n\"An older model, with a wheel lock. More complex, requires greater maintenance, but it was enough to conquer Marienburg.\"\nI could not hold back any longer. \"And the cannon? What would you take for that multi-barrel cannon?\" I interrupted suddenly.\n\"Ah… I see you were dazzled by my armorer's creation,\" the prince replied, calm, almost amused. \"It is a secret, and I want it to spread first under my family's control. Only the Emperor could decide otherwise.\"\n\"I must understand it…\" I murmured, almost pleading.\n\"Perhaps we can speak further later,\" he allowed with a cutting smile. Then he turned, ignoring me, to continue speaking with the ambassadors.\nI remained there, trembling with anxiety, and the only thought that haunted me as I walked back toward Nuln were his words: 'Family… family…' And my eyes turned toward my daughters.\nIf not through the beauty of Emmanuelle, then I shall have to resort to Leos. I can no longer serve Emmanuelle's whims unless I manage to bind his advances to the University of Nuln.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The gods had blessed our clan with a true dawongi, an ally of our kind in spirit, who had protected us tirelessly during the harsh recovery of our Karaks. Now the time had come to repay that debt—and repay it as only the dawi know how.\nThe dawongi had entrusted us with the most colossal task any clan had received in generations. Even with the twenty thousand dawi who inhabit my halls today, never had we undertaken such an enterprise. Our ally had secured an agreement with the men of the Empire—an arms deal of colossal proportions—but he lacked the means to produce on the scale required by his plan. Thus, he placed his trust in our hands and our craft, asking us to raise, beside his laboratory, the greatest forge and armament manufactory complex the umgi had ever laid eyes upon.\nThe chosen site was on the slopes of the Grey Mountains, by the river dividing the fertile lands of Reikland from the western marshes. The water would power the great wheels and feed the steam boilers that would drive our machinery. To the dawi engineers, this was no obstacle, but rather a challenge worthy of their talents.\nThe only factor that held us back were the runesmiths, for their hands were still occupied with the great order of rune-armors and rune-blades we had only recently completed. Yet, since the rediscovery of ancient tomes of our lineage, the rune-clans had come to my Karak in droves, eager to learn and preserve the art of the ancestors. Never before had runes been forged with such speed, never before had we gathered so many trustworthy engravers beneath a single roof.\nWhat the dawongi asked for was no mere umgi forge, but a titan of stone and steel. Five hundred square meters for specialized machinery: drills for steel, rifled molds, presses and assemblers for the firing mechanisms of firearms. Another five hundred meters of roaring forges dedicated to producing the highest quality steel, ceaseless and relentless. All of it powered by a network of boilers running through the complex like veins of fire, distributing steam to every workshop and hammer.\nOur wisest engineers would design mechanisms no umgi could even imagine, and our runesmiths would carve countless protective runes: against demons, and against the inevitable mistakes of human labor. A colossal task, yes—but for the honorable dawi people, no more than another step on our road to glory.\nAs soon as the order was given, I set every worker of my Karak to the task, along with the newcomers from other Karaks of Karak Ankor. Many sought a new home where they could raise stone halls; others hungered to learn the secrets of the ancestors.\nResources were no obstacle, for our umgi allies provided all we could not extract from the mountains. Thus, we could dedicate ourselves fully to the construction.\nI often walked the construction zones to inspect the progress. Not a day passed without stumbling upon a great umgi military camp: hundreds, thousands of soldiers training relentlessly, preparing for another campaign of war. They ran, fought one another in friendly duels, marched in formation. Always there was movement, always the metallic clamor of swords and shouted commands.\nI often saw my dawongi among them, practicing swordsmanship with his officers or leading the formations, as if that entire army were but an extension of his will. I did not know his goal, but we knew we had to deliver his armors and blades before he embarked on his next war.\nDuring one of my regular inspections, while overseeing the moving of stone and the construction of walls and steam pipes, I decided the time had come to bring him the last shipment of his order. Thus, with all possible care, we loaded the great chests of rune-steel and marched toward the military camp.\nUpon arrival, I saw the young umgi drenched in sweat, pushing their bodies to the limit.\n\"Come on… come on! If it doesn't burn, it's useless. Push until your body breaks, and then give one more effort!\" roared my dawongi, striding among his exhausted warriors.\n\"One more, damn you! One more! Fight as if it were your last battle, as if you had to convince Sigmar himself that you are worthy of his blessing!\" he bellowed, leaning over a soldier who could barely stand.\nWhen he saw me, he left the group and approached, wiping the sweat from his brow with a cloth.\n\"Durán. Good to see you. Tell me, are there problems in the tunnels? Any threat beneath the mountain I should know of?\" he asked with genuine concern.\n\"No, my dawongi,\" I replied. \"I only come to deliver one of your previous orders. Our runesmiths have finally finished the armors you requested. Now they will focus on building the great factory. Given its size, it will take time, though we have many workers.\"\nI gestured to my men, who were unloading heavy ornate chests filled with pieces of rune-steel.\n\"Excellent… these will be most necessary for what is to come,\" he said as he lifted a mail shirt in both hands, examining every link with care. \"A masterpiece. I could expect no less from the dawi… your craft is unmatched.\"\n\"Where will you lead your warriors, dawongi? Will you need mine to accompany you on your march?\" I asked.\n\"My steps will take me to Bretonnia,\" he replied firmly. \"I have been entrusted with the honor of leading the Imperial vanguard. We shall crush the knights and, with some luck, free the Bretonnians from the yoke of their decayed nobility and their false worship of the Lady.\"\n\"May my ancestors guide you in that campaign, and may you return alive, my dawongi,\" I said with solemnity.\n\"Thank you… With some luck I'll return alive—and with more gold to order even more of these armors. I'll be needing them in great numbers sooner or later,\" he replied, pausing for a moment. Then he looked me directly in the eyes and added: \"But speaking of future plans, Durán… there is something else I want to ask you first.\"\n\"Always willing to speak with you,\" I answered with a faint smile.\n\"I have plans for when my Bretonnian campaign ends, if Sigmar allows,\" said my dawongi seriously. \"I want to secure some of the Imperial borders and then launch a campaign to the south, to aid the dawi in their struggles with the goblins and the thagoraki. But I am troubled… Do you think my help will be welcomed? I know many times the dawi consider unasked-for aid an insult, and I would like your opinion on this.\"\n\"You intend to travel south to free the Karaks? Such as Karak Eight Peaks or Karak Drazh?\" I asked in disbelief.\n\"That is my intent,\" he replied, fixing his gaze on the distance. \"I have had terrible visions of the future, and in many of them the dawi appear weakened, forced to fight too many battles at once. Incapable of lending their full strength in the great war against our enemies. That is why I consider it wise to send my men south, once this short war with Bretonnia is concluded… but here lies my dilemma: do you think the dwarf kings will look kindly on an umgi's intervention in the internal affairs of our people?\"Thɪs\n\"I do not believe there is a king who would reject the aid of such an honorable umgi,\" I answered firmly. \"On the contrary, once they know it is you who leads this enterprise, they will be overjoyed. Your name is already celebrated in our mountains for the recovery of my Karaks. All the dawi lords will open the doors of their halls to you and shower you with honors.\"\n\"Good…\" my dawongi sighed. \"Because the greatest challenge in that venture will be logistics. Fighting against the southern princes, the greenskins, and whatever other spawn dwell there will be hard. For that I will need the support of the local Karaks. And if they could provide their aid with the airships, all the better. I know the dawi possess aerial fleets, and with their help we could move my men and resources directly into the heart of the campaign, instead of hacking our way through every enemy-infested valley. We would save thousands of lives.\"\n\"I can speak with some kings I am in contact with, to try to secure those air transports you ask for,\" I said with a smile. \"Only some Thanes and kings have access to them, but I am certain we can secure them for when you are ready for your new campaign in aid of the dawi people.\"\n\"Excellent news… Then I hope the Bretonnian campaign is short, so we can once again focus on protecting our allies and striking the threats that hinder the recovery of the dwarf people. With some luck, we will be ready for that campaign,\" concluded my dawongi.\nAfter the conversation, I watched as the umgi warriors began receiving the rune-armors, fitted to their sizes and assigned only to my dawongi's trusted men. At a glance it was clear they were chosen warriors, hardened and disciplined, who within moments were already testing their armor under the weight of steel and rune.\nI remained watching a while longer, as they practiced maneuvers and battle tactics. They formed tight blocks of spears and pikes, withstanding the charges of mounted umgi trying to break their formation. It was a curious sight: the discipline of my kind, mirrored in men, under the gaze of a leader who seemed to mold them as steel in the forge.\nWithout delay I sent messengers to all the kings I was in contact with, to gather what my dawongi had requested. If he was willing to march south to fight for the dawi without asking anything in return, I could do no less than give my utmost to ease his campaign. Thus, our efforts redoubled: the factories began to rise at an unceasing pace, and the production of weapons for the Bretonnian campaign became our absolute priority.\nEvery umgi we received and equipped for that war meant one more warrior in the south, when the time came to face the goblins and the thagoraki in the battles for our lost Karaks. That is why, nearly every day, I descended to inspect the progress of the great factory. First we concentrated on the boiler hall, the heart of the complex, to ensure the machines would begin working as soon as possible. Within months that essential sector was complete, and the first machines for casting cannons and assembling muskets already roared with the breath of steam.\nThe less critical sections of the factory were adapted to house hundreds of umgi workers, who began laboring in continuous shifts, day and night. For this we used our glowing stones, which lit the workshops without rest. Work stopped only when the machinery needed calibration. Soon, production reached staggering numbers: crates filled with firearms left every day, destined for the armies of the Empire.\nAt the same time, the orders for powder from the dawongi multiplied. He had begun selling it to the umgi, but used Sigmarite priests as intermediaries. He wanted no necromancer or Imperial wizard to gain access to the substance, nor for their crude magic to profane the secret of his family's creation.\nWith each passing day, the factory drew closer to completion. By the following year, the umgi armies were already marching toward the lands of Bretonnia. War was at the gates, and in the deepest part of my heart, I hoped the heirs of Sigmar would return victorious… so that they might fulfill their promise to march south and aid my people in reclaiming our lost Karaks.\n------------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It seemed Luitpold had achieved something almost unthinkable in these times, when the Empire faced a war. Yet here we were, with nearly forty thousand men from every province, and just as many reinforcements expected in the coming months.\nLuitpold had summoned all the Imperial troops a year in advance, just as he had proclaimed that day at the banquet when he spoke of uniting the armies of all provinces. Though it seemed his true intent was to catch the Bretonnians off guard.\nAll signs indicated that the Bretonnians had made a near-desperate attempt to reclaim Montfort, to prevent the Imperial army from securing a firm foothold in Bretonnian territory. But they had failed. They besieged the fortress for weeks, until snow forced them to withdraw. With so many peasants conscripted, their harvests had suffered, and with supplies running low, they could not sustain a winter campaign. On our side, however, it was not so calm: a necromancer attacked a Bretonnian village occupied by Imperial forces, but with the aid of the Wood Elves we managed to drive him back—along with beastmen wielding strange weapons that must have been Skaven.\nMeanwhile, Reikland's harvests had been the most abundant in years. Even compared to the previous one, already abundant, this year's had increased by more than thirty percent. A record harvest that once again swelled our reserves of food.\nAlmost all that surplus would surely be consumed by the campaign, since I myself had mobilized fifteen thousand men, and with nearly ten thousand guards still under my command, I had close to ten percent of my population under arms. Something unsustainable, if not for the record harvests and high employment rates in my lands.\nIn recent months, birth rates continued to rise, which was a problem, since children represented nothing but expense until the age of fourteen, when they could finally contribute value. Fortunately, the cost of keeping them was not an issue for the moment.\nRegardless, I had recruited heavily in recent months, thanks to the gold from Marienburg. I had spent all that plunder repairing the city, demolishing useless sections and expanding its infrastructure, so that Marienburg would become a true Imperial port rather than a mercenary haven. This brought me enormous monthly income, charging rents and taxes from merchants who came to trade. And I still had the advantage of paying no tribute to Luitpold.\nIn addition, I now sold arms and powder to the very Count of Reikland, ensuring that it was the priests of Sigmar who handled the smokeless powder, so that no Gold Wizard might attempt to unravel its production. Realistically, I doubted they could produce anything anyway, unless they spent years attempting to manufacture nitric acid—and even then, likely to blow their own faces off when trying to nitrate the cellulose.\nBut I had a well-trained army. For months I had drilled both new recruits and veterans from my past campaigns, all eager to test themselves in Bretonnia. And most importantly: they were all equipped with the new flintlock muskets, having practiced pike and halberd formations time and again, ready to repel Bretonnian cavalry.\nIn recent months, together with Hieronymus, I had been conducting all manner of magical experiments, trying to increase my affinity with Chamon—above all, to control my attraction to the Winds without depending on the elven amulet. By using my Sigmarite amulets, I could test how much I had improved without the elven artifact, discovering to my surprise that even without it I could slip unnoticed past one of the best magical detection amulets in the Sigmarite cult's possession. Something incredible, considering I could even cast minor spells of low energy without triggering the amulet. Major spells, of course, still revealed me immediately.\nWhen wearing the amulet, however, I could use mid-level spells capable of killing several people at once without the detection artifact exposing me. A vital advantage for the future.\nBut my greatest progress—and what even left Hieronymus bewildered at the creativity of my approach—was learning to control blood, both mine and that of others, manipulating the iron within it through Chamon. With my own it was easier; with others, incredibly difficult. Yet I discovered I could close wounds, stop bleeding, even block arteries to cause death—though so far only in theory; Bretonnia would provide the testing ground. Most recently, I had developed the ability to sense people through their blood: the more I practiced, the stronger the signal became, to the point where I could, with eyes closed, perceive the flow of blood moving within a body.\nEven so, in the military camp we awaited the arrival of all the important figures for this grand campaign. Chief among them was the Imperial Prince Karl Franz, who I had been told would come to join the expedition.\nOne day, as preparations for the campaign were underway, a detachment of the Reiksguard arrived escorting the Prince, who rode an Imperial warhorse. All the high nobility gathered together to receive him. In his hands he carried a great parchment.\n\"In the name of my father, the Chosen of Sigmar, Emperor Luitpold von Holswig-Schliestein, Elector Count of Reikland, Prince of Altdorf, I thank all those present for answering the call to arms of the Empire for this campaign,\" said the Prince, opening the parchment and beginning to read.\n\"By order of the Chosen of Sigmar himself, the leadership of this army and of all Imperial armies in Bretonnia is granted to the Elector Count of the Westerlands, Prince of Marienburg, Albrecht von Reinsfeld, in recognition of his experience and knowledge of Bretonnian territory from previous campaigns… With Sigmar's will, he shall lead us to great victory.\" He finished his words, dismounted from his horse, and handed me the parchment. \"Do you accept this honor?\"\n\"I thank the consideration of our Emperor, the Chosen of Sigmar, and I gladly accept this honor of leading the Empire's coming great victory in Bretonnia,\" I replied, taking the parchment while feeling the weight of many eyes upon me.\n\"Good. General, there is something we must discuss about the Imperial plans for this campaign,\" said Prince Karl Franz.\n\"Then accompany me, Prince, to my tent, where we can speak calmly,\" I answered, turning as the Prince followed me along with some twenty members of the Reiksguard.\nUpon arriving, they found the maps I had gathered from my days in Bretonnia. I took a seat in one of the chairs, while the Prince did the same, and little by little more members of the Reiksguard settled inside.\n\"So then, Imperial Prince, tell me: what are the wishes of your father, the Emperor, for this campaign ahead of us? That way, we may take the best possible decisions,\" I said with a smile.\n\"Father wants the campaign to end with the conquest of Gisoreux and to secure the Grismerie River as a frontier with Bretonnia, placing a noble there who will be fully responsible for its defense and for putting an end once and for all to Bretonnian attacks on Imperial soil,\" the Prince replied.\n\"To conquer only a duchy? Do they not wish to go further? Or are we trying to be conservative here?\" I asked, staring at him.Googlᴇ search NovᴇlFirenᴇt\n\"The more territory we conquer, the harder it will be to administer, since it would remain an active frontier against Bretonnia. The ideal would be to secure a peace treaty once the rivers are established as the border. Besides, many nobles will fight among themselves to claim those lands, as already happened here. Much of the chaos in Montfort, and the failure of the previous campaign in Gisoreux, stemmed from nobles competing over who would take the city to later claim it in court. The war could have ended much earlier,\" the Prince explained.\n\"After that, Father wants us to turn our forces against the greenskins in the mountains and attempt to hunt down the necromancer who attacked last year. Many Imperial soldiers died in that battle,\" Karl Franz continued.\n\"Very well, I think I can do something. Instead of conquering more territory, he wants us to secure the borders, which in itself is very good for the Empire. But striking through Bretonnian defenses directly would not be very intelligent: all their forces must be concentrated there to fight us, since that is clearly the most obvious point where they would expect a blow,\" I said, examining a map of Gisoreux.\n\"Then what will the plan be? You have around sixty thousand men available for this campaign, outnumbering the Bretonnians if the previous general's estimates are correct,\" Karl Franz said, running his fingers across my maps.\n\"I plan to strike at Quenelles, to the south,\" I pointed at the map.\n\"That goes against my father's orders, Elector Count of the Westerlands,\" Karl Franz replied.\n\"Do you think I will march directly where all the Grail Knights and Damsels have gathered? No… We will strike where they are undefended. We can build a simple bridge over the Grismerie and cross swiftly into Quenelles, in a matter of days, without alerting the Bretonnians too much. Then we begin to attack a territory the Imperials were not expected to target, and thus left without defenses. What do you think the Bretonnian king will do when he sees that a duchy he thought secure is being invaded?\" I asked with a smile.\n\"They will have to move to defend it,\" replied the Prince.\n\"Exactly. They will have to move. The march of Bretonnian armies is slower than that of the Imperials, unless it's only the knights traveling. And if they attack us in Quenelles with only cavalry, without their thousands of peasants, they will be easily defeated. But what I truly want is just that: for them to move. They will have to cross south, and when their armies meet ours in Quenelles, we will withdraw. That's where we will use our numerical superiority: sending an army of some twenty thousand men to seize the Grismerie crossings, controlling all the bridges and forcing them to go around the river to reach Gisoreux,\" I said, tracing the map.\n\"If we are quick, we could complete the conquest of the city before the Bretonnian army arrives. A victory gained without the need for a pitched battle, if possible,\" I concluded.\n\"An exceptional plan… but what if the Bretonnians do not move from their positions and completely ignore our presence in the south?\" asked one of the Reiksguard officers of note.\n\"The Bretonnian code of chivalry would not allow them to leave their lands undefended. But if they did, we can always burn and sack every shrine of the Lady we find, forcing them to come. We can conquer their castles and keep moving, taking more ducal seats until they are forced to react. If the king remained idle while losing castles without resistance, I would not doubt the Grail Knights themselves would throw him from the throne,\" I answered calmly.\n\"That must be avoided, since what we seek is future peace with Bretonnia, not a prolonged war consuming Imperial resources. When this ends, it will be Reikland that funds most of the effort, and we do not want to maintain an extended conflict against the Bretonnians. We lack the means to administer and defend more territories right now. First, we must secure the borders against greenskins and beastmen. This unity of the Empire must be used to cleanse our lands of those threats before thinking of a campaign that overextends our frontiers,\" said the Prince.\n\"So it shall be, Imperial Prince. But for now, we will proceed with my plan to distract the Bretonnians. Have your men prepare—we march at once to Montfort to begin our campaign,\" I concluded, smiling as I began to gather the maps.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

They only withdrew not long ago, and I wasn't about to risk my men working in the snow. I was waiting for spring's warmth to begin the work,\" the general answered clumsily.\n\"Idiot. Do you not know there's a necromancer in the Grey Mountains we need to hunt down, and you leave hundreds of Bretonnian corpses ready for him to raise into his service? Are you so stupid that you can't see it?\" I shot back, glaring at him.\n\"The winter cold here is severe, it wasn't feasible…,\" he tried to reply.\n\"Oh yes, of course. Much better to wait until we have a horde of corpses devouring our soldiers, with brothers-in-arms rising against us,\" I responded, folding my arms.\n\"I'm doing what I can. I barely keep a few men who still obey me; the ravens we keep in the castle do nothing but fight each other. The nobles refuse to risk their numbers and have sabotaged every attempt to impose discipline,\" the general said with an air of defeat.\nI turned to the prince, who was watching everything with great attention.\n\"Rebellious nobility… infighting… what happened?\" I asked again, looking back at the general.\n\"I lost control quickly when the nobles began bribing my captains to expand their influence. My first intention was to strike at Gisoreux: if we took the city, we'd secure the river and cut reinforcements to Parravon. But the nobles wanted to secure Parravon first, as it was more fertile and easier to defend. They forced me to yield. After crushing the local duke and pushing north, we ran into the full Bretonnian host gathered together. It became impossible,\" he confessed.\n\"So it wasn't a tactical mistake… the nobles had you as their puppet,\" I answered with contempt.\n\"What could I do if my own men no longer obeyed me?\" he defended himself, raising his hands.\n\"Looks like we've got plenty of troublesome nobles. This is going to be a serious problem, don't you think, Imperial Prince?\" I said, turning to Karl Franz.\n\"Many of our forces don't answer directly. Fifteen thousand are yours, ten thousand serve my father. The rest belong to nobles who brought their personal troops. The problem will come when reinforcements from the Elector Counts arrive. Reikland will send another ten thousand in the coming months, and in total we expect sixty thousand more. It's likely we'll have to give in somewhat to noble politics,\" Karl replied.\n\"Bah… nobles are either cowards or fools. You only need to scare them enough to obey you. And if they're the latter, they'll accept a duel; then you beat them to death in front of everyone, so they see what happens when someone disobeys,\" I answered coldly.\n\"That would only serve temporarily, Elector Albrecht. We must ensure they join us and don't conspire out of hunger for power. A few promises and some rewards will win them over, avoiding disunity. Brutality would only isolate you in court,\" the prince replied calmly.\n\"Perhaps… but I don't care. Honestly, my political power is already sufficient: gold, weapons, and loyal soldiers. I don't need other nobles. I have no time for endless negotiations. I prefer methods that guarantee immediate obedience. The sooner we begin the maneuver, the sooner we'll have our great victory,\" I replied, mounting my horse to head toward Montfort's fortress.\nThe ascent path was deserted; most of the inhabitants had been taken to Reikland as prisoners, making the place more defensible in some ways.\n\"What happened to the Duke of Montfort and his family?\" I asked the general walking at our side.\n\"He remains a prisoner, though without chains. He was released months ago to be treated according to his rank. As long as the campaign isn't secured, his death could cause diplomatic trouble when negotiating peace,\" he answered.\n\"So that dog still lives,\" I muttered as we ascended. Imperial soldiers were scattered throughout the fortress, though few truly acted as guards.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nWhen we reached the great hall, we heard shouting: nobles quarreling, as always.\n\"That's how it is every day. They fight over anything: sending patrols, garrisoning castles, reacting to raids from Bretonnian warbands… always arguing over plunder and prestige, never in silence,\" the general explained wearily.\n\"If you wish, I could try to mediate between the nobles and convince them to set aside their differences. I only need some time,\" the Imperial Prince intervened.\n\"Don't bother, Franz. Better stay away from me and let them see you as the voice of reason. I'll give them the fright of their lives,\" I replied, stretching my arms and cracking my knuckles.\n\"Franz…\" said the Prince, raising a brow at me.\nI smashed the hall doors open with a kick, flinging them wide so violently they nearly rebounded, the crash thundering through the chamber. The noise alone was enough to silence the nobles, who until then had been shrieking at one another like barnyard hens. They turned at once to face us.\n\"WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT, GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGS? STOP GAWKING AND SHOW RESPECT TO THE IMPERIAL PRINCE!\" I roared as I strode heavily toward the throne still in its place. A noble occupied it, seated with false dignity. I walked straight toward him. Before I could reach him, the coward leapt to his feet and fled, escaping before I could drag him out by force—ruining my plan of humiliating him publicly.\n\"Very well, you pieces of trash. I know exactly what you've been doing while playing with the lives of Imperial soldiers,\" I continued, letting my voice thunder through the hall. \"I'll tell you directly: I am in command. If I hear of any schemes or attempts at internal sabotage…\" I took a step forward, locking eyes with each noble one by one, \"…I will make sure it is your last act before you draw your final breath in Morr's garden.\"\nI kept walking slowly, letting my words sink in.\n\"So, unless any of you has something else to say, you will send your men immediately to collect the bodies of the dead Bretonnians and prepare them for Morr's priests. There is a necromancer loose in the Grey Mountains, and I will not hand him a ready-made army of fresh corpses,\" I ordered in a severe tone.\nSilence spread. The nobles glanced at one another, waiting for someone brave enough to state the obvious. No one wanted to be the first to take a fist to the face.\nFinally, one stood up. A noble of Talabecland; I did not recognize his heraldry, but embroidered on his clothing were the words \"Deus Taal,\" a clear display of his faith.\n\"By what authority do you come here to demand of us, servants of the Empire and of the gods?\" the noble exclaimed firmly.\nI smiled immediately. Just what I needed: a victim. I advanced toward him without a word. The difference in size and weight was obvious, yet the man did not show fear. We stood face to face. Then I seized him violently by his clothes and, with all my strength, hurled him against the table in front of him. Wood cracked under the impact, and before he could react I drove my elbow into his throat, pressing down with all my weight.\nThe noble struggled, scratching helplessly. His face reddened as the air left him. I lifted him for an instant and slammed him back onto the table, drawing a strangled groan as blood spilled from his nose. The hall remained in absolute silence.\n\"BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE EMPEROR… FILTH! You will obey and carry out every one of my orders, or next time I will have your head cut off for insubordination!\" I finished, driving my elbow into his abdomen, wrenching another near-agonized moan from him.\nAs the noble writhed on the floor, curled in pain, every eye in the chamber was fixed on me.\n\"And this goes for all of you. If I give an order, you obey. Heads will roll for insubordination… is that clear? Now get out there and collect the Bretonnian corpses before I decide to test my sword's edge on your necks,\" I said in a cold tone that chilled the air of the hall.\nSlowly, some nobles began to rise and leave in silence. Then the rest followed quickly, each trying to avoid my gaze. Even the Talabeclander noble, staggering and dragging his feet, stumbled toward the exit.\n\"Von Mackensen… wait outside. We'll talk later,\" I ordered, fixing my eyes on my old guardian, who had tried all this time to avoid my sight.\nIn the end, only the prince and the members of the Reiksguard remained, standing firm.\n\"See? Simple,\" I said as I wiped blood from my gauntlet. \"This was one of my father's first lessons: a bit of muscle and the right threat, and every coward who doesn't want to be next obeys without complaint. No one wants to end up in a duel that could cost their life and the humiliation of being remembered as a criminal for insubordination.\"\n\"A bit… brusque, honestly,\" the Imperial Prince replied, keeping his composure. \"This could have been discussed. Though I must admit, the speed with which you brought them under your command has been… remarkable.\"\n\"As I told you, most nobles are either cowards or too proud. If you smash their faces in public, they're humiliated. It's better for them to be in the group that obeyed silently than to be remembered as the example. Let them scheme about stabbing me in the back—it doesn't matter. As long as they remember what awaits them if they step out of line, everything becomes easier,\" I answered with a smile, removing my helmet.\n\"So, what next? Cleaning up the dead and giving them Morr's rites?\" Karl asked.\n\"Yes. And afterward, we'll organize trusted men in Montfort to patrol and hold the garrison. We'll cut off a few heads of corrupt captains who took bribes, lash some sergeants who sold out, and put those soldiers who refused to answer their state armies in the front line. Then, we'll begin construction of a bridge into Bretonnia and prepare our defenses while the Bretonnians are forced to move south,\" I answered decisively.\n\"Are you going to punish the troops?\" the prince asked, serious.\n\"If I don't, they'll think they can take bribes without worrying about consequences. Well, here are the consequences. I won't tolerate noble politics in my army, much less a lack of discipline or loyalty. I'll make it clear that they now answer to a general who won't allow the slightest attempt to weaken the army's readiness,\" I replied, walking toward the exit.\nAs I left the hall, I came across familiar faces. \"Well… well… well… If it isn't my old favorite guardian, Margrave von Mackensen. And Joachim… what a pleasure to have you here,\" I said with a smile heavy with intent.\nBoth exchanged a look in silence. The Margrave remained stern, though Joachim no longer looked as nervous as I remembered.\n\"Hello, Albrecht,\" Joachim said calmly.\nHis father looked at him sternly, clearly uncomfortable with his son's familiarity toward me.\n\"A pleasure to see you again, Margrave,\" I continued, fixing my gaze on him. \"What happened between us is in the past. I hold no grudge.\" I saw him widen his eyes, surprised at my words. I inclined my head slightly and added coldly, \"But don't test me… because I will not hesitate to take your head.\"\nI took a step forward, closing the distance. \"Gather your men and set them to patrolling Montfort. We have much to do. As for your son… I need him as my aide, if you have no objection.\"\nThe Margrave nodded immediately, repressing any reply. \"No… general, no objection,\" he said in a grave voice, and at once descended to the lower levels of the fortress.\nI turned to Joachim, placing a hand on his shoulder.\"Come on, friend. We have much to do now,\" I told him as we returned to the great hall.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Montfort felt like a whirlpool of blood and confusion, a perpetual chaos where every day dozens of Bretonnians and Imperials fell in the skirmishes. At first, in our naivety, we thought the war would be little more than a march: we would take Montfort, perhaps Gisoreux, and everything would fall under the control of our families. But it all unraveled in ways none of us had foreseen.\nWith so many Imperial nobles present, each one hungry for plunder and glory, the internal disputes became as fierce as the battles against the Bretonnians. The men of Talabecland demanded the offensive be pushed toward Parravon to honor Taal in the forests, while those of Middenland thought only of securing the gold mines of Montfort. Fights broke out even among allies, arguing over which house should claim the best lands or resources. To make matters worse, much of the local population had vanished before our arrival, leaving the mines nearly empty and fueling even greater greed to control them.\nThe greatest quarrel of all was Gisoreux. A large, wealthy city, close to Montfort, rich in silver and gold, and with an immense peasant population. The nobles licked their lips thinking of the wealth it must contain and the tolls they could levy on Marienburg's merchants for crossing the pass. Ambition blinded them.\nDefeat came to us suddenly. I myself nearly lost my life in that charge against the Bretonnian knights, where we inflicted many casualties until those cursed damsels intervened. The entire battlefield turned against us: flocks of birds, wild beasts bursting from the forests, nature itself rising to halt our advance. It became impossible to maintain unity. Middenland, Talabecland, Reikland, Stirland, Averland… each contingent began acting on its own, launching isolated offensives that were swept aside with ease by a Bretonnian army more united than ever. We lost our momentum and retreated until we were entrenched.\nSince then, it has all been endurance. We gained nothing beyond defending the little we held, while every day more Grail Knights arrived to reinforce the Bretonnians. The pressure was unbearable; our Imperial knights were outmatched, forcing us to shelter behind Montfort's walls. And with much of the Imperial army distracted in Parravon by a necromancer, we found ourselves surrounded and besieged.\nFortunately, the siege did not last long. The Bretonnians lacked supplies, though their constant assaults and cannons pounding day and night robbed me of sleep for weeks.\nAnd then came the army that rescued us. I never would have imagined it would be him commanding it.\nAlbrecht… that brat I used to torment before his rise. I always saw him as stubborn and brutal, and now that same nature had made him a feared general. He gave Josef von Behring of Talabecland the beating of his life. No one could stand against him. What had been endless disputes among nobles ended in minutes, replaced by whispers of poisoning or of persuading Prince Karl Franz to remove him.Google seaʀᴄh Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nThe idea of dueling him died the day Albrecht decapitated a noble without hesitation after being challenged. From then on, no one dared try again.\nI will personally never forget the Stirland noble who did. To challenge Albrecht in those conditions… knowing he was taller, stronger, better armed, and protected with runes. That was not bravery—it was a conscious suicide.\nAt last, we regained the order we had lost. We once again saw the discipline that had marked the first day of the campaign, when the Imperial army marched toward Montfort. Patrols returned to the roads, garrisons to their posts, and a firm presence was established against the Bretonnians, for we all knew an offensive would soon come.\nThe walls were adorned with the bodies of twenty-five Imperial captains, men who in life had been little more than pawns in the nobles' struggle for power. Each had sought to control as many state soldiers as possible to increase influence in the army. Their boldness was paid in blood, and their corpses hung for days as a warning.\nThe sergeants fared no better. Several were publicly flogged before their men for corruption and taking bribes. The ill-gotten coin was confiscated and handed entirely to the state soldiers who had remained loyal, untainted by intrigue. It was Albrecht's way of making clear that discipline and loyalty stood above any personal ambition.\nMeanwhile, I had become the general's assistant. My duty was to deal with nobles who tried to enter the council chamber, each bringing their \"recommendations\" and plans, but always with an eye for personal gain. Most of the time, my task was to tell them no in the most diplomatic manner possible. Though there were exceptions: the son of the Elector Count of Wissenland appeared often, and he could not be ignored, forcing me to deal with him far more than I wished.\nAfter several days of stockpiling supplies, preparations for the new campaign began. That was when Albrecht confided the attack plan to me. We would build a bridge near Parravon to cross the Grismerie River quickly and establish a blockade at the foothills of the Massif Orcal. The bulk of the army would march south with the aim of raiding Quenelles. It was predictable that the Bretonnian knights would attempt to intercept us along the narrow strip of Bastonne beside the river.\nThere, with batteries of cannons and Imperial muskets, we could hold them off for several days. The idea was to force the Bretonnians to fight in ground less favorable for their cavalry charges, closer to the mountains, where the open space diminished and our tactics could prevail. With a solid blockade and the threat looming over Quenelles, we would drive them to fight on our terms.\nAnd so it happened. Some Imperial patrols began improvising a bridge over the river, lashing together the locals' fishing boats with planks and ropes. It was a precarious construction, but firm enough to allow the passage of men and horses in small numbers. And, by Sigmar's grace, the Bretonnians did not notice our maneuver.\nThe next day, a force of ten thousand soldiers crossed and began raising a wooden fortification at the foothills of the Massif Orcal, in lands crawling with greenskins. In little time we had palisades, ditches, and artillery positions. There, a new kind of weapon was deployed: a multi-barreled cannon, operated solely by Albrecht's personal troops, alongside nearly nine hundred riders armed to the teeth with pistols, though their armor was reinforced only on the front of their bodies. It was no fortress worthy of Helmgart, of course, but solid enough to halt a Bretonnian advance while the bulk of our forces marched against Quenelles.\nTo my surprise, Albrecht had vanished from the area. Prince Karl Franz, remained as second-in-command in the siege of Quenelles, while I was appointed commander of the blockade at Bastonne. My task was to direct the defense while trenches were dug and the Reikland musketeers were positioned. Around me toiled without rest the men of the state regiments who had once been punished for corruption: men who had taken bribes were now sweating blood in the trenches, forced to redeem themselves through hard labor before facing the coming battle.\nEvery day I had to ensure the works matched Albrecht's plans. To be honest, the man might be the finest duelist in the Empire… but drawing, that was not his art. His diagrams looked more like secret codes than fortification plans. Still, I think we managed to interpret them well enough.\nMeanwhile, hundreds of Bretonnian peasants were brought across the river every day. There were days when thousands crossed, especially after we razed Chammonay and later Perrche. The defense of those lands had been minimal—barely a few hundred knights, unable to stop the thirty thousand Imperial soldiers marching with a thirst for victory.\nThe siege of Quenelles was short and brutal. By the fifth day, the walls gave way under the unrelenting pounding of artillery, and the general assault was ordered. Two Grail Knights tried to hold us in the castle, but they were cut down, and with their fall the city was ours along with a fortune in plunder. For a moment, the nobles nearly lost control, eager to push toward Aquitaine to exploit the Bretonnian rout, but the prince intervened just in time. He reminded them of what would happen if they defied orders—and the mere fear of Albrecht was enough to herd them back into line.\nInstead of rebelling, the nobles spent themselves scouring every village and hamlet of the duchy. The result was devastating: Quenelles was bled dry, its towns empty, as all the peasants were transported to our side of the river to be resettled in the Westerlands. Albrecht only wanted the peasants, nothing else. The rest of the loot was divided as usual, but for the general, the peasants alone were the true payment.\nFor days, Quenelles was laid waste. Only the Lady's shrines were left standing. Finally, our scouts the other side of the river reported the Bretonnian armies were beginning to gather on the other side of the Grismerie. Alarm spread throughout the camp.\n\"Bretonnians are coming! To your posts!\" I shouted with all the force of my lungs. \"Handgunners, take position! Infantry, form ranks! Where in Sigmar's name are the cannon crews?\"\nThe men of Reikland, Westerland, and the punished state regiments began to move, filling trenches and parapets. That was when I saw, incredulous, Albrecht's cavalry charging at full speed.\n\"What the hell are doing…?\" I muttered, watching them disappear toward the horizon, where the Bretonnian cavalry had not yet fully appeared.\n\"Relax,\" said one of the gunners as he slid a steel piece into the chamber. \"They're going to harry them. They'll be back.\" His comrade nodded, then glanced at me calmly. \"Ready.\"\nI forced myself to stay composed as messengers on horseback galloped to Quenelles to summon back the troops still plundering the last villages of the duchy. Before long, we heard the thunder on the plain and saw Albrecht's riders returning, galloping at full speed, firing pistols point-blank into the Bretonnian knights chasing them. The maneuver had worked: many Bretonnians lay wounded, and, more importantly, their cavalry lines were charging in disarray.\n\"Hey…\" said the gunner at my side.\n\"What?\" I asked, distracted, never taking my eyes off the front.\n\"If you're going to stand here, wear this.\" He handed me a piece of cloth dampened with a dark powder. \"Our lord says breathing this is dangerous.\"\nI didn't argue. I tied the cloth over my face, imitating the gunners, and settled to watch the fight from the safest vantage.\nAlbrecht's cavalry came back after sowing chaos among the Bretonnians. They had managed to drive the knights into a disordered charge.\n\"Too few,\" the gunner muttered, his hand on a crank. \"Wait for them to bunch up. We won't waste ammunition in vain.\"\nAt his signal, the Reikland handgunners opened fire. The knights who had gotten close were cut down before they reached the palisade. A few fell so near their bodies ended up hanging over the stakes.\nThe silence didn't last. Within minutes, a larger host of knights appeared on the horizon, this time in a tight wedge, ready to crush the Imperial infantry behind the defenses.\nOf course, they still had to break through the palisade. They might have tried to skirt the blockade through the hills, but the terrain was treacherous and unsafe. That was when we saw her: a Bretonnian mage advancing at the head of the wedge.\nSuddenly, the ground quaked beneath her spells. Thick black roots burst from the earth, tearing the palisade apart as if it were straw.\n\"Damn it…\" I growled, watching as our strongest defense vanished in seconds.\nThe Bretonnians wasted no time. They launched their charge, hurling their horses against our lines. But at that very instant came a deafening roar: Albrecht's multi-barreled cannons.\nThe air filled with fire. A storm of projectiles swept the plain, tearing the leading riders to shreds. The charge collapsed in on itself, horses and men falling atop one another, tangled in chaos.\nI covered my ears, but still the roar of the artillery shook through my skull. I caught sight of one of the gunners turning the piece directly toward the mage, and soon all the cannons were firing at her. The gunners worked like madmen, reloading again and again, unleashing volleys that shook the very earth.\nAfter multiple barrages, the Bretonnians began to retreat, leaving behind a field littered with corpses and dying horses. We could still see them in the distance, regrouping.\nWhat followed was a long, grinding skirmish. The Bretonnian sorceresses hurled everything they could at our positions: gales, wild beasts, roots that tried to rip out our trenches. And the gunners answered with equal fury, firing every time one of them dared show herself over the enemy line.\nIt was a battle of attrition. Each day we endured their witchcraft, and they suffered under our ceaseless fire.\nBut when all the troops had finally crossed the Grismerie, we received the order to withdraw. That night, we crossed back over the river and destroyed the bridge. The next day, we watched the Bretonnians cross, only to find the entire duchy plundered and desolate.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Our scouts had clearly seen the Bretonnian army beginning to move south, no doubt alerted by their messengers that the Imperials had crossed the Grismerie and launched the offensive toward Quenelles. For them, stopping that attack was the priority, and they wasted no time in moving the bulk of their forces, leaving behind the peasants who could barely keep pace.\nThat was when I saw the opportunity. With the Bretonnians gone, I marched north immediately with my personal forces—around eighteen thousand men—and borrowed every cannon I could from the Imperial army. This time, there was no need to rely on my gifts of Chamon; better that the siege be won with powder and steel, without arousing suspicion with every miracle that opened the walls for us.\nThe advance was swift. Every village we passed through was nothing but a ghost town. These were settlements already ravaged by earlier raids—empty houses, collapsing roofs, nothing left but rotten husks of what had once been Bretonnian hamlets. At times, they had served as temporary shelters for their rearguard, but now all that remained were blackened stones and rotting beams.\nEvery bridge we found was destroyed one by one. Wooden ones went up in flames within minutes; stone ones were reduced to rubble under cannon fire, their remains dragged away by the current. I would leave no crossing behind us. The Grismerie would be a wall of water between the city and any reinforcements.\nAfter two days of uninterrupted marching, we stood before the jewel: Gisoreux. The city rose solid and proud, but we outnumbered it five to one. It was only a matter of time. I immediately sent detachments to secure its three gates and ordered the bridges linking it to Bastonne and Artois destroyed, leaving the city completely isolated.\nWe wasted no time. The camp went up—palisades, watchtowers, and positions for sixty cannons, all aimed at the same section of wall. We also raised assault ladders on purpose, so the defenders would think we planned a frontal attack and concentrate their men there. When I saw them crowding the walls, I gave the order.\nThe thunder of the cannons shook the earth. Shot after shot slammed not only into the stone but into the packed defenders on the battlements as well. With a little aid from my magic, the projectiles struck true, tearing through the wall guards who could barely respond. I saw bodies hurled from eight meters up, breaking against the ground, others crushed under falling masonry. For hours the bombardment was relentless. The air reeked of gunpowder, mingled with the screams of Bretonnians tumbling from the walls.\n\"Good. Punish those walls,\" I ordered the Nuln gunners, who answered with discipline, loading and firing without pause. Slowly, the stone began to crack, though to my surprise the walls still stood.\nI frowned, incredulous. \"How in Sigmar's name are they still standing after such a pounding?\"The source of this content ɪs NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nThat was when I felt it. A magical presence—no, several. I extended my hand and called for a spyglass. When I looked into the city, my suspicion was confirmed: four glowing auras within. Cursed Bretonnian sorceresses.\nI saw clearly as massive roots burst from the earth and gripped the walls, holding the stone together like colossal arms, keeping them steady despite the fractures. They weren't trying to defeat us; they only meant to stall for as long as possible.\n\"Damn it…\" I muttered. \"There are witches inside the city, and they won't let those walls fall. They're trying to buy time for Bretonnia's main host to return and break the siege.\" I lowered the spyglass, cursing under my breath.\nI thought of a quick solution. I could have tried to strangle them with my power, but the four were too close together. Killing them all at once was impossible—one counterspell would ruin the attempt.\nSo I chose something greater, something none of them could stop. I closed my eyes and began to trace the earth beneath Gisoreux. After a few moments, I found it: a mineral vein running under part of the city. Not vast, but enough for my purpose.\nI made it vibrate, fracturing the rock, heating it until it began to melt and weaken the hidden foundations of the city. Then I felt it—more than stone, a cavity beneath Gisoreux. The vibrations spread, and the ground began to roar.\nThe horses screamed as if Morr himself stood before them. Some soldiers fell to their knees, others lifted their eyes to the sky, thinking it divine punishment. The roar of the earth surrounded us.\nThe walls shook, cannons rattled in their carriages, and my men stared at me with terror in their eyes. Slowly, we watched entire streets split open, buildings collapsing, and part of the city beginning to sink. That was what I wanted: an entire section of wall crumbled, though part of the ditch filled with the same soil and stone torn down by the tremor.\n\"Sigmar's blood, what the hell was that!\" one of my men shouted, eyes fixed on the city as whole houses vanished under clouds of dust.\nSuddenly, I felt two of the magical presences vanish. I sought their traces and found them buried under tons of rubble, blood seeping beneath the ruins of a fallen castle tower that had blocked one of the inner roads. The other two sorceresses still lived, struggling to aid their entombed companions.\n\"Don't waste this chance! Clear the rubble from the wall and prepare an entry into the city. Bring mantlets forward and advance in small groups!\" I ordered.\nMy men split into firing squads, pushing forward reinforced wooden shields that four soldiers lifted like giant walls, shielding themselves from the arrows that still fell from the battlements.\nDespite the chaos within Gisoreux, the fires, and the collapsing buildings, the defenders clung to their walls with fanatic resolve, fighting as though it did not matter that half their district was burning or buried under their feet.\nOur musketeers managed to get close enough to the walls to begin harassing the defenders in a constant duel of projectiles. Meanwhile, we started to shift part of the siege camp, moving the cannons into new positions and trying to get them back into service as quickly as possible.\nThe exchange of fire never ceased. Lead balls whistled against the battlements as we continued to advance little by little. Inside the city, the sorceresses began to act against us, though they didn't seem intent on destroying us directly. Instead, they used their power to bolster the morale and endurance of the Bretonnian warriors, pouring all their magic into them.\nEven so, we slowly gained the upper hand. More and more defenders fell from the walls pierced by gunfire, and many survivors began retreating to deal with the fires consuming entire districts inside the city. The blaze, sparked by the tremor I had caused, spread uncontrollably through the wooden houses, devouring everything in its path.\nThat forced the Grail Damsels to shift their magic from the warriors to the flames, desperately trying to put them out. Without their support, the Bretonnians began to falter, abandoning the walls and leaving them nearly undefended.\nWe did not waste the chance. At once, we began clearing rubble from the breach. Men and beasts worked tirelessly, hauling stone after stone. Smoke from the burning city mixed with the dust of shattered walls. If we didn't break through before nightfall, the Bretonnians would build barricades inside the city, forcing us into street fighting that could drag on for days—costing far more lives. But I couldn't demand more of my men, exhausted after a day of marching, construction, and now the siege.\nAt last, we cleared enough space to make an entry. We formed columns and began moving into the city. The first line took defensive positions inside merchant houses, their windows offering ideal vantage points to fire into the streets. Slowly, we secured the first blocks.\nUrban fighting erupted quickly. It reminded me of Marienburg, though much simpler. The Bretonnians had only bows, and those arrows I could deflect with a mere gesture, while my men's weapons were vastly superior. The echo of muskets thundered down every alley, and the smell of powder mixed with the smoke of the fires.\nThe sun was nearly set and the fighting still raged. I pushed my men to keep pressing; I couldn't allow the battle to drag into another day of siege. The defenders fell back step by step, searching for stronger positions where they could rally, but it was clear their line was breaking.\nThen I saw her. One of the Grail Damsels appeared in the midst of the fray, leading the defense. Ten Grail Knights surrounded her, dismounted, forming a circle of steel to guard her. She raised her hands and began to cast.\nI was faster. Alone, she was an easy target for me. I closed my will around her throat. I saw her clutch desperately at her own collar as it dug into her flesh, her lips whispering prayers that would never be heard. Her eyes widened, her magic unraveled in sparks, and she dropped to her knees, kicking weakly until she collapsed lifeless on the ground.\nThere was no time to waste. I placed my best soldiers for a decisive assault: five hundred men, all armed with muskets, runic armor, and runic steel blades, formed in three tight lines down one of the main avenues of Gisoreux. Ahead of them, the Bretonnian redoubts, still resisting with fury.\nThe column advanced with flawless discipline. The earth rumbled with the steady, unified march of five hundred boots, men shoulder to shoulder, their rhythm unbroken. Arrows rained from the rooftops, but they bounced off the runic plates as if they were twigs.\nThe Grail Knights, seeing the threat, charged in desperation, crying out the name of their Lady. They surged like a wave of steel and faith, determined to shatter our line.\n\"Fire!\"\nThe three ranks of musketeers halted, aimed in unison, and pulled their triggers all at once. The detonation was deafening, a single blast that split the evening in two. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Bretonnians fell in an instant. Horses collapsed, men riddled with shot, the front line of their charge dissolved as though it had slammed into an invisible wall.\n\"For the Empire and for Sigmar!\" I shouted, raising my runic sword, gleaming in the fading light.\nAnd we charged. My men surged forward in fury against the disoriented Bretonnians, who could scarcely comprehend what had just happened to their ranks. Imperial discipline and steel hammered down upon their confusion.\nThe defenders tried to regroup once more, but were struck with brutal force. The runic steel of my men cut through Bretonnian armor like butter, carving paths through their resistance with ease. We surrounded the Grail Knights, who still fought with monstrous strength. Each one could hold their ground against several warriors at once, but now they faced seasoned soldiers, armed with runic swords, protected by armor as fine—or finer—than the Lady's chosen.\nI cut down three Bretonnian peasants who stumbled into my path. Then I hurled myself with animal fury at a Grail Knight already locked against three of my men. My sword met his in a brutal clash that shook the air. He blocked my thrust, barely dodging the strikes of my soldiers, but he had no time to react when I slammed my boot into his foot. He toppled backward with a crash of steel, and in an instant my men pounced on him. They pinned his arms and legs like hounds, while one drove a dagger straight through the visor, piercing his eye.\nThe knight writhed like a maddened beast, kicking and roaring, until blood poured from his helm and his movements ceased.\nThe scene repeated again and again. My soldiers hurled themselves en masse against the Grail Knights, dragging them down amidst screams and steel. Others rammed into them with their bodies, tackling them, while sheer numbers did the rest. Each knight had to fight ten men at once, some pinning their arms and legs, others forcing daggers into the joints of their armor or even into their throats, shoving the blades deep beneath their helms.\nThe remaining defenders, seeing the Lady's chosen fall, began to flee, while the rest of my army spread through the city, hunting down survivors. Yet no matter how hard we searched, we never found the last Grail Damsel. It seemed she had escaped.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

It isn't hard to get into the heads of those knights: everything in their vows revolves around protecting the lands granted to them. It was obvious that, once the chance arose, they would rush to defend the duchy, leaving this place nearly stripped of defenses. Of course, there were still many Grail Knights and Damsels… but luckily, that tremor shattered the walls and set the city aflame.\"Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn\n\"Lucky,\" the Imperial Prince muttered, raising an eyebrow.\n\"Luck is a commander's best tool,\" I answered calmly. \"If you don't have it, you'll lose every battle where victory isn't certain. So yes, that makes me a better general than the rest.\" I leaned back further in the duke's throne, enjoying the comfort of the seat.\n\"Well then, General, what now? We have the Emperor's objectives, but this campaign was expected to last a year or more… and we conquered these Bretonnian territories in barely a month.\"\n\"It depends on where you want to strike,\" I replied, rising and spreading out some captured maps. \"We have the entire river course to harass them. If we start building bridges and force them to split their forces, we could crush them one by one as we advance. Not a bad idea—but it depends more on the Emperor's will than mine.\"\nKarl Franz bent over the maps, speaking seriously. \"It would be better to stop here. We don't want a coalition forming against the Empire simply because we're conquering more than we can hold. Controlling these lands will already be hard without peace with Bretonnia, so it's wiser to open diplomatic channels and negotiate a lasting agreement.\"\n\"They'll be hard to convince,\" I admitted. \"But let's hope you can work your magic with words. If something needs crushing, just tell me and I'll do it. I can do almost anything… except face the Bretonnians in open battle. That would be suicide. With so many sorceresses, winning under those conditions would be near impossible.\"\n\"Just make sure the walls of Gisoreux are rebuilt,\" the prince countered, \"so we can use them as defense against a Bretonnian host. I'll try to get our diplomats to prepare the way toward peace. But for now, I want to discuss your reward for this campaign… and I expect the next step to be another victory—this time against the greenskins and in the hunt for the necromancer.\" He rose and took a seat in another chair in the hall.\n\"I'm all ears,\" I said with a grin. \"It's never a bad thing to be rewarded for being very skilled in war. And I do hope it's one of the good rewards. But obviously, that will come when everything's finished. I can get some dawi who know methods to destroy greenskin spores, to prevent them from reappearing the following year. If you want, I can request them. That would make the campaign against them far more effective.\"\n\"That will be very necessary,\" replied the prince, \"but I also want your opinion on who should hold these Bretonnian lands—or any we secure in a future peace treaty. Your preference could easily be taken into account.\"\n\"Come now, Franzi… do you think I'm fool enough to ask you to hand me these lands?\" I laughed openly. \"I'd have to spend a colossal fortune just to guard the frontier against Bretonnians and possible greenskin incursions. To defend the border properly, I'd need thirty thousand men mobilized at all times, garrisoning ducal castles and watching the river. And given my population, my lands are underpopulated as it is—I need workers, not more soldiers tied down to garrisons. If not for my master of agriculture, I'd likely have trouble with the harvest after mobilizing so many of my peasants.\"\n\"So that's why you're taking all the Bretonnian prisoners as your property…\" Karl Franz looked at me with clear disapproval.\n\"Of course,\" I replied without hesitation. \"Bretonnians are hardworking, loyal, and adaptable. They have everything a good worker needs. I need hands—many hands—tilling the land tirelessly to secure the biggest and best harvests, while still raising an army for defense. Because I'm expecting the Norscans to pay us a visit. And Marienburg's navy is… less than reliable; the sailors of the republic can't be trusted. So I'll have to put my own men on ships… and for now, it isn't going well.\" I stretched my arms as if it were just another minor nuisance in my long list of problems.\n\"Then who do you recommend to hold the position of protector of the Bretonnian frontier? Someone must take it to defend it properly,\" said the prince, crossing his arms as he studied me.\n\"I already told you,\" I answered. \"The ideal would be to integrate these lands directly into the Emperor's domain. The nobles who took part could be rewarded with money, not titles. By keeping direct control of the resources, you'd secure the gold mines of Montfort, the fertile lands of Parravon and Gisoreux… and little else here is truly worth much. You could leave administration to minor nobles or sell exploitation rights, but ultimate authority should remain with a Reiksguard general, under military governance. That would increase your father's power within the Empire, and if you also grant the Elector title to the administrator you choose, you'd have an Elector appointed by your hand alone—one who owes loyalty solely to the Emperor.\"\nKarl Franz sighed, furrowing his brow. \"It's tempting, but we can't. Too many nobles would protest. Too many men died in this campaign, and we can't send them home empty-handed. Most expect lands here in Bretonnia for their second sons, to establish cadet branches of their houses, or at least some domain they can claim as their own.\"\nI looked at him sternly. \"If you keep thinking that way, you'll never unify the Empire under a single Emperor. If you only dedicate yourself to pleasing the Elector Counts, they'll go on ruling while the Emperor juggles to maintain the appearance of authority. This is your chance to prove who truly commands the Empire: the Emperor… or the Electors.\"\nKarl Franz let out a snort, reclining in his seat. \"I'll take it into consideration. But what you propose is difficult. If we do that, we might lose all the support we've gained among the Electors. Right now, the Empire is at the height of its strength: all the provinces are working together in the war. To risk that for a few lands with barely any peasants… I don't know if it's worth it.\"\n\"Believe me, it will be. The Emperor's authority must be stronger than that of the Electors,\" I replied, rising from my chair and putting away the maps.\n\"Very well, back to our earlier conversation… what is it you want as a reward for this campaign? So I can take it into account when I speak to my father,\" the prince asked with genuine interest, rising and walking toward me.\n\"I don't need more lands; I need population to settle the ones I already hold. So I want another colonization permit—but not of land, of gold. Permits to recruit state regiments about to be disbanded… and all the Bretonnian peasants from the captured territories. I understand that Parravon has a large peasant population, ready to be moved into my domains before the plowing season begins. That way, I'll be able to work the lands we recovered from the marshes,\" I answered at once.\n\"Are you certain of this? You only want peasants for your lands? You'd be moving hundreds of thousands of people into your domains,\" the prince said, eyeing me with suspicion.\n\"And even so, they'd remain underpopulated,\" I replied, folding my arms. \"I have more land than I have hands to work it. That is what matters most right now.\"\n\"I see,\" Karl Franz muttered, rubbing his thumb across his forehead. \"Let's see what comes of it for now.\"\nThe following days were quiet—too quiet. We only busied ourselves with taking the castles of Gisoreux that still held out for the Bretonnian king. We took our time crushing those small fortresses while the rest of the army reorganized.\nSeveral days later, we finally saw the Bretonnian host. They had reached the river, seeking a way to cross into Gisoreux, only to realize the bridges were destroyed and there was no quick way to pass into the new Imperial frontier without exposing themselves. To cross, they would have to risk the currents or search for a shallow ford.\nSo we remained, face to face, in a contest of stares. Every day the same: they on the far bank, we repairing walls, moving Bretonnian peasants into my territories, and keeping the garrisons alert. There was one attempt in the north, where the river was shallower; a group of knights tried to cross, but we met them with a volley of muskets that kept them from setting a single foot on solid ground.\nThe month dragged slowly. We weren't idle, but neither did we fight any great battles. My routine was reduced to watching the river, coordinating garrisons with the nobles… and scaring them from time to time when they whispered too loudly about poisoning me.\nAt last, a ceasefire was negotiated. Imperial diplomats managed to reach the new Bretonnian king and arrange the end of the war. They spoke of restoring friendly relations—or something resembling it—after so much blood had been spilled on both sides.\nThough I was present at the negotiations, my role was more ornamental than real. I had little understanding of what the diplomats and the prince were doing with their endless discussions that led nowhere, only to resume the next day with the same words and conditions. Day after day I had to sit and watch them repeat the same game, agreements collapsing again and again, only to be revived with the very same arguments.\nAt least the direction of the talks always favored the Empire. The goal was clear: consolidate total control over Bretonnian territory. The envoys of the new king tried to impose demands: that we return some lands, that we allow the people of Quenelles—an emptied city, stripped bare by our nobles—to return.\nBut we all knew that was a desperate attempt to salvage what little they had left. The Bretonnian army could still fight, yes, but their resources and morale were broken. And worse for them, they knew more Imperial reinforcements were coming soon. Under that shadow, their negotiators began to accept increasingly humiliating terms: no new incursions against our borders, recognition of the Imperial right to maintain garrisons in key fortresses, and even permission to create state institutions similar to our Witch Hunters, tasked with purging the corruption that rotted their nobility.\nThat had been the true casus belli of the war: the high corruption of Chaos and the vampiric influence spreading through Bretonnia. It was that poison which had moved the Imperial army in the first place, and so it was only logical that it became the hardest condition to impose in the negotiations.\nFor endless days, the Bretonnian diplomats tried everything to avoid the issue, deflecting the conversation, delaying agreements, repeating the same arguments over and over. It was clear that accepting such a condition would be a humiliation to them: to admit they could not cleanse their own lands and needed outside help to do it.\nBut in the end, after many tedious days of dull repetition, the agreement was made. Bretonnia officially ceded three duchies to the Empire, recognized the Imperial conquest as legitimate, and committed to establishing its own order, similar to our Witch Hunters, to eradicate vampiric and Chaotic corruption within their borders.\nI was content. I had obtained what I wanted: a vast influx of new laborers for my lands. That guaranteed harvests, production, and the ability to continue raising an even greater army. Yet still, I could not return home.\nDuty compelled me to keep marching: first against the greenskins, then against the necromancer, and later into the lands of the dawi. So even though this campaign was done, much remained ahead—too much blood to shed, too many enemies to crush—before I could rest.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Remember, your father gave me authority over the Grey Mountains in my own name… technically, the dawi could say they live in my lands. Of course, in practice, they keep their realms and I keep mine. In return, they send me a 'gift' each month for allowing them free mining rights. It would be absurd for either of us to pretend a human lord rules over a dawi lord.\"\n\"Then let's go receive them,\" said the prince, walking toward the tent's exit.\nOutside, we saw hundreds of dawi assembled before the camp, perhaps close to a thousand. All armed, bearing their banners, and among them I even noticed the fearsome Slayers: hair dyed orange, bare torsos covered with blue runes painted onto their skin.\n\"Friends of the Empire, thank you for coming so swiftly,\" I called out as I walked toward them. \"Your aid in this campaign will be the most important of all. We have a task that only the dawi can accomplish, with the skill and patience needed for work well done.\"\n\"You have nothing to thank me for, my dawongi,\" answered a familiar voice. From among the warriors emerged Duran, clad in a new runic armor gleaming with elegance, crowned with a helm that made him seem a few inches taller.\n\"But if it isn't my good friend Duran!\" I exclaimed, extending my hand. He clasped it firmly. \"Tell me, is everything well in the mountains? Do your Karaks still hold? I don't want to take your time—I know how busy you must be with so many dawi migrants arriving in your domains.\"\n\"My Karaks are in good hands with my kin, dawongi. But I could not turn a deaf ear to this call. As you did for my clan when you helped us against the urk and the grobi, now we return the favor against this plague that troubles our umgi allies.\"\nKarl Franz watched the scene with clear interest, and I could see the surprise written on his face.\n\"Duran, Karl Franz, son of Sigmar's Chosen. Karl, Duran, thane of the clan allied with my family,\" I made the introductions.\n\"Greetings, umgi. I hold no grievance against you,\" said Duran, raising his shield as a sign of respect.\n\"Greetings to the honorable warriors of Karak Ankor,\" replied the prince with poise. \"It is an honor to have you at our side in this campaign to cleanse the Grey Mountains of the greenskin clan that has caused such harm to Imperial caravans.\"\n\"That said, my friend,\" I turned to Duran, \"your journey must have been long. It would be an honor to host you under my care while we finish our preparations before marching against the greenskins.\"ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\n\"On the contrary,\" Duran said with pride. \"I expect you to sit at my table tonight and tell me the story of your victory against Bretonnia. They say your cunning defeated an entire people, but I want to hear it from you, with the best Bugman's beer I could get.\" He pointed toward the great wagons piled high with dwarfen food.\n\"Tempting…\" I admitted, remembering with a pang of hunger those dwarfen sausages I had enjoyed so much. \"But I must refuse. I cannot grant myself luxuries I deny my men.\"\nDuran's chest swelled with pride. \"Then you shall drink with us when the victory against the greenskins is won. There will be a feast, and we will all raise our mugs.\"\n\"Count on it,\" I replied with a smile. \"Though remember, I don't drink.\"\n\"I know. But at least you'll tell us the stories then.\"\n\"Of course, my friend.\"\nI turned to the prince. \"For now, let them rest. We march tomorrow. They are welcome within my walls, though they may set up their own camp if they prefer.\"\nBack inside the tent, Karl Franz was still staring at me in surprise.\n\"Well then…\" he finally said. \"Will you explain what just happened out there? I've never seen a dawi so respectful or friendly. Not even the dwarfen envoys in Altdorf behave that way—not even with my father.\"\n\"It's an honest relationship built on mutual benefit,\" I answered, shrugging as I looked for a jug of water mixed with vinegar. \"I clear their Karaks of greenskins. I've cleared, I think, four of them… killing thousands of orcs and goblins in the tunnels. They return the favor with runic arms.\"\nKarl Franz looked at me in disbelief. \"Wait… we knew of one. But four? We never received reports of that. Since when did you recover three more Karaks in the Grey Mountains?\"\n\"Oh… well…\" I raised a finger, realizing the detail. \"I forgot to mention it.\" I covered my eyes with my hand, aware that once again I had omitted something important for the Empire.\n\"Do you do this on purpose, or what?\" Franz said, arching an eyebrow. \"It's impossible this happens so many times, always 'forgetting' to report your victories. It almost seems like you hate the prestige they bring you.\"\n\"No… I literally forgot,\" I replied with a smile. \"I have too many things on my mind, and I completely forgot to say I'd been helping the dawi with their Karaks. I'm surprised the envoys didn't mention it.\"\n\"Something tells me they thought we already knew,\" the prince muttered thoughtfully. \"Now that I think about it, there were moments when the dwarfen envoys were unusually cooperative… more than usual. Yes, that must have been it. The timing fits: whatever we asked, they answered with a 'yes' instead of the usual hard bargaining.\"\n\"Then it wasn't that bad. I suppose you got plenty of runic armor,\" I said after taking a drink of water.\n\"We could have taken greater advantage of that situation,\" said the prince, his reply curt.\n\"You want to take advantage of the honorable dawi people?\" I asked, feigning surprise.\n\"No, no, no. I never said that! Don't put words in my mouth,\" the prince replied, clearly unsettled.\n\"Unthinkable… that the future Emperor would want to exploit the dawi. Who would have thought,\" I continued, keeping up my mock surprise.\n\"You know very well what I meant. Stop saying things like that—I would never do such a thing,\" he shot back, nervousness showing.\nI shook my head, laughing. \"I think I heard exactly what you meant, Franzi.\"\n\"You are a…\" he clenched his teeth.\n\"Go on, say it… a son of a bitch? My mother was a terrible woman, and I don't care if people say it. But be careful with my father… for that I will break faces with my fists,\" I said with a grin.\nThe prince exhaled heavily, steadying his breath to rein in his temper. \"Fine. So what is your plan for the mountains?\" he asked at last, calmer now.\n\"Oh, come on, you're no fun. I wanted to amuse myself a little longer,\" I replied with a broad smile.\n\"This is neither the place nor the time. What matters is crushing the greenskins and hunting down that necromancer roaming the Grey Mountains before he raises another army of the dead,\" he said, composed again.\n\"Well then,\" I nodded, leaning over the maps. \"We have a general idea of where they are. Several trails show signs of recent movement, which means they must be nearby. Likely an underground clan using an abandoned karak… or perhaps they have a camp above ground. If it's the first, the fight will be brutal, with the risk of cave-ins if we use cannon fire. If it's the second, even worse: ambushes, attacks from every direction. And there's still lingering snow from winter—a landslide could be fatal.\"\n\"If you give me a few days, I can get pegasi from the Altdorf zoo, with expert riders as scouts,\" the prince proposed.\n\"An excellent idea,\" I answered immediately. \"That would save us much time. If they don't see a large camp, it means they're underground, and then we can search for hidden entrances beneath the rocks.\"\nWe finally agreed to wait a couple of days. There was no rush; after the last campaign, we were ahead of schedule, and we could afford to better prepare the troops and gather proper clothing for the mountains.\nDuring that time, I met with the dawi, who demanded to hear from my own lips how I had outwitted the Bretonnians. I told them the story, exaggerating a few parts to keep them entertained, and they used the occasion to drink in honor of the victory. As always, I drank only water with vinegar while they filled themselves with beer.\nThe days passed as we stockpiled gunpowder and supplies. I handed out extra clothing I had secured for the soldiers, so that the march through the mountains would not be sheer torment in the cold.\nAt last, the promised pegasus riders arrived. They took to the skies of the Grey Mountains, scouting every valley and ridge, taking turns so that the watch never ceased.\nNews came swiftly: the greenskin clan was encamped on the surface, in the mountains. Bad news—it would have been better to find them underground, where cannons in the narrow tunnels would have annihilated them. In open ground, on rough terrain, the battle would be far more dangerous.\nYet there was one advantage: the camp was poorly placed. There were hills and ravines where we could set up musketeers and cannons, and narrow passes that would force the orcs to attack head-on. If we moved quickly, we would be the ones choosing the field of battle.\nIn just two days, we hauled all the heavy equipment up the steep trails, bringing Imperial soldiers and the thousand dawi eager to slit orc throats. We positioned our cannons and stationed the troops between two hills, leaving a narrow pass as the only viable route for the greenskins to charge. And knowing that enemy well, I knew they would not hesitate.\nWith the army in position, I ordered noise to be made: a few gunshots echoed through the mountains. It didn't take long. Dozens of orcs appeared at the edge of their camp and, upon seeing us, began to charge immediately, roaring and swinging their massive crude axes in the air.\nThe first musketeers fired at once. Several orcs fell face-first into the dirt, but it was only a fleeting victory. Within seconds, more and more came. First hundreds of gleaming eyes in the gloom, then thousands, until an endless tide of goblins and orcs poured from their camp, flooding every access.\nJust as I had planned, most threw themselves down the few narrow paths, seeking the most direct clash. It was exactly what I wanted. They piled up in the choke point—right as the rotary cannons roared to life. Twenty of these machines thundered together, spewing fire and lead in unrelenting torrents. The greenskin vanguard was shredded like straw, mowed down by the inhuman cadence of the shots. Every second, dozens of orcs fell, and the deeper they pushed, the more they entered the killing field of our weapons.\nAs the pressure grew stronger, the dawi organ guns opened fire. A storm of shot and shrapnel tore through the greenskins, turning their advance into a bloodbath. Still, they kept coming—thousands upon thousands of green bodies shoving each other forward, dropping like flies under the disciplined volleys of our musketeers.\nThe volleys never ceased. Shot after shot, the smoke of gunpowder mixed with the screams, while the cannons of Nuln thundered with each blast, ripping away hundreds of foes at once and leaving crimson craters in the midst of the horde.\nEverything was going well, until I saw something odd. A group of goblins seemed to fly above us, propelled by crude metallic harnesses that launched them gliding toward our artillery.\n\"Damn it… flying goblins!\" one of the gunners shouted.\nI felt the metal in their harnesses. With a simple push of my power, I sent them veering off course, crashing into the slopes or plummeting to the ground, far from our guns. The artillery was safe, and the massacre continued.\nThe green tide kept growing, but the mountain of corpses before our lines was higher still.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Each cannon blast felled hundreds of greenskins; the mountains of corpses piled so high they began to block their own advance.\nTo my surprise, for once the orcs showed something close to tactical wit. After several minutes of one-sided slaughter, they realized they could not push forward head-on. They began seeking other paths: some groups climbing hills on the right flank, others forcing their way through rocky ground on the left, desperate to escape the killing field where the fallen bodies made it impossible to advance—and at the same time made it difficult for us to fire without striking the mountain of corpses.\nWhile I deflected the flying goblins with my power—launched by crude catapults, dangerous as living projectiles capable of smashing a formation on impact—I raised my spyglass to seek out the orc leader. If I could find him and strike him down, the entire horde might collapse. But there was no sign of him, only thousands of orcs and goblins surging from every direction. The tide kept growing, and though our firepower butchered them, their numbers still vastly outmatched ours.\nThen I felt it: Dhar. A stench of decay, like a foul breath on the wind. It wasn't close, but it was somewhere else in the orc camp. And in an instant, the greenskin reinforcements stopped emerging from their huts and tents, as if the tide itself had been cut off.\nThe scouts had already made it clear the orcs outnumbered us; it was far too soon for the battle to end. This could mean only one thing: the necromancer was here. It couldn't be beastmen, not in this region. That foul reek of corruption could only be necromancy.\nThe problem was how to explain it without looking suspicious. The logical assumption now would be to expect another orc wave. But with my magic I could feel part of the horde turning, changing sides. Orcs that roared one moment only to rise again the next, their eyes lifeless.\nWe need to burn those bodies before it's too late.\nI closed my eyes and tracked the source of the Dhar. When I found it, I tried to strike with Chamon, but failed. The necromancer was shielded: the metal of his gear was corrupted, fouled beyond measure, and my power could not pierce it.\nSo I changed tactics. I drew on the iron of the weapons carried by some of his undead. I sharpened that metal, shaped it into blades, and spun them in spirals, hurling them into their ranks. The effort was immense—I felt my medallions vibrating under the strain of my own magic clashing against his.\n\"Prince!\" I shouted, drawing Karl Franz's attention as he watched the battle from our vantage point.\n\"What is it?… your amulets are shaking,\" he said, frowning as he noticed my sacred artifacts resonating from the clash of energies.\n\"There's a wizard here. And if there is… you know what that means, don't you?\" I fixed him with a grave stare. \"The necromancer is among us.\"\nAs I spoke, I kept the iron blades whirling, hiding my gestures, blaming the enemy for what was in truth my own work. The necromancer tried to unravel my spells with his uncontrolled Dhar, burning through energy while I focused on one goal: snapping his neck before he could raise the entire sea of corpses against us.\nI poured every bit of my skill into sustaining the spell. The necromancer hurled counterspells one after another, weakening my iron blades, forcing me to spend more power just to keep them spinning.\n\"What do we do then, general? We've no battle mages, so we'll have to defeat him with sheer force,\" said the prince, scanning the battlefield for the invisible foe I had pointed out.\n\"We need to start burning the greenskin bodies. If the necromancer is here to exploit the battlefield and raise an army of undead, we've handed it to him on a platter. We must deny him that advantage immediately, before the orcs rise again under his command,\" I ordered quickly, straining to keep the blades from collapsing under his will.\nKarl nodded. The dawi, understanding the danger, advanced at once. A handful of greenskins still tried to reach our lines, but they were repelled while the dwarfen flamethrower units went to work. Orange flames roared across the slopes, enveloping the heaps of goblin and orc corpses surrounding the field. The stench of burning flesh filled the air as thousands of bodies went up in fire.\nBut it was already too late for some. Among the flames, half-charred bodies began to stir, rising on unsteady legs, skeletons with blackened scraps of flesh hurling themselves at the dawi gunners. The distraction had cost me—the necromancer had resumed his work, trying to raise every corpse he could reach.\nWith a growl I forced the blades back under my control. I shaped the iron again, spinning the edges tighter, and hurled them once more at his neck. The necromancer was forced to defend himself, pouring Dhar into makeshift wards, keeping himself occupied and, at least for a moment, preventing him from raising more dead.\nThe battle still leaned toward the greenskins through sheer numbers, but that was something we could not allow.\nThe mountains of corpses burned on, lighting the slopes like giant pyres. Through fire and smoke, I stepped forward, eyes fixed on my target. No matter how much I wore him down with blades, the only thing that would end this was a direct shot.\n\"We need to reach him… and blast his skull off with a cannon before he turns the whole mountain of corpses against us,\" I muttered, adjusting the spyglass to fix his position.\n\"Karl, we're going into the camp. If every greenskin in there becomes the necromancer's puppet, we're finished,\" I said gravely as I ran to rally men for the assault. There was no time to lose.\nI quickly gathered forces from allied nobles along with part of my own troops. We began marching, skirting the burning mountains of goblin and orc corpses. Some tried to rise among the flames, dragging charred limbs; others, whose bodies had not yet been touched by fire, stood again as skeletons or stumbling zombies—easy to predict and put down.\nIt was enough to divert a few companies to finish them off and clear a path, while the bulk of the formation pressed forward toward the heart of the greenskin camp. There, chaos reigned: whole hordes of orcs still fought ferociously, but many of their enemies were their own brothers, raised by the necromancer to swell his ranks.Google seaʀᴄh ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nWe kept pushing through the lines. Every yard cost blood. The undead hordes, made from the very warriors we had already slain, harassed us without pause. Worst of all was watching our own fallen rise again, hurling themselves at us with hollow eyes. Many men hesitated at the sight of comrades turned into abominations, but there was no room for pity. I shouted at them to keep moving, not to mourn the dead. If we lived, there would be time later to save their souls with the proper rites.\nAt last we reached the heart of the camp. The place was a heap of hovels, stakes, broken weapons, and greenskins shrieking their cacophonies of war. Yet all those cries were directed toward one figure: the necromancer.\nAnd there he was. Wrapped in black robes, his staff glowing with the corruption of Dhar—impossible to mistake. He stood as the storm's epicenter, surrounded by skeletal warriors clad in red armor, shielded by skeletal horsemen astride flayed steeds, wraiths of what once had been knights.\nI focused again. I could not allow him to keep adding corpses to his ranks. The logic was simple: it was better to face thousands of living greenskins than thousands of raised corpses, each one an enemy without fear or fatigue.\nSo, while our men secured positions within the camp, I unleashed my magic once more. I bent the iron of weapons into giant spinning blades, reaping scythes that tore into the undead ranks, all while making sure my own soldiers would not notice the true source of this power.\nThis time, the necromancer saw me clearly. His empty eyes fixed on mine, realizing I was the one behind the spells that had slowed him so far. All his focus turned against me, and I had to pour every attack directly into him. The Dhar he wielded was far stronger than the Chamon I commanded; if I gave him room to weave calmly, he could annihilate hundreds of my men with a single spell. I could not allow it.\nBy now thousands of Imperial soldiers had poured into the chaotic camp, trapped in a nightmare of three sides: greenskins, undead, and the Empire. For the orcs, it must have seemed like paradise—endless fighting, blood and screaming everywhere.\nThe musketeers opened fire on the necromancer's forces, though bullets were less effective against bone and rotten flesh. Still, the sheer volume of fire grew. Volley after volley, until cannons joined in, hurling grapeshot that shredded the tight undead formations.\nThen I saw it: a colossal skeletal knight, encased in blackened red armor and wielding a monstrous axe. He advanced like an unstoppable beast, hacking apart any greenskin in his path. Each swing split bodies in two, and the mere sight of that creature chilled even my veterans.\nThe necromancer, harried by bullets and shot, began to retreat. The cannons had driven him from the front, unable to withstand such punishment. We didn't see him flee entirely, but he fell back enough to limit himself to casting from afar, hidden within his ranks.\nI was ready to face the skeletal knight myself, raising my runic sword and preparing to channel all my power into the duel… when it happened.\nWith a thunderous roar, the orc warboss finally appeared—a hulking mass of muscle, iron, and fury, eager for battle. His tusks gleamed under a battered helm.\nThe greenskin locked eyes with me, then turned toward the towering skeletal knight… and without hesitation hurled himself against it. He roared, lifted his axe, and slammed into the undead giant with all his rage.\nI seized the opportunity. With a signal I gathered my best men and flanked around, aiming for the necromancer. Behind us, thousands of Imperials fought on, forcing their way through the relentless tide of corpses.\nWe reached one of the hills overlooking the camp, where the necromancer was retreating under waves of skeleton guards. From that height I saw him trying to escape in the confusion.\nI clenched my teeth, drew as much of Chamon's winds as I could, and with savage effort forged a spear of iron from the weapons of the surrounding skeletons. I hurled it with all my pent-up fury.\nThe necromancer sensed it at the last instant. He raised his hands, trying to block with a Dhar shield… but the spear pierced clean through his abdomen. The blow lifted him from the ground, pinning him into the earth. His staff rolled from his withered fingers as he writhed, clawing for it in vain—I unraveled the spear and caged the staff in iron.\nI wasted no time. With my men, we charged the skeletal guard. They moved slower, clumsier, as if the necromancer's wound was draining their strength. We cut through them like a hot knife through butter, smashing bone and scattering corpses.\nAt last I reached him. Before me was no mighty lord of death, but a cadaverous old man, sunken eyes full of hate. He opened his mouth, perhaps to curse, perhaps to cast… but I gave him no chance. My runic blade flashed and with one stroke I severed his head.\nThe skull rolled across the blackened ground. At that instant, the skeletal hordes collapsed like puppets with cut strings. The zombies fell in unison, lifeless, and the battlefield fell silent—broken only by Imperial war cries.\nThe strain took its toll. My legs buckled, and I collapsed, gasping, nearly unconscious from the drain of magic. I barely registered what happened around me; my men dragged me back into our lines.\nWhen I regained sight, I saw the aftermath. The orc warboss was dead, his head dangling from young Prince Franz's hand, while in the other he held a bloodied runic fang. Beside him, the skeletal knight's massive body lay still.\nWhen I finally recovered, skirmishes still lingered. Some orcs fought on, raging until Imperial troops and dawi cut them down. The air reeked of smoke, powder, and burnt flesh.\nThe first thing I did was erase all evidence of my magic. I destroyed the blades I had shaped, the iron shards still on the ground, and the metal shell around the necromancer's staff. I could not risk anyone discovering what I had done. With how far we'd been, no one should have seen it directly.\nMeanwhile, the dawi had already set to work with their usual efficiency. They lit enormous pyres and made sure everything—every corpse, every scrap—was reduced to ash. Then they brought in their steam machines to scour the land of orkish spores. We had won a two-for-one in this battle, but lost many men thanks to the necromancer.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The brute roared in triumph, celebrating his victory over the skeleton. While he was distracted, I stepped out of formation and with one stroke of my sword took his head clean off. Once the other greenskins realized their leader was dead, they quickly fled for their lives. They were soon pursued by the pegasus riders in the area and wiped out. Then we finished off the stragglers, so I'd say it was a good victory considering the circumstances—especially with the necromancer appearing out of nowhere,\" Karl said, seated and watching me.\n\"The damned necromancer must have been moving between battlefields, trying to raise an army from the countless corpses left unburied by war. It's no surprise he showed up here. When he sensed our battle, he probably saw it as the perfect chance to rebuild his army after the setback he suffered in the east,\" I said, rising despite the burn in my abdomen with every movement.\n\"Yes, that must be it. Sounds likely—especially after what we found when we arrived at Monfort: hundreds of unburied Bretonnians. He could very well have been searching for exactly that,\" replied the prince, thoughtful.\n\"Just make sure a priest of Sigmar purifies everything the necromancer used, and burn it all with cleansing fire. We can't risk another would-be necromancer raising the dead with his belongings. Everything must be purified and turned to ash so this area remains pacified,\" I said, setting my feet on the furs of my campaign tent.\n\"I already sent letters by pegasus to the nearest priests of Sigmar. They should be here soon,\" Karl answered calmly.\n\"And the dawi? Are they working on cleansing the area already?\" I asked, straining to sit up, feeling my muscles ache at even the simplest effort.\n\"If you mean burning every stone stump they see—yes. Since the battle ended they haven't stopped lighting pyres, then they bring a machine that pumps scalding steam into the cracks to purge everything,\" replied the prince.\n\"Good… that should make the greenskin problem vanish from this region for a long while, before they become a threat again requiring another army to clean them out. Now, tell me… how many did we lose? I know what I did was desperate, but if the necromancer had taken all those bodies and escaped, the entire Empire could have been in danger,\" I said, bracing for the bad news.\n\"About six thousand dead,\" the prince said gravely.\nI pressed my lips together at the high number of casualties. It was ten percent of the army under my command.\n\"Not a huge percentage, but I can see the number weighs on you all the same,\" Karl remarked, noticing my expression.\n\"Yes… it's something I can't shake. I overthink the consequences of my actions. I still feel guilty, even when I send warriors to certain death for a tactical advantage. Six thousand dead means six thousand families who lost someone—maybe even their only provider. Orphans, beggars… problems that ripple through society. Damn it… I'd give anything to kill that bastard again. But by now his soul must be suffering in a place worse than anything I could do,\" I said, giving myself a bit of grim comfort.\n\"Now I see why you govern well. If you weigh so many aspects beyond the loss of soldiers, it makes sense your towns turned into cities in just a few years—while it takes other nobles generations,\" said the prince, with a gesture of respect.\n\"I'm good with numbers, and I overthink things. Statecraft and war go hand in hand. That's why I'm a decent politician in that sense,\" I answered with a faint smile.\n\"Politician?\" Karl repeated with a sarcastic grin. \"I'd say you've barely more etiquette than the greenskins or the beastmen. You fall asleep in negotiations as if they don't matter… so I doubt that's true,\" the prince replied with irony.\n\"War, young prince… war is a continuation of politics by other means. And in that, I am a better politician than you. A diplomat must know how to wield the fear that the State's sword inspires—and that is something I do well. Look how I have these nobles in line, while all they think about is how to get rid of me,\" I said with a tired smile.\n\"A strange view of the world… but you certainly know how to lead armies. This would have been a great victory without the necromancer's presence, but it was difficult—if not impossible—to predict he would come to this region,\" said the prince, studying some maps.\n\"So then… do we have another mission from the Emperor, or am I released from my duty as general?\" I asked with interest.\n\"What's this? You sound like you no longer want the position of general… do you have other plans?\" asked the prince, fixing his gaze on me.\n\"Yes. To earn the respect of the dawi. I promised to travel south to aid in recovering some of their lost karaks. Duran, the dawi thane, has secured aerial transports for me to move part of my troops and join them in the reconquest. I don't intend to break that promise,\" I replied sincerely.\n\"Well… father wanted us to cleanse the forests of Reikland of beastmen. Leave them as clean as your lands… well, what's left of your forests. I hear they vanish more every day—to the dismay of Taal's cult,\" the prince said with a hint of irony.\n\"They can suck a lemon. Great forests are just breeding grounds for beastmen that never stop causing trouble: kidnapping people, performing rituals, breeding more monsters. While those tree-huggers cry over a few logs, we're preventing massacres in villages and stopping the people from being used as sacrifices, food, or broodmares,\" I replied angrily.\n\"Your position is quite clear, and well accepted by both the cult of Sigmar and that of Ulric. In fact, it is also my father's intent: that the forests of the Reikland be cleansed, so the land can be reclaimed for fields and pasture,\" Karl said firmly.\n\"That would be the most optimal… and what better than to build a nice railway line connecting all the cities of Reikland, eh?\" I said with a smile.\n\"Already thinking of making yourself richer?\" said the prince.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\n\"What makes you think I'm rich? I have high income, yes, but even higher expenses. In case you forgot, I have a sea of Bretonnians to whom I must build houses, drain swamps, work the land, provide tools, draft animals, fertilizers, seeds, mills… I'll burn through everything I have left on that. The Bretonnian loot barely covers a couple of months of my expenses,\" I replied.\n\"Impressive… you really think of everything… but I suppose we could give you some gold as a reward,\" said the prince, pensively.\n\"I'd rather have those peasants from Parravon I was negotiating with your father about. I was going to buy them, but nothing came of it—he was reluctant to sell me so many Bretonnians. He didn't want a province full of them. But now he has it… so what's the harm in a few hundred thousand more in my lands?\" I said with a grin.\n\"You claim you have almost no gold? How will you maintain those peasants?\" the prince asked, folding his arms.\n\"Let him grant them to me as a reward, and let them remain where they are until I need them. When I have more gold and land prepared to receive them, I'll bring them back. What matters now is that my lands are populated as quickly as possible with hard-working people who can be recruited easily. I only have three cities and a very small pool of recruits. I can't keep expanding my armed forces with newly arrived Bretonnians or with folk from Marienburg, as I don't trust their loyalties for the moment,\" I answered.\n\"Fine… I'll speak with father. We couldn't avoid ending up with a province full of Bretonnians that might rebel,\" said the prince.\n\"Relax, they are very docile. Give them some bread with legumes, a slice of meat, and a priest of Sigmar to remind them that Sigmar cares for them, and soon enough they'll start speaking Reikspiel and adopting the local customs. In my cities there is already a sizable group of Bretonnians who speak it fluently. Don't worry, in two generations they'll live like Reiklanders,\" I replied.\n\"If you say so…\" the prince answered, clearly doubtful.\n\"Well, I suppose you will handle the cleansing of the forests of Reikland… or will you wait for me to return from the south? If all goes well, I expect to be back by harvest time, or shortly after,\" I said, interested.\n\"Without your troops we lose a large part of the army's firepower. We should wait. Many nobles will not be pleased if we don't assign one of them to rule independently. That would reduce the Imperial army to only the most loyal provinces, because the decision would be extremely unpopular. But hey… that means you won't be at the victory celebration banquet,\" the prince said, staring at me intently.\n\"What for? Those events are a circus of bootlickers who only want to bleed me dry like leeches, until there's nothing left. They don't stop hounding you until they've squeezed out what they think they deserve,\" I replied.\n\"There is something very important we must address, something that bothers my father more and more each day,\" Karl said.\n\"Who have I offended now?\" I asked, scratching my head.\n\"No one—for the moment.... But given the way you act, it's only a matter of time before someone complains about you in court. It's your lack of an heir. We know you have a brother in Altdorf, studying at the university, but he's disinherited. Your mother took a vow of chastity, and as far as we know you have no direct relatives. Your death would place the Emperor in a tight spot, as he would inherit your lands. That would frighten the other electors: an Emperor with so many lands and troops directly under him would be seen as a threat,\" said the prince seriously.\n\"Quite the problem… don't you think? We'll resolve that when I return from the south,\" I said, beginning to stretch, feeling my muscles still stiff.\n\"This must be solved sooner rather than later. You shouldn't leave the Empire until you have an heir,\" replied the prince.\n\"You want me to tell the dawi that the Emperor won't let me go to help them?\" I said immediately.\n\"That would put us in serious trouble,\" Karl said with a frown.\n\"And you think it wouldn't for me? I already gave my word to the dawi. If I go back on it, they could write my name in the Dammaz Kron. If your father doesn't like it, too bad, but I must go south. I doubt he wants to lose the only vassal loyal enough to support him in his plans to centralize the Empire and solve the problem of provincial autonomy,\" I answered harshly.\nKarl shook his head. \"I just hope you don't die, because if you do we'll be in serious trouble. Your lands are already a challenge with so many different people living there,\" the prince said with concern.\n\"Don't worry so much. I'll return alive—I have to,\" I said with a smile.\nI began preparing everything, ensuring the army men returned to their lands and discharging the veterans who had spent months campaigning in Bretonnia. To many, I offered the chance to move into my domains, with gold as incentive.\nIn the end I brought with me four thousand men retired from several state regiments of the Empire, who would reinforce the garrisons of my cities and fortresses. I needed them: I had too much territory to defend and still lacked the hands to cover every post.\nSo, in Monfort I took care of moving everything necessary, leaving only the Reikland troops to garrison the ducal castles, while my men withdrew to Reinsfeld with the dawi to prepare the supplies for the journey south.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Everything stopped for this moment, with crowds gathering just to see the brave warriors who had won the war and put an end to two threats that had plagued Imperial trade in the region: the greenskins and the necromancer.\nThere should have been a sense of peace to benefit Reikland, all thanks to one man who seemed indifferent to the celebrations, as if being hailed a hero meant nothing to him. That was strange, for he was surrounded by nobles who would kill to be in his place, where the Emperor himself showered you with prestige and titles. But he rejected it, preferring instead to fight again—this time to aid the dawi. Some attributed it to Sigmarite zeal, to that branch which claims the only true prayer is obedience to Sigmar's will, that the truest worship is shedding the blood of His enemies. Yet I had observed him through the entire campaign, and I doubt he was ever a religious man. I never saw him pray, nor call upon the protection of the gods.\nAnd so, the military parade returned without the general or many of the troops who had actually won the war. Albrecht knew the Bretonnians as if he had lived among them. Every prediction he made about the campaign came true with uncanny precision. It was almost as though he had a hidden wizard of the Lore of Heavens by his side, for he foresaw Bretonnian moves with ease. Thanks to this, he managed to break the Gisoreux front within days, where others might have been bogged down for months.\nThis was the man the people now began to acclaim in the streets, even though he was not here to hear their cheers. And as I marched, greeting the crowds as befitted a prince of the Empire, I could not stop thinking that his indifference to glory made him all the more fearsome.\nThat made him difficult to predict, for I had no idea how to control such a man. Clearly he liked gold, but he only ever used it to generate more gold, almost like a merchant. I doubted that alone could be used to manipulate him, and that was the only basis we had for trying to exert even a shred of control. Beyond that, there was nothing—except that he was far more patient than he appeared, and when necessity called, he never hesitated to put himself in the front line.\nI also noticed that he was no politician, no matter how much he proclaimed himself one through war. He had no patience for diplomacy, nor the tact to seal agreements. He ruled over nobles by sheer fear alone, and now they breathed easier knowing he was not looming behind their shoulders like an executioner waiting for the smallest mistake.\nBut where he truly excelled was in charisma. I had never seen anyone so close to his men. He laughed with them, ate with them, sometimes even shared in labors others would consider beneath them, yet there he was, alongside his soldiers whenever he could. He helped them overcome their fears, spoke to them as if he had lived his entire life in camps. That was what struck me: though he was a little younger than I, he seemed a veteran hardened by decades of service. I know his father put him through brutal training to forge him into the warrior he is today, but even so, the way he moved and behaved was not common in a man his age.\nHis men adored him, and not only they: many troops of other nobles respected him as if he were their own lord. He was cruel with discipline, yes, but just; never punished without a clear fault, and when he did, his severity left a mark none dared to test again. The more I observed, the clearer it became that his men would follow him blindly. They never hesitated for an instant when he charged against a necromantic army; they followed him straight into the wolf's maw, as though they were marching to glory instead of death.\nAnd that is what worries me most. Not his strength, nor his cruelty, nor even his military cunning. It is the iron loyalty he inspires in others that makes him so dangerous to measure.\nMy presence in this campaign had not even been planned, but father insisted I take part. Albrecht had offered something that seemed too good to be true, and that meant it could be a trap. Father feared that this whole idea of a centralized Empire was just a ploy to leave him without political support, only to betray him later by backing another candidate for the throne and ruin him. That was why my mission was clear: to discover whether his intentions were sincere, and the true reach of his plans.\nAlthough, truth be told, I may have been somewhat distracted by what I discovered about him.\nThe celebration with the Grand Theogonist and his priests was solemn, though noticeably disappointed that Albrecht was not among us. Their conviction was restored upon hearing he had gone to aid the dawi, delighted that a noble would be so diligent in fulfilling Sigmar's designs. To them, Albrecht was already the perfect archetype of the Sigmarite ideal: iron obedience, discipline, personal sacrifice, and victory against the Empire's foes. The Theogonist did not hesitate to invite him to another ceremony upon his return from the southern mountains.\nAnd therein lay another of our concerns: that closeness with the Cult of Sigmar which bordered on the extreme. The Grand Theogonist clearly had him as a favorite, and should he ever contend for the crown, the clergy's support could easily swing to him. In that case, what would remain for Reikland? Would we be forced to yield to many of the Cult's demands, sacrificing Imperial authority to maintain balance?\nWhen the ceremony ended, in which the leaders of the army were blessed with solemn prayers, I returned to the palace. I knew that night I would have to speak with father, and finally decide what we would do about the plans proposed to us by the Elector Count of the Westerlands.\n\"Ah, my son, at last you've returned… well… your absence was shorter than I expected… but I've heard the campaign was almost too good to be true,\" father said in his private study, surrounded by advisors and spies who had surely already informed him of everything.\n\"Indeed, Father. I have returned from Bretonnia with good news: the war with Bretonnia has ended completely. We secured a peace treaty with King Feramand, who recognized his defeat at the hands of our new general. In addition, we destroyed the necromancer and wiped out the entire greenskin clan that plagued the Empire's passage into Bretonnia through the Axe Bite Pass,\" I replied, bowing my head.\n\"There is something that intrigues me… the necromancer. Were these separate battles, or what happened? The details aren't clear to me,\" Father asked, while one of his advisors whispered in his ear.\n\"In our cleansing mission, after waiting for a dawi host summoned by Elector Count Albrecht, we launched the attack. The battle unfolded as an overwhelming victory in our favor, but then the necromancer appeared. It was at that moment that Albrecht threw himself into the fight, and they barely managed to pull him out alive,\" I explained.\n\"Did he do something foolish… or anything that drew too much attention and almost cost him his life?\" Father asked, frowning.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\n\"No, I fear the necromancer was simply too powerful. His skeletal hosts bore armor consecrated to the Ruinous Powers, and many of their weapons were cursed. He must have been a very strong necromancer to control them. Albrecht charged straight at him, seizing the chance while a gigantic skeletal knight was locked in combat with the greenskin warlord, and managed to kill him. I don't know all the details, since few saw the fight—just a handful of his best men followed him in an attempt to bring down the necromancer,\" I replied honestly.\n\"Damn fool… playing with his life as if that doesn't cause me problems… well then, tell me, why isn't he here?\" Father asked.\n\"He decided to head south, to fight for the recovery of a dawi Karak. I don't know exactly when he departed, but he spoke of having secured aerial transports from the dwarfs to move his forces. I fear he must already be far beyond the Empire by now,\" I answered.\n\"What do you mean he is no longer in the Empire?… did you not warn him of what could happen if he dies?\" Father asked, eyes wide.\n\"I told him… but he replied that if we did not let him go, he would tell his dawi allies that the reason for his absence was because the Empire forbade him. That would put all the dwarf realms against us… something we cannot afford. To lose their alliances would be disastrous,\" I said firmly.\n\"Well… in that case… but damn it… why is he so erratic? Why could he not wait a couple of months to better coordinate our moves?… very well, son… tell me then: what did you learn of his character? Because it is hard to grasp what that man is truly like… and that irritates me,\" Father said after a heavy sigh.\n\"Honestly… little. Only confirmed what we already knew. He is a brilliant strategist: from the moment he arrived, he knew how the Bretonnians would move, what they would do, and how they would react. He staged a ruse and every Bretonnian fell for it, leaving him free to seize Gisoreux. Something makes me think the issue with the sewers was the cause, since many buildings collapsed in the city, breaking the wall and allowing him to enter, even though it was guarded by sorceresses and Grail Knights. His troops are blindly loyal to him, and he has great charisma with soldiers. Strange as it sounds, I saw it: all his men adore him. He pays them well, ensures they always have food and fresh water, and unlike nobles who flaunt their status with spiced delicacies, Albrecht eats the same rations as his men. I get the impression his father trained him far too well to be a soldier,\" I replied.\n\"That does not change much of what we know of him… I thought he might reveal more of himself during the campaign, but instead he only confirmed what we already suspected. Did he show interest in… I don't know, weapons, horses, women… anything?\" Father pressed, searching for some weakness to control him.\nI shook my head. \"No, nothing. Only that he thinks too much about everything. For example, it is common for him to forget to inform others about certain matters. Did you know he recovered three more dawi Karaks in the Grey Mountains and that he has excellent relations with the dwarfs?\"\n\"No… I did not know that,\" Father said gravely.\n\"How good are these relations?\" one of his advisors interjected.\n\"To the point of asking them to send an army… and they actually did so without hesitation, with their thane personally coming to support him. Some dwarfs even asked him to braid their beards… that level of closeness.\"\nMy father's advisors looked at one another in disbelief, while even he seemed unable to believe what I had just said.\n\"To braid their beards… even his thane's?\" Father asked, raising his brows.\n\"I don't know for certain, but they called him 'dawongi', and acted very close,\" I replied.\nAt once two advisors leaned in to whisper to Father, who remained thoughtful for several moments before speaking.\n\"Well… the dawi know how to recognize honor. I suppose that confirms it is possible he speaks sincerely when he says he wishes to aid us in this titanic work of centralizing the Empire. Though I would have liked to discover something more personal about him, and not rely only on these stories to make such an important decision. Be that as it may, we must resolve what to do with the Bretonnian lands,\" Father said, lifting a brow.\n\"Albrecht recommended we place some noble at the front who is easily replaceable, tied completely to Reikland… such as a general. Let him defend the frontiers, and have each general appointed be recognized as an elector. That way, when he retires, the office passes to another, but always under our control. In this manner, the vote would remain ours at all times,\" I explained, presenting Albrecht's suggestion.\n\"Yes… a good idea. Leave in his charge the fortresses of Montfort, Parravon, and Gisoreux, and distribute the rest of the lands among the Empire's lesser houses. Second or third sons, and let Imperial families move there,\" Father said, nodding.\n\"Speaking of that… Albrecht asks as his reward for the peasants of Parravon.\"\n\"Again?… Does he not have enough already? I heard he has already taken as spoils the entire population of two Bretonnian duchies,\" Father said.\n\"Yes… and still he wants more,\" I replied.\nFather shook his head and rubbed his face. \"This is not the time to deny him a reward, least of all now…\" he sighed heavily.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Marching all the way through the Border Princes' region was unthinkable. If we tried, sooner or later I would have had to establish a supply line, and that would have been tempting fate too much: the princes would see it as free gold, the greenskins as endless meat and sport, and the ogres wandering those lands would think exactly the same.\nThere was no other option but to depend on the dawi fleet and secure, through them, the permits to buy food in their markets to feed our army. Attempting to secure so much territory with my current forces would have been impossible.\nMy real recruitment capacity was already exhausted. I knew it well: I would have to wait a few years, with more migrations, to restore the flow of men. From the reliable population, the one I could trust without fearing a knife in the back, I had already recruited too many. The pressure was enormous: in reality, the recruitable population of my domains did not exceed one hundred and fifty thousand, and yet I already had nearly thirty thousand under my banners. A dangerous proportion.\nAs soon as I had the chance, I ordered the journey toward the dawi realms to begin. We loaded everything possible onto the flying barges, floating thanks to engines and huge hot-air tanks. We carried men, powder, weapons, gold… everything that could be loaded. But even so, it was obvious that this journey would require several trips: we could barely move around four thousand soldiers at a time, along with the necessary supplies to feed and clothe them on campaign.\nSo the whole journey was spent observing the high mountains that dominated the region, their peaks sharp and capped with eternal snow. On more than one we saw signs of greenskin clans, small fortified camps clinging to the high crags. We also spotted griffons soaring majestically on the air currents; from time to time, my own griffon dared to fly alongside the fleet, though only in short stretches to test the strength of its wings. It always kept to the margin, as if it knew it was still regaining its vigor.\nThe journey was relatively short, although in truth we had covered a vast distance. The aerial route allowed us to take the most direct path, avoiding dangerous passes and the endless foot marches that would have consumed weeks. The only real problem was the temperature: as we crossed the highest peaks, the cold was intense, so much so that we were forced to wear winter clothing even in the middle of summer. The icy wind pierced to the bone, keeping many of my men hunched in silence for hours.\nFinally, after five long days flying over mountain ranges, watching cities reduced to mere ants from our vantage point in the skies, and reflecting on what awaited us on arrival, we at last saw the dawi mountains, our destination.\nThe air fleet began its descent toward what appeared to be a great aerodrome carved into the rock, designed to receive these transport ships. There, squads of dwarfs awaited us, and with impeccable efficiency they began unloading the cargo while taking strict count of the men. They were watchful that no one had tried the bright idea of jumping during the journey, something they would no doubt have taken as an offense.\nI gathered my four thousand men and organized them as quickly as possible, while at the same time requesting an audience with the High King of the Karak. I knew perfectly well that, for the dawi, it would be a grave offense for a human to arrive unannounced and attempt to settle grievances on his own. Such an act would be the same as saying the clan had no strength to deliver justice for itself, and that was a direct insult to their honor. I had to present myself carefully: my intention was to help, not to usurp anyone's duty, and diplomacy was essential for them to understand the difference.\nThe problem, of course, was that the dawi were in no hurry to receive us. They had the courtesy to leave us waiting, forcing me to pay for lodging in dwarf taverns that mostly refused to host humans. The few establishments that accepted us did not have enough capacity to house so many men. In the end, I was forced to set up camp outside Karaz-a-Karak, with everything that entailed: discomfort, the resentment of some of my officers… and the constant risk of greenskins prowling the region.\nIt took almost a week before I secured an audience with the High King of Karaz-a-Karak, Thorgrim Grudgebearer, who was not very aware of what was happening for obvious reasons, and considering that I had another four thousand men on their way when the air fleet returned, in the coming days I would have around eight thousand men waiting as time passed.\nThus, the throngs of dawi clad in runic armor let me through without much trouble, aside from a few sidelong glances at my armor, and to my surprise they did not ask many questions about how I had acquired it, for being human-sized they clearly understood it was a gift given to me by the dawi people. So sometimes, it was simply a friendly question about where I had obtained my runic artifacts.\nAfter waiting a couple of hours, a group of dawi emerged from a great hall and one of the guards, heavily warded in defensive runes, poked his head out.\n\"Umgi… the High King has a moment for you. Don't waste his time,\" said the guard, opening the door and letting me in.\nUpon entering I found a huge table where a dozen dawi were gathered around one who had a book in his hands and was writing something in red ink. I quickly bowed my head in reverence.\nWhen I entered, all the dawi rose to their feet, interrupting what they were doing for a moment as they observed what was happening. \"Umgi, your name,\" said one of the dwarfs holding a book, ready to search for information.\n\"Albrecht von Reinsfeld, honorable dawi,\" I replied to the dwarf, who quickly began to search his book and then started speaking to his lord, who looked at me with interest.\n\"Are you the umgi who aided in the recovery of Karak Kronaz?\" asked the High King, narrowing his eyes at me and lowering his book.\n\"I am, High King. I was the one who helped reclaim the ancient fortress from the greenskin threat,\" I replied, raising my head.\nThorgrim nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on me like the edge of an axe against stone. \"Then listen well, Albrecht von Reinsfeld. In this book there are no grudges written against your name. No dawi forgets one who rises beside him against the greenskins. For that reason, you are welcome in Karaz-a-Karak, and your steps will find a seat in these halls.\"\nHe paused, the silence weighing as heavily as his words. \"But understand this, umgi: every word spoken before me may be remembered within the pages of the Dammaz Kron. Do not misinterpret my hospitality. Speak without riddles… what reason brings you before the High King of the dawi?\"\n\"I am grateful for your courtesy, High King. The reason I stand here is simple: I promised my friend Duran Snorrison, thane of a clan near my lands, that I would support the dawi cause in the recovery of the karaks lost to the greenskins, drawing on the tactical experience of many of my men in this kind of war,\" I answered honestly.\nThe dawi began speaking among themselves, though from time to time their words turned toward me.\n\"How many umgi march with you, son of the Empire of Sigmar?\" asked the High King in a deep voice.\n\"For now, four thousand, High King. But soon more should arrive, reaching fifteen thousand if all goes well. They are on their way by air, thanks to the contacts of my friend Duran,\" I replied.\n\"Fifteen thousand umgi…\" Thorgrim nodded slowly. \"It will be welcome aid. Any who raise the axe against the greenskins deserves a place at the side of the dawi. But speak plainly, umgi… you need more than that.\"\n\"I request your authorization to act in the name of the dawi nobles. I would never think to intervene without the consent of those who carry grudges against the greenskins, nor to insult their honor. That is why I ask your blessing, High King, so that when my men join them, they do so with your sanction and that of the ancestors, fighting for the recovery of the karaks in the name of the dawi people,\" I said with a friendly tone.\nThorgrim fixed his gaze on me. \"As I have said, all aid will be accepted. No honorable dawi will refuse the arm of an ally who has already proven his worth in battle. Your help will be received, umgi, and your name remembered among those who rose against ruin.\"\n\"I am glad to hear it. Only one more thing I must ask, High King: authorization to purchase supplies in the dawi markets. Be it through a guild patent, your word, or whatever means you deem proper. It is impossible to maintain a stable supply line from the Empire to march further south,\" I explained.\nThorgrim closed the Dammaz Kron firmly, his voice resounding deep in the hall. \"Granted. All umgi of the house of Reinsfeld shall have my permission to trade in Karaz-a-Karak, so long as your intentions remain as you have declared: to aid in the recovery of the karaks of those clans who lost their ancestral homes. But remember this, umgi: if you fail your word… your name will be written in this book, and no oath will ever erase that debt.\"\n\"I will keep that in mind, High King. With your leave, all that I desired from this meeting is now fulfilled. I will ensure that I march once my men are gathered,\" I said calmly.\nBefore I could withdraw, the voice of the High King thundered through the hall, heavy as a hammer upon the anvil: \"Do you not ask for anything in return for your aid, umgi?\"\nI turned and met his gaze firmly. \"I would never ask for anything in return for fulfilling my duty, High King. The Cult of Sigmar teaches us to aid our dawi allies, and that is what I will do. To demand reward for duty would be dishonorable… unworthy of a son of the Empire.\"\nThe hall fell silent. The dwarf lords stared without blinking. Thorgrim remained still for a moment, then slowly began to nod. A faint smile, barely perceptible beneath his beard, crossed his hardened face.\n\"Well spoken, umgi,\" said the High King solemnly. \"Words matter. But deeds weigh more. I will remember what you have said today. And if you keep it, your name will be remembered in Karaz-a-Karak with respect. If you fail…\" —he laid his hand upon the open Dammaz Kron before him— \"…it will be written here.\"\n\"Thank you, High King. Now, with your leave, I withdraw,\" I said with a faint smile, stepping out of the hall after having passed the small trap the Grudgebearer had set to measure my intentions.\nI knew well that if I had asked for anything at that moment, my name would have been inscribed in the Dammaz Kron at once. The dawi never forgive one who bargains with their honor. With them, payment is claimed after aid, when their own sense of debt and honor compels them to repay. Not before.\nI quickly gathered my men with the High King's written permit in hand. From that moment, no dawi refused us service or trade: the news that we marched south to aid in the recovery of the karaks spread swiftly, faster than I had expected.\nWe purchased provisions in the dwarven markets to spare our own reserves while awaiting the arrival of the rest of our troops. And in that time, I held talks with members of minor clans seeking our support in reclaiming small fallen karaks. Some even offered a share of their hall's riches as incentive, hoping I might direct my forces toward their lost homes. They were small fortresses, easy targets that could yield quick victories… and prestige that would no doubt prove useful in the future.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The orcs fell in droves, collapsing under the storm of lead, and the few stragglers who remained tried to flee back into the mountains. The cavalry wheeled sharply and began firing into them, forcing them to retreat into the dawi karak we had located.\nIt did not take long to confirm that the dwarven fortresses were under constant pressure. At every mountain pass there were bands of greenskins hunting caravans or preying on livestock. In recent days we had even found abandoned karaks—the very ones the dawi had asked me to reclaim. These days, most dwarfs lived packed tightly within Karaz-a-Karak under the High King. There, they were relatively safe, but at the price of terrible overcrowding. Resources were spent on defending the walls rather than holding the conquered halls. To reclaim a karak was possible, but to keep it running was another matter entirely.\nSince Karaz-a-Karak was currently the first line of battle against the greenskins, nearly all the dawi lived within a northern tunnel complex. That was where the majority of their population resided, working vast underground farms and mines where mushroom caverns continued to expand. Most refugees ended up in that labor unless they found a trade in smithies or alchemical workshops, which were operating at full capacity to continue the war against the greenskins.\nMany thanes from the southern mountains had promised me rewards from their halls and vaults—if anything remained after orcish pillaging—and even shares of what was found in their ancestors' tombs, in exchange for helping them recover these fortresses. Thus I had spent my recent days: preparing my men, purchasing dwarven weaponry with the gold I had brought, and stockpiling supplies. I had secured a hundred dawi blunderbusses and improvised paper cartridge ammunition filled with lead shot, perfect for fighting in narrow tunnels.\nThe karak we were about to cleanse had fallen not long ago, yet its loss had already broken a vital trade route to human settlements. That was why I refused to launch a blind offensive: instead we lured the orcs out, chasing after my cavalry, and then hunted them down with concentrated fire. This eased the pressure before we entered.\n\"All greenskins dead?\" I asked from the hilltop.\n\"Yes, sir. To the last,\" replied a soldier as he drove his bayonet into an orc corpse.\n\"Good. Gather them and burn them quickly,\" I ordered, walking toward the entrance of the karak with my escort.\nAs we went inside, I confirmed with my senses what I already suspected: few metallic presences. Most of the greenskins had chased the cavalry, only to fall into the trap.\nWe advanced with dwarven shotguns ready and rune-armored plates gleaming under the dim tunnel light. The corridors were filled with the usual filth: bones, rotting remains, heaps of shattered iron, and dwarven statues smashed with deliberate malice.\nAn explosion echoed to my right.\n\"Two down!\" one of my men shouted from the entrance to a chamber.\nThen we heard footsteps. With my magic I felt their numbers approaching, and the guttural howls that always came before a charge rang out. The orcs burst in violently, but they ran straight into a blunderbuss muzzle. The shot belched a cloud of lead that tore them apart in seconds.\nPiles of greenskins dropped with only two or three blasts.\n\"Now this is quality…\" one of my men muttered, raising his dwarven weapon still smoking after blowing apart an orc in a single shot.\nEntering each chamber and carefully checking every space, we discovered that this karak had once been a dwarven farm, with wide clear areas of fertile soil and a water transport system. But now, the only things growing were mushrooms.\nIt did not take long to declare it secure and dispatch a rider to the dawi thane who had promised me reward for its recovery.\nAs we prepared to push further south through the tunnels to see what else we might find, the thane of this karak arrived with a large band of dawi carrying supplies. At once he led me to his treasuries, though the first was already stripped bare by the greenskins. We checked another—also empty—and I saw the dwarf grow increasingly anxious. Only upon opening the third, brimming with gold and silver, did he breathe a sigh of relief.\n\"As I promised, umgi, a third of all you find in my treasuries is now yours,\" said the dawi thane, showing me the amassed wealth.\n\"Thank you. This will serve to finance my warriors' food… You know the region better than I do—do you know what lies to the south, beyond the great tunnel?\" I asked about our next step.\n\"The next karak is not mine, umgi. But I've heard it was devoted to livestock—meat, milk, hides—and that it supported a thriving textile industry, trading clothing,\" replied the dawi.\n\"Good. For now, I recommend you secure this karak while I continue my way. Divide the share of gold that is mine; I must keep pressing on through the tunnels before another greenskin attack threatens you again,\" I said, turning away.\n\"Thank you, umgi. May my ancestors bless your struggle,\" answered the dwarf.\nWe quickly resumed our push into the tunnels, using my magic and exploiting the greenskin mindset of throwing themselves into battle as quickly as possible. The strategy worked well: I was reclaiming a minor karak every two or three days, after first thinning their numbers by drawing them into killing grounds where our cannons could slaughter them.\nThe tunnels were laid out in a strikingly orderly fashion: the southern mountain resembled a grid, with each karak linked to four others by north, south, east, and west tunnels. To advance, we had to cleanse those routes before moving to the next.\nAnother wave of reinforcements eventually arrived. Fortunately, while the greenskins were numerous, they were not endless, which made it feasible to keep reclaiming karaks without losing control.\nWe were gathering significant amounts of dawi gold, and—more importantly—runic weapons. As soon as the first karaks were secured by my forces, news spread like wildfire among the clans. Many workers, previously crammed into the northern holds, rushed down, eager to return to their old homes. To my dismay, this forced me to leave garrisons in tunnels and rotate men constantly so they would not be exposed underground for too long.\nEven so, every karak meant treasure, and in some cases, ancestral runic weaponry. Thanes, seeing their vaults emptied, felt guilty for luring me with broken promises and instead offered runic weapons as compensation. The dawi armors, unsuited for human physiology, I declined. But runic swords, axes, and hammers were gladly added to my men's arsenal.\nCautiously, after nearly three weeks of successful tunnel fighting and multiple karaks reclaimed, I decided to surface and rest for a week. I did not want to overstrain my men with endless underground living. I warned the dawi that the advance would pause, even if more karaks lay ahead ready for liberation.\nBut upon emerging from the complex, I found an enormous dwarven camp raised at the entrance. Several clans had gathered, hoping to be the next fortunate ones to see their homes reclaimed. Far from being disheartened at our pause, they welcomed us with open arms, inviting me to their tables and offering rewards for my services. An umgi who had cleansed ten karaks in such a short span was someone they placed many hopes in. Thanes of noble lineage began to negotiate with me, offering maps leading to deeper karaks and promises of what they would pay if I agreed to help them.\nUntil the last reinforcements arrived, I devoted myself to stockpiling supplies and arming my troops. With the High King's permits, I could purchase runic arms without too many questions, so I took advantage to acquire a good number of swords and to commission custom-fitted armor for my front line.\nAfter a week of rest, we descended into the tunnels once more. Sometimes we had to cleanse karaks already cleared, as new greenskin hordes slipped in through secondary passages. The dawi, for their part, pressed on with their relentless work—burning remains and using their steam-machines to purge every crack.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nMy progress was slow but methodical, and that was enough. Casualties were minimal—barely a few wounded—since my front line consisted of my finest soldiers, all clad in runic armor. For now, the campaign was a resounding success: if I kept this pace, I would amass abundant gold and a formidable arsenal of runic weapons with which, later, I could return to the Empire and finally cleanse the beastmen-plagued forests once and for all.\nThe main problem was that everything relied on my own forces. The High King had dispatched only a few hundred of his warriors to cover the areas we cleansed, ensuring a surprise greenskin attack would not undo our reconquest. The true dilemma would come once I departed: the dwarfs' problem would remain. Reclaiming a karak was one thing—restoring its full function was another, requiring resources, time, and far more warriors than the clans currently possessed.\nThe more karaks we liberated, the wider the tunnel labyrinth grew. The mountain's grid pattern held, multiplying the fronts to be defended with only a handful of guardians.\nThat was why I began investing the gold gained into fostering the local dawi economy, raising fortifications at the furthest tunnels I now considered our line of advance. There I installed strongpoints, reinforced with dwarven cannons I myself purchased from the spoils. Each position had to be able to hold on its own, even if no human troops were near to support it.\nAt the same time, I started forging bonds between clans, forcing them into joint defense. I established shared protection zones where each clan pledged to send warriors, supplies, and gold to maintain the balance. It was a radical change from the traditional dwarven mindset, where they preferred to see a neighbor fall rather than risk weakening their own defenses waiting for the High King's aid. But with gold on the table—and the condition that any future karaks liberated must agree to this arrangement or I would move on elsewhere—more than one thane accepted the pact willingly.\nThus, little by little, I was creating spaces where my presence was no longer needed each day, allowing me to advance further without fear of losing what had already been reclaimed.\nWhat was clear, however, was that sooner or later Karaz-a-Karak would have to transform that enormous mass of farmers and artisans crammed in its caverns into warriors capable of defending their frontiers. Otherwise, no matter how many tunnels we cleansed, the greenskin threat would return again and again.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

They hammered with axes, clubs, even with their own skulls like rabid beasts, desperate to force their way through.\nThe gunfire continued for endless minutes until, at last, we brought up the organ gun. The weapon roared, spitting fire and shot into the packed orcish horde, tearing them apart at once. Little by little, the green tide faltered, then broke; the survivors fled back toward the karak further along that same route.\n\"Uff… that was close,\" I said, exhaling heavily. \"They almost caught us with our trousers down. But now, with the cannon properly set, this pass should be easy to hold.\"\nThe dawi militiamen only nodded, their eyes fixed on the tunnel darkness into which the greenskins had retreated.\nMost of these militiamen were part of my recent idea for a joint defense force between clans. Young dawi, for the most part—many of them had never mastered a craft, their lives spent in subterranean farms. But with muskets, powder, and a few cannons, I had turned them into a force able to hold against greenskins, provided they had steady supplies. And therein lay the heart of the plan: the system.\nEntire karaks had been converted into storehouses, stockpiling food, weapons, and armor for the common defense. Other clans pooled gold to negotiate for provisions in the name of all. That way, any tunnel wall had nearby resources to resist, without depending on the High King's fickle orders.\nMy idea of aiding in the retaking of Karak Eight Peaks was still a distant dream—it would require an immense, prolonged march. Sooner or later, every Border Prince, every greenskin horde, even ogres, would see our supply lines as free meat and gold.\nThe young dawi were learning the art of war. That, I told myself, would be my greatest gift to their people: the ability to control their domains once more without needing the High King to send entire armies in one direction.\nThat was the greatest weakness of the current system: if the High King ordered a march north, every clan sent warriors there, leaving the southern and western fronts exposed. With these joint militias, each clan could hold its own wall, while their neighbors knew they would not be left unprotected.\nIn the past weeks, the results had already shown. Several karaks to the west had been retaken, because the local thanes offered greater resources to the joint defense in exchange for aid. In barely seven weeks, more than forty thousand dawi had abandoned the overcrowded holds near Karaz-a-Karak to return to the southern fortresses. This had greatly eased the suffocating crowding in the High King's central strongholds.\nAs the tunnels were cleared, the mines reopened, farms repaired, and dwarven industry stirred once more: forges blazing again, alchemical workshops working at full tilt, hammers ringing on anvils. For the first time in a long while, the production of weapons and armor was growing in the region.\nThus, while I focused on liberating the western mountains, the dawi began to recover. With mineral flows restored thanks to the cleared tunnels, their local industry expanded further. Even so, they still needed to import wood and other materials from the southern human principalities—indispensable for weapons\nFor my part, I had also taken up the work of trainer for the dawi. Though their strength dwarfed human standards, many had never wielded more than the hammer of their forge. Strange, to me—accustomed as I was to dwarves hardened by centuries of battle—but here I found youths whose beards had barely grown, sent by their clans as expendables for training.\nTo these lads I taught the use of firearms, how to form and hold a line under pressure, and, in dire need, how to brace a hedge of pikes. For while a dawi, with his natural strength, could drive a spear clean through an orc in one thrust, the orc could just as easily return the favor with equal brutality. The only way to balance the scales was to keep them at a distance, to let the greenskins impale themselves again and again upon the iron discipline of a closed formation.\n\"With this one, twenty-two karaks have been liberated since the campaign began, reaching the limits of the mountain. That zone no longer needs a fortress facing west, but rather to the south,\" I said, reviewing the maps the dawi had given me, studying our next move.\n\"Umgi, my clan's karak lies not far from here. It housed many forges that might still be operable, and they would be invaluable to sustain the defenses,\" said a dawi thane, pointing to a karak three squares south and one east of our position.\n\"For that karak to be secure, we'd need to clear at least twelve fortresses beforehand. That's too heavy an investment. I'd rather not sit with only two safe tunnels from east to west. Better to retake these here,\" I replied, marking the third square southward. \"That way we secure more ground in case one defense should fail.\"\n\"My clan lies further south still,\" another thane interjected, indicating a karak two squares below my plan. \"If we reclaim my fortress, I will pledge three thousand of my young to the communal defenses… but someone must provide the arms.\"\n\"My clan can provide the firearms and black powder necessary, but I require my karak to be reclaimed as soon as possible,\" said another, pointing to a karak in the east.\n\"And do you have any problem with your fortress being considered part of the defensive line?\" I asked with interest.\n\"No. What matters to me is verifying that the ancestors of my clan have not suffered any grievance in their eternal rest,\" the dawi replied with a severe tone.\n\"Good. That will be next week's plan,\" I concluded as I folded the maps.\n\"Next week?\" several thanes asked at once.\n\"Yes. My men need to leave the mountains before they start seeing things that aren't there. We'll take a few days' rest and then return to the fight. In case of emergency, notify me or my men and we'll send reinforcements. But understand this: the body of an umgi is not accustomed to underground life,\" I replied, staring at them firmly.\nI saw several dawi frown and purse their lips, but in the end they nodded.\n\"Reinforce the walls, arm anyone who can carry a musket, and wait patiently. I'll try to return with more resources. And if I see that the dawi militias can truly help us, we might even attempt something bolder: reclaiming two karaks at the same time,\" I added before leaving the newly recovered fortress.\nWith my men, we abandoned the defensive positions and emerged from the mountains for a well-earned week of rest, after fighting without pause in the dawi tunnels.\nThe camp outside Karaz-a-Karak had not stopped growing. Many thanes still refused to cooperate with the common plan: they only wanted their own karaks reclaimed, continuing their clan rivalries at the expense of unity. So I limited myself to helping those who were willing to cooperate.\nDuring the week of rest, I noticed how trade became safer. Several human merchants from the principalities had arrived with wagons loaded with freshly cut logs or great quantities of grain, all eagerly bought by the dawi. Improvised workshops were producing parts for firearms, later sold to the clans that already had repaired forges to complete the assembly.\nWhile enjoying my dose of vitamin D, I noticed a secluded area of the camp. There, a dawi engineer was working—but strangely, no one else was around him.\nHe was building a firearm, and doing so much faster than I was used to seeing from a dawi.\nAs I approached to see what kind of weapon he was making, he suddenly turned, pointing the barrel straight at my face. My immediate reaction was to kick, knocking the weapon upward just as it discharged, the shot blasting barely inches from my head.\n\"Are you insane!? Who in the hell points a loaded weapon at another man's face?\" I shouted angrily.\n\"And who in the hell kicks another's weapon while he's holding it?\" the dawi retorted.\n\"Someone who doesn't enjoy the taste of lead in his mouth, maybe,\" I kept shouting.\n\"My creation is perfectly safe, watch.\" He turned toward a nearby tree and pulled the trigger. But the weapon didn't fire.\n\"So safe it doesn't even shoot, dawi,\" I said, arms crossed.\n\"Give me a moment…\" he muttered, tinkering with the mechanism.\n\"Maybe the spark isn't reaching the black powder,\" I suggested while watching.\n\"Yes… that must be it. Exactly that… if I adjust here and shift this…\" he said while making changes. Then he aimed at the tree again, firing a lead projectile that tore it apart. \"See? Completely safe, without the need for centuries of testing.\"\n\"What do you mean, 'without centuries of testing'? That goes against dawi tradition,\" I said, raising an eyebrow.\n\"And what does a manling know of our traditions?\" the engineer replied.\n\"Enough, dawi… enough to know we could be very good friends.\" I smiled at him.\n\"In what way?\" asked the dawi, puzzled.\n\"May I?\" I said, pointing at the weapon.\nHe handed it to me. It was good work, though lacking the usual dwarven sturdiness to the touch. It felt hastily assembled—something unusual for his kind. It had a sealed system to guide the spark into the barrel, and two triggers: one for the upper barrel, another for the lower. The engineer had created a shotgun, clearly superior to the traditional blunderbuss.\n\"Yes… I think we can do good business,\" I said, handing it back.\n\"And what can you offer me, manling?\" the dawi asked, still wary.\n\"Oh, come now, dawi… I'm the creator of smokeless powder.\" I pulled out a pouch and tossed it to him. \"Your kin are interested in my invention, but they limit themselves to centuries of testing before recommending it.\"\nThe dawi stared in surprise for a few seconds before examining the pouch.\n\"I've seen this before… I tried to recreate it for weeks because of its power, but I failed. Besides, it's too expensive, with too few orders to fund my projects. But yes… I saw its strength, and especially that it leaves no residue.\" His tone had grown more respectful.\n\"I'm glad you recognize it. But I want to propose something,\" I said with a broad smile.\n\"I'm listening, umgi,\" the dawi replied.\n\"I've designed a firing system that doesn't require a spark, only a strike to trigger it. I need a dawi engineer, though I know all my designs would be rejected as too innovative. But you… you could help me.\"\n\"I need to see it with my own eyes first,\" he answered.\n\"Good. Give me a few minutes.\"\nI ran to my camp, grabbed a piece of bronze, and with my magic, shaped it into a casing. I filled it with smokeless powder, placed a bullet at the top, and crafted a mercury fulminate primer at the base. Once the ammunition was ready, I brought it back to the dawi.\nHe examined it closely, then placed it on the anvil and struck it with a hammer. The primer detonated, firing the bullet.\nHis face transformed in astonishment, mouth open, stunned.\n\"What are your conditions, umgi?\" the engineer finally asked.\n\"Let's make a deal. I'll give you all the funding you need, all the smokeless powder you require. But in return, I want you to manufacture weapons using this system. Similar to your shotgun. We'll be clearing tunnels for months, and I need a reliable arsenal. That's my condition. I'll provide you with everything necessary to produce them,\" I said with a smile.\nThe dawi stood in thought, tapping his foot nervously against the ground.\n\"I'll need guild authorization… but yes… a contract is impossible, the guild wouldn't accept it. Still, as a guild representative, I could make it feasible,\" he admitted.\n\"Good. I'll ask the High King to speak with the Engineers' Guild of Karaz-a-Karak so I can sponsor a dawi genius like you.\" I extended my hand.\nThe dawi clasped it firmly.\n\"Albrecht von Reinsfeld,\" I said, handing over all the smokeless powder I had on hand.\n\"Grimm Burloksson,\" the dawi replied, immediately beginning to experiment with the powder.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The whole point is that it should fire the same type of cartridge. If you split them in two, you'll cause a mistake in battle,\" our lord shouted, starting yet another of those arguments that almost always flared up when he spoke with that stubborn dwarf.\n\"Who are you calling wazzok, manling? It's not my fault your kind panics so quickly. The weapon must have two separate barrels: one for grobi and another for urk. Because if we use the barrel you want, it won't kill the urk,\" the dwarf retorted, his voice rough and hard as stone, defending his ideas as was his custom.\n\"Yes it will! We've already tested the caliber and the smokeless powder—it does pierce the urk. I just need this to fire the ammunition I asked for,\" our lord insisted, raising his voice further, his patience almost spent.\nAt that moment one of my comrades, Konrad, came walking quickly, carrying two enormous mugs of beer in his hands. He dropped down beside me with a sigh and handed me one.\n\"The usual?\" he asked, taking a long gulp, closing his eyes as if it revived him. \"Buah… kicks like a horse.\"\n\"Let's see,\" I said, trying a sip. My throat burned and I smiled. \"Ujuju… kicking like a horse is nothing compared to this.\" Dwarf beer was thick, strong, almost like drinking fire.\n\"So, why are they fighting now? Yesterday it was about the size of the barrel—what's today's excuse?\" Konrad asked, scratching his patchy beard.\n\"About the type of ammunition the weapon should use,\" I answered, taking another small sip of that cursed drink. \"Damn… the dwarfs really do know how to make good beer.\"\n\"Well, better that way. Less time in those dwarf tunnels, because I really don't like always being the first line,\" Konrad muttered, half weary.\n\"We're lucky to have runic armor. The greenskins' weapons barely scratch before we blow their chests apart with a single shot,\" I replied with a shrug.\n\"Yeah, but being so far from home is the problem… Especially when I asked the paymaster how much my share of the spoils would be when it's divided among us,\" Konrad said, lowering his voice as if afraid an officer might overhear.\n\"Oh yeah? And how much is it then? Because I almost never ask—after all, fortune is decided on the battlefield, not in the purse,\" I answered with genuine interest.\n\"With the current spoils, each of us gets eighty gold crowns. That's nearly two years' salary. And that's without even looting—everything comes from what the dwarfs paid to have their fortresses liberated. I just want this over soon, to go home and see if I can retire,\" Konrad said, a spark of hope in his eyes.\n\"Why though? Don't you like serving? We're the personal guard of the Elector Count of the Westerland. Only serving in the Reiksguard would carry more honor and prestige,\" I answered, surprised.\n\"I know… and the pay is good, I earn double the others. But I have five children, and I want to watch them grow. Being the count's vanguard makes me nervous… I don't want to be the next to fall,\" he answered, staring into his mug as if his future lay inside it.\n\"It's something we accepted when we swore to Sigmar's cause,\" I said solemnly.\n\"I know, but right now all I want is to go home, see my children, buy my wife fine clothes and toys for the little ones. We've been away too long,\" he said at last, smiling wearily.\nAnd he was right. Serving alongside the dawi was exhausting. The dwarfs here were different from those in our lands: harder, more resentful, quick to take offense over anything. If you looked at them the wrong way, they grew angry; if you didn't look, the same; if you greeted them too cheerfully, they were offended; if you didn't greet them, worse. There was always a reason to grumble.\nAnd we were surrounded by them. Everywhere in camp there were dwarfs. When our lord wasn't arguing with that engineer about cannons and calibers, he was negotiating with others about treaties, spoils, and the gold they would pay to reclaim their Karaks.\nIt had been like that ever since we left the mountains: banquets, feasts, marriages almost daily. The dwarfs celebrated alongside our lord Albrecht, who seemed more a prince of their folk than a noble of the Empire. He was weaving a network of dwarf alliances: enemy clans reconciled, sealed peace through marriage, signed public pacts.\nI saw with my own eyes how, in our camp, dwarf weddings were celebrated: elders with braided beards raising mugs, brides with silver crowns, clans swearing that when a daughter was born of the union, she would wed the first son of another clan. All to bind them into that web of alliances our lord was building.\nI didn't know why our lord was so invested in dwarf politics. He was relentless in insisting they should stand on their own feet, but at the same time he had to juggle endlessly to make them set aside their ancient rivalries and cooperate.\nAnd so it went on, with arguments with the engineer flaring up again and the dwarf banquets continuing as usual. At each one, more clans joined the defensive alliance the count was forging, until over a hundred dwarf lords were committed to defend one another as if an attack on one was an attack on all.\nBut sooner or later came the hard part: tightening armor straps and returning to the tunnels in search of battle.\nAs I fastened my straps, the count arrived with a new weapon in his hands. \"Look, Kaspar, I need you to use this piece now and test these munitions. We must prove their effectiveness in combat, and I can only entrust it to my best men. So take it and use it,\" he said, handing me a double-barreled firearm.\nI took it, heavier than the dwarf blunderbuss I had been using before. The metal still smelled of the forge and the balance felt rough, but solid.\n\"Now, the system is simple. Release the safety, push the barrels forward, here are the openings, place two charges like this… then close it and done. Pull either of the two triggers—never both at once. The weapon should be enough to tear the greenskins to pieces, and it's easy to reload. See?\" explained Count Albrecht calmly as he showed me.\nHe handed me a belt loaded with cartridges.\n\"Any risk I should keep in mind, my lord?\" I asked with a half-smile.\n\"It shouldn't blow up in your face, but don't trust it too much. Keep your wits about you and don't take unnecessary risks,\" he replied while handing out other weapons to the nearest veterans. Behind him, the dwarf engineer followed, scribbling notes as always, grumbling at every detail.\nWith my armor in place and the new weapon loaded, we pushed into another underground fortress. The mission was the same: reclaim the lost halls and corridors. This time several thousand dwarfs marched with us, burdened with weapons, barrels of powder, and supplies.\nFor hours we advanced, passing through fortresses already retaken, where the dwarfs were rebuilding workshops and repairing their homes, bringing life back to the mountains. At every stop they handed us supplies for the stores, and in three more fortresses to the south more men and provisions joined us, until we reached the defensive frontier. There, at the stone gates, we saw what was left of a previous incursion: dozens of orc corpses torn apart by cannons and muskets.\nWe pressed on toward the next occupied fortress. From the tunnels came the echo of greenskin screams bouncing off the stone, but every step of our armored boots smothered them bit by bit.\nThe battlefield opened into a wide chamber beneath the mountain, large enough to deploy in order. The cannons were placed in the rear, the pikemen lowered their lances, and in front of them the musketeers formed up, steady, waiting for the first wave.\nA band of scouts went ahead to provoke the enemy. The echoes of their shots faded in the passages, and it wasn't long before we saw them running back, pursued by dozens of orcs roaring from the depths.\nThe count gave the order. The muskets thundered as one. The first rank fired and knelt, the second fired over them, and so the sequence continued. Hundreds of orcs and goblins fell, the tunnel thick with the stench of powder. There were fewer than expected, so the cannons barely fired. We pushed forward, stepping over the bodies.\nThen came the worst part: clearing the fortress of stragglers. Those were always the most dangerous, for we had to hunt them room by room, fighting in the dark like beasts cornered.\nWith the new weapons at the front—only five in the whole company—we led the groups. My heart beat fast, the damp air clung to us, and every shadow seemed to move as we advanced.\nI heard a creak to my right, from a side chamber. I glanced at a comrade carrying a dwarf blunderbuss; he nodded silently. I crept forward, peering in bit by bit.\nInside, a hulking brute awaited me. A massive orc, with yellowed tusks and burning eyes. His chest rose and fell like a bellows, and the echo of his growls filled the room. He stared at me with red eyes and opened his mouth.\n\"WAAAAAAAAAGH!!!\"\nThe roar rattled my bones. I pressed the stock of the weapon against my shoulder, sweat running beneath my helmet, and braced myself to fire.\nI pulled the trigger. The kick caught me off guard; I nearly lost it, the barrel jolted in my hands before I wrestled it back under control. I searched for the greenskin… but all I saw was his skull blown apart, splattered against the stone wall.\n\"By holy Sigmar… this weapon is a marvel,\" I said without meaning to, staring at how the orc's head was practically gone in a single shot.\nI stepped back out and the others peered inside, astonished at the remains. I flicked the safety off as I had been taught, removed the spent cartridge, and slid in another. The mechanism locked with a metallic snap, unfamiliar but satisfying.\nFar off, more shots echoed through the galleries. We continued room by room, clearing each chamber of the fortress.\nA single cartridge was enough to destroy a greenskin's head or chest, and I made full use of it. I kicked one door wide and stormed inside. Two orcs were within, devouring a fresh corpse. They looked up at me, snarling, blood smeared across their mouths.\nI gave them no time.\nI squeezed the trigger and one exploded through the chest, flung against the wall. The second lunged at me with a roar, but I fired the other barrel: its arm and half its torso disintegrated into meat and bone, dropping like an empty sack at my feet.\nWe cleansed each level of the fortress, corridor after corridor, chamber after chamber. For nearly two hours we fought through the stragglers who refused to die. The echoes of gunfire and death cries mingled with the thick reek of powder and blood.\nAt last, when all was silent, the count gave the order: the fortress was clean. The dwarfs poured in behind us with steam machines, hammers, and supplies. They immediately began repairing walls, reinforcing gates, and building new defenses to the south and east.\nWe, exhausted and spattered with greenskin remains, accompanied the count to inspect the most awaited prize: the spoils. An old dwarf opened a hidden chamber in the rock, and within we found a treasury crammed with gold. He said a third belonged to our lord, another to the common defense funds, and as thanks they gifted us several runic weapons.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.Thɪs updatᴇd by\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

To them were added thousands more who had emerged from the overcrowded caverns around Karaz-a-Karak, where the pressure of numbers was unbearable, and who now found in war an opportunity to reclaim the place their ancestors had lost. Dozens of thanes, each with their clans, had descended into the tunnels with the determination to retake the forgotten strongholds that for centuries had been stolen from them.\nAlmost thirty thousand additional dawi had joined our forces. Though many lacked the heavy plate armor that marked the veterans, they fulfilled their role: reinforcing the weaker lines, guarding the freshly raised walls, and holding back the green-skin advances with discipline. The mere sight of them standing shoulder to shoulder against orkish charges was reason enough to acknowledge that change had taken root.\nThe hardest task had not been arming so many, but getting them to set aside their ancestral rivalries. For that I resorted to the one tool that, in any society, binds stronger than powder or steel: blood ties. I arranged treaties of future marriages between clans—promises that, though still distant, compelled both fathers and sons to look in the same direction. The number of dwarf women had always been scarce, and I knew such pacts were more valuable than any treasure. I even contributed part of my own rewards to ensure the dowries, a gesture that the clans deeply respected. The betrothal ceremonies were public and celebrated with fervor, though the true wedding rituals remained secret among the dawi. That mattered little to me; what was essential was that the oath was sworn, and with it, the clans stood united.\nThat common front became reality. Some clans specialized in the production of firearms, others in forging armor, some traded with the human principalities to obtain timber and other resources scarce in the mountains, while others contributed food and ale thanks to fertile lands under their influence. There were also the clans devoted to reinforcing tunnels, raising gates and walls, and those who sent masses of their youth to be trained, having either large families or a greater share of women. Step by step, the diversity of efforts meshed like cogs in a mechanism, shaping a war-machine both solid and, above all, cohesive.\nAs for myself, I kept pushing the campaign forward with greater speed thanks to the new weapons the dawi engineer had placed in our hands. His creations proved brutally effective: at close range they tore through orks in a storm of lead, and as for the goblins—they were pierced as if made of parchment. Their efficiency was such that I made a risky decision: to divide our forces and cleanse two karaks at once. It was a perilous move, demanding we spread both firepower and logistics thin, but in the end it doubled our pace of advance. Fortune favored us, for the greenskin presence in the tunnels was not as strong as we had feared, and with constant pressure and the methodical use of powder and steel, we overwhelmed them with ease. What once seemed impossible—forcing their retreat and securing firm ground—now unfolded as a series of methodical engagements, door by door, corridor by corridor, until each karak was restored to its rightful owners.\nThough I had set out with the intent of reaching Karak Eight Peaks, or at least reclaiming another fortress of renown, I could say without hesitation that to have liberated nearly ninety karaks was already, in itself, a monumental achievement. With that, we had secured almost two-thirds of the Southern Mountains, especially since the greenskin resistance, though numerous overall, never gathered in a single front. Added together they numbered in the hundreds of thousands, yet we never faced more than two thousand at a time—allowing us to advance with relative ease, crushing scattered garrisons and poorly defended camps.\nTo the misfortune of those thanes who had not yet reclaimed their strongholds, I could go no further. Harvest season was drawing near, and I was bound to return to my lands. That time of year was always critical: without my presence, the cults tended to stir unrest among the folk, and there was also the risk of Norse raids that might exploit any weakness. My duty to the Empire and to my people called me back, even if the dawi tunnels and vows had to remain unfinished for now.\nTrusting that what I had left behind was strong enough to withstand the greenskin onslaughts, I resolved to organize our return. I immediately began sending my wealth back to Reikland: coffers brimming with gold, ingots stacked in columns, and chests of gems and silver, all transported in successive aerial convoys to prevent losses. It was not a swift process, but a secure one, and it allowed my men to return by air before the weather turned. The cold in the mountain peaks could make any journey a torment.\nUpon leaving the tunnels, I found that the great dawi camp at the mountain's edge had diminished greatly. Of the countless clans that had gathered there, nearly a quarter million dwarfs had already returned to their restored karaks, easing the suffocating overcrowding that plagued Karaz-a-Karak. Those who remained were the thanes still awaiting their turn, hoping that the oath-keeping umgi would one day come to reclaim their homes. I could promise nothing immediate, but I assured them that, as soon as my obligations allowed, I would return to continue the unification of the mountains under the banner of the dawi.\nFor myself, the campaign left me burdened with gold—so much that its transport would take months—and armed with more than a hundred runic pieces, gifts from grateful clans that could no longer pay me in treasure. With that hoard secured, we began the return to Karaz-a-Karak, taking my entire host with me.\nBefore departing to my domains, I requested an audience with the High King. I had to make clear that my Sigmarite pilgrimage had concluded, and that I intended to return to my lands—but I also wished to depart with his blessing. It was necessary he understood that I was not fleeing my obligations, but rather summoned by higher duties in my homeland.\nThis time, thanks to the prestige earned in the campaigns, there was no delay. I was led at once into the throne hall. There sat Thorgrim, the High King and Bearer of Grudges, upon his stone throne, stern and immovable, the eternal Book of Grudges open before him upon a rune-carved table. The quill rested in his hand, stained with that reddish ink, while the elder councillors muttered around the chamber.\n\"So then, umgi… what brings you once more before me?\" asked Thorgrim, his deep voice echoing across the walls like the strike of a hammer upon rock.\n\"I requested this audience, High King, to inform you that I must soon withdraw to my lands. The harvest season approaches, and with it, troubles. My people need me, and my duty to the Empire calls. Much as I wish to finish what I have begun, cleansing the Southern Mountains entirely of the urks, I must first see to what is mine,\" I answered respectfully, bowing my head.\n\"So you would consider your mission complete…\" murmured Thorgrim, closing the Book for a moment with a heavy sound. \"From what I have heard, you have rendered great service to many of our thanes. But before I allow you to depart, there is a matter that weighs upon me. And since you have won a measure of honor in my eyes, I grant you the right to answer before I decide whether to write your name in these pages.\" His eyes fixed upon me like burning stones.\nI tensed, surprised. To my knowledge, I had done nothing to provoke such a grievance.\n\"Please, High King, allow me to hear what just reproach lies against me,\" I said calmly, though the tension in my lips betrayed me.\n\"It has been told to me,\" Thorgrim continued in an inquisitorial tone, \"that you have been arranging marriage contracts between dawi clans… and more than that, that you have funded such promises with your own gold. Tell me, umgi, what was your intent? Did you seek to meddle in the secrets of our sacred traditions?\" His words rang with suspicion, and several councillors growled low.\n\"No, never, High King,\" I replied firmly, raising my voice. \"I never wished to profane your customs. My only purpose was to ensure that rivalries between clans would not weaken them before the true enemy. The mountains are infested with greenskins, and without cooperation, each clan would fall isolated, one after another. I feared that in my absence, internal disputes might condemn your folk. That is why I urged them to seal oaths of union, and in some cases, I aided with my own gold to cover the dowries demanded. All so they might see one another as kin, not rivals. To fight together, not divided.\"\nI fell silent, letting my words settle like dust in the tunnels.\nThorgrim placed his heavy hands upon the table, the quill unmoving, his eyes hard upon me.\n\"Hmmm…\" he growled slowly. \"I believe your words, umgi. You have shown honor in restoring ancestral homes to my people. I will accept that your intent was sincere, though I shall watch that your deeds bear no hidden shadow. Let it be known in this hall: I place my trust in you. Your actions shall be remembered.\"\nThen he raised his voice, so grave it thundered through the chamber like a storm in the mountains. \"You have my blessing to return to your home.\"\n\"Thank you, High King,\" I answered, bowing my head. \"It is my hope to return soon, to fight once more alongside your honorable warriors and continue the reclamation of the lands that belong to your ancestors. You have my word.\"\n\"Wait, umgi…\" Thorgrim interrupted, lifting a hand. \"I will not allow so great a service to my people to go unrewarded. It would be dishonor to me… and to the whole line of Grungni.\"\nHe turned to his councillors and began to speak in Khazalid, his deep voice mixing with the elders who replied with fervor. The debate was long and intense.\nI waited in silence, watching how they leaned toward one another, how grave voices rose, until at last the High King looked at me again.\n\"In consideration of your friendship with the dawi of the Grey Mountains and the service you have rendered our people, you shall be granted a runic weapon of great power. I trust you will put it to good use, and that many foes of the dawi and the Empire will fall beneath its blows,\" declared the High King, his voice echoing through the chamber.\nAt once, a reverent silence fell over all present. Minutes passed before a group of royal smiths emerged from a side entrance. They walked slowly, firmly, bearing a great chest covered in runes that glowed faintly under the light of the shining stones. The elder councillors fell into silence.\nThe smiths halted before me. The eldest of them stepped forward and, with ritual gesture, opened the chest. Within lay a runic mace, forged of gromril.\n\"It was wrought for my ancestors by the greatest rune-masters, when our craft still bore the blessing of the Ancestor Gods, in the darkest hours of the War of the Ancients,\" Thorgrim explained, leaning forward slightly. \"It has remained guarded for generations, awaiting one worthy to wield it. With it many elgi perished, and I expect more enemies yet shall fall. May this weapon, born of forge and rune, carry the judgment of the dawi wherever you raise it.\"\nThe King allowed himself the faintest smile, a glimmer of pride as he recalled the days when the elgi had fallen beneath that very weapon.\nI took the mace with both hands. It was heavy, though still possible to wield one-handed, yet I felt at once that the runes etched into the gromril pulsed with an inner power that coursed through my arms. As I moved it for the first time, I understood this was no mere relic: the mace exuded tremendous force.\n\"Thank you, High King. I shall put it to good use. I swear I will destroy the enemies of the Empire and of the dawi with this weapon.\"\n\"Good, umgi,\" Thorgrim answered, striking the stone table with his closed fist. \"You are invited to the ceremony of settling grudges. There, before the Ancestors, you must speak with your own voice of the wrongs that have been mended and those that yet remain. Thus it shall be recorded forever in the Book.\"\n\"Of course, High King. I shall be there,\" I replied, gripping the runic mace firmly as a barely contained smile spread across my face.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

At the same time, I attended the daily ceremonies held in the great halls of Karaz-a-Karak for the settling of grudges, where the High King himself presided, the Book of Grudges open upon his stone table, surrounded by the elders of his council.\nThere, before dozens of thanes and clan representatives, Thorgrim heard each case one by one: ancestral disputes, grievances against the urks, commercial affronts, or ancient debts. Between ten and twenty grudges were resolved each day, solemnly struck from the Dammaz Kron once they were declared settled. The dawi rejoiced at every resolution, for each closed page meant their honor endured and the wounds of their people began to heal.\nJoy was palpable. After generations of overcrowding in stifling caverns, now the clans were reclaiming their ancestral strongholds and a measure of their dignity. Around forty karaks yet remained to be freed in the south before the mountains could be declared secure, but the High King had already announced that his own host would take up the task, unless dire need forced otherwise.\nMeanwhile, I sought to uphold the policy of cooperation among the clans, fostering unity. During those days of waiting, while my men and wealth were steadily carried home, I busied myself negotiating with dwarfen nobles: I discussed with merchant guilds potential trade routes, contracts for selling dwarf goods in my lands, and above all, the purchase of wares that might sustain my future industry. Many merchants were already diverting their caravans towards the lands of Duran, knowing they would find there both safety and reliable raw materials.\nOn one occasion, I was honored by Thorgrim himself, who showed me one of his most treasured possessions: the crown of Phoenix King Caledor II, seized from the elgi during the ancestral war. Its brilliance was striking, but more striking still was the pride radiating from the dawi who beheld it. Each dwarf who laid eyes upon that relic left the hall with his face alight, satisfied that the offense against their people remained remembered and recorded. Their hatred of the elgi, I understood, burned as fiercely as if the war had been yesterday.\nEvery grievance in which I took part, whether as witness or mediator, was celebrated. In the end, my name was inscribed as a participant in dozens, even hundreds of grudges now stricken from the solemn records of the dawi.\nBefore my departure, I received one final gift. This time it did not come directly from the High King, but from the Council of Elders, who wished to reward me in the name of all dwarfkind. They bestowed upon me a runic ring, wrought with the same mastery as the mace I already bore. Three runes were etched into it: one that repelled hostile sorcery, another that granted the bearer deep rest, and a last that silenced armor entirely, erasing the metallic sound of every movement. Such a powerful item, I was told, was the sort only rune-masters themselves might wear.\nI accepted the gift with solemnity, though inwardly I wondered if the rune that repelled magic might interfere with my own arts. Even so, I knew it was a token that sealed the trust the dawi had placed in me.\nAt last, the day of departure arrived. Several members of the Council of Elders bade me farewell, wishing me a swift and untroubled journey. We boarded the air-fleet and began the return. The voyage was calm, my coffers of gold secured, and in the skies my griffon soared and played around the flying ships, beating its wings with more strength than before.\nWe crossed the frozen passes of the mountains, where the cold was harsher than on our way in, yet it did not halt us. At last we reached the Empire, where the mild climate of harvest season greeted us like a balm.\nWe descended near my laboratory, where a group of dwarfs sent by Duran awaited eagerly, full of questions about the campaign. They wished to know whether I had reached Karak Eight Peaks, but I explained the situation in Karaz-a-Karak and the priority of consolidating the south. They understood at once, returning to their work with serious yet satisfied expressions.\nMeanwhile, the workers began unloading the vast wealth of gold brought back from the expedition. I gathered my men, gave them their due rewards for their service, and sent my share directly to my treasuries, spread among my cities, to finance the great expansion project that awaited me.\nThe gold was immense, yet so too was the task ahead.\nIn my absence, much had changed. From the Bretonnian campaign to my departure into the dwarfen mountains, Imperial politics had taken their course. When the Emperor declared the war in Bretonnia concluded, he withdrew all the state troops involved—and my contacts in the regiments did the rest: they guided those veterans straight to me, remembering well the treatment they had received under my command.\nThus I gathered ten thousand veterans into my ranks, drawn from all corners of Reikland. Following my orders, the dwarf council I had left behind in my lands moved them at once to Marienburg, to settle the city and strengthen it. There, eight thousand remained as a permanent garrison, reorganized into companies with captains for each district. The other two thousand were assigned to guard the naval fortresses protecting the approach to the ports.\nAlongside them, some eighty thousand more souls had migrated into Marienburg—the families of the guards, drawn by the wealth the city offered under my rule. In this way, Marienburg was beginning once again to grow, rising towards the size and stature it had once known.\nIn my three cities the growth had been steady through births, while all migration was being directed towards the newly-drained lands of the marshes.\nRecently, however, another massive wave of settlers had arrived from every province of the Empire. The Emperor had issued a second call for colonization, sending not only those who sought new opportunities in my lands but also beggars, the homeless poor, and all manner of social misfits from the great cities, to populate the new frontier in Bretonnia.\nIn my lands nearly one hundred thousand souls disembarked, drawn mainly from Averland, Wissenland, and Middenland. For them, small villages and hamlets were swiftly being raised across the vast plains, while the sea of Bretonnians who still remained in my domains continued crowded in emergency shelters, waiting for the draining of the marshes to be finished so they could finally settle.\nAt last I set out by rail towards Marienburg to review the city's progress. The journey was brief, for the trains now ran at full speed, crossing freshly sown fields and villages still under construction. Upon my arrival at the station, I was received by a group of officials who administered the city under the supervision of my dwarfen councillors.\n\"Well then, inform me of the city's affairs,\" I ordered as we made our way towards the palace.\nOne of the port officials spoke first. \"The Emperor has left much of the second Imperial fleet docked in the military piers, my lord. They await your authorization to remain for the long term.\"Follow current novels on ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"If they take charge of protecting commerce in my seas, so be it. Send confirmation of my permission to the Emperor,\" I answered without breaking my stride.\nI noticed the great number of ambassadors and diplomats in the city. There was far more movement than usual, a sure sign that Marienburg was regaining its former importance.\n\"Anything else?\" I asked, glancing at my advisors.\nThe agricultural councillor spoke with a worried expression. \"My lord… the granaries are in danger. With so many people arriving at once, we face the prospect of famine. The new lands will only begin producing next year, provided the dwarfen engineers finish the drainage of the marshes in time. Until then, this year's reserves will not suffice to reach the next harvest. We could run out of grain at the beginning of the coming year.\"\nI pressed my lips together and replied calmly: \"Then we must move ahead of the crisis. Travel to Averland, Wissenland, and the great estates of Reikland. Buy up all the grain you can while the harvest prices are still low. Contact Rutger and have him purchase as much as possible before the speculators drive the price up. I want the granaries full before anyone else attempts to hoard it for profit.\"\n\"Yes, my lord, I will inform him at once,\" the man replied, bowing before hurrying away.\nAnother of my aides, an emissary of the dwarfen engineers, spoke next in his dry, meticulous tone: \"My lord, an agreement has been reached with the Elector Count of Wissenland for the establishment of a railway line to Nuln. The plans are complete, awaiting your approval for the dwarfen lodges to begin their work.\"\n\"I shall review the details later. Leave them on my desk,\" I answered as we crossed the threshold of the Marienburg palace.\nOne of my secretaries continued, agenda in hand, reading in haste as he struggled to match my pace. \"My lord, Kislevite diplomats request an audience. They seek to purchase large lots of firearms from our manufactories and require your permission for the sale. The chief envoy is already in the city, awaiting your arrival.\n\"The Grand Theogonist also invites you to a ceremony in your honor, and the Arch-Lector of Reikland requests a meeting regarding the construction of new churches and chapels. The Cult of Sigmar has sent nearly three hundred thousand crowns for this purpose.\"\nHe turned another page before adding: \"Ambassadors from Tilea, Estalia, and Miragliano also await. They wish not only to purchase arms but to discuss a preferential trade treaty that would reduce port tariffs and docking fees. Lastly, a great dwarfen vessel docked a month ago: its emissaries seek authorization to establish a dwarfen shipyard in Marienburg, taking advantage of the naval infrastructure your lordship has built.\"\n\"Ah… one of those gigantic dawi vessels has docked in my harbors, then. What cargo did it carry?\" I asked with interest.\n\"Beer, my lord. A great deal of beer, sold to the dwarfs of the city's artisan quarter. They also purchased large amounts of timber from Middenland merchants, and they wished to buy ores in bulk, but nothing beyond that,\" my aide replied.\n\"And how goes the matter of the salt? Is it already functioning?\" I asked as we finally reached my study, where I was surrounded by dwarfs handing me reports of revenue.\n\"It is already functioning, my lord. Nearly five thousand workers have been hired in the industry, and the boilers produce vast quantities of salt each day. Almost all of it is being sold to Kislev, at the same price they once paid when Marienburg was under its former directors. Thanks to this, we now enjoy very considerable income,\" said my aide, handing me the reports.\n\"Good… now it is my turn to work. I expect the Emperor will summon me soon to discuss important matters, and I cannot afford to leave all this unattended. Call in the Kislevite envoy to begin talks on the sale of firearms and powder,\" I replied, settling into my seat.\nMeanwhile, I began reviewing the paperwork my dwarfen councillors had prepared: supply contracts, mining ledgers, and petitions from guilds seeking licenses. The silence of the chamber was broken only by the crackle of coal in the fireplace and the distant voices of my officials working in the adjoining offices.\nIt was curious how, even after vanishing for months in military campaigns, the weight of governance would fall once more upon my shoulders without mercy. I had succeeded in delegating much into competent hands, yet chaos always found its way through, forcing me to restore order with my own hand.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

All to fill the granaries of the Lord of Marienburg and prevent famine in his lands. It was no small task; tens of thousands of mouths depended on it not turning against him… and by extension, against me.\nThings had turned grim some months ago, when the city of my birth was conquered and, worse still, massacred. I had known it as the greatest port of the Old World, filled with the cries of stevedores, the scent of salt and spices, and ships arriving from places not even charted with certainty on maps. Now, none of that remained. The gold I had once helped generate ended up financing the fall of my own republic. Yes, perhaps the blame is mine. If I had not worked for him, another would have… but the profits were too great to ignore. Money has no homeland—and neither do I, for that same reason.\nMarienburg was humiliated and ruined. Three out of four of its people ended up dead by the sword, devoured by daemons, or served as meat for that vampire roaming free. And the worst, at least for me, was not the slaughter itself, but the triumph of the Cult of Sigmar over that of Manann. The temples, my faith, reduced to ashes, and my priests begging like any peasant. They thought themselves magnanimous to leave them with the clothes on their backs, but they stripped them of everything else. I saw pyres burning day and night, with men and women aflame, accused of witchcraft, treason, or simply of keeping the wrong friends. Ambassadors hanged like thieves, foreign merchants executed without trial, sailors without flags butchered in the streets. The city was left empty, mute—where once there had been life, there was only fear.\nI saved my family only because I had the favor of the city's new master. The conqueror. In the first phase of the siege they hid, and when the witch hunters came with their pyres, he interceded at my request. He did not do it out of kindness, I know, but because he still needed me. I was one of the few who emerged intact from the political and religious purge. The other powerful merchants either died in battle or were dragged to the gallows. Some survivors now skulk in hiding, swearing they will gather mercenaries to retake the city. Fools. That dream died with their families in the flames.\nToday, Marienburg is not Marienburg. Its houses and docks are occupied by Reiklanders loyal to Sigmar. It no longer smells of spice, but of iron and brick. If the city ever regains its freedom, it will not be in my lifetime. The dream of the republic drowned in the Reik River. But commerce… ah, commerce always survives.\nAnd in the midst of all this ruin, I have ended up in an enviable position. I serve the undisputed master of the city, with direct access to his goods and his friendship with the dwarfs. What costs others a fortune, I obtain for a pittance. I hold rights to a percentage of his sales, and I can purchase goods cheap to resell in places I once could never have reached. The wholesalers who once saw me as a minor competitor now look at me with suspicion, for I control wares they can only dream of handling. All thanks to this new Elector…\n\"Well then, how goes it?\" I asked the foreman of Marienburg's saltworks about the day's production.\n\"All according to what the dwarf master established. We are producing around ten tons of salt per day,\" said the foreman as he showed me the huge piles of sacks his men were loading into the train compartments bound for Altdorf.\n\"Excellent. Then when can I take my share to Altdorf to sell?\" I asked, watching the workers empty salt from one of those dwarfen boilers that seemed to be forever boiling.\n\"We have reserves ready for transport. Two hundred tons are going directly to Erengrad, purchased by the Kislevites, and one hundred and fifty tons are available for you to take to Altdorf,\" replied the foreman, using the metric system which was becoming increasingly popular in the Westerlands—and which I had been forced to learn.\n\"One hundred and fifty tons… one hundred and fifty thousand kilos at three shillings the kilo… twenty-two thousand five hundred crowns. That is what I can earn in Altdorf. And if I understand correctly, that is just the base cost, isn't it? This sort of production requires no wood or fuel, correct?\" I said aloud, running the numbers in my head while keeping my eyes on the boilers that evaporated the water.\n\"Indeed. The dwarf master designed the system so it never cools. It is always hot and must be handled carefully, but we avoid the constant nuisance of lighting fires. The water separated from the salt runs through those pipes into reserves used by some of Count Albrecht's industries.\" The foreman pointed towards the network of pipes extending beyond the facility.\n\"Ah… so that is where the water comes from. In Marienburg, it was difficult to find surplus that did not come from the swamps, and those who drank from it ended up sick and dying in the privy,\" I remarked, following the maze of pipes with my eyes.\n\"Yes, here the water is safe. Some dwarf brewmasters have even found a way to use it for making proper beer. The first attempts were tasteless swill, but at last they discovered the method to make it worthwhile,\" the foreman replied.\n\"I see… then make sure all the salt is loaded onto the train as soon as possible. I'll continue reviewing production with the other foremen to calculate recent sales.\" I walked away at a brisk pace, already turning my thoughts towards the soapworks that had recently opened in Marienburg—another business I needed to inspect.\nThe soapworks had been set up near the salt production boilers, making use of the same pipes that supplied the water needed for the process. The smell was unmistakable: the sharp mix of boiled fish, offal, and melting fat. That stench was the hallmark of the fish industries, and one of the reasons why many in Marienburg had always despised this kind of manufacture.\nIn front of the entrance stretched a long line of workers gutting fish, stripping them of entrails and leaving them clean to be carried into the vats where the fat would be rendered for soap. It was not the first time someone had tried to produce soap from fish fat in the city; it had always been a poor business. The chief problem was the odor and consistency: rough, unpleasant soaps, which could only be sold to the Cult of Shallya, since wealthy folk preferred the imported soaps of Tilea or Estalia, made from finer, less foul-smelling fats.\nBut the dwarfs had found a way to cleanse the fat and strip it of its stench, producing vast quantities of quality soap. They mostly used the surplus fish brought by dwarfen ships, those that dragged massive nets and supplied the entire city.\nUpon entering the soapworks, the contrast struck me. The interior was filled with pleasant aromas: dried flowers, herbs, and perfumed oils used to scent the soaps. The atmosphere was far more tolerable than the reek outside.\n\"How goes production?\" I asked, fixing my gaze on the foreman, a stern-faced man checking a ledger while watching the piles of finished lots.\n\"Oh, Rutger… yes, all well,\" he answered with some unease. \"I'm afraid I have nothing to offer you for transport.\"\nI frowned. \"How so? I can see great quantities stacked there myself.\"\n\"Yes, but the entire production has already been purchased by the Cult of Shallya. New temples are being built in every town and city, and they need soap in enormous amounts. Our whole output goes to them. In fact, I have more orders than I can meet, so for quite some time there will be nothing available for you.\"\n\"Damnation…\" I muttered in frustration. \"Very well, I suppose it will have to be another time.\" And I walked away, grinding my anger between my teeth.\nThere was plenty of industry in the city, all under the control of the Elector Count, and many aimed directly at supplying the Cult of Shallya: soaps, bandages, medicinal plants gathered from the marshes —though fewer with each passing month, as thousands of dwarfs and Bretonnians labored day and night to drain the land and turn it into fertile fields. I had seen the convoys of workers and the drainage engines myself, like ants devouring a swamp that would soon be arable soil.\nI also knew of more ambitious projects underway, such as a sea farm for breeding oysters to harvest pearls. The Count said the venture would take at least a year to yield results, but he was determined to fill every last train wagon with profitable goods.\nMuch of the day I spent arranging the purchase of spices and jewels from the merchants arriving in port. Many of them would not risk the long journey to the Imperial cities, and I was there to seize the opportunity: spices of Araby acquired at absurdly low prices, whole shipments of cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg that in Altdorf would sell as treasures. Also jewels from Tilea and Estalia, mined and crafted with a quality few Imperial workshops could rival. Buy cheap on the coast and sell dear in the heart of the Empire: the perfect trade.\nWith the train already half-filled with salt, spices, jewels, and timber, we set out towards the Elector's mountain fortress. In just a few hours, from the windows I could see the old swamps already turned into dry, fertile lands, thanks to the tireless work of dwarfs and Bretonnians. There, in the fortress, they loaded my wagons with huge amounts of dyes: deep blues, bright reds, vivid yellows and oranges, all ready to be sold at high prices in the cities where nobility paid fortunes for colorful fabrics. But what caught my eye most were the barrels of smokeless powder, the new flagship product. That substance sold like hot bread to the state regiments; every army of the Empire wanted its share.\nContinuing the journey, we reached Reinsfeld, where my workers were already waiting with fresh cargo prepared. There we loaded tools of every kind, firearms in large quantities bound for the Emperor's armies, fine jewelry crafted by the dwarfen artisans of the city—delicate pieces, worked with the patience and perfection only they possessed—and luxury furniture, built by those same dwarfs for the houses of human nobles ever eager to flaunt their wealth.\nThe train was packed to the brim when at last we set out for Altdorf. Night had already fallen, and within hours we reached the great capital of the Empire. Around the train station stretched a vast improvised market. Hundreds of merchants sought to sell their goods or hire transport towards Marienburg. The din was deafening, with vendors shouting, wheels rattling under loads of wares, and torchlight illuminating a crowd eager to trade.\nThe designated priests did not take long to appear. Those carrion hounds always arrive first when there is something valuable to sniff out. But business is business, and they took all the smokeless powder I had available. Only they were authorized to distribute it within the Empire, for the Elector feared that some wizard, too curious, might uncover the secret of its making.\nQuickly, my dozens of workers loaded much of the cargo onto carts, and we began dispatching them across the network of Imperial cities: Nuln, Middenheim, Talabheim—anywhere there were customers willing to pay. I, for my part, turned to my contacts in Altdorf to place the most valuable wares. While some sold, I bought. I began hoarding all the grain I could find, sending my men across the villages of minor lords to purchase every last sack of cereal.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

There were so many projects they nearly covered the entire desk: designs for new cities rising in those fertile lands where once there had been nothing but swamps and marshes.\n\"Your new mortar is already in production, my lord. It is only a matter of time before we can begin with the foundations of the new structures,\" answered one of the trusted men of the dawi master of architecture, bowing his head respectfully. His hands were stained with chalk and dust, clear signs he had come straight from the works.\n\"Good… good. With steel and cement we can build upwards, make better use of space. But the problem remains the sewers. Has the master already instructed you how to handle waste? Being so far from the sea or a river, it's no small challenge,\" I said, running my fingers along the edges of the map.\n\"The honorable master has designed a system inspired by dawi methods of reuse, my lord. It is a network of pipes and channels leading to sedimentation chambers. There, solid waste will be separated from liquids; the first will be treated to be used as fertilizer, while the latter will be purified and then returned into the system by steam pumps. Waste will be reduced to a minimum, ensuring a continuous cycle,\" he explained with a proud gleam in his eyes.\n\"Ah… the ingenuity of the dawi. Taking them as allies was the best decision I ever made. And about Thorek? Did you give him my plan for land use and the possible damages?\" I asked, turning now to one of the assistants of the master of agriculture.\n\"Master Thorek reported that he took your instructions into account. He consulted old texts from when the dawi still cultivated the surface and not only the deeps, and he warned that the land must be reinforced against erosion. He recommended raising lines of trees to block the winds from the north, and creating wetlands and artificial ponds to store excess water in this rainy region. That way we'll avoid floods and guarantee reserves for times of drought,\" answered the assistant, holding a parchment full of notes.\n\"Excellent. You have permission to move all the resources you need. That dawi gold our allies entrusted to us must be well spent. And we must ensure the next harvest is abundant, because this year we will not have enough income from food,\" I said, with a bitter smile at the memory of recent losses.\n\"Yes, my lord. The dawi and the Bretonnians are already working in the dry zones. They have begun digging for the wetlands and planting trees brought from the greenhouses. They will grow slowly, but as our master always repeats: what is steady is what lasts,\" he answered with an optimistic smile.\nI was about to continue the meeting when I heard shouting in the hallway. The murmurs in the room died at once. Instinctively, I reached for my mace, resting by the table. The cries drew nearer, until the doors burst open with a crash.\n\"I'll say it again! The Count will see no one today!\" shouted one of my guards, standing in the way of a group of elves who struggled to force their way in. Apparently my men had tried to obey the order not to disturb the elven visitors… but had done so in the worst possible manner.\n\"Let them through,\" I ordered calmly, raising a hand before the situation worsened. My guards, who had been on the verge of driving them out by force, halted at once and withdrew with discipline.\nThen the hall filled with light steps and tense gazes. A group of forty elves advanced, forming a protective circle around a noble of their kind. He bore no weapon, but his bearing was noble and his face showed barely contained anger. His companions rested their hands on their sword hilts, watching every move of my men with the cold readiness of those prepared to spill blood if need be.\n\"And to what do I owe this displeasure, elgi…?\" I asked, fixing my gaze on the elf noble, who frowned back at me.\n\"A mortal speaking like the beasts of the mountains… how amusing,\" said the elf.\n\"Mind your tongue, elgi! None insult our friends of the mountains—and least of all when you stand in my damned city, breaking my rules. Do you hear me, long-ears?\" I shouted, raising the runic mace. The glow of its runes lit up in the elves' eyes, and the noble's stare fixed on the weapon with evident unease.\n\"I would not have to be here if you kept your treaties, mortal…\" the elf retorted, his voice dripping with condescension that made the blood boil, though for the first time he appeared more cautious.\n\"And what treaties would those be, long-ears?\" I asked with sarcasm, tightening the helm of my armor, the metal ringing as it locked into place.\n\"The treaty of friendship and trade between our people and the city of Marienburg,\" answered the elf, stepping forward with his brow raised high, as if he were walking into a royal hall and not my war chamber.\n\"Ah… and what of it?\" I replied, pointing the mace at him, relishing how his guards stiffened at the gesture.\n\"Two of mine have vanished in your ports,\" the noble snarled, stabbing a long, dagger-like finger at me. \"They disappeared under the watch of your dog-guards, and none of them can give an answer. Two of our kin have vanished, and we have seen no patrols searching for the slightest trace. Does your word mean nothing, mortal?\"\n\"Well… what a tragedy. Two dead elgi,\" I answered with feigned pity. \"Shall I arrange a state funeral as well? Or would you rather I send Sigmar's priests to sing them hymns?\"\nThe noble's face twisted, and an angry murmur rippled through his guards.\n\"I want them found, mortal! How hard can it be? Two of ours have vanished, and your soldiers strut about as if nothing had happened!\" shouted the elf.\n\"Because it is not an emergency,\" I replied coldly. \"They are two elves, not half a city. My guards patrol, and if they have seen nothing, then there is nothing to see. Stop your whining and leave. Today I am in a good mood, so I will ignore your insolence.\"\nThe noble glared at me. \"If you do nothing, I will consider our treaty ended,\" he said, his tone icy, heavy with threat.\nI began to step forward. His guards raised their shields instinctively, closing ranks around their lord.\n\"If that happens,\" I answered in a low but firm voice, \"I will have you thrown out of here myself. And I won't stop there… I'll summon my army, line up my cannons, and reduce Elftown to ashes. So tell me, long-ears… do we have a treaty, or do we not?\"\nThe silence in the hall was heavy, broken only by the crackle of the torches and the metallic rasp of my men's gauntlets as their hands rested on their sword-hilts.\n\"The wrath of the Phoenix King would be terrible,\" the elf noble said.\n\"Ah… adding another powerful enemy to the list, are you? First your druchii cousins, then the dawi, and now the Empire. Do you wish to undo all the progress made by Archmage Teclis, eh, elf? The azur are in no state to seek more wars… unless you want the druchii walking your shores while you divert your strength to defend your pride,\" I said, staring at him unblinking.\nThe noble did not answer, but his lips moved in a murmur in his ancestral tongue. I didn't need to know every word to understand he was cursing me with everything he had.\n\"Leave now, elgi, before I consider the treaty broken by your insolence. But know this: there will be changes after this act, and the Emperor will learn of your disrespect. The Phoenix King will hear of what took place today, and why those changes came.\" I pointed the mace towards the door.\n\"And what of—\" he began to shout.\n\"Leave, elgi! This is your final warning.\" My voice rang so powerfully the torches seemed to waver for a moment. Just then, more of my men entered the hall, and outside, the sound of armored steps multiplied. The disadvantage was clear. None of the elves were mages; without sorcery, their blades and their pride would not be enough.\nThe noble drew a long breath, spoke softly to his own, and at last they withdrew—not without looks of venom thrown in my direction. Once the hall was free, I turned to my aides, who still looked tense.\n\"What do we know of this disappearance of the elgi?\" I asked one of my captains.\n\"Not much, my lord. Supposedly they vanished in the night. The night watch saw nothing; we only learned the next morning, when the elves began searching for their kin. It was near the docks. Witch hunters helped sweep the area, but found nothing.\"\n\"Nothing… eh?\" I murmured, crossing my arms. My mind was already forming hypotheses. A cult of Slaanesh, perhaps—an elven soul was a feast for that god. Or maybe skaven, always in need of flesh and test subjects for their experiments.\n\"Very well. Sweep the area twice more. Ask if anyone saw or heard anything—even the last drunkard in the taverns.\" My men nodded and hurried out.\nThe rest of the day I gave to routine: reviewing documents, sending orders north, meeting Tilean diplomats, fixing a date with the Kislevite envoy, sealing deals with merchants. But when night fell, I chose to act alone.\nWith the ring that granted me absolute silence and a cloak that dulled the glint of my runic armor, I slipped through the city like a shadow. No one heard me, no one saw me. Using my magic, I began to scan the port. Everything looked normal: warehouses shut, patrols yawning, the odd staggering sailor. No hidden tunnels, no traces of the elves. No long-ear heartbeat betraying blood vessels or hearts.\nUntil I felt it. Something moved beneath my feet, in the sewers.\n\"Ah, damn… skaven. Why couldn't it be a common slaver?\" I muttered, searching for the nearest entry.\nI preferred to go alone: that way I could use my magic without disguising it as a miracle of Sigmar, and move faster without questions. I lifted the grate and descended. The stench was unbearable, like breathing liquid rot. The passage was ancient, the stones worn and wet, fissures dripping foul water.\n\"This whole cursed city will have to be demolished and rebuilt,\" I growled, breathing through my mouth.\nI focused and pressed on, following the trail of a skaven scurrying nervously, glancing about as though hunted by his own fears. I followed for long minutes until he stopped in a deeper tunnel. There I found the breach: a fresh hole in the sewer wall, through which the vermin crawled.\nI entered without hesitation. Darkness was near-total, but the minerals in the walls I could magically feel where I was walking.\nAs soon as I stepped through, I saw two skaven devouring a third, already dead, tearing at the flesh with shrill squeals. So engrossed were they in their feast they did not notice me.\nThe first only realized when his skull burst beneath my mace. The second shrieked like the damned, but had no time—one more swing crushed his head, every bone snapping.\n\"Ha… you can hear every bone break,\" I said with a crooked grin, as skaven blood ran between the stones.\nI pressed on. With every step, their numbers grew. I went lower and lower, until I came upon a vast cavern beneath the city's edge. Dozens of skaven swarmed there: some mining the rock, others fighting amongst themselves, with corpses devoured on the spot.\n\"A good chance to test whether the ring shields me from my own magic… at least it doesn't mute my senses,\" I muttered.\nThen I gathered my power, and the miners' picks began to twist, bending into blades that rose into the air. An instant later, the blades danced in the dark, cutting through bodies, severing limbs, slitting throats. Screeches echoed through the cavern as the rats fled in panic toward one particular tunnel.\n\"So that's the way…\" I murmured, walking among the severed bodies.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Despite his enormous size and the crushing weight of that Dwarf-forged shell, he moved in utter silence, as if he did not exist—only the runes carved upon his chest seemed real. Their faint glow lit the greasy damp of the cavern, sparking off pools of clotted blood and splintered bone.\nThe human advanced through the tunnels with the certainty of a born predator. Blind in absolute darkness, his senses stretched outward through his mastery of magic, feeling every movement, every quickened breath, every spark of fear. He sensed the presences packed tight like vermin—hundreds, thousands of Skaven crawling, scampering, tearing at each other with shrill squeals, devouring the weakest in frenzied hunger. None understood that they were already marked, already hunted by the monster walking among them.\nThe air cracked with the snap of a whip. A dry report followed by a strangled squeal.\n\" Work-work, lazy filth, useless meat!\" screeched a Skaven taskmaster from atop rotten scaffolding. His voice rasped like rusted iron scraping stone. His red eyes burned with fury as the starving slaves, ribs showing through matted fur, clawed at one another for scraps of flesh to avoid starving.\n\"Obey or die-die! The lash always hungry!\" he hissed, raising his arm and bringing down the blood-soaked leather again, tearing strips of hide from a wretch's bent back.\nThe shrieks of pain rose into a grotesque chorus, forcing the slaves to sink brittle claws into the rock, prying minerals loose with their rusted picks. Some, however, kept their eyes fixed on the convulsing body of a companion still gasping ragged breaths. They licked cracked lips, drooling, waiting for the instant the overseer looked away so they could leap upon the warm flesh.\nNone noticed the change at first. The tools in their paws trembled, vibrating as if some unseen force twisted them. In a blink, the iron picks warped, sharpened, became jagged blades. And without warning, they began rending Skaven flesh.\n\"Chiiiii! Pain-pain,!\" screeched one as the blade in his grip sank into his own gut, spilling black entrails across the stone. Another tried to flee, but his tool became a hook that ripped the throat from his neighbor. The air filled with the metallic, fetid stench of offal as guts slopped in thick pools across the floor.\nChaos multiplied. Corridors rang with shrill wails, Skaven crashing into each other, trampling, gnawing in blind panic. \"Flee-flee! Don't look back!\" they cried as they scattered in all directions, slick with the gore of their own kind. But there was no escape. Blades came from everywhere, slicing tendons, tearing limbs, plunging into bulging eyes.\nThrough the storm of iron, the colossal gromril figure advanced unstopping. His steps were slow, steady, as if walking a vacant road. His free hand drifted in the air, and around him every scrap of metal obeyed, dancing like a murderous swarm. With a mere gesture the blades answered, piercing bodies, flaying hides, leaving a trail of carnage that painted walls and ceiling with fresh blood.\n\"Man-thing!\" screeched a taskmaster, scuttling on all fours toward a tunnel while dozens of spinning blades whistled behind him. The echo of his claws hammering stone mingled with his shrill scream—until several blades struck his back with wet cracks. The creature shrieked so hard his voice snapped, coughing black blood before collapsing, thrashing.The most update n0vels are published on\nThe gromril colossus moved on, unshaken. He looked to his ring, its runic glow burning brighter than the other engravings on his armor.\n\"Smooth… channels magic easily,\" he murmured. \"Strange… a runesmith would not forge this for a wizard. Perhaps to magnify his own strength… or perhaps simply to leave a door open for one who could use it.\"\nThe human pressed forward. The tunnel lay carpeted with blood and mangled flesh. There, the overseer still clung to life, dragging himself with shattered claws, leaving a dark, slimy trail as his squeals dwindled to broken gasps.\n\"No-kill! I serve-serve!\" he whined, his shattered snout dripping spit and blood.\nA shadow fell over him. The human's boot came down, pressing his skull slowly into the wet rock. The Skaven kicked, clawed the air, thrashed as his shrieks climbed higher. With a dry crunch and a wet burst, his head exploded, splattering brain and bone across the stone.\nThe silence that followed was broken only by the metallic patter of blades, still slick with fresh blood, spinning obediently around the gromril figure.\nIn the deeper tunnels, Skaven fled in madness, shoving, clawing at one another as they sought escape from what they could not comprehend. The stink of fear and urine mixed with the smoke of dying torches.\n\"Man-thing, coming down!\" screeched one, tripping and smashing his teeth on the stone.\n\"What doing here! Why no warn!\" shrieked another, a warrior in corroded armor trembling as he clutched his rusted blade.\nThe tunnels swelled with Skaven crowding, jammed together like a wave of reeking bodies, waiting for the shadow to come. The air throbbed with nervous squeals, teeth chattering, claws raking stone.\n\"Kill-kill, eat his meat!\" howled a clanrat warrior, foaming as he waved his nicked sword.\nThen came the sound. A cold, metallic hiss, multiplied into a swarm. The blades erupted from the dark, spinning at inhuman speed. In heartbeats, the corridors became slaughterhouses: arms and legs hacked away, heads rolling with sprays of blood, walls painted red with hot splatter.\nThe clanrat did not falter. He loosed a war-squeal and charged down the tunnel, sword high. He managed no more than two steps before his own armor shrieked, crushing inward like an iron trap. The wet crunch of ribs snapping and lungs bursting echoed. His eyes bulged wide as blood gushed from his snout.\nAn invisible force lifted him into the air like a broken puppet and hurled him at full speed into the mass of Skaven behind. His shattered body became a projectile, crushing and ripping several apart, breaking bones and scattering entrails.\nThe tunnel erupted into chaos. Skaven squealed, \"Flee-flee, deeper-deeper!\" as they scrambled in terror toward the inner caverns, trampling the fallen, tearing off their own tails in frenzy to escape. But the blades pursued them, spinning like starving predators, reaping life after life with a whistle that left no room for hope.\n\"Uf… I've killed so many of these vermin… and I'm not even tired, no, not at all,\" murmured the human warrior, striding on without pause into the deepest hidden chambers.\nThe massacre lasted almost an hour. The tunnels filled with shrieks and blood as hundreds—perhaps thousands—of Skaven were torn from life, their bodies ground apart in caverns ever darker, deeper, beneath Marienburg. The human never stopped; anything that breathed, anything with blood, was exterminated with terrifying efficiency.\nAt last, he reached a vast cavern. Dozens of rails, corroded by warpstone, crossed the place, and thousands of Skaven slaves hacked at the rock, weakened and starving, under the watch of clan warriors. Taskmasters screeched frantic orders, and hundreds of warriors raised rusted weapons, forming a trembling barrier against the intruder.\nThe ground shook. A guttural roar heralded the charge of a rat ogre. The beast thundered through columns and rails, running on all fours, eyes blood-red with rage, drool hanging in thick ropes from its maw. Its massive body crashed forward with brute force.\nThe human, clad in gromril armor and glowing with rune-light, lifted his runic mace calmly. He smiled beneath the helm. He waited for the impact, and when the beast lunged, he struck with a devastating blow.\n\"BONK,\" the human said.\nThe sound boomed like thunder through the caverns. The rat ogre's skull fractured in dozens of places, caving under the rune-forged strike. The shockwave burst bones apart, its eyes exploding from their sockets in a bloody mist. The beast collapsed, convulsing, coughing green blood and foam as its claws scraped uselessly at the rock.\nNo respite came.\n\"RATATATATATATAAA!\" shrieked a Skaven warrior, unloading a warpstone machine gun at the gromril figure. The glowing rounds tore through the dark, hammering the armor in a deadly storm. For a moment the human's body was shrouded in sparks and smoke, but the runes blazed with blinding light, deflecting every shot, shielding their bearer.\nThe Skaven screeched in triumph—until the weapon shook violently, brimming with energy. The barrels overheated, the warpstone vibrated as if tearing itself apart, and with a metallic roar the gun exploded into a storm of blazing fragments.\nShards of metal and crystal ripped through nearby Skaven, slicing tails, tearing snouts, punching through bellies. Those not killed outright burned in green fire, shrieking and writhing on the ground. The stench of scorched flesh filled the air as the human strode forward through the smoking wreckage, indifferent to the carnage.\nA swarm of rats screeched and fired from side passages, harassing his descent. Rusted muskets, misaligned jezzails, and warpstone pistols coughed green smoke in the dark. But hope was nothing: every weapon crumbled in their claws, barrels bursting with sharp cracks, shards of iron slicing throats and tearing tails. Misfires killed more Skaven than the enemy did.\n\"Die-die, man-thing!\" rasped a Clan Skryre engineer, leaping from a higher gantry. He raised his warpfire thrower, spewing a tide of green flame at the gromril colossus. The infernal torrent licked over the armor and set the human's cloak ablaze. For an instant he staggered back, his silhouette wrapped in fire while the stench of burning cloth choked the air.\nWith a growl, he tore the cloak free and flung it aside. He looked up, eyes burning with fury beneath the helm.\"Ah… son of a bitch. Let's see if you like this.\"\nHe raised his hand. Metal answered. Nails, spikes, splinters, shattered weapon shards shot upward, clinging to the Skaven's body—snout, arms, legs, even tail. The engineer shrieked, thrashing like a trapped insect as the iron bound him tight.\n\"No-no, stop! I serve, obey!\" he squealed, voice cracking.\nThe human closed his fist. The metal began to glow, first red, then white-hot. The stink of burning flesh choked the cavern. The rat screamed and screamed, tearing its own throat raw, writhing as blisters burst open beneath the searing iron.\nAt last, only a charred husk remained, crashing from above to shatter wetly on the stone.\n\"Bastard… lucky I didn't burn… but that thing is devil's work,\" muttered the human, glancing at his arm.\nThere was no rest. A greenish flash lit the tunnel as a spell struck—but the energy unraveled in the air, sucked into the hungry glow of his ring.\nThe human lifted his gaze. Before him stood a Grey Seer, eyes bulging, snout twisted in shock. Both froze for a heartbeat: one in surprise, the other because his spell had vanished.\n\"No-no! Cannot be!\" squealed the Grey Seer, stretching his claws and hurling another incantation. Nothing. Only the eager gleam of the ring devouring every scrap of magic.\nThen came the screams. The Skaven looked to his fingers: the flesh had turned rigid, heavy, golden. His body was becoming solid gold. \"No, no-nooo!\" he rasped, as his arm locked, then his chest, then his legs, every muscle hardening into a cold, gleaming monument. Only his trembling snout remained, drooling in terror.\nThe gromril colossus stepped closer, extending a gauntleted hand of ancient metal. He seized the Grey Seer's skull. The sorcerer's shrieks echoed through the cavern.\n\"This city… is mine.\"\nHe crushed with fury. Bone cracked. Then came the final stroke: the runic mace fell with thunderous force, pulverizing the skull and leaving behind nothing but the Grey Seer's gilded body, a statue of solid gold.\n-----------------------------\ntell me if you like this chapter.",

This wasn't just a handful of rats hiding in the sewers—it was an organized horde: screeching slaves hurled at me like fodder, clan warriors in filthy armor, rats armed with rusted muskets, and worst of all, those thrice-damned warpfire throwers.\n\"Good thing my armor held against that filth… burning to death wasn't on my plans,\" I muttered, eyeing the blackened smear on my vambrace, a reminder of the infernal jet that had nearly caught me.\nI had been fighting for hours without rest. The only reason I still stood was the Dwarf ring on my left hand. I didn't fully understand how it worked, but it gave me unnatural control over the winds of magic: what once demanded rigid discipline and exhausting focus now flowed with a mere gesture. With only twenty minutes of deep sleep, I felt renewed, as if fatigue had no right to claim me. And of course, the jewel repelled hostile magic with brutal efficiency, turning aside spells that would have ended me otherwise. No surprise—it had been forged in the War of the Beard itself, filled with the eternal grudge of the dawi against the elves.\nI descended further and further, each level deeper than the last. The cursed warren of tunnels seemed endless, as if the Skaven had burrowed to the very guts of the world. They had thrown rat ogres at me, beasts whose only joy was breaking bones—but my mace answered better, every strike cracking skulls with a satisfying crunch. I had cut through waves of black-furred assassins, dead before their daggers reached my flesh. The experimental weapons of Clan Skryre's engineers usually exploded in their own hands, bathing them in green fire. Even Grey Seers, horned rats with maddened eyes, had tried to bring me down with their sorcery, but the ring fed on their magic and let me return the favor—melting them under burning metal or turning their limbs into brittle gold before crushing them.\nAnd still, I had not reached the bottom. I had marched for miles, through laboratories, twisted workshops, and underground farms where Skaven slept crammed together like cockroaches. The slaughter had been immense, yet the question lingered: what now? Even if I killed them all, some of this filth would seep to the surface, and they would link it to the events in Marienburg.\nI looked upward, thoughtful. \"I could open a tunnel to the sea and drown them… though with so much erosion, maybe the caverns collapse and bring an earthquake to the city,\" I whispered, weighing options.\n\"Bah, I'll deal with that later,\" I said, standing firm to continue deeper.\nWith a gesture, a dozen ethereal blades spun around me, cutting down slaves in a bloody dance. Some of the Skaven's jury-rigged machines exploded as I twisted them with my will, preventing them from unleashing volleys against me. The labyrinth of tunnels would have lost anyone else, but I could sense the paths ahead, keeping me on the right course into the depths.\nThen I saw it: a vile chamber where amorphous masses writhed in pools of filth. They weren't rats, but lumps of pulsing flesh, deformed spawn fed on greenish fluids that forced them to grow. The stench was unbearable—a mix of rot and sour milk.\n\"Ugh… how in hell can they nurse in this stench?\" I muttered, pressing my arm to my nose.\nA group of Skaven warriors emerged from the shadows, all albino or pale-grey furred. They marched like an elite guard, well-armed, in tight formation. At their head towered a massive leader, a muscular brute snarling with fury, ready to cut off my advance.\nI only had to clench my fist. The metal of their own armor twisted at once, writhing like hungry serpents until it sealed around their skulls and ribs. I heard bones crack, muscles tear, arms and legs bursting. Blood exploded across the survivors, spattering their trembling snouts.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nThey barely had time to react. I raised my hand and the metal from the ruined bodies became razor shards, all aimed at their eyes and mouths. They glowed red-hot before driving into soft flesh, punching through eyelids, palates, and throats. The screams were unbearable, a chorus of pain that shook the tunnel as Skaven clawed at their own faces in a desperate bid to tear out the torment.\nOnly the biggest one, the albino leader, endured. Even with blood streaming from his snout and rage in his red eyes, he lunged at me like a beast. I caught his claws and, turning his own strength against him, dropped backward. Planting both boots in his belly, I hurled him through the air, sending him crashing down the tunnel.\nWe rose at the same time. He held a huge knife, more butcher's cleaver than warrior's blade, and I my runic mace. He snarled, trembling with fury and pain.\"Come on… what are you waiting for? If they die, you're next,\" I taunted, sarcasm in my voice, and it drove him to greater rage.\nHe charged. His cleaver came down with all the weight of his bulk—but I caught it on the head of my mace. The blade shattered in a rain of shards. The Skaven froze, horror plain in his eyes.\nI gave no quarter. I stomped his foot, feeling bones crunch beneath my boot. With my other hand I seized his armor and smashed my forehead into his snout. Blood and teeth flew. I swept his legs out with a sharp move, sending him crashing on his back. Before he could rise, I lifted the mace and brought it down with all my weight on his spine. The crack of his ribs and backbone splitting was so clear it was almost pleasant to hear.\nAs I turned, I realized it was finished. The rest of his warriors lay dead. Some had torn out their own eyes to escape the burning shards I had driven into them, others writhed like scorched dolls, reeking of charred flesh.\nOnly the Skaven females and their caretakers remained, cowering behind those amorphous masses they tried to protect. The stench was so vile it twisted my stomach with nausea. I stepped forward and drove iron stakes through their hearts in an instant. The caretakers died just as quickly—a dagger straight to the chest silenced their cowardly squeals.\nI swept the chamber with my magic. Only a handful of living presences lingered nearby. The entrance stood close, its walls covered in twisted markings—Skaven ritual sigils. Beyond it I found the worst of their horrors: unfinished abominations, hybrids crudely stitched by cruel hands. Horse bodies with rat heads, an ogre split open with organs ripped out, piles of deformed corpses abandoned in pools of bile.\nIn rusted cages huddled beastmen. They did not roar or charge as was their nature. Instead, when I entered, they screamed in raw panic, slamming against the bars, covering their faces with their hands and shrieking like terrified children. Scars and signs of experiments had broken them. They were no longer beasts, only victims stripped of their natural savagery, reduced to trembling shadows by Skaven cruelty.\nAt the back I found what I had come for, though not in the way I expected. One of the elves already lay dead, the other barely breathing, fresh cuts still bleeding.\nIt would have been more convenient if both were corpses. The story stayed cleaner that way, no witnesses. I took one of the Skaven torture knives, smashed the lock of the cell with a blow of my mace, and opened the door.\n\"Tha… thank you… thank you,\" the elf muttered, clinging to my legs with sick desperation.\n\"Yes… don't thank me too soon,\" I answered coldly. The elf lifted his gaze, horror dawning in his eyes just as I drove the blade into his chest, piercing ribs to reach the heart. The light in his eyes dimmed, then vanished completely.\nI could not allow loose ends. No one could know what I had done here. No one would believe it, and I could not risk the truth spreading as an impossible rumor.\nAfter that, I exterminated everything left in the laboratory. Twisted spawn, madly stitched experiments, hybrids of beast and man—all perished under iron and fire. With shards of metal I improvised stretchers to carry the elves' bodies, all while searching for where this warren connected to the Skaven Under-Empire.\nI climbed several levels until I reached an underground rail line stretching farther than my magic could reach. I did not risk flooding it with seawater: a controlled collapse was safer than an earthquake in Marienburg. So I shifted tons of rock and ore for hours, sealing kilometers of tunnel until it looked like a natural cave-in.\nIf anyone came to investigate, they would find only ruins and buried corpses. On this level no one lived to flee, and of the thousands of souls that had crawled beneath the city, only I emerged breathing.\nI gathered the Skaven bodies into a single heap, working for hours. My magic raised a massive sphere of iron to hold them all. Then I incinerated them with molten metal, ensuring not even a necromancer could raise their remains. The reek of burning flesh dominated the air as I covered every body in fire.\nWith the elves secured, I began my return. I crossed the sewers and finally reached the surface. The night greeted me like balm: fresh air, free of the tunnels' rot. I had spent at least a full day fighting without rest. I only hoped my absence had not aroused suspicion.\nI carried the elves to an abandoned house marked for demolition in the harbor's expansion. I hid them under stones and barrels, deep enough they would not be found. Then I returned, making sure the runes of my armor did not shine too brightly, moving in utter silence. I could feel every drop of blood in the area, letting me avoid patrols and guards until I reached Jaan's mansion without trouble.\nI shed the stinking clothes and found the tub left by the previous owner. \"What a fucking day… literally,\" I growled as I heated the water with red-hot scraps of metal. \"Up to my knees in shit… damned rats.\"\nI washed carefully, keeping an eye on the Sigmarite charms in the room—I had no wish to draw the attention of a witch hunter by mishandling magic. Then I cleaned my armor and mace, scraping away the dried blood and foul remains they had endured through the night.\nWhen at last I finished, I dressed in my blue garments and hung my medallion. The Dwarf ring restored my strength swiftly, yet I still gave myself to deep sleep. The next day awaited with meetings with ambassadors… and no one could suspect what had happened in Marienburg's depths.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The witch hunters found the bodies in the tunnels and delivered them at once to the leader of Elftown. To my surprise, the elves were receptive: they demanded the culprits be found, never imagining they were already long dead, buried and ground to dust beneath bubbling iron. Four days after my slaughter in the bowels of Marienburg, it could be said the plague was under control—at least for a few months. All the females had perished, and the thousands of Skaven infesting the tunnels were now ashes.\nWith that resolved, the damned elves would leave me in peace for a while. And I needed it: my schedule was heavy with meetings with ambassadors. Marienburg had regained its position as a great city. The arrival of tens of thousands of workers had restored life to the port, and trade roared once more with its old strength. Merchants from half the world sought to bargain with me, cutting costs and securing profits. Some agreed to commitments such as avoiding foreign labor and hiring only locals, strengthening the economy. These agreements suited me well: certain merchants commanded dozens of barges moving in and out of the port daily, creating steady work for dockers and craftsmen. And as the city prospered, I collected more taxes. I saw no downside—more jobs, more satisfied workers, and higher wages, which I had personally negotiated to win the favor of the common folk.\nOther envoys pressed for fixed tolls to cross the Reik, trying to evade fees based on ship size and cargo. But I was not fooled: what they truly sought was to dodge imperial tariffs on luxury goods. I rejected them at once. To accept would have painted a target on my back, and the Emperor would not forgive such a move.\nIt was then that I met with the ambassador of Barak Varr.\n\"So then, friends of the Empire, allow me to welcome you with open arms to my city. Tell me, how may I be of service to our allies?\" I said with a calculated smile, signaling a servant to bring forth a brimming jug of Bugman's.\n\"Oh…\" murmured the dawi, sniffing the air. \"I see you are a connoisseur of the finest brew in the world.\"\n\"Of course. Who would ignore that the greatest beer ever made comes from dawi hands?\" I replied without hesitation, smile unwavering.\nThe ambassador raised the jug and drained it in a single pull, with the practiced skill of his kind. He slammed the table with a fist and let out a satisfied grunt. \"Ah! Perfect. Just as I remembered.\"\n\"I'm glad to hear it. I've heard King Byrrnoth Grundadrakk wished to establish a treaty,\" I said, leaning forward with interest.\n\"Indeed, noble imperial. Your deeds in support of High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer have reached our people's ears. With the umgi of Marienburg there was always doubt about continuing trade, but you have proven to be a man of trust. Our king believes you can be treated as a true ally. It is his majesty's wish to establish a commercial treaty bringing benefit to both sides.\"\n\"I would be more than delighted to welcome dawi ships in my ports, ambassador. Tell me, what are your king's conditions? I shall see if they are feasible within the authority granted me by the Emperor, chosen of Sigmar,\" I answered with measured courtesy.\nThe dwarf clasped his hands on the table, regarding me with the gravity of one who wastes no words.\n\"My king asks you, noble imperial, that in both Marienburg and Barak Varr no mooring tax be levied. In addition, he requests exemption from duties on the cargo of our vessels, given its obvious utility.\" He gestured toward the window, where the setting sun lit a dawi ironclad moored at the docks. \"It is plain,\" he added with pride, showing the vessel's immensity.\nI rose and walked to the window. There it was, a marvel of Dwarf engineering, a steel behemoth capable of carrying tons of goods. Its chimneys spewed steady columns of smoke, and the entire port seemed dwarfed by its presence.\n\"Indeed… we can negotiate that,\" I said, turning back. \"Would you accept a bilateral treaty? I cannot alter the special duties set by imperial law on certain luxury goods, but the general tax I can set at zero—provided you do the same for our ships.\"\nThe ambassador nodded slowly, satisfied. \"Excellent… only one more matter: how shall we know a ship is truly yours, and not some dishonorable umgi—or worse, an elgi merchant in disguise, seeking to sneak into Barak Varr's ports?\"\nI smiled calmly, inclining my head. \"I will issue trade licenses in the city. Only merchants of trust, or those working under my patronage, will trade under my blessing. I will send complete records to Barak Varr, so you know exactly who is ally and who is impostor. You may do the same—though of course, a dawi merchant will always enjoy a far higher standard of trust than any other.\"\n\"Wise words,\" the ambassador replied, raising his jug in approval. \"We are grateful for such trust, noble imperial. Only one more detail remains that our king wishes to request.\"\n\"Speak,\" I said, in a friendly tone.\n\"As for the construction of a port to work and repair our ships. Special machinery is required, which we would not normally move from our own shipyards. However, in light of your reputation, our king deems it prudent to grant us a port district in Marienburg for such facilities. And alongside them, a residential quarter for the engineers and dawi who will remain here to maintain the vessels.\"\nI stood thoughtful for a moment, letting my eyes drift over the maps and plans spread on the table.\n\"That is feasible,\" I replied at last. \"I have an area that may interest you. Some buildings there are set to be demolished, and we discovered empty caverns beneath that zone. You could use them to raise your workshops and lodgings—quietly, without having to live alongside the… elgi… who dwell in the city.\"\nThe ambassador bared his teeth in a broad smile. \"That would be excellent. Allow us to inspect these caverns to confirm they are suitable.\"\n\"Of course. Give me a moment,\" I replied, raising my hand for more ale to be served. At the same time, I dispatched a group of workers to demolish one of the nearby houses, linking it with the tunnels I had uncovered during my last incursion. I made sure to seal off all connections with the sewers—I would not insult my guests by offering them cloacae disguised as usable ground.\nOnce we had opened the way, I led the ambassador and his retinue to the entrance. The dawi immediately began to inspect everything with a critical eye, examining the walls, the floors—until finally the ambassador caught my attention as we continued walking.\n\"Noble imperial, these caverns are the work of the thagoraki,\" the dwarf ambassador said, drawing me aside from my men to speak privately.\n\"I know… and you may rest assured, honorable ambassador. They are all dead, every last one. I saw to it personally. These tunnels have been cleansed of that filth. But I ask for your silence in this matter. The umgi do not know what the thagoraki are, and if the truth were to spread, the panic would be immense.\"\nThe dawi held my gaze with grave weight. \"I understand… but are you certain? The thagoraki are a formidable foe.\"\n\"You have my word,\" I answered firmly. \"None remain. Their bodies have been destroyed. You will find only empty tunnels and their symbols upon the walls. If you choose to settle here, you will have all my support to populate and fortify the area. Any dawi who take residence will have my resources and protection to ensure no raki ever infest these lands again.\"\nThe ambassador nodded slowly. \"I will take this into consideration. I shall inform my king of your proposal.\"\nWe continued through the passages, lit only by the torches carried by my men. The tunnels were long and winding, their damp walls still bearing the marks of the raki. The dawi inspected everything tirelessly: they touched the stone, murmured among themselves in their tongue, took notes, and examined every sign with expert eyes. My own soldiers looked uneasy, restless beneath the weight of what those galleries had once hidden.\nAfter hours of inspection, we reached the deepest part. The symbols left no doubt that this had been Skaven territory—but they also confirmed that the plague had been eradicated. At last we returned to the surface. The ambassador shook my hand with solemnity and assured me he would present the treaty to his king. He was satisfied with what he had seen, though I made clear that if they preferred, they could also settle in the commercial districts above. Of course, there they would have to share space with the elgi already trading in the port.\nThe dawi left content, carrying with him the draft of the agreement still to be ratified. Having a Dwarf shipyard in Marienburg would be an invaluable improvement. And if I gained enough respect, perhaps one day I could even purchase one of their ships—though no doubt under conditions as strict as those they impose for their crew-trains, which never sail under a foreign banner without the clan's blessing.\nThe visit of Barak Varr's ambassador ended, but I had no time to rest. Next arrived the envoy from Kislev, more insistent than ever to see me. The Kislevites wished to increase their purchases of salt, firearms, and munitions, while offering to sell more animal hides. This time they were not seeking to dump them cheaply as before, but to negotiate a fair price, aligned with the market.\nIt was a difficult offer to refuse. My armies always needed good boots and leather coats to endure long marches. And securing a steady agreement with Kislev meant constant flows of raw materials essential to any campaign.\nOnce the bulk of the administrative work I had been putting off for days was resolved, the time came to prepare for my journey to Altdorf. In my possession I held an invitation from the Grand Theogonist to attend a victory ceremony, and I could delay no longer. My relationship with the Cult had to remain strong: in the Empire, one misstep on that front could mean losing support—or worse, the political machine turning against me. Yet I could not appear as a lapdog. If I gave any image of weakness, they might well demand control of one of my cities under a new prelate.\nWhen all was ready, I boarded my train, accompanied by my griffon—by now transformed into an imposing beast of admirable stature and ferocity, thanks to the diet I had personally secured for him. The animal inspired respect and fear in equal measure, and his very presence reminded all that I did not travel unprotected.\nPassing through Reinsfeld, I made a brief stop to collect some furniture commissioned from the dawi craftsmen of the city. I planned to remain in Altdorf for some time, and preferred certain comforts during my stay. Awaiting me there were several matters of weight: first, discussions with the Cult concerning the ceremony; then, a meeting with the Elector Count of Wissenland about the railway project; and finally, an audience with the Emperor himself.\nMy primary goal was to secure his intercession in negotiating the purchase of the lands of Black Fire Pass. The idea of fortifying that passage had long haunted me: sooner or later it would become the stage of some great tragedy if left unguarded. Yet I knew it would not be easy. I was speaking of acquiring lands held by another Elector Count—and in Imperial politics, nothing stirred more resentment and conflict than altering the boundaries of a noble's influence.\nStill, bribes were always an option—though not large ones. I could not squander everything.\n-----------------------------Follow current novels on NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The only thing I truly need is a yard for my griffon… the rest is unnecessary.\"\nThe seller smiled as one humors a spoiled child. \"My lord, here you have what befits a noble of your station. Space for receptions, room to host hundreds without difficulty. The servant quarters can hold up to six each, and security is assured: the Reiksguard patrols this district constantly. The hot water system works with furnaces your staff may stoke daily. Everything a count requires, you will find here.\"\nI frowned, arms crossed. \"I don't know… we are barely twenty. This is far too much. Don't you have something smaller, with a larger yard?\"\nThe seller raised a brow, surprised.\"That would be outside the walls, my lord. Far from the politics of court… and its security. Your peers would look poorly on it, and you would need to double your guard.\"\nI pressed my lips tight. \"Very well… I suppose you're right. The security of the Reiksguard is not something to dismiss.\"\n\"Excellent. Then let us discuss payment. The property costs ninety thousand gold crowns. The Emperor permits the sum to be delivered after the harvest, if you so wish.\"\n\"Ninety thousand? Are the baths made of gold?\" I exclaimed, eyes wide in disbelief.\n\"Crafted by Dwarf masters, Elector Count,\" he replied proudly. \"The dawi builders' guild oversaw the work. All raised to perfection. Unfortunately, the previous owner failed to meet his taxes and… you know how such stories end.\"Follow current novᴇls on NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n\"No wonder,\" I growled, realizing how damned costly life was near the Imperial Palace.\nI sighed, resigned. \"Fine. I'll pay at once. Send the gold to the Emperor and have the transfer made to my name immediately.\"\nThe man bowed, satisfied at having stripped me of a fortune, and withdrew to handle the documents.\nWhile waiting, I played with my griffon in the garden. The beast nipped at my gromril gauntlets with its beak as I gripped its jaw and moved it up and down. It clawed at me playfully, its talons sliding harmlessly over the metal.\n\"Who's my wicked girl, eh? Who will be my future war machine?\" I whispered, as it clamped down on my hand with its beak.\n\"My lord… I brought the—by Sigmar!\" shouted one of my men as he entered, pulling along a huge pig on a rope. No sooner had he stepped inside than the griffon lunged like a ravenous predator. The soldier leapt back, and the beast ripped into the pig with its talons, plunging its beak into the entrails. The pig's shrieks echoed across the courtyard as blood stained the grass and walls.\n\"That's right… soon you'll do the same to orcs and beastmen,\" I murmured, watching it tear at the flesh with violence.\nMy men only nodded, calm at seeing the creature show no hostility toward them. It was docile with humans—as long as it had fresh meat. Its appetite was insatiable: it needed two pigs a day, though it rarely finished one. If the meat stopped moving, it lost interest quickly.\nThe seller returned with the documents, halting at once at the sight of the blood-soaked garden where my griffon feasted on the still-warm carcass. He tried to mask his horror as he handed me the papers with trembling hands.\nI took the documents and wasted no time sending a group of my men to fetch the gold. The sum came mainly from sales stored at the train station before being transported to the treasury. Gold that, in theory, should have gone to other accounts, but which I could use perfectly well to ensure my griffon had space without being caged.\nIn the end, that fortified estate had what was needed to prevent the disaster that would come if my beast ever broke loose in the middle of Altdorf. It was an obscene expense, yes—but preferable to seeing the city turned into a slaughterhouse because some fool had provoked it.\nThe payment was made by delivering a cart full of chests brimming with gold coins to the seller, who nearly licked his lips with the smile of a man who had just plucked a noble clean. I, meanwhile, prepared for my next duty: the meeting with the Grand Theogonist. I wished to arrive early, in the prime hours of the cathedral, so the reception would be public and well-regarded.\nThe ceremony itself was all pomp and word. I found myself surrounded by priests of Sigmar, hundreds of white-and-gold robes, all watching the Grand Theogonist as he recited praises. I stood still, serene, while my deeds were enumerated: the defeat of a necromancer, the elimination of a greenskin tribe, the aid given to the dawi in the mountains. All adorned with passages from the Cult, telling how, in times of darkness, Sigmar always found a man to purge it. That man, of course, was me in their tale.\nThe climax came when they presented me with a new medallion. They claimed it was blessed by the Grand Theogonist himself, able to detect corrupt magic in any form. They placed it around my neck in solemn silence. I only smiled faintly. If the amulet did not react to me—even in the hands of the most powerful priests—that only meant my control over the winds was such that not even their finest trinkets could betray me. Ironic: they hailed me as Sigmar's champion, not knowing I myself could sense the dhar far more keenly than those baubles ever could.\nThe ceremony ended with a private meeting in the cathedral, with the Grand Theogonist and several arch-lectors. There, the smiles faded and the true interests came forth: temples. They wanted one in every new city of the Westerlands, witch hunter barracks in each major town, and a witch hunter general with a permanent seat in Marienburg to oversee the city.\nI answered as I had before: I could accept cooperation, but not the surrender of control over my lands. The last time, during the purge in Marienburg, I had allowed them to act because the corruption was plain and the pyres necessary. But that had been exceptional. I would not permit such chaos again.\nThe proposal I had put before the Grand Theogonist was accepted, largely because the man was no friend of the most fanatical witch hunters. With that resolved, I was informed that the Cult would send funds to raise temples in the Westerlands, as well as detachments of newly ordained priests and witch hunters to secure the cities against the corruption of Chaos.\nThe meeting ended, and my next step should have been with the Emperor. Yet the audience was impossible at that moment: Kislev had once again struck at Ostermark, looting granaries newly filled after the harvest and leaving entire villages in flames. State troops had died in the defense, and the affair had become an open diplomatic dispute in Altdorf between the Kislevite envoy and the Imperial throne. Tempers ran so high that, for the moment, all other audiences were postponed.\nIn its place, I was invited to one of the Emperor's banquets. I thought to excuse myself, but in truth it suited me to attend: I needed to speak with the dawi, especially the ambassador of Karaz-a-Karak. Black Fire Pass was, after all, ancestral Dwarf land, and any military move there had to have their approval even before negotiations with the Elector Count of Averland.\nI prepared for the occasion with the required formality. I arrived accompanied by a strong escort, a clear sign that I wished not to be disturbed or accosted with frivolities. Even so, dozens of Imperial nobles attempted to approach me, to offer congratulations, flatter my ears, and curry my favor. I ignored most with distant courtesy. My focus was fixed on the group of dawi gathered around a great cask of Bugman's ale. They laughed, drank, and jostled each other, oblivious to the light politics infesting the hall.\n\"Greetings, friends of the Empire,\" I said as I approached. The three turned, fixing their gaze upon me. Their eyes went first to my armor, then to the runic ring and my weapon.\n\"The umgi who aided our people,\" said the ambassador of Karaz-a-Karak, raising his mug. The others did likewise in recognition.\n\"I merely did my duty, honorable allies. But if you would permit me, I would like a few words in private on matters of importance.\"\n\"Of course,\" the three answered almost in unison.\nI lowered my voice slightly. \"I have been considering my next campaign. Next year I plan to march toward Black Fire Pass, to secure the area and cleanse it of the greenskin tribes that infest it. But before doing so, I wish to have the blessing of the dawi. I know well that those mountains are your ancestral domain.\"\nThe other two ambassadors turned their gaze toward the one who spoke directly for the High King. He stroked his beard with solemn gravity before speaking.\"If it is only the campaign you ask, this is easily resolved, umgi. You are a proven ally—you aided in the recovery of a mountain lost to the greenskins. We will not question your intent to cleanse that place.\"\n\"Your generosity astonishes me,\" I replied with a slight bow of the head. \"But there is another request, one that I admit exceeds your authority here. Once the area is cleared, I intend to raise a fortress in the pass—a bastion to prevent future invasions into the Empire. I know that such a project falls squarely within your sphere of influence. That is why I wish to negotiate whatever you deem just, and not take a single step without first speaking with you.\"\nThe ambassador frowned, thoughtful. \"That is more difficult. It exceeds my charge and that of my companions. It would mean ceding influence in lands that belong to our people. Such a matter must be debated, umgi, not only by us, but in the High King's council.\"\n\"Of course,\" I said calmly, meeting his eyes. \"I understand. My intention is only to secure the Empire's southern flank. I will speak of it with the chosen of Sigmar when the chance comes, but I would be grateful if you would carry my proposal to your kings as soon as possible. This fortress would not only be a wall for the Empire, but an advantage for the trade routes of both our peoples. Securing the pass will make future campaigns to reclaim lost karaks more effective, for I can move men faster and in greater numbers to their aid. I ask not that you yield, but that we share the burden of protecting what belongs to us all.\" I said with a smile.\nthey nodded\nI listened as the dawi spoke for nearly two hours about why their ale was superior to anything the umgi could produce. They left no detail unmentioned: from the purity of mountain water, to the slow fermentation in centuries-old barrels, to the selection of grains and herbs that gave body and aroma to the brew. Every explanation came with examples, anecdotes, and comparisons, as if they were teaching a sacred lesson.\nAnd to be honest, I found it far more entertaining to hear that than to endure Imperial nobles demanding gold indirectly, cloaking their pleas in flattery. So I simply nodded and smiled, showing genuine interest in their words.\n\"…then, after the first fermentation, you must let the mixture rest—\" the dawi ambassador was saying, gesturing passionately with his hands—\nBut his words were abruptly cut short.\n\"Elector Count,\" announced a knight of the Reiksguard, bowing. \"Sigmar's chosen demands your presence at once.\"\nSilence fell over the table. The dawi froze with their mugs in midair, staring at me curiously.\n\"If you will excuse me, honorable dawi, another day I shall be fortunate enough to hear why your ale is so much better,\" I said politely, taking my leave.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The echo of our steps mingled with a muffled murmur coming from the Emperor's study. Even with the doors closed, it was clear what was being discussed inside was not pleasant: the muted voices carried anger.\nThe guard opened the doors and gestured for me to enter.\n\"Emperor… I understand you summoned me. Ambassador,\" I said as I entered, bowing my head slightly to the Emperor and glancing at the Kislevite envoy, who was sweating profusely.\n\"Albrecht, only one question.\" The Emperor's voice was grave, cutting. \"Do you think it feasible to teach Kislev a lesson? The ambassador here believes that when I warn of consequences, my word is nothing but provocation. He says it does not warrant action.\"\nI turned toward the Kislevite. \"No need for invasion. Burn Erengrad… no, not even that. Cut off their trade, strangle Erengrad and close the ports, and their economy will collapse in days. Kislev depends on the Imperial fleet to defend its only access to the sea. Without it, they are finished.\"\n\"Curious, isn't it?\" the Emperor murmured, lips tightening. \"They depend on our protection, and yet strike us in the back, raiding entire villages to steal their granaries.\"\n\"Your Imperial Majesty,\" the ambassador broke in, voice cracking, \"this act was not ordered by the Tsar's family. It was a group of boyars who acted on their own. They do not represent Kislev as a whole.\"\n\"We've been chasing this problem for years,\" growled the emperor wearily. \"Either you send me the heads of those boyars... or I'll send someone to collect them myself.\"\n\"Majesty, you must understand that—\" the Kislevite tried to reply.\n\"They used a weapon of Imperial make,\" the Emperor cut him off sharply. \"A weapon that had been delivered only to your royal family as a token of friendship. We have it captured.\"\n\"One of mine?\" I asked, my voice hardening.\n\"Indeed, one of yours. In the hands of those boyars' army. Imagine my surprise upon learning it.\"\nI fixed my gaze on the ambassador. \"You are in serious trouble. I warned you what would happen if any of those weapons were turned against the Empire. And here we are.\"\n\"T-the weapons were gifted to nobles to… to accelerate adaptation, there was no intent—\" the ambassador stammered, nervous.\n\"Albrecht,\" the Emperor interrupted, \"can you ensure all trade with Kislev is blocked in your ports?\"\n\"Of course. I will send a messenger at once. All dealings with Kislev will be canceled, their merchants expelled from the city, and their ambassador forced to leave Marienburg.\"\nThe Kislevite turned even paler. \"Do not make decisions… that harm us all. Remember Kislev is the wall against the northern hordes. A weakened Kislev means they will fall upon your lands.\"\n\"The remedy is simple,\" the Emperor replied, raising a hand toward the door. \"I want the heads of all those responsible. Deliver them, and all will remain as it was. Fail, and forget that the Imperial fleet will defend Erengrad. Forget also that you will trade with us.\"\nThe ambassador bowed clumsily and all but fled, rushing to send an urgent message to his Tsar.\n\"He is gone…\" the Emperor said, glancing at his guards, who confirmed with a nod. He sighed, weary. \"What a damned headache these Kislevites are. Poor harvests, and instead of trading, they choose to plunder granaries.\"\nHe turned toward me. \"Well, where were we… ah yes. I need you to cut trade with Kislev, at least temporarily, so they understand I speak in earnest.\"\n\"I thought we were already speaking in earnest,\" I replied, fists clenched. \"I am furious. We had an agreement, and they broke it. Damn bear-lovers…\"\n\"We cannot strike too hard, Albrecht,\" the Emperor answered gravely. \"What the ambassador said is true. If we weaken Kislev, it will be our frontier that bleeds when the northern incursions come. We cannot afford to destroy them.\"\n\"We can answer in kind. Let me gather a few hundred riders. We will burn their border villages until they learn to keep their cursed promises,\" I said, anger rising.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n\"If you want to do it, do it. I will not stop you… but I will not give you support to do it under the Empire's banner. If you want to torch Kislev's frontier villages, do so—let them learn they cannot strike us whenever a harvest fails.\" The Emperor's voice was dry, his eyes never leaving mine.\n\"Fine…\" I answered, dropping into the chair across from him. \"I had planned to remain in Altdorf… but perhaps my men need training in winter conditions. A campaign in Kislev would be the perfect way to harden them and give them real experience in extreme climates.\"\n\"Do as you wish, Albrecht,\" the Emperor said with a sigh. \"But understand this: if it goes badly, no one will intervene in your favor.\" He gestured with his hand, and the room began to empty. The counselors departed in silence, leaving only a few Reiksguard knights at either side. The Emperor laced his hands over the table and fixed his gaze on me. \"There is something we must discuss in private, in any case.\"\n\"I am all ears, Emperor.\"\n\"We must speak of how to centralize the Empire in the manner you desire… to strengthen it. Until now, I have managed to block the nobles clamoring to divide up the newly taken Bretonnian territories. All want their slice of the pie.\" He spread several maps across the table: fortresses, mountains, mines, forests freshly conquered. \"If I were to divide them carelessly, by tomorrow we would face rebellion.\"\n\"I told your son as much. I thought he would follow the counsel I gave him in my absence.\" I crossed my arms, my expression stern.\n\"Not while you were away. Had we decided with you off fighting in the mountains alongside the dawi, half the electors would have risen in revolt. To impose order in these matters, strength must be shown… and you were not here.\"\n\"Then we must act swiftly.\" I leaned over the map. \"Choose a noble to guard the three ducal fortresses and use the second and third sons of Imperial families to repopulate. That way you draw migration and cover the gaps. Monfort and its gold mines must be secured at once.\"\nThe Emperor nodded slowly. \"The question is who. Do you have someone trustworthy? Whoever takes that post must be loyal to us without hesitation. If he turns against us, we will have lost everything… and angered the electors at the same time.\"\n\"It could be someone from your Reiksguard, your personal champion.\"\n\"Too obvious.\" The Emperor shook his head. \"If I place someone openly loyal to me, all will see it as an attempt to control the Empire outright. We need someone who appears a natural choice, expected, even just… but who, at the same time, owes us everything and has no escape. Do you understand?\"\n\"Joachim von Mackensen,\" I replied after a moment's thought.\n\"The margrave's firstborn…\" The Emperor pressed his thumb to his lower lip.\n\"Exactly. Joachim is loyal to me, and he knows well what happens when he angers me. We trained together many times, and many times he ended with bruised legs from my kicks. We can speak to his father, the margrave. We frighten him, demand he publicly disinherit Joachim, and then we raise him up ourselves as Lord Protector of Bretonnia, with the title of Elector Count. That way we secure another vote, and when he dies… his line will have no claim to direct inheritance. The territory returns to you, and we repeat the process.\"\nThe Emperor narrowed his eyes. \"Do you think he would accept such humiliation? It harms his reputation.\"\n\"Without doubt. The moment we tell him we plan to make his son an Elector Count, he will accept any condition. It will be a stain, yes, but in his line will stand an Elector Count and vast lands under control. His domains will never again be united, and that gives us room to maneuver. The important thing is to secure Wissenland and Averland. Those provinces remain beyond our direct control, yet they produce most of the Empire's food. In a civil war, whoever controls the bread controls the Empire's fate.\"\nI smiled as I clasped my hands. \"And that, Majesty… is what will give us victory. If we control the south, we can contain the most violent electors. They will see that without food and powder they cannot rise in arms, beyond forming a political bloc to resist.\"\nThe Emperor remained thoughtful for a few moments, eyes fixed on the map spread across the table.\n\"And this is the opportunity,\" I continued, \"to bring Ostermark into the fold. If we begin raising Imperial fortresses in the region, garrisoned with soldiers from Reikland, that province will gradually fall into our orbit. We must seize the chance now, while it has no Elector Count, and secure it before anyone claims the title.\"\nThe Emperor exhaled slowly. \"That will be costly. Much gold to raise an army, arm it, equip it, and feed it. Controlling Ostermark is no small task, and it will also win us the enmity of the Elector Count of Ostland.\"\n\"We are bound to quarrel with someone, Majesty.\" I leaned forward. \"But I can contribute. I will pay part of the bribes needed for the electors to accept Joachim's elevation as Elector Count, and I will finance part of the fortress-building in Ostermark. But next year my men will be occupied: I have another enterprise planned.\"\nThe Emperor arched his brows. \"Before your personal ventures, I need you to clear Reikland's forests of beastmen. We cannot postpone it any longer. If we secure those lands, new farms can spread. More crops, more food, more peace for our people. With internal enemies contained, only subversives will remain, and it will be easier to extend our influence into provinces without electors.\"\nI nodded, though not fully conceding. \"My intention is to use my friendship and influence with the dawi for something greater: to gain permission to build a great bastion at Black Fire Pass.\"\nThe Emperor's eyes and mouth opened wide in surprise.\n\"Yes, exactly. A bulwark to block any incursion of greenskins or Chaos into the Empire. It would close all access, save through northern Bretonnia and the east. I could negotiate with the Elector Count of Averland for his support in this project. We will have to drown him in gold, but in doing so we secure the Empire's southern flank.\"\nI paused, measuring my words. \"Moreover, I plan to convince the Cult of Sigmar to contribute men for the garrison. If they feel it is their crusade, they will not hesitate to send priests and witch hunters to guard it. Thus it will not only be a fortress, but a symbol of Sigmar's power… and of a united Empire.\"\n\"Indeed… that sounds promising. But tell me, do you believe it feasible to clear the forests of Reikland by early next year? We must begin moving pieces now.\" The Emperor took up a quill and spread a parchment across the table, dipping the tip into ink. \"I will call the Volkshalle. The electors will debate what you asked, but I will need you to send gold as soon as possible. Whatever you can gather. I will handle bribing enough of them to approve the creation of a new Elector Count.\"\n\"Very well. I will speak with the margrave to secure his acceptance.\" I rose, clasping my hands behind my back. \"But I will need permission to recruit in Altdorf again, Majesty.\"\nThe Emperor looked up, raising a brow. \"For what purpose?\"\n\"If we move swiftly, I can raise several small fortresses in Ostermark. I will see to their armament and garrisons, to secure the frontier against possible Kislevite attacks. I would not dismiss the chance of further raids if their harvest fails again. Moreover, I plan to take the margrave with me on the campaign—forced if need be. When I return, the situation will be in order and the arguments ready to present before the electors.\"\nThe Emperor leaned back in his chair, weighing my words with an inscrutable face. At last he spoke: \"Do it. Recruit around twenty thousand men, no more. Remember we already sent too many to Bretonnia. If you raise more troops than necessary, Altdorf's industry will suffer. There are not as many seeking work as before.\"\n\"It shall be done.\" I inclined with a slight bow. \"I will also look into extending a rail line through Talabecland to Ostermark… though I doubt it will be finished this same year.\"\nI turned and began to leave the chamber. Behind me, I could hear the Emperor writing with resolve, the scratch of quill on parchment sealing in ink the decisions that would soon shake the Empire.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

With that, I could secure food for the day and something more for my family.\n\"Good, Josef, I think we can land another quick job. Some of the Marienburg merchants are still unloading their cargo. If we hurry, we'll earn another day's wage before sundown,\" said Lukas, panting but with a spark of ambition in his eyes.\n\"Let's go,\" I replied, running alongside him through the crowded streets of Altdorf—past the cries of vendors, the smell of salted fish and cheap wine, and the endless traffic of carts.\nIt wasn't long before we noticed something different near the docks. There was a murmur, a swelling anticipation.\n\"What's going on there, Josef? If we take too long, we'll lose the job,\" Lukas protested, but he too stared curiously at a group of knights who had pushed their way through the crowd.\nTheir armor gleamed with pale reflections. They bore a banner: a black eagle spreading its wings, clutching a hammer in its talons, and beneath it, written in letters, the phrase: Sigmar mit uns.\n\"Are they Reiksguard?\" Lukas asked, his voice edged with awe.\n\"I don't know… but we should move aside,\" I answered, though my feet were reluctant. The crowd pressed forward, everyone drawn by the sight.\nA herald in crimson climbed atop a stack of crates to be seen and raised a parchment, his voice booming like thunder above the noise.\n\"Hear me, hear me, people of the great city of Altdorf! By command of Sigmar's chosen, our glorious Emperor and defender of all mankind, Luitpold von Holswig-Schliestein, His Excellency the Prince of Marienburg, Champion of Sigmar, Scourge of Beasts, Bane of Bretonnia, Albrecht von Reinsfeld, Elector Count of the Westerlands, is granted the right to recruit in this city.\nTo all the brave and strong who enlist under his banner shall be given three silver shillings a day! And to those accepted into his ranks, a golden crown as a bonus\nTwenty thousand of the young and vigorous are expected to answer the sacred duty of defending the Empire. Whoever has courage, march without delay to the Altdorf train station and show your loyalty there!\"\nThe crowd erupted with shouts, murmurs, and heated talk.\n\"That's a lot…\" Lukas said, frowning.\n\"Much more than we get breaking our backs hauling crates,\" I replied, feeling temptation sink its hook deep into me.\n\"Isn't that the general who conquered Marienburg and crushed the Bretonnians?\" Lukas asked.\n\"Of course, those are his titles. A few months ago there was a parade in his honor, don't you remember?\" I answered, though my voice sounded more doubtful than I wanted.\n\"Yes… but he wasn't there. That was strange,\" Lukas said, narrowing his eyes.\n\"What do you think? Should we… go?\" I asked, excitement burning in my veins.\n\"I don't know… far from home… dying in campaign…\" Lukas stopped, biting his lip.\n\"They say he's invincible,\" I whispered.\n\"They all are… until someone defeats them,\" Lukas replied. At last he sighed and nodded with resignation. \"Fine, let's go.\"\nWe ran to the station. The place was already overflowing with young men like us—peasants, stablehands, apprentices, even beggars hoping to change their fate. Soldiers in deep blue uniforms kept order with stern discipline, forming lines and guiding recruits into a nearby building.\n\"Those here for recruitment, form up and take off your shoes. Quickly!\" barked a harsh voice.\nWe obeyed. They wet our feet and had us step on white cloth to check the prints, looking for deformities or signs of disease. Then they examined my hands, pressing at the calluses from years of labor. They nodded silently.\n\"Open your mouth,\" another ordered, prying at my teeth with gloved fingers.\n\"All firm and sound,\" he concluded. Then they measured my height. \"One seventy. Within margin.\"\nI was passed on to a soldier writing with quill and parchment.\n\"All right, final questions. Can you read and write?\"\n\"Read… a little,\" I answered hesitantly.\n\"A little? Read this,\" he said, showing me a phrase.\n\"Eh… I swear… by Sigmar… that… I fight…\" I murmured, stumbling.\n\"You can't read,\" he noted swiftly. \"Direct family?\"\n\"My parents, four brothers, and three sisters.\"\n\"Any prior military service?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Any experience with weapons?\"\n\"Only a dagger. For cutting ropes… or defending myself, if need be.\"\n\"Free man or serf?\"\n\"Free.\"\n\"Good. You understand what this means, don't you? You will march far, carry burdens, fight, and swear loyalty to the Prince of Marienburg until the end of the campaign… or your life,\" he said, fixing me with a hard look.\n\"Yes… I know,\" I replied, a knot in my stomach.\n\"Perfect. Enter the building. You're accepted.\" He stamped my sheet firmly and handed it to me.\nI entered. Inside, an imposing statue of Sigmar dominated the hall. A priest in white and gold robes stood before the eagle-and-hammer banner.\n\"Come, son of the Empire. Place your right hand on the banner, your left raised,\" he ordered solemnly.\nI obeyed.\n\"Repeat after me… I swear by the sacred hammer of Sigmar, by the Emperor's crown and by the blood of my parents, that I will serve faithfully my lord, the Prince of Marienburg, as his soldier and servant.\nI promise to guard his lands, defend his people and shed my blood against the beasts, witches and demons that threaten the Empire.\nI will not abandon my post, I will not betray my comrades nor turn my back to the enemy while breath remains in my chest and strength in my arms.\nIf I fail this oath, may Sigmar's hammer strike me down, may my name be erased from the annals of the Empire and may my soul never find rest.\nThus I swear, before Sigmar, before my lord and before the eternal Empire.\"\nThe priest pronounced each word with gravity, his voice resounding through the hall.I, with my right hand firm upon the banner and my left raised high, repeated those words with a knot in my throat.\nAfter repeating the oath, they handed me twenty silver shillings. As I tucked them away, I heard the same words repeated again and again in the hall, each voice more trembling or firmer than the last.\nThen came the equipment. They gave me three uniforms that, at first glance, looked nothing like the everyday clothes of a dockworker or a peasant. They were thick, heavy, and when I touched them they creaked as if hiding plates inside. The first was a kind of dark leather coat; I would swear it had metal sewn into the lining, for when I moved it made a strange echo, though when I set it over my shoulders, I felt an unexpected warmth.\nThe boots were enormous, of hardened leather and lined with wool. So tall they nearly covered my knees, at first it was hard to bend my feet, but they seemed made to withstand mud and snow.\nThey also gave me soft linen underclothes with wool, and a thick cap with a piece that rose to cover my nose. I could hardly breathe with it on; I didn't know if it was meant for the cold or to hide the face. Truth was, wearing it made me feel strange, as if in disguise.\nLastly, they gave me a backpack, heavy even when empty, where I was to keep all my gear: cooking tools, a blanket, some metal pieces and a glass jar containing live yeast, with the warning that we must keep it \"fed\" each day to survive. The army's bread depended on it.\nThe quality was undeniable, true soldier's gear. But for this season it was stifling; the moment I tried it on, I began to sweat.\nWe were dismissed until the next day. With Lukas I returned home, carrying new packs and the metallic weight of coins jingling in our pockets. In one single day I held almost what a whole month of dock work would bring.\nAt home, however, I was not received as I had hoped. My mother broke into tears as soon as I told her about the recruitment. My father, instead, burst into rage. He shouted that nobles never sent their own to glory, but only the poor to die in bloody sieges or as cannon fodder to buy time on the battlefield.\nThe problem was I had already sworn, and I had done so before a priest of Sigmar. Even if I wanted to, I could not retract. So, though I bore the disapproval of my parents, the silver coins I carried ended up in their wooden chest, accepted in uncomfortable silence.\nThat night I could hardly sleep. I tossed in the cot, sweating and thinking about what awaited me. My mother's face, my father's furious words, and the thought of marching far away. In the end, exhaustion took me and I found a brief, restless sleep.\nThe next morning I returned to the station, where I found Lukas.\n\"How did it go for you?\" I asked, hoping to see on his face the same shadow of reproach I carried.\n\"About what?\" he answered, puzzled.\n\"Your parents… mine were furious when they found out.\"\n\"Oh, that… mine were glad, especially my father. He always dreamed of being a soldier, but he stayed a dockworker. He said he was proud of me.\" Lukas shrugged, as if it meant little.\n\"Mine wanted me to take it back, but it was already too late. And of course, he kept all the silver they gave me,\" I said bitterly.\nLukas let out a short laugh: \"Ha, ha, ha. Not surprised at your old man. But what can you do.\"\nWe laughed a bit, though my laugh felt hollow. Then we continued to where a huge group of recruits was gathering.\nThey took us outside the city, to a field where they began distributing firearms: state army muskets, with bayonet and a maintenance kit. They also gave us lumps of hardened wax to plug our ears, something none of us had ever used.The entire day was spent training. One instructor, patient, taught us calmly how to load the weapon, prime it and fire with accuracy. But there was another, far more severe, who didn't hesitate to shout in our faces and strike us with the butt of his staff when we made mistakes.\nThat same day we were taught to pitch tents, dig drainage ditches, prepare rations with the tools we carried in our packs and organize ourselves to sleep in shifts. It was a brutal awakening: from having a mother who set food on the table, to surviving only with what we carried and guarding a glass jar of yeast as if it were a treasure.That jar became almost an obsession. Veteran soldiers warned us that if it spoiled, the whole group would be punished, for without it there would be no bread in campaign. So I kept it at the bottom of my pack, wrapped in cloth, as if I truly carried a relic of Sigmar.\nA week passed in the camp between the shouts of instructors, the smell of powder and the repetitive routine of learning to survive as soldiers. That place grew each day, as if on its own: more tents, more recruits arriving in waves, even makeshift barracks to store weapons and powder. The bustle never ceased.\nThe number of men increased without end. Not only youths from Altdorf and nearby villages: they had also recruited many dwarfs from the city, and more came on trains from who-knows-where—but plenty they were.\nFinally the most dreaded day came: the day of the great march. Horns woke us before dawn, and the damp air was heavy with the smoke of dying campfires and the stench of thousands of nervous bodies. Some twenty thousand men gathered in formation, while officers shouted orders and standards waved in the cold morning breeze.\nThat day was hell. The city fell behind us and we began walking east, toward the borders Kislev threatened to cross. Our packs felt forged of lead: we carried spare uniforms, the musket, powder, ammunition, tools, parts of the company's tents, dry rations and the damned jar of yeast that had to survive as we did.\nWhen Altdorf vanished from sight, my shoulders already burned, my back was stiff and my legs felt chained to stones. It was like being turned into a pack mule, and still we had to keep step with the march. No one said anything, but on every face the same suffering was written: clenched lips and sweat on the brow.\nBy evening, after what seemed an eternity, the order to halt came like divine relief. I dropped the pack to the ground with a groan and my arms hung as if no longer mine.\"Shit, what have I gotten into!\" I gasped, while beginning to raise the tent with Lukas and two other recruits as exhausted as I was.\nThe ground was damp, the stakes refused to sink and the ropes tangled as if mocking us. My hands trembled with fatigue, but we knew if we didn't finish fast the sergeant's fury awaited us. And as if that weren't enough, the task of preparing the bread with the sourdough still remained, guarding that jar as though it were pure gold.\nNight fell over a sea of tents stretching as far as the eye could see. Thousands of campfires began to light.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

One of my uncles served in the state army and he never mentioned marches this long, the kind that tear your legs apart… But look, the sun's going down. Rest must be close.\"\nBut rest never came. The march went on endlessly, until, after what felt like another eternity, the order finally came. The men collapsed onto the damp grass like empty sacks. Some didn't even set up their tents: they just lay where they were, breathing heavily, eyes vacant.\nThat had been our life for over a week. Rise at dawn, eat in haste, march for hours, barely a pause at midday to chew a dry crust, and then walk again until the sun sank behind the forests. A cycle with no end.\nWe had already crossed into Talabecland. The landscape had changed: endless dark forests, narrow paths, and the constant feeling that something lurked among the trees. Only once did we spot a lone beastman, but the Elector Count's veterans didn't hesitate: they leveled their muskets and shot it down before it could flee. The creature fell among the branches and leaves, and the metallic stench of gunpowder mixed with the damp of the forest.\nIt was all pain. My whole body burned: legs, arms, back, neck. There was no remedy but to grit teeth and carry on. The dwarfs marching with us seemed to endure better. They moved more slowly on their short legs, often climbing onto wagons to keep pace, but their endurance put many to shame: they could march full days without complaint, with the same stubbornness they showed when drinking ale.\nFood was the only thing that kept us sane. With the flour we carried we baked bread in portable ovens hauled on supply wagons. To that was added dried meat rationed each day, eggs when luck allowed, and thick soups where fresh beef from cows bought in the villages was thrown. The hot broth, with the strong taste of meat and spices, was almost divine relief. Many said it was the only thing that let them sleep at all, even with legs burning and bodies trembling with exhaustion.\nThe weather worsened with each step. Leaving Altdorf behind, snow began to fall in scattered flakes. Rare in Reikland at that season, but in Talabecland it became more common by the day. The white layer grew beneath our feet, covering roads, trees, and fields. We cursed the march, but blessed the thick clothes we had been given. At least they kept the cold from cutting to the bone.\nWe followed the course of a frozen river, advancing slowly, until we reached the castle of the Elector Count of Talabecland. It was a strange halt: we were made to wait for hours outside while our lord, the Prince of Marienburg, spoke with the local noble. None knew what was being discussed, though rumors spread from mouth to mouth: pacts, routes of march, or simply arrogance between lords.\nAt last the prince returned without explanation, and the column resumed its path toward Talabheim, where we were allowed two days' rest. It was a necessary reprieve: we could sleep better, wash in the frozen river, repair boots and clothes. But even there we weren't spared training. This time we practiced with spears and short swords, simulating basic defenses for when the lines broke. The instructors made it clear: firearms were our main tool, but in war there always came a moment when powder ran out, or the enemy was simply too close.\nThe veterans of the Elector Count, barely five thousand hardened men from past campaigns, would be the first line in any battle. We, the new recruits, were expected to hold the rest.\nIn Talabheim, supplies were bought in staggering amounts. Hundreds of wagons loaded with grain, salted meat, barrels of water, timber for stakes and nails for camp fortifications joined the army's baggage. With them also came merchants, like carrion drawn to the smell of war, setting up along the edges of the column. They sold everything imaginable: thick clothes, trinkets, wineskins of smuggled liquor, even knives and \"blessed\" charms against witchcraft. Many began following us as though they were part of the army itself, always hoping to wring coins from weary and gullible soldiers.\nDiscipline, however, was kept iron-hard. Captains watched day and night, and all of us knew what happened if rules were broken. Every day men were punished, whipped until bleeding before the troops for drinking ale, for secretly hiring women, or for buying extravagant food from merchants. The prince had given a clear order: all would eat the same, from commanders down to the last recruit. Whoever disobeyed would be punished publicly, during the meal, so the lesson sank deep.\nIt didn't matter whether you were son of a peasant or of a burgher—on the march we all received the same rations: bread baked in the portable ovens, dried meat, thick soup with vegetables or with cows slaughtered in the villages we passed through.\nMerchants were tolerated only when the army camped and soldiers were released from duty. But while marching, contact was forbidden.\nSo we advanced on, deeper into Talabecland. The column stretched so far it was lost on the horizon, a river of men, horses, wagons, and powder. From Talabheim onward, a great crowd began following us. Some were families accompanying sons or husbands; others beggars, prostitutes, or trinket-sellers. But most noticeable was the arrival of youths seeking to enlist.\nWinter in Talabecland left many without work, and the army's pay was tempting. Hundreds of peasants and woodcutters joined the march, hoping to be accepted. And what was strange was that the farther we went from the city, the faster they were given uniforms and muskets if they met the requirements. The officers did not waste time: you had to be tall enough to carry a firearm and have sound teeth so you wouldn't lose them biting powder bags. Those who passed were integrated at once, almost without training, and the next day they marched beside us as if they had been there from the start.\nFor many more days we kept marching along the roads of Talabecland, crossing endless forests and frozen fields where the villagers watched us pass. With each day our ranks grew: peasants, craftsmen, stable boys. By the time we left the outskirts of Talabheim behind, the army had gained almost three thousand more recruits, who quickly learned what it meant to serve.\nAfter days of marching, we were finally granted a two-day rest. But it wasn't out of mercy: rumors spread that a great tribe of beastmen had been sighted in the forest, directly on our route. The prince had given the order: we would not leave such vermin at our backs. They would be exterminated.\nThe musketeers were placed in fixed positions, lined up in tight ranks, with wax plugs in our ears to endure the thunder of the volleys. The air was thick with tension, a constant murmur between clenched teeth. The Elector Count's cavalry went into the forest first, scouting. It didn't take long before they came galloping back, and behind them burst the chaos: dozens, perhaps hundreds, of those horned abominations, armed with bone and crudely forged iron, charging with a roar that chilled the blood.\nMy heart pounded so hard I thought it would break my ribs. The ground itself shook under the weight of those creatures, each one a monster of twisted muscle, fangs, and bloodshot eyes. The stench they carried was unbearable.\n\"Fire!\" one of the officers bellowed.\nI aimed with trembling hands, pulled the trigger, and the musket roared against my shoulder. The recoil shook me, the acrid stench of gunpowder filled my nose. I glimpsed bestial bodies collapsing in heaps, torn apart by the opening volley.\nWith clumsy hands I drew the ramrod, bit open the powder charge, and reloaded as best I could. Another group of beasts pushed through on the flank, waving axes and spears. Suddenly I felt a strong hand on my shoulder: one of the veterans shoved me down.\n\"Get down, idiot!\" he shouted.\nI obeyed instantly, reloading crouched while another volley thundered over our heads. The second line fired above us, and I saw another wave of creatures fall, some split in half by the shots, others rolling in the mud, bellowing in pain.\nI was just finishing my reload when a different roar tore through the din. I rose to aim and saw it: a hulking brute emerging from the trees. Nearly three meters tall, with twisted horns and muscles so swollen they seemed to split its skin. It wielded a monstrous sword.\n\"Concentrate fire, first line—fireeee!\"\nThe shots came in a relentless thunder. The entire first line unloaded on the monster, but still it advanced, staggering, taking lead with every step. Its chest became a sieve of bloody wounds, and still it roared like a maddened bull. Only when a final volley tore its face apart did the creature finally collapse, raising a cloud of earth and snow stained red.\n\"Come on, reload, idiots, there are still more!\" one of the officers shouted.\nI repeated the process again and again, doing everything I could to keep from dropping the musket or the ammunition from my trembling hands.\nSeveral times I reloaded and fired, though terror gripped me every time I glimpsed one of those minotaurs. At least they never got close to us.\nAt last we had finished off nearly the entire tribe of beastmen, who began fleeing back into the woods.\nIt didn't take long to realize we had won.\n\"We won… we won!\" Lukas shouted, thrilled at our victory.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\" snapped one of the veterans in charge of us. \"This was just a small skirmish. We don't have time to scour the woods of beastmen. This was nothing—just three minotaurs.\" He glanced over the field littered with corpses.\n\"Only three? We killed those monstrosities with great difficulty,\" I said, stunned by the soldier's indifference.\n\"The Prince of Marienburg can kill one by himself… I once saw him take down three, playing with them. Yes… the man has perfect aim—straight to the eyes, blinds them instantly. This here was nothing, boys. In Middenheim we killed hundreds of thousands in one campaign. But our goal here isn't the beastmen. It's to reach Ostermark and deal with the Kislevites. So pick up your things and get ready—the place is clean, and we march on.\" The veteran bent to help move bodies as he spoke.\nWe didn't take long to burn all the beastmen corpses, enduring the vile stench of their flesh. Then we began marching again toward Ostermark.\nAt least with each day the weight of the pack seemed a little less, but the march never stopped until we reached Bechafen. Finally, after what felt like an eternity in Talabecland, we had arrived at our objective.\nArriving early in the day, we quickly set up camp outside the city while our lord entered to begin negotiations.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

And without any notice of its arrival.\" The chancellor of the Ostermark League, Wolfram Hertwig, glared at me, brow furrowed, his arms rigid against the table.\n\"You requested aid from the Emperor. Here is that aid,\" I replied firmly, meeting his stare. \"The Empire has gathered what it could, as quickly as possible, to defend your eastern border from the Kislevite raiders who have been ravaging your lands.\"\n\"Yes… I understand that.\" Hertwig drew a long breath. \"What I cannot understand is why I was not informed. I could have prepared supplies, housing, some way to coordinate…\"\n\"This was already discussed with the Elector Count of Talabecland, who holds rights over this region.\"\n\"Only in name, nothing more,\" the chancellor shot back bitterly. \"That count hasn't come to levy taxes or raise men here in decades. You know very well he has no power here, and neither does he attempt to exercise it.\"\nI nodded slightly. \"Yes, I am aware. But the truth is, I am here because the Kislevites broke a treaty with me and with the Emperor. They need punishment. Perhaps if they taste some of their own medicine, they will stop plundering us every year under the excuse of poor harvests.\"\nThe chancellor's face hardened. \"I would ask that you refrain from doing anything… rash. You may win a battle, prince, but it will be Ostermark that pays the reprisals. I would prefer you not to attempt it, and instead withdraw your army from my domains.\"\nI leaned forward, letting a cold smile escape. \"The army is here to stay, chancellor. This force will raise fortresses, protect the border with Kislev, and in the coming years, even Ostland if necessary. But since Kislev prefers to plunder Ostermark before Ostland… we shall start here. And remember—it was you who requested aid from the Emperor.\"\n\"I do not have the gold to finance an Imperial army.\" He shook his head, incredulous.\n\"Then it must be found. Because of the constant raids and your petitions for relief, the Elector Count ceded to the Emperor temporary control of Ostermark for its defense. And as the general sent by His Imperial Majesty, Sigmar's chosen, I tell you now: from this moment on you will pay taxes to the Emperor, provide grain and men for the army—until further notice.\"ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ\n\"What?! This is unacceptable. I asked for aid, not to be subjugated in this way.\" The chancellor's voice thundered across the hall, his guards shifting tensely at his sides.\n\"Ah…\" I nodded, rising slowly from my chair. \"Then summon the members of the League. All of them must contribute a special levy, hand over part of this year's harvest, and provide recruits for the army. Furthermore, I demand that every man who by law owes service to the Imperial army be mobilized at once. This is not a suggestion, it is an order.\" I walked toward one of the narrow windows, from where the city lay beneath the grey winter sky.\n\"No!\" Hertwig roared, slamming the table. \"I demand you leave my domains at once. I will take this matter to the Emperor. Until then—\"\n\"This will happen, chancellor,\" I cut him off, turning slowly back toward him. My hand rested on the haft of my runic mace. \"If I leave this city without control of Ostermark, I will march with my eighty cannons and twenty-eight thousand men. I will tear your walls to rubble, massacre every last inhabitant, and send a clear message to the rest of the League: this is what becomes of traitors to the Empire. Because that is exactly what you are committing right now, chancellor: high treason, by disobeying a direct order of the Emperor.\"\nHertwig's guards had their hands on their swords.Mine were quicker. They drew their runeblades, making them sing through the air with a metallic hiss. That sound alone froze the chancellor's men where they stood.\n\"So then, chancellor… what will it be?\" I asked with a crooked smile, lifting my other hand to my helmet. \"Do you wish to keep your head on your shoulders, or shall I help you with the problem of it being too hard to understand that this is not the time for resistance?\"\n\"You… you…\" the chancellor muttered, cursing under his breath.\n\"Yes, yes, curse me all you like,\" I interrupted calmly. \"But I want all members of the League here, in Bechafen, by next month. And this is not a request.\"\nThe League's leader covered his face with a hand, shaking his head, defeated.\n\"Good. Now that we know who commands here, let us speak of what matters. I need to know where the Kislevites crossed the river, and where they struck hardest.\"\nThe chancellor sighed, resigned. \"Through The Veldt. It is the most fertile part of Ostermark. Endless plains, without hills, renowned for their abundant harvests. Whenever they overpower the river garrisons—funded by some of the League's nobles—the Kislevites always strike there.\"\n\"I see… then they crossed from the east.\" I frowned and extended my hand. \"I assume you have maps. It would be strange if you did not.\"\nThe chancellor snapped his fingers and his men moved quickly. They soon returned with scrolls of parchment bearing the League's maps, showing castles, villages, and towns. Ostermark, seen thus, looked like a broken mosaic: thick forests, endless hills, tiny hamlets. The Veldt, however, was a sea of plains, where small villages of less than two thousand souls produced most of the grain that fed the cities. Protected only by two riverside fortresses that barely covered the expanse. That was my point of operations.\n\"Perfect. I already know where to move the army. I will leave a garrison of one thousand men in the city. The rest will march with me to defend the farmlands of The Veldt. And in addition…\" I smiled as I studied the maps. \"I will take with me every man who, by law, owes service to the state army. We will conduct a short levy. The Emperor expects this year's taxes to be paid directly to me. I will await payment—from you and from the rest of the League. Any delay will be considered treason. Remind your peers not to make me bring my army to collect in person.\"\nI left the chamber slowly, the smile still on my face as I glanced at the chancellor's twisted expression. His rage was palpable, but useless.\nBechafen called itself a city, though it barely held ten thousand souls. The term was generous. It was easy to threaten a place like that when your army outnumbered its entire population three to one. The true strength of Ostermark lay in its smaller towns—villages of up to two thousand inhabitants, ringing the city like concentric circles.\nThat very day I conscripted another thousand men, pulling them directly from the state army's ranks to weaken them so they would not dare consider resistance. I had to subdue Ostermark, break the League, and place them firmly under Imperial authority.\nKeeping an army that size was no cheap endeavor. Food, wages, winter gear, weapons, horses, fortifications—it all cost a fortune. I knew the nobles would resist, would hate every coin they were forced to surrender. But that was my task: to break them. To force them to understand they could no longer rely on their local alliances, that only the Emperor and his general could provide security.\nSo, as we marched south along the river's course, passing through two smaller towns, the progress was swifter than expected. I needed little debate: showing the chancellor of Bechafen's seal was enough to redirect all the nobles' fury onto him. I demanded men, food, and payment of taxes to the Emperor without leaving space for argument.\nWe recruited another thousand men along the way. I had to leave behind a stable force of thirty thousand soldiers, preferably drawn from Ostermark itself, so they would defend their own land when I departed for Averland. I had much work ahead.\nI divided part of my troops, sending my captains with smaller detachments to continue conscription and collect taxes directly from the nobles, always under Bechafen's authority. That way, when the time came for the League's assembly, all their resentment would fall on the chancellor, not me.\nAs for myself, I would maintain the pay of the twenty-five thousand men already enlisted. They would be the ones to accompany me into Averland. The other twenty-eight thousand, if possible, would be raised exclusively in Ostermark, bound to its defense.\nWhen we finally found a point to cross, we reached The Veldt. As expected for the season, the villages were deep in their winter routine: little activity in the streets, families enclosed in their homes, working on crafts to keep occupied and warm. The lack of garrisons was obvious. That was why Ostermark was plundered again and again: full granaries and defenseless peasants.\nThe closer we drew to the river marking the border with Kislev, the more refugees we encountered. Whole families fleeing burned-out villages, taken in by neighboring communities that shared what little they had. If anything could be said of Ostermarkers, it was that they knew how to cooperate with each other; there was none of the selfishness common in other provinces, where every family thought only of its own bread.\nIt was in these hundreds of villages that we recruited thousands. Some enlisted simply for work during the winter; others for vengeance, eager to strike back at the raiders. Unlike my regular troops, these men were paid less, for they technically became part of the Imperial army rather than my personal forces. Yet all received weapons and proper equipment from the supplies I had brought for the campaign.\nIn total, we added some five thousand more men during the march through the countryside. But the grim reality of the conflict soon revealed itself: we left behind untouched villages and entered a zone of pure devastation. Houses reduced to ashes, fields burned, granaries empty. The trail left by the Kislevites in their raid.\nIt did not take long to reach our destination. In one of the easternmost stretches of Ostermark lay a place where two rivers descended from the mountains, forming naturally defensible ground, a gift of geography. There I decided to establish our base.\nI immediately set the whole army to work, though it was the dawi who made the true difference. I had brought with me a mix of Duran's workers and warriors who had promised their aid in settling my grievance with Kislev. As soon as they received the order, their picks and shovels bit into the earth frozen hard by winter. The soil was like stone, yet their runic tools carved through it with ease. Within hours they had reached the bedrock and prepared the ground to raise a permanent fortress, while my men set up a palisade and the temporary camp.\nI spread my veterans along the river in watch posts. I knew the deeper the winter grew, the more likely it was the Kislevites would attempt to raid The Veldt's fertile lands. Three hundred League men were never enough to withstand northern cavalry; my troops were.\nIn the days that followed, reinforcements arrived: entire companies of recruits and convoys laden with supplies. My men returned from their tax-gathering expeditions with sacks heavy with gold and with thousands of peasants conscripted. The threat that disobedience would be treated as treason had worked: all paid. None of the League's nobles wished to risk a personal visit from my army.\nThe force assembled now stood at forty-two thousand men. Of course, most were green soldiers, hastily conscripted and without experience. I had no intention of using them in my offensive campaigns, save for minor duties or garrison work. For what I planned—burning a Kislevite castle here and there, leaving scars to remind the Tzar what happens when he toys with the Empire—I would rely only on my personal forces.\nMeanwhile, the supply lines held strong. With the current recruitment, I knew we would reach the goal of thirty thousand men settled in Ostermark before year's end. That would be my legacy there: a local army, maintained with their own gold, forced to recognize the Emperor's authority and dependent on our weapons to survive the next winter.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Behind me, hundreds of shots rang out at once. The echo split the frozen air, and with it dozens of riders and horses crashed into the snow, painting it with a thin layer of blood.\nI raised my runic mace, glowing with a fierce aura, and drew another pistol from my holsters. The Kislevite riders began to topple from their mounts, trapped among the bodies of their own comrades. Their horses neighed wildly, unable to leap over the growing mountain of corpses before them.\nI fired again. This time the shot shattered the face of another warrior, who fell backward like a sack of stones.\nThe formation of Kislevite lancers had lost all momentum. They tried to regroup, but their vanguard was annihilated, and the river had become their grave. I tossed the pistol into the snow and raised my mace for the final clash.\nHorse against horse, steel against runed steel. The impact was brutal, sharp, and the battle turned swift and bloody. I struck with all my strength against the torso of a boyar who had managed to cross the river. I felt his armor and bones break like rotten bars under the weight of my weapon. The man collapsed into the snow, lifeless, while the Kislevites began to retreat, fleeing like rats after losing hundreds without even breaking our line.\n\"Take prisoners! They'll serve us later in negotiations,\" I ordered. My men dismounted to drag the wounded riders out, trapped beneath dead horses or entangled among their comrades' corpses.\nI watched as dozens of Kislevites were hauled to our side of the river, while the rest lay buried little by little beneath the constant snow.\n\"My lord, the priest of Morr has arrived for the rites,\" one of my captains reported.\"Let him begin. The rest, with me. We're crossing the river. It's time they learned what happens when they meddle with the Empire.\"\nWhile the infantry cleansed the battlefield, ensuring the dead received Morr's rites so their souls would not feed demons or necromancers, I pushed my troops forward. We crossed over the improvised bridge the Kislevites had built for their raids. Their own work now became the path to their punishment.\nOur destination was Polotsk, a town of commercial importance in the region, though not especially fortified. We rode fast, following the trail of the retreating Kislevites. At my back, fifteen hundred riders: a mix of my elite guard in runic armor and my men-at-arms, wielding swords, axes, and Dawi-forged warhammers, though without the same protection.\nThe charge into the town was unstoppable. There was barely any resistance. We entered through the main streets, our horses trampling those who dared stand in the way. The Kislevites scattered in panic toward the fortified tower, the only refuge worthy of being called a defense.\n\"That wasn't too hard,\" one of my men said, panting, his breath turning to vapor in the frozen air.\n\"They're used to finding no resistance. The League doesn't defend the frontier, only their own houses. The nobles hide behind walls, leaving the villages to suffer alone. No wonder they flee at the first clash.\"\n\"What now, my lord?\" asked a rider, eyeing the crowd pushing into the tower.\n\"Burn it all. We don't care for the loot—it will be scarce anyway. But let them die of cold and hunger… that is the message we'll send. Nothing must remain that they can call home. The food stores they worked so hard to gather will go up in smoke.\" I spurred my horse forward.\n\"Yes, my lord!\" came the chorus of replies.\nTorches flew onto roofs, houses, and stables. At first the fire spread slowly, checked by the snow, but soon the dry materials caught, and flames roared to life. The town blazed, lighting the night with an infernal glow.\nWe found one of the main granaries—stuffed with grain. We emptied it immediately into our carts before setting it aflame. Little by little, Polotsk was consumed down to its foundations. Only the stone structures blackened by heat remained, along with the fortified tower crammed with soldiers and civilians alike.Thɪs N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nAs I watched the flames devour Polotsk, I wasted no time. I spurred my horse on in search of more villages to reduce to ashes. The next victim of our wrath was Vitebsk, a nearby settlement. The story repeated itself: we stormed through blood and fire, cut down the warriors who dared resist, stole their horses, and set every building ablaze. Even inns and stables burned without mercy. When we left, Vitebsk was nothing but blackened stone husks and smoke.\nWith two towns reduced to ashes, we began our return to safer ground. Our carts were heavy with grain, dried meat, and other foodstuffs seized from the Kislevites. With luck, those supplies would feed our army for another week, perhaps two.\nOn arrival, I saw the progress of the dawi. They had dug vast quantities of frozen earth and were already laying the foundations of what would become the largest fortress in the region.\nWe had won the first battle of many, but I knew danger did not only come from the Kislevite riders. The local nobles were growing increasingly uneasy. They had lost the autonomy Talabecland once allowed them, and now they saw an Imperial general imposing the Emperor's authority in flesh and steel. That was the greater problem. The question was no longer if they would resist, but to whom the troops would remain loyal: to their natural lords, or to me.\nThat is why, in recent days, I reinforced vigilance. Groups of my men controlled the roads and the communication posts of Ostermark's nobles, watching for any suspicious move. All I needed was for them to make a mistake: a plot, a betrayal, a gesture of defiance. Then I would have the perfect excuse to accuse them formally, strip them of everything, and assume absolute authority.\nFor now, I had to keep appearances and move within Imperial law. I had done nothing outside the rules—only enforced them with greater strength and no tolerance.\nMeanwhile, I deployed constant patrols. My recruits moved through the villages of Ostermark, ensuring that the frontier remained guarded. They cleared forests of bandits and hunted down raiders, sending a clear message to the peasantry: their villages were safe because the Empire—through me—was willing to defend them. If I could make the common folk see my soldiers as their protectors, it would not matter how much the nobles growled. The loyalty I sought would be mine.\nEach passing day I made sure my forces moved from village to village. The constant military presence made recruitment easier: patrols often returned with new volunteers, men who swore the oath on the spot and joined the marches and basic drills. The army grew with each passing day.\nBut the news about Ostermark's nobles and their correspondence troubled me. The messages they sent and received were multiplying, so I gave the order to intercept and capture messengers. In the Empire it was not unusual for one or two letter-carriers to disappear; no one would suspect much. I needed to know what they were plotting.\nWhile waiting for results, I decided to punish Kislev once more. Recently we had stopped their attempt to build another bridge across the river; their workers were shot dead before finishing it. I could not let the chance for retaliation slip away.\nI gathered my riders and bought riverboats at a ridiculous price. On a frozen night we crossed in total silence, ignoring the cold that bit down to the bone. We sailed to a nearby forest and, guided only by the moon, advanced toward Rakhov, a trading town of great value to Kislev. Goods of high worth passed through there, and it was not far from the capital.\nThe woods shielded us until the last moment. Only when we reached the first houses did I see the flicker of torches in the guards' hands. Everything seemed still, asleep, silent.\n\"A large town… there will be plenty to plunder for us,\" muttered one of my riders.\n\"Forget the castle. Bringing cannons here would've been impossible. Burn it all, and quickly,\" I replied, pushing my horse forward.\nWe got closer than we should have. Suddenly, I noticed the guards shifting uneasily. They had sensed something. Our cloak of night was torn.\n\"For Sigmar and for the Eternal Empire!\" I roared, spurring my horse and raising the runic mace high.\n\"For Sigmar!\" my men shouted in chorus, charging with me toward the gates of the town. The guards fled inward, with no time to organize.\nWe crushed the first defenders in the streets. Three fell beneath my mace, their bodies smashed against the frozen snow. Soon we were inside, fighting house to house, street by street. Thousands awoke in terror, caught in the chaos of fire and blood.\nThat was when I felt it. At the end of a street, in the darkness, a spark of magic flared like an invisible bonfire. Only my arcane senses could detect it. The energy swelled rapidly.I spurred my horse, shoving aside defenders with crushing blows that left pools of blood in my wake, driving straight at the sorceress.\nI saw her. Barefoot in the snow, hands raised, fingers surrounded by a frozen glow. Colossal shards of ice materialized around her, and with a gesture, she hurled them at me.My runic ring blazed so intensely the entire street shone like daylight. The ice projectiles disintegrated midair, turning to vapor under the rune's power, drawing cries of astonishment from Kislevites and my own men alike.\nI galloped hard, breaking through the line of defenders who tried to bar my way. The sorceress turned at the sight of me and began to run.\"Coward!\" I roared, raising my mace as the ring pulsed with blinding light.\nI charged with fury, ready to crush her skull. She hurled herself into the snow, dodging by mere inches as my runic blow shattered the ground where her head had been. I spurred my horse forward and drove the beast into her. The animal bowled her over, then its hooves trampled her again and again. Skulls and ribs gave way under the pounding until her head burst in a spray of blood and ice. The Kislevites nearby froze, stunned. Then, like terrified rats, they broke and fled in every direction. The death of their witch had sealed their defeat.\nThe town's resistance collapsed within minutes. With the mage dead, nothing remained to hold the defenders' morale. My men, armed with runed steel, tore through every street and makeshift barricade.\nTorches flew, and soon Rakhov was engulfed in fire. People ran in desperation, escaping into the frozen woods, where winter would finish what my soldiers had begun. From the fortified tower, the local boyar and his guards watched helplessly, their eyes burning with hatred as they saw their town consumed. I did not bother with forcing the gates open with magic or storming the keep. Burning the entire settlement was victory enough: sooner or later, that boyar would crawl to his Tzar to beg for food and aid.\nAmong the prisoners captured was a priest—yet, to my surprise, not of Ursun, but of Ulric. In a coarse dialect he told me the latest news: Tzar Vladimir had recently died in a campaign against goblins, and Prince Boris had vanished, later found in dreadful health. Kislev was mired in succession chaos, and to worsen matters, the cults of Ulric and Taal held more influence in the region than I would have ever expected.\nI chose to leave the local temple intact as a gesture. Burning everything else was my plan, but letting that priest keep preaching was a way to sow further discord among the Kislevites.\nAfter this, we withdrew back into Ostermark. The raid had been swift and brutal, but I could not linger longer than necessary. Among the intercepted messengers of recent weeks, one carried a particularly interesting letter: a plan by the nobles of Ostermark to try and expel my garrison from Bechafen.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

As soon as they appear, we surround them… and have a very polite talk with them,\" I replied calmly, watching the snow-covered road as the flakes piled up on my armor.\nThe wind blew harshly, biting into the bones even under the armor, and time seemed to stretch on endlessly. At last, we saw what we had been waiting for: a column of knights and infantry marching toward Bechafen.\n\"We've got them where we want them. Don't fire yet. We outnumber them; they shouldn't even try to resist… unless they're very stupid,\" I said as my men rose from the snow, throwing off their white cloaks and stepping out from the woods.\nIn an instant, we blocked the road. My cavalry closed the way in front and behind, and thousands of musketeers deployed on either side raised their weapons, forming long firing lines aimed directly at the nobles' column.\n\"Well, well… quite the noble escort, heavily armed too, from the looks of it. Almost as if you were heading to defend the Kislevite border… though the border isn't toward Bechafen, is it?\" I said with a smile, as my troops secured the ambush.\nThe men began glancing at one another, uncertain.\n\"All right, let's make it simple,\" I continued. \"I know what you're planning. And that is treason. I carry the Emperor's mandate for every action I've taken, and I have proof that your intent was to expel Imperial forces from this province. Surrender, and I will spare your lives.\"\nThe soldiers looked at each other, wavering. Slowly, they began to throw their swords into the snow, ignoring the desperate cries of the nobles ordering them to stand firm.\nI gave a signal with my hand, and my men moved into formation, stripping the surrendered soldiers of their weapons. The knights too began to drop their lances and swords, surrendering one after another. Only the most desperate tried to flee; their horses were shot down and the nobles captured immediately.\n\"Margrave Gotthold Schurz… and Margrave Richard Dornier, of Essen and Heffengen,\" I said, recognizing the banners of two of Ostermark's most powerful houses.\nThe nobles remained silent, their faces twisted with rage.\n\"From the looks of you, you've run out of words. So tell me: what made you do something as foolish as rebelling against the Empire?\"\nOne of the margraves, his voice thick with anger, snapped back: \"Do you really need to ask? For decades we've fought to shake off the yoke of Talabecland. We've paid taxes and sent men only for them to profit, while here we received nothing. Years of resistance, and then you arrive… and destroy everything we achieved.\"\n\"Destroy it?\" I replied, my voice as hard as ice. \"I bring you an Imperial army nearing fifty thousand men. I bring safe roads, protected fields, a border secured against the Kislevites. Soon enough I'll sweep the greenskins from your forests as well, and Ostermark will be safer than it has ever been. And instead of supporting me, you try to undermine what we've built.\"\nAnother margrave muttered bitterly: \"But you undo everything we fought for…\"\n\"Then you'll have to adapt,\" I shot back, glaring at them. \"If you like it, fine. If you don't, I don't care. From now on, there will be a permanent Imperial army in Ostermark. And it will be funded by Ostermark through its taxes. You're getting everything you claimed to want: security, a shield against Kislev and the beasts. All you have to do is pay the price. Gold, arms, and powder in exchange for your lives. That is the new reality.\"\n\"What shall we do with them?\" asked Joachim, watching the captured nobles.\n\"We need them alive. I can't afford to earn the hatred of all the nobility by executing every traitor. Confiscating their wealth and lands will be enough… their titles will remain, at least for now,\" I replied calmly, though the decision had been made long before.\nMy men escorted the prisoners toward the fortress under construction. There they would serve as forced garrison, or at worst, as labor for the works the dawi oversaw with their rune-etched picks. A humiliating life for a noble, but useful for the Empire.\nThe margraves who had led the failed attempt at rebellion marched in chains beside me, while fifteen thousand of my men accompanied me back to Bechafen. The chancellor must have felt very secure in his chambers, ignorant that his plan had collapsed before it even began.\nThe gates of the city opened at my approach. My troops already controlled the local garrison, which we soon turned into prisoners as well. Their loyalty was compromised, and I could not trust them to guard the villages of the rear. At the front, against the enemies of the Empire, they would serve better.\nI entered the chancellor's residence without resistance. I found him in his chamber, his gaze lost, like a man who already understood the end of his game.\n\"So… this was your brilliant plan?\" I said, advancing slowly. \"A hasty rebellion, with the sole idea of expelling my garrison from Bechafen? Is that all you could muster? I gave you time to prepare something more competent… and this is what you bring me.\" My tone carried more disappointment than fury.\nThe young chancellor lifted his eyes, weary. \"We don't have many soldiers. Ever since the damned Knights abandoned us against the greenskins, our defenses collapsed. The little gold available went to maintaining the League's fortresses.\"\n\"Yes, I noticed. I expected a much larger noble host… but six thousand men are nothing. Not even with Bechafen could you reach ten thousand. Did you really think ten thousand poorly armed peasants could stand against my fifty thousand?\" I shook my head, almost amused at his naivety.\n\"I thought… that if I could retake my city, I might cut off your supply lines. I believed desertions and a rising of my people would force you to retreat and negotiate. But it seems I couldn't even achieve that,\" he admitted bitterly. \"What will happen now?\"\nI crossed my arms. \"I have no intention of killing you. But there will be a complete restructuring of the local nobility and landholdings. The power of the great margraves is finished. Their estates will be broken apart and handed to lesser nobles, mere administrators of the Emperor. That way, their offices can be revoked at any time.\"\nThe chancellor blinked, startled. \"But… wasn't this meant to be temporary? What happens when Talabecland reclaims its rights?\"\nI smiled sideways. \"Nothing is more permanent than the temporary. The letter says 'temporary control.' For how long? Ten years? A thousand? Ten thousand? It was never specified. That was the trap. As long as Ostermark remains in a state of emergency, the Emperor can rule these lands as absolute lord. That was the agreement.\"\n\"So… if I had done nothing, would you have just left quietly?\" asked the chancellor, bitterness dripping from his voice.\n\"Yes,\" I replied coldly. \"I would have left you bound to the Imperial general of the garrison, watched, subordinated, controlled. But now… now I can do whatever changes I want. Reduce your power, strip you of the city, and do it all using the same Imperial law you swore to obey. I will expropriate almost everything, though I will leave a few lesser nobles standing so the local nobility does not panic. The rest… will serve the Emperor. And me.\"ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nThe chancellor collapsed into his chair, defeated, his eyes vacant like a man who had realized too late the full reach of his mistake.\n\"When you're done lamenting, leave this castle. It's no longer yours. Is that clear?\" I said with a sneer, while Joachim and I left the chamber.\n\"So what do we do now?\" asked the young man, the future Elector Count, walking at my side with a frown.\n\"For the moment, reorganize everything. Send forces to every corner of Ostermark, remove the League's garrisons and replace them with our troops. The administration must merge into a single body: taxes and recruitment under one hand. Before we leave, there must be thirty thousand permanent soldiers here, well-equipped and maintained by these lands. With that, Ostermark will be secured for the Emperor: a vast stretch of land and tens of thousands of souls serving his armies.\"\nJoachim nodded, but replied cautiously: \"That's the general idea… but what should I do, concretely, when the time comes? If one day I must decide in your absence.\"\nI looked at him sharply as we descended the corridors of the castle, now taken by my men. \"Delegating is an art, Joachim. You cannot blindly trust the common folk: they are fickle, impressionable, ignorant. You will always need the nobles, even if we have just punished them. They are the only group with education, with networks of influence, with the respect of the peasant. Use them.\"\nJoachim listened intently, and I continued: \"Make sure the land is worked in an orderly fashion. Irrigation canals, windbreaks of trees, grain warehouses. Create a stable recruitment system, capable of feeding the army we've left here consistently. And most important: an administrative apparatus that collects taxes efficiently. Watch corruption like a hawk: gold that vanishes into the wrong pockets is one less army for the Empire.\"\n\"I understand…\" said Joachim, nodding at my words.\n\"About your father, tell him to take charge of Bechafen temporarily. It seems he does not enjoy being much at the front receiving orders, and for now we will not stay here long. We already have what we wanted; now it is only a matter of seeing how the region evolves once we've laid stronger foundations for the central governance of the Empire,\" I answered.\nAs we sent patrols to all corners of Ostermark to reorganize the province, I received grim news: the new Tzar was gathering an army in front of our fortress, and everything suggested he intended to attack.\nAt such a warning I was forced to act quickly, concentrating all available men in the area. What the devil was he thinking… if he hoped to consolidate his reign with a swift victory, he would not find it against me. So I left several dawi of Duran to continue organizing the system in my name and marched immediately to the fortress, determined to greet the new Tzar with a defense worthy of the situation.\nI arrived in two days, after a forced march. It was evident this was going to be a major battle. I immediately began preparing my griffon, which in recent weeks had already accepted a saddle on its back. The beast had grown to an imposing size, far greater than a simple demi-gryph, and I thought it was time to test it in battle against Kislev.\nThe fortress was still under construction: the dawi worked tirelessly, hammering stone upon stone, raising walls, opening spaces for cannon emplacements, and drawing defensive lines that used the course of the rivers. On the far side of the stream, however, Kislevite forces could be clearly seen gathering.\nThey did not have the numbers, not even close, but they had something dangerous: an abundance of mages, many of those ice-witches who could complicate any battle. Their army was composed mostly of green recruits, even less experienced than mine, though among them a handful stood out, better equipped with armor and weapons more serious than mere spears or bows.\nMeanwhile, my army continued to gather. With the patrol forces, the troops of nobles forced to cooperate, and my personal veterans, we outnumbered them perhaps three to one. By my calculations, their numbers were around eighteen thousand men, a poor showing for what I expected of a kingdom like Kislev.\nOn one of those days, at the only bridge still standing, the Kislevites requested an audience. I was not about to deny them. I approached riding my griffon, its wings spread wide, and on the other side appeared a warrior mounted on a massive war-bear.\nCrossing the bridge, I could confirm what I had already seen from afar: a poorly trained, poorly equipped army. Even at such a crucial moment, their lack of discipline was blatant. Soldiers chatted among themselves instead of staying alert, some looked nervously to the sides, and others, incredibly, had left their weapons stuck in the snow, as if waiting for it all to end on its own.\nThey were not the force one would expect of the new Tzar. It looked more like a hasty levy than a real army. It was evident that, with a little pressure, their formation would shatter like frozen glass under a hammer.\nThe idea settled clearly in my mind victory here was feasible, and if I could rid myself of those cursed ice-witches, the rest of the army would collapse inevitably. After that… nothing would stop us from marching on Kislev. All it would take was to impose enough terror and spill just enough blood to then place a puppet on the throne or tear up large chunks of land... or establish the cult of Sigmar as the official religion.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

He wore ceremonial lamellar armor adorned with the wings of a winged hussar on his back. At his belt hung a curved scimitar, and his eyes fixed on me with a hard frown.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar,\" I said in Russian, making the sign of the twin-tailed comet, while my free hand stroked the neck of my griffon. The beast stared intently at the bear, instinct ready to lunge at it at any moment.\n\"Imperial General,\" my counterpart replied curtly, without averting his gaze.\n\"I hear you seek to negotiate with me. With whom do I have the honor?\" I asked, keeping my calm.\n\"Boris Bokha, Tzar of Kislev. I want to know why our ally, the Empire, has decided to attack us.\"\n\"Ally? … Ally?\" I repeated, narrowing my eyes with sarcasm. \"From what I understand, an ally does not cross borders every year to steal harvests and burn villages. That is not an alliance, that is an enemy.\"\n\"Those acts were committed by…\" he began.\n\"Don't come to me with excuses,\" I cut him off sharply. \"We have confirmation from your own ambassador in Altdorf. Imperial firearms, handed directly to the Bokha family, turned up in the hands of the boyars who attacked Ostermark. That raid was done with Kislev's complicity, whether you admit it or not. And when we demanded a diplomatic resolution, what did we receive? More attacks.\"\n\"Those acts were carried out by rebellious boyars who still believe Imperial lands are their ancestral right to feed from. Under my rule this will no longer be tolerated. That is why I ask you to cease military actions and let the rest be resolved by diplomats,\" the Tzar answered firmly.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"The negotiations will be now, Tzar of Kislev,\" I replied coldly. \"Because now you see what happens when you anger the Empire. In front of you stand sixty thousand Imperial soldiers ready to fight, an army worth millions of crowns. And the Empire is still waiting. Waiting for the heads of every boyar responsible for the attack.\"\nMy griffon let out a deep growl that rumbled across the bridge. The bear, unsettled, huffed and rose on its hind legs before settling back to the ground. Boris Bokha did not take his eyes off me.\n\"I have not yet had the time to conduct a proper investigation,\" he said more calmly.\n\"Ah… and this magically solves everything, doesn't it? The peasants killed themselves, the villages burned themselves,\" I said, my irritation plain.\n\"I believe this should be handled through diplomats, since I doubt you have the means to accept Kislev's conditions,\" the Tzar said firmly.\n\"You may convince the Emperor to end hostilities, Tzar, but that will not resolve my grievance with the Bokha family. I had the word of your daughter and your ambassador that none of my weapons would be used against the Empire. And look what happened: my honor dragged through the mud, my reputation ruined. You may have peace with the Emperor, but that does not mean my army will retreat. The Emperor has not spent a single coin on this force; it is entirely under my control. So let the ambassadors handle matters of state—now it is time to settle matters between us,\" I said, locking eyes with him.\n\"You accuse me of failing to control my men, yet here you do the same?\" the Tzar shot back.\n\"Yes, only that we have a grievance against the honor of my family. So I want to hear how you intend to repair that damage… or I will find out by force,\" I answered harshly.\nThe Tzar breathed deeply, exhaling a heavy cloud of steam into the frozen air, his eyes never leaving mine.\n\"Kislev is willing to pay to compensate your grievance,\" he said at last.\n\"Good… I like to hear that. I want the heads of all the boyars involved in the use of my weapons during the raids on Ostermark, and I want all the expenses of my army reimbursed to me immediately,\" I demanded without hesitation.\n\"The boyars… I can try. I need a few days for that. As for the gold… I need to know how much we are speaking of. Kislev's coffers are not in the best condition, with Imperial trade cut off,\" the Tzar answered with evident discomfort.\n\"I have spent around two million crowns keeping my armies mobilized and half a million more in supplies. So I suppose five million, for the inconvenience of having to bring my grievance to the gates of Kislev, is fair,\" I said calmly.\nMy words made the Tzar's eyes widen.\n\"That… that is too much… I don't think it possible to sustain that level of expense personally,\" the Tzar stammered.\n\"You forget that I am lord and master of Marienburg, the largest and most prosperous market in the Empire, through which the goods of every nation in the world pass. I have gold to spare… more than enough to continue financing this campaign. I could easily raise another army of this size. So send me the gold swiftly, and I will consider my grievance settled,\" I replied, unconcerned.\n\"I understand, general, only it is impossible for Kislev to pay that sum. It would completely drain the reserves the late Tzar left for our campaigns against Chaos and the northerners. If we deplete them, Kislev's turmoil will never end,\" the Tzar said heavily.\n\"And failure to pay will mean I wait for summer, when your witches are weaker, and then I will burn Kislev to ashes… and I will consider my grievance settled,\" I replied icily.\n\"I think negotiations, for the moment, will bear no fruit. I would prefer we continue them later,\" the Tzar said, letting out another thick cloud of frozen breath.\n\"Fine… suits me. Just remember that even with peace with the Emperor, it will not mean Marienburg's ports will reopen,\" I answered, turning the reins and riding back toward Ostermark.\nFor several days we simply watched one another from afar, locked in a war of stares, doing little more than waiting as the snow worsened each day. Time was on our side: Kislev's harvests were still poor, and now they could no longer raid Ostermark. With spring's arrival, sooner or later I would have to draw my sword… and I would not sheathe it again without blood being spilled.\nMeanwhile, an Imperial envoy arrived riding hard into Ostermark: the Emperor's ambassador, sent to negotiate a peace treaty with the Tzar.\n\"So then, Prince of Marienburg, what do you hope to gain from this treaty of peace?\" asked the ambassador nervously, wiping his frost-covered brow with a frozen handkerchief.\n\"Let them pay me back what I spent on this campaign. And let those damned boyars who shoved my warnings where the sun doesn't shine have their heads properly cut off,\" I said as I paced inside my tent, watching my griffon slowly devour a freshly slaughtered cow.\n\"Yes, prince… but the amount of gold you're asking for is too much. That sum could buy the loyalty of entire armies of mercenaries. It's not something that can be secured easily,\" said the ambassador, turning pale as the griffon tore chunks of meat with a wet crunch.\n\"I spent around two million outfitting this army and on the construction materials for the fortresses. And nearly half a million more in supplies to maintain it these past months. It's a fair compensation for all I invested,\" I replied, fixing my eyes on him.\n\"Yes, but… but… that would leave Kislev very weak,\" the ambassador murmured, almost trembling.\n\"Then let them finally focus on defending the north instead of looting the Empire. Remind them there is no more trade with Marienburg: their merchants are banned from my ports, and anyone who tries to deal with them will be too,\" I answered as I dropped into a chair and stroked the feathers of my griffon, still stained with fresh blood.\n\"It's difficult… difficult…\" the ambassador said, lowering his voice.\n\"Then make them pay in installments. Let them send gold every month, but I want the full amount of what I spent. Demand they hand over someone from their family as a hostage, whatever it takes. I cannot let this grievance go unsettled,\" I said harshly.\n\"You shouldn't… worry about what the nobles of—\" the ambassador began, but I cut him off, raising my voice.\n\"I care more for the ground beneath my boots than for what the nobles of Altdorf think. My Dawi friends are what matters to me. And I will not let my grievance go unpaid. A promise was broken, and that is paid with gold… or with blood,\" I replied, my voice rising until the echo carried beyond the tent.\n\"Ah… right… the noble Dawi . That complicates things. But I think I'll be able to find a solution, something to close this matter. My question is… do you want to participate directly in the negotiation?\" asked the ambassador, almost hoping I would say no.\n\"No. I might end up trading blows with that Tzar. Just seeing him in front of me already made me want to split his skull. And I doubt I could kill him before all his ice witches leapt at me. I've no interest in playing his game,\" I replied, folding my arms.\n\"I see…\" he said with relief. \"It's a real shame you don't want to take part in these negotiations. Your prestige as a commander could certainly make them consider your demands. But I understand you don't wish to be part of this embassy,\" he added in a diplomatic tone.\n\"Get out already… I know you don't want me to come anyway,\" I answered as I began eating some soup, still hot despite the cold.\n\"I'll try to secure something that will be a fair treaty,\" said the ambassador before leaving.\nThe ambassador departed, leaving me alone with my soup.\n\"Ummm… this turned out well,\" I muttered as I kept savoring it slowly.\nI waited for several hours, watching from afar the campaign tent pitched near the river, where guards from both sides glared at each other while the negotiations dragged on.\nThe ambassador returned by nightfall, but he brought no final news. He told me no agreement had been reached, and the talks would continue the next day.\nThe next day it was the same story again: long discussions, no resolution.\nFinally, on the third day there seemed to be luck. The ambassador returned escorted by my guards, looking pleased, and behind him several Kislevites were dragged in bound, shoved toward our side.\n\"Well then… what was finally agreed?\" I asked with a smile, eyeing the scrolls the ambassador carried under his arm, protecting them like treasures.\n\"Well, well… we have what the Emperor wanted, and what you wanted too. All these are the culprits still alive, the ones who used Imperial weapons against the Empire. On that point we have an absolute victory. They will be executed in Altdorf,\" said the ambassador.\n\"I want some of them executed in Bechafen and in the villages of Ostermark. They have more right than anyone to see these bastards beheaded. I want them hanging from the ruins of the villages they burned, as a reminder. Let them stay there a few days… then Morr will claim them,\" I answered coldly.\n\"Oh… well… the Emperor… yes, of course. Consider it done, general. We'll hand over half of the prisoners so you can execute them at your discretion,\" the ambassador replied, swallowing hard.\n\"Excellent… they will pay dearly for their audacity,\" I said with a dark smile.\n\"Yes… I'm glad you're satisfied with that part of the negotiation,\" the ambassador replied, starting to sweat.\n\"Yes… and now… how much gold are they going to pay me?\" I asked suspiciously, noticing his face change as he avoided meeting my eyes.\n\"Ah, yes… your new father-in-law wants to meet you and discuss that,\" the ambassador blurted, before spinning on his heel and trying to flee in a hurry.\n\"My what!?\" I shouted as I watched him run, scroll still tucked under his arm.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Who do you think you are, using my marriage for your political schemes?\" I roared, chasing after the ambassador as he ran like a hare, seeking the safety of his guards.\n\"Don't blame the messenger, I only follow orders!\" squealed the ambassador, finally shielding himself behind a wall of steel: the Reiksguard knights lowered their lances, forming a barrier between us.\n\"And who gave the damned order? Speak now, or I'll cut off your head right here!\" I bellowed, shoving three Reiksguard knights out of my way.\n\"The Chosen of Sigmar…\" the ambassador replied in a trembling voice, stepping back at the sight of my fury.\n\"Luitpold? …Luitpold? I give him my loyalty, and this is how he repays me… that dog…\" I muttered through clenched teeth, gripping the handle of my runic mace tightly.\n\"Kislev… Kislev agreed to recognize the Imperial cults within its pantheon, granting them tolerance… in exchange for military support from the Empire. Support you can provide—filling your coffers with gold, selling weapons… The Cult of Sigmar gains a new seat, the Emperor secures the eastern frontier… everyone wins,\" stammered the ambassador, sweating cold.\n\"Yes, everyone but me… Now it turns out I've been married off to who knows who, and I'm the one left with the problem,\" I snapped back.\n\"To Princess Katarin, heir to the Tzar… A marriage that secures the union between the Empire and Kislev,\" said the ambassador in a trembling voice.\n\"I don't believe the Emperor would do something this insane… Just thinking of the implications makes my head ache. Do you realize what this means? They've married Sigmar's Champion to a mage! …A mage! Do you have any idea the chaos that will erupt in Altdorf once the Grand Theogonist learns of what has just happened here?\" I said furiously, stomping my boot on the ground.\n\"The Grand Theogonist is not a man bound by the fanatical doctrines of the clergy… he accepts the mages,\" murmured the ambassador, trying to sound convincing while hiding behind the Reiksguard's armor.\n\"And what about inheritance? I have no heir. Will the Westerlands join Kislev, or Kislev the Empire? Or do they intend to turn all this into a political circus, with my blood as currency?\" I replied, now more thoughtful about the problems this Imperial move would bring me.\n\"That will be resolved later… one of your mistresses, or… all of them, could help legitimize some of the fruits of your adventures, prince,\" the ambassador dared to suggest.\nMy eye nearly started twitching with rage. \"Do I look like the kind of man who has mistresses? Do you think I have damned time to chase skirts when I have campaigns to lead and an Empire to hold on my shoulders?\" I replied in a tone so harsh that several of the Reiksguard knights swallowed nervously.\n\"M-my apologies, prince… I assumed wrongly,\" stammered the ambassador, still cowering behind the Reiksguard armor.\n\"Watch your step, fool… or you may find yourself lost in the forests of Talabecland,\" I said, stepping closer, only for the Reiksguard knights to try to hold me back.\n\"Get your damned hands off me,\" I growled, shoving them aside.\n\"The Tzar Boris requested that you come to discuss the marriage matters when you are able, prince,\" said the ambassador nervously.\n\"Ah… great idea. Just when I'm itching to kill someone,\" I muttered, striding toward the Kislevite camp tent to see if I could sort out this mess.\nI crossed the bridge slowly, followed by several of my guards who shielded me from the hostile stares of the Kislevites stationed at the riverbank. The air was heavy, as if every breath turned into frost.\nThe Tzar's guards let me through without much issue. Inside the tent I saw him seated in his chair, surrounded by priests clad in white furs and ice witches radiating a palpable cold. And there she was: his daughter, Princess Katarin, gazing at me with glacial eyes that seemed to pierce flesh and touch bone.\n\"Your shouting could be heard all the way here,\" said Tzar Boris with a faint smile, his deep voice rumbling like distant thunder.\n\"Very funny… Now tell me, what is all this about marriage?\" I asked, fixing my gaze on him.\n\"Strange… many nobles would kill for a moment alone with my daughter, and you receive the privilege of marrying her. Yet you seem displeased with the honor bestowed upon you,\" said Boris, turning his head slightly toward Katarin, who kept her cold, imperturbable expression.\n\"I had no interest in this. My only intent was to fulfill my patriotic duty to the Empire: to strengthen the frontier and devote myself to destroying its enemies. Marriage was not in my plans… not for years, perhaps decades,\" I replied with clear irritation.\n\"Yes, I could see it in your eyes,\" Boris said with a rough laugh. \"You are a hot-blooded warrior. We probably would have beaten each other to death had we kept talking on that bridge. Ha, ha, ha… But Kislev needs the Empire, and the Empire needs Kislev. You shut down all trade, even in times of peace. That I could not accept. So the Emperor Luitpold's proposal pleased me… even my dear daughter recommended this union.\"\n\"You realize we are both knee-deep in trouble now… I am recognized by the Cult of Sigmar as their Champion… and I've just been married to… forgive me if I offend… a mage. The cult will hound me for this, and I dare not imagine what will happen to you and Ursun now that you've agreed to tolerate Imperial cults… especially the matter of inheritance,\" I said more calmly now, taking a seat.\n\"I know,\" Boris growled, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. \"But I'd rather pay you the gold I owe in smaller monthly installments than all at once. Kislev has too many projects pending: we need men, weapons, training. And you can provide all of that…\"\n\"Good.\" I sighed heavily. \"That takes the weight off my shoulders. The grievance is settled.\"\n\"Wait… you're more concerned about the grievance than the gold?\" Katarin spoke for the first time, her cold voice raising an eyebrow ever so slightly.\n\"Of course,\" I replied calmly. \"I am dawongi of a Dawi clan, and I have many ties with Karaz Ankor. Do you think they'd take kindly to me letting an offense slide? That would have doomed my relations with the Dawi… And trust me, the Dawi give the finest gifts in the world to those who aid them.\"\n\"Well… interesting,\" said the princess, showing the faintest smile for the first time, though her eyes remained like ice.\n\"Well,\" Boris resumed, slamming his gloved hand hard against the wooden table. \"The most important thing to calm both sides of the nobility is that we reach an agreement on inheritance as soon as possible. Quite simple: you must have at least two children. One will inherit the Imperial territories, the other Kislev. And since you are married, neither of you will be heir to the other. That way we avoid problems on both sides. The boyars and atamans will kick and scream, they'll refuse furiously… but it's the only way. And I am certain this will bring prosperity to Kislev.\"\n\"What a headache this is going to be… Why couldn't you just pay?\" I said, shaking my head.\n\"If I had done that, Erengrad would have died with your decision to close the trade. Kislev would have died slowly,\" replied Katarina, her gaze piercing me as if judging every word.\n\"Yes, that was the general idea…\" I nodded with irony. \"Well then, I have to… let's see: campaign in Reikland for the first two months, campaign in Black Fire Pass in the third and fourth months, perhaps extending into a fifth…\" I paused for a few seconds, counting mentally. \"I'd be open to a joint offensive against the Norscans or the northern tribes. The following year I'll be occupied marching and marching, so I'll have to decide whether to head to Middenheim to clear its forests of beastmen… or whether we can plan a joint campaign.\"\nI looked at him firmly, waiting for his reaction.\n\"Well… you were right,\" said the Tzar, glancing at his daughter. \"He's colder-minded than he appears. I'm surprised: before you threatened to burn Kislev to ashes, and now you speak of planning joint campaigns?\"\n\"We're already stuck in the biggest mess of our lives… do you want to add bad blood between us on top of it? I think a rope and a tree would be faster,\" I replied with sarcasm, crossing my arms.\n\"Ha… we'll get along,\" Boris growled, showing his teeth in something like a smile. \"I'd like us to first try to reclaim some defensible areas of Kislev that are infested with mutants, before going after the Norscans.\"\n\"Pff… the problem is time. Traveling back and forth will take weeks. I have a treaty with the Elector Count of Talabecland to build a railway line toward Ostermark. If you sells me the land, I could extend it into Kislev, even to Praag, and with that move troops quickly. Though that would require keeping the area very secure. For the next year, don't count on me—I'll make sure the railway line is secured by clearing the forests,\" I answered thoughtfully.\n\"Given the situation, land in those areas is very expensive… Imperial prince,\" Katarin intervened, her icy eyes fixed on me.\n\"Exactly, farmland of great value. And whoever controls it, controls much of Kislev,\" added Boris gravely.\n\"Ah… so that's the angle. As it happens, Imperial firearms have gone up in price quite a lot… especially since someone used them all to arm his army. So I'm afraid they'll be sold very dearly,\" I replied with a half-smile.\n\"A little stingy, considering we're family now,\" the Tzar laughed, though his gaze remained hard. \"But fine, about another matter… I need instructors for my armies. And according to the Emperor's ambassador, your men are very disciplined and well-trained.\"\n\"The best in the Empire, without a doubt. The problem is language. I believe I am the only one, or among the few, who speaks Kislevite fluently. So it will be difficult for them to serve as instructors… unless you use translators. Still, I suppose we can work something out for firearms training,\" I replied.\n\"Good, then… who will be able to stay?\" asked the Tzar, leaning toward me.\n\"I'll ask among my men who would be interested in working here. But you'll have to pay them well out of your own pocket,\" I answered, thoughtful.\n\"If necessary, I will. You've already noticed that…\" began the Tzar.\n\"That your men were shameful, yes. I would have crushed them easily if not for your witches,\" I interrupted him dryly.\n\"Very observant…\" Boris growled. \"The ice witches are the Motherland's greatest defense. It's good that you know to respect their power. My daughter is one of the most powerful of her circle, and even in her youth she surpasses many of her teachers. Be careful what you do.\"\n\"What? I'm not afraid of your witches, Tzar. In fact, I already had a plan to kill them easily,\" I replied harshly.\n\"Oh really? And how would that be? I'm interested to hear such arrogance,\" Katarin said, narrowing her eyes and fixing her gaze on me.\n\"Cast a spell on me, please,\" I said, extending my arms. \"Whichever you want. Try to kill me.\"\nKatarin looked at her father with doubt, and the two exchanged a puzzled gesture. Then she agreed and conjured a small shard of ice, hurling it at me immediately. The magic dissolved in the air, absorbed by my runic ring, which began to glow.\n\"Ah… Dawi runecraft,\" I murmured, watching as the princess summoned larger fragments of ice.\nI remained motionless. All the magic was absorbed by the ring, though this time I felt a faint chill.\n\"I've never seen such a powerful arcane artifact,\" she said, astonished.\n\"Runic… the proper term is runic,\" I corrected calmly. \"It's from the War of the Beard, one of the most powerful objects against Elven magic. So it's no surprise you failed. That means my idea of launching a frontal attack with my griffon against the witches would have worked.\"\n\"Stop thinking about fighting. We're allies in this now, and we'll have to work together,\" Boris said firmly.\n\"Yes, there are many benefits to be gained,\" I replied, though my mind was already wandering to what businesses I could open in these lands.\n\"Katarin will return to the Empire as an ambassador, with a strong escort. I expect you to weigh the reprisals of the Cult of Sigmar against her. In the Empire she'll be safer, at least for now,\" said the Tzar.\nI nodded silently. At the end of that short conversation, I returned to my men, accompanied by a large escort of ice witches and palace guards.\n-----------------------------Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

At least this grievance was finally settled, and I could tell the dawi that my honor was intact, that the blood of the guilty would soon be spilled before the villages of Ostermark.\nI had wanted to leave behind a strong Imperial frontier, and though it might not mean much in the long run if Tzar Boris kept his word about no more raids in Ostermark or Ostland, the thirty thousand local men would be good enough to deal with the necromancers to the south and the greenskins to the east. It had not been a total loss. With that permanent army and the economic foundations I left under Imperial administration, Ostermark would be able to sustain troops, even increase its levies over the years, ensuring that the border remained well-defended.\nBut now my new headache was this cursed marriage.\nIt was obvious: I had walked into a snare I had tied myself by giving the ambassador full negotiating power without any limits. Kislev had secured my industrial capacity to supply their army, and at the same time, by becoming family, I could no longer deny them access to my ports without causing a scandal. They'd cut me off right there. Yet it was also an opportunity: if I played my cards right, I could use Kislev as a source of cheap resources for my industries. As family to the Tzar, I should be able to buy anything without restrictions, and with railways to transport goods, the exchange of raw materials for weapons and processed supplies would be immense. That would allow me to expand my industry without relying so heavily on other provinces of the Empire. Kislev could offer me everything I needed.\nThe real problem was the Cult of Sigmar. Not only had I married a mage—already scandal enough—but a follower of Ursun. The Grand Theogonist could very well strip me of the title of Champion of Sigmar.\nUnless I found a tale grand enough to justify it before reaching the capital. I needed something that would not only restore support but secure the Cult's total confidence. The answer was clear: if I found Ghal Maraz. That had always been my goal with the campaign in Black Fire Pass, but now it made perfect sense. I could return to Altdorf with Sigmar's hammer in my hands, returning it to the rightful heir of the Empire. With that, no one would dare question my role, though I would make Luitpold pay dearly for this marriage trick.\nWhen I looked up, I found Katarin's eyes. Since she had entered my tent, she had not stopped watching me, in complete silence, just like her witches and the guards surrounding her. All silent, all expectant. It was a heavy silence, as if they were weighing each one of my movements.\nBut before I could decide how to break the ice, the ambassador entered again, followed by several members of the Reiksguard, watching attentively as though expecting me to try and kill him at any moment.\n\"Can we talk now that I see you a bit calmer?\" the ambassador asked cautiously.\n\"And what exactly do we need to talk about now?\" I answered with open annoyance.\n\"In private, Prince of the Empire,\" the ambassador said, and so we did. We went into a tent guarded by many Reiksguard, a place where he seemed to feel much safer.\n\"Well… well… the matter is very simple, Prince. From what I see, you already get along with your betrothed. Only one thing remains: the Emperor needs you to publicly say that this marriage was entirely your idea,\" the ambassador said, his voice nervous as he spoke.\n\"Ah… so you marry me off without asking, and on top of that I'm supposed to give thanks?\" I replied, rage simmering under my tone.\n\"You granted me the power to negotiate in your name to resolve the matter with Kislev, and it was in the Emperor's interest that trade between both nations resume. If you had kept your decision to close it, it would have weakened the shield against northern incursions, and that could not be allowed. The marriage served the Emperor's interest and at the same time reopened Kislev's trade,\" explained the ambassador, his voice tightening more with every word.\n\"You know you've put the Emperor in serious trouble, don't you? If I now say I was forced into this, he'll turn into the new Dieter IV, when all the Electors turn on him for trying to cut their autonomy,\" I said coldly, fixing my eyes on him.\n\"That won't be necessary… General of the Empire, you are a loyal servant of the Emperor. He himself said you would understand, and that you would try to resolve it diplomatically to prevent the Empire from imploding in civil war… all over an event that clearly benefits you, especially when your dynasty will also rule over Kislev,\" the ambassador answered, sweating.\n\"Yes, I am loyal… but I'm no lapdog that obeys blindly. The least you could have done was consult me. Now it's different, ambassador. I expect the Emperor to be ready to pay very dearly for what he's done here today,\" I said, my voice ice-cold.\n\"What is it you want? The gold for the grievance? The Emperor could raise it, if that is what you deem fitting,\" the ambassador replied.\n\"I don't care for that gold—it will end up being the peasants' money for bread. What I'll demand is something else. Tell the Chosen of Sigmar he had better be ready, because it won't come cheap if he doesn't want me to cause a scandal in the middle of Altdorf,\" I said, angry, arms folded.\n\"General, this is serious. It must be resolved quickly. The Empire must endure, and this event will strengthen it greatly. You only have to say you accepted, and the Empire will be stronger than ever. Our Emperor will have the safest borders since the Empire's founding. Almost every entrance is already guarded by fortresses… and now we have Kislev as an ally in the north,\" the ambassador said, his tone striving for firmness, though fear seeped through his words.\n\"Yes, me used as a political pawn… though I am willing to cooperate for a strong Empire, you don't make it easy, damn them. How could they do such a thing and expect me to accept it just like that? Spare me the mockery… just tell the Emperor to prepare himself, because it won't come cheap,\" I said, rising from my chair and glaring at the nervous ambassador.\n\"Idiots,\" I muttered as I walked through the camp, noticing the dawi already celebrating the victory, drinking their ale as if there were no tomorrow.\nThe news that my grievance had been settled had spread quickly. The guilty were in our hands, and the dawi were euphoric. For them, these ceremonies were sacred: when a grudge was resolved, the ale had to flow like rivers. My men looked on with envy, so I relaxed the discipline for once and let them spend their pay on the merchants lingering nearby, until now without luck in their trade. It was payday, and after months of abstinence, the soldiers threw themselves eagerly into ale, food, and gambling with the dwarfs. As expected, they always lost; no human could outdrink a dawi.\nThe celebrations soon began, turning my men's iron discipline into a festival. I, however, returned slowly to my tent.\nInside, the atmosphere was as cold as ever.\n\"I know you're of the fashion of loving the cold, but at least you could stop staring at me as if you were about to kill me,\" I said, glancing at Katarin's escort, who remained fixed on me like statues.\n\"What happened in the end?\" asked the princess of Kislev.\n\"About what?\" I replied.\n\"About what you discussed with the Imperial ambassador,\" she asked, her eyes still locked on mine.\n\"About how to explain the marriage to the Grand Theogonist. He won't be pleased, that's for sure. But it's too late now to complain openly about what will happen. We need to return to Altdorf as soon as possible. Next year there's a meeting with the Elector Counts, and that will be the time to speak with the Grand Theogonist to prevent you and your witches from being burned at the stake for practicing without a license inside the Empire,\" I said while reaching for a quill to begin writing.\n\"I have only one more question for you. What will happen to the army? Will it return to protect Ostermark? Father is worried, he does not want a bellicose neighbor seeking revenge now that we are weakened,\" said the princess.\n\"The Emperor plans to place here the general who took part in Monfort. He's a good commander in the field, though terrible with nobles. But that won't be a problem here: there are no nobles, only soldiers who will obey. So the army will remain under Imperial orders for now. The only one who wanted to burn Kislev to settle a grievance was me,\" I answered, not stopping my writing.\n\"Interesting to know that,\" Katarin said, then fell silent again.\nI wrote for hours, selecting the local nobles who would be temporarily named as governors of the towns and cities of Ostermark. It was necessary that the province be organized: that local taxes be used to maintain garrisons, repair walls, and finance the thirty-thousand-man army that would remain as a permanent force.\nIf the Kislevites did not stir trouble again, Ostermark would have to look to other fronts: greenskins in the eastern mountains or necromancers in the south. Both were growing threats. No one in the Empire wanted to spend a fortune cleansing those lands, leaving them to Stirland's neglect. But if we wanted a strong frontier, fortresses would have to be built at the mountain's foot and defenses prepared against the corruption creeping forward day by day.\nAccording to the latest report, the railway through Talabecland was progressing well: it had already reached Talabheim and soon would extend to Ostermark and Bechafen. That would finally ensure the swift movement of troops from west to east across the Empire, with little trouble. The north–south route was still missing, but in due time. With the costs of building towns, cities, irrigation canals, woodlands, and farmland, the dawi gold I had gained from the campaign was being spent far faster than I had calculated. As much as I wished to hasten these works, it was impossible to keep so many men on pay at once.Follow current novᴇls on NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nI had to keep the dawi workers from Duran and a group of my own men, who oversaw the railway's expansion with the help of the Elector Count's troops.\n\"My lord, I bring you your princess's supper,\" said one of my men, entering with a cow tied by a rope.\n\"Is this a joke? She's your betrothed, that's no way to treat her!\" exclaimed one of Katarin's guards, bristling.\n\"He doesn't mean her, Princess… food,\" I said, turning my head and pointing to my griffon. The beast slept quietly, buried under a mound of furs. My voice woke it, and at once it rose, feathers bristling, eyes blazing.\nThe griffon let out a thunderous shriek. The cow, seized by panic, tried to break free, but was quickly brought down and torn apart. Its screams mixed with the crunch of bones and the wet tearing of flesh as blood stained the snow and ground.\n\"She is my princess…\" I murmured, watching my griffon rip into its prey, scattering entrails across the floor.\nI turned to Katarin and her guards. \"Are you hungry? You've been here all day, and I haven't seen you eat a bite,\" I asked politely.\nKatarin held my gaze and, with a solemn nod, answered, \"We will accept whatever your men provide us.\"\n\"Oh… bad news, my dear betrothed… I have no servants. I do everything myself. So if you were used to the good life, surrounded by maids and attendants, I'm afraid that's over,\" I said with a faint smile, standing up.\nThe griffon kept feeding, tearing warm chunks of flesh from the cow, while I prepared to cook something simple. I was hungry, and the sight of the beast ripping apart a whole carcass only reminded me more of it.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

There would be much debate over possible candidates, as many would try to push a noble that suited their interests to become the new Elector Count of the Bretonnian March.\nSo, with the matter of Kislev concluded, the Imperial general soon arrived, and I handed over to him command of the army I had left in Ostermark. I gave him around thirty-five thousand men to guard the province, and several thousand dawi would remain until the fortifications I had ordered were completed. In the future, Ostermark might well pay good gold to build new fortresses against the greenskins and necromancers who often roamed north in search of victims for their profane arts.\nIn addition to leaving hundreds of minor nobles as temporary governors —whose appointments could be revoked at any time in the Emperor's name— everything seemed set so that, in time, Ostermark's local economy would be stable and capable of defending itself. With that, at last, the lands of Ostermark would become fertile ground for agriculture and a recruiting pool of hardened soldiers for the Empire. I could say I had done my part: Ostermark now served the Empire absolutely.\nAll that was needed was to keep declaring that Ostermark remained in a state of emergency, to prevent the Elector Count of Talabecland from complaining too loudly about not regaining his lands now that the crisis was over. With that pretext, I could continue collecting taxes and recruiting men in the province without having to confront the nobility, who had been pushing their autonomy constantly.\nI also marched away with a lucrative contract with the Imperial general to supply weapons, powder, and uniforms to the army every month. That would pay back the cost of financing the army myself within a few years, and afterwards it would be pure profit. It was an investment in the long term: I had secured as a client the largest buyer of all, who needed everything to maintain functionality, and the only supplier was me.\nSo, as we marched back to Altdorf, we wasted no time, for the year's end was near and, as usual, people dreaded the Witching. Everyone wanted to be within their homes when that day came, so without delay we returned to Altdorf. Only now I had the icy eyes of the Tzar's daughter on my back at all times, as well as those of her protectors and magic tutors.\nYet there was silence, total silence. She only ever wished to stare at me, speaking only to ask about when the train to Kislev would be ready, or when the weapons would be available, or if I could sell armor in exchange for cheap raw materials. That was all our conversations: short, practical, with no interest beyond her homeland. She was intent on opening the flow of trade with the Empire as quickly as possible, but for now, until my orders reached Marienburg, commerce remained completely closed, with strict orders to deny all dealings with Kislev.\nWe arrived in Altdorf just a few days before the Witching. The city was already preparing for the dreaded day, when everyone locked themselves indoors to avoid the horrors of the night when daemons were strongest in the mortal realm.\nThis time there was no grand celebration like after the victory over Bretonnia, but there was joy nonetheless among the parents of the soldiers who had been in the province, seeing their sons return alive. For them, it had been nothing more than harsh training, since they had barely fought the beastmen, with the real weight of battle carried by my veterans.\nOnce at my mansion in Altdorf we began to unpack, letting my griffon roam free of its chains as it settled into its bed of pelts from beasts I had hunted.\nI immediately demanded an audience with the Emperor, for I had to claim my payment for being part of his political scheme. As soon as the Reiksguard guards recognized me at the gates of the Imperial Palace, they opened them and led me directly to the Emperor.\n\"So, I see you are prepared for any eventuality, aren't you?\" I said, noticing that he had his personal champion at his side, something rare, as the man was usually with his son.\n\"It never hurts to take precautions, especially after you threatened to kill my ambassador,\" said the Emperor, smiling calmly and serenely.\n\"What in Sigmar's name possessed you to marry me to the Kislevites without even consulting me?\" I asked, narrowing my eyes.\n\"This benefits you greatly. I doubt you cared for the details at the time, but Kislev has many resources that will now belong to you when the current Tzar dies and you stand as the husband of the future Tzarina. And when that day comes, you will likely be the father of the next Tzar, wielding immense influence over that state, paving the way to place the Cult of Sigmar firmly within their lands and expand the Empire's influence. In time, to include them within the great Empire of Man, as Sigmar intended,\" said the Emperor.\n\"Yes, but that doesn't change the fact that you made the decision without consulting me,\" I said, holding his gaze.\n\"I know what I did, Albrecht, but it was necessary. Do you think I like the idea of you dying without an heir? If you fall in battle, the Empire would be left at the edge of civil war —the same as it would if word of our arrangement, or what I just did, ever spread. I must close these problems quickly, and your refusal to marry, even to consider marriage, had me on edge,\" the Emperor replied.\n\"Ah, and now what happens if I die and the Westerlands, which cost so much to reconquer, pass into the hands of Kislev? Would that be part of Sigmar's plan? That a part of the Empire becomes Kislevite territory thanks to a poorly crafted scheme?\" I asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\"It was negotiated, and I am certain you were told: you would not be heir to Katarin, and Katarin would not be your heir in case one of you died,\" replied the Emperor.\n\"And if we only have one child?\" I asked, emphasizing the obvious.\n\"We will push for that child to be raised as a Sigmarite, and we will have a good Tzar we can trust, while providing all the necessary support to stabilize his rule, keeping the northern frontier secure,\" said the Emperor.\n\"Well, I suppose everything's settled then… Now, my payment. Because you know very well this thing you asked of me will not come cheap. And since we have all the Electors here, I can demand something very big,\" I said with a smile.\nThe Emperor's smile faded. \"What is it you want…? I thought the benefits of this marriage would be enough to satisfy you, my loyal general,\" said the Emperor.\n\"I am loyal, but I am not a lapdog, Luitpold. Just because you command it doesn't mean I will obey blindly. Especially now that we have the Electors here —whom you bribed with my gold, did you not?\" I said, staring at him.\n\"Indeed,\" replied the Emperor. \"But I also used my ambassadors and my own resources to deliver the gifts and secure the election. It is joint work, for a common goal.\"\n\"Yes, but now it's time for the Emperor to help fill my coffers a little, isn't it?\" I said seriously.\n\"What do you want, Albrecht? Gold? I could give you some, but the problem is that without a trustworthy lender, I cannot request loans from Marienburg… and you would hardly lend gold just to receive the same gold back, would you?\" asked the Emperor.\n\"I want the possibility of establishing a state bank to be considered. One that will mint the Empire's coinage… and that I, or someone of my absolute trust, will help oversee,\" I answered, fixing my eyes on him.\n\"Pff… what you're asking for is very… difficult. That would certainly be an enormous step in controlling the Empire… but… damn it… not everyone will look kindly on us having so much power over who mints the gold,\" said the Emperor, sighing.\n\"I suppose that, with the bribes already distributed, we could persuade most of the Electors that this is a good decision for the Empire. A single coin, a single standard, instead of hundreds of provincial mintings. That would ease Imperial trade, offering a unified medium of exchange. And not only that: I have another idea to make commerce and the movement of wealth even easier —eliminating the tedious dependence on physical metal,\" I said calmly.\n\"And how does that benefit you?\" asked the Emperor, narrowing his eyes, trying to find the trap\n\"My good Emperor, I would keep the interest from the loans. If the Electors deposit their gold in the bank, I lend it out… and collect the profits. If all agree, the profits will surpass the indemnity I demanded from Kislev many times over. Lending the Empire's gold to merchants and craftsmen would be infinitely more lucrative than any one-time payment,\" I said with a broad smile.\n\"Difficult… difficult… I am not sure I can persuade the whole Empire before the assembly… but perhaps some Electors, yes. Wissenland, for example, I can bring to the table. Averland, maybe, if we offer help against the greenskins in your coming campaign. Middenland and Middenheim would probably demand you cleanse their forests. Talabheim will likely not pose much trouble. Talabecland… that will be an obstacle, after what we did with Ostermark. And Ostland… well, we will see. I will do what I can, but I promise you nothing,\" said the Emperor.\n\"You will have to promise me more, because soon I will meet with the Grand Theogonist… and I have something that will be very valuable both to you and to the Cult of Sigmar,\" I replied, leaning forward.\n\"And what is that?\" asked the Emperor, raising an eyebrow.\n\"I'll tell you after the election of the Elector Count… and after my payment is placed on the negotiation table,\" I concluded with a calm smile.\n\"Very well… very well… we shall see what can be done. Now we must speak with the Grand Theogonist, to decide what to do about your new betrothed. We must meet him quickly, for I had conveyed your request to marry the Princess of Kislev, and he will be expecting this audience. His votes will be crucial for the election of the new Elector, and also for the matter of the bank. Keeping the Theogonist content will be essential,\" said the Emperor.\n\"Do not worry about that… Sigmar showed me in dreams what the correct answer would be,\" I replied calmly.\n\"Is this true… or are you making it up?\" asked the Emperor, narrowing his eyes.\n\"Do you think I would jest about Sigmar? I truly had those dreams… and they were terrible. The Grand Theogonist will be very interested in what I have to say to him,\" I said, staring at him intently.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Though I would have liked to return to Reinsfeld and enjoy my luxuries, this year would be a busy one, and likely the rest of the decade as well, until the Empire was cleansed of its internal rot and I could turn my gaze outward.\nOn this occasion, the cathedral was occupied only by the highest members of the clergy, with the presence of the Reiksguard and the Emperor, who was already inside, waiting for me to speak with the Grand Theogonist.\n\"Albrecht…\" said the Grand Theogonist the moment I stepped into the cathedral, his gaze fixed on me from atop the great stairway that led to the colossal statue of the Twin-Tailed Comet. \"I wish to speak with you at once,\" he added, surrounded by archlectors, with the Emperor at his side.\nI walked forward, stopping at the foot of the steps.\n\"Come up. I will not accuse you yet. I want to hear from your own mouth why you accepted this strange marriage,\" said the Grand Theogonist.\nI ascended until I stood before him.\n\"Young Albrecht, I want to believe this was done with Sigmar's faith in mind. Certainly, it opens the way for the Cult to expand into new frontiers, and I know it could be so —as with your project in Bretonnia, attempting to illuminate their lives with Sigmar's truth. But a marriage to an unlicensed sorceress… that is excessive,\" said the Grand Theogonist sternly.\n\"I know… I truly know,\" I replied, my voice somewhat nervous as I prepared the ground for my tale. \"But during my time in Kislev… I had three visions, Great Theogonist. Sigmar himself showed me glimpses of the future to come… and I must confess: the first vision terrified me.\"\n\"Speak. Sigmar always speaks the truth through his champion. I wish to hear and interpret these dreams,\" said Yorri, the Theogonist, never breaking eye contact.\n\"When I was set on striking Kislev to reclaim my honor before the dawi, after the broken treaty and the Tzar's refusal to pay me what was owed, that night, as I slept, a vision of Sigmar appeared before me. I saw Kislev utterly desolate, scourged by unspeakable atrocities. Men, women, and children falling into the hands of the corrupted, thousands mutating or being sacrificed to profane gods. The Empire suffered a similar fate: all its great cities falling beneath the greatest invasion yet, led by a new Champion of Chaos,\" I said, shaking my head and closing my eyes.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nThe Theogonist stared at me, wide-eyed.\n\"The vision showed me how each Imperial city fell, how altars of the dead were raised in the names of the profane. Portals opened everywhere… and in the rear, an endless horde of ratmen surged, cutting off all defense of the Empire. I saw the Empire die, fighting alone. And I saw my own death as well,\" I added with a bitter smile after taking a deep breath.\n\"I saw myself fighting against an endless tide of daemons. No matter how many I slew, they never ended. At last, my body was torn apart by daemon weapons, unable to withstand any longer, and I fell… to be claimed by profane champions,\" I concluded gravely.\nThe Grand Theogonist exchanged looks with the archlectors, and even the Emperor himself seemed shaken by what he heard.\n\"The End Times… they are near…\" said the Theogonist, less severe now, showing genuine concern.\n\"I fear so, Great Theogonist. That was enough to make me abandon my plan to strike Kislev… If Sigmar wished to convince me, He succeeded. I would not attack them further, even if it meant tarnishing my honor before the dawi. The second and third visions, fortunately, were much more… merciful, if one could say so,\" I replied.\n\"Continue, Albrecht. What else did Sigmar show you?\" asked the Archlector of Reikland.\n\"The second left me with the most doubts. This one was meant only for me. I saw a prosperous Kislev, with temples of Sigmar rising alongside Imperial banners, replacing those of the Tzar. I was there, gazing at that land, and at my side stood Princess Katarin. In her arms, she bore two children, and we were united. My interpretation was the union of my house with the throne of Kislev to carry Sigmar's light. That is why I asked the Emperor to intercede in my name —for I had attacked Kislev before, and with my lack of diplomatic skill, it was better he negotiate,\" I explained.\n\"That dream is… difficult to interpret. It could indeed be a solution… but considering the first dream, of the End Times, it is evident that Sigmar commands unity,\" said the Grand Theogonist, glancing at the other clerics, who nodded silently.\n\"And the third?\" asked one of the archlectors, watching me intently.\n\"The third dispelled my doubts. It was not immediate that I asked the Emperor to intercede. I debated whether Sigmar's command was for a military alliance, or something more. But this last vision resolved my uncertainty. In it, I was with Katarin, the Princess of Kislev, in a cavern… and we found…\" I paused, letting the suspense hang.\n\"What did you find?\" asked the Grand Theogonist, almost anxiously.\n\"The true Ghal Maraz,\" I answered.\nThe Emperor's eyes widened. \"How is it that… how…?\" he muttered, glancing around. \"How do you know it is false?\"\n\"Because Sigmar revealed it to His Champion —that much is clear. It is one of the Empire's most closely guarded secrets,\" replied the Grand Theogonist. \"And here is the proof: he knows. He knows the truth. Where did you find Ghal Maraz?\" he asked, nearly grasping my hands.\n\"In Black Fire Pass. That is where Ghal Maraz lies. Those were my dreams, Great Theogonist. Do you think I misinterpreted what only the clergy of Sigmar might understand?\" I asked, feigning concern.\nThe clergy of Sigmar exchanged looks.\n\"Young Albrecht, if we succeed in finding the hammer wielded by our lord Deus Sigmar, there can be no doubt that your dreams are true, and that a terrible storm draws near. We must prepare. Clearly, Sigmar has chosen to forge an alliance for this event. If that is so, I myself will officiate your marriage. If it is Sigmar's design, I have no choice but to obey. We must march at once to seek Ghal Maraz,\" declared the Grand Theogonist.\n\"If it is not too much trouble, Grand Theogonist, in two months I had planned to finance a great military campaign into that region. If you gather your men by then, we can unite our forces and search for Ghal Maraz in safety. It will be far better than rushing blindly and waiting for reinforcements to begin the quest,\" I replied.\n\"Two months… two months? Young Albrecht, it is Ghal Maraz we are speaking of…\" one of the Archlectors exclaimed, incredulous.\n\"The hammer has been lost for over two millennia… we can wait two months, so that the search is swift and we can cleanse the region of greenskins and mutants that infest it. The General and Champion of Sigmar clearly knows what he speaks of regarding military campaigns,\" said the Grand Theogonist.\nThe rest of Sigmar's clergy remained silent.\n\"Then we must waste no time. All religious orders must be summoned, all our men mobilized, and every resource of the clergy employed to obtain Ghal Maraz,\" said one of the Archlectors.\n\"Indeed. When the time comes, we shall march to Black Fire Pass and reclaim what has always belonged to our Lord,\" affirmed the Grand Theogonist.\n\"Then I will begin mobilizing at once. In the meantime, I shall cleanse the forests of Reikland, so that my men gain experience hunting beastmen. But without doubt I shall march with around forty thousand soldiers to aid in the search for our Lord's hammer,\" I told the Grand Theogonist.\n\"We are grateful for your aid, and I pray with all my heart that the vision Sigmar granted you soon comes to pass. The Empire must be ready for when the fell hosts march against us once more. We shall be prepared and united as never before,\" said the Grand Theogonist again.\n\"With your permission, I shall depart at once for the forests of Reikland, to cleanse them of the filth of the mutants,\" I said, descending the steps.\n\"Albrecht,\" said the Emperor, following me.\n\"What is it?\" I asked as I made my way down swiftly.\n\"Then… is it true? Those dreams of yours…?\" said the Emperor, visibly concerned.\n\"It is. Sigmar has often guided me to victory or aided me in moments of doubt, but now He has shown me something terrible. As you know, He revealed to me the End Times… the fate of the Empire, should we fail in our plans,\" I answered gravely.\n\"Indeed… we must be stronger than ever. We must drive forward our plans at the meeting with the other Electors. Your visions must be made known, so that the Cult of Sigmar sees the need to act in unity,\" said the Emperor.\n\"Exactly. For now, I shall do as I said: cleanse Reikland of the beastmen, hurling my army against them, and leave everything as secure as possible before marching to Black Fire Pass to begin the search for the hammer,\" I replied.\n\"And what of the meeting in the Volkshalle?\" asked the Emperor.\n\"I have no time for petty politics. Just tell them my vote is for Joachim, nothing more. If you wish, I will leave a signed letter, but I must begin at once. If I mean to cleanse the forests of Reikland, I should have started yesterday,\" I said as I strode away quickly toward my mansion.\nThe Emperor nodded and returned to his palace, while I did the same, preparing to set out on my mission to secure the Empire's internal borders.\nI wasted no time reaching my mansion, only to find several witch hunters at the gate, attempting to force their way in against the resistance of my guards.\n\"What is happening here?\" I asked, watching the witch hunters who blocked the entrance to my home.\n\"The answer is obvious,\" one of them said, pointing at me. My medallion vibrated fiercely.\n\"There is witchcraft on your property, and you had better give us a very good explanation,\" the hunter added.\n\"She is my betrothed… a mage of Kislev, with diplomatic immunity and tolerated by the Grand Theogonist. So unless you want to end up in a cell yourself for overstepping your authority, I suggest you stop pointing your finger at me,\" I answered, locking my gaze on his.\n\"Eh…\" he faltered, glancing at his companions, who began to retreat. \"We were not informed… my apologies, Champion of Sigmar,\" he finally said, withdrawing from the gate of my mansion.\nI entered at once to see what had happened.\n\"Katarin… you certainly made yourself comfortable,\" I said upon seeing that one of the chambers I had given her had been completely transformed into ice. She sat upon a throne of solid frost, surrounded by her sorceresses and guards, likewise accommodated on frozen seats.\n\"The room was empty, so I decided to decorate it a little,\" she said with a faint smile.\n\"You realize the witch hunters were outside? You came within a breath of fanatics trying to burn you,\" I warned her.\n\"It would be foolish of them to attack our newly forged alliance,\" she replied calmly.\n\"No one knows much of the alliance yet, Katarin. You must restrain yourself from using magic, at least until we have the Teogonist's sanction and I see what I can arrange with the Colleges of Magic to prevent such incidents,\" I said, rubbing the bridge of my nose.\n\"Of course,\" she replied, staring at me intently.\n\"Good… now come. We march south. There are beastmen to kill, and you will accompany me. You will earn the respect of the Cult of Sigmar,\" I told her.\nKatarin narrowed her eyes, glanced at her escort, and finally answered: \"Very well… I will help you.\"\nI nodded, and at once began sending letters to my captains and to Marienburg to organize the mobilization. Our first objective would be the Skaag Hills: to cleanse that region of beasts before pressing further south and securing the Empire's internal borders once and for all.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The mutants had crashed headlong into the first traps we had set, and their advance turned into a slaughter.\n\"Advance and finish off the fallen, they're already in retreat,\" I commanded, raising my runic mace high as I watched the beastmen begin to pull back after their futile assault against our forces.\n\"My lord, orders?\" asked one of my captains, scanning the battlefield now carpeted with twisted corpses.\n\"We don't have time to build lasting fortifications. We'll make do with palisades and trenches. Send scouts to search for beastmen monoliths and keep watch for any movement of another warband,\" I replied, riding toward the rear to check on the supplies.\nWe had marched quickly. The forests near Altdorf were surprisingly clean —surely thanks to the frequent patrols of the Reiksguard— but the lands in the domains of the margraves and other nobles were another story. Since I had built the railway, my rail guards had grown accustomed to exterminating anything that crawled out of the woods. But now the time had come to scour the region entirely, leaving it secure for cultivation.\nThis would not only strengthen the people of Altdorf and its surroundings, it would bring peace. And where there is peace in Reikland, there is prosperity: if we wiped out the internal enemies —beastmen and greenskins— the population could grow without fear.\nTime, however, was my greatest enemy. I had set myself a limit, and unlike Middenland, here I could not linger to raise fortresses or lure the herds against them. Here I could only fight in the open field, overwhelm them with superior fire, and keep moving forward. Fortunately, it was feasible: tens of thousands of musketeers, cannon batteries repositioning swiftly, and officers well-drilled in Ostermark for these maneuvers.\nThe only dilemma was that I was almost blind. With Katarin present, I could not use my magic freely, forcing me to step aside whenever I needed to sense the herds' movements. And the forests of Reikland were far more infested than I had expected, much worse than what the local nobility usually reported, preferring ceremonial hunts over true purges. Their numbers had grown dangerously.\nBut with nearly forty-five thousand men under my command, the task was simplified. I had split my forces into three armies, each responsible for a zone, and thus far all reports were favorable. The forests fell beneath the axes of locals and our lumbermen, while we ensured their safety.\n\"So this is the famed system that has earned you so many victories against this problem,\" said Katarin, watching as the snowy woods turned red while peasants and woodcutters felled trees under the protection of my soldiers.\n\"You could say so… though it's not my usual method. Here it's simpler: numbers are on our side. In Drakwald, for example, this would be impossible. There, the herds outnumber any human army, but here my men can fight them even on equal terms, and that allows us to advance quickly,\" I replied while giving orders to my captains to keep the purge going.\n\"And what do you normally do?\" she asked, intrigued.\n\"I build fortresses,\" I explained. \"Beastmen are creatures of habit, slaves to instinct. If you know those patterns, you can control them. The key are their monoliths: when you destroy and purify one, you send a signal that draws every nearby herd. They come seeking vengeance, believing they're defending their own, and crash headlong into your walls, where you wait with artillery and steel. That's how you turn them into victims of their own impulses.\"\n\"Why did you ask me to come? I thought you needed my magic above all, but here I am only watching,\" Katarin said, extending her hands as an icy aura began to seep from them.\n\"You need to be here because the Cult of Sigmar is annoyingly strict with wizards. They must see you fighting for the Empire. It is vital that you are present in these smaller victories, so that with the Emperor's and the Grand Theogonist's support we can request the Colleges of Magic to issue you a license to practice within the Empire. That will keep you safe from witch hunters, as well as your sorceresses. Otherwise, if I am not nearby, they might try to throw you into the flames of a pyre,\" I replied calmly, adjusting my steel gauntlet.\n\"In Kislev too, there are many who mistrust magic, especially among the boyars. Many oppose our circle of witches. But in the Empire… it seems the fear of mages runs far deeper,\" Katarin said, lowering her voice slightly.\n\"Yes. For centuries, too many catastrophes were caused by wizards who lost control —or simply turned to serve the Ruinous Powers. Even after the great archmage Teclis helped establish the Colleges of Magic to bring order, the stigma never faded. While nobles may appreciate a good spellcaster in their armies, it is still common for those who show the arcane gift to end up on the pyre before they can even reach Altdorf,\" I said, my eyes fixed on the horizon.\n\"General! We found one of the beastmen monoliths. Your men have already cleared the area. Shall we send for the priests to carry out the purification?\" one of my captains called, galloping up with his horse dripping with sweat.\n\"Yes. Send the order and prepare the men. When that monolith burns, we'll have a great wave of beasts upon us. I want the lines steady and the cannons ready,\" I commanded firmly.\nThen I turned to Katarin. \"Be ready. We'll have hordes of beastmen upon us, and I will need you to cover me if anything happens. Without solid walls, we depend on mere palisades, and that could mean a breach in our defenses. I need you to use your gifts without restraint if the line begins to break.\"\nKatarin nodded silently as the icy aura grew around her hands. I fastened my helmet, spurred my griffon forward, and moved to the front line, where my men were already preparing for the inevitable clash.\nIt wasn't long before the priests of Sigmar entered the forest, and after a few minutes dozens of my soldiers emerged from the trees with the priests behind them, having successfully completed the rituals required to purify one of the monoliths.\nI didn't need to use my magic to sense what would come; it was only a matter of time before a great wave of beastmen appeared.\nBarely minutes passed before the first of them began pouring out of the woods.\nMusket fire thundered in perfect unison as soon as they came into range. The white snow was soon stained crimson with the blood of the beasts, which fell in great numbers the moment they set foot outside the treeline.\nI remained watchful, prepared to intervene if my presence was needed, while receiving constant reports on horseback from my commanders, who relayed the movements of the warherds spilling out of the forest. For the moment, the situation was stable: as soon as they emerged, they were cut down mercilessly. I noted with a measure of calm that the forests of Reikland were far safer than the perpetual nightmare of Middenland.\nThus began a slow but steady fight. Every so often, hundreds of beastmen rushed out of the forest, only to be met with disciplined volleys of shot. From time to time minotaurs appeared, but concentrated fire brought their massive bodies crashing to the earth, shaking the ground beneath them. Occasionally wargors emerged —warherd leaders, many clad in armor consecrated to Khorne, while others bore the marks of different Dark Gods.\nOne in particular was consecrated to Nurgle. His stench was unbearable, and his armor was an abomination, a grotesque fusion of corroded metal and pulsating flesh that continued to throb even after its bearer was slain. The priests of Sigmar were forced to purify the armor and burn it immediately, for the risk of it spreading disease was far too high. Nurgle delighted in testing his creations in environments like this, where thousands of men lived crowded together in camps and trenches.\nI found myself thinking. Without doubt, Nurgle was the most dangerous of them all to the cities of men. Khorne's devotees at least could not resist their bloodlust and hurled themselves into combat without strategy; Slaanesh's lost themselves in excess and depravity; Tzeentch, always hidden, wove plans that took decades or centuries to unfold. But Nurgle… Nurgle needed only to release a single plague to doom a city in days, against which nothing could be done by the very nature of the infection.\nThough I had given the Cult of Shallya tools to fight disease —spreading the use of soap and promoting high-grade alcohol for cleaning wounds— I wondered if I should go further. What if I tried to create, for example, penicillin? Wouldn't it simply become an endless war of medicine against the bacteria?\nNurgle would learn from everything. Each cure would only give him a new challenge, a new excuse to create stronger plagues, testing our ability to adapt again and again.\nBut at least it had to be attempted. If Nurgle devoted himself to learning, then so must we. Better to fight uphill than surrender without resistance in a war that seemed lost from the start against the Lord of Plagues.\nWhile lost in thought, I suddenly felt the presence of dhar in the air. It wasn't long before hundreds of beastmen, dozens of minotaurs, and numerous wargors poured from the forest, charging at our infantry lines. The cannons roared without pause, blasting showers of grapeshot that shredded bodies and hurled chunks of corrupted flesh into the air, yet the largest of them still advanced, unstoppable in their fury.\nI moved to the front of my men, mace held high, ready to meet them. At my side, my griffon snorted in fury, wings half-spread, eager to tear apart anything that came too close.\nAnd then, from our rear, a great storm of ice spikes began to rain down, driving through the bodies of the beastmen with brutal force. The shards were so vast they skewered several enemies at once. The ice witches were channeling the Winds of Magic, reciting their incantations, their frozen chant rising above the thunder of battle.Googlᴇ search NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nThe air turned frigid. Many of the smaller beastmen froze where they stood, transformed into grotesque statues of ice before shattering into fragments. The battlefield became a terrifying spectacle: the fire of powder and cannon mingling with bursts of frozen sorcery.\nWhile they held back the lesser beasts, I sought the source of that dark energy. It did not take long to spot three clear signals: shamans channeling dhar to keep the herds together and force them to ignore their fear. They were the key; they had to die.\nI spurred my griffon, who spread his wings and soared in a mighty leap. We flew over the battlefield, dodging smoke columns and clumsy volleys of arrows. When I caught sight of the shamans, my mount dove in a furious plunge with an earth-shaking roar.\nThe first never had a chance: my beast's claws ripped him apart in an instant, reducing him to a mangled heap of flesh. The second tried to conjure a spell, but my griffon caught him in its beak, tearing his head off with a single savage jerk. A spray of blood drenched us both, and I heard the terrified cries of the nearby beastmen.\nThe third tried to flee. I did not allow it. My griffon dove savagely toward him, landing close enough for me to swing my mace. I heard every bone shatter under its force, the Dwarfen runes along my weapon flaring with lethal light in that instant.\nWith the three shamans slain, the herd lost cohesion. Many beastmen fled at once, overcome by panic. Others, however, tried to encircle us, hurling themselves desperately at my griffon.\n\"Fly!\" I ordered, and my mount spread its wings, soaring violently above the treetops, leaving those that surrounded us behind.\nWhen we returned over the camp, the scene had changed: heaps of beastmen lay impaled on enormous shards of ice, others frozen mid-stride, grotesque statues shattered by the ice witches. The rest were falling beneath the relentless volleys of my musketeers.\nAt the very least, it seemed this campaign would be swift. With a cadre of witches no longer forced to hide their gifts, the enemy had become far easier to destroy.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

A mission that in other circumstances would have taken years was now resolved in a matter of months thanks to the army that followed me and the machinery we had set in motion.\nOnly a few days into our cleansing campaign, large numbers of local noble troops joined us, eager to take part in the greatest beastman hunt ever organized in Reikland. Most of these nobles had ties to Margrave von Mackensen, who in those days was undoubtedly the happiest man in the Empire. Not only had he seen his firstborn confirmed as Elector Count of the Bretonnian March, but he was also grateful for the gift I had presented to him for this event, which motivated him to work closely with me, sending men and using his influence to draw other local nobles into the campaign.\nThe Emperor did not stand aside either: he sent his own general of the region, who brought with him fifteen thousand state troops to reinforce the operation. The difference was evident, for having someone competent who did not need constant instructions was a relief; it was enough that he simply replicated the tactics I had laid out.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ\nWith the sum of forces —the clergy of Sigmar, the nobles of Reikland, the state army, and my own men— we reached more than eighty thousand soldiers deployed constantly throughout the forests. The campaign turned into a massacre: hundreds of thousands of beasts were slaughtered in record time. But not only beastmen fell: we also hunted down numerous bandits and brigands who had been hiding in the forests near Nuln, dedicated to looting and robbery along trade routes. Their elimination restored safety to one of the Empire's most important arteries.\nFor the first time in a long while, Reikland was safe. Something that would not have been possible without two factors: the comparatively lesser strength and numbers of beastmen in this region —though their fertility remained alarmingly high, for every infested cave we discovered was filled with offspring born of mutated females or kidnapped human women— and the total backing of the Cult of Sigmar. The clergy had set into motion their full machinery of influence and military power, sending not only hundreds of warrior priests but also hundreds of witch hunters, who hastened the purge and added fanatical discipline to the campaign.\nThe mobilization was so vast that even thousands of peasants were recruited as lumberjacks to open clearings in the forest, accompanied by entire crews of laborers from Altdorf. Logging became part of the strategy: each area cleared meant fewer hiding places for the beasts and more land to cultivate. In the process, rich silver veins were discovered in the Skaag Hills, a find that made the Emperor smile. The vein was so large that, within days, thousands of workers had already been sent to open new mines, along with entire herds of livestock to populate the hills and establish permanent pastureland.\nAnd I had taken my share. The Emperor had delivered what I had requested of him earlier. Within the Volkshalle debates, the matter of the Central Bank was raised, and it proved far more controversial than any other issue. The reason was simple: it struck directly at the autonomy of the electors, since each province minted its own coins. This tested, like never before, the Emperor's skill and that of his diplomatic envoys in convincing the electors to cede part of their power and accept that monetary policy should fall under a common framework.\nThe discussions were endless: they negotiated how many coins would be minted each year, how they would be distributed among the provinces based on current minting, and the construction of a bank branch in every electoral territory with its own management council. The Emperor, skillful but pragmatic, managed to impose his will in some provinces, securing majorities on their councils; in others, he only managed to be a minority. But the key point was that all those councils, in one way or another, fell under my direct influence. That was the reward for my loyalty to his plans.\nNow I had control of monetary policy in several Imperial provinces, and strong influence in others. All that remained was to send letters to my mountain allies so that they could provide competent administrators for this enterprise. For now, what I most desired was to manage the interest from lending the Empire's coined money to merchants and artisans. I could even lend that gold to myself without interest. And when the time came, with the help of the dawi, I planned to introduce paper currency: I could buy up my own production of those new notes, trading gold for paper, and secure even greater control.\nThe result was an almost enviable power: much of the economy of Nuln, Talabecland, and Averland now fell within my sphere of control. Once all the dawi counselors took their seats, the flow of gold into my coffers would be constant, drawn from the interest collected to pay the debt the Emperor owed me.\nI also left everything prepared for the expansion of the railway toward Nuln, a project delayed precisely because of the numerous bandits in the region. Rarely did the state army or knightly orders bother to cleanse those roads, for there were always other problems demanding attention. As usual, it was the merchants who moved wills, and trade preferred the river: cheaper, faster, and more profitable for their purses.\nNow the road to Nuln was clear, the forests largely cut back, which freed up nearly five thousand men who had previously been dedicated exclusively to protecting the railway. They would continue guarding the watchtowers, but could now move toward Talabecland, where the forests remained infested with beastmen and brigands. This spared me the trouble of hiring more guards for the train.\nI had received troubling reports: a group had tried to damage the tracks, apparently linked to certain merchant guilds furious with the new economic situation. It was no surprise. The richest merchants had taken over the railway, using my services to move goods; ships were now left for middling traders, and the roads for the poorest. Wherever the railway arrived, ships became obsolete: they no longer had as much cargo to carry to or from Marienburg.\nOn the march south many troops of faith joined us, for in the search for Sigmar's Hammer no expense was spared: they sent everything available, mobilizing all their religious orders to support us.\nWe stopped only a few days in Averland, since there we purchased the supplies for this campaign. In Altdorf, food was somewhat scarce due to the ongoing military campaigns, and on top of that I had already bought much of the neighboring harvests to feed my new cities. This had caused food prices to rise considerably because of my intervention, for with the newly settled Bretonnians there was no other choice but to purchase food in bulk.\nThe Emperor had already done the hardest part: convincing the Elector Countess of Averland of the necessity of the campaign, as well as obtaining permission to recruit troops and to build a fortress. This fortress would not fall under the command of an Imperial general, but under the administration of the Cult of Sigmar, for it was more effective that it be defended by those prepared to fight daemons. The idea was to secure the place where sooner or later a daemonic invasion would come, and also to ensure that all the alternative passes in the region would be completely destroyed — even if that required provoking earthquakes or other controlled disasters.\nAfter only a few days' march across the plains of Averland we arrived at Grendzstat, a fortress-city that guarded the pass. Yet its position was not ideal. The fortress stood on the road, yes, but it did not block the pass itself, which made it of little use against enemies that did not rely on supply lines, such as greenskins or daemonic invasions. Against armies that did require resupply, the fortress had its worth: sooner or later they would have to besiege it. But against the forces of Chaos, able to advance without logistics of any kind, the fortress did not truly fulfill its duty of sealing the pass.\n\"Is there… any particular reason why we came to this place?\" said Katarin, noticing in the distance the mountains crowned with magma, with columns of smoke rising from some volcanoes.\n\"A mission of state, Katarin,\" I answered.\n\"I know. But it struck me as very strange that an entire religious cult would mobilize completely, following you, so it must be something important. I want to know what we are really doing here. My sisters won't be able to use their magic in this area… or it will be very difficult, especially now that spring is approaching. We are weaker then, and won't be of much use,\" she said.\n\"Your duty is more symbolic than practical, Katarin. Your presence is vital, though not with regard to your direct participation,\" I replied, watching the armies marching behind us.\n\"And what are we going to do?\" she asked, staring at me.\n\"Raise a fortress in the middle of the pass, instead of limiting ourselves to its exit,\" I replied.\n\"That would not have provoked such a massive movement from the Cult of Sigmar… you are hiding something from me, aren't you?\" she said, narrowing her eyes.\n\"Of course I am. It is an Imperial secret,\" I replied.\n\"You forget we are going to be married. Don't you think it wise that I know what we are doing?\" she said in a glacial tone.\n\"Indeed…\" I answered after thinking for a moment. \"Do you know how to block a mage's gaze when they try to read your future?\" I asked my betrothed, showing her my dawi ring.\n\"Yes, it was one of the first things I learned,\" she replied.\nI made sure no one was too close; the guards of both parties encircled the formation, but at a distance. Then I leaned toward her, placing a hand beneath her chin and bringing my mouth close to one of her ears.\n\"The reason we are here… is to seek the true Ghal Maraz. What exists in Altdorf is a copy, a very powerful runic weapon, but not Sigmar's legendary hammer. I know where it may be, and you must be at my side in this. The Grand Theogonist wants to annul our marriage, and if that happens, terrible things will fall upon Kislev. And my plan to extend the railway into your lands to buy raw materials cheaply would collapse. You must stand with me in this at every moment,\" I whispered.\nShe remained silent for a few seconds, surprised, until she regained her stoicism and calmly nodded.\n\"Ah, here you are,\" said a powerful voice behind me: a dawi.\n\"How may I help you, honorable dawi?\" I said, turning on my heel and placing Katarin at my side to address him.\nThe dawi approached, and I saw how a throng began to gather beside our forces.\n\"I have spoken, as you requested, with the High King Thorgrim. I asked him to hear your petition to the great king of the dawi and, after deliberation of the council, he has offered you an agreement you will surely find fair,\" said the ambassador. \"The dawi people are willing to cede possession of these lands —which belong to our folk— to the heirs of Sigmar, if the Empire promises to continue supporting the dawi in the liberation of the southern Karaks,\" added the diplomat.\nI gently pressed Katarin's back so she would follow me until I stood before the dawi.\n\"The generosity of the High King has no limits, ambassador. Does he mean to grant me dawi lands for something I already planned to do? He must have been in an excellent mood,\" I said with a friendly smile.\n\"Nothing of the sort, honorable Imperial noble. You are among the few umgi truly trusted across the whole Empire of great Sigmar. It was in consideration of this that the High King chose to make this decision. Moreover, it was deemed feasible to retake some of the abandoned Karaks in this area, so assistance was requested from the King of Karak Norn to claim them temporarily, until their rightful owners can reclaim them,\" he explained, pointing toward the dawi army.\n\"We are most grateful for the aid given by the dawi people. With a bit of luck we shall regain control of this region, and both our peoples shall prosper through mutual aid,\" I replied with a smile.\n\"I hope so, noble Imperial. If you'll excuse me, I shall return now to Altdorf. I also carry information from the High King for the Emperor,\" said the ambassador, taking his leave.\n\"It seems you get along well with the dwarfs,\" Katarin said.\n\"Of course,\" I said, gesturing with my hands toward my armor, ring, and runic weapon. \"Come, we must lead the search,\" I added, walking toward the pass.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Khazukan Kazakit-HA!... Khazukan Kazakit-HA!\"The dwarfs roared their battle cry, and the very mountains shook beneath the charge of the greenskins.\nThey had only just seen us, and already they were pouring down in waves, driven by a madness for blood that nothing could restrain.\nI have lived through wars in the frozen north, seen horrors that would freeze the heart of any man… yet what I saw here was beyond anything I had known. This was not the Empire I had imagined—a fractured realm weighed down by politics and old debts. No, before me stood a giant, awakened from slumber. Columns of troops stretched farther than the eye could see, banners whipping in the wind, drums thundering like the heartbeat of a single, united people.\nIt was impossible not to feel the weight of what sustained this host. It was not only lords and generals, nor the endless ranks of armed men. What marched at my side was faith itself—faith given flesh in their human god, Sigmar. The cult had pulled unseen strings, rousing tens of thousands, binding them under one purpose. And beside that tide, my betrothed's army advanced, steady and unyielding, ready for the clash.\nEven this one host dwarfed all Kislev could raise, no matter how desperate the levy. Perhaps, if Praag and Erengrad emptied their streets, we might match the numbers, but equipping them? Feeding them? Impossible. My grandfather left us much, and my father dreams of restoring Kislev's glory with it, yet our coffers are thin, stretched like ice in spring. Meanwhile the Empire brings forth more than sixty thousand soldiers, and still they call upon the dwarfs to fight beside them.\nBut it was not just the numbers that shook me—it was the weapons. Where we still cling to spears and bows to hold back the northern hordes, the Empire arms tens of thousands with muskets, each more finely crafted than anything I have seen. They had mountains of smokeless powder, and endless rows of cannons already unlimbered on the hills, aimed at the slopes where the greenskins came rushing down.\nThe first battery fired, and the blast nearly deafened my horses. Then a strange contraption, a whirring machine, spat fire without pause. One soldier turned a crank while another fed it with ammunition, and in seconds it poured a storm of lead into the green tide. I remembered those weapons—I had seen dozens of them across the river, when Albrecht and father negotiated. If they had been unleashed then… Kislev would have drowned in blood.\nOrcs and goblins tumbled by the hundreds, rolling down the slopes in grotesque heaps of flesh. Still they came, bellowing, shrieking, as if the world itself could be choked with their fury. But the Empire's guns tore through them like invisible blades. Each thunderous volley shook the earth, and in the lines ahead the cult's soldiers and the dawi stood ready for the final clash.\nOne of Sigmar's priests cried out, \"As our first Emperor crushed the green menace, so shall we—in his honor! In his name, show no mercy! In his name, let none survive! In his name, we shall prevail!\" His voice cracked like thunder, and before my eyes his body blazed with golden light. That power shattered like a wave, spilling over the men around him, who answered with wild, fervent cheers.\nThe army stood ready, but soon I understood—there would be no true battle. The war cries faded, drowned beneath the storm of artillery. Cannon after cannon spoke without pause, shattering the greenskins as they hurled themselves against an unbreakable wall of fire and steel. However many they were, it was not enough.\nAt last, the horde broke. Those few still breathing fled to their holes, never reaching the waiting line of men and dwarfs. The slaughter was over before it had even begun.\nAlbrecht's griffon landed beside me. He lifted the runic helm from his head, blue reflections dancing across its surface. \"It seems the greenskins lack the numbers this time. But word will spread among their warlords. Next time, they'll come with everything they have.\"\n\"What… what do we do now?\" I asked, still reeling from the chasm I saw between the Empire's might and my own people's.\n\"We advance,\" he answered calmly, as if it were already settled. \"The dawi will cleanse these slopes of the spores. The land won't favor the greenskins' return, but we won't take chances. Here we will build a fortress, with the dwarfs' aid. From it, the Empire will hold against every invasion from the south.\"\nWith that, he took to the skies again, his griffon's wings beating against the wind, and the host moved in column. Heavy horses dragged the cannons forward, and soon we saw thousands of soldiers taking positions on the ridges. Muskets cracked without end in the distance—the fighting still raged in the high places.\nFor us the path was easier. We reached a point chosen by both dawi and Imperial architects as the best ground for the work. Camps sprang up at once, and I walked with Albrecht as the dwarfs unrolled their plans, debating with the Empire's engineers. Then I realized: this was no mere fortress. This would be a wall spanning the entire pass, its flanks anchored by the mountains themselves. A colossus of stone and iron, planned to hold more than two hundred cannons. Any enemy that came within range would be torn apart.\nIt was a brutal, undeniable reminder of the gulf between our nations. Kislev dreamt of reclaiming its glory with counted coins, stretching every crown until it cracked. The Empire, meanwhile, could hurl the wealth of entire provinces into arming a massive host—just to cleanse a single region.\nEven as the day spiraled into chaos, the killing never stopped. On the hills the zealots of the Cult butchered greenskins with tireless fury, while in other places they flushed out beastmen and cut them down with the same sacred wrath. By the time night fell, the front had quieted, but the air still smelled of blood and smoke. That was when Albrecht entered my tent. My handmaidens did not dare stop him.\n\"Katarin, take what you need. We leave tonight,\" he murmured.\n\"What?... Where?\" I asked, narrowing my eyes, unable to hide my surprise.\n\"I think I know where Ghal Maraz lies. But I need you to come with me—alone.\" His tone froze the blood in my veins.\n\"Do you realize how foolish that is? The greenskins swarm everywhere, and you have an army vast enough to crush them—yet you refuse to use it.\" I could not keep the distrust from my voice.\n\"It's underground. Numbers are useless there. Besides… there is something I want to show you.\"\n\"I hope you're not leading us to an early grave,\" I muttered, following him out to where his griffon waited.\nHe mounted with ease, then held his hand out to me. I took it, and with his pull I swung up behind him. The beast spread its wings, and suddenly we were rising into the night sky. I clung to him as the rush of air tore at my hair and cloak. Below us, the hills still crackled with battle—scattered skirmishes lit by fire and torchlight. Farther out, I saw greenskin camps spreading like disease across the land.\nAt last we descended into a valley littered with butchered corpses.\n\"This is it… a Dawi Karak. Who knows from which age,\" Albrecht said, dismounting and striding straight into the dark cave.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\n\"What are you doing, idiot? This isn't safe! It could be crawling with vermin. Call your men,\" I snapped, following him grudgingly into the blackness.\n\"Why do you stop?\" His voice echoed in the gloom.\n\"Because I can't see a thing—only the glow of your runes,\" I answered, guided only by the faint shimmer of his armor.\n\"Right.\" He gripped my hand firmly. \"Careful. There's a steep drop.\"\nWe descended together. With every step, the Winds of Magic thickened around him. Was it his rings, the runes etched into his armor, or the mines themselves pulling at the metal? Whatever the cause, the energy pressed heavier and heavier against my senses.\nSoon a dim light revealed a vast gallery. Dwarfen statues, shattered but still imposing, loomed among broken columns.\n\"This Karak must once have been in its prime… I'm no expert on Dawi culture, but this is ancient. I've only seen statues like these in Karaz-a-Karak,\" Albrecht murmured, almost reverently.\n\"You've seen it. Now let's go back. If we die here, no Ghal Maraz will be worth the folly,\" I snapped, my patience wearing thin. Yet his eyes held a determination I had never seen in him before.\n\"We're here now. If the hammer is here, we take it.\"\n\"Stop playing the hard man, Albrecht. I've seen that act a hundred times in Kislev. It always ends the same way: men dead from pride.\"\n\"I only want the damned hammer… wait, haven't you felt it yet?\" he asked, surprised.\n\"Felt what?\" I lifted my hands in exasperation.\n\"WAAAAAAGH!\" An orc, iron-clad and bellowing, charged us with an axe the size of a man.\n\"Damn it! I can barely use my magic here—the heat of these volcanoes smothers it. I won't be able to help you,\" I cried.\n\"I don't need your help, honestly,\" he said, utterly calm.\n\"Watch out!\"\nI saw him close his fist—and the orc exploded. Its armor buckled inward, bones and flesh crushed into a twisted mess. The wave of raw power that burst from Albrecht left me breathless.\n\"You… you're a wizard,\" I whispered, stunned.\n\"Yes. And a damned good one,\" he said, raising his hands again. The orc's mangled armor twisted into floating blades.\n\"Magic without incantation… do you realize the risk you're taking?\"\n\"I've been using this craft for years. I forced myself to master it. I hide from witch hunters and from other magisters, so none of them decide I should be ashes.\"\n\"Years?\" I echoed, staring at him as the realization sank in.\n\"Yes… years.\" He flung the blades into the tunnels.desperate shrieks erupted in the dark, echoing. I could only imagine bodies being torn apart, unable to see the slaughter his sorcery wrought.\n\"But… I only awakened my powers a year ago. If yours manifested so young, then… your affinity must be immense,\" I admitted, shaken by how easily he wielded such forces.\n\"I awakened months after my father's death. Those were wretched days. I thought I'd be chained again to a fate I couldn't control,\" he said, striding on through a corridor littered with mangled corpses. \"The Colleges of Magic are a prison. So I sought a master on my own… and I found one. He trained me in secret, and I forged myself with my power. So congratulations, Katarin: you are to wed the greatest fraud of the Empire.\" He chuckled, but there was no humor in his eyes.\n\"And why tell me this? It's your greatest secret… sharing it is reckless beyond belief.\" I studied him closely, the glow of his magic swirling at his fingertips.\n\"We're to be married. I'd rather avoid a poisoned bond where we end up wishing for each other's death. Better to start with truth. This is my truth. If you cannot trust me after this, then nothing matters.\" He clenched his fists, and in the distance a deafening roar shook the cavern. \"The bastard coming must be their warlord… soon I plan to reveal it publicly, so you are the second to know—after my master.\"\n\"You'll make it public?\" I asked, astonished, even as blood still dripped around us.\n\"Yes. Because I believe I've gathered enough influence in the Empire, enough respect, that even the greatest lie can be accepted as truth.\" His words rang like an oath. He gestured, and suddenly an iron mass smashed through a wall, collapsing it in a roar of dust.\nAlbrecht strode into the haze without hesitation.\n\"Hello, beautiful…\" he murmured, his eyes glinting strangely. The chamber ahead glowed with an ancient light.\n\"The hammer…\" I whispered, seeing it resting upon its pedestal.\nAlbrecht stepped forward, reached out, and seized Ghal Maraz. He lifted it high with a grip as sure as if it had always been his.\n\"We have it. We should leave, now,\" I urged, unsettled by the mounting pressure of magic in the air.\n\"Albrecht… Albrecht…\" I called, louder, shoving at him. But he did not move. His body was rigid, frozen in place like a statue of stone, the hammer raised aloft.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The sensations of metal, the control over the metallic objects I had been manipulating to slaughter greenskins, vanished in an instant.\nThe warhammer I had lifted so effortlessly before now weighed as though it were made of tons, nearly tearing my arm out of its socket. I could barely hold it aloft for a few seconds before it slowly descended until it touched the ground.\n\"What the hell…?\" I muttered, looking around. Everything was white—none of the gloomy caves of the dawi karak remained.\n\"That belongs to me,\" said a deep voice behind me, as a golden gauntlet settled on my shoulder.\nI turned slowly. Before me stood a man far taller than myself, with a thick beard and resplendent armor. He took the hammer with absolute ease, as if it weighed nothing.\n\"Ah… shit…\" I whispered, recognizing at once the similarity to the many statues I had seen in temples and cathedrals. I was standing before Sigmar Heldenhammer.\n\"So tell me, little liar… do you know how difficult it has been to summon your soul here?\" said the god.\n\"N-no… no idea, my lord,\" I replied, trying to regain composure.\n\"I doubt I am your lord. You have never offered me a sincere prayer… I think the term common interests is more fitting, don't you agree?\" Sigmar said, circling me slowly, swinging the hammer with ease.\n\"Yes… I think that would be far more accurate,\" I answered, forcing calm into my voice.\n\"Good, little liar. I know well that you have used my name for your politics. Normally, I would have sent a sign to some priest to uncover your trickery… but the more I watched you, the more I saw your intentions aimed at strengthening the Empire I left behind centuries ago. We share the same enemy. Even so, your unorthodox—dangerous—methods leave much to be desired,\" he said, stopping before me and leaning on the hammer.\n\"Indeed, we do share the same enemy. And I don't want my soul devoured by daemons, so I'd say we have quite a bit in common,\" I answered with a nervous smile, feeling his gaze judge me.\n\"What is your ultimate goal? Do you covet the Imperial Crown?\" asked the first Emperor.\n\"What? Not in the slightest! I hate politics. The farther I stay from it, the better. All I want is peace, that the storm of Chaos never reaches me, gold in my pockets and nothing more to worry about. If to achieve that I have to beat daemons to death, I will,\" I said, slamming my fist into the palm of my other hand.\n\"Ha… interesting. Though you are a liar, you may be of use in ending the reign of the Ruinous Powers. As you know—and I do not know how you know this, truth be told—a great storm approaches. It will test the very foundations of all I built. But they will not be alone… I plan to bless one of the children of the Unberogen. When that happens, you must be there to protect him, to ensure he is nurtured and prepared for the great battle,\" said Sigmar, circling me like a predator.\n\"A demigod on our side… that would tilt the balance when the Everchosen comes. I'll make sure that when he is born, he is found immediately and placed in the hands of the best masters and warriors, so that divine fragment will be ready,\" I answered, calmer now.\n\"Good. Then we will collaborate. I shall overlook your abuses of invoking my name for your own gain,\" said Sigmar, spinning the hammer and offering it to me by the haft.\n\"Only one more thing, my lord…\" I said, not taking it yet.\n\"Don't tell me you are going to bargain?\" he said, frowning.\n\"I am a mage. Magic is my greatest strength. Even if I wield a powerful weapon, I still need to use my gift freely. If I could wield my magic in the Empire without persecution, I would finish with the internal threats sooner, reinforce the borders, and we could dedicate our resources to the true enemies. We might even subjugate Bretonnia, Tilea, and Estalia, bringing them under the aegis of the Empire and forcing them to contribute to the great war,\" I said with seriousness.\n\"I know perfectly well that you are a mage. And that you have practiced without restraint under the guidance of a lunatic who sought to mimic elven sorcery. But I have seen what you can do… and I must admit I am astonished. Probably the finest sorcerer of Chamon I have ever seen, or at least one who uses his gift in a different way. What is it you want of me?\" asked the god.\n\"A dream for the Grand Theogonist. If he knows you granted me the gift of magic, we will avoid many problems,\" I demanded firmly.\n\"One more lie, little liar?\" asked Sigmar, still holding the hammer.\n\"The last one, my lord,\" I answered without hesitation.\n\"Pfff… sometimes small sacrifices are necessary to achieve something greater. I will ensure the Grand Theogonist dreams of this conversation… omitting, of course, your many lies,\" said Sigmar, extending the hammer to me once more.\nI reached out, clenched my fist around the legendary weapon, and felt the golden figure begin to fade into light.\n\"Beware of their traps,\" were his last words before vanishing before me.\nAll the white brilliance began to dissolve, and once more I found myself where I had been.\n\"Damn… my head,\" I muttered, pressing a hand to my temple as I tried to recover from the conversation.\n\"So, what in the hell just happened?\" said a voice behind me.\nWhen I turned, I saw Katarin. She was covered in blood and greenskin viscera, her face gaunt. Even my griffon was there, drenched in the fluids of the enemy, feathers matted from what had clearly been a massacre.\n\"An audience with the owner of the hammer… gods, my head hurts,\" I answered, gripping Ghal Maraz tightly in my hands and feeling the legendary weight of the relic. Around me, the mountain was a graveyard: corpses of orcs and goblins everywhere.\n\"What happened here?… I only remember a few of them,\" I said in confusion, staring at the carnage.\n\"Almost two days, you bastard!\" Katarin shouted, her eyes burning with fury. \"You stood still like a statue for almost two days! If it hadn't been for me dragging your griffon back down, we'd both be dead.\"\n\"Hey, hey… I didn't decide Sigmar felt like having a chat with me,\" I replied, trying to downplay the matter as I pushed myself to my feet. Hunger hit me like a hammer, gnawing at me as if I hadn't eaten in weeks.\n\"Fine… we can get out of here now,\" she said hoarsely, her eyes red with exhaustion, her magical sword still crackling with frozen energy.\n\"Let's go… I owe you one, Katarin,\" I admitted, as together we began to climb toward the surface of the dawi karak. My pounding headache made even the thought of using my magic unbearable, so the wisest course was to avoid as many greenskins as possible. But that soon proved impossible: the karak had overflowed with them.\nThe first in my path was a massive orc clad in rusted dwarf-forged armor. I swung the hammer in a single motion, and the impact obliterated not only the greenskin but also his armor, scattering entrails in every direction.\n\"Ah… now this is a weapon,\" I said with a savage grin as the runes of Ghal Maraz burned brightly across its surface. \"If it weren't the ultimate symbol of Imperial prestige, I'd never return it.\"\nThe dawi runes blazed with every strike, casting their own searing light into the cavern's gloom.\nI grabbed Katarin's hand and we pressed on toward the exit, forcing our way through the orc-infested tunnels. Even in the narrow passages, the hammer was divine judgment: one blow was enough to pulp orcs regardless of the scrap they wore. Even the rare ones who had scavenged fragments of runic armor in past raids were crushed as though they wore leather.\nBreaking out of the karak, step by bloody step, we stumbled straight into the center of a massive greenskin camp. Thousands of orcs and goblins stared in silence, glaring from tents, palisades, and rocky ledges. The hush lasted only seconds—heavy, oppressive, like the calm before the storm.\n\"Get on the griffon and don't make any sudden moves,\" I ordered Katarin, walking slowly toward my mount. With one leap I was on its back, reaching down to haul her up beside me. Once we were settled, the griffon spread its wings and launched skyward just as the cacophony of orcish roars thundered behind us.\n\"Damn… there's so many,\" I muttered, glancing back at the sprawling camp stretching to the horizon.\n\"I don't know…\" Katarin said, clinging to my armor. \"Like I told you—you were motionless for nearly two days. In that time more and more poured in.\"\n\"Damn it… I would've been nothing but a trophy in this cesspit,\" I growled, baring my teeth as we climbed higher.\n\"Let's just get back to camp quickly. I don't want to know what happened to you… but I'm starving,\" Katarin sighed, her voice heavy with fatigue.\nWe flew in silence. Below us sprawled the wreckage of shattered greenskin camps: ashes, charred timbers, and abandoned corpses. I could make out columns of the Imperial army moving through clearings, confident the purge was still underway.\nIt wasn't long before we soared over the foundations of the new fortress rising in the pass. From there we descended slowly.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nThe moment my griffon touched earth, it loosed a hungry roar. Soldiers and men-at-arms rushed to surround us, some running toward me in relief.\n\"Thank Sigmar, we thought we had lost you, my lord,\" one of my men gasped. But it wasn't my disappearance that seized their eyes—it was the hammer in my hand.\n\"Bring a cow for my griffon, she's starving… and bring food for me and my betrothed. We are both famished,\" I ordered as I helped Katarin dismount.\nThe men hurried. A cow was led to my griffon, which pounced and tore it apart with a savage roar. We were handed simple rations—bread and roast meat—which I devoured greedily; nothing tastes so good as when you haven't eaten for days.\nAs I ate, I noticed movement on the horizon of the camp. A solemn procession of clergy approached swiftly, led by none other than the Grand Theogonist himself. His expression radiated fervor, and when his eyes fell upon the hammer in my hands, a jubilant smile split his face.\n\"Ha… ha… ha…\" he laughed with exultation, raising his voice for all to hear. \"The hammer of our Lord! Just as in my dream!\" He stretched his hands toward me, pleading.\nI hesitated for a moment before finally placing it into his grasp. The Grand Theogonist whispered prayers, and the blessing of Sigmar enveloped the weapon in a sacred glow.\n\"Yes… yes…\" he whispered through tears. \"The legendary hammer… returns once more to the Empire.\" Overcome with emotion, he fell to his knees before Ghal Maraz, gazing upon it as if it were Sigmar's very face wrought in steel.\nHis features shone with fervor and awe as he lifted one of his amulets toward me, seeking confirmation of what he already suspected.\nI drew a deep breath and, for the first time in many years, let the magic flow freely. I offered no resistance; I did not hide it or suppress it. I merely channeled it through my old elven amulet, shaping it into a subtle aura around me.\nAt once, the amulets of every priest of Sigmar vibrated violently. One by one, they clutched their pendants, first staring at them and then fixing their eyes on me. The silence was absolute. All waited for the Grand Theogonist's judgment.\n\"You spoke… you spoke with our Lord,\" Yorri said, his voice trembling yet smiling still. \"You were granted the highest privilege. He has given you a gift… as I can see… a gift of magic bestowed by Sigmar himself.\"\nHis gaze swept across the archlectors before returning to me. \"The first mage in all Imperial history in whom the clergy can place full trust!\" he proclaimed, his voice booming across the camp.\nA murmur of astonishment rippled among the priests and soldiers. Many fell to their knees, others lifted their arms skyward. Soon, like a tide, every priest broke into prayer, chanting hymns of gratitude. The name of Sigmar thundered again and again.\nWell… now it's my turn to deliver, since none of this came free.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Katarin stared at me, stunned.\n\"Well… perhaps not,\" I said, quickly slipping the collar back on.\n\"What… what was that?\" she asked, doubt heavy in her voice.\n\"Seems I still need the collar if I want to live a normal life,\" I answered, turning the elven metal over in my hands.\n\"What kind of arcane artifact can hide such an outpouring of the Winds?\" said Katarin, her eyes still wide.\n\"A gift from my master… an arcane collar crafted by the elves of Ulthuan under the supervision of the mages of the White Tower. So yes, it must be an artifact of great power. I had thought of giving it to you, but it seems I'll still need it. If you were startled to see me without it, I can only imagine what the Empire's magisters will say if they ever see me unprotected,\" I said, tucking the collar back under the mail, hidden from prying eyes.\n\"I wasn't frightened… but I was surprised,\" she admitted. \"I saw you in that Karak… if you truly wield all that power, I can't imagine what else you could do.\"\n\"Plenty of very interesting things come to mind… though I must ensure everything goes smoothly first. Too many of those ideas are… somewhat risky,\" I replied with a smile as I adjusted my armor.\n\"Now there's a surprise,\" said Katarin dryly. \"But you shouldn't flaunt your magic. If you suddenly appear as a master of Chamon, casting spells without chants or rituals, suspicion will fall on you everywhere and—\"\nI pressed a finger to her lips. \"Someone's coming,\" I whispered, sensing presences approaching my tent.\nA moment later, a man entered. \"My lord, the Grand Theogonist wishes to speak with you about how to carry the campaign forward,\" said one of my men-at-arms, clad in runic plate armor, bowing deeply.\n\"I shall attend at once,\" I answered. Then I turned to Katarin. \"I'll make sure the next shipment of weapons is ready when the rail line to Kislev is.\"\nKatarin nodded, and I left the tent, heading toward the Grand Theogonist's altar. There, in the heart of the camp, a temporary shrine to Sigmar had been erected on the very ground where a fortress would soon rise. The clergy insisted that the central keep must become a cathedral to their god—and I had no intention of opposing them, since it would be their gold and their men defending it.\nThe sight that greeted me made me pause. Dozens of priests of Sigmar knelt in prayer before Ghal Maraz, set upon a pedestal. Men of faith streamed in ceaselessly to prostrate themselves before the hammer, raising prayers with tears in their eyes. For them, this was a once-in-a-lifetime moment: to pray before the very weapon of the first Emperor and god of the Empire.\nI continued on, watching as thousands of dawi and laborers fortified the area. The magma-crusted ground made work difficult, though for the dwarfs it was only an obstacle that meant more time.\nI entered the Grand Theogonist's pavilion, where he was surrounded by his archlectors and witch hunters, all reporting on the battlefront.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, champion of the divine,\" said the Grand Theogonist, looking at me.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, Grand Theogonist,\" I replied, stepping toward the circle of clergy.\n\"I know you are still adjusting to our Lord's new blessing, but we must continue with the great campaign before us. We must cleanse the pass of greenskins. According to our pegasi scouts, a massive tribe is gathering in the area, the final obstacle to securing the campaign. Once that tribe is destroyed, there will be no risk left to the workers,\" said the Grand Theogonist.\n\"Yes, I know. When I emerged from the dawi karak where our Lord's hammer lay, I saw with my own eyes how a vast horde of greenskins was massing nearby. From my griffon, I could see them everywhere. We face a great concentration under a single warlord, which means they'll soon attack us,\" I answered.\n\"And what do you recommend?\" asked one of the archlectors, fixing his eyes on me.\n\"Let them come to us,\" I said. \"We have dozens of cannons, thousands of firearms, and the Empire fights greenskins best on the defense. I can send my men to provoke them, force them to attack, and if possible split them into isolated groups we can crush one by one. But we must be well fortified. Cannons in place, fields of fire prepared, multiple lines of musketeers firing in sequence, and ample powder ready for every gun and cannon so they cannot overrun us before we're set.\"\n\"It seems a prudent idea,\" said the Grand Theogonist. \"We have the means to withstand such an assault. We must gain as much time as possible reinforcing our defenses and be ready for their inevitable attack. And when we have the victory, we shall return to Altdorf to deliver the hammer to its rightful bearer.\"\n\"Yes… although I have no plans to return to Altdorf, at least not for the moment,\" I replied with a smile.\n\"But… and your ceremony, Champion of Sigmar,\" the Grand Theogonist countered. \"I was to officiate your marriage to… the witch… the princess of Kislev. Sigmar Himself blesses the union, and it would be best for the benefit of both peoples that the ceremony be completed as soon as possible.\"\n\"About that… I have my army here. Returning to Altdorf would be complicated, so I must be efficient, Grand Theogonist. Every day must be used to secure the Imperial frontiers. The best course is to seize the moment and launch a campaign into the Border Princes. That way we can quickly establish a rail line between the Empire and Karaz-A-Karak, fulfilling the promise made to High King Thorgrim, to use the lands that once belonged to the dawi and build this fortress.\"\n\"Well, you are right, Champion of Sigmar… delaying the ceremony to launch a campaign already at hand is prudent. But how much do you plan to conquer?\" asked the Grand Theogonist.\n\"Hmmm… given the strength of my forces… all of it… yes, all of it,\" I answered, nodding my head.\n\"Ah… I think this must be consulted with the Chosen of Sigmar. I may speak on internal matters of Imperial politics, but foreign policy belongs solely to the Emperor. An open war with the Princes would be watched closely by all our neighbors, especially so soon after the war with Bretonnia. To conquer all the Border Princes would be, without doubt, hard to accept without heavy diplomatic protest,\" said the Grand Theogonist.\n\"The Emperor will accept. He will see that my intentions are to secure the Imperial borders—above all to end the bloodletting in that region from endless wars between princes and their feuds. It is necessary for the Empire, since we must honor our duty to High King Thorgrim. The more feasible it is to move troops between our spheres of influence, the more we can aid our allies in reclaiming their lost Karaks… and in times of need, they can aid us as well, without relying on the fickle loyalty of a Border Prince who could sever the rail line,\" I replied.\n\"That… will be difficult…\" said one archlector, folding his arms.\n\"We must be swift and brutal. Reforge the South March of the Empire, build fortresses to halt the advance of greenskins, and keep the beastmen under control in that region. With that, we will have secure lines of communication with the dawi, in excellent condition,\" I answered firmly.\n\"Well… leaving aside all this talk of conquering other realms of Man, we must focus on what lies before us: the greenskins massed against us,\" said the Grand Theogonist.\n\"My cannons will be positioned, and my men ready, Grand Theogonist. We shall await battle with eagerness. When I judge us prepared, we will fight. Until then, we will launch small skirmishes against them to reduce their numbers, while avoiding drawing the full horde upon us,\" I answered.\nOnce the meeting ended, we quickly began preparations: digging trenches to place multiple lines of musketeers, as well as emplacing cannons on elevated ground with perfect fields of fire. The hardened, crystalized earth of the pass made the work heavy, but also ensured that a direct greenskin charge would be far harder to execute. At the same time, cavalry patrols were dispatched to hunt down small warbands, while the first foundations of the fortress began to rise.\nAs the days passed, all our cannons were positioned, ready to unleash a massive barrage across the pass as soon as the enemy dared to advance. Huge stocks of powder and shot were stored in small powder magazines placed strategically, so no front would run out of supply at the critical moment.\nWe also recalled all our troops scattered on lesser missions. Many had been deployed across the hills and mountains, hunting down small groups of greenskins and Chaos beasts. Among these operations was the clearing of an abandoned dawi Karak held by goblins, where I sent my personal cavalry alongside the shotguns designed by my dwarf engineer. The result was swift—the fortress was purged within hours. The goblins, unable to withstand the hail of shot, fell in droves.\nIt seemed the greenskins had gathered there because the Karak's acoustics gave them perfect echoes. They spent hours growling and shrieking, filling the valley with dreadful cries that unsettled my men. Its cleansing, however, resounded even further: the booming of shotguns echoed through the mountains, and the agonized howls of a goblin shaman—who tried in vain to curse me, thwarted by my runic ring—rattled for long moments before dying away. For my soldiers, and especially for the clergy of Sigmar, it was a relief to know those noises had been nothing but goblins… now silenced forever. With the fortress once more in dawi hands, we had an ally at the gates of our campaign, able to send reinforcements in case of dire need.\nThe days passed, preparations ended, and at last we were ready to receive the great green tide. We had dozens of cannons, multiple repeater cannons, organ guns, and more than eight lines of musketeers, all entrenched to fire in unison. It was a wall of iron, fire, and powder prepared to tear apart any advance.\n\"Just as Sigmar once did, the green threat shall be crushed,\" I said as I watched my riders gallop toward the pass to provoke the greenskins and draw their gaze.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.Google seaʀᴄh\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------\nI have two offers for you:If we reach 25 comments I can give you the next chapter to continue the story or… for those who prefer information, I can update details about the Empire, Bretonnia, Estalia, Tilea, and Kislev, showing the current balances and problems and also update information about the domains of MC, at your choice.",

Lend me some of your power to defeat my fears and allow me to take part in your war against evil,\" I prayed in a low voice, close to the holy hammer resting on the pedestal at the center of the camp. The Ghal Maraz itself, the most sacred relic in all the Empire, gleamed under the watchful eyes of a circle of priests and warrior-clerics.\nAt my side, Lukas also whispered prayers. Both of us were seizing the once-in-a-lifetime chance to kneel before the true Hammer of Sigmar, something no common man could hope to experience. The moment was all the more solemn because our general —the Prince of Marienburg— had been granted the honor of speaking face-to-face with the god of mankind himself. The Grand Theogonist would not stop repeating it: he claimed Sigmar had called upon him directly, though no one truly knew what words had passed between them.\nBut knowing our lord, he had surely begged for the one thing he always seeks: knowledge of how to destroy the enemies of the Empire. These past months under his command had taught us how skilled he and his veterans were in hunting down monsters. For two entire months we dedicated ourselves to eradicating beastmen in the forests of Reikland, leaving no lair, herd, or spawn alive. The woods were reduced to charred stumps, a few lonely trees, and ashes —but not a trace of those vermin remained.\nWhen we thought at last we would be given rest from soldiering, another marching order came. This time it was no mere expedition or punishment against barbaric Kislevites: our army, one of the largest in the Empire's history, descended through the plains of Averland.\nAt first rumors of rebellion spread: that some Elector Count had dared defy the Emperor and we were to bend him to his knees by force. But soon we learned the truth: we were not marching against any nobleman, but towards Black Fire Pass. Our mission was to clear the roads that linked the Empire to the southern Border Princes, secure the route, and raise fortresses.\nSome compared it to the campaign in Kislev. Yet there we had met little resistance: the Kislevites were terrified by the size of our host and, save for skirmishes, never dared face us in open field. Here, however, we were up against the greenskins —a very different foe. Though we outmatched them in numbers, weapons, and discipline, they lacked fear. They charged again and again, roaring and pounding their drums, no matter the losses. Only when the slaughter became unbearable would they scatter in disorder.\nFor days we had been accompanying the patrols of the clergy, scouting hills and mountains swarming with orcs. More than once we were forced to open fire, shooting point-blank into the creatures, watching them collapse heavily with their chests pierced by lead. But the rest of the fighting fell to the warriors of Sigmar's cult, who locked themselves in endless, bloody, exhausting duels where we did what little we could —we were good with firearms, but melee was another matter.\nAt most, we simply thrust our bayonets into orcs when the chance arose, or fired nearly at muzzle's length to take weight off the shoulders of the Sigmarite warriors who held the vanguard. So the days passed, and at first we thought this would be a short campaign: kill a few thousand orcs and return in triumph. After all, it was always said that this region did not hold so many greenskins —or so the merchants who crossed it claimed.\nBut reality struck soon enough. Out of nowhere, more and more orcs, goblins, and even giants appeared, from gods knew where. The only certainty was that before us lay a massive greenskin encampment, so vast that scouts reported they outnumbered us overwhelmingly. One of those scouts, mounted on a pegasus, nearly didn't return: he told of being pursued by an orc riding a nightmarish flying beast.\nIn the last few days we stopped watching the mountains. Instead, we took pick and shovel once more, shoulder to shoulder with the dwarfs, digging multiple firing lines. Only narrow slits were left for the muzzles of our muskets, arranged so that we could fire over the heads of the men in the first rank and all unleash volleys together. We also raised mounds of stone and earth, makeshift forts where the artillery was emplaced to dominate the entire pass. When the orcs came charging, they would have to run through the fire of dozens —perhaps hundreds— of cannons. No one knew the exact number: the guns of the Imperial army stood alongside dwarf artillery and newly forged pieces, like multi-barrel cannons.\nWe worked without rest for days until finally everything was ready. That very night, we were given double rations. It was the unmistakable sign: battle was coming. It had always been the same, even back in Reikland —when a great beastman assault loomed, the officers made sure we filled our bellies early, rather than starve in the middle of a fight with no end in sight.\nThe priests of Sigmar spent hours chanting prayers, blessing trenches, weapons, and banners. Some soldiers crossed themselves, others prayed in silence, others just stared at the ground in resignation. We only rested when ordered to take our positions. My company was placed in the second trench, well supplied: we had crates of ammunition, packets of powder, and cartridges ready to reload as fast as possible.\nEach man loaded his musket and left it primed for the first shot. From our position we could see the infantry of Sigmar's clergy taking their places in the first line, lower down, ready to withstand the first impact of the greenskins. To our right, the Prince of Marienburg had deployed his personal troops. There stood his veterans hardened in a thousand battles, alongside two full regiments of pikemen and musketeers.We watched as hundreds of the prince's riders vanished into the pass, gone for several minutes.\n\"How many do you think there are?\" Lukas asked nervously, watching the pass, where silence ruled like a shroud.\n\"Who knows,\" I replied. \"Just that there must be many… but we must trust we'll hold.\"\n\"Yeah, they must be exaggerating. Sure there are a lot, but I guess from high up on a pegasus they can't really count them well,\" Lukas said, trying to force a smile.\n\"They can't be that many… look, the riders are coming back,\" I pointed, noticing a small rock rolling down the slope. But the movement didn't stop: soon larger ones shifted, until the earth itself began to tremble.\n\"Ready! Everyone to your posts, muskets primed to fire!\" shouted one of our officers, running along the trench as the men in the front lines took their positions. Soldiers adjusted their ear protectors, artillery crews lit their spare fuses, and the cavalry pulled back, forming up on the right flank alongside the forces of the Prince of Marienburg.\nSuddenly, small groups of orcs appeared.\"They're shouting…\" I muttered, watching them raise their weapons into the air as they descended a steep hillside. At first it was only a few dozen… until behind them, as if the earth itself had split open, thousands more came pouring down. The cacophony of their cries bounced off the mountains, a roar that grew ever more deafening.\"Shit!\" I blurted, slipping on my ear protection.\nIn a matter of seconds, the entire pass was covered in greenskins. Left to right, right to left, wherever you looked, orcs were streaming down the hill, packed shoulder to shoulder, filling the valley completely. The vibrations in the ground grew so strong the earth trembled under our feet.\nThe thunder of cannons erupted across the field as I saw huge shots tearing through the air, slamming into the greenskin ranks, killing hundreds and gouging enormous wounds in their formations —wounds that were quickly filled again. The cannons boomed and boomed, slaughtering the orcs and goblins without pause, piling their corpses into growing mounds.\nSoon one artillery position roared louder than the rest: many of the repeater cannons unleashed storms of lead that ripped apart the vanguard of the greenskins in staggering numbers. For several minutes it was only the artillery carrying the slaughter, cutting down the enemy in droves —yet still the tide swelled. They were halfway down the slope already, and there seemed no end to them.\nOur officer raised his hand, giving the signal to fire. In the next heartbeat, every line of musketeers opened up at once. Thousands of greenskins fell under that first volley. As we reloaded, massive shapes began to emerge from the horde: trolls and giants striding through their ranks.\nAlmost every cannon swung toward them, firing with precision. Some collapsed quickly, their chests and faces torn apart by dozens of heavy rounds, but others lumbered on, unstoppable, crashing into the Sigmarite troops. Cannons loaded with grapeshot poured a deadly rain over the orcs, ripping through flesh and bone —and still they pressed forward, heedless of the immense losses.\nWe fired again. More orcs toppled in heaps, and the mounds of bodies rose high enough to block parts of the pass. At last, the green tide slammed into the Prince of Marienburg's men and the forces of Sigmar's clergy. Spearmen, pikemen, and halberdiers locked themselves in brutal melee with the orcs, who struck with uncontrollable fury. From our trenches, we kept firing into the endless horde pouring down the hillside, though it grew harder and harder not to hit our own allies.\nCannons thundered, muskets spat fire and lead, and whole mountains of bodies formed around us. Grapeshot shredded the greenskins, giants fell to cannon fire. I watched trolls hurl themselves at the clergy's ranks, only to be met by priests who crushed them with their blessed hammers, golden auras blazing through the blood.\nI lost count of how many times I had reloaded. Our vanguard was beginning to give ground, forced back slowly by the green tide, pushing closer to our trenches. It made aiming all the harder —shooting without hitting our own men was nearly impossible.\nThen the warning we'd been given became real: a massive winged beast soared over the battlefield, ridden by a colossal orc. For a moment we just stared, and the greenskins roared louder at the sight, their fury renewed.\nAfter another volley of musket fire, we realized the flying monster was coming straight at us. Not toward the packed front lines —directly at our trenches and the artillery. Panic spread as many tried to flee its path, clogging the reload crews.\nThe beast was about to crash down upon us when something dived from the heavens at breakneck speed. A figure struck the monster mid-air, and we saw two enormous creatures tearing at each other as they plummeted. Roars and shrieks shook the battlefield until, as they dropped lower, I recognized our griffon: it was locked in a titanic struggle with the flying beast.\nThey crashed with a thunderous impact. The griffon managed to steady itself, landing heavily with a beating of wings, while the orc-beast smashed into the ground, its neck torn in half. The massive orc rider staggered to his feet, weapon in hand… only for our lord's griffon to land beside him. Then we saw our general's mighty mace crush the brute's skull, bursting it into a thousand pieces across the blood-soaked earth.\nWithout pause, he took to the skies again, diving straight into the thick of battle to aid the men.\nWe quickly regained ground as the vanguard pushed the orcs back. The giants could not reach our lines before being blasted apart, and the greenskins failed to break the Empire's steel formations. Soon they began to falter. Many still charged blindly, but others broke and ran, making it far easier to hold the line.\nAll our cannons and musket ranks kept firing relentlessly, until at last the greenskins broke completely and fled en masse. It wasn't long before thousands of riders surged in pursuit, led by our lord on his griffon, tearing into the stragglers with claws and beak.\nIt didn't take long before we all began shouting:\n\"We've won!\" I cried in elation, watching our cavalry run down the fleeing remnants.\nThe celebration swept across the front. All around us men cheered the great victory, while Sigmarite priests and warriors rushed to evacuate the wounded from the front lines, and even began gathering the dead to grant them their sacred rites.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------\nThe source of this content ɪs ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet",

After hours of brutal combat, the victory was finally ours. The orc warlord had fallen beneath my mace in single combat, and with his death the courage of his host crumbled. Without a clear leader, greenskins are nothing but cowardly beasts, always waiting for a new chieftain to gather them.\nI never gave them the chance. As soon as they began their rout, I hurled my cavalry into pursuit. They still outnumbered us, but in their desperate flight they failed to realize that if they had turned and faced us once more, they might have overwhelmed us. Instead, they plunged headlong into a stampede that stretched from our fortress pass all the way to their camp. It was a tide of orcs and goblins the likes of which had not been seen in years. Such a concentration could only be explained by the influence of their gods, for it was impossible that so many would gather without a greater purpose.\nNow almost all of them lie dead. The entire valley blazes with funeral pyres where the bodies of orcs, goblins, trolls, and giants burn. The latter were the hardest to move: it took the strength of dozens of men to drag each corpse to the fires.\nThe dawi had already begun their work, deploying their ingenious steam machines to purge the spores of the greenskins. With dwarfen discipline and enough time, every hill, every karak, and every mountain of the region would be cleansed of that insidious threat.\nMy soldiers, though victorious, did not come through unscathed. Casualties were limited, but the wounded were many: bones shattered by the monstrous strength of trolls and orcs, limbs torn by their crude weapons. I could not employ my magic to reinforce their armor without exposing myself; and though I mastered it, I dared not reveal my gifts before inevitably receiving the Patriarch's letter, demanding I present myself to the Colleges to be examined and caged into one of their schools.\nI had planned to remain three months in the fortress, to reinforce it and give the men rest. But with an army of forty-two thousand already mobilized, sending them back to Reinsfeld or Marienburg would have been a waste. I could not squander such a force. My eyes were set further south, on the Border Princes.\nThere blood never ceases to flow; forever trapped in their petty wars. Yet their position is key: from those lands one reaches the most important Karaks of Karak Ankor. And their population, enslaved to petty lords and endless conflicts, could be brought into the Westerlands. Millions of new souls, added to the surviving Bretonnians in Parravon, would make my domains the most populous province of the Empire. All this, besides preventing those defenseless people from falling into the hands of the Ruinous Powers, when inevitably some champion of Chaos set his eyes on them.\n\"You must be very pleased with your victory, aren't you?\" said Katarin, mounted on her horse as she looked over the fields of greenskin corpses slowly turning to ash in the dawi pyres.\n\"Bah… this is no victory. I don't know where in damnation so many greenskins came from; there weren't supposed to be such numbers in this region. Something must have driven them to gather in one place. Truly, this is no victory, for this battle should never have happened. We lost men, and giving the news to their families is always the hardest part.\"\n\"So, now we return to Altdorf? Or shall we head to Marienburg to review the arms shipments that should reach Kislev once the northern railway is finished?\" asked Katarin, her voice like ice.\n\"None of that. We march south. We have the army gathered here, and we cannot waste it. We will conduct a summer campaign in the lands of the Border Princes. We must secure a route to Karaz-a-Karak in case of future campaigns in the region, as well as facilitate trade with our dawi allies. So we will not return for at least several months, perhaps until next year, depending on how long the princes resist our invasion,\" I replied, removing my helm.\n\"Great… more nights in a tent,\" Katarin said with heavy sarcasm. \"I hope at least the weather is colder. This volcanic region, where magma bursts forth so often, is unbearable to me. I cannot use my magic at all; even my teachers would struggle to invoke the simplest spell here.\"\n\"I doubt you'll be sleeping in tents for long, Katarin. There will be castles taken, that is certain. The princes rarely unite against an invader; most prefer to kill each other. So it will most likely be a short campaign, visiting castles and cities to demand surrender —or a single great battle against their forces. Either option is preferable to a guerrilla war, which would be far more troublesome to face.\"\n\"Ahh… fine. Let's hope it doesn't drag on too long. Because I remember you said you wanted to help with the cleansing of Kislev… or am I mistaken?\" Katarin asked, her eyes as cold as her tone.\n\"Yes, but I expected a far more modest commitment from the clergy. I never thought they would mobilize tens of thousands of their troops or pay out of their own coffers for the fortress construction. At most, I thought I could persuade them to garrison it. And yet, here they are: funding everything, fielding an army, and offering their finest men to guard the place. That leaves me free to march south without delay.\"\nKatarin rolled her eyes in impatience before letting out a heavy sigh. \"I only hope you make the time to aid Kislev. The help of your army would be vital to reclaim our lands from the mutants and invaders occupying vast stretches of the motherland. Every day we fail to drive them out is another day of harm to Kislev,\" she said gravely.\n\"And that day will come, Katarin. But I cannot let this opportunity slip away. What you ask means marching my army back to Altdorf —several days' travel— then taking the train to wherever the line is finished, marching north, reaching Kislev, acclimating the men for weeks and issuing winter uniforms before even beginning to move into the combat zone. By the time that happens, we'd already be well into the year.\nHere, on the other hand, we need only march two days to strike the first city of the Princes. It's not that I don't want to help your father, Katarin —it's simply that this is cheaper, faster, and yields long-term gains.\"\nBefore she could reply, I continued: \"And those benefits, in the long run, will also aid Kislev.\"Katarin finally nodded and returned to her escort.\nWe quickly began talks with the Cult of Sigmar, mainly regarding the management of the fortress. Being a key point for trade, its administration would directly affect Averland, whose Elector Countess already showed little enthusiasm for the idea of Imperial centralization. If we ceded to the clergy the right to collect tolls, we would put her against us immediately.\nFor that reason, I struck a different deal with the Grand Theogonist: I would cover the costs of defense and supply for the fortress, in exchange for the clergy refraining from charging tolls. In this way, the Elector Countess would keep her revenues intact, and the Cult would content itself with a permanent military presence in the area. It did not cost me much: barely two hundred thousand gold crowns per year. A modest sum considering that, in return, I would have the permanent vigilance of ten thousand warriors of the Cult, guarding the pass and protecting merchants against possible greenskin resurgences or the rise of bandits, who would no doubt rush to fill the void left by the orcs' defeat.\nSeveral days passed since we last saw a greenskin in the region. The dawi continued their work, flamethrowers in hand, burning every crevice, every cavern, and every suspicious stone, making sure to eradicate even the smallest chance that the spores survived. They would soon begin reclaiming the local fortresses, one by one.\nIt was then that we began preparations to march south. I sent the gravely wounded back to Reinsfeld; too many of the fallen had come from my city. They were the only ones with the discipline and resolve to stand firm before the green tide. Had I placed Altdorf's recruits in the first line, they would surely have broken and fled, had I not kept them at the rear.\nI made sure the news of deaths was delivered, along with the pensions owed for each soldier's loyal service. I also included them in the future shares of campaign spoils. It was the least I could do for those families who had given everything under my banner.\nSo we prepared the equipment, broke camp, checked the weapons, and secured the gunpowder. At the same time, I began sending orders to my laboratories to keep supplies moving south, for after the last battle my reserves were running low. With what we had, we could sustain only a few hours of combat, no more.\nWhen everything was ready, the columns formed and soon we set out with more than forty thousand men marching south. I sent a letter to the Emperor to inform him of my plans and to ensure he would answer any diplomatic complaints that might arise while I was on campaign.\nOur first stop was Vossheim, a merchant settlement overflowing with refugees from the Border Princes. In truth, it could scarcely be called a town: a camp of tents with only a few buildings belonging to traders dealing between the Empire, the Princes, and the dawi.\nOur arrival was greeted with enthusiasm by the merchants, eager to sell their trinkets. Yet we soon discovered that some offered supposed sacred relics of Sigmar. As they emanated no divine energy, it was clear they were forgeries. We swiftly captured and tried them: if genuine, their sale was illegal; if false, it was fraud in the name of the Cult. In either case, the sentence was the same. All were executed and their goods seized —a boon for us, since several were local food suppliers.\nThe rest of the population, those who were not merchants, were sent under escort to the Westerlands. A detachment of my men ensured they were guided along and prevented from escaping.\nBy nightfall we raised camp once more, and once the gunpowder shipment we had requested arrived, we resumed our march. We crossed the Black Fire Pass and entered the territory of the Princes.\nIt did not take long before we came across small villages, where men, women, and children plowed the earth and sowed seeds. \"Take them captive and avoid harming them too much,\" I ordered my men-at-arms. The cavalry galloped toward the hamlets, surrounding the families who tried to flee in vain. My army pressed southward, ignoring the cries of the captured peasants.\nThus we proceeded in every settlement we encountered along the road to our first objective: a walled town supposedly still ruled by a prince. It was hard to be certain; in such places betrayal is so common that a lord seldom keeps power for long before being stabbed in the back.\nOur destination was Munzig, a fortified city claimed by the Empire as its own, though the local count held power and paid no tribute to the Emperor —neither in men nor in gold. In practice, an independent city, and therefore, an easy target.\nAs soon as we reached its outskirts, we saw the people fleeing in panic toward the walls. Some of my cavalry continued to seize stragglers as my army deployed in formation before the city. Then I advanced on my griffon toward the gates, ready to begin negotiations for the town's surrender —or to smash its walls with artillery, which would not take long.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------Thɪs updatᴇd by Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt",

They cried out desperately to be let in, but it was clear no one would open them.\nTaking my banner, I advanced slowly with my griffon toward the gates. On the walls, crossbowmen and a few handgunners lined up, while the peasants trapped at the foot of the ramparts scattered in panic, trying to escape my cavalry, which surrounded the city but remained just outside the range of enemy projectiles. My men busied themselves capturing them one by one.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar!\" I shouted with all the strength in my lungs, making my voice echo against the stone. \"I am General Albrecht von Reinsfeld, Elector Count of the Westerlands and Prince of Marienburg. In the name of the Chosen of Sigmar, Emperor Luitpold, I demand the immediate and unconditional surrender of the city. If you do not comply with my terms before the sun reaches its highest point, my cannons will reduce your walls to dust, and no mercy will be shown. Open the gates and you will be spared.\"\nAfter proclaiming my ultimatum, I withdrew to my lines as my troops encircled the city completely. The marching column was catching up, and soon every gate was guarded, reinforced by detachments of infantry and cavalry. Among them shuffled the peasants captured earlier, to be sent and resettled in the Westerlands.\nNew defenders appeared on the ramparts, and with a quick reading of my arcane gifts, I estimated they numbered barely five hundred. For a successful assault against a walled city, a ratio of ten to one is recommended. We exceeded that figure with ease. Everything now depended on the sanity of the local graf.\nAfter a few minutes, standards appeared over the main gate. I distinguished men in full armor, a clear sign that their lord had come forth. I advanced again on my griffon, the banner waving at my side. Bolts and bullets concerned me little: with a simple gesture of Chamon's magic, I could deflect them.\n\"I am Graf von Erhard,\" proclaimed the noble from the wall. \"General of the Empire, why do you bring the Emperor's forces to the gates of my city, when I am a faithful servant of Sigmar?\"\n\"You fool no one, graf,\" I replied, raising my voice. \"Munzig has gone years without paying tribute and has never answered the Emperor's calls to arms. Surely you do not give fealty to the Chosen of Sigmar, and thus you are nothing more than a secessionist rebel. Give me your answer: immediate surrender or the destruction of your walls and your head on my banners.\"\n\"I am willing to pay the overdue taxes and provide men to the state armies, as Imperial law dictates. There is no need to spill blood among sons of the Empire,\" the noble answered.\n\"That was not among my options, rebel. If by noon you have not surrendered your city, my cannons will open fire and no negotiation will be possible,\" I retorted, pulling away.\nI ordered the artillery pieces deployed before the walls so they could see I was serious. Barely ten minutes passed before the gate began to open. The defenders cast down their weapons, and behind them the townsfolk poured out en masse, resignation written on their faces.\n\"Well then, we now have a roof over our heads,\" I told my men, who entered the city immediately under my command.\nThe process of changing hands began at once. Fortunately, the region's culture was close to that of Averland, which would ease its full integration into my lands. I ordered a controlled plunder: only the granaries and the city treasury were to be seized, everything else left in the hands of its owners. I had no intention of setting the poor example of betraying those who surrendered without a fight.\nThat, however, did not spare them from resettlement. Soon my men were loading carts with belongings, forcing the entire population to prepare for relocation to my domains in the Westerlands. The city would remain as a base of operations for my army.\nThe only ones exempt from forced relocation were the merchants, since their presence would prove useful in following the host, providing supplies during the campaign against the other princes.\nWhile the city descended into chaos and people heaped their belongings onto carts, I sensed a group moving through secret tunnels beneath my feet. I could feel full suits of armor scraping against stone, fleeing far from the city.\nI entered the castle, built upon a fortified hill, and designated it as my new staging point for controlling the lands of the Border Princes. The treasury had been partially looted: it was clear someone had tried to carry off as much wealth as possible, though they had managed to move little. Chests lay overturned, piles of gold coins scattered as if abandoned in haste.\n\"Well, my dear betrothed, as promised you no longer need to sleep in a campaign tent. Now you have all the chambers of this castle at your disposal, to choose whichever you like and transform it with your ice magic,\" I said to Katarin, who entered accompanied by her escort.\n\"That was… very quick,\" she remarked, taking in the decorations of the former lord as she walked through the hall.\n\"We vastly outnumbered them, what can I say? The graf had common sense… or simply fled like a dog. Either way, the city is ours. Now we have solid walls and a well-defended castle. Though its population was only about eight thousand, and much of the army will have to camp outside, we at least have a safe refuge should anything go wrong,\" I replied while studying local maps, drawn by the graf to navigate this ever-changing region.\n\"So what comes next?\" asked Katarin, standing behind me to look over the maps.\n\"Akendorf, the great trading city of the region, will be my next objective. In the meantime, my forces will scatter to capture all the local inhabitants and relocate them to the Westerlands,\" I replied firmly.\n\"I don't understand why you're so interested in that. Why do you want to take them all back to your lands instead of leaving them here? They could work just as well, and you'd keep both the land and the territory,\" Katarin countered, her gaze fixed on the map.\n\"This region is prey to constant Chaos incursions from the east and greenskin invasions. Their fate is usually to become slaves of cultists, sacrifices, cannon fodder, or food for the orcs. Its natural defenses are decent, but no fortress—no one wants to pay to defend everyone else. There are three main passes: the Silver Road, watched by the dawi, though now they're busy reclaiming their Karaks; Mag-Dog Pass, crawling with greenskins, without a single wall to hold them back; and farther south, a great river, narrow and without bridges, acting as a natural barrier but left unguarded. And lastly, there's Death Pass, teeming with greenskins, where only Barak Varr holds the line… guarding their river zone, and as always, the dawi limit themselves to protecting their own,\" I explained, pointing to each pass on the maps.\n\"In Kislev we tried to do the same,\" Katarin replied with a sigh. \"But many of our fortresses are lost and now occupied by the very things we tried to prevent.\"\n\"And one more little secret: if my army were crushed, I could hardly rebuild it. So every person we bring back with us is a potential recruit,\" I said, watching her.\n\"How? Don't you have Marienburg as a recruitment hub?\" she asked.\n\"Of course, I can always conscript, but that hurts the cities' economy. And if the economy collapses, it affects everyone's pockets, and in the end damages the entire military chain. It's not viable. Instead, this is the chance to increase my revenues in my provinces and, at the same time, ensure that in the event of a sudden invasion there won't be a catastrophe with the population. I'll make sure this whole region becomes heavily fortified, and when some Imperial noble seeks to become Elector Count of these lands, he'll find nothing but a military province, totally dependent on the capital to survive.\"\n\"Well… that makes more sense now. But doesn't it cause you problems to take people by force?\" Katarin asked.\n\"Maybe. But for now, I've only resettled Bretonnians. And Sigmar bless them, they are the most loyal folk you could ask for. They work themselves to exhaustion with a smile, and strive to learn Reikspiel. So far, I can only say I've had good experiences with them. They're obedient, hardworking, and Sigmar's clergy is already educating them into becoming fervent followers of the God of Humanity,\" I answered with a smile.\n\"Although it's also been shown that he can be a rather troublesome god… he almost got me killed,\" she muttered, lips pursed in a faint grimace.\n\"Yes, sometimes… I won't deny it. But well, Katarin, if you like you can help my captains keep order. I must march at once toward Akendorf. The quicker I act, the better. As long as I keep surprise on my side, the better the results,\" I said, folding the latest maps and leaving the castle to take command of my men for the next campaign.\nI departed as I had arrived, watching the chaos in the city as more groups of peasants were herded by my soldiers to be transported to the Westerlands.\nOnce on the march, I gathered a force of some thirty thousand men heading south. We seized every village we encountered along the way, and soon captured a pair of castles in the same fashion: offering immediate surrender. This time there were no secret tunnels, and the lords surrendered without resistance, knowing they were utterly outmatched.\nFor an hour we continued the march, though my forces diminished to twenty-eight thousand men. It was inevitable: leaving garrisons in castles and guards for the peasants required rear detachments. Still, the column advanced steadily, and the campaign had only just begun.\nAs we descended following the river's course, we soon reached a bridge where tolls were being collected—but of course, the guards fled the moment they saw us. Our presence would not go unnoticed in the city.\nWe crossed the river swiftly and continued on, passing merchants who looked on with satisfaction at the fact they no longer had to pay tolls to cross the bridge; they only had to wait for my forces to finish crossing.Thɪs updatᴇd by\nAs we pressed forward, I once again dispatched detachments to seize villages and round up the local population. After crossing the bridge, we began to glimpse the great city rising before us.\nAkendorf, known as the largest city of the Border Princes, lived up to its reputation. Vast, with strong walls around its heart and sprawling outer districts that revealed a dense, plentiful population, ripe for subjugation.\nAs we approached, people began scattering toward the walls seeking refuge. We gave them little time: at once we raised our siege camp and deployed the many cannons where all could see them, showing that we were ready to reduce the city to rubble if it resisted.\nThe population rushed inside the city, and soon emissaries were spotted advancing toward our lines. They carried flags of truce, sent to negotiate\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Meanwhile, my men continued the preparations for the siege. Akendorf, the largest city in the region, would not surrender easily: its population was far too numerous, which meant a wide militia surely ready to fight. I was convinced this would be neither quick nor simple. I might even have to resort to my Chamon sorcery to ensure a crushing victory before time turned against my army.\nThe envoys soon drew near, though their horses grew restless under the presence of my griffon, which snorted deeply and beat its wings with impatience.\n\"Greetings, noble of the Empire. Our prince asks what business brings you into his lands,\" said the emissary in a conciliatory tone, trying to sound firm despite the tension in his voice.\n\"The Empire seeks to secure trade routes with our dawi allies, and you are in the way. Akendorf must swear fealty to the Emperor and open its gates so this city may become the base of operations for the Imperial army in this region,\" I answered firmly, making it clear this was not a request but a command.\n\"Akendorf is a sovereign state, general. We have resisted many conquerors and will not yield our independence. The confederation of northern princes will not tolerate an Imperial intrusion here, so I advise you to withdraw at once,\" the emissary replied, attempting to sound defiant.\n\"And will that confederation arrive before my cannons smash your walls to rubble and my army slaughters your entire population?\" I asked, raising my arm to point at the artillery being positioned in front of the gates.\n\"Well… if the walls hold, our people will remain loyal to their prince,\" the emissary responded, though the tremor in his words betrayed him.\n\"These walls were not built to withstand cannon fire. They will collapse within hours. Tell your prince I am willing to spare his life if he surrenders immediately. But if he refuses, and I capture him alive, he will regret every cursed second of his resistance. You have until the cannons are ready to give me your answer,\" I said, letting my voice echo against the battlements.\nThe emissary shook his head, turned his horse, and returned toward the city gates, which slammed shut with a metallic crash. More defenders appeared atop the walls: soldiers, militiamen, even peasants armed with spears, all taking their positions. This was to be a true battle. I estimated their numbers easily surpassed ten thousand, ready to fight to the last breath.\nI knew, however, that Akendorf was technologically backward. The Empire did not sell cannons to the Border Princes, and what little they had were smuggled pieces or rusted antiques. At best, they possessed a handful of arquebuses scattered along the walls. Nothing comparable to a modern Imperial army.\nI watched as my engineers deployed the artillery. Eighty cannons were aligned and aimed at three separate sections of the walls. Their iron mouths, like hungry beasts, awaited the order to fire. The city that had stood proud for centuries was about to feel the weight of Imperial blackpowder.\nThe absence of a reply from the prince, and the swelling number of defenders on the walls, confirmed the obvious: they planned to resist to the end.\n\"Commence the bombardment,\" I finally ordered.\nThe roar was deafening. The earth shook as the first salvo struck Akendorf's walls. I myself guided the projectiles with the lore of Chamon, focusing the impacts on precise spots to hasten the collapse. Stones splintered, entire blocks broke loose, and defenders fled from the battered sections to avoid being buried.\nAkendorf could not return fire. They could only watch helplessly as wave after wave of projectiles shattered their battlements, abandoning the most devastated sections to avoid being crushed beneath their own defenses.\nMeanwhile, my men sealed every gate of the city. Palisades were raised, trenches dug, and a sea of tents unfurled around the fortress-city. Akendorf was completely surrounded.\nAs the relentless pounding continued, the first cracks began to spread like black veins across the stonework. The echo of each shot thundered through the nearby valleys, and a cloud of dust rose like a gray fog above Akendorf.\nFor several hours, the cannons roared without pause. Each salvo was concentrated on specific points, and with every impact the fractures spread wider, weakening the masonry. For now, the city itself remained intact: all the artillery's fury was focused on the outer defenses.\nAt last, a section of wall gave way. With a thunderous crash, massive blocks of stone tumbled down like miniature hills, crushing defenders who had failed to retreat in time. The wall collapsed before the helpless eyes of its guardians, opening the first breach.\nAt the signal, I sent several thousand musketeers forward, covered by massive portable barricades of reinforced timber. These mobile shields were planted firmly in the ground before the breach, advancing step by step under a rain of arrows and bolts from the walls. Men sheltered behind oak planks, opening slits and gaps from which to fire.\nSoon, the air filled with the acrid stench of gunpowder, and the sound of musketry became a constant thunder. Lead shot found its mark: defenders toppled from the battlements with torn bodies, rolling among the rubble. The defense from within the city was fierce, but it grew ever costlier for them.\nThen another section of the walls gave way. The bombardment had done its work, and an entire stretch collapsed violently, raising a dust cloud so thick it hid both sides from sight for a few moments. When it cleared, a mountain of rubble marked the new entrance into the city.\nAt once I sent more companies to occupy the breach, dividing the defenders' attention. Some of the cannons, no longer having clear targets, were redirected toward the battlements. Their shots tore away parapets, lesser towers, and men alike—though it was clear that every projectile striking high could slaughter combatants and civilians without distinction.\nSlowly, yet steadily, the fighting dragged on until the sun began to sink. I did not wish to overstrain my recruits; many still lacked the experience to endure a prolonged siege. Once the final skirmishes subsided, I ordered all forces back to camp. It was time to rest, reorganize the ranks, and tend to the wounded.\nFortune was on our side: we had abundant potions from the Cult of Shallya, allowing most minor wounds to be treated swiftly. The majority were cuts or impacts to arms and legs, the areas most exposed when firing from behind the mobile palisades we used in the assault.\nThe night passed with relative calm. Thanks to my ring, I had little need of sleep, so I spent most of the hours watching the walls of Akendorf. By torchlight I saw the defenders at work, hastily raising an improvised wall where their stone ramparts had collapsed earlier that day. Their obstinacy was admirable, but also desperate.\nWhat did trouble me was what I saw in the nearby forest: a large host of goblins moving in our rear. They had taken advantage of the noise and chaos of the fighting to creep close without detection. Their numbers seemed considerable, enough to put me in a dilemma: turn back and secure the rear, or launch a full assault on the city, using the lore of Chamon to carve a path through before we were trapped between two enemies.\nWith the first light of morning, as the troops were already preparing to resume the attack, one of my guards rushed to me.\n\"My lord, the envoy from the city of Akendorf requests an audience with you,\" he said, containing his surprise.\n\"So at last they've come to beg?\" I replied, rising from the chair where I had passed the night, and headed to the camp's entrance. There a group of riders awaited, the emissary at their head. This time I approached without my griffon, though I remained wary.\n\"What is it? Have they surrendered already?\" I asked, studying them closely.\n\"May I know your name, good sir?\" said the envoy, holding something hidden beneath cloth.\n\"Albrecht von Reinsfeld,\" I answered coldly, my eyes fixed on what he carried. It seemed to be an object of gold, some ceremonial ornament.\n\"My lord,\" the emissary continued, dismounting and unveiling what he bore, \"the electoral council of Akendorf offers you the crown of the city and recognizes your right to become our new lord.\" He bowed deeply, extending the golden crown as a symbol of submission.\n\"What in Sigmar's name…? Have you murdered your prince?\" I asked, half incredulous, half angered.\n\"No… we would never do such a thing,\" he replied solemnly. \"Our lord, Lord Rillian, suffered a mishap during supper. Something in the food disagreed with him, and he died during the night. No one could save him.\"\nI took the crown in one hand, though I did not place it upon my head. I held it for a moment, weighing the farce being played before me.\n\"Then I accept the city's submission. Let all defenders come out and cast down their arms, and I will show mercy to those who until yesterday fought against us,\" I declared firmly.\nThe riders nodded, turned their horses, and galloped back toward the city.\n\"Damn it… did you see that?\" I muttered to my guards. \"Not even a day has passed, and they've slain their own lord to save themselves. Perhaps it isn't such a good idea to bring these people back to the Westerlands, as I had planned. Who knows what they would do in my lands, if this is how they treat their prince?\"\nMy men gave no reply. Yet their faces showed the same mixture of surprise and distrust that gnawed at me.\n\"I think they're going to be trouble, my lord. At least the Bretonnians are loyal… but this rabble… I wouldn't trust them with anything,\" said one of my men-at-arms, spitting to the side with contempt.\n\"Yes… nor would I. Better not. Send a rider to the forces in Averland and have them bring back all the captives. If we are to use them at all, it will be to squeeze their labor here in this region, but nothing more. Too risky to give them access to my farms. Still… send a message to the Emperor as well: I want all the peasants of Parravon delivered at once. If the harvest is good, we'll have abundant food in the Empire and will be able to sustain a much larger group of peasants,\" I answered calmly, my words met with nods of agreement.\n\"Yes, my lord,\" two of my guards replied in unison before spurring their horses northward to halt the caravans of prisoners.\n\"What shall we do with the city now, my lord?\" one of my captains asked, approaching with a grave look.\n\"We'll spare the lower classes,\" I replied without hesitation. \"The nobles, however, will be charged with regicide and executed for it. I cannot overlook what they've done: to abandon or betray their lord is something that corrodes the foundations of any realm. Had I more time, I would have rejected their surrender outright… but we are pressed now. So this once we will act swiftly and take the city.\"\nUpon returning to camp, I tossed the golden crown onto the mound of hides where my griffon lay. She lifted her head from the pile, loosed a low growl, and the moment she saw the glittering object, snapped it up in her beak. With a sharp crack she began shaking it from side to side, as if it were no more than a toy.\n\"Well, at least the Princess is pleased with her new plaything,\" I muttered, watching the beast toy with Akendorf's symbol of power as though it were nothing but a piece of shiny scrap.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Sigmar would never look kindly upon men who murdered their own lord the very moment all seemed lost… Push him,\" I ordered, raising my hand with a sharp gesture.\nMy men obeyed without hesitation. The noble barely managed a desperate \"No!\" before he was shoved into the void. The rope snapped taut with a harsh crack, and his body kicked wildly in the air until the movement ceased.\nTurning back, I gazed at Akendorf's main street. The stone façades of noble houses and wealthy merchants were now decorated with hanging corpses. Each window served as a gallows, every rope swayed like a macabre banner to remind every inhabitant of the fate reserved for traitors. I ordered the heralds to march through the city proclaiming that all had been executed for treason and regicide.\nThe work had not been difficult: one of those wretches had rushed to confess that he himself had poisoned the prince, hoping I would reward him with a political post. He incriminated himself—and sealed the fate of all the nobility in the process. The poison, a lethal extract from local fungi, had been the tool. All I had to do was tie the threads and accuse the rest of conspiracy, giving them no room to maneuver. In a city with an elective monarchy, those parasites thought I would buy them off with gold and titles for having \"elected\" me as their new prince. They forgot that I needed no such approval: I had been on the verge of taking the city by force.\nEliminating the nobility in a single stroke brought another advantage: I avoided a civil bloodbath. With no leaders pushing them to resist, the inhabitants submitted without further slaughter. The price was harsh for knights and merchants, but merciful for the common folk. I granted them a quick death rather than leaving them to rot in dungeons.\nAkendorf, though its walls lay ruined by bombardment, was a vital strategic point. With the city under my control, the road to Karaz-a-Karak was open. Now I could fulfill my word to High King Thorgrim: to plan a railway linking the Empire with the heart of Karak Ankor, easing both trade and the reconquest of Dwarf strongholds. But first, I had to secure the region.\nThe locals warned me that the nearby forests were infested with beastmen and countless goblin tribes. Further south stood Styratia, a city of similar size to Akendorf, but far harder to subdue. They shared neither tongue nor faith: their people descended from ancient clans, closer to the Zani herdsmen than to any Imperial, Tilean, or Estalian culture. There, resistance would be both military and cultural.\nStill, my first task was not to march to another war, but to relocate the population. I would not leave thousands of people at the mercy of the next invasion that would inevitably ravage the villages on the way to the Empire. They had to be moved to a defensible place where they could serve, in time, as loyal subjects—and, if need be, as soldiers for future campaigns.\nThus I resolved: the people must be moved out of harm's way. To do so, I needed to find a more defensible region, a place where thousands could settle without fear of being destroyed by the first army to cross the land.\nStudying the map, my attention fixed on a vast woodland lying along the most direct route toward the High King's domains. The problem was obvious: those forests crawled with goblins. Yet if we could cleanse them and establish settlements there, we could turn them into a natural bastion, reinforced with fortifications capable of withstanding any assault. I envisioned walls as formidable as those at Black Fire Pass, a fortress that would force any warlord to think twice before crossing.\nIt was a pragmatic decision: before invading further principalities and stretching my army across distant towns, I needed to secure a solid core. A zone to house the conquered population and provide, at the same time, a durable base of operations.\nIt did not take long to organize the march. The army moved out, escorting caravans full of people, and we began to do what we did best: cleanse the forests. Wherever a goblin camp was found, artillery and muskets spoke first; then the cavalry swept up the remains.\nAt the same time, I sent messengers to Karaz-a-Karak with a clear request for the High King Thorgrim: I needed his aid. If the Dawi brought their flamethrowers\nwe could purge the goblin-infested forests once and for all. Only then would the area be truly secure, and the project of a direct railway between the Empire and Karak Ankor become reality.\nA vast section of the forest burned out of control. That part had been smothered in the dense webs of giant spiders, the horrid beasts goblins breed like horses. Those webs, as flammable as the finest oil, turned the woods into a colossal pyre. Meanwhile, I advanced alone through another sector, separated by a river that marked a natural border.\nMy purpose was to scout the land, to find suitable places to settle the people following me. Here I found little resistance: a handful of goblins slain by my hand since I entered, but nothing compared to the usual plague. Nor were there traces of spores or corrupting fungi. The contrast was unsettling: a forest too quiet, while on the far bank of the river hell devoured trees and greenskins alike.\nI watched as spiders, wrapped in flames, tried to flee the fire. Some leapt desperately into the water, where I struck them down with a single blow, driving steel into their skulls. One enormous spider pushed through burning trunks, its limbs toppling charred trees, but it did not get far. It collapsed onto its back, ablaze, legs thrashing like blackened branches until they stiffened, frozen toward the sky.\n\"Taal must be furious…\" I muttered, watching the fire as the winds drove it toward the mountains, spreading it further still. \"Well, this is easier than I thought. I don't understand why no one thought before to simply burn the forest.\"\nContinuing my march, I felt something that chilled me: a strong human presence.\n\"Humans? Surviving this close to goblin and spider nests? Strange… Could they be cultists?\" I thought, drawing my runic mace, alert.\nThe advance revealed something far more disturbing: well-kept fields of crops. Young wheat sprouted from the soil, vineyards stretched across nearby hills, and peasants worked calmly as if the greenskin plague had never existed. Everything was too orderly… too unnatural. And above all, I could feel a faint breath of dhar lingering in the air.\nI entered the settlement. The villagers watched me with suspicion, yet continued their tasks pretending normalcy. Still, the concentration of weapons in the place was undeniable. I could feel the weight of blades and spears before I even saw them. Guards patrolled the village… but once I looked closer, the truth became clear.\n\"Oh… zombies and skeletons. Necromancy…,\" I muttered, noticing their hollow eyes and the withered flesh beneath their armor. What was strange was the lack of dhar's usual intensity to sustain such control. Something didn't add up.\nWhen I decided to withdraw and return to my men, a dull blow struck the back of my helmet. I turned furiously, answering with an elbow that knocked down one of my attackers: a peasant armed with nothing but a stick. He wasn't alone—an entire group had tried to knock me out.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirenᴇt\n\"So… slaves of a necromancer, I see,\" I growled, raising the runic mace as the peasants, terrified, stumbled away.\nThe air thickened. Dhar surged at once, a dark current running through the settlement. The necromancer had revealed himself, and his creatures stirred.\nI drew a deep breath and let the metal obey my will. The tips of spears and swords carried by the dead warped under my magic, reshaping into floating blades. In an instant, they began to whirl as if driven by an invisible storm, slicing through rotting flesh, bone, and wood without distinction.\nI pressed forward into the village, leaving behind heaps of charred flesh and broken bone where skeletal guards and zombies had stood. Only a few twitching remnants remained, still animated by the lingering presence of dhar.\nAs I walked the streets, I noticed the villagers watching me in terror. Many bore clear marks on their necks: two precise punctures, some still fresh, with traces of dried blood on their skin. The sight was unmistakable.\n\"Damnation… a vampire. Someone marked by the curse of undeath,\" I muttered, as certainty struck me.\nRaising my hand, I drew upon Chamon to force open the gates of the castle that loomed over the settlement. With a thunderous crash, the great doors burst wide, revealing the darkened interior. From within emerged a contingent of armored warriors, the dead in motion, rising with clumsy yet determined steps to defend their master.\nI gave them no chance. With a gesture, their armor plates twisted, melting into incandescent masses of white-hot metal. The undead fell in inhuman screams, their bodies burning as the heat spread through the hall like a wild forge. In seconds, the castle's guardians were nothing but searing puddles of iron and ash.\nI advanced steadily to the last chamber. There, upon a blood-stained floor, lay an old man with a dagger buried in his stomach, breathing in ragged gasps. Around him stood several women, watching me with a mix of fear and hope. One of them stepped forward.\n\"Thank you, my lord… with your distraction we managed to kill the—\"\n\"Stay back, vampire…\" I cut her off, pointing to my Sigmarite amulet. It vibrated violently, reacting to the cursed presence.\nI was surprised how little dhar these figures gave off, as if they had learned to hide their corruption.\n\"Tsh… you're not as naïve as we thought. A lucky adventurer would have fallen easily,\" one of them said with a sharp smile, while the others began circling me like hungry wolves.\n\"It doesn't have to end this way…\" murmured another, her voice soft. \"You could join us. You could receive the gift.\"\nI circled carefully, guarding every angle, making sure none of them got behind me.\n\"Come now… don't you wish to stop worrying about tomorrow? You would live forever, if you accepted the kiss,\" pressed the first, showing her fangs under the dim light of the torches.\n\"No thanks. I've no interest in being cursed.\"\nI channeled my magic and all the metal in the hall—shattered armor, fallen weapons, nails torn from the walls—rose to float around me. In an instant, it became a storm of blazing fragments, whirling in circles to shield me from an attack on all sides.\nThe vampires struck at once, swift as shadows. Two shrieked in agony as the burning shards pierced their flesh, embedding in their bodies and roasting them from within as they clawed frantically to rip the molten steel out.\nThe other two reached me. One lunged head-on, claws aiming for my face. My mace roared as it struck her skull: a dry crack signaled the collapse of bone, her head bursting like a melon smashed in fury.\nThe other crashed upon me like a beast, claws raking at my armor. The runes flared, deflecting her strikes.\nI seized her face with my free hand, driving my fingers into her eye sockets. The creature screamed like a tortured animal, trying to bite the hand that blinded her. With the mace, I smashed her leg so brutally it shattered at once, sending her crumpling, crippled on the ground. There, with a single stomp, I crushed her skull against the stone floor, spreading dark blood like ink beneath my boots.\nOnly three abominations remained, and in their eyes no arrogance lingered—only fear. I channeled my magic again, unleashing another storm of searing metal fragments. Two stood no chance: their flesh melted as glowing shards burrowed into them, writhing and howling until they were nothing but smoking lumps of charred meat. The third chose to flee.\n\"Damn it… she slipped away,\" I growled, racing up the stairs.\nThe creature was unnaturally swift, scaling the castle in seconds. I tracked her with effort, cornering her in a shadowed chamber. There she trembled, surrounded by thralls who, with vacant eyes, offered her cups brimming with blood, heedless of what was happening around them.\n\"End of the road, vampire. The sun blazes bright… and you have no escape.\"\nShe glanced toward the window, the blinding glow of daylight, and in a desperate act clutched one of her thralls, driving her claws into his neck.\n\"We can bargain… we can…\" she stammered, her voice broken, pleading.\n\"Ha? That's pathetic. Do you really think I care what happens to one of your dogs?\" I sneered, laughter under my breath as I raised the mace.\nThe creature hurled her thrall at me. I had no qualms—my blow splattered him into a crimson painting across the stone. But the sacrifice gave her the time she needed, using her unnatural agility to hurl herself past me and out the door, leaping from the tower's heights toward the castle's entry.\nI would not let her escape. I summoned my magic, and all the metal of the gate and the castle's forges rose around her, swirling into burning blades that closed tighter and tighter. They encircled her, wrapping her in a fiery embrace of iron and flame. Her screams tore through every corner of the keep—piercing at first, then snuffed out at once into absolute silence.\n\"Well… that's settled.\"I descended the stairs with steady steps, mace still dripping with blood. \"Now to slaughter the rest of her thralls.\"\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The remains of goblins and their giant spiders lay scattered everywhere, unrecognizable, like shadows consumed by fire.\n\"The webbing burned too fast. And since the entire forest was saturated with those cursed fibers, there was no way to stop the blaze. Many of our scouts report that the goblins and spiders that survived are retreating north. To the south, however, nothing has been seen.\"\n\"Of course not…\" I replied with a grimace, omitting the fact that I myself had blocked any escape to the south, slaughtering everything that tried to flee while I moved through that zone.\n\"My men are already fighting the greenskin scum in the north. It's only a matter of time before the whole forest is cleansed, my lord,\" said one of my captains firmly.\n\"Are we certain that the entire central forest was reduced to ashes?\" I asked, stepping over charred trunks that cracked beneath my boots.\n\"All of it, my lord. The forest burned without leaving anything standing. Only a few stone ruins remain, the ones the goblins had occupied. We also found remnants of older villages… most likely destroyed decades ago when this plague first took hold of the region,\" answered a scout who had been surveying the area.\n\"Good… almost too good. I'm surprised the flames spread so quickly, but I won't complain about the results. Now that the trees are nothing but ash, we must take advantage of it. Order the charred stumps to be torn out by the root and the ground prepared. The rivers in this region should make the land fertile, and with the ash as natural fertilizer, we can turn it into farmland. The northern forest, on the other hand, must be cleared completely, while the southern one will be kept as a reserve. It will serve both as a natural barrier against invaders and as a controlled source of timber.\" I pointed at the map spread out over my mount.\n\"Do you wish us to do anything else, my lord?\" asked my captain.\n\"Yes. The entire captured population will be sent here. They will work themselves to exhaustion clearing and sowing, and with some luck we'll have the first harvest ready. If not, we can always import grain from Averland. It's not ideal, but the important thing is that this region will be secure, self-sufficient, and serve as a recruitment base for the army. Moreover, it's not located along any direct invasion route, which makes it even more valuable.\"\n\"At once, my lord!\" exclaimed the captain, bowing his head before sending messengers on horseback to gather the prisoners from Akendorf and the nearby villages. Most arrived with sour faces, driven at spearpoint, fully aware that endless toil awaited them.\nFor hours they worked at uprooting the charred trees and piling them in heaps. That dead wood would still serve a purpose: as charcoal for furnaces, as firewood for the forges, or as material for construction.\nDays passed. Thousands of my men kept sweeping through the remains of the northern forest, hunting down goblins and their spiders that had managed to flee. The campaign was a success: deprived of food, the creatures were forced out of their holes, constantly on the move, exposing themselves to ambushes by our scouts. They were doomed; it was only a matter of time before the entire plague was eradicated.\nNews from the messengers sent to High King Thorgrim soon arrived: regrettably, he could not dispatch reinforcements immediately. He was locked in a hard struggle to reclaim his Karak, his forces engaged against a stubborn greenskin resistance. Even so, he promised that if we held the region for a few more months, he would send his best warriors to help cleanse the forests.\nThe response was almost irrelevant: the wildfire had already done devastating work. The conflagration had annihilated a massive colony of goblins and their spiders; the plague was shattered, and the few bands that survived were retreating, hungry and fragmented.\nWith that relative security, the days passed at a frantic pace. Thousands of laborers arrived to set to work: charred trunks were felled and hauled away, makeshift bridges built to cross rivers and transport lumber, while work crews began raising defensive palisades at strategic points of the northern forest. The foundations of future settlements were marked out; stakes, trenches, and posts outlined the first lines of what would become fortified villages.\nProgress was swift. The scorched land was plowed with the plows seized during raids; seeds and tools were distributed among the prisoners and settlers. Everything began to function. I left Akendorf and Munzig as military centers to station my troops—especially Akendorf, where almost all my forces were concentrated.\nThe primitive tent-city in the burned forest sheltered the displaced population under strict watch. Without the need to maintain a tedious supply line back to Reinsfeld—constantly moving prisoners—the column gained mobility, and my numerical strength grew as more prisoners and settlers arrived to work.Thɪs No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nI summoned several priests of Sigmar to carry out inspections and purification rituals in the most affected areas. When I moved through certain clearings in the burned forest, my medallion vibrated insistently: there was a lingering presence of dhar in the soil, faint but real. I could not locate its source from outside, so I brought in the clerics from the fortress under construction.\nSoon the litanies and prayers began. The metallic voices of the theogonists sustained the hymns and chants of purging while peasants and prisoners gathered at a distance, uneasy at the dark currents that seemed to seep from the earth. The prayers lessened the pressure of the dhar: it was as if someone had opened a window through which foul air flowed, and the priests closed it with salt and chants.\nWith the area more under control, the project began to take shape. If I kept the people gathered and under watch, I could focus on consolidating the new territories. The plan had shifted: I no longer sought to make myself Elector Count in the strict sense—it would be wiser to install loyal vassals under my command, local administrators who would secure the region, gather resources, and above all, organize recruitment. Relying less on others' permissions to swell the ranks of the army was a practical and necessary objective.\n\"How goes it?\" I asked my dawi armorer, Grimm, who remained in his workshop beside the camp, assembling shotguns from parts he himself had forged with the help of a few dwarfs I had recruited in Altdorf. The dwarf showed a rare impatience—something unusual among his kind.\n\"Hum… it goes well,\" Grimm replied, wiping his hands with a rag. \"I've reduced the chance of the mechanism jamming and failing to fire, but we ought to think of something more permanent than this.\" He gestured toward the improvised workshop, crammed with parts, springs, and polished tubes.\n\"Tell me what you need. You know I can obtain anything within my influence in the Empire,\" I said, looking over the plans spread across the worktable.\n\"I need more competent assistants,\" Grimm grumbled. \"I cannot stand the lack of discipline of these 'half-dawi.' We may share blood, but they do not share the essence of the true dawi. Many of them ought to have taken the Slayer's Oath, for their work is that terrible… and their lack of faith in Grimnir is unbearable.\" He cast a look of disgust at the dozens of helpers shuffling parts back and forth.\n\"Are they really that bad? They seemed competent enough to me,\" I said, watching the dwarfs working in the small workshop beside the camp.\n\"To an umgi's eyes, perhaps,\" Grimm muttered, wiping his hands on a greasy cloth. \"But to a true dawi, all their work reeks of imperfection. And I can overlook minor flaws when inventing something new—but these are beginner's errors: failing to handle the forge properly, mistakes in basic fittings… things they ought to have learned before they let their beards grow. What happens to these 'half-dawi' born outside the mountains? They don't carry clan discipline in their blood.\"\n\"I'll try to get you real dawi. I thought they'd be useful when I recruited them in Altdorf. I didn't mean to cause you grievance,\" I replied, regarding the workers with more patience than conviction.\n\"Thank you… I know you don't want trouble. But make sure they can actually work properly,\" Grimm answered. \"And if you can, bring me a mobile forge. Speak to a runesmith and commission something light, that can hold a steady temperature. I'd also need a rune-etched cart to transport it. I don't want to start from scratch every time we halt. Right now, I produce one or two shotguns a day at best.\"\n\"I'll speak with my contacts in the mountains and get you what you ask for, Grimm. In the meantime, you'll have to make do with what we have. And I need you to invent something new for me—something that makes my forces far more effective against multiple enemies,\" I said, pointing at the parts and plans.\n\"What do you need, umgi? Better powder?\" the dwarf asked, leaning over a barrel as he hammered a piece into place.\n\"Not just that. I want a new weapon—something easier to load than a musket. Musketeer units are efficient, but they require training. If we combine the rapid-fire mechanism you use in shotguns with the power and range of a musket, we could create a weapon that lets a common man—with little training—bring down dozens in short order.\" My smile widened at Grimm's reaction.\n\"What do you have in mind?\" the dawi asked with genuine interest, picking up one of the pieces I had handed him days earlier.\n\"Do you remember the ammunition I gave you to convince you?\" I said, pulling out one of the special bronze cartridges I always carried. \"That innovation in loading capacity—the fulminate and its primer—is the key. I need you to build a musket with a mechanism similar to the shotgun: something that fires this ammunition reliably. It shouldn't be impossible for you to make a couple of prototypes for testing. I'll test their accuracy myself; we'll also fit a scope from Hochland long rifles to improve a marksman's aim.\"\nGrimm fell silent for a few seconds, thoughtful. \"If it can be done, I already have an idea for a system that might work… Give me a few days and I'll see what I can give you. In the meantime, bring me skilled hands of a true dawi. We're not far from Karaz-a-Karak: go ask for smiths. You could even request aid from an apprentice guild; they'll do a far better job than my current assistants.\"\nMeanwhile, I decided to reassign Grimm's dozen helpers. I put them to work on construction duties. Those dwarfs executed orders and raised structures with a precision and speed far beyond my own men—far better suited to building bridges or palisades than handling delicate mechanisms.\nWith orders sent for proper smiths, I began moving the troops for the next campaign. My plan was to establish a firm frontier: the Starnek River would serve as a dividing line against the other princes, and to secure it I had to take at least two key cities controlling its banks. One would be a challenge similar to Akendorf; the other, smaller, ought to fall within days if we executed the maneuver properly.\nFor now, everything depended on mobility: garrisoning strongpoints, consolidating supply lines, and leaving the new colonization zone in the hands of trusted captains until the dwarf smiths and engineers could finish their work.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

All I could manage was to blunt the edges of enemy weapons in the heat of the fight, to weaken their armor, even turn it temporarily into lead. Yet I could not reveal my gift publicly, not until my training with the Colleges of Magic was complete.\nTwo lances shattered against my runic armor as my griffon tore apart two knights already fallen beneath its claws; the beast's talons sliced through them as though they were butter, steel and all.\nDozens of my men, clad in their rune-forged armor, pierced their foes with ease. Steel without runes or enchantment is rarely a match for dwarfen craft: when the runes flared, enemy weapons struck only to rebound, useless.\nUnhorsing another rider with a swing of my mace, I saw long lines of my musketeers forming for a volley—they would soon unleash their fire into the mass still entangled with Styratia's riders.\nI spurred my griffon to leap, crushing two horses and their riders beneath us as we landed; my beast's talons sheared through everything in its path.\n\"Come on… retreat, retreat!\" I shouted, and my men quickly followed as we pulled back from the first clash. The enemy cavalry tried to form up and give chase.\nThen came the thunder of muskets behind us, the metallic crack of lead slamming into steel. Looking back, I saw dozens of enemy riders strewn across the ground, the survivors falling from their saddles as their mounts collapsed or stumbled over corpses.\nAnother thunderclap rolled across the field as the second line fired, then the third. Nearly all of the enemy cavalry we had just fought lay dead; the rest began to retreat toward their camp.\n\"Let's go, let's go! They struck by surprise, but we mustn't give them time for a counterattack. If we strike now, we'll catch them with their trousers down!\" I shouted as my griffon took flight, giving me a vantage point over the battlefield. Seeing with my arcane gift was one thing; seeing with my own eyes was another.\nThe enemy army was large for what one would expect of a cattle city. They fielded a great deal of cavalry and a strange system of war: hundreds of crossbowmen and archers sheltered within war wagons, forming a defensive line.\nAt once I noticed the tactics—Hussite-style war: many wagons, little infantry. After their failed ambush, they were preparing for that tedious, grinding defense.\nI landed my griffon and ordered: \"Halt! Halt! Do not advance further—they're waiting for us, and a cavalry charge would be wasted. Let the infantry advance and bring up some cannon. The only way to break their formation is with shot.\" My men stopped, waiting for the foot soldiers, while others rode back to Akendorf to see if artillery could be rushed to the field.\nAs we advanced toward the enemy forces, we saw reinforcements from their camp arriving. Their wagon-defense became an improvised fortress, reinforced by dozens of knights and riders who had escaped their failed ambush.\n\"Let them wait… if they stay here watching our moves, they'll be easy prey for our guns. Do we have word from the engineers yet?\" I asked the riders near me.\n\"Yes, my lord. They should arrive shortly,\" one replied.\n\"Good. Have the infantry spread out and place the pikemen at the front—ready for any cavalry charge. No one is to move without orders. We'll wait for the cannon and strike only once victory is certain.\" My men obeyed, forming their lines as more reinforcements marched in from the rear.\nBattle lines stretched across the field; soldiers took their places while reserves filled the gaps. Minutes dragged by until at last the cannon arrived—drawn by horses, engineers swiftly deploying them on the crest of a nearby hill. At the sight of the guns, the enemy began pulling back toward their camp.\n\"Damn it… we'll have no choice but to harry them all the way back to their city. They won't fight in the open unless the ground favors them,\" I muttered, drawing one of my pistols from its holster.\nI loaded the weapon and rose slightly on my griffon, my men following close behind, as we soared over the contested ground. I stretched my senses with magic, probing the field. At once I felt it—more cavalry hidden behind hills to our right, and other forces waiting to the left.\n\"It seems their commander is no fool… Fire a few shots, then fall back to the right. I see horses there—it must be their hidden force,\" I ordered as my griffon climbed higher.\nMy men pressed on, pursuing the retreating army. I flew above with the griffon, arrows raining up toward me—but with my magic I bent their flight, sending them back down upon their own archers, who fell screaming among their ranks. Then I dove, aiming for one of the wagons bristling with crossbowmen and bowmen.\nMy griffon landed with talons spread, wings beating furiously. Its claws tore through several men in the wagon; their attempts to reach the beast with lances, arrows, or bolts failed, as I diverted every projectile aimed at her. Together we ripped apart those mounted on that cart while the horses panicked at the griffon's presence.\nWhile chaos erupted in the area, my men arrived and opened fire as they split into two groups, shooting at anything within range. Several enemies tried to use their crossbows, but I had already ruined their mechanisms with Chamon, and those who still had functioning weapons found themselves unable to defend properly with a giant griffon at their side. When my men finally emptied their pistols, I rose into the air again, firing both of mine before returning to reload alongside them, performing the slow, tedious process of charging muzzle-loaders.\nWith pistols reloaded, we charged the cavalry forces hidden on the flanks. The moment they realized we were upon them, the other forces across the field began to flee, as did the horsemen—seeing that their ambush had failed.\nOur infantry advanced after the enemy troops, who fled en masse, abandoning their camp to be plundered. Meanwhile, my men and I pursued a sizeable group of knights in heavy armor fleeing at full speed toward the river. Time and again I swooped down with my griffon, crushing riders beneath us, their bodies trapped in Princess's talons, until we had cut many down. Even so, I forced myself to halt the pursuit; their commander showed too much tactical knowledge, and I would not have been surprised if he tried to spring some stratagem learned from the books of war to trap me.\nBack at the enemy camp, my men had already begun the looting and gathered a multitude of prisoners. Most of the forces hidden on the far side had surrendered. Just by the clothes they wore, I knew they were mercenaries.\n''Signore Generale… surrender yes. want no more blood, capisce? Fortune not with company. But… I and my ragazzi, skilled swordsmen, soldiers of fortune. If you, Generale, need men fight for gold, lend you my sword. Not free, …'' said one of the captains, mixing Reikspiel with Tilean\n\"No… I don't speak Tilean. Don't you have anyone with you who speaks Reikspiel or Bretonnian?\" I asked the mercenary captain.\nThe man looked at me, then argued with his subordinates and other captains who had also surrendered.\n\"Does anyone speak Bretonnian?\" I asked.Googlᴇ search NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"Yes. I do. I'll explain what our captain wants,\" said one of them, stepping forward.\n\"Work. We were hired to strike at your rear, but it never happened. He asks if you are interested in hiring mercenaries for your army,\" the man explained in Bretonnian.\n\"I'm not sure. Mercenaries are always quick to change sides,\" I replied, watching the group of captains.\nThe captain spoke again in Tilean to his men, gesturing broadly.\n\"We are men of honor, as you can see. We did not surrender until all was lost. The cavalry of the lord of Styratia was meant to deliver the killing blow, but once their hiding place was discovered, the battle was already lost. We would have fought until our contract was fulfilled, but now that is no longer possible… The gold owed us is there,\" said the mercenary in Bretonnian, pointing to a large tent my men had already secured.\n\"Well, what does it matter,\" I said in Reikspiel. \"Tell them to give me a written estimate of their yearly wages—every captain.\" I then made my way to the tent that radiated a faint sensation of Chamon.\nInside, my men received me while some dwarfs of my host patiently counted coins, recording the details of the captured treasure.\n\"How much gold and silver is here?\" I asked, glancing over the chests.\n\"Hard to tell, my lord. I fear the coins are of poor quality… tin coated in silver, or bronze gilded. They're worth little. We'd need to separate the metals to make them useful; I wouldn't recommend spending them as they are,\" one of the Imperial dawi answered.\n\"Damn it… and what about the coinage of Akendorf and Munzig? I've already paid for things with it,\" I said, startled that the treasure was almost worthless.\n\"Those were Imperial coins, my lord. Crowns from Reikland, Averland, Nuln, mostly. Those are safe to use,\" replied the dawi.\n\"Oh… a relief,\" I murmured, staring at the coffers.\nFor more than an hour I examined the spoils: weapons, armor, supplies. Most of it held little value for me, but it could equip local militias until shipments from my own factories arrived—factories which, for now, barely managed to replace battlefield losses.\nAfterward, I reviewed the mercenary captains' offers. Each demanded different sums, in silver or gold, according to the coinage of their princes—many of which I did not even recognize. I would have to speak with them again and make it clear that, if accepted, their pay would be in golden crowns.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Hiring mercenaries in this region turned out to be much cheaper than one would expect: they were used to being paid in debased coin, so payment in Imperial currency cost only a fraction of what a sellsword would demand in the Empire. Before long, I had gathered a respectable mercenary army under my command.\nThe only drawback was that I had to begin learning Tilean—at least the basics—since many mercenary companies spoke nothing else. There were Imperial and Bretonnian contingents in the region as well, but even so I managed to keep a thirty-thousand-strong mercenary host with relative ease. Paying them in crowns and in genuine gold and silver coins made their captains lower their demands, giving me plenty of leverage in negotiations.\nThat was how I drew more mercenaries to my side: it wasn't hard to convince them when seven major cities of the Princes had fallen in record time. That streak placed me in an extremely advantageous position.\nWith a mercenary army that quickly replenished itself with each new wave of recruits, I conquered the last five cities I needed to fulfill my territorial ambitions in the Principalities. We crushed the armies of Styratia; the city surrendered soon after, once its mercenaries fled and most of its troops lay dead. The lord opened the gates and yielded—his culture was more cohesive and he refused to see his people suffer through a drawn-out siege, something I appreciated.\nWith mercenary aid, we marched south and seized Broska, where a self-proclaimed Bretonnian duke ruled whom no one recognized. The city was small and its forces did not exceed a thousand, but resistance was immediate: with a Bretonnian leader at their head, they decided to fight until their walls fell under a brief pounding from my cannons. The duke then challenged me to single combat: whoever won would keep the city; if I lost, I had to withdraw. I struck him square in the chest with my mace, breaking his ribs and leaving him dead; thus they proclaimed me lord of the city, and I secured the river as my western frontier, for there were no major settlements beyond.\nI mobilized the people: they were all concentrated into Gloom Forest. Together, the cities amounted to nearly a quarter of a million souls, and now they had to labor and settle along the new frontier. With mercenaries scattered to guard rivers and cleanse the forests of goblins, the region was relatively secure.\nYet the wildlife stirred: the forest fire had driven many species into motion. Wolf packs were sighted in the area, and rains out of season swelled the rivers, flooding some minor villages—fortunately already abandoned. The rain halted us for a week; when it finally ceased, mud was everywhere, slowing our advance south.\nWe came across a clan dwelling in a network of caves; when the rains hit, they retreated deeper. We sealed the entrances with soaked logs and set a massive fire that filled the caverns with smoke. The beasts came out in waves, choking and desperate, and we slaughtered them in great numbers without much effort—they were cornered and wiped out with ruthless efficiency.\nFrom there we struck the city of Vitrolle, which fell in two days. A devastating cannon bombardment against one section of the walls, followed by a general assault by the mercenaries, ended resistance swiftly. The cruelty of the mercenary host did the rest: the sack lasted three days and left the city in ruins.\nMuch of Vitrolle was burned, the shops of the merchants looted, and numerous women violated. I had no interest in stopping the carnage; the violence served as an example. As word of the disaster spread, two nearby, larger cities—Zenres and Mirstadt—opened their gates and surrendered to avoid Vitrolle's fate.\nThe northern confederation collapsed rapidly. No one came to the aid of the cities before my army: until then, only envoys had arrived, hoping that as an Imperial emissary I would recognize them as rightful lords of their lands. They treated me as their ticket to political legitimacy rather than the threat I was to them.\nBut with the fall of those three cities, I had struck gold. Another quarter of a million peasants were seized and sent to the region I had designated for the building of new towns and farmlands.\nThis area carried an additional value: many Cathayan trade caravans passed through. Apparently, it was safer to cross vast stretches of land than to risk the seas, where piracy held sway enough to force such a vast empire to prefer land routes. And here, near Mad Dog Pass, was one of the most traveled paths for their merchants.\nEach month hundreds, perhaps thousands, of traders from the Eastern Empire crossed these roads, paying generous tolls to keep them free of greenskins. In recent years, however, that had become far harder: the fall of hundreds of Karaks and the decline of Dawi power made protection more difficult. That didn't stop the merchants from trying; they simply traveled with larger armed contingents and paid less for passage.\nEven so, the profits were immense. Zenres and Mirstadt held enormous reserves of Cathayan gold coins, such vast hoards that even I was astonished. Their lords were immensely wealthy, but instead of investing in walls and defenses they preferred to pay adventurers and mercenary bands. When I arrived, that choice backfired: the companies fled en masse and the cities surrendered.\n\"This business of being a conqueror is taking its toll on me… I do not feel sleep from the ring, but I feel defeated,\" I murmured, gazing at my conquests spread across the map.\n\"Those towns you conquered lack strength and unity, and for now everything is in your favor. The question is: how much further will you try to conquer before your ambition turns against you?\" said Katarin, watching me as I rested in the lord's chair of Zenres.\n\"I don't know… I only know that, for now, I've secured the Imperial zone. What's left is to start building a railway line between the Empire and Karaz-a-Karak. With this region secured, we could dedicate it exclusively to trade with the dawi—or better yet, place a station here in Zenres to funnel the merchants of Cathay toward the Empire. Those wretches carry deep purses; they'd pay a fortune for the chance,\" I replied.\nKatarin rubbed her forehead wearily and let out a heavy sigh. \"You like to make plans everywhere, but you rarely focus on maintaining them,\" she said.\n\"I just try to keep myself busy, that's the truth. Look: my gold is finite, and at this rate, I'll be out of money by next year. I have to seek new sources of income, and these tolls could be part of the solution. Just look at this: a single Cathayan caravan paid the equivalent of twelve thousand gold crowns… one caravan, and thousands come every year. Do you realize? It's a gold mine. All we need is to fortify the area, clear the greenskin tribes from the mountains, and wipe out the goblin forests—just as the mercenaries are doing—and we'll have a region that generates great sums to be used within the Empire,\" I said with a smile.\n\"You could do all of that in Kislev. There you'll find the same problems you've pointed out, only multiplied: mutants, Chaos cultists… you'll be more than busy,\" Katarin replied.\n\"I know, my dear betrothed… I think you've already told me a hundred times,\" I answered with a grin, meeting her gaze.\n\"I'm only fulfilling my duty by reminding you of your promises to Kislev,\" she said.\n\"I have it very clear, Katarin…\" I replied, pulling out a letter I had received not long ago, the one that would silence her daily claims about my duty to Kislev and her homeland. \"The railway to the Kislevite border is almost finished… and they've already started construction further into Kislev. So, once we secure this, we'll return to tend to Kislev and see to what you desire so much—along with delivering that shipment of weapons I promised you,\" I added, handing her the letter.\n\"Finally, good news… when do we leave for Kislev?\" asked Katarin, showing genuine happiness for a moment before resuming her icy-princess façade.\n\"We could already return… but I'd have to leave this place well administered and enough forces behind to defend it. Mercenaries aren't cheap, and you can't trust them with fortress garrisons; they'd be the first to sell them to my enemies. So probably next month, once everything is settled and I'm sure the area is secure,\" I replied.\n\"Let's hope it works out sooner than you imagine,\" said Katarin.\n\"Yes. Well, I'll leave you now: I have a meeting with Grimm and I want to be ready to see a new weapon,\" I said, rising and preparing to depart.\n\"A new weapon?… may I come?\" Katarin asked, intrigued.\n\"I suppose you might find what we're working on interesting. It's only a prototype, so it could fail; don't get your hopes too high,\" I answered.\nWe quickly gathered our things and traveled to the outskirts of Zenres, to one of the hills bordering a greenskin tribe. We had mobilized many men to secure the area, and soon we met with the dawi engineer.\n\"Here it is, umgi… just as you asked: a breech-loading musket firing the ammunition you gave me, with the magnifying sights you requested. I hope it's the weapon you imagined. I've already run safety tests, so it shouldn't blow your face off… I hope,\" said Grimm, handing me a double-barreled rifle. I pushed the breech forward, loaded two large cartridges, and knelt to aim.\nThrough the magnifying sights I could see my target much more clearly: a goblin moving some three or four hundred meters away, lifting stones, perhaps searching for food. I gripped the weapon tightly, ready for the powerful recoil I knew the cartridge would deliver.\nWhen the goblin stopped, I drew a deep breath, set my eye to the scope, and pulled one of the two triggers. I felt a kick in my shoulder; the recoil struck hard, but it wasn't unbearable. Through the sight I saw the goblin fall with a massive hole in its chest.\n\"It works… I think it's fine. The problem will be the stock: it has too much power. Unless the shooter is wearing runic armor or has a lot of experience with firearms, the weapon kicks far too hard. We might want to look into reducing the charge to make it easier to fire… though hundreds of these could still be produced for use against larger enemies,\" I said, aiming again as a group of greenskins approached, drawn by the noise.\nMy focus fixed on an orc much larger than the rest, charging with a great axe. I pulled the second trigger, and part of its skull vanished instantly.\n\"Yes… it works well against large targets, but it demands a lot of control,\" I added, sliding two more cartridges into the barrels. \"Shotguns forward,\" I ordered my men as I kept firing at the greenskins from the hill, while they waited in position with their shotguns.\n\"It could serve to bring down champions of the Dark Gods. They wear heavy armor when they attack Kislev, and only our finest warriors or the strongest ice witches can bring them down. This might be useful in Kislev,\" said Katarin.\n\"We'll keep that in mind… Well, Grimm: if you make a hundred of these, we'll store them. But I need something of smaller caliber and less recoil—something closer to a musket, maybe a little larger. This thing is for killing giants, almost,\" I answered.\n\"I'll see what I can do,\" replied Grimm, and we began to withdraw as the sounds of the shotguns continued tearing through the greenskins farther down the hill.\nMeanwhile, I turned to planning an administration system for this place, for several fortresses had to be garrisoned, and I had no desire to rely too much on the locals for recruitment.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------\nᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet",

If the Cathayan merchants bring in around two million crowns a year from the tolls, that should more than cover the expenses of the guards, the construction of fortresses, and even the pay for the mercenary army to keep fighting the greenskins,\" I said, consulting a ledger and estimating the toll income based on what the cities protecting the pass collected.\n\"Not that expensive? You've spent an enormous amount of gold on something that won't bring you immediate profit… you're spending on cities, building fortresses and railroads all over the region, as well as paying a massive mercenary army to fight and burn forests in your name… on a very active frontier,\" Katarin retorted, reading the ledger.\n\"Well then… shouldn't we not go to Kislev? That would be the same thing: spending huge amounts of gold and men to drive thousands of cultists and mutants from the region,\" I answered, giving her a taste of her usual sarcasm.\n\"good one… only I don't understand how you can spend so much on a campaign and be content with so few results. Father has many campaigns planned that would allow us to exploit countless resources if we achieved victories: rebuilding Kislev, selling in the markets, and obtaining more funds to finance the armies that fight for the motherland,\" said Katarin.\n\"That's how long-term income works. Unlike Kislev, here I'm not cornered, where every coin matters and every trained soldier can change the outcome of a battle. Here I must think ahead. We're not far from Karak Eight Peaks, a great dawi fortress lost to the greenskins and now being reclaimed. Can you imagine the gifts I could receive from the dawi if I helped recover it? This anti-magic ring would be a trifle compared to what High King Thorgrim keeps in his vaults: perhaps armor from the war of the Beard, or relics even older from the Dwarfs' Golden Age. That's what I'm aiming for: something with great runic power,\" I replied.\n\"Besides, this benefits the Empire: now we have greater control over the greenskin tribes and fewer invasions from the south. That is what matters. Later I can go to Altdorf and request recruitment permits. Though I think I've already recruited as much as possible—at least until the next generation—Averland and Nuln might authorize more and raise men. I'll train and equip them with the finest weaponry in the Empire, securing cheap raw materials thanks to my betrothed's father… with that I'll expand my influence within the Empire by selling affordable arms, and gunpowder at inflated prices. It's a long-term plan that will fill my coffers,\" I concluded.\n\"I understand that part of the plan… only your expenses seem far too high for something that might bear fruit years from now, perhaps in the next decade,\" said Katarin.\n\"That's how investments work: if you expect immediate returns, it's rarely the best course; you're sacrificing something. But this will be a safe investment with swift results: within a year and a half I'll have recouped everything invested in the campaign—from supplies to recruitment to the construction of cities and fortresses—so it's relatively quick. Of course, there's always the risk of disaster: a greenskin invasion or a wave of Chaos followers. The next year, or the year after, I'll continue the campaign to dominate the remaining princes; for now we must wait for this first round of investments to take effect and then keep reinvesting,\" I explained.\n\"And what will happen when you leave? I thought you wanted to name yourself Elector Count in this region… are you investing this wealth for the benefit of others?\" Katarin asked.\n\"At first I thought of becoming Elector Count by emptying the land of its people. But after seeing the reality—that the people here cannot be trusted—I changed my mind. I'm aiming for governance through governors, as the Emperor does: he has the power to dismiss them without needing proof of treason; it is enough to say their services are no longer required. I'll leave a group of vassals in charge in my absence, assisted by dawi administrators, and thus we'll have a stable government that extracts the maximum profit from the population,\" I replied.\n\"Let's hope nothing arises that forces you to divert your attention then… may Ursun protect these lands so your aid may serve the motherland and we may fight the corrupting forces that plague Kislev,\" said Katarin.\n\"Yes, Katarin. We leave today. I've already taken care of everything: we only need to return to Nuln, and we'll be in Kislev within days… the railway between Altdorf and Nuln is ready as well, so I can ensure it's used to move men and supplies to help Kislev as soon as possible,\" I answered, stretching.\n\"I'll make sure I'm ready for our departure,\" said Katarin, and at once she went to prepare her things—furniture and belongings of pure ice, as Kislevite sorceresses favored.\nIt didn't take long to set everything in order before departing. I made a quick recruitment among the locals of Akendorf; I had them swear the oath to Sigmar to secure their loyalty somewhat—though I disliked leaving locals armed to defend the lands, the other options didn't convince me either. Leaving thousands of my battle-hardened men as mere guards wasn't optimal: to train a veteran through dozens of battles only to have him watch roads seemed a waste. And I could not trust mercenaries: relying on the loyalty of one is like building on mud.\nStill, I kept mercenary forces stationed in areas with large greenskin settlements, paying them per head they brought me and encouraging them to launch periodic skirmishes. If they thought their contractor wasn't present, they would have incentive to fight instead of lazing about.\nI recruited ten thousand locals and handed them all the old weapons I could salvage from my victories in the region. I left some of our finest veterans as instructors: their task would be to protect the fortresses under construction and secure the roads used by Cathayan caravans. Many of the most trusted captains I appointed as administrators of the new territories; the local dawi were left as co-administrators—though many couldn't read or write, their role was partly ceremonial and partly a guarantee of order. The true administrators of trust were the dawi; they were not the same as their mountain cousins, but they shared a similar sense of duty, though less unyielding.\nI left fortresses guarding the key areas, fortified the rivers to the west and south, and negotiated with the dawi, who looked favorably upon the Imperial annexation of the region. With everything ready to depart, I wrapped up the last preparations and prepared to march.\nWhile my forces marched north, I took a short detour to Barak Varr, where I met with the Dwarf King of the city to update the agreement on the underground district of Marienburg. It seemed they had accepted our terms: we would not excessively interfere with their legal control of the district and would grant them broad autonomy—the dawi would largely self-govern—in exchange for paying the proper taxes. Their only demand was that Imperial courts not meddle in their internal disputes.\nWith no disagreements, and after talks with their representatives, I managed to purchase three ships from the dawi, who promised to send them to Marienburg once completed. They would be dwarf warships to guard our coasts; the crews would reside in Marienburg, but the vessels would be operated by the dawi themselves. It was a good bargain struck with those dwarf kings.\nWith that concluded, I rejoined the marching column. Within a few days we were back at Black Fire Pass, where we found the Cult of Sigmar's fortress still under construction, aided by the dawi of Karak-Norm. It was a fortification that had not ceased to grow: colossal walls nearly matching the height of the surrounding hills. Though much of it was still being built, there was no doubt that once completed it would be an almost impregnable bastion of the Empire.\nWe were warmly received by the Cult. I negotiated with the arch-lector in charge of the new fortress so that the Cult would finance churches in my new territories; they accepted immediately. They pledged to build ten churches and send a hundred warrior-priests and witch hunters to secure the region against corruption.\nOur march through Averland was swift and uneventful: the weather favored us, and the reports indicated my lands were stable—only a minor naval attack had been intercepted by the Imperial fleet. Everything seemed calm, and the harvest promised to be bountiful.\nInstead of wasting time and gold in Altdorf on wedding ceremonies and pomp, I boarded the train and we sped north to Kislev. If anyone asked, I would say it was on urgent business for the Cult; that would not be a lie.\nI do not believe the God of Humanity cares whether I go and slaughter thousands of mutants, or face Chaos champions in battle, while aiding a state that will serve as the first shield against the great invasion to come. That, for now, was far more important than any courtly pageantry.\nSo we gathered a vast amount of supplies in Nuln and Altdorf; once we connected to the railway, it took us barely a day to reach Kislev—literally a journey of hours instead of the weeks it would have taken by march. The railway carried us from Altdorf to Bechafen in a single day.\nOf course, not the entire army traveled at once: for now the line was triple—two tracks for smooth two-way travel, and a third dedicated solely to moving materials from Kislev back to Reinsfeld or Marienburg as needed. Progress had been rapid: the line already reached Kislev, and my workers were busy extending it toward Praag to make the journeys even more productive.\n\"How is it possible that it's summer and still this cold here?\" I said as I stepped off the train, followed by Katarin, who smiled as she gazed upon the lands of her nation.\n\"Kislev is no land for the weak… summers are not warm, but they are bearable; winters are harsh, like the people of Kislev. Let us not waste time: let's go to the palace to see if my father is here,\" Katarin replied.\n\"You go. I need to organize the materiel we brought. We have a mountain of weapons to prepare for your father,\" I told her as I walked over to my men unloading crates full of muskets recently manufactured for Kislev.\nThere was a bustle at the station: a crowd gathered around us, watching with curiosity as we unloaded supplies and weaponry. Soon city guards arrived in fine armor—clearly in the service of the Tsar—and before long Katarin appeared again, now accompanied by her father. He arrived astride his enormous war bear, while she rode close by on a proud white horse.\nClearly understanding the purpose of their arrival, I ordered more of my men to unload the crates containing the muskets.The source of thɪs content is NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nOnce they were stacked, row upon row of boxes revealed the rifles neatly arranged inside.\nThe Tsar Boris immediately dismounted from his bear and began inspecting the weapons.\n\"How many have you brought?\" was his first question to me.\n\"Straight to the point, eh… Twenty thousand of these. Could have been more, but I still have to supply the Imperial army, replacing losses from training. The rest of the crates are ammunition and powder we brought along,\" I replied, while my men continued to unload crate after crate.\n\"How many men will come to our aid?\" asked the Tsar, thoughtful but with a smile that kept spreading across his face.\n\"Forty thousand. They'll arrive and spend a few days in Kislev to acclimatize and get used to their new winter gear… I can already see it will be a hard campaign,\" I answered.\n\"Excellent… Let us discuss the price of everything at the palace,\" said the Tsar, leading me toward the city.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Hiring mercenaries in this region turned out to be much cheaper than one would expect: they were used to being paid in debased coin, so payment in Imperial currency cost only a fraction of what a sellsword would demand in the Empire. Before long, I had gathered a respectable mercenary army under my command.\nThe only drawback was that I had to begin learning Tilean—at least the basics—since many mercenary companies spoke nothing else. There were Imperial and Bretonnian contingents in the region as well, but even so I managed to keep a thirty-thousand-strong mercenary host with relative ease. Paying them in crowns and in genuine gold and silver coins made their captains lower their demands, giving me plenty of leverage in negotiations.\nThat was how I drew more mercenaries to my side: it wasn't hard to convince them when seven major cities of the Princes had fallen in record time. That streak placed me in an extremely advantageous position.\nWith a mercenary army that quickly replenished itself with each new wave of recruits, I conquered the last five cities I needed to fulfill my territorial ambitions in the Principalities. We crushed the armies of Styratia; the city surrendered soon after, once its mercenaries fled and most of its troops lay dead. The lord opened the gates and yielded—his culture was more cohesive and he refused to see his people suffer through a drawn-out siege, something I appreciated.\nWith mercenary aid, we marched south and seized Broska, where a self-proclaimed Bretonnian duke ruled whom no one recognized. The city was small and its forces did not exceed a thousand, but resistance was immediate: with a Bretonnian leader at their head, they decided to fight until their walls fell under a brief pounding from my cannons. The duke then challenged me to single combat: whoever won would keep the city; if I lost, I had to withdraw. I struck him square in the chest with my mace, breaking his ribs and leaving him dead; thus they proclaimed me lord of the city, and I secured the river as my western frontier, for there were no major settlements beyond.\nI mobilized the people: they were all concentrated into Gloom Forest. Together, the cities amounted to nearly a quarter of a million souls, and now they had to labor and settle along the new frontier. With mercenaries scattered to guard rivers and cleanse the forests of goblins, the region was relatively secure.\nYet the wildlife stirred: the forest fire had driven many species into motion. Wolf packs were sighted in the area, and rains out of season swelled the rivers, flooding some minor villages—fortunately already abandoned. The rain halted us for a week; when it finally ceased, mud was everywhere, slowing our advance south.\nWe came across a clan dwelling in a network of caves; when the rains hit, they retreated deeper. We sealed the entrances with soaked logs and set a massive fire that filled the caverns with smoke. The beasts came out in waves, choking and desperate, and we slaughtered them in great numbers without much effort—they were cornered and wiped out with ruthless efficiency.\nFrom there we struck the city of Vitrolle, which fell in two days. A devastating cannon bombardment against one section of the walls, followed by a general assault by the mercenaries, ended resistance swiftly. The cruelty of the mercenary host did the rest: the sack lasted three days and left the city in ruins.\nMuch of Vitrolle was burned, the shops of the merchants looted, and numerous women violated. I had no interest in stopping the carnage; the violence served as an example. As word of the disaster spread, two nearby, larger cities—Zenres and Mirstadt—opened their gates and surrendered to avoid Vitrolle's fate.\nThe northern confederation collapsed rapidly. No one came to the aid of the cities before my army: until then, only envoys had arrived, hoping that as an Imperial emissary I would recognize them as rightful lords of their lands. They treated me as their ticket to political legitimacy rather than the threat I was to them.\nBut with the fall of those three cities, I had struck gold. Another quarter of a million peasants were seized and sent to the region I had designated for the building of new towns and farmlands.\nThis area carried an additional value: many Cathayan trade caravans passed through. Apparently, it was safer to cross vast stretches of land than to risk the seas, where piracy held sway enough to force such a vast empire to prefer land routes. And here, near Mad Dog Pass, was one of the most traveled paths for their merchants.\nEach month hundreds, perhaps thousands, of traders from the Eastern Empire crossed these roads, paying generous tolls to keep them free of greenskins. In recent years, however, that had become far harder: the fall of hundreds of Karaks and the decline of Dawi power made protection more difficult. That didn't stop the merchants from trying; they simply traveled with larger armed contingents and paid less for passage.\nEven so, the profits were immense. Zenres and Mirstadt held enormous reserves of Cathayan gold coins, such vast hoards that even I was astonished. Their lords were immensely wealthy, but instead of investing in walls and defenses they preferred to pay adventurers and mercenary bands. When I arrived, that choice backfired: the companies fled en masse and the cities surrendered.\n\"This business of being a conqueror is taking its toll on me… I do not feel sleep from the ring, but I feel defeated,\" I murmured, gazing at my conquests spread across the map.\n\"Those towns you conquered lack strength and unity, and for now everything is in your favor. The question is: how much further will you try to conquer before your ambition turns against you?\" said Katarin, watching me as I rested in the lord's chair of Zenres.\n\"I don't know… I only know that, for now, I've secured the Imperial zone. What's left is to start building a railway line between the Empire and Karaz-a-Karak. With this region secured, we could dedicate it exclusively to trade with the dawi—or better yet, place a station here in Zenres to funnel the merchants of Cathay toward the Empire. Those wretches carry deep purses; they'd pay a fortune for the chance,\" I replied.\nKatarin rubbed her forehead wearily and let out a heavy sigh. \"You like to make plans everywhere, but you rarely focus on maintaining them,\" she said.\n\"I just try to keep myself busy, that's the truth. Look: my gold is finite, and at this rate, I'll be out of money by next year. I have to seek new sources of income, and these tolls could be part of the solution. Just look at this: a single Cathayan caravan paid the equivalent of twelve thousand gold crowns… one caravan, and thousands come every year. Do you realize? It's a gold mine. All we need is to fortify the area, clear the greenskin tribes from the mountains, and wipe out the goblin forests—just as the mercenaries are doing—and we'll have a region that generates great sums to be used within the Empire,\" I said with a smile.\n\"You could do all of that in Kislev. There you'll find the same problems you've pointed out, only multiplied: mutants, Chaos cultists… you'll be more than busy,\" Katarin replied.\n\"I know, my dear betrothed… I think you've already told me a hundred times,\" I answered with a grin, meeting her gaze.\n\"I'm only fulfilling my duty by reminding you of your promises to Kislev,\" she said.\n\"I have it very clear, Katarin…\" I replied, pulling out a letter I had received not long ago, the one that would silence her daily claims about my duty to Kislev and her homeland. \"The railway to the Kislevite border is almost finished… and they've already started construction further into Kislev. So, once we secure this, we'll return to tend to Kislev and see to what you desire so much—along with delivering that shipment of weapons I promised you,\" I added, handing her the letter.\n\"Finally, good news… when do we leave for Kislev?\" asked Katarin, showing genuine happiness for a moment before resuming her icy-princess façade.\n\"We could already return… but I'd have to leave this place well administered and enough forces behind to defend it. Mercenaries aren't cheap, and you can't trust them with fortress garrisons; they'd be the first to sell them to my enemies. So probably next month, once everything is settled and I'm sure the area is secure,\" I replied.\n\"Let's hope it works out sooner than you imagine,\" said Katarin.\n\"Yes. Well, I'll leave you now: I have a meeting with Grimm and I want to be ready to see a new weapon,\" I said, rising and preparing to depart.\n\"A new weapon?… may I come?\" Katarin asked, intrigued.\n\"I suppose you might find what we're working on interesting. It's only a prototype, so it could fail; don't get your hopes too high,\" I answered.\nWe quickly gathered our things and traveled to the outskirts of Zenres, to one of the hills bordering a greenskin tribe. We had mobilized many men to secure the area, and soon we met with the dawi engineer.\n\"Here it is, umgi… just as you asked: a breech-loading musket firing the ammunition you gave me, with the magnifying sights you requested. I hope it's the weapon you imagined. I've already run safety tests, so it shouldn't blow your face off… I hope,\" said Grimm, handing me a double-barreled rifle. I pushed the breech forward, loaded two large cartridges, and knelt to aim.\nThrough the magnifying sights I could see my target much more clearly: a goblin moving some three or four hundred meters away, lifting stones, perhaps searching for food. I gripped the weapon tightly, ready for the powerful recoil I knew the cartridge would deliver.\nWhen the goblin stopped, I drew a deep breath, set my eye to the scope, and pulled one of the two triggers. I felt a kick in my shoulder; the recoil struck hard, but it wasn't unbearable. Through the sight I saw the goblin fall with a massive hole in its chest.\n\"It works… I think it's fine. The problem will be the stock: it has too much power. Unless the shooter is wearing runic armor or has a lot of experience with firearms, the weapon kicks far too hard. We might want to look into reducing the charge to make it easier to fire… though hundreds of these could still be produced for use against larger enemies,\" I said, aiming again as a group of greenskins approached, drawn by the noise.\nMy focus fixed on an orc much larger than the rest, charging with a great axe. I pulled the second trigger, and part of its skull vanished instantly.\n\"Yes… it works well against large targets, but it demands a lot of control,\" I added, sliding two more cartridges into the barrels. \"Shotguns forward,\" I ordered my men as I kept firing at the greenskins from the hill, while they waited in position with their shotguns.\n\"It could serve to bring down champions of the Dark Gods. They wear heavy armor when they attack Kislev, and only our finest warriors or the strongest ice witches can bring them down. This might be useful in Kislev,\" said Katarin.\n\"We'll keep that in mind… Well, Grimm: if you make a hundred of these, we'll store them. But I need something of smaller caliber and less recoil—something closer to a musket, maybe a little larger. This thing is for killing giants, almost,\" I answered.\n\"I'll see what I can do,\" replied Grimm, and we began to withdraw as the sounds of the shotguns continued tearing through the greenskins farther down the hill.\nMeanwhile, I turned to planning an administration system for this place, for several fortresses had to be garrisoned, and I had no desire to rely too much on the locals for recruitment.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

If the Cathayan merchants bring in around two million crowns a year from the tolls, that should more than cover the expenses of the guards, the construction of fortresses, and even the pay for the mercenary army to keep fighting the greenskins,\" I said, consulting a ledger and estimating the toll income based on what the cities protecting the pass collected.\n\"Not that expensive? You've spent an enormous amount of gold on something that won't bring you immediate profit… you're spending on cities, building fortresses and railroads all over the region, as well as paying a massive mercenary army to fight and burn forests in your name… on a very active frontier,\" Katarin retorted, reading the ledger.\n\"Well then… shouldn't we not go to Kislev? That would be the same thing: spending huge amounts of gold and men to drive thousands of cultists and mutants from the region,\" I answered, giving her a taste of her usual sarcasm.\n\"good one… only I don't understand how you can spend so much on a campaign and be content with so few results. Father has many campaigns planned that would allow us to exploit countless resources if we achieved victories: rebuilding Kislev, selling in the markets, and obtaining more funds to finance the armies that fight for the motherland,\" said Katarin.\n\"That's how long-term income works. Unlike Kislev, here I'm not cornered, where every coin matters and every trained soldier can change the outcome of a battle. Here I must think ahead. We're not far from Karak Eight Peaks, a great dawi fortress lost to the greenskins and now being reclaimed. Can you imagine the gifts I could receive from the dawi if I helped recover it? This anti-magic ring would be a trifle compared to what High King Thorgrim keeps in his vaults: perhaps armor from the war of the Beard, or relics even older from the Dwarfs' Golden Age. That's what I'm aiming for: something with great runic power,\" I replied.\n\"Besides, this benefits the Empire: now we have greater control over the greenskin tribes and fewer invasions from the south. That is what matters. Later I can go to Altdorf and request recruitment permits. Though I think I've already recruited as much as possible—at least until the next generation—Averland and Nuln might authorize more and raise men. I'll train and equip them with the finest weaponry in the Empire, securing cheap raw materials thanks to my betrothed's father… with that I'll expand my influence within the Empire by selling affordable arms, and gunpowder at inflated prices. It's a long-term plan that will fill my coffers,\" I concluded.\n\"I understand that part of the plan… only your expenses seem far too high for something that might bear fruit years from now, perhaps in the next decade,\" said Katarin.\n\"That's how investments work: if you expect immediate returns, it's rarely the best course; you're sacrificing something. But this will be a safe investment with swift results: within a year and a half I'll have recouped everything invested in the campaign—from supplies to recruitment to the construction of cities and fortresses—so it's relatively quick. Of course, there's always the risk of disaster: a greenskin invasion or a wave of Chaos followers. The next year, or the year after, I'll continue the campaign to dominate the remaining princes; for now we must wait for this first round of investments to take effect and then keep reinvesting,\" I explained.\n\"And what will happen when you leave? I thought you wanted to name yourself Elector Count in this region… are you investing this wealth for the benefit of others?\" Katarin asked.\n\"At first I thought of becoming Elector Count by emptying the land of its people. But after seeing the reality—that the people here cannot be trusted—I changed my mind. I'm aiming for governance through governors, as the Emperor does: he has the power to dismiss them without needing proof of treason; it is enough to say their services are no longer required. I'll leave a group of vassals in charge in my absence, assisted by dawi administrators, and thus we'll have a stable government that extracts the maximum profit from the population,\" I replied.\n\"Let's hope nothing arises that forces you to divert your attention then… may Ursun protect these lands so your aid may serve the motherland and we may fight the corrupting forces that plague Kislev,\" said Katarin.\n\"Yes, Katarin. We leave today. I've already taken care of everything: we only need to return to Nuln, and we'll be in Kislev within days… the railway between Altdorf and Nuln is ready as well, so I can ensure it's used to move men and supplies to help Kislev as soon as possible,\" I answered, stretching.\n\"I'll make sure I'm ready for our departure,\" said Katarin, and at once she went to prepare her things—furniture and belongings of pure ice, as Kislevite sorceresses favored.\nIt didn't take long to set everything in order before departing. I made a quick recruitment among the locals of Akendorf; I had them swear the oath to Sigmar to secure their loyalty somewhat—though I disliked leaving locals armed to defend the lands, the other options didn't convince me either. Leaving thousands of my battle-hardened men as mere guards wasn't optimal: to train a veteran through dozens of battles only to have him watch roads seemed a waste. And I could not trust mercenaries: relying on the loyalty of one is like building on mud.\nStill, I kept mercenary forces stationed in areas with large greenskin settlements, paying them per head they brought me and encouraging them to launch periodic skirmishes. If they thought their contractor wasn't present, they would have incentive to fight instead of lazing about.\nI recruited ten thousand locals and handed them all the old weapons I could salvage from my victories in the region. I left some of our finest veterans as instructors: their task would be to protect the fortresses under construction and secure the roads used by Cathayan caravans. Many of the most trusted captains I appointed as administrators of the new territories; the local dawi were left as co-administrators—though many couldn't read or write, their role was partly ceremonial and partly a guarantee of order. The true administrators of trust were the dawi; they were not the same as their mountain cousins, but they shared a similar sense of duty, though less unyielding.\nI left fortresses guarding the key areas, fortified the rivers to the west and south, and negotiated with the dawi, who looked favorably upon the Imperial annexation of the region. With everything ready to depart, I wrapped up the last preparations and prepared to march.\nWhile my forces marched north, I took a short detour to Barak Varr, where I met with the Dwarf King of the city to update the agreement on the underground district of Marienburg. It seemed they had accepted our terms: we would not excessively interfere with their legal control of the district and would grant them broad autonomy—the dawi would largely self-govern—in exchange for paying the proper taxes. Their only demand was that Imperial courts not meddle in their internal disputes.\nWith no disagreements, and after talks with their representatives, I managed to purchase three ships from the dawi, who promised to send them to Marienburg once completed. They would be dwarf warships to guard our coasts; the crews would reside in Marienburg, but the vessels would be operated by the dawi themselves. It was a good bargain struck with those dwarf kings.\nWith that concluded, I rejoined the marching column. Within a few days we were back at Black Fire Pass, where we found the Cult of Sigmar's fortress still under construction, aided by the dawi of Karak-Norm. It was a fortification that had not ceased to grow: colossal walls nearly matching the height of the surrounding hills. Though much of it was still being built, there was no doubt that once completed it would be an almost impregnable bastion of the Empire.\nWe were warmly received by the Cult. I negotiated with the arch-lector in charge of the new fortress so that the Cult would finance churches in my new territories; they accepted immediately. They pledged to build ten churches and send a hundred warrior-priests and witch hunters to secure the region against corruption.\nOur march through Averland was swift and uneventful: the weather favored us, and the reports indicated my lands were stable—only a minor naval attack had been intercepted by the Imperial fleet. Everything seemed calm, and the harvest promised to be bountiful.\nInstead of wasting time and gold in Altdorf on wedding ceremonies and pomp, I boarded the train and we sped north to Kislev. If anyone asked, I would say it was on urgent business for the Cult; that would not be a lie.\nI do not believe the God of Humanity cares whether I go and slaughter thousands of mutants, or face Chaos champions in battle, while aiding a state that will serve as the first shield against the great invasion to come. That, for now, was far more important than any courtly pageantry.\nSo we gathered a vast amount of supplies in Nuln and Altdorf; once we connected to the railway, it took us barely a day to reach Kislev—literally a journey of hours instead of the weeks it would have taken by march. The railway carried us from Altdorf to Bechafen in a single day.\nOf course, not the entire army traveled at once: for now the line was triple—two tracks for smooth two-way travel, and a third dedicated solely to moving materials from Kislev back to Reinsfeld or Marienburg as needed. Progress had been rapid: the line already reached Kislev, and my workers were busy extending it toward Praag to make the journeys even more productive.\n\"How is it possible that it's summer and still this cold here?\" I said as I stepped off the train, followed by Katarin, who smiled as she gazed upon the lands of her nation.\n\"Kislev is no land for the weak… summers are not warm, but they are bearable; winters are harsh, like the people of Kislev. Let us not waste time: let's go to the palace to see if my father is here,\" Katarin replied.\n\"You go. I need to organize the materiel we brought. We have a mountain of weapons to prepare for your father,\" I told her as I walked over to my men unloading crates full of muskets recently manufactured for Kislev.\nThere was a bustle at the station: a crowd gathered around us, watching with curiosity as we unloaded supplies and weaponry. Soon city guards arrived in fine armor—clearly in the service of the Tsar—and before long Katarin appeared again, now accompanied by her father. He arrived astride his enormous war bear, while she rode close by on a proud white horse.\nClearly understanding the purpose of their arrival, I ordered more of my men to unload the crates containing the muskets.\nOnce they were stacked, row upon row of boxes revealed the rifles neatly arranged inside.\nThe Tsar Boris immediately dismounted from his bear and began inspecting the weapons.\n\"How many have you brought?\" was his first question to me.\n\"Straight to the point, eh… Twenty thousand of these. Could have been more, but I still have to supply the Imperial army, replacing losses from training. The rest of the crates are ammunition and powder we brought along,\" I replied, while my men continued to unload crate after crate.\n\"How many men will come to our aid?\" asked the Tsar, thoughtful but with a smile that kept spreading across his face.\n\"Forty thousand. They'll arrive and spend a few days in Kislev to acclimatize and get used to their new winter gear… I can already see it will be a hard campaign,\" I answered.\n\"Excellent… Let us discuss the price of everything at the palace,\" said the Tsar, leading me toward the city.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Merchants from across the world thronged every street. Workshops and artisans labored without pause, forging weapons and gear for the Tsar's endless wars to reclaim Kislev from Chaos and the plagues that scourge these lands.\nThe trade was startling for a land considered so backward. Truth was, you could sell a Kislevite a third-rate sword as though it were the finest blade in the world. Desperation has no price.\nIn the city's heart, the divide between the Gospodar and the Ungols was plain. The former enjoyed greater prosperity; the latter lived rougher lives, clad in furs and heavy hides. Now and again, one of them tried to look the part of the other.\nAs we moved, every gaze turned to my retinue. The faint gleam of my runic armor drew eyes; most of these people had never seen dawi craft before. To them it must have seemed near sorcery.\nWe reached the palace—or what remained of it. Much was still in ruin, scaffolds and stone blocks showing the work had only just begun.\n\"Here stood the Gospodarin Palace, seat of Tsars past,\" Boris said, gesturing at the half-built walls. \"Chaos cast it down in the Great War. Now we raise it anew.\"\n\"The Great War was two centuries ago,\" I said, lifting a brow. \"You're only rebuilding it now?\"\n\"There was no gold, nor men enough, son-in-law,\" the Tsar replied. \"My father spent his life taking back Kislev's lands, not raising monuments. He fought beasts and horrors, not broken walls. But before he died, he left us wealth and ground secure. I will use that legacy as it must be used. Boyars heed no Tsar without a palace. If I would have their respect, I must have these walls.\"\n\"I see. Let's just hope those boyars don't turn troublesome this year, or we'll be back where we started,\" I answered as the gates opened.\nWe entered the great hall, one of the few chambers already finished. Boyars and Ice Witches stood silent, eyes fixed on us.\n\"First, we speak in private,\" Boris said, pushing past his guards as he strode to a rear chamber. \"No proclamations until deals are sealed.\"\nI nodded, muttering under my breath, \"And that's why I hate these halls.\"\nInside, Boris sat heavily in a high-backed chair. Katarin took another beside him.\n\"Sit,\" the Tsar said. \"Tell me—how fared your campaign?\"\n\"Good enough. The Reikwald is cleared of beastmen. Villages and roads are safe, except for bandits—Reiksguard work, not mine. We smashed greenskin hordes and took cities in the Border Princes, securing some trade routes.\"\n\"That is well,\" Boris replied. \"Then you are free to aid Kislev without excuse.\"\n\"Yes. I can stay a couple of months before I have to return to Altdorf. I've matters with the Grand Theogonist and the Supreme Patriarch—licenses of magic use for your daughter, and for myself.\"\n\"For yourself?\" the Tsar said, his voice sharpening.\n\"He is a wizard,\" Katarin said, her tone steady, cold. \"And strong.\"\nBoris's eyes widened as he fixed his stare on me.\n\"A wizard… that will bring trouble. Men here do not practice magic. The Ice Witches forbid it. They will treat you as enemy,\" he said.\n\"They can call it what they like,\" I replied. \"If they want conflict, the Cult of Sigmar will answer, and nobody here wants that. My wind is Chamon, the lore of metal—not ice. They've nothing to fear from me.\" I bent a fragment of iron from the chair in my hand.\n\"Chamon,\" Boris said. \"I have heard of such—those who rot armor, turn steel to lead?\"\n\"Something like that,\" I said.\n\"Then as long as you are useful, it is enough. What matters is this: Chaos was beaten, but their holds remain. I would have struck them this year, but I burned out the goblin tribes in the Forest of Shadows first. Finished what my father left undone.\"\n\"And did you burn the woods after?\" I asked. \"If not, spores will return. Reduce it all to ash, or you'll face it again in a few years.\"\nBoris frowned, then looked to his daughter.\n\"Albrecht burns what greenskins touch,\" Katarin said coolly. \"He must have his reasons.\"\n\"It is dawi knowledge,\" I explained. \"Orcs are born of the earth. To end them, you scour the ground until it's barren. They're weeds—while their seeds remain, they sprout again. Burn the forest, or they will rise anew.\"\nThe Tsar leaned back, thoughtful. \"We had thought to use that timber, to raise new towns for the displaced. Always we promised to reclaim our lands, yet little came of it… If you say it, I will send men to burn the woods.\"\n\"Best course,\" I said. \"Greenskin wood is weak. Burn it. Cut a firebreak, scour the ground. If they see fungus, it marks infestation. Tear it out, fell it, burn it all. That is how you cleanse the taint.\"\n\"Very well… I shall do that. I will send men to burn the forest, and afterwards we shall see how much can be salvaged for building,\" the Tsar agreed. Then he added, \"I have gathered twenty-three thousand warriors for my campaigns. Winter makes it easier to recruit, when folk are less busy. For now, that is the strength I can field.\"\n\"As I said, I need a few weeks for my men to adjust to the climate. After that, we march north to retake the fortresses you named. With the railways ready, we can move supplies between my lands and Kislev—powder and shot will not be lacking,\" I replied.\nBoris studied me with interest. \"Yes… about that. At what price will you sell me the twenty thousand muskets you brought?\"\n\"Fifty gold crowns each. The same price I charge the Imperial army,\" I answered.\n\"That… is one million crowns. Far too much, truth be told,\" the Tsar muttered, scratching at his beard.\nKatarin's cold eyes fixed on me. \"We need the aid. Kislev cannot spend near half its yearly revenues on this shipment. We did not charge you for the land taken by your rail, and we will sell you timber and ore at fair rates. I think you can do the same for us,\" she said calmly.\n\"I certainly enjoy a generous margin selling to the Empire… very generous,\" I warned.\n\"Could you let them go at cost, and give us a discount on powder?\" Katarin suggested.\n\"Cost is too much to ask. Dropping to twelve crowns per musket cuts my profit to the bone,\" I replied.\n\"Twelve…\" Boris murmured, thoughtful. \"And you sell them at fifty. A fine bargain, no doubt… but we need the weapons, and funds are tight. So much must go to fortresses, to levies, to wages. We need that discount.\"\n\"I recall someone telling me such expenses were wasteful,\" I said, glancing at Katarin. \"But fine—consider the muskets a gift, for now, Tsar. A gesture, as we are kin, and because I am committed to the defense of the Motherland. Her safety serves the Empire as well.\"\nBoth Boris and his daughter exchanged a look, their sternness easing.\n\"Thank you, Albrecht… it will aid us greatly against the Ruinous Powers. We sorely needed arms; our smiths cannot keep pace with demand, and pulling them from armor-work left us short-handed,\" Boris said.\n\"Indeed… and those weapons would have sold well anywhere. I only hope not to see them in the hands of a boyar raiding Imperial soil, as happened before. Now then, tell me where we strike. I need to know what we prepare for,\" I asked, expecting the maps to be brought forth.\n\"I had thought to reclaim Fort Ostrosk. Once it was part of Kislev's defense lines. Now it is in the hands of Chaos' servants. They raid constantly, striking the lands around Praag. Many of the displaced come from that region, for their attacks make life impossible there,\" Boris said.\n\"I see,\" I replied, recognizing at once they must be Khorne cultists—brutes who fought only for blood.\n\"With luck, we might also retake Fort Zenilev, Fort Kaminski, and Fort Straghov. That would seal one of the routes used by raiders to steal captives and scour our lands,\" the Tsar continued.\n\"Then the situation is worse than I thought. Four forts lost. That is a great deal of fighting ahead. Fortunately, I have many cannons for that problem,\" I said, nodding.\n\"If it can be avoided, spare the cannon. We need the forts intact, else we only win rubble. Volksgrad still stands, but it is often under raid by slavers, and to the west it fares no better—the whole region lies lost. So first the northern forts, then westward. If we are swift, all may be secured before winter's onset,\" Boris said firmly.\n\"Yes. I can work with that. I only hope to be supplied with raw materials in great quantity and at low cost. My men will train in this climate, and in two weeks we march north,\" I answered.\n\"Excellent. I will see it done, and ready all for the march. I will bring as much powder as I can… Tell me, do you think the Kislevites themselves would answer to recruitment?\" I asked.\n\"There are recruits aplenty. What we lack are arms and armor for them, and coin for their wages. My budget is already stretched to the utmost. But there are thousands of young Gospodar eager to fight for Kislev,\" Boris replied.Discover more novels at N()velFire.net\n\"No greater honor exists for a son of Kislev than to fight for the Motherland,\" Katarin said with quiet pride.\n\"I see it the same,\" I agreed. \"Then we have an accord.\"\nI rose from my chair. The Tsar returned swiftly to his great hall, where yet more nobles watched. Even members of the Orthodoxy had come, their suspicion plain, adding to the ranks of boyars who stared with venom in their eyes.\nBoris seated himself on his throne, his daughter at his side, and proclaimed that forty thousand men of the Empire had come to aid in reclaiming Kislev's lost lands, along with many weapons to strengthen its defense.\nThe words stirred some cheer among the elder boyars, though the younger held themselves cautious and silent.\n\"Politics never change,\" I muttered, \"only the tongue they're spoken in.\"\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

As the heavy snows had not yet begun to fall, most of the Ungols were still away hunting, tending their herds, or working the fields that would soon be buried under meters of ice and rendered impossible to till. For that reason, the quarter stood nearly deserted—half-abandoned houses and shuttered stables, a perfect place to house our troops.\nFor two weeks there was no rest. Daily drills were organized: long runs across the plains, marches under full kit, formation exercises, and hand-to-hand bouts against the Tsar's own guard. Most of my men were Reiklanders, hardened by campaigns but unaccustomed to the perpetual cold of these lands. To march straight north into the heavy snows, against Chaos cultists blessed by Khorne, would have been madness. Better to harden our troops first, to let them grow used to the ice and the wind.\nDuring that time, I lived among the Kislevites—especially the Gospodars, proud nobles who avoided all contact with us. Many watched us with suspicion. The soldiers I had left behind months ago to train the Tsar's army had improved discipline and organization, but those gains came at a price. Dozens of boyars had lost command of troops they held only by birthright, without any skill in tactics. They saw it as an affront to their station, and all the blame fell upon my men, favored by the Tsar in matters of war, and therefore upon me.Read full story at nοvelfire.net\nRelations with the nobility soured. Dozens of boyars lost their posts; others, perhaps more deserving, gained commands they could never have achieved on their own thanks to the reforms. Still, resentment lingered. They did not want us here. Matters worsened when my betrothal to Katarin became public. Until then, Kislev had tried to keep it quiet to avoid stirring rebellion among the boyars, who dreamed of wedding their sons to the heir. The news struck like a thunderclap: a foreign noble, a Sigmarite no less, securing Kislev's future throne. For them it was a cultural, religious, and political blow.\nThe consequences came swiftly. Brawls in taverns, insults in the streets, even attacks on my men during night patrols. The tension was plain to see.\n\"Then we are ready?\" I asked one of the Dawi clerks responsible for my ledgers.\n\"Yes, my lord… all is ready. The powder shipments are secured; the weapons and ammunition for the Kislevites have been delivered. They have been seen practicing with the guns, though in small numbers, as if they were trying to save powder and shot,\" the Imperial dwarf replied, adjusting his spectacles as he scanned a parchment roll.\n\"They are likely short on funds if they ration powder, though I am already selling it to them near cost,\" I remarked, running my hand along my griffon's plumage as it snorted impatiently in the cold wind.\n\"Perhaps so. Recently the Tsar has raised another eight thousand men from the Ungol tribes. Their gear leaves much to be desired—heavy furs, bows, and spears. But they have horses in abundance, and that could prove decisive in the coming battle,\" said the Dawi.\n\"The horses will be useful. Kislev has gathered thirty thousand men for the campaign; with my forty thousand, we field a formidable host for the march north. Nothing should stop us, save ill fortune or a cunning stroke from our enemy,\" I replied, leaning over the map where the Tsar's suggested camp sites were marked.\n\"The provisions are ready as well. We have legumes from the latest harvests, and the greenhouses have been emptied; we hold enough supplies for two months of campaign. If the next harvest comes in time, we can advance further while waiting for resupply by rail,\" the dwarf reported in his calm, precise manner.\n\"Excellent. Give the order—let the troops form up. We march north,\" I said, rising from my chair. My words carried out into the cold wind howling through the cracks of the chamber.\nWithout delay, massive marching columns were formed, soon joined by the Tsar's own forces. I was struck by the size of his retinue: he had brought with him a great host of Ice Witches, easily more than a hundred. It was clear this campaign was taken with the utmost seriousness, for in the Empire such a number of wizards would rarely march together except in the most decisive of wars.\nThe march itself was swift. To my surprise, as we advanced, snow never fell directly upon our heads. The deeper we pressed north, the more the land turned white: fields blanketed, hills glazed with ice, flurries whirling in the air. And yet, our road remained clear. It did not take me long to find the reason. Drawing closer to the Ice Witches, I saw their lips murmuring incantations, the air around them alive with arcane force. They were bending the winds, driving the snowfall aside and holding the cold at bay. Step beyond their reach, and the winter struck you full in the face—a brutal contrast. Then I understood the Kislevite secret for waging war in the depths of winter.\nWe pressed on until we reached the village of Belñava, where the first camps were raised. There, the Tsar levied many locals, mostly Ungols, who added their horses to the mass of his army. That constant gathering of men made it clear Boris did not rely only on his veterans, but meant to rouse all of Kislev for this war.\nThe nights revealed even more. Several Ice Witches remained among us, ensuring the cold was kept at bay. Their power was undeniable: within their reach, water in the buckets refused to freeze and the air was bearable; step beyond their circle, and ice formed within minutes, frost covering everything it touched. That difference allowed us to rest with far more comfort than I would ever have imagined in these lands.\nThe following days passed without news from the front. The Tsar continued his tireless levies, drawing in both Gospodars and Ungols alike. He armed them quickly with the muskets I had brought and issued uniforms to grant them clearer discipline and identity within the host.\nAt last we reached Gutaidra, a small village south of Praag. Yet our course did not aim for that great city. Instead, we crossed the river swiftly and pressed into the vast northern plains. From there the horizon turned bleak and monotonous: hills crowned in white, frost-choked forests, and endless fields where nothing could be seen but snow, snow, and more snow, as far as the eye could reach.\nThough the march was bearable—the cold not yet at its worst—we skirted the mountain range of Gulinyi and turned north. It was there we first encountered the cultists of Khorne. At the start they were but riders, frenzied and blood-mad, who hurled themselves blindly against our ranks the instant they spotted us. They impaled themselves upon my pikemen and were shredded by musket fire. It was nothing but a warning of what lay further ahead.\nThe deeper north we marched, the more of them we met, bursting from every side, howling like possessed beasts and hurling themselves against us without the slightest fear.\n\"Blood for the Blood God, skulls for the Skull Throne!\" bellowed one marauder as he charged, a mob of equally deranged horsemen at his back.\n\"More of these fools… Musketeers!\" I shouted. My men formed their line at once.\n\"Wait… let them come closer… wait… Fire!\" I ordered again. The thunder of muskets cracked, riders dropped headlong into the snow. Several rose again despite shattered arms and broken legs, eyes wide with madness as they stumbled forward.\n\"Second line!\" I called coldly. The second volley tore through what remained. The fanatics collapsed, bathed in their own blood, though their cries still seemed to echo on the frozen wind.\n\"Welcome to Kislev,\" said the Tsar from atop his massive war-bear. \"I wager you have never seen the like in the Empire.\"\n\"It looks much the same as the beastmen, when they've a shaman driving them to throw their lives away against our guns,\" I answered grimly.\n\"These are not the worst,\" Boris replied. \"They are the easiest to cut down. The true terrors lie within the fortress. Steel yourself: this may well be the hardest fight of your life.\"\nHundreds of bear riders surged forward as another wave of Chaos warriors approached. For long minutes we endured assault after assault of Khornate raiders. They were little more than savages clad in crude armor, and I had honestly expected worse. But the respite did not last.\nWhen the fighting eased, we re-formed and reached the river that barred us from our goal: Fort Ostrosk. It loomed on the far bank, crusted with frost. The plan was for the Ice Witches to freeze the river so we could cross.\nAnd so they did. With power that even I found startling, the water hardened beneath our boots, and within minutes we had a bridge strong enough for the whole host to march across.\n\"Forward! Keep the formations!\" I shouted, my breath rising in pale clouds.\n\"Albrecht! Beware! They are here! Our magic falters—there are bearers of anti-magic armor nearby!\" Katarin cried from horseback, surrounded by her coven.\nI felt it at once. The temperature plummeted. Their spells weakened, and the cold bit into our skin like knives.\nAs we neared the fortress walls, the Tsar's host spread to the front. Through the blizzard I glimpsed a gleam of metal—something advancing.\n\"Damn it…\" I muttered, as a charge of Skullcrushers thundered into view, trailed by a massive horde of barbarians.\n\"Rifles! Shotguns! We'll need them against those monsters!\" I barked to my guard, who armed themselves at once.\nI drew my runic mace and braced for the clash. To the Kislevites' misfortune, the Skullcrushers were not driving at our lines—where perhaps we might have stopped them. They hurled themselves straight into the Tsar's regiments. The beasts of brass they rode were titanic, and I had little faith they could be halted easily.\n\"Come on, we must aid them!\" I cried, seizing one of Grimm's rifles. I loaded two of its heavy rounds, slung it to my saddle, and spurred Princess into the air to strike the front line.\nMy men-at-arms followed close, charging in as Kislev's winged lancers and the bear cavalry clashed head-on with the knights of Khorne. The result was carnage: bodies flung from their mounts, horses and bears tumbling across the snow, while Ice Witches cast storms of frost that froze warriors mid-stride.\nWith Princess I dove upon a Juggernaut, the brass beast ridden by a Khornate knight. My griffon caught its neck in one claw, seizing the rider's arm with the other. I raised my mace in both hands and brought it crashing down upon his helm. The blow rang in my ears, but the knight did not fall, his burning eyes fixed on me.\nA second strike shattered his helm, revealing a face twisted with mutations and scars. Before he could strike back, Princess ripped the Juggernaut's head away and flung it aside. I finished the knight with a crushing blow to the skull.\nMore pressed in, but my men-at-arms burst among them, firing shotguns and rifles point-blank, dropping several of the Skullcrushers before drawing runic swords, axes, and hammers to meet the rest.\nWith Princess I lunged upon another of the brass riders, hammering and clawing until the knight toppled from his mount. But then I saw something that chilled even me: a towering figure hewing its way through its own horde, felling allies with its axes as it came on.\n\"Damn it…\" I growled, tightening my grip on the mace. \"One blessed with far too many favors of his god is coming for us.\"\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Every one of them chose a glorious death over retreat—their widows had said as much—making our task all the easier. It didn't take long to encircle them and cut them down to the last, ending the battle swiftly.\nThe Blood God's followers honored him like brainless beasts. They abandoned the safety of the Kislevite fortress, using it instead to store their captives: a mix of slaves, local Ungols and Gospodar they had taken, along with many trolls locked in cages.\nThe priests of the Orthodoxy took charge of purifying the place and disposing of the countless dead.\nOnce it was over and victory was ours, I gathered my fallen and made arrangements for their return. They would be buried in Morr's Garden, after receiving the basic rites to keep their souls from being left defenseless before daemons—no doubt some still lingered here, considering Khorne's gaze had been upon this place.\nI pitched my tent and lay down to rest. My damned face throbbed as if I'd been struck by a daemon itself. Once the adrenaline faded, every blow the champion of Khorne had landed came crashing back on me. My right eye was swollen shut; I could barely see.\nFor long minutes I sat in silence, hearing only the wind's breath and the crackle of the fire as I sipped a potion of Shallya that dulled the pain a little.\nAt last I heard the steps of my men, the bustle of breaking camp. It seemed the winds had calmed, or perhaps the witches had regained their strength. Once Khorne's cursed armor had lost its anti-magic hold, they had been able to drive off the storm and snow again.\n\"By Ursun… what in the abyss happened to leave you like this?\" said Tsar Boris, stepping into my tent and fixing me with his stare, the one eye I could still use meeting his.\n\"I went toe to toe with a damned champion of Chaos… what else could it have been? Those knights barely withstood my blows, but that bastard outmatched me in every way. Looked like his dark god lent him a hand—he broke out of an iron prison I'd trapped him in, and this is how he left me,\" I said, glancing at the tsar.\n\"I'd heard you fought one of the knights and died. But it seems that was just nonsense, for a pack of boyars were already scheming over my daughter and how your men would be divided up…\" Boris muttered.\n\"Give me their names. Once I recover, I'll smash their faces for daring to covet my soldiers before I'm even dead,\" I snapped, sitting up on the cot.\n\"I've already seen to their punishment; don't trouble yourself with it. Fools, thinking Imperials would remain here without their lord's leadership—especially with no coin to pay them. One question, though: are you certain it was a true champion of Chaos?\" the tsar asked.\n\"Of course I am. The brute towered over me, a head taller, clad in cursed armor, wielding damned weapons. No matter how I struck him, nothing worked. It was a bloody miracle I came out alive,\" I replied, taking another sip of Shallya's potion.\n\"Bad news for you, good news for Kislev. When one of their champions falls, many try to claim the mantle. They are called northward—to where, I know not. But it always happens. And when it does, the raiders and tribes march away, hoping to be chosen as the next champion,\" said the tsar.\n\"Good news then, I suppose… What about the fortress? Usable, or too corrupted?\" I asked, warming water in the brazier and tossing in some bandages to sterilize.\n\"Yes. Apart from the poor souls inside, and the dozens of trolls they had penned there. Seems they were feeding on troll flesh. You know the absurd regeneration of those beasts—must have been their way of keeping food: prisoners who were useless for other purposes,\" said Boris.\n\"Those worshippers sure know how to survive,\" I muttered, holding my hands closer to the fire.\n\"That's cannibalism with extra steps. But I think we fought the bulk of the forces here. There may be stragglers, but I believe we can press on and retake all the forts,\" Boris replied.\n\"That's truly good news… makes it worth getting smashed so badly. My face, my chest—they're wrecked. You've no idea how those damned axes hurt, and the strength he had was monstrous,\" I said, lowering myself back onto the cot.\n\"This battle secures the north. All that remains is to march. We go tomorrow, so rest. You've earned it with merit: when we return, we'll celebrate with the finest kvass,\" said Boris, giving me a pat on the back before leaving.\nI clenched my lips at the pain still burning through my ribs and watched him step out.\n\"Blood for the…\" the whisper came again in my head.\n\"To hell with you,\" I muttered, raising my middle finger to the empty air.\nFinally, I pulled the bandages from the boiling water and let them cool in the steam outside the tent. I pressed snow to my swollen eye to numb it a little and lay back to rest.\nThe sounds of my men finally died down; I felt the cold bandage on my face as I rested after a battle that had pushed me to my physical limit.I slept with relative ease, only hearing the breathing of Princess, curled up inside her mountain of furs —the very ones she had hunted— when I sensed, through my arcane hearing, a presence approaching, followed by more footsteps.\n''What do you want, Katarin?'' I said, recognizing the armor she wore thanks to my arcane gift.\n''How do you know who it is if your eyes aren't even open?'' asked Katarin as she came closer.\n''I'm lucky… Tell me what you need. I'm a bit indisposed after being that Chaos champion's opponent,'' I replied, still with my eyelids shut.\n''I only wanted to know how you were, father told me that you were badly beaten… so the fight must have been very hard,'' said Katarin, gently touching the swelling around my eye.\n''Yes, it was a hard fight… but soon we'll march again. We must see if we can reclaim all the forts: everything suggested they were preparing for something larger, and now that their champion is dead, with no clear leader, perhaps they'll turn on each other. Your father believes they'll retreat north —every time a champion falls, they start fighting over succession—,'' I said, relaxing a bit at the cold sensation against my inflamed wounds.\n''If this helps Kislev regain its borders and defend itself from constant raids, we'll be closer. But there are still many battles ahead; this doesn't end with a single clash. We still must fight for the Motherland to prosper again,'' said Katarin, her voice softer than her usual icy tone.\n''I know. I'm not deluded: facing the ruinous powers means expecting resistance everywhere. But if we can secure a strong enough fortress and reach out to the dawi Karaks of the region, we can stop incursions through the northern pass,'' I replied, showing a faint smile.\n''Exactly. I came to talk about that. Father trusts you: you know how to deal with the dwarfs and many respect you —some even consider you a reliable ally—. That's why I want to ask you to act as ambassador to the local dawi clans: perhaps we can settle our frictions, forge an alliance, and gain help for the fortification works,'' explained Katarin.\n''I can do it. I'll be ambassador with the dawi to see what can be done. But if I present it as purely Kislevite diplomacy, they'll likely kill me: the grievances run deep. Better I go as a mediator in my own name,'' I replied.\n''Thank you… it will be of great help,'' she said, taking my hand.\n''Don't mention it… Let's just hope the march north is quick and, with luck, without more Chaos champions,'' I said.\n''Let's hope so,'' she said, squeezing my hand firmly; I felt the cold pressure on my cheek an she pulled away.\nCuriosity gnawed at me as the night went on.\n''Wait a second… those bruises are blood pooled under the skin,'' I muttered, sitting up and beginning to practice my magic.I concentrated the winds of Chamon within me and began to draw the stagnant blood from the bruises, slowly pulling it out of the skin. I felt the viscous flow shift and slide out in fine threads.\n''Good… it works. For now, it works… I should try it on mice or rabbits… maybe it could even serve as my own teacher, now that I'm stepping more into the sphere of Ghyran,'' I said as I continued extracting blood from the wounds.\nI kept using my magic to try and speed regeneration, but Chamon wasn't the ideal school for healing: what I did was closer to a leech sucking out clotted blood and moving things internally. Even so, any aid was welcome on that frozen night.\nI stopped thinking within the bubble of the arcane and began drawing instead on what I truly knew: biology, the periodic table, and how the body processes nutrients.\nI found a piece of beef with several bones still attached and used it as an experiment. I ground the bones to consume them along with the meat, even submerging them in water to boil before swallowing. I let my stomach acids do their work, breaking everything down into basic components I could manipulate with Chamon. Calcium, iron, zinc, phosphorus, magnesium… each mineral I isolated and guided with magic, forcing my body to process it faster and direct it where it was most needed.At the same time, I drew the clotted blood from my bruises and sped up nutrient absorption, repairing damaged tissue and aiding regeneration.\n''If only I had a mage of Ghyran, I could heal completely… I might even try controlling the cellular functions of my own body. But of course… how do I manage that without the Lore of Life? Difficult…'' I murmured, still using my magic to better nourish my body and expel the old blood from the wounds.\nThe swelling in my eye faded, and I regained normal sight. I made a mental note that, once I returned to Altdorf, I must seek out a mage of Ghyran to continue this research. Carefully, of course: I had no desire to repeat my former master's mistakes. But if I perfected this, we could be looking at a significant leap forward in the art of healing.\nAfter doing all I could with my body, I went back to sleep. The next day we resumed the march: Fort Ostrosk had been retaken, and several thousand men were left to rebuild it and stock it with supplies, ensuring its resilience against future attacks. Many of the Tsar's forces split to recover other forts, while we continued pushing north.\nOn the way we kept finding resistance: bands of Chaos raiders still prowling villages and forests in the region. Yet the main forts were nearly abandoned; everything suggested they had belonged to the warband of the Khorne champion we had slain, and without their leader many warriors had already vanished, retreating north.\nBoris had been right: when a champion fell, the hosts of Chaos splintered, and the lesser warbands sought the next warlord in the north. That gave us breathing room.\nThe days passed in a relentless routine of marches, skirmishes, and repairs until finally all the fortresses the Tsar had set out to recover were once more in Kislev's hands. Boris was visibly satisfied; in his eyes burned the pride of a monarch who, at last, saw part of his promises to his people fulfilled.\nIt didn't take long for the boyars to arrive. Many crowded around him, whispering in his ear, suggesting he distribute those fortresses and their lands among their dynasties, to administer them as atamans. The greed in their voices was clear: troll hunting in those regions had become a lucrative trade, and all wanted their share. The hides served as hardy coats, the fangs sold as trophies or talismans, and the blood, apparently, was sought after by alchemists and ice witches for its unusual properties.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Nearly all the warbands had vanished, marching north and leaving the area desolate. The Kislevites, though they had lost nearly five thousand men in their clash with the Chaos hordes, were satisfied with the campaign's outcome. I, on the other hand, had lost dozens of my best men to the skullcrushers; many runic armors had been damaged and numerous runic weapons shattered. Everything had to be sent back to our dawi allies so they could inspect the armor, reforge it, and return it to us, to be given to new men who would need training to wield it.\nThe hardest blow was losing some who had fought by my side for years… among the dead were those who had served both my father and me since long ago, meeting their end at the hands of knights blessed by Khorne. It was a bitter slap in the face. These weren't soldiers you could replace by handing someone a musket and teaching him the basics: they were veterans with years of experience at my side.\nMany I had already sent back to Reinsfeld to be buried, and the image of the small temple of Morr in our town came to my mind, imagining it barely keeping up with the swelling population of the dead that would now increase considerably.\nTaking advantage of the gold I still had, before returning south with the dawi to seek more gold by freeing karaks, I ordered the construction of a great temple to Morr. One can never have too much of Morr's favor. I sent instructions to my architects to raise something near the mountains: a broad necropolis where the dead of the region could be buried, and I asked the dawi for help to carve images of the god and raise mausoleums, so all would have a worthy tomb.\nWhile moving near the Kislevite camp I noticed a heated dispute. I saw Katarin seated on a throne of ice, surrounded by her ice witches, and the Tsar watching with arms crossed. Many boyars were quarreling with each other; shouts and reproaches filled the air.\nI approached Katarin and touched her shoulder. She looked at me startled, wide-eyed.\n\"Albrecht… god… how is it possible you make no sound moving with all that steel on you?\" said Katarin, recovering from the fright, as did one of the witches at her side.\n\"The ring,\" I replied.\n\"The ring… the ring… is there anything that ring doesn't do?\" said Katarin, staring at it.\n\"It helps me sleep at night; a few moments of rest feel like I've slept the whole day,\" I answered, playing with the finger where the band gleamed. Katarin ran her hand over her face and shook her head.\n\"An arcane artifact of great power… in the hands of a man,\" murmured one of the ice witches.\n\"No one asked your opinion…\" I said, ignoring her, sparing her the threat of filling her throat with molten iron.\nI focused again on Katarin and on the boyars' conflict. \"What's going on?\" I asked calmly.\n\"Fights over who will be the new military commander of the forts —or rather, who will be the superior over all the commanders of the forts,\" Katarin explained.\n\"They're fighting over that?\" I asked, raising a brow, surprised they disputed something I would immediately avoid for how costly it is to maintain men in a fort.\n\"Father will pay the salaries, so it's a coveted position for a boyar: his personal troops would be maintained by the Tsar. Besides, there are plans to repopulate the area, and when that happens, who do you think will take control of the villages once thousands return to the fields and steppes?\" said Katarin calmly, watching the conflict.\n\"They're fighting over frozen lands… seriously,\" I said, leaning against the ice throne beside Katarin.\n\"In the mountains of the region there are valuable minerals that haven't been exploited for decades due to the obvious problems we have reclaiming the more remote areas of Praag, Erengrad, and Kislev. Moreover, whoever controls the army gains the lucrative troll-hunting trade,\" added Katarin.\n\"And why don't you secure it yourselves? Wouldn't that be best?\" I asked, still leaning, hearing the ice creak under my weight.\n\"Many boyars still don't fully support the Tsar; several have secessionist leanings. For example in Praag, where the Ungols and the Roppsmens have tried more than once to slip free of Kislev's yoke. For that reason we can't hoard all the power; we'd face another rebellion. We must concede a little to the boyars: leave a military commander in place —but we need to see who the candidates are and if any are worth it,\" concluded Katarin.\n\"Wouldn't it be better to give it to an experienced military commander? I mean, better that than putting a boyar there who may have no idea what it is to command a frontier this important,\" I said, nearly toppling as I broke part of the throne I leaned on.\n\"Ha… that would be ideal, but it depends heavily on the candidates. And right now it's being decided who they'll be. Father angered the boyars a great deal by pulling so many out of their military posts, so this isn't something we can press further,\" said Katarin.\n\"I see… a complicated fight from the looks of it,\" I said, folding my arms.\n\"Yes, many fights, especially now that they feel secure since what bound them to us has vanished. Although it was good you defeated the Chaos champion in single combat, the problem is that now, if someone threatens us, the boyars will hardly obey… By the way, it seems some envoys managed to arrange a meeting with the Dwarf King of Kraka Ravnsvake to negotiate. Apparently his anger against us… or rather against our ancestors, has cooled. But still, I prefer to entrust the negotiations to you, rather than let father attempt it and ruin everything,\" said Katarin.\n\"Considering how your father is, he'd probably do fine. If these dawi are like the ones in the south, his personality should be more than enough to calm them,\" I replied.\n\"Just make sure to calm them, and we'll see what happens. They shouldn't take long to arrive,\" Katarin finished.\nWhile I kept watching the boyars continue their verbal brawl over who was most worthy to be the military commander of the area, news arrived that the Dwarf King of Kraka Ravnsvake himself had come in person with his retinue.\nI quickly fetched something I always carried to keep the dawi travelling with me in good spirits: a few fine barrels of Bugman's ale, something no sane dawi could resist.\nI watched a mobile throne, borne by four sturdy dawi, glide forward without trouble as a large contingent of warriors drew near. There were many Kislevites around me—some hoping to stab me if anything went wrong, others ready to say I had not done enough.\nThe warriors set the throne down and the dawi king sat, fixing his gaze on me.\"Friends of the Empire,\" I said in Reikspiel.\nThe dawi king narrowed his eyes and looked me over. \"You speak the tongue of that umgi Magnus… yet I would know more of where you obtained that runic gromril armor… or rather, all your weapons,\" the king said.\n\"Yes, Magnus the Pious, former Emperor of the Empire,\" I answered, stepping a little closer to the throne. \"From our mountain allies, honorable king. This ring—given by the dawi people with the leave of High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer of Karaz-a-Karak, for aiding him in reclaiming his holds. Part of my armor was gifted by the Grundkaraz clan of the Grey Mountains, for I am a personal friend of their thane. And my mace is a personal gift from High King Thorgrim,\" I said, indicating each piece of my runic kit.\n\"An umgi of honour, it seems… I see why those manlings chose you…\" the king observed.\n\"Indeed… The road must have been long and wearisome. May I first offer you a draught of a fine ale?\" I asked, lifting a barrel of Bugman's.\n\"Ha… no human ale could ever…\" The king began to sniff, as did all his men, when I opened the barrel and the strong scent of Bugman's filled the air. \"That is…\" he said, licking his lips. \"Bugman's ale?\"\n\"It is, friends of the Empire. I always carry a few barrels so my dawi followers may relax with the finest ale in the world,\" I said as one of my men poured a generous mug.\nThe king was served promptly, as were the throne-bearers who, still supporting the throne with one arm, drank eagerly with the other, savouring every swallow. Even the king himself seemed entranced by the ale.\n\"Ah… decades since I last tasted this… it takes me back to my youth, when I drank with that umgi Magnus and the king of Karak Kadrim… after our battle,\" the dawi king said.\n\"I am glad to hear it… I will make sure to gift you some of the barrels I have, my king. Now, to our business: I would like to know what has transpired with the Kislevites, for I understand you have many wrongs recorded in your Dammaz Kron against them, and I would see whether they may be set right so our peoples can stand together against the ruinous powers,\" I said as my men brought forward more barrels.\n\"Yes… I remember well… those manlings. Their offences are many. After our aid in the war, they never answered our call when the hordes of Chaos came; their ataman broke the oaths of our treaties, took our gold yet sent no cattle, no harvests, nor the ore. Those manlings rifled dawi ruins, stealing treasures of our folk after refusing to lift a hand in aid… they handed us gold coins plated in tin as payment,\" the dawi king said.\nI bowed my head and turned to the boyars watching me. \"I cannot excuse these wrongs, my king… forgive me for not knowing your name,\" I said, searching for a way to mend the breach.\n\"Haarkon Vikramson,\" the king replied with pride.\n\"Thank you, King Haarkon Vikramson… Albrecht von Reinsfeld, Elector Count of the Westerland and Prince of Marienburg,\" I answered.\n\"I greet you, imperial noble,\" King Haarkon said.\n\"As you will. I cannot defend the Kislevites' deeds… especially the plunder… such acts are near unforgivable. I nearly marched on Kislev when they plundered Imperial soil… yet there is one thing that binds us: our common foe grows stronger. I do not ask you to forget, but I ask you, King Haarkon, that if possible we find a way to have these matters settled. I give you my word that if they again wrong the honourable dawi people, I shall personally see them punished,\" I said, hand over heart as I spoke to the dawi.\n\"A fair reckoning is what I demand: every runic artifact now in the hands of those deceitful manlings must be returned to the dawi, along with gold for what they cheated us of… and, above all, compensation for failing to answer our call to arms,\" King Haarkon declared.\nI inclined myself at his words and thought coldly about how to heal that wound. Then I took the initiative to build a bridge.\n\"I will see what can be done, King Haarkon. I ask that you bear in mind that Kislev has suffered greatly, that all the tsar's efforts have been poured into reclaiming their lands, and perhaps for that reason they could not answer the summons or fulfil their obligations… for the moment, accept these barrels of ale as a personal gift from me,\" I said, stepping back to speak with the tsar.\nKing Haarkon nodded and his men wasted no time falling upon the barrels. The tension in the hall eased slightly; the warm, bitter scent of Bugman's drifted through the chamber like a temporary balm.\nI then went to Tsar Boris. When he learned the cause of the dawi's complaint, his face darkened with anger: theft from the dawi was a grave matter, and the dawi do not forgive lightly. His ire fell upon several boyars who had administered the lands before the fall of the forts. We soon identified the descendants of the guilty: the plunder had taken place generations past.\nI demanded the return of the runic relics. Some boyars, under the tsar's stern gaze, handed their pieces over quickly. Those who refused, claiming family heirlooms, received exemplary punishment: we knocked out several of their teeth with fists and then led them to King Haarkon's feet, forcing them to beg forgiveness with their faces buried in the snow. The scene was harsh, but effective: few had the stomach to defy the dawi face to face, and fewer still beneath the tsar's stare.\nHaarkon showed magnanimity: he asked only for the return of the cheated gold—the silver coins plated in tin—and that the promised deliveries of resources be made good. After a few more mugs, his fury eased enough to accept an arrangement. He promised to strike the entries from his Dammaz Kron if what was owed was restored.\nMy intervention likely saved Kislev hundreds of thousands of crowns and, most importantly, smoothed over a rift that might have ended in open war between our allies. We were not negotiating from a lost position; there was room to restore trust.\nWhat drew my attention most were Haarkon's clan smithcraft and runes: they were not the common runes of the southern dawi. I noticed rings and amulets that, the king said, kept corruption at bay—not mere protective tokens, but true talismans against putrescence. That piqued my curiosity: there was runic knowledge here beyond the usual, and its possible application was far too valuable to ignore.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I must say your rune-craft has greatly impressed me. I move among the circles of the mountain rune-smiths and have leave from High King Thorgrim to purchase runic artefacts, yet the runes on your rings have caught my keenest attention. That ability of your smiths to fashion runes that keep Chaos at bay… I admit I covet it. I wondered if it might be possible to buy rings from your hold,\" I said, bowing my head while he lounged on his throne and drank.\nThe king laughed with pleasure and nodded. \"Ah… ha, ha. You have good eyes, umgi, to appreciate the workmanship of my rune-smiths. And since you are judged trustworthy —enough that other kings and thanes might trust you— I will consider selling you a runic ring bearing the rune that drives out Chaos, which our clan laboured long to craft so our road would be less touched by the influence of the ruinous powers,\" he said, pausing to sip his ale.\nI was taken aback by his generosity. \"Ah, if that is so, honourable dawi king… it is that I do not need only one…\"\n\"How many do you need, two… three? We may come to terms,\" King Haarkon asked.\nI fixed him with a steady look and replied calmly, \"About… fifty thousand rings.\"\nThe king's eyes bulged and he nearly let his mug fall. \"Fifty thousand… fifty thousand rings… umgi, I do not think you have the gold to buy ten of them,\" he said, regaining his composure.\n\"You are certainly right, yet I would propose a long-term exchange of resources at the pace your smiths can produce them. For example, I can procure hundreds of barrels of Bugman's ale within hours, or deliver vast quantities of iron and coal so your forges may labour without pause. I may not possess the gold now, but if we agree on monthly payments, it is entirely feasible,\" I said with a smile.\nThe king thought for a moment. \"Yes… but the number… I would have to set every rune-smith of mine to work without rest to fulfil such an order. It is too many rings… and why do you want so many?\" he asked.\nI answered with honesty: \"For my soldiers. If every man wears that ring, they need not fear falling prey to the lure of the corrupting powers. There is no price too high to guarantee my men's safety against the ruinous powers and to safeguard their souls from being claimed.\"\n\"A noble aim,\" the king admitted. \"I must speak with my Master of Runes to see how many such rings we can produce. They are not the simplest of artefacts, but I ask this be kept secret among our rune-masters; we have laboured long to make the rune in question.\"\n\"I understand. How much would one ring cost, so I may have a sense?\" I asked, steepling my hands, pleased he considered it.\n\"Do you trade in Imperial gold crowns? If so, five hundred of those coins is fair for such work; if you keep to the standard from when we met Magnus the Pious there should be no trouble trading between our peoples,\" King Haarkon said.\n\"Perfect. I think I can pay in instalments if we do it by the month. I only need to know how many rings your clan can produce and I will ensure they have all they need at their holds. You may count on my trade routes to the southern Karak dawi for moving supplies, and, above all, Bugman's ale,\" I replied serenely as I watched him.\nThe king nodded. \"We shall consider it, umgi.\"\n\"Very well. I can pay upfront for two rings to begin,\" I offered, eager to see if any were available.\nOne of the warriors who bore the throne fetched a runic coffer. When opened, several items were shown: two rings were taken out and offered. \"There you are, only the payment remains,\" the king said.\nI immediately sent my men to fetch the pay chests from my campaign tents. In minutes they returned with two chests heavy with gold and we exchanged them for the dawi rings: one clearly larger, meant to be worn over armour; the other for use off-armour.\nI quickly slipped the larger ring on. One is never wholly safe from Chaos, and I was determined not to fall for Khorne's crude attempt to lure me into finishing the phrase he whispers in my ear.\nSatisfied with the exchange, I returned to the camp where the boyars' quarrels continued over who should hold military command of the region.\nThe shouts of the boyars still rang across the camp as they argued who deserved the fortress, but I took the chance to impose order. I organised my troops, inspected the state of our kit, gathered powder and concentrated supplies — our march north had cut us off from Kislev's supply lines. I also set down preliminary plans for a future railway to Praag. I had no intention of laying track here yet; nothing promised its safety. Investing such works in this region would be folly if Chaos might take it. For now, Praag would be as far as we dared think.\nDays passed and the boyars kept squabbling, trading accusations and claiming old lineage or valor from the last stand against the Chaos host. In truth their pleas were pride and greed: each wanted the fortress for the gain it would bring\n\"So tell me, Boris, what now? Do you plan another campaign or may I return home?\" I asked, leaning against one of the pavilion posts.\n\"I am planning a campaign into Troll Country, as far as the Groene and into the mountains. That would close the passes toward Kislev and prevent further raids. The problem will be building forts in that region: first we must exterminate the trolls that infest it, otherwise they will constantly strike our supply lines. I mean to march there. Your presence is not indispensable, but your men would be of great use… those weapons of yours that felled Chaos knights would serve us well,\" the tsar answered in a grave tone.\n\"'It will be difficult. Even with the Ice Witches, the problem will still be supplies. Prices are rising: the Empire is short of grain and, until the next harvest, keeping an army here in Kislev is ruinously expensive.'\"\n\"I understand. We are the same. Last year's harvest was poor and we are stretching what little we have to sustain the campaigns. I cannot spend all my coin on food; I must reserve resources to extend roads and prepare land where the ungols may settle. They are willing to repopulate these regions.\"\n\"'Good… but remember what we agreed before. We took those mountains back, so I expect iron to begin flowing into my lands in earnest so I may smelt it into steel. Also wood and pelts. All that will allow me to strengthen my position in the Imperial market, just now when demand for steel has soared thanks to arms and armour production.'\"\n\"We will keep our word. Once families settle, the miners will begin their work and the woodcutters will clear workable forests. Winter hunting will furnish pelts in great numbers, and by the end of the year you shall receive them as agreed. I will see that the hunters pay you their dues in furs.\"\n\"With that I can refill my coffers. I'm running dry after so long on campaign, and my men must be weary from so much marching. We need a respite.\" As i spoke,i scanned the maps spread before me\n\"If we are lucky they will be occupied for many months until a new champion takes the post of the one you slew, so I can take my time. I do not need to hurry things. If you wish, you may return to your lands at once, since I understand you have business there. I will not take more of your time,\" Tsar Boris said, nodding.\n\"Very well, thank you for everything. I hope I was of help… though they nearly beat me to death. Will you require my aid next year or will you manage?\" I asked before leaving the campaign tent.\n\"I will call on you if anything occurs, but if all goes well and the troll hunts are favourable, we may speak of no longer reclaiming the motherland's territories but of holding the borders as they should be. Your help should be more in kind: more firearms, powder and cannon to garrison the fortresses — cannon that do not come from pirates or Imperial smuggling. Dwarven-made guns are hard to procure, and Imperial ones even more so,\" the tsar answered gravely.\n\"I'll see what I can do. Remember those things are not cheap, and that gift I gave you was a one-off. The rest you will have to pay for; I cannot keep draining my private accounts for your lands at present,\" I replied as I walked out.\n\"Have a safe journey and may your harvests be plentiful. We shall see if purchases are feasible this year; I will need to watch the boyars if they fancy stealing Ostermark's lands again,\" Boris said as he left.\nHurrying, I went to find Katarin inside the fortress we had retaken; with her magic she was filling gaps and mending ice torsions — a quick repair to prevent any breach until a full restoration could be made.\n\"Katarin,\" I said, tossing her a runic ring.\nShe turned and caught it on the fly. \"Is this another ring like yours?\" she asked, studying the piece.\n\"No. Mine comes from the War of the Beard, from the dawi against the elves; it is far older. This one, however, is simply a ring that helps ward off corruption. Take it — a gift,\" I said, stepping toward her.\n\"It's a bit large, but with gloves it will fit. Thank you for the gift,\" she answered more softly, slipping the ring on her hand.\n\"Your father has authorised my return to Altdorf; we must speak with the Supreme Patriarch and with the Emperor. I also want to oversee the harvest season on my estates, to see how the sowing fared in the reclaimed swamplands of the Westerlands — in case I can recover part of my investment,\" I said, looking down from the fortress wall.\n\"When will we return to Kislev?\" Katarin asked at once.\n\"Who knows. Your father says that for now he only needs financial backing: if he can establish forts and hold the passes, he will require nothing more than the shipment of arms and cannon to defend them. Perhaps in a couple of years; maybe next year I will head south again,\" I explained, careful not to slip on the ice covering the fortress rock.\n\"Again with the princes?\" Katarin raised an eyebrow.\n\"No: to Karaz Ankor. If all is stable among the princes, we shall march to Karak Eight Peaks and see what we can achieve in that titanic campaign to recover one of the dawi's most important karaks,\" I replied.\n\"It would not be possible to rest a little at least… we've been running for too long, with no more than a few days in the fortresses you took by force. It is exhausting,\" Katarin said.\n\"I'll see what I can arrange. We will likely spend the early months of winter in relative quiet, but unless my enterprises bring in stratospheric returns, I will have to go back to raise funds,\" I answered, pointing to the fortress exit. She accompanied me as we began to prepare to return to the Empire.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

With the best grades… perfect, in fact. Every exam he sat, he passed. I told you, Mother, he was going to go far,\" Alphonse said between bites of pie, still speaking with his mouth full.\n\"Let's hope you finish your studies soon as well,\" his mother replied, casting him a stern look as she remembered he had failed his last exam.\n\"Eh… the professor has it in for me, doesn't she, Heinrich? I answered that question about the mortar composition needed to reinforce a bridge over the Reik correctly, but she wanted every technical detail as if it were a Dwarf treatise,\" Alphonse said, wiping his mouth with a napkin, uncomfortable.\n\"Well… it was certainly a difficult question; even I struggled with it. But you'll have another chance next week. Get back to your books and, with Verena's wisdom, we'll be celebrating your engineering degree together soon,\" I encouraged him with a calm smile.\n\"Speak for yourself… You even managed to graduate in Imperial history at the same time. The nobles will fight to hire you to educate their children, or perhaps they'll try to keep you on as a professor at the university,\" Alphonse said, raising his glass and drinking in one go.\n\"And what do you plan to do for now, Heinrich? They'll hand you the parchment soon and the world will open up for you. By the way, will your parents attend the ceremony? I'd love to meet the family that raised such a diligent young man,\" Alphonse's mother asked, pinching my cheek affectionately.\n\"Ha, ha, ha… They won't be able to come, they're too busy…,\" I answered, gently pulling her hand away, uncomfortable under her inquisitive gaze.\n\"How is it possible your parents won't be present at such an important moment? It's not every day someone graduates with two degrees at once,\" she said, hands on her hips, indignant.\n\"There's nothing to worry about… My parents… well, especially my father, never took an interest in me. That's life. I understand it now. All I can do is look forward, work hard, and repay you —who have been with me— for all the support you've given me,\" I said, taking Alphonse's mother's hand firmly.\n\"Then marry my sister already, will you? She doesn't know what else to do to get your attention,\" Alphonse blurted in a teasing tone.\n\"I… I was only concerned with my studies. I barely had enough to pay tuition and buy books. I couldn't afford to think of anything else. Besides, I don't think I'm what you say,\" I replied, somewhat nervous.\n\"Are you joking? The walks in the park, the invitations to the Festag…\" Alphonse arched an eyebrow. \"And stop being so humble, idiot… you drove all our classmates crazy, even the teachers. You're the tallest man I've seen and, without much exercise, you've got a physique I envy,\" he grunted, annoyance on his face.\n\"Alphonse!\" his mother scolded, striking his head with a wooden spoon. \"Those aren't ways to speak to Heinrich. Excuse him, he says foolish things at times.\"\n\"Don't worry. He's my friend for a reason,\" I replied with a weary smile.\n\"Come on, Heinrich, eat something too. You must be hungry,\" she insisted, serving me a generous slice of pie.\nAs I ate, I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. For the first time I could tell myself I was free of my father's yoke, even though his shadow still clung to my skin: many nights I felt his hands on my shoulders, ready to humiliate me or subject me to his brutal trainings meant to break anyone he deemed weak. Those memories burned, but they no longer defined me. Fate, in its cruelty, had taken him as well; they killed him like a dog while he defended himself, and a part of me, twisted though it was, felt liberated.\nI won't deny that, tucked in a corner of my chest, there was a wish that he had kept breathing: I wanted to see him one last time, to rub it in his face —with the parchments and my grades, with proof that I did not need his name or his titles— so he would realize I could stand on my own merits. The gods, in their whim, had given me a healthy body, strength, and the mind with which I opened doors that would have been closed to him. I intended to use all of that as efficiently as possible.\nThe room, still full of friends and their family, felt strangely empty: that brute who had been my father was no longer there to acknowledge my triumph, and the contradiction left a bitter taste. I thought of the family catacombs where, probably, his body was now little more than a skeleton; the image produced a cold calm in me. My surname was a prison that would haunt me all my life, a mark difficult to erase —above all because of my brother, the one everyone knew, who had become the embodiment of what our father expected of me— and that was another blow that did not wound in the way I had expected.\nThere was no place in Altdorf where the name Reinsfeld was not heard; the city paper reminded me of it again and again, like an invisible chain that never let go.\n\"Thank you very much for everything. If you'll excuse me, I need to rest,\" I said, standing from the table.\n\"Of course, Heinrich… you must be tired. And you, lazy one, go study; you better answer correctly next time or I won't be so kind to you,\" Alphonse's mother said, raising her wooden spoon.\nI returned to the room they had been letting me use. At first I had paid with the little gold my father left —just enough to cover tuition and some books, but not enough to live in the city. That's why I had to save every coin… until Alphonse's family, with genuine kindness, decided not to charge me for the lodging any longer.\nI lit the small stove in the corner and pulled out some clippings from the city newspaper I had kept in a drawer. I stared at the first one and read it softly under my breath.\n\"'Young squire kills a Grail Knight; possible youngest member of the Reiksguard'…\" I murmured, remembering Wilhelm. My fallen brother. Back then, Father was not yet the monster I would later come to know; he was strict, yes, but different. Wilhelm's death changed everything.\nI threw the clipping into the fire and watched as the flames devoured it.\n\"'Victory at Monfort. The Imperial army achieves an overwhelming victory and storms the castle under the command of a young officer of the von Reinsfeld family'…\" I said bitterly before tossing it into the flames as well.\n\"'The great cleansing. Seasoned commander Albrecht von Reinsfeld leads the Drakwald hunt, reaching extraordinary numbers'…\" I continued, throwing the sheet into the fire.\n\"'Massacre in Marienburg. Violent clash between Imperial forces and the secessionist city; thousands of civilians dead'…\" I read quietly, feeling a chill run down my spine. \"Father created his monster. One who, even in his macabre vision of the world, might have made him proud.\"\n\"'New Elector Count… von Reinsfeld'…\" I said through clenched teeth as I threw the clipping in. \"Seeing this legitimized everything I suffered. My brother went through the same hell… and chose to become what Father always wanted.\"\nOne after another, the papers burned in the fire.\n\"'Conqueror of Bretonnia, Shield of the Empire, Champion of Sigmar, Restorer of the Hammer…'\" I recited in anger, hurling each title into the flames.\nI had hoped he would one day fall in battle, even if my brother had never harmed me directly. But he was the living bond to the monster, and I wished his legacy would collapse. Yet the gods proved him right. His brutality was recognized, his methods imitated, his name exalted.\nI took a deep breath as I watched the flames consume it all.\"I am free of Father's legacy,\" I told myself in silence. \"Perhaps I will inherit nothing, perhaps I will always remain the disinherited… but I have something he could never take from me: my freedom.\"\nThat night I slept more peacefully than ever, feeling, for the first time in years, unburdened by the weight of the man I once called Father.\nFor the first time I had time to help Alphonse's family. Although I still didn't have the degree that would allow me to work at the university, I was earning several silver coins teaching merchant children the basic subjects they would need to enter in the future. That was how I earned my bread and contributed to the household that had supported me so much.\nThe days passed, and luckily, Alphonse managed to pass his exam on his final attempt. His mother made sure he did nothing but study: no taverns, no courting the girl who distracted him. Only books until exhaustion. At last he succeeded, and now both of us were at the ceremony.\nAll of Alphonse's family was there. On my side, no one. I did not expect my brother; he had surely made sure no trace of me remained —to him, I was a failure. And my mother… she had been dead for years.\nThe dean began handing out diplomas one by one, each bearing the Emperor's seal.\n\"Heinrich von Reinsfeld!\" he announced solemnly.\nI froze when I heard the surname. I had enrolled simply as Heinrich.\n\"Heinrich von Reinsfeld!\" the dean repeated, looking at me intently.\n\"Damn it…\" I muttered, gritting my teeth as I stepped forward, feeling every gaze on me.\nThe dean extended his hand.\n\"Why is my surname on the diploma? I no longer bear that name,\" I said, glaring at him.\n\"It is the one under which you registered at the university,\" he replied, not withdrawing his hand.\nI took the diploma from his grasp, but I did not shake his hand.\nI turned and walked away. The entire ceremony had turned bitter. The parchment that was supposed to symbolize my freedom was tainted with the name of the monster I had spent my whole life trying to escape.\n\"Congratulations, Heinrich…\" said Alphonse's mother with a proud smile.\n\"Why didn't you tell us you were a noble?\" asked Alphonse, turning his head in visible confusion.\n\"Because there was no need to say it, honestly,\" I answered, my voice still edged with anger.\n\"Reinsfeld… isn't that… the Champion of Sigmar?\" said Alphonse's father, watching me closely.\n\"Forget it, will you? It's only a surname,\" I replied with a forced smile, trying to close the subject.\nWe returned to Alphonse's house, where there was another small celebration. But inside I burned with frustration that all my years of effort to conceal my family ties had been revealed so suddenly, in front of everyone.\nThe next day I took the court documents to the University of Altdorf to demand that the surname be removed from my diploma and a new one issued. I presented the papers proving that I had officially renounced my family name, and that although I was noble by birth, I was no longer part of the von Reinsfeld. I was simply Heinrich.\nThe matter was resolved quickly. The judges had already left everything in order, so the university only updated the diploma and handed it back to me, the name now clean.\nI left the university with the document in hand and, without wasting time, went to the job boards of the same university and the Altdorf town hall to inquire about positions where my skills could be of use.\nEverything seemed to be going well. Barely minutes after I had submitted my papers, I was already being called back with an offer. To my surprise, it was the dean himself who sought me out with a position: a prestigious appointment as professor of Imperial History.\nI am not blind to my merits, but I knew very well that no one fresh out of university was offered fifty crowns a month to teach such a complex course. When I tried to probe for the reason, the dean merely said it was by direct order of the Emperor: to hire the best, regardless of age.\nOf course, I accepted. But that explanation did not quiet the unease in my chest. I could not shake the thought that all of this had something, in one way or another, to do with my brother.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Before, it took entire journeys on horseback, without rest. Now it's all reduced to just a few hours.\"\nKatarin remained stoic, her eyes fixed on the fields. \"A great creation of the dwarfs,\" she replied calmly, watching as the towers of Altdorf began to rise on the horizon.\n\"At last we'll be able to rest a little in the city. But first of all I'll request an audience with the Supreme Patriarch to resolve the matter of our magical licenses. Until then, I ask you not to use your magic inside Altdorf. Afterwards, we'll travel to Reinsfeld to oversee the harvest,\" I said as the imperial walls drew near.\n\"And what about our marriage?\" Katarin retorted, turning toward me with a stern expression. \"My father is growing more nervous that the ceremony hasn't yet taken place. The sooner it is consummated, the sooner the boyars will fall silent and their complaints will cease.\"\n\"Next year,\" I answered calmly. \"The Grand Theogonist has offered to officiate the ceremony. It will be a huge event and will require preparation. I don't think you'll mind waiting a little, will you?\"\n\"I had hoped it would be held in a temple of Ursun… it will be a problem for everything to take place under Sigmar's standards,\" said Katarin with an icy tone.\n\"Ah, no. That is non-negotiable,\" I replied, meeting her gaze. \"The ceremony will be under the Cult of Sigmar. I'm not going to deal with questions from my own priests as to why I accepted a marriage before Ursun or the Kislevite Orthodoxy.\"\n\"And don't you think it will also be a problem for me to accept a ceremony under the Cult of Sigmar?\" she pressed, her eyes never leaving mine.\n\"Listen… I'm paying for the defense of your people. Twenty thousand weapons aren't given away. Don't you think the least Kislev can offer is a bit of sacrifice?\" I replied in a dry voice.\n\"Kislev needs stability. And with this, we give the boyars and the cults reasons to complain openly against the Tsar. You have political capital to resist the blow, Kislev does not,\" Katarin answered firmly.\n\"Bah… always asking, asking, asking. Fine, we'll find a middle ground: two ceremonies. One in Altdorf and another in Kislev. Let them complain all they want—at least each cult can boast it officiated the marriage.\"\nKatarin's expression softened a little, even allowing a faint smile to escape. \"That seems acceptable,\" she conceded.\nSilence returned as the train entered the station. Thousands of my soldiers disembarked immediately, forming up with discipline before I temporarily dismissed them. Many were from Altdorf and ran to reunite with their families after months of campaigning against the beastmen and the princes. They returned with bags full: gold plundered from frontier towns, Cathayan coins seized at tolls. Others, the men from Reinsfeld, awaited the next train to carry them back home.\nSeveral convoys were still to arrive, but within a few days my entire army would be back, far from Kislev's brutal winter.\nWith the men already dispatched, I wasted no time and went to seek the Supreme Patriarch. It was the most important matter.\nThe trail led me to the Bright Order, where the current Patriarch resided. In the Empire, he who rules in the world of magic is always the greatest battle wizard, and that title now rested with a sorcerer of the Bright Order. We were speaking, then, of the most powerful man in arcane arts in the Empire—and also one of the most temperamental, for his order was known for failing to control their emotions. I imagined the meeting could turn rough if I began to demand too much.\nAccompanied by some of my men, I crossed into the northern district, where the Colleges of Magic stood. Upon reaching the Bright College, the sensation was immediate: I could feel the energy of dozens of wizards practicing or forging arcane artifacts to sell and finance their studies.\nThe place, however, didn't resemble an academic institution so much as a forge of the dawi zharr. The walls were blackened, the towers spat constant bursts of flame into the air, and a stench of smoke clung to every corner. As soon as I crossed the magical barrier that protected the complex, the smell became suffocating. And I couldn't help but think that perhaps that defense was not there to protect them… but to shield the rest of the city from what happened inside.\nDespite the suffocating haze of smoke that enveloped the entrance, I pressed forward into the college. An apprentice of the Lore of Fire, his face blackened with soot, stood guard over the premises.\n\"Who is it?\" he growled, raising his staff wrapped in flames and bringing its glow close to the steel of my helm.\n\"The Elector Count of the Westerlands,\" I answered firmly. \"I need to speak with the Supreme Patriarch. I understand he is not at the Emperor's palace.\"\n\"This way… we've been expecting you for months,\" said the apprentice, stepping aside and leading me through the corridors.\nThe moment I crossed the threshold, the suffocating sensation vanished. Inside, one could breathe normally, as if the smoke remained outside by some enchantment. Along the corridors, several wizards practiced their arts: I saw fiery projectiles crashing against practice dummies and spells exploding with shockwaves that made the walls tremble. The force of some incantations was such that it seemed the building itself remained standing out of sheer stubbornness.\nThe apprentice led me through a maze of corridors and staircases. With every floor we climbed, the heat became unbearable; soon I heard several of my men muttering complaints, stifled by the burning air that grew heavier with each step. I felt it myself: it was like ascending inside a furnace.\nAt last we reached a wide chamber. There awaited the Supreme Patriarch, seated on a chair of blackened stone, watching me intently. The assistant shut the doors behind me, leaving my men outside. Now it was just him and me.\n\"So, you are the wizard…,\" he said, fixing his gaze upon me. His voice dripped with irony. \"When one of Sigmar's priests told me that the Champion of Sigmar had received the gift of magic, I didn't believe it. But I sense a faint arcane presence in you… though it could just as well be a trick of the Cult, a lie to cover their champion. It would be very shameful if Sigmar's chosen turned out to be a sorcerer.\" His hair's tips shimmered like fire as he spoke.\n\"It's the truth. I even had the honor of speaking with Sigmar himself; he sent a vision of our conversation to the Grand Theogonist. Sounds almost like heresy, doesn't it, Supreme Patriarch?\" I said, locking my eyes on him.\nThe ironic smile faded, and his face hardened with evident anger. \"Well… how interesting. Very well, we have much to teach you, shaman wizard,\" the Supreme Patriarch retorted.\n\"I suppose so. I would, however, like to be granted the license as soon as possible so I can move freely and comply with the city's regulations—one as well for my future wife and her companions,\" I said, stepping forward and attempting to sit in one of the chairs before him.\n\"When you complete your long training, we will grant you that permit. Until then, you must attend and live in the Golden Order until you fully master your powers. Moreover, those women you mention must undergo rigorous testing: records already show the use of their kind of magic in the forests of Reikland,\" replied the Patriarch, pacing among the shelves of his study.\n\"It is also clear you must renounce your titles to devote yourself entirely to the arcane arts. We cannot allow a noble sorcerer with feudal interests; that would bring us problems. Before entering the Golden College, decide who will govern the lands you hold,\" he added gravely.\nI laughed dryly. \"Ha, ha… good joke. Patriarch, I never thought anyone from the Bright College could be so amusing.\"\n\"This is not a joke. It is an order,\" he said, without a trace of humor.\n\"Well, it's not going to happen. Not a chance,\" I replied, relaxed, watching as sparks danced at the tips of his hair. \"I insist: I demand the permits for magical use.\"\n\"You will not receive them. I will not grant a license without rigorous training within the Empire. Either you submit to instruction, or—\" the Patriarch snapped.\n\"Or what? Let me remind you, you are speaking to Sigmar's Champion. Chosen by the god himself. Unlike you, my magic comes directly from Sigmar. Any attempt to persecute or subjugate me will end with the Cult of Sigmar driving you back into hiding, hunted once more. Believe me. I have the gold and influence to proscribe you and force you to scurry like rats. So tell me—what will you do? Unlike you, I will not be hunted. My power is a gift from the God of Humanity,\" I said, staring at him with deadly seriousness.\nThe Patriarch fell silent for several seconds. The flames dancing in his hair's tips snuffed out all at once.\n\"So once again—I need my permits issued immediately. I'll overlook your earlier remarks. Unless, of course, you like the idea of being pursued across the Empire for attempting to defy Sigmar's will,\" I said with a bitter smile.\nThe Patriarch stood motionless. He seemed like a statue. Slowly, fire returned to the ends of his hair. His hand crept toward an iron quill on the desk.\nFor an instant, calm returned to his face. \"No. The answer remains no. You will submit to the training as required. This is not negotiable. I will not jeopardize the rules that have kept wizards within the Empire for years,\" the Patriarch said firmly.\n\"Fine. I suppose there's nothing more to discuss. You'll hear from me soon. Don't be surprised if you find an army of Templars at the college gates—they'll be eager to ask what you're trying to do,\" I replied, rising and walking to the door.\nI opened it and stepped out. My men followed, still complaining of the unbearable heat. I wasn't too concerned. I could go directly to the Emperor. With the Grand Theogonist's support, we would create a new College of Magic. Problem solved. It would scandalize the other wizards, yes—but I would not lock myself away for years to learn what I already mastered better than many veterans of the college.\nWithout wasting time, I headed for the Imperial Palace. I had to inform the Emperor of my intentions. Then, ask the Grand Theogonist to support the founding of a new college. That way I would be accredited as a wizard within the Empire and avoid further disputes with the Patriarch.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

At times I didn't even know if the information was reliable or if someone was mocking me.\"\n\"I'm not going to die that easily. Well… they almost killed me in Kislev. But aside from that, I was never close to dying in battle. You should review your network of informants. They don't seem very reliable if they told you several times that I had fallen in combat,\" I replied coldly.\n\"What happened in Kislev?\" asked the Imperial Prince from behind me, his voice carrying obvious interest.\n\"I fought a champion of Chaos. The ones in red armor who cry out for blood every moment. We fought hand-to-hand. Punches, kicks, tackles. He rammed me with his head. Even when it seemed I was about to kill him, the man went berserk and we went at each other again. Ha, ha, ha. It was a good fight. If I hadn't won, and if I hadn't had my army backing me up, it would have gone very differently. The man was tough, very tough,\" I said, finding the bright side of a near-death encounter.\n\"Albrecht, please… have an heir already. Find a mistress or consummate your marriage. I cannot go on watching you march from battle to battle. Each absence gives me stomach pains and endless worries. Think about what would happen if you were to die. The complaints of the nobles. The attempts to forge documents. The accusations that you had a romance and tried to pass off another man's children as your own,\" said the Emperor, covering his face with his hands.\n\"Relax. I'll stay calm for a few months,\" I answered with a controlled smile.\n\"Until you do what?\" asked Franz, glancing at me sideways as he moved next to his father.\n\"Head south. Help the dawi reclaim Karak Eight Peaks. I think it will be the bloodiest battle I've ever been in. They say the goblins number in the hundreds of thousands. There's also some kind of beastman concentration in the region that could reach into the millions. I think it will be my next great military victory,\" I said, enjoying the way the Emperor clenched his jaw and Franz bit his lip at my plans.\n\"You should be preparing for the coming Storm of Chaos, not going out looking for fights everywhere,\" said the Emperor.\n\"Well… father. One Chaos champion dead in Kislev, from what one can say. That managed to reduce the future problem a little,\" said Karl, eyeing the Emperor's hammer.\n\"What Franzi said,\" I replied with a smirk.\n\"Tsh…,\" Karl muttered, rubbing the bridge of his nose.\n\"On that note: how does the hammer behave now that it has finally returned to the Empire?\" I asked, looking at the Emperor, who still seemed very nervous.\n\"Oh… yes. The hammer. A phenomenal weapon. The most powerful weapon in the Empire. Without a doubt you can see the runes that make it light and stronger,\" said the Emperor, puffing out his chest.\n\"The hammer doesn't have runes that make it light. Only runes that increase its power. When I held it, it weighed the same as any normal warhammer. Its power was immeasurable. It crushes armor and bone. It makes bodies explode,\" I said, raising an eyebrow and glancing sideways.\n\"Well… I think you're mistaken,\" said the Emperor.\n\"father cant lift it. When someone tries, the hammer weighs a ton. So it sits there, on its pedestal. For now we only know of three people who can take the hammer: you, the Grand Theogonist, and me,\" Franz said, lifting the hammer from the pedestal. \"Everyone else who has tried has failed.\"\n\"Curious, from what I see. Well, first things first: how goes the construction of that central bank I requested earlier?\" I asked the father-and-son duo.\n\"In Altdorf it's almost finished. The Dawi of your allied clan are working quickly to replicate the one you built in Reinsfeld, so it shouldn't take more than a month before they begin minting coins for the Empire. The only thing missing is a high-quality source of gold to serve as the standard for the imperial gold coin. Reikland relies heavily on mining from certain mountain villages and on ore purchased from the Dawi. Although one can always try to obtain it from Ostland, which has a steady gold mine. The Monfort mines are another option; they are operational, but lack the capacity to extract large quantities,\" Karl said after his father glanced at him.\n\"Good… glad to hear that. With that I'll recover part of what I invested in all this Kislev business that cost me your father. Speaking of things that benefit me: I need permission to create a new college of magic in my territories,\" I said, looking at the Emperor.\n\"And why is that? I don't think it's necessary to open a new school of magic in the Empire at the moment. According to the Patriarch's latest information, last year was poor for finding wizards. Moreover: there should be spots available for you. Now that you must train your magic, there will be masters willing to teach you,\" the Emperor said.\n\"Yes. The point is that I need the magic license to move about the Empire with peace of mind. I know perfectly well that the Cult of Sigmar will not trouble me, because my magical gift comes from Sigmar himself. The problem is the wizards. I went to speak with the Patriarch of the Colleges of Magic and he was completely opposed to granting me the license unless I submit to years of training. Moreover, they demand that I cede my lands to someone else, so I can set aside my state duties and devote myself entirely to the study of magic,\" I replied calmly.\n\"Well… usually that is the system for all who aspire to be wizards. Those who own lands cede their post to the next in the line of succession; that way it is ensured that wizards remain outside the imperial government system and are prevented from amassing too much influence. That was ordered by the Cult of Sigmar when Magnus the Pious created the colleges, as a way to limit their power. Although in this case it is problematic, isn't it, father?\" Karl said, placing a hand on his chin.\n\"Completely. There is no one to whom you can cede your territories, so the responsibility falls directly on me. Many will try to meddle and our plan would be ruined. It's not something we can allow. But I believe the High Patriarch does not act out of malice or stupidity; he is merely upholding the stipulated rules. That said, clearly they should bend them a little for the good of the Empire. That margin of flexibility is understandable. In any case, we will allow you to keep your lands while you study. I don't think the Grand Theogonist will complain. On the contrary: he would hardly want to lose such support from you,\" said the Emperor, tapping the table with his finger.\n\"Because of the Kesselheim case, above all, isn't it?\" asked Karl, setting the hammer back on its pedestal.\n\"Yes. That above all. When it was proven that the wizards had no way of locating other mages hiding in Altdorf, the Colleges were exposed before the Cult of Sigmar. That is why they've become stricter with training. They don't want another case like that to happen again. No one knows when another hidden mage could appear within the city and cause chaos because he wasn't detected in time,\" said the Emperor.\n\"I see. If the Patriarch was determined not to accept, it must have been because of that? Honestly, I don't know. But I need those licenses for Katarin's sorceresses and for Katarin herself. We'll be in the Westerlands for several months, and I don't want to have to explain to the Colleges' witch hunters what's going on. The Cult of Sigmar will probably leave me alone, but something could happen while I'm away, and that would cause problems that could be avoided with a single paper. That's why it would be far easier for me to create my own Colleges of Magic in Reinsfeld or Marienburg,\" I said, folding my arms.\n\"Yes. I understand that… but knowing you… are you sure you didn't threaten him with death?\" said Karl, staring at me intently.\n\"Something like that,\" I replied with a smile.\n\"Something like that?\" said the Emperor, slowly turning his head to look me in the eyes.\n\"I had planned to speak with the Grand Theogonist after this, about how the Patriarch thinks the Cult lies about my divine gift and that they're simply hiding the truth. Since he'll know that, armies of Templars could end up paying the Patriarch a visit,\" I said with a faint smile.\n\"Thyrus opened his mouth far too much, don't you think, father?\" said Franz, visibly concerned.\n\"Far too much. The Grand Theogonist isn't going to ask us to exile him if this is spreading publicly,\" said the Emperor.\n\"He's one of the best battle mages. We can't afford to lose him now, not when enemies will soon be at our gates…\" said Karl, looking seriously at his father.\n\"I know. We must send members of the Reikguard to see how widespread this information is. If too many people already know, there's nothing we can do,\" said the Emperor, growing nervous again.\n\"Albrecht, we'll take care of speaking with the Supreme Patriarch. I think he'll be very glad to know you saved his life for speaking too freely when he shouldn't have. It's likely we'll get you that license soon. For the moment, don't speak with the Grand Theogonist, since he mustn't know this or we'll lose a very powerful wizard just to keep the Cult of Sigmar appeased,\" said Karl, taking the initiative.\n\"If you do that, we'll get you the licenses. There's no need for a new College. Though, if you still want to make one, you're free to do so,\" said the Emperor, thoughtful.\n\"Good. I'll give it a few days and see what happens. If I hear nothing new about the Patriarch, I'll see to it that the new College becomes reality. I was thinking of trying to poach professors from the Colleges, but for now it's best to wait and see the best format to follow,\" I said, standing from my chair and watching the father and son begin to work.\nSo I left them to it. They would handle this matter. It might even mean that the Supreme Patriarch would have to beg forgiveness on his knees before the Grand Theogonist to avoid the proscription of wizards in Altdorf once more, all because of that slip of the tongue. The problem was that we were on the verge of losing the most powerful battle mage of the Empire. For some reason he held the title of Supreme Patriarch; he wouldn't be there if he weren't the best the Empire had.\nI didn't take long to return to my mansion and set about cleaning. It was thick with dust since the last time we'd left it. With the help of many of my men we began sweeping and clearing away all the filth we found.\nWe made the mansion habitable again after months of abandonment. We even found spiders the size of a head—though compared to goblin spiders, these were small creatures. They posed no danger to those who had faced the monstrous spiders bred by goblins.\nKatarin had no trouble freezing the chamber as she always did. Ice witches do not feel the cold: they could literally be naked and not sense the slightest discomfort. Even so, they prefer to wear heavy animal furs to shield themselves from the elements and appear more normal in the eyes of the Kislevite people.\nWhen the princess was already eating her second pig of the day, a messenger of the Reikguard arrived and handed me an envelope stuffed with papers. Opening it, I found several mage licenses signed by the Supreme Patriarch and by the patriarchs of the Empire's orders of magic. They were authorizations for the use of magic, ready to have the names written in—the spaces were blank.\n\"That was quick,\" I said, walking into the mansion with the licenses in hand.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The seats were narrow, uncomfortable, built more to cram in as many soldiers as possible than to give us any kind of rest.\nI turned toward the empty seat beside me. \"Looks like Lukas didn't make it…\" I thought, letting out a sigh. I was so exhausted I could barely keep my head up. We had just come from forced marches to reach the station in Kislev and catch the train back to Altdorf. After nearly a year of campaigning—maybe more, I'd already lost count—all that was left was the march home. March, fight, march again… that had been the rhythm the whole time.\nI was already nodding off, about to fall asleep, when the doors of the carriage burst open. Lukas stormed in, running with all his gear hanging off him.\n\"Shit, shit, shit… I almost missed it, and I wasn't about to wait for another train,\" he panted, dumping his backpack and musket in the luggage rack before trying to arrange everything as quickly as possible.\n\"I thought you wouldn't make it,\" I told him, half-asleep.\n\"Never let me touch kvas again, you hear me? I've been shitting myself for two days since I drank that sour milk… Blessed Sigmar, have mercy on me, don't let me fail on this trip. I don't want to suffer the worst shame of my life with stained trousers,\" he prayed with a devotion I had never seen in him.\n\"The kvas wasn't that bad… tolerable if you were thirsty enough,\" I answered, remembering the taste of that drink that hadn't sat too well with me either.\n\"Speak for yourself… it tore my guts apart,\" Lukas replied, collapsing into the seat next to me, clutching his stomach as if his life depended on it.\n\"Ha, ha… that's because you drank like a madman. It wasn't just one horn of kvas, it was several, while you threw your coins around like leaves in the wind,\" I said with a faint grin.\n\"Two days of rest are a treasure here. If we're finally going back to Altdorf, at least I want to take with me a good memory of being in a foreign land,\" Lukas finally said, settling in at my side.\n\"Yeah, it's going to be a nice memory… because I'm going to make sure to remind you of it often,\" I said with a smile.\n\"Bastard,\" Lukas muttered, yawning. His yawn got me at once.\nIt didn't take long before, crammed into those seats, the train lurched forward. The rattling of the tracks marked our return to the Empire after who knew how long away. Lukas looked pale; his stomach wasn't giving him any peace, but before long he drifted off. I followed soon after.\nThe ride went by quickly, though more than once I was jolted awake by the snores echoing through the carriage, packed with soldiers just as drained as we were.\nThe last time I opened my eyes, Lukas was drooling on my shoulder. I tilted my head to shake him off and, through the window, I recognized the walls of Altdorf, the same ones I had seen countless times in my years helping my family with their errands in the city.\n\"Lukas… Lukas,\" I shook him.\n\"The trumpet hasn't sounded yet… let me sleep…\" he grumbled, trying to turn his back on me.\n\"We've arrived, idiot. We're in Altdorf.\"\n\"What…? Eh… right… shit, we're here!\" he said, rubbing his eyes while the sunlight blinded him a little.\n\"Get ready, I want to be one of the first out. I'm not staying trapped in the carriage queue,\" I told him, pushing him so he'd move.\nAt last he got up and we started gathering our things. The train skirted the walls and soon after entered the station. I hadn't slept well, but it was still a thousand times better than trying to rest in a Kislevite tent, with the cold sinking into our bones and the locals glaring at us with unfriendly faces.\nWhen the train finally stopped, we got off quickly. The station was teeming with life: merchants crowded in, offering their wares, hoping to snatch a few coins from the freshly returned soldiers.\n\"Hurry up!\" an officer shouted, calling the attention of everyone disembarking.\n\"What's going on, sergeant?\" I asked, raising my voice while saluting him.\n\"Everyone must first pass through the money-changer. The Council doesn't want Cathayan or Kislevite coins circulating in the city market uncontrolled.\" The sergeant pointed to a nearby building marked with the Imperial symbol.\nWe nodded silently and, like the rest of the men, slung our packs over our shoulders and started walking toward the building.\nIt didn't take long to arrive. We found a group of workers hauling chests while several dwarfs sat behind heavy tables, with abacuses and scales in front of them.\n\"Manling, come here!\" one of the dwarfs barked, pointing at me with one of his thick fingers.\nI stepped forward at once.\n\"What have you got? Cathayan coins? Kislevite rubles? Something from the Princes?\" he asked, opening a ledger and dipping his metal pen in ink.\n\"Ah, yes…\" I said, setting my pack down and fishing out my coin pouch. \"Here. All of these are foreign coins.\"\nThe dwarf grabbed the pouch and spilled more than two hundred coins across the table.\n\"Cathayan coins… quite a few. Eighty-four gold,\" he muttered as he counted them one by one. Then he pulled out a tool: a pair of metal tongs. He picked up a coin, flicked it with a sharp snap of his finger, and examined it with an expert eye.\n\"Pure gold,\" he confirmed, jotting it in his book before placing them on the scale. He weighed them carefully, balancing them against Imperial crowns until satisfied. \"Fifty-one Imperial crowns. That's what you had in Cathayan coin.\"\n\"Seriously? I thought it would be more…\" I said, frowning at the scales.\n\"Cathayan coins weigh less than Imperial crowns. It's normal. Now let's see the Bretonnian and the rubles.\"\nHe repeated the process with each pile, until one rang hollow.\n\"This one doesn't sound right…\" the dwarf growled. He took a heavy pair of shears, clipped the edge of the coin, and nodded grimly. \"Fake. Tin-filled. A cruel trick.\" He tossed it into a container and swapped it for a silver shilling.\nHe kept at it patiently, checking each piece. At last, he handed me back a pouch with the result of the whole exchange.\n\"Good. In total: seventy golden crowns and ten silver shillings. By order of the Prince of Marienburg, leader of the Reikland Imperial Bank Council, no fee is charged for this task. Just one more question: do you reside in Altdorf?\" he said before handing me the pouch.\n\"Yes, I live in the capital of the Empire,\" I answered.\n\"Perfect. Then I must inform you—\" he continued, setting a few coins aside, \"—that, under the city's taxes, His Imperial Majesty takes ten percent of your earnings.\"\n\"What…? But… right…\" I muttered, pressing my lips together as I watched him store my coins in a chest and record them in another ledger.\n\"All done. You may go,\" the dwarf concluded, handing me the pouch back. I stashed it quickly and walked away, still with anger churning in my stomach.\nI stepped outside and saw Lukas waiting, looking sour.\n\"What happened?\" I asked.\n\"They plucked me clean,\" he answered with a frown. \"Twenty-three crowns in taxes, can you believe it? That's more than two years of what I earned hauling crates, gone in a breath.\"\n\"Wait, wait… twenty-three? That means you had…\" I did the math on my fingers.\n\"More than two hundred,\" Lukas replied, still upset.\n\"And how the hell did you get three times what I had?\" I said, completely shocked.\n\"Dah… gambling, how else?\" he said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.\n\"What?\" I blurted, incredulous.\n\"Yes… in taverns. Dice, cards… the usual,\" he answered with a frustrated look.\n\"And you wasted it like an idiot? How much did you have in total?\" I pressed.\n\"Twice as much,\" he said, wiping his nose quickly with a finger.\n\"Nooo!\" I said, staring at him.\n\"Drop it already. I don't want to talk about it anymore. We've got days off, let's make the most of them,\" Lukas said.\n\"Who said that?\" I asked, interested.\n\"The sergeant. A whole week free. After that we report five days a week at the camp while waiting for the next campaign. It'll be next year, though nobody knows in which month. So enjoy while you can.\"\n\"I see… then I'll head home and see how things are. I haven't heard a word from my family since I left the city,\" I said, adjusting my pack.\n\"Yeah, me too… though first I'm going to see if any tavern sells Bugman's beer. That kick is worth it,\" Lukas said with a grin.\n\"I don't know how you could drink that without passing out,\" I answered, shaking my head.\n\"It's called having a refined palate… for good dwarfen beer,\" Lukas shot back, before disappearing into the city crowd and leaving me alone in the square.\nI quickly adjusted my musket and started walking through the city toward my home. Nothing seemed to have changed much, except the streets looked cleaner and more orderly. There were more guards than usual—of course, the great harvest festival was near, and security always doubled around those dates.\nWhen I arrived, my house looked the same, which calmed me down: nothing serious had happened. I didn't waste time before banging on the door.\nI knocked several times until finally, someone opened it. A head peeked out.\n\"Yes?... we already paid this year's taxes, officer,\" said my mother.\n\"Come now, mother… I haven't changed so much that you can't recognize me,\" I said with a huge smile.\nShe narrowed her eyes. \"Josef?\" she asked, reaching her hands toward my face. \"Josef! My son, what joy to see you again… but what happened to you? You look so different… that beard, all dirty and unkempt!\"\n\"Enough, stop it, ha, ha… where are father and my brothers?\" I asked as I stepped inside and saw my sisters helping mother with the cooking.\n\"Working. Your father found a job with a merchant who needs men to move goods around the city. He's been there almost three months now, pays well,\" my mother answered, wiping her hands on her apron.\nI dropped my pack, set the musket aside, and put the bayonet back into its pouch.\n\"Ah… blessed Sigmar, I'm so tired,\" I sighed, collapsing into one of the chairs.\n\"The campaign, did it go well?\" one of my sisters asked, her hands covered in flour.\n\"Yes… though my feet felt like they were full of needles, from so much marching without rest. Days upon days walking, from the south of the Empire. We fought against greenskins, the terrifying waaaaagh giant-greens,\" I said while picking up my younger sister, who was clumsily slicing apples.\n\"By Shallya…!\" my mother exclaimed, worried. \"And Lukas? How is he?\"\n\"He's fine. Probably drunk already… he's grown fond of dwarfen beer. Says it makes him feel invincible the day after drinking that oil-like stuff. But our general never sent us to the front, always kept us behind. You can rest easy,\" I said, trying to reassure her.\n\"You don't know how much relief that brings me… You came back alive, and that's what matters. Now I hope you quit this life and find work with your father and brothers,\" she said, her eyes still filled with concern.\n\"What for? Look.\" I set my younger sister back down so she could keep cutting and pulled the coin pouch from my pack. \"Look what I earned while away.\"\nI placed it in her hands. She opened it and went pale.\n\"Josef… where did you steal this from?\" she asked, her voice trembling.\n\"No, mother! It's my pay… and part of my right to loot,\" I said to calm her.\n\"Ah, blessed Sigmar!\" she murmured.\n\"How much is it?\" one of my sisters asked while kneading the crust of an apple pie.\n\"About seventy gold crowns… and a pile of silver,\" I answered.\n\"That's a lot…\" said the eldest.\n\"Too much,\" added the middle one.\n\"Well, I'm still under contract. I'm still working for the general until I'm discharged from the army. By the way, mother… is my bed free? I need more sleep,\" I said, turning to her while counting the coins with trembling hands.\n\"Yes, it's always been ready for the day you returned,\" she answered.\nI went up to my room and collapsed on the bed. I don't know how long I slept, but I woke up suddenly when something heavy landed on my stomach. I opened my eyes: my coins were scattered over me and my father was standing there with a smile.\n\"Come eat. Your brothers want to hear more of your stories,\" he said cheerfully.\n\"Yeah, sure,\" I replied, getting up with a yawn.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

For days on end, trains did not cease arriving, bringing back thousands of soldiers who, not long ago, had been but simple citizens of Altdorf. Now they returned hardened by war, seasoned in battles against beastmen, orcs, goblins, border princes, and even warbands sworn to the Ruinous Powers. Many may have known little more than how to wield a musket, yet none could deny them the merit of having survived such trials.\nThey came back not only with scars, but with their purses heavy with gold and silver. Men recruited as mere townsfolk returned as wealthy individuals. And through the currency exchange in the city, we gathered taxes most efficiently: nearly a quarter of a million golden crowns in only a matter of days, according to the reports. My father was well pleased with such figures, for the taxes of Altdorf's lower classes rarely exceeded two million crowns a year. This influx alone represented a significant increase.\nMore important still was what they did with their coin. They spent freely, sending money flowing through every corner of the capital. Merchants, enriched by this spending, in turn paid greater dues. Thus, indirectly, Altdorf prospered from Albrecht's campaign. Never before had it been so plain to see how war could feed the city's economy.\nFor the first time in decades, Altdorf's historic population declined. Tens of thousands were moved beyond the walls to till the new lands cleared after the campaign in the forests of Reikland. My father acted swiftly, and in short order villages arose where once only beastmen had dwelt. Where those corrupted creatures once hid and bred in the thickets, there now spread fertile fields. Thousands of Reiklanders ploughed the soil, raising farmsteads, increasing food production, and lessening Altdorf's dependence upon Averland and Wissenland, which had long supplied the capital with grain.\nThe only trouble came from the avarice of the Prince of Marienburg's merchants. They bought up all the grain they could find in the Empire's markets, creating scarcity and driving prices skyward. Provinces such as Nordland, Ostland, and Hochland, reliant on trade for their sustenance, suffered greatly. We were forced to intervene at once, securing ties with Tilea, Bretonnia, and Estalia to provide grain at the lowest cost possible. Even so, prices remained high, and tensions rose, especially among the local nobility.\nFortunately, the recent harvest in the reclaimed lands helped steady the local market somewhat. Encouraging news also came from Ostermark: record yields, thanks to the agricultural system Albrecht had set in place there. Confiscated lands had been distributed among the peasants, and under better management they now bore plentiful fruit.\nOf course, not all was prosperity. The Elector Count of Talabecland was already demanding the return of his lands, for in his judgment there was no longer any threat of Kislevite incursions. After all, the Empire now had Boris Bokha as a firm ally, strengthened further with his daughter held in Altdorf as a political hostage. He doubted Ostermark would face attack, and this complicated matters: an Imperial army was stationed there, supported by Ostermark's taxes, and the very notion of maintaining it longer risked stirring conflict with Talabecland. Quarrels were inevitable, especially now that Ostermark had the means to resist the Elector's claims.\n\"A good year, by the look of it,\" I remarked to my father, who leafed through a thick ledger. He could scarce hide his smile as he studied the reports of the revenue.\n\"I cannot complain,\" he answered with satisfaction. \"The merchants arriving in Altdorf have nearly tripled their taxes thanks to the new railways. Do you know how many traders use Albrecht's train line to Kislev? Thousands. They stop in Talabheim, in Bechafen, even in Kislev itself, but all pass through Altdorf. They buy, they sell, they leave their coffers open, and we take our share. With this income, I can fund a serious expansion of the Imperial fleet and strengthen our defenses against the Norscans. Moreover, I shall increase orders of armor from our forges and acquire more of those firearms Albrecht produces.\"\n\"I see… any further word of the harvests in the provinces? Any sign of famine? We must be prepared to send aid. It is always wise to have granaries ready: we win allies among the local nobility if we place grain in their hands at the right moment,\" I said, watching him closely.\n\"For now, nothing alarming,\" he replied, scanning his papers. \"There is speculation that the Westerlands will enjoy extraordinary harvests. Albrecht has poured vast sums into transforming those marshes into farmland: canals, dams, reservoirs, and dozens of new towns to house the hundreds of thousands of Bretonnians he brought back from his last campaign. And the temples, of course… The cult of Shallya opened some forty in just the past year, and that of Sigmar more than a hundred. If they are expanding with such fervor, it is a sure sign the region prospers.\"\n\"So I see. With luck, this scarcity shall not come again. It would be disastrous to face a hunger crisis just as the Ruinous Powers chose to descend upon us,\" I observed, pacing slowly through the hall, watching him sidelong.\n\"Indeed…\" my father sighed, closing the ledger. \"By the way, the new bank is complete. A special runic press was needed to mint hundreds of coins at once. I require you to go and see its operation. You know well that many Electors resent losing the right to control their own coinage. I must be certain this bank can uphold the Empire with a stable issue, without delays in the payments owed to all.\"\n\"Yes… it was no easy task convincing so many Electors to accept such a measure. Thus, at the very least, the stipulated yearly payments must be met. Only then shall we succeed in bringing the whole Empire to use a single coinage. And one can already see that Albrecht knows well how to choose those he serves,\" I said with a smile.\n\"You cannot go wrong with the dawi, my son. Yet we ourselves have not forged with them such a level of alliance. Aye, we can request runic arms, but I doubt they would ever agree to labor under our command were we to demand it,\" my father replied.\n\"Albrecht may be a dreadful diplomat in many fields… but with the dawi he seems better than most,\" I muttered under my breath, suppressing a laugh.\n\"Yes… well, let us hope I do not one day awake to death threats of his making. We both know how impulsive he can be when he seeks quarrel. I only hope he has no reason to march south too soon,\" my father said, letting slip a shadow of unease. \"Though we must discuss that new territory he has conquered. For now, it lies empty, yet if he continues to expand there, it shall prove troublesome.\"\n\"We might move first,\" I suggested, fixing him with a steady look. \"Organise the campaign and justify the creation of a new Elector in that region. The dilemma, of course, is whom to appoint. We cannot keep granting offices to the Margrave's house—it would become far too obvious.\"\n\"Quite so,\" my father agreed after a pause. \"But that we shall settle later. For now, go to the bank and see that all is in order. I shall attend to the matter of the Cult of Sigmar: a new templar order is to guard the Black Fire Pass, and it will require funding, as well as recruits for its fortress.\"\nI said little more, moving out accompanied by a strong detachment of the Reiksguard. We did not travel far from the Imperial Palace: the new building rose upon a plot that had once belonged to a Tilean cook named Mezzo, owner of a restaurant frequented by lawyers and even the odd wizard. With a measure of Imperial pressure—and a generous sum of gold—the sale had been forced. The old business was demolished along with several surrounding structures, and in its place now stood what looked more like a dwarfen fortress raised upon the surface.\nAll had been built in the solid style of the dawi. The walls bore runic inscriptions that gleamed faintly beneath the sun, proof that the place was more than secure.\n\"Prince Karl Franz?\" asked one of the guards at the gate. He wore full armor of rune-wrought dwarfen steel.\n\"Indeed,\" I answered, halting before him.\n\"We had been expecting the Imperial family,\" he said respectfully, turning to the massive doors. They did not swing open in full; instead, a smaller access was revealed, through which we were led.\nWithin, light did not come from without but from glowing stones that cast a soft radiance across every corner. Behind barred windows set with crystal panes, I glimpsed workers cleaning and preparing the halls; there were small slots cut for speaking between compartments.\n\"This way, Prince. I understand you wish to see the coinage in progress. The process has already begun,\" said the guard as he guided me into the depths of the bank.\nWe descended by stair to a lower level. The ring of hammers echoed faintly ahead. At each step, the corridors revealed scores of dawi attending to security checks: they touched runes carved into the walls, which flared briefly at their touch. There were vaults both vast and small, prepared to hold Imperial treasures as well as private deposits.\nAt last we reached the source of the sound. The metallic thunder of a monumental press striking iron filled the air. Crossing the threshold, I saw dozens of dwarfs laboring around the machine. The press lifted again, revealing a set of freshly minted coins. They shone with the marks of the Imperial crown: on one face, the clear likeness of my father; on the other, the shields of all the Electors. There was no doubt—those dies were the work of master dawi, for even at a glance I could recognize the faithful rendering of my father's visage and the minute detail of every Elector's blazon.\n\"As you can see, all is in order. For Reikland, three million crowns must be struck, as the Emperor commanded,\" explained the guard, summoning one of the dwarfen masters.\nA thick-bearded dwarf pulled a lever. The press fell with a thunderous crash upon the gold blanks, then rose again to reveal new coins, each perfectly struck. Others hastened to remove them, setting in place fresh discs of pure gold for the next blow.\n\"Master dwarf,\" the guard called.\n\"What is it, umgi?\" the dwarf replied, scratching his beard with patient air.\n\"The Imperial Prince,\" the guard clarified, pointing toward me with due respect.\n\"Ah, of course…\" the dwarf said, bowing his head just slightly, while his companions continued their unbroken toil. \"Tell me, umgi, what concerns the Emperor?\"\n\"I see you handle great stores of gold. From whence is it drawn? Of good quality, I presume?\" I asked, studying the master dwarf.\n\"Gold of the Grey Mountains,\" he answered firmly. \"Within our Thane's hold were found several veins, of the highest grade. It is refined under the strictest dawi standards to ensure that the dawongi of our Thane Duran delivers only the best to the Empire. Each coin weighs precisely two and a half grams, as the dawongi himself decreed. The weight is measured with a flawless balance system, impossible to tamper with, and the runic press you see here strikes every piece to perfection, with marks crafted to reveal any attempt at filing.\"\nHe paused as another blow of the press sent a metallic roar through the chamber.\"According to our calculations, we can produce two million crowns each week, working in continuous shifts.\"\n\"That is far beyond what we requested,\" I replied, astonished at the figure.\n\"Therefore, the surplus shall be stored in the bank's vaults,\" explained the master dwarf calmly. \"Only the necessary amount will be released each year. One never knows when a vein may run dry. We are exploiting this one to the fullest, and it would not surprise me if it is exhausted before long. Better to produce now, in abundance, than trust to fortune later.\" The dwarf scratched his beard, pride gleaming in his eyes.\n\"I see… and what of the silver and copper coinage?\" I asked, since it seemed the gold was well assured.\n\"In the lower levels,\" said the dawi, pointing downward with his finger.\nThe guards led me to inspect the place, and I noted how many sublevels it held… so many that it seemed as though an entire dwarfen fortress had been raised beneath the city.\nWe descended some five levels to reach the minting of silver, and three more for the copper. Each floor was the same: circular ingots of ore, mined from the Grey Mountains, refined by the dawi and pressed with rune-forged machinery that struck every coin flawlessly.\nQuickly the vaults began to fill with currency bearing my father's visage and the blazons of all the Imperial Electors upon the reverse.\n\"One may say many things of Albrecht… but that he neglects his duty? Never,\" I murmured to myself, climbing back toward the surface, ready to report all this to my father.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

All eyes were fixed on the same group of men: the priests of Morr.\nI have never understood why the Imperials venerate that god so much. Not death itself, but their idea of what comes after. They live with death every day, and yet they fear it so deeply. Perhaps that is why the cult of Morr has spread across the Empire almost as widely as Sigmar's; perhaps even more so, if every lost village in these lands were counted. And unlike the Sigmarites, these priests do not seek to impose their will upon the Empire, which makes them seem stranger still.\nIt was plain to me that Albrecht held genuine respect for Morr. One only had to look at what he had ordered to be built: a great temple, raised on the mountainside, with broad tracts of rocky land granted to serve as its cemetery. The Dawi helped him dig galleries into the stone, and the result is a graveyard that burrows into the mountain itself. Still under construction, yet already it looms like a monstrous edifice of rock, lifted in honor of that dark and silent god.\nMany believe Albrecht is all aggression and recklessness. But here… I saw something else. Beneath his confidence and his fierceness, I glimpsed a man truly weighed down by the lives of his soldiers. His eyes betrayed him; in them guilt screamed as the coffins were lowered into the earth. I knew that look. It was the same I had seen in nobles after a battle.\nWith time, that burden fades, replaced by habit. But Albrecht has been fighting for years, watching men die under his command. That he still bears that spark of pain is strange indeed.\n\"May ravens alight upon you,\" he finally said, when the priests had finished chanting their prayers and the dead were laid to rest.\nBefore we departed, I saw his jaw tighten as he looked upon the families mourning their fallen. For a moment it seemed he might step closer, perhaps speak to them, but he restrained himself. We left in silence.\n\"And now what?\" I asked, letting my irony show. \"What will we do now that we have finished praising the god of death?\"\n\"He is not the god of death,\" he answered gravely. \"He is Morr, god of the dead. His blessing shields against necromancy and demons any who ask it. The only thing I can do for them is ensure a swift passage to his garden, so their souls do not fall into the hands of necromancers or the servants of Chaos.\"\nWe walked in silence toward Albrecht's griffon, waiting amid his men. They guarded it as though it were a living treasure. We mounted quickly, and with a thunderous beat of wings, it carried us aloft. The icy air lashed my face as I clung to Albrecht's blue garments, watching his soldiers march in formation far below, with my own witches not far behind.\n\"Where are we going?\" I shouted over the roar of the wind.\n\"To my laboratory. I need to see if the old man is still breathing,\" he replied, his tone dry and edged with irony.\nWe flew over his lands. It was impossible not to notice the vastness of the harvests: endless fields of golden wheat stretching to the horizon, cut through by lines of trees and broad irrigation canals that gleamed in the sun. The order was far too deliberate to be chance; it was the mark of a man who thought on a grand scale.\nIn time I saw a village at the foot of the mountain. There a colossal mining operation unfolded. Thousands of laborers tore into the stone\nThe path to the gate was paved with flagstones etched with Dawi runes. Yet these markings lacked the strength of true runic craft. They were carved symbols of reverence, not vessels of power.\nNearly a dozen Dawi awaited us before the doors. Their bodies were encased in runic armor that made them seem like statues of stone. Only their eyes gleamed beneath the helms, and their beards jutted from the slits\nWhen they recognized us, their stillness broke into jubilant cries. Some ran inside the fortress, doubtless to give word, while others came to Albrecht with open arms.\n\"Ah, dawongi, it has been too long!\" one of the Dawi exclaimed, gripping his hand firmly. At once the rest joined in the greeting, laughing and chattering in their rough tongue.\n\"That umgi… may she pass?\" one of them asked, bristling.\n\"She comes with me. My betrothed,\" Albrecht said with a smile to those Dawi whose hands hovered near their rune-hammers.\n\"Oh… then I hold no grudge against you,\" the Dawi replied in a more amicable tone.\n\"Tell me, is Hieronymus here?\" Albrecht asked another.\nOne of the Dawi let out a hearty laugh as we drew near. \"Aye… the umgi has been working and resting, trying some of your experiments from the books. Sometimes he goes out to drink with the Dawi, but he collapses by the tenth tankard… like a whelp,\" he said with mirth.\n\"Good to hear,\" Albrecht answered, and stepped into the fortress.\nInside, the place teemed with Dawi: hundreds of rune-warriors at the gates, guards on the battlements, workshops in the tunnels. Merchants and craftsmen bustled beneath the mountain,There was a huge statue in these tunnels that led to the top of the view, where a human and a dwarf were shaking hands, even though they were the same size, and Albrecht laughed when he saw it.. Few gave us more than a salute as Albrecht passed. When he touched the stone, a hidden passage opened before him.\n\"Come, do not lag behind,\" he said, and I followed him down.\nThe Dawi-stones gleamed. When another door swung open, the first thing we saw were empty jars strewn across the floor. \"Ah… how he soils my laboratory, that scoundrel,\" Albrecht grunted, pulling back a golden sheet that covered someone.\n\"Eh… ah… are you still alive…?\" an old voice rasped as the man, with effort, reached for things on a table. One arm and one leg were of bronze; he moved with difficulty.\n\"Do you think I'll die that easily? Look what I managed.\" Albrecht brandished one of the magical licences they had given him and waved it like a trophy.\nThe old man stared at it, astonished. \"What is… how? How did you get all the patriarchs of the Colleges to sign this?\"\n\"One has his tricks. Besides… look how pretty it looks with my name — and we could put yours on it too,\" Albrecht said, smiling broadly.\nThe elder sighed. \"I must get out more… I think I know nothing of what happens outside.\"\nI asked straight away: \"Is he a wizard?\"\n\"Yes. An Ice-witch,\" the old man answered. \"My question is what someone who uses the ice-magic, the spirit-magic of Kislev, is doing in the Empire,\" he added in a rough voice.\n\"My betrothed… long story,\" Albrecht replied without pausing. He looked at the mage and asked if he had achieved anything while he was away.\n\"A Kislevite Ice-witch… poor choice. They are cold, calculating, and unscrupulous. In my youth I had run-ins with them: some companions from the Golden College and I went to Erengrad in search of materials for enchantments and we encountered witches who had killed an entire family because the man displayed magical ability… when we were in the area\" the Golden Magus said.\nI kept my silence; it was common enough for my sisters to act like that because of the prophecy they so feared\n\"Enough of that. Tell me what you've done so far,\" Albrecht said.\nThe old man smiled with awkward pride and produced a glass phial marked with Dawi runes.\n\"With much trial and error I managed to reproduce your nitroglycerin,\" he said. \"I combined it with nitrocellulose… Ta-dah… cordite.\" He tossed the vial into the air like a prize.\n\"Careful, you fool, that's still unstable; runes or no runes, don't do anything stupid,\" Albrecht warned, rummaging for something among his clothes.\n\"Look what I did while I was travelling,\" Albrecht said, showing one of his bronze cartridges. He began to fill it with fine filaments from the vial, seated a bullet to close it, and struck it with the haft of his dagger, producing a loud explosion.\n\"Oh… a mercury primer then, similar to your rotary cannon, I see,\" the magus murmured, and Albrecht used his magic to sweep the residue from the air.\n\"Good. We are on the right path. We have what we need to replace the gunpowder we produce with something more stable and powerful; nitrocellulose is rather unstable, but now we'll have something safer. Although every musket will need adapting to fire this kind of ammunition. I have my Dawi engineer working on a simpler weapon prototype, but he hasn't delivered the plans yet; he is making something more controllable. Some of his creations concentrate so much power that the blast cracks the metal. He considered using Dawi runes, but you understand that cannot be applied en masse,\" Albrecht told the magus.\n\"Yes, I imagine so. And speaking of weapons, I've been supervising the factory. The machines and workers haven't stopped: last month they managed to produce about ten thousand units,\" the magus said.\n\"Ten thousand… Kislev needs more arms. How much of that production could be sold to Kislev?\" I asked, intrigued.\n\"It's for my armies and orders — I cannot keep bleeding myself so Kislev gets everything for free. I must make coin, I have little left, so no more asking for things for nothing,\" Albrecht replied.\n\"Is she a Kislev noble?\" the Golden Magus asked.\n\"'Princess and heir apparent Katarin Bokha,'\" Albrecht answered while continuing to inspect the magus's contraption and weaving magic around the filaments.\n\"I have been locked away too long… do you think I can go out now or must I keep hiding?\" the Golden Magus asked.\n\"It is safe now. In fact, you could present yourself at the Golden College and reclaim your post now that you can say you helped a elector count with a problem in his factories. You have my full backing. You could also see a mage of Ghyran or a priest of Shallya to examine that arm and leg; they might assist you,\" Albrecht said.\n\"Bah… I will keep this as a reminder of my folly. I knew mages who could help me in Marienburg… well, I say 'knew,' because I think they are dead,\" the Golden Magus answered.\n\"Good. Look: I brought the Ice Generator. A capable Ice-witch and her band of witches will come soon to help with the low temperatures required for mass nitroglycerin production. To prevent more violent reactions, we must coordinate with the Dawi who work in the lab; they are usually reserved about their craft,and the 'elgi' magic \" Albrecht said.\n\"Ice Generator,\" I repeated, narrowing my eyes.\n\"It's the truth. If you want weapons for Kislev you are going to have to work, Katarin. Arms are not cheap, especially now that I must figure how to produce so many to change the Empire's equipment. Speaking of which, how many armours will they have ready for me?\" Albrecht asked, scratching his head and leaving the laboratory.\nI followed. He walked through tunnels to a storehouse where many Dawi smiths greeted him warmly. Suddenly more Dawi began to arrive, carrying large crates filled with runic armour.\nOthers brought hammers, axes and maces, all etched with Dawi runes.\nThey even brought what looked like barding for horses, also runic.\nMy left eye began to twitch slightly. I knew exactly how much that was worth. Each piece could fetch between three and five thousand roubles if you found a Dawi willing to sell. And here they were, delivering them in droves.\nBut there were hundreds — perhaps thousands — of those armours stacked everywhere; they kept coming without end. I knew he already kept a contingent of his personal guard clad in runic plate, yet it seemed he could now outfit several hundred more men with Dawi runic weapons, besides the many standards they carried bearing his rune-marked emblem…\nIf he's supposedly short of gold, where the devil is he finding the coin to pay for all of this?\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I stepped in quickly and, letting go with my left hand, threw a punch with everything I had. The blow landed square on his cheek and his head snapped back with a crack.\nMy rival staggered backwards and, before he could fall, kicked my knee—made me grit my teeth. We stood there, face to face, breathing hard, both looking for the smallest fault in the other's stance to exploit.\nWe kept changing guards, adjusting feet and shoulders. Every move was a test. At last I advanced and, with a long stride, lunged a quick thrust at his face to catch him off guard. He turned his wrist with a nimble twist and parried, but in doing so left his flank exposed. I slipped into the gap and threw myself at him, seizing his waist and driving him down into the earth.\nWe rolled for a few seconds on the ground, each of us wrestling for control. Dust rose around us; hands clawed at cloth; brute strength was everything in that moment.\n\"All right… that's enough for today. Very good bout,\" said the witch-hunter captain of Reinsfeld, who had been watching the fights in the personal defense class at the school.\nI got up quickly and held out my hand to my companion. He took it, and with a tug got back to his feet.\n\"Good fight, Georg,\" Bertram said as he brushed the dust from his face and clothes.\n\"Yeah, not bad. I forget sometimes you're deadly on your back,\" I replied, picking my wooden sword from the ground.\nI had been attending this school for years. By a law set by our lord we were required to go every day—except for two days a week—where we learned things normally out of reach for families like mine, who had migrated here from Talabecland.\nI'd been lucky enough to hear the imperial herald announce the offer from the barony of the Reinsfelds, before the changes of title, and so I'd been able to get a proper education. They taught us to read and write, arithmetic, the history of the Empire, the sacred texts of Sigmar, personal defense, and the healing arts of the Cult of Shallya: what they considered essential for any servant of the Empire, and therefore of Sigmar, to fulfill his duty.\nMy parents did not like it. Followers of Taal and Rhya, they hated the idea that I would serve Sigmar. Above all because the relationship between the cult of Taal and the Elector Count of the Westerlands was poisoned. His policies against the beastmen were to burn vast stretches of forest, which outraged Taal's priests. More and more regions of the Empire copied those tactics: villages fortified, whole groves razed, and stone fortresses raised where sacred clearings had stood.\nI saw it differently. I could understand my parents' anger, but I also knew we were cutting out the worst enemy that lived within our lands. To them it was scandalous: Reinsfeld had never been very respectful of the other imperial cults. It was known that three of them received generous donations from the Elector Count: Sigmar, with dozens of schools founded in every new town; Shallya, with temple-hospitals opening in each settlement; and Morr, to whom the count showed particular devotion—he even ordered the construction of a cathedral whose scale exceeded any other in the Empire.\nBy contrast, Taal and Rhya were relegated to secondary cults. They barely had chapels—scattered shrines raised by the faithful in the few woods that remained in Reinsfeld's territories before large-scale logging swept them away to eradicate the beastmen.\nI remember well what happened once with my father. He was caught in the middle of a Taal ritual in the forest when witch-hunters mistook him for a cultist. They seized him and questioned him, and it was not gentle. He came home battered, eyes hardened, and from then on he muttered that in these lands Taal's worship was a condemnation.\nStill, through it all I was grateful for what I had received. The education I accessed was, they said, the same a merchant's son would get. We learned to keep accounts, to tend wounds, to read and write fluently. We could hope to work as clerks, healers, scribes… or, as many whispered, to enlist in the Elector Count's army. Rumor had it he'd raised soldiers' wages to three shillings a day because he thought it unfair they risked their lives for the same coin paid to the workers in his workshops. At least, that was the gossip in classrooms and taverns.\nI was about to gather my things. As much as I enjoyed being there, I'd reached the age the law allowed; I had to return home, help my family, likely marry, and find work soon.\n\"Georg,\" said the witch-hunter captain in that deep voice he always used. \"I need you to stay… I know you're no longer obliged, but we must perform the final exam. Being among the best, I think you deserve a harder exam that will determine your future.\" The hunter spoke plainly, without flourish.\nI nodded. I had no idea what it would be, but it felt serious: several of my classmates—the ones we all knew as the toughest fighters—were being assembled and taken to the temple of Sigmar in Reinsfeld.\nThe Reinsfeld lector, an old man who had not lost his severity, led us. He still wore war-plate and bore his consecrated hammer like a relic; with a silver key he opened the way to the deeper galleries of the temple.\nIn the adjacent cells witch-hunters questioned and tortured mutants and heretics; agonized screams leaked through half-open doors while templars recorded every word. They led us to an empty reading room: chests full of amulets of purity and chains of blessed silver leaned against the walls, reflecting torchlight.\n\"Let the prayers begin, brothers,\" said the lector of Reinsfeld, and several warrior-priests started their low entreaties. A golden energy of Sigmar seemed to wash the room as the priests sought protection and lit more candles.\nThe lector opened one of the boxes, carefully lifted chains, and drew out a heavy book which he handed to the witch-hunter captain.\n\"You, who have shown fortitude, devotion and—above all—mental resilience to Sigmar, are among the few we can trust with the secret of our enemy… an enemy that has always been present and will remain so until we root it out wherever it hides,\" said the captain, placing the book on a lectern and beginning to turn its pages with steady hands.\nI felt the temperature drop as the volume opened; the air grew colder and a shadow seemed to fall over us as the first pages crackled.\n\"To defeat the true foe… not Bretonnia, nor Kislev, nor orcs or goblins… the Lords of Chaos… you must know them. At least, know how they lure victims to gain their devotion,\" said the witch-hunter captain of Reinsfeld, turning the book to show symbols drawn in dark ink. \"I will say it but once. Their name draws the glance of the Lords of Chaos… this is Khorne.\"\nHe showed the emblem and, when I saw it, I felt a terrible pressure in my chest. The air grew heavier, as if breathing cost effort. My companions sweated and panted with difficulty, as though an invisible force pressed them to the ground.\n\"This Lord of Chaos draws his followers with promises of power, blessings unthinkable at the cost of their sanity. They only know war and blood. They're the easiest to detect… they cannot hide, they need to kill to offer devotion to their dark lord,\" explained the captain as he turned the page.\n\"Slaanesh… this one is among the hardest to uncover,\" he continued. \"His followers live in excess: food, passion, art, pride. He's dangerous because he hides among the high circles, among nobles and their private gatherings.\" When he spoke those words he looked at all of us with severity, scanning our faces for signs of weakness. I felt my chest ache more and my breath coming shorter and more ragged.\n\"Nurgle… lord of diseases,\" he went on. \"Every outbreak, every plague is tied to him. Whenever there's a pestilence, you must be on guard and call the nearest priest of Shallya. His followers appear sporadically, but when they do, thousands die under their corrupt gifts.\" The captain turned the page one last time.\n\"Tzeentch… knowledge, betrayal, subterfuge,\" he said in a hard voice. \"The worst of them, because he can be anywhere in society. He hides in nobles and peasants alike. He often offers a false freedom from imperial yoke… and with that he poisons everything he touches.\"\nThe captain slammed the book shut. The sound rang through the room like a hammer strike, and the cold that had pressed on us dissipated at once. The volume was hurriedly put back in the chest and the silver chains were replaced on top of it, as if trying to imprison the darkness within its pages.\n\"Now you know the truth… you are all invited to join the Order of the Silver Hammer for training as witch-hunters. You are fit candidates for recruitment… or you may leave now. Knowing the truth already makes you stronger against the Dark Lords,\" finished the witch-hunter captain, his voice booming beneath the stone vaults.\nThe tension in the air was so thick it was almost tangible; the echo of his words left a lump in my throat. Some of my companions swallowed; others avoided looking at one another.\n\"The Order of the Silver Hammer defends the Empire from internal enemies, seeking corruption wherever it hides,\" added the Reinsfeld lector. \"Although… you may also join the Elector Count's forces, who fight directly against the servants of the Dark Lords. You will be welcomed either way. You are the bulwarks against Chaos, the pillars of this society. Wherever you go — as simple artisans, servants of sigmar or warriors — you will carry with you Sigmar's pride.\"\nThe other priests let their hands fall, ceasing their prayers. The murmur of entreaties stopped.\nAfter that we went back up to the surface and each took his way home. The cool late-afternoon air did nothing to clear my mind of what I had seen. The Empire had always been beset, but I had never understood it like that: only a few bore the weight of the truth, protecting everyone else. The prosperity of the streets, the celebrations, the calm of the cities… everything was held upright by a small group that kept constant watch while the rest lived in ignorance, unburdened by the weight I now carried on my shoulders.\n\"What's wrong, Georg? You've barely touched your food… we got the best cuts of beef for the occasion, so we can't waste them,\" my mother said, looking at me with concern. My brothers and sisters mirrored that inquisitive expression.\n\"It's nothing,\" I answered, cutting the piece of meat before me more slowly than usual.\n\"Georg,\" my father added in a firm voice, \"I spoke with your uncle. He says he needs someone good with numbers for his shop in Merxheim. He can give you work, two silver shillings a day… and you'd marry your cousin.\"\n\"Ah… yes…\" I murmured, nodding listlessly, my mind still in the temple's depths.\nThe door was struck suddenly, interrupting dinner. My father, irritated, got up to open it. When he did, several men of the Elector Count's personal guard stood there. The glow of their runed armor made my father go instantly on the defensive.\n\"Is the young Georg here?\" one of the guards asked.\n\"What do you want with him?… we want nothing to do with that noble,\" my father replied, his voice hardening.\n\"That noble?…\" one of the guards shot back, stepping forward with the look of a man ready to split my father's face.\nI rose from the table and stepped between them. \"It's me. What's happening?\" I asked seriously, holding his gaze.\n\"The Elector Count and Prince of Marienburg offers you immediate enlistment into his personal forces. Five silver shillings a day, runic plate armor and a runic weapon of your choice,\" the guard said, handing me a sealed document.\nI took it and read it quickly: it was a military service contract. It included payment of my wages, provision of armor, pensions in case of death or disability, loot rights and the duties as a member of the Elector Count's guard.\n\"Throw that nonsense away… no one will serve that Sigmarite. Deus Taal!\" my father managed to say, raising his voice, but he was cut off.\n\"DEUS TAAL CAN WHINE ALL HE WANTS! WE ARE THE TRUE DEFENDERS OF THE EMPIRE, THE SERVANTS OF SIGMAR!\" one of the guard shouted, his eyes alight with fervor, while silence fell over the house.\n\"What's your answer, boy — will you serve directly the Prince of Marienburg?\" said the senior guard, who bore a number of purity seals on his runic cuirass.\nI looked at my family… although they would never admit it, we lived better thanks to the Elector Count of the Westerlands, far better than we could have managed… but to keep all that safe… my duty to the Empire… to Sigmar… came first… my duty was to protect… to be a pillar of the Empire.\n\"Yes, I will serve,\" I answered.\n\"GEORG!\" my father shouted.\n\"Come on… we must issue your armor and weapons so you may swear the oath before Deus Sigmar,\" the lead guard said, taking me by the shoulder and leading me toward their barracks in Reinsfeld. As I turned, I only saw how my father clenched his fists and my mother wept.\nA bulwarks against the Lords of Chaos… that is what I am.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on novel⸺fire.net\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Inside here it feels warm, while outside the temperatures keep dropping by the day,\" said Katarin, her eyes wide, much like many of her witches, all surprised by the air of the place. I was watching the progress of the seed selection.\n\"It is a greenhouse. It maintains light and the optimal conditions for the plants. Thorek, tell me, how goes the seed selection?\" I asked while examining a few strains of wheat and barley already ready for harvest.\n\"I think I've done a good job, honestly,\" answered the dawi as he opened his notebook, covered in khazalid script. \"Let's see… strain four: thirty kernels. Strain five: thirty-three. Strain six: thirty-two. Strain seven: thirty-six. Strain eight: thirty-seven. Strain nine, the current one, forty-one kernels. I've taken care to choose the best seeds, the ones that seemed most promising, and I think I've made considerable progress for the little time I had. No doubt that with patience, in two hundred years of selection, you'll have great grains and abundant harvests,\" said Thorek, with the calm and perspective only a dwarf could have.\n\"And the barley?\" I asked while writing into my little book.\n\"It varies between twenty and twenty-four kernels. I've not managed to push it further, though I've taken care in selecting the best seeds. It seems not enough yet, but with perseverance we shall improve the results,\" he said, stroking his long beard.\n\"Good. This year you will stop the genetic selection. Produce enough seeds for the next sowing. We'll keep the barley and the best wheat seeds from this harvest, and with that we'll try to supply as much grain as possible to the new farms,\" I instructed firmly.\n\"Are you sure? If I continue at this pace, I'll soon reach the goal you set of fifty-five kernels. To stop now would be counterproductive. We need only keep working hard,\" said Thorek.\n\"Yes, I am sure, Thorek. Even a small increase is considerable when scaled up. Those gains could mean immediate aid,\" I answered while writing down all the seed values.\n\"Wait… wait… this grow food in winter?\" asked Katarin, her eyes wide.\n\"Yes, of course it produces food. Although, for now, I use it mainly as an agricultural study ground. Here I can select the best seeds. Do you have the data on carrots and potatoes, Thorek? I want to see if we should prepare large amounts of those seeds too,\" I said, turning toward the dawi.\n\"Kislev needs this… thousands of greenhouses, thousands in each province of Kislev. With that, the attacks against the Empire would end forever,\" said Katarin with a wide smile. It was rare to see her like that… too rare.\n\"No,\" Thorek and I answered at the same time, making her smile vanish.\n\"Why not? This could change Kislev forever. Our land is harsh, hard to work… if it could be made productive, it would save thousands from hunger,\" insisted Katarin.\n\"These are runes of our clan and allied clans,\" grumbled Thorek, frowning. \"We will not sell our runes to umgi we do not know. You may have friendship with our dawongi, but our craft and our runes are not sold to your kind… besides, who will maintain them to ensure they function as they must?\"\n\"Do you know how costly it is to produce one of these? Even if you had dawi willing to aid you, do you know how expensive it would be to build one in Kislev? First you'd have to assess the ground, see how thick the glass panels must be, the feasibility of water supply, the work of sealing everything… it will be complex and take much time. And for now I need the dawi runesmiths fulfilling the orders of unique armors and weapons I've demanded, so I cannot divert their work to this,\" I answered, walking out of the greenhouse to oversee the others.\n\"Come now, Albrecht, this is vital for Kislev… it could change the nation completely… strip much power from the boyars,\" said Katarin.\n\"My hands are tied, Katarin. I've invested much already to now invest more in Kislev and see all my work flowing away there… at the very least I need half a decade to recover my investments in agriculture, and I will not invest in lowering the price of food. That would be like shooting myself in the foot,\" I answered firmly.\n\"Tsh…\" muttered one of the ice witches as she watched us, and Katarin seemed to calm down, for at least she understood some of my reasons. After all, besides being a patriot of Kislev, she was a stateswoman.\n\"Very well, all in order for now. Thorek, I entrust you with the production of seeds. We must see them spread as much as possible in my lands,\" I said, closing the book as we began our return to Reinsfeld.\nWe finally boarded the train and rode back to the city, where for now all the work was taking place in the fields. Many were at work, harvesting the generous crops of my lands, for everything indicated it would be a new record harvest. The fields were full of life, while all labored to complete the tasks as swiftly as possible.\n\"Finally, payday… and it is no small thing to deliver wages to so many at once,\" I said with a smile while watching the harvests.\n\"How many people work for you?\" asked Katarin, looking at me seriously.\n\"All those you see. All the peasants work for me. You can imagine my annual cost, and why I need such reserves of gold and silver,\" I answered.\n\"All of them? Are you mad? How much gold do you spend on this?\" replied Katarin, her eyes wide as plates.\n\"I pay each peasant one silver shilling a day. That is around two hundred and fifty thousand souls, not counting the new Bretonnians, who will not be paid until next year, nor the industrial workers, who earn double though they are fewer. In total, a little over four hundred thousand golden crowns, about five million crowns a year,\" I said, making quick calculations.\n\"You… you spend five million crowns on that?\" murmured Katarin, clutching her head.\n\"Yes. But the harvest sells, on average, for triple what is invested, so it is a safe investment. And consider I have nearly a million Bretonnians working without pay yet. This year should be excellent for agricultural income, selling food across the Empire. The real profit lies in transforming it into beer, in bakeries, or in livestock. Warhorses sell well, as do the herds of cattle, pigs, and sheep we raise on my lands. So the investment is usually tripled or quadrupled, depending on how volatile the imperial food market is. And I have heard Kislev would be more than interested in buying grain,\" I replied with a smile.\n\"As long as you sell it at a fair price and don't play the tricks some imperial merchants commit by selling spoiled grain, there should be no problem with you being the one to sell to Kislev,\" said Katarin, still showing some irritation over the matter of the greenhouses.\n\"Of course… very well. Thorek, I leave the rest to you. Make sure to have seeds ready for as many of my estates as possible next year. I'll need plenty of supplies for the next campaign in Karaz Ankor,\" I ordered, turning to the dawi.\n\"Of course, dawongi. Nothing fills me with greater pride than knowing my work aids the liberation of more Karaks for the dawi,\" Thorek replied with enthusiasm before returning to his task.\nI still had much to do. I had neglected my duties for almost a year, and though the dawi had taken care of most of the heavy labor, there remained matters requiring my personal approval and which could not be delegated. Requests from trade cities to lower tariffs, contracts for the use of my trains across the Empire to reduce merchants' costs… it seemed several towns were financing their merchants through collective bargaining mechanisms to compete more effectively.\nAll this demanded intensive review and, of course, could not be delegated. I faced confinement among papers, conversations with ambassadors, and the assessment of treaties to decide whether they benefited me or not.\nBut there was something even more important. I had ordered the first recruitment among the graduates of Sigmar's schools, selecting youths of fifteen just out of them. For years they had been trained in the use of swords, axes, hammers, and firearms. Now, at last, they were ready to form part of a specialized force. It was a small contingent compared to the total number of graduates from my lands near Reinsfeld, but it represented the beginning of a different army, trained for this purpose.\nThose chosen by the Cult of Sigmar as possible members of the Silver Hammer were the ones I fixed my eyes upon. They had been shown the truth about the daemons and the gods of Chaos—only the basics, yet enough to shatter a weak mind. To know that truth and endure it made them far stronger, tempered for battles to come. And, of course, it made them the best candidates to fight daemons.\nI was certain this would become my new elite force: a unit dedicated solely to battling the creatures of Chaos that hid within the Empire's borders.\nIt was not long before we boarded the train back to Reinsfeld. Our immediate destination was the fortress-bank under my ownership, which was overflowing with activity. Not only were merchants and artisans requesting loans; hundreds of workers were hauling sacks and chests filled with freshly minted gold and silver coins.\nIn the square, behind the castle and Reinsfeld's administrative center, two hundred young men awaited me, those who had accepted my offer. A smaller group than I had expected, for I had calculated at least five hundred. But many had preferred to join the witch-hunters, or simply to pursue a civilian life.\n\"So, what are we doing here?\" asked Katarin, intrigued at the sight of the youths lined in formation.\n\"New recruits… your best future friends. Each of them is more resistant than most to the temptation of the daemons. And, in the future, they'll receive a dwarven ring against corruption. They'll be a bulwark, not only for the Empire but for Kislev as well,\" I replied, gesturing orders with my hand.\nMy men began unloading the dawi crates and, one after another, stacked great quantities of runic steel before the young men. They were ordered to find armor of their size, aided by veterans from my host who adjusted straps and plates until each piece fit as well as possible. Runic mail coats, full suits of reinforced plate, helmets inscribed with runes… each of those lads received gear worth thousands of golden crowns, as if the pieces had been custom-forged. Yet this was only the beginning: a force renewed year after year, in constant expansion, destined to spread across the Empire.\n\"I don't understand how you pay for all this at the same time,\" said Katarin, tilting her head in disbelief.\n\"My reserves. Helping the dawi pays very well. And right now I have reserves secured for two more years,\" I answered with a smile as I entered the bank.\n\"How? You've not sold anything yet. Where did you get so much gold and silver for your coffers? Are you transmuting lead?\" Katarin whispered, raising a brow.\n\"No, I'm not a fool. That would unleash savage inflation. This is little enough, as long as I keep it under control,\" I replied calmly.\n\"Then where did you get it?\" she pressed, following me into the bank, watching as my men unloaded chest after chest brimming with gold and silver coins.\n\"I had a conversation with the leader of the Imperial Bank Council. He was a clever man, full of grand ideas. So I requested a great loan from the bank… and he agreed,\" I said with a smile.\n\"Weren't you the leader of the council?\" Katarin asked, narrowing her eyes in suspicion.\n\"Ah, yes… I forgot to mention that detail. Yes, it was me. So I granted myself a loan of several million imperial crowns… at an interest of zero percent, eh? Ha, ha.\" I laughed while she shook her head.\n\"Come now, this funds the future campaigns,\" I added, watching as more and more chests of coins were carried in.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Looks like… the first of the dawi ships has reached Marienburg. Apparently they had one ready for delivery and decided to send it right away. And I have to pay… damn, half a million crowns for the vessel,\" I said, staring at the price of one of the ships I had ordered. I had commissioned three.\n\"What do you even want ships for? I thought it was the Emperor who spent his income defending the ports. Spending extra gold on defense seems rather unnecessary,\" Katarin remarked as she helped me review some permits.\n\"Being a trade middleman is lucrative, yes, but it's far better to be an active participant. Using my privileged position as the Empire's trade port I can acquire goods at prices no one else can and easily turn that difference into coin in my coffers. I need ships moving from Marienburg to the city-states and to be the one selling there. One must take advantage of the peace we have before dealing with the dawi, because that battle will be difficult,\" I replied, signing purchase orders for Tilea. They wanted to load several ships with cattle—apparently they were preparing for a banquet and did not want to slaughter their own herds for the festivity.\n\"I see… by the way,\" Katarin said, showing me one of the reports from the dwarven order concerning the trains. \"The first shipments of furs have arrived, as you asked. They're being sold at almost a giveaway price… we're paying our debt.\"\n\"Leave the Kislev permits here. I'll review those myself. I don't want to find out you've accepted any unilateral privilege for Kislevite merchants,\" I told her, while continuing to sign reports and permits that interested me.\n\"Hmm… interesting,\" murmured Katarin, leafing through one of the documents in front of us.\n\"What's interesting?\" I asked without looking up from the papers, focused on finishing that tedious work as quickly as possible.\n\"Apparently a merchant from some settlement in Lustria, after several failed attempts, managed to reach port a couple of days ago. His ships are badly damaged and currently in a shipyard for repairs. It seems he brought many things and wants to offer them to you first,\" she said, standing and placing the paper in front of me.\n\"Lustria…? Rare indeed are the voyages that make it back from there in one piece. At best they pass through Ulthuan, but Lustria… that must have been an interesting voyage. He probably brings something plundered from those lands. It's said there are massive temples full of gold… surely he has something curious,\" I answered, shrugging. \"Tell one of the guards to bring him. It will be interesting to see what he offers, so long as it isn't dangerous.\"\nKatarin left the office to alert the guards while I sped up my work. I had reached the point where only warehouse rental contracts and trade permits in the city remained to be signed.\nAt last Katarin returned, and we remained in complete silence, finishing the mountain of paperwork that had piled up. The volume was enormous, fruit of all the time I had neglected my administration and left it running on autopilot under my counselors.\nFinally, they brought in the merchant from Lustria. He turned out to be an Imperial from one of the colonies established on that continent. He wore the typical broad-brimmed hat, now adorned with brightly colored furs: reptilian scales, judging by their texture and sheen.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar, my good lord. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for granting me some of your most valuable time,\" said the merchant, doffing his hat with an exaggerated flourish, practically overflowing with confidence.\n\"Blessings of Sigmar. I hear you've brought goods from a voyage to Lustria… I suppose it must have been a hard one,\" I answered in a neutral tone, looking him straight in the eyes.\n\"It seems our lord Sigmar was merciful to this humble servant, my lord. Save for a storm that nearly tore down the mast, I can say it was a quiet voyage: no pirates, no sea monsters. Clearly we were blessed by His grace,\" he replied as his assistants moved to open several crates.\nI remained seated, observing. I felt the call of Chamon in those wares: an intense accumulation of gold.\n\"The finest adventurers of our illustrious city managed to defeat the two-footed lizards in Lustria and seize one of their temples. We thought that, given your illustrious title, you might be interested in such extraordinary objects,\" he said as he showed me statuettes of the lizardmen, carved in gold and inlaid with rubies or emeralds.\nOne glance with my magic was enough to see that gold had been smelted recently, no more than a year ago. Forgeries, crafted to deceive some credulous noble into believing he was buying ancient relics.\nI shook my head as he displayed more statues, until finally I found something that truly seemed authentic. I felt it old, at least a century in age. Enough to rule out a human hand in its creation or a recent forgery.\nIt was a helm of gold and bronze, clearly belonging to a lizard warrior. It bore no magical energy, so it must have been merely decorative, perhaps a war trophy or the ornament of a temple guardian who had fallen in its defense.\n\"Meh… don't you have anything more interesting? So far it's only gold. I could ask an honorable dawi to forge me pieces just the same, and he'd make them with much better quality,\" I said coldly, while the merchant opened another crate, growing more nervous as he saw nothing capture my interest.\n\"Well… I have some reptile skins, but not much else. If you'd like spices… I have cacao, my lord, if that interests you,\" said the merchant, rummaging through what little remained of his possessions.\n\"How long did your voyage take?\" I asked with interest.\n\"Two months, my lord,\" the merchant answered.\n\"Two months… those cacao seeds must be well dead by now. So then, how much did you bring? At the very least it will serve as something interesting to eat,\" I said, trying to diminish the value of what must have been a very costly product.\n\"We have a large quantity. An entire ship loaded with this product. Name your amount and we'll sell it to you,\" said the merchant.\n\"Fine… I want it. One ton of those cacao beans,\" I replied seriously.\n\"Well, that would be…\" The merchant pulled out his abacus and began shifting the pieces. \"Fifteen thousand crowns, my lord,\" he announced once his calculation was complete.\n\"Have the luxury tax deducted, and the difference will be paid. Move that cargo quickly to my warehouse,\" I ordered.\nThe merchant nodded, satisfied, and hurried out of the Marienburg palace.\n\"So you weren't interested in any of those strange artifacts from Lustria. Even my father would have bought one or two just to decorate and flaunt foreign influence,\" said Katarin, eyeing me with a mix of curiosity and reproach.\n\"They were forgeries, most of them. Perhaps he wouldn't have known, but I could feel it. That gold had been smelted recently, with mediocre techniques full of impurities. The helm was the only authentic piece, and it was obvious it had been crafted with magic—too perfect. But tell me, Kat… do you think a mage of Chamon will get excited about a gold statue when he can do this?\" I showed her a lead bullet and slowly transformed it into gold, the shining metal replacing the dull gray beneath my fingers.\n\"Yes, but that's temporary… and impossible to tell apart for anyone who isn't a mage of Chamon,\" she replied, watching the bullet with interest.\n\"Yes, temporary. Well… we need to go to the capital. I'm going to hire some mages, because now I need them more than ever,\" I said, closing the mountain of papers I had finally finished.\n\"Do you have something in mind for the cacao? Because clearly that was the only thing that caught your attention,\" said Katarin, lifting her ice staff.\n\"Of course. A mage of Ghyran could try to bring some of the cacao beans back to life and make them sprout. All we'd need is to adapt a greenhouse to the right temperature, humidity, and soil. With that, we could produce something very delicious… and, most importantly,\" I added, stepping closer to Katarin and taking her hands, \"we'd count on your valuable skill to freeze things.\"\nKatarin sighed heavily. \"Once again you'll have me lowering temperatures… My magic isn't for that, Albrecht. Remember you had me chilling your laboratory for two days when you made nitroglycerin.\"\n\"Oh, come now, my beautiful ice princess. You have one of the greatest talents of magic, just below Chamon and Ghyran… well, perhaps Hysh too. But you're among the most important,\" I said as I held her hand and guided her toward the train.\n\"And what do I have to do?\" asked Katarin, quickening her pace to keep up with mine.\n\"Nothing extraordinary. Grind the beans, mix them with a little cow's milk and sugar, heat them gently until they become a cacao paste, shape it, and then… that's where you come in, to cool it and make it perfect in the molds.\" I turned toward her, lifting her chin gently to meet her eyes. \"So you're very important… for making coins, of course. We'll be able to sell this for a fortune.\"\nKatarin fell silent, clinging to my arm as we walked quickly toward the train station. We loaded part of the cacao, enough to experiment with, because I had another objective in mind: to speak with several magisters of the Colleges of Magic. I wanted to recruit the younger ones for a very specific project. Likely I would have to found my own college, a valid excuse to gather mages of different lores in my city.\nI feared neither witch-hunters nor the mages themselves. With my knowledge of biology, chemistry, and physics, combined with magic, I could achieve things no one else in the Empire had ever imagined.\nGhryan could be used for plants… though, of course, they had to be kept properly nourished. Otherwise, accelerating their growth too much or altering their properties excessively could result in crops that were tasteless or of little nutritional value.\nBut, truthfully, that wasn't my main priority. The real reason I wanted to go to the capital was to recruit young mages—those who already controlled their magic but were still learning spells. That was the ideal moment to take them and shape them into something useful, away from the dogmas of the Colleges.\nEspecially those of Light. Integrating them into my forces, particularly among the newest recruits, was vital. Having a considerable number of battle mages dedicated to specific roles could mean the difference between victory and defeat. Jade, Light, even the Grey… every lore had its place.\nAnd if I had to spend the entire loan I had taken on establishing the conditions to found a college of battle mages in Reinsfeld, I would do so without hesitation.\nObviously, I wasn't naïve enough to think the Colleges would simply hand over their apprentices. I'd have to negotiate with magisters, convince some of those lores… and for that, I needed to offer them something they desired but could not obtain: materials and conditions forbidden or restricted by the Cult of Sigmar.\nI could produce valuable dyes and chemical compounds—elements and reagents useful for enchantments—thanks to the processes I was developing with the dawi. If I supplied those alchemical materials in great quantities, I could ask in return for periodic shipments of young mages. In exchange, I'd provide them with everything they needed for their experiments: infrastructure, raw materials, safe facilities, and relative freedom to research.\nWhile traveling with Katarin toward Altdorf, I was already preparing and writing down the necessary formulas for large-scale production: Reikland Blue pigments, special dyes, and other compounds I had been modifying with the help of the dawi. With those resources in hand, I would at least ensure they heard me out.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

From now ye be my workers. If folk ask ye somethin', point at me. I deal with it. Less ye speak, faster we done,\" I said while walkin' to the market to sell the goods I got from the Empire stalls.\nI had me usual spot, where other traders came to buy. They took wine, cloth, dyes, candles, clothes, sold 'em from village to village. Plenty o' that in Marienburg, more now with trade growin' mad.\nSoon as always, buyers came. I sold fast as I could. Times were bad, kingdom losin' lands, king makin' poor choice, knights with no fiefs crowdin' towns. They take what they can, livin' fat while we toil hard.\n\"You there, commoner!\" said a knight, comin' with his men-at-arms. He pointed straight at me. \"Have you any gold coins to deliver?\"\n\"No, m'lord…\" I answered, head down. \"I always serve law proper. Only silver I got, as rule says.\" I dared not look him, else he call me rebel.\nThe knight muttered, then smirked. \"Remember this: if you should ever hold gold… I shall take care of delivering it for you.\" Then he went on, doin' the same with other traders, like it were daily work.\nAin't strange seein' such things. Knights also steal folk. Many got empty lands in border duchies, no peasants there. So they grab people, make 'em work 'til they die. Miserable knights…\nI hurried sellin' what I could. Trade no feel like trade no more, just strugglin' to live. When done, I bought supplies for caravan; had to go back Marienburg soon. Gathered me new \"folk,\" loaded wagons, tied oxen, and left town.\nL'Anguille still busy with trade, but times changed. Trade with Empire stuck. Neighbourin' duchies of new Imperial March ask heavy tolls, tryin' to claw back gold, only pushin' merchants north. There, taxes still high, but at least same.\nBefore leavin', I did what I always do: looked for more hands to join caravan. Never know when beasts or bandits strike—more and more these days… unless ye rather be robbed by Bretonnian nobles themselves, callin' themselves protectors while takin' all coin.\n\"Halt! Have you paid your taxes to our lord?\" said a man-at-arms, eyes narrow, watchin' my wagons.\n\"Of course, I always pay me dues, to lord and to realm,\" I said, with fake smile well-practiced.\nThe guard frowned. \"Why so many children in your wagons, merchant?\" he asked, steppin' close to see the folk inside.\n\"Teach 'em work young,\" I said calm, showin' him the stamped tax paper. \"Small hands still help with cloth an' clothes. I need folk if I keep trade with Empire.\"\nHe still doubted, then spat on ground. \"If you paid, move along quick.\" He let us pass—seemed he couldn't even read the paper I showed.\nI gave the word, oxen pulled wagons slow over the cobbles out the gate. Once past the castle, many sighed in relief. Hardest part done. Truth be, most o' me \"workers\" not real. They were peasants runnin' away. Kingdom give 'em no hope. Taxes too heavy, knights more cruel each day, and any fault met with rope or lash.\nMe work had changed. I still hauled goods, aye, but now it just cover. Truth was, I take peasants out o' Bretonnia, bring 'em to the Empire. We put 'em in a walled town like naught happened. Wait some days 'til the hunt for serfs calm down, then I use tax papers to make 'em pass as hired folk. Merchants, so long as we pay, can bring people in.\nWhere else could they go? Only the Empire, maybe free from chains. It started with families seekin' sons, brothers lost after war. Some got luck, others not. Lords forced 'em out before they could be saved.\nWhat began small grew big. No longer just few families—dozens, then hundreds. I not alone, but few can move folk quiet. Bretonnian folk settlin' in Empire soon saw truth: weren't the poor the problem, but knights, barons, dukes themselves—servin' the cursed Lady, bindin' us all to misery.\nHelp came quick: gold, food, contacts. With that, what was just rescue turned into a movement. Knights tried to stop us, but they were busy guardin' borders; an army sat always in the old duchies, and folk feared another Imperial invasion that, they said, would come to \"liberate\" us. While no freedom came, we had no choice but take the road ourselves, toward the Empire.\nSo we walked on, tryin' to look normal, stoppin' now and then to pick herbs or other things we could sell in Imperial markets. Had to look busy—empty wagons made folk suspicious.\nCrossin' into Couronne, we paid the river toll and, like always, I played my trick. Set the net to work: spoke with peasants, found families ready to risk it. That same night, with other traders in the net, we moved dozens from nearby villages. We spent barrels o' wine to get guards drunk, so whole families slipped through from one night to the next.\nCome mornin', when castle gates opened, we entered as simple merchants, carryin' wares like nothin' strange. We hid the runaways in cellars and lofts of friends still loyal in the town. Days went by, us watchin' knights marchin' the streets, desperate, huntin' for serfs. Disgustin', aye, but we expected it.\nLuck weren't always with us. Fools got caught, punished in the square, whipped or hanged as warnin' to all. Still, for every one they caught, many more made it. Had to learn not to move when knights dragged one of ours, beatin' him near to death. Better keep still than die showin' heroics.\nWhen the hunt cooled, when knights gave up—or more so, couldn't find us—we paid the tolls and set out back to the Empire. That road was watched by knights and an Imperial garrison, so the worst dangers were greed and laziness of lords, not common bandits.\nMarchin' on, I heard thunder of a great army. Cannons boomed through the hills; some battle up there, though I knew not who nor why. Truth be told, I didn't care. We kept on 'til one of the new Imperial frontier towns, near Castle Tancred. Paid the Imperial dues, and I readied to send me folk away.\n\"Alright,\" I told 'em. \"Go find the mayor. My work here's done. He'll ask ye things, answer straight. Sigmar's folk help brothers, even if ye don't know their faith.\"\n\"Is… there work?\" one father asked, voice breakin' with relief.\n\"The Champion of Sigmar, lord of this land, gives jobs as town needs. Harvest done, so not the fields, but maybe carryin' goods or other chores. Pay's fair, ye won't starve like in Bretonnia. Depends on the season—spring brings more work—but now, likely movin' wares,\" I said calm.\n\"Thank ye for all,\" said a mother, holdin' her children close.\n\"Just doin' me duty,\" I answered. \"Sigmar bless ye, have a good day.\" I turned and walked to the place where we were meant to gather.\nDidn't take long to reach the tavern. Most were already splittin' the funds for the next trip; more gifts had come from towns supportin' us.\n\"How it go?\" asked one trader when I came in.\n\"Fine… I reckon. They caught one of ours in Couronne. Hung him in the square… another victim o' them butchers,\" I said bitter.\n\"Blessed Sigmar watches him now. He knew what he did when he joined us, and his sacrifice saved hundreds, if not thousands. May he rest in Morr's gardens,\" said my companion.\n\"Aye… but they sharper now. We need another path. Each time harder, knights fillin' the roads with guards. Still, I pulled near a hundred out o' that hell,\" I said, droppin' into a chair.\n\"A hundred?\" —the innkeep scratched in his book—. \"That makes three thousand this week. We doin' well, though them extra guards will be trouble.\"\n\"What if we try Artois? Border with the March is wide, they can't watch all the ways,\" said another trader sittin' by me.\n\"Beastmen there, real nasty. We'd need armed escort. And bandits too… we'd lose many if we try that road,\" I answered.\n\"I know old men-at-arms, once served knights, now guardin' for Bretonnian traders. I could speak to 'em. If they agree, maybe we move through Artois woods,\" said the innkeep.\n\"Maybe… Think the Empire finish what they started? They had Bretonnia broken, but didn't take it all. Why stop?\" I asked, lips tight.\n\"I doubt it,\" said the innkeep. \"For some reason they stopped. Don't think they come again soon. The Champion of Sigmar looks elsewhere. So we keep on this road we chose… 'til the bitter end.\"\n\"To the bitter end,\" I echoed, liftin' me mug. More of our folk raised theirs. The thump of wood hit the table as we drank in silence, knowin' each trip was another gamble in a deadly game against our own lords.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

This one is runic, with a rune of restoration; this enchanted with Ghyran to strengthen regeneration. This other draws from the wind of Chamon: it repairs metal every few seconds—it is my own creation, I had thought to add it to my weapons. Here is one of Hysh, to help steady the mind. These are what I have; the others should have arrived, but they are delayed.\"\nI studied him for a moment, weighing the similar effects of several of the rings. \"The dawi ring is the most fitting. It shows your wife also seeks to bind herself closer to the dwarfs.\"\nAlbrecht nodded and carefully set the rings back into the box. \"I only hope she will like it.\"\nI raised a brow. \"Are you having trouble with Katarin?\" I asked, mindful of the alliance with Kislev.\n\"Not at all,\" Albrecht answered, calm but strained. \"She has been steadier since we aided Kislev; letters say the realm is recovering after the defeat of the Chaos host. Her urgent calls have ceased, and now she conducts herself as one would expect—cold, distant… though at times she smiles. I only pray this does not sour into a venomous marriage.\"\n\"It should not,\" I replied, fixing him with a steady gaze. \"Unless all I know of you is false, I see no reason for disaster. You fret over which ring to give her as a token, and you keep no mistresses—known ones, at least. Beyond your manner, there is little cause for her contempt.\"\nAlbrecht exhaled deeply and closed the lid of the box. \"Was it truly necessary for so many nobles to attend the ceremony? I would have preferred something private, without the Empire's fanfare.\"\n\"This is an alliance of the highest order,\" I said. \"The nobility must witness it, and they must know the Emperor's hand supports the union. The plan to bind Kislev as vassal must be made plain—though the true circumstances that led you into this match with the Tsar and his daughter are another matter entirely. And with those loans from the Imperial Bank, I trust you have little reason to complain of the marriage.\"\nAlbrecht fell silent, thoughtful, a faint smile crossing his face. I pressed him with a difficult question. \"After your marriage—and I know my father will want to ask the same—have you any notion why the Bretonnians flee en masse into your lands? The Bretonnian envoy presses us to act, and I know not how to halt it without imposing heavy restrictions on trade, which would anger the merchants. So I ask you: do you have anything to do with it?\"\n\"What?\" said Albrecht, surprised. \"I have no knowledge of that… though it might explain that increase in population beyond my plans. The problem is, I do not yet know how many heads there are: the census has not been taken. But no, Franz. My priorities are clear: first the dawi; then cleansing the forests of beastmen and dealing with the necromancers; and only then, if the Bretonnians keep sending knights intent on killing me, would I consider action against Bretonnia. For now, I will not involve myself in a Bretonnian campaign. I have affairs with the dawi and preparations ahead; then I shall look north to aid Kislev. This has nothing to do with me.\"\nI nodded, convinced of his sincerity: he had ever been methodical and focused upon his goals. \"I am glad to hear it. I suppose you will be preparing; all takes place soon, does it not?\" I said, gathering my cloak.\n\"A couple of hours yet, but it is better to be ready. I will not arrive late to my own wedding—Katarin would never forgive me,\" said Albrecht, smiling with a mixture of nerves and relief.\nQuickly, the champion of Sigmar left the palace for the cathedral, occupied with the last arrangements of a wedding already spoken of throughout the city. What had been kept secret had swiftly turned to rumor; the local papers carried the news, and the taverns repeated the wildest tales brought in by Reikguard spies.\nNo expense had been spared in security: ambassadors of other nations would attend, and the risk of an attempt compelled stricter measures. Hundreds of Reikguard watched the streets around the cathedral; warrior-priests and witch hunters rotated through the guard shifts; wizards remained alert to any indiscreet use of magic that might endanger the ceremony. In the week before, witch hunters had doubled their patrols across the city, and after thorough investigations had seized two suspect groups, proven guilty and already paraded in the square.\nWe had done all we could to ensure success; moreover, several Electors would attend, for one of their number was to be wed.\nI reviewed the last security reports delivered to me by Reikguard agents and the city guard commanders: all was in order. With my father and sister, I rode by carriage to the cathedral adjoining the Imperial Palace; we were among the first of the high nobility to arrive. Passing through the sea of pilgrims and townsfolk eager to witness the ceremony, I noted the blend of curiosity and devotion: it was striking that the faith which had hunted wizards for centuries now stood to bless the marriage of two of them.\nWe took our seats of honor, from where we could see both the readers and arch-lectors of the Cult, as well as the greater part of the Electors who had accepted the invitation. Conversations around us circled the recent incidents in the city, the cults uncovered, and the aid dispatched to Stirland; men and women traded rumors and conjecture in hushed tones as we waited.\nAlbrecht arrived as always: sheathed in an immaculate blue coat that made plain he could afford fabrics and pigments denied to most. The row of buttons, the work of runic smiths, gleamed with a flawless finish; the adornments at the collar and forearm bore inlays crafted by dawi runesmiths. A chain of blessed silver crossed his chest on the left, from which several Sigmar medallions hung. Matching blue trousers and a sword at his side completed the image; his black leather boots were sober, yet the value of the runic fittings and dyes could well equal the price of a house in the noble quarter.\nKatarin appeared in keeping with Kislevite custom: layered cloaks and furs, tanned and dyed a pale blue. She carried small enchanted trinkets, rings and amulets that gave off a chill—more austere than her husband's presence. The contrast between them was telling, and made it quickly clear which of the two was the wealthier.\nAs they walked smiling, the great theogonist waited beneath the imposing statue of Sigmar that watched over the square.\n\"My Emperor, we have a problem,\" one of the Reikguard spies whispered.\n\"What is it? Is it grave?\" my father asked without turning his gaze from the ceremony, though his smile tightened.\n\"The matter is diplomatic and could escalate to war. The Bretonnian ambassador demands an immediate audience and also calls for a representative of the witch hunters.\" The spy spoke low, trying not to alarm those nearby.\n\"What happened that has the Bretonnian ambassador so enraged?\" I asked the spy.\n\"An incident with Damsels of the Grail inside Imperial territory,\" he began, hurried to explain.\n\"Damsels of the Grail inside the Empire? Have the Bretonnians lost their minds? Those women serve only their king and dukes; it must have been a Bretonnian action… what exactly happened?\" I said, noting the spy's hesitation as the carriage moved.\n\"According to the witch hunter, they were attempting to take a group of women from the villages of the Westerlands to serve their goddess. A contingent of witch hunters, supported by a local Bretonnian and members of the elector count's garrison, intervened. It ended in a fight in the city: three witch hunters and ten garrison men died, and the Damsels were killed by a priest of Sigmar and other witch hunters in the area.\"\n\"Damn…\" I muttered. \"This will put Albrecht straight on their necks—he is most aggressive with such offenses. I cannot imagine how he will take this when he learns it all. Is that why the ambassador is furious? We should be the ones demanding explanations.\" I brought my hand to my face, incredulous at the scale of the disaster.\nThe spy raised his shoulders. \"I do not know, my Prince. It seems the ambassador was informed that three Damsels had been killed and claimed those servants remained the property of Bretonnia, that this property had never been recognized as anything else, and that the murder of Damsels attempting to be taken—something belonging to the realm—was a grave offense,\" the spy said, wearing a face that showed he could hardly believe what the ambassador was alleging.\n\"These blasted Bretonnians making a scene…\" I mumbled between my teeth. \"Knowing Albrecht, he will want heads to roll. After the purge he carried out against that tribe of green skins near the Pale Sisters, I would not be surprised if he provoked an invasion of Bretonnia. Exactly what we do not need: one of the elector counts already making everyone nervous with his growing power. I am certain he will crush the Bretonnians if he decides to. What shall we do… will he accept that we do not expand his territory further?\"\nThe spy forced a tight smile; his teeth showed the strain. \"Do you not think negotiation might be possible?\"\n\"Negotiate?\" I repeated, incredulous. \"For Sigmar's sake, with what face could I negotiate when neither Bretonnia nor Albrecht will yield? If Bretonnia thinks it can enter Imperial lands to retrieve a chosen of their goddess as if nothing happened, we are in trouble. I very much doubt they seek a peaceful solution. If we demand reparations, they will grow angrier if they believe themselves right.\"\nI closed my eyes for a second and ran my hand across my face, exhausted. \"And Albrecht… that case is lost. Unless Bretonnia humiliates itself and begs pardon on its knees, he will throw himself upon them until they are dead.\nAt last we returned to the palace, which remained calm, ignorant of the chaos being stirred.\n\"Let us hope this finishes without ruining the night by telling him now… we cannot spoil this evening by giving him this news. Let us pray no one informs him, or he will be very angry. Negotiation is likely lost, but I will see what I can do and try to bring the Bretonnians to reason,\" I said as I walked toward where the ambassador was to be found, waiting.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I had imagined a small ceremony, with a few priests of Sigmar, the Grand Theogonist, and some close friends like Duran. Nothing more.\nBut what took place was a colossal festivity. Outside the cathedral throngs of pilgrims crowded together to catch even a glimpse, and the streets were overflowing thanks to the banquet the Emperor had ordered: food and drink were distributed in immense quantities to any who wished to join the celebration.\nAmbassadors from other nations came, along with multitudes of nobles. The cathedral was packed, every seat taken, all to witness the ceremony in Sigmar's name, where the Grand Theogonist joined Katarin and me in marriage.And that was not even the worst of it for our private life.\nThe priestesses of Shallya took Katarin to examine her purity, and soon it became public that her maidenhood remained intact. I would have greatly preferred such a detail kept quiet, but no— it became the centerpiece of the day. For hours the whispers and jests revolved around my virility and Katarin's fertility.\nI was uncomfortable; I loathe excessive attention, and now everything turned upon matters that should belong to the private. I would not have been surprised to find my private life written in the morning gazettes, so much was it spoken of in the halls and the streets.\nAfter all that chaos, at least the ceremony ended with a banquet in the Imperial Palace. There were endless dances which, as guest of honor, I found tedious. At least now that I was wed, many of the ladies who used to approach me kept their distance… though a few still tried. Katarin, however, had changed since the union: more possessive, her cold gaze piercing every woman who came near me, whether for politics or for business.\nFor the first time I enjoyed a banquet in peace. Duran was in high spirits, drinking Bugman's ale as if it were water, laughing at the whole affair. Between toasts he promised me that when his turn came to wed a dawi of good standing, he would invite me to his marriage. Of course, that would be at least a decade or more away, for he was still young by dawi standards and still seeking the right alliance with a king who could bring him prestige.\nThe alliance with Kislev was now reality: in the eyes of all, the marriage had been consummated, despite all precautions and secrecy meant to prevent leaks. It was, however, a matter of the past; the night had ended.\nWhen I awoke, I still felt the fatigue of the banquet. Katarin lay at my side, naked and asleep, the pillow marked by the drool she had left in her rest. Moving carefully so as not to wake her, I drew on my left gauntlet and, by sheer habit—too accustomed never to remove them—slipped on my rings. They were part of me as I began the day.\n\"Where are you going?\" Katarin asked, half-rising, her voice still caught in sleep.\n\"I am going to see how our guests fare. You know the dawi grow quarrelsome when they drink; besides, I must get them a few more barrels of Bugman's ale so they can drink themselves to sleep.\" I answered with the calm I pretended to feel.\nShe nodded without a word, fussing with the sheets as I rose.\nWhen I entered the chamber where the dawi had been lodged, I found them again lost in their drinking, savoring each draught with the seriousness of those who regard ale as nearly food. No surprise: the dwarfen recipe was famed for being nourishing and hearty; many could live off it for days. It was no wonder to see them drinking without thought of food.\n\"Duran, my friend… tell me, have my lodgings been worthy?\" I asked the thane, looking over the piles of mugs and the rows of barrels.\n\"Ah… Dawongi… of course they have. I thank you for the invitation to be here, especially for your vast reserves of Bugman's. You've bought enough ale to sate a true hall of warriors.\" Duran pointed at the casks meant for thousands.\n\"I am glad to hear it… nothing pleases me more than knowing I have been a good host to my dawi friends. Ah, I nearly forgot—thank you for having your runesmiths aid me with the last details of my attire. I did not know how else to add value to something so simple, and the Emperor kept insisting, and insisting, that I must show economic power, that I could not simply go in plain blue cloth, for it would make me look poor and lacking in strength,\" I said, watching them still drinking.\n\"Ah, yes… showing power is important. No one likes a lord who shows no wealth. Can you imagine High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer walking? Ridiculous! The thought alone makes my beard bristle. The High King must ever remain upon his throne,\" Duran said gravely.\n\"True… though personally I dislike it. I find no joy in flaunting riches. But so be it… this year will be a great year, my friend. We go to Karak Eight Peaks, and this time we shall recover the fortress—or at the very least give all aid we can. We have a direct train to Karaz-a-Karak that will take us in a few days, and first I must only make a short journey to Kislev, where there will be a second ceremony. Thus I will fulfill my promise to aid the dawi in reclaiming what is theirs from the greenskins and the thagoraki.\"\nMy thoughts were already upon the campaign, the battles to come, and the wealth that might be found in one of the greatest fortresses of the Old World.\n\"I am glad to hear it. Any aid is welcome, especially yours and that of your personal army. I do not believe there is any better ally to support our honorable people in that mission.\" Duran smiled, turning his head to look at something.\nWhen I turned, I saw Katarin had already returned, dressed in her usual garb, taking my right arm.\n\"So this is the lady of high birth from that northern empire… I hope the dowry was worthy, for she does not look fat enough,\" Duran said in a watchful tone, his eyes on Katarin.\n\"Thank you?\" she replied coldly.\n\"For them, a plump, curvy woman is the most attractive thing they can find,\" I whispered to her.\n\"That's true, my friend — my beautiful wife.\" I put an arm around her and drew her to my waist.\n\"I'm glad to hear it. May Valaya bless your union and grant you many children! May they be friends of my future descendants, and may our friendship endure through the generations.\" Duran raised his mug; his kin and warriors followed suit.\nKatarin rested her head on my shoulder as she watched the scene, and for a few moments I felt something strange: the happiness of possessing what had once been denied to me.\nA metallic clatter pulled me from my thoughts. Turning my head, I saw one of my guards standing stiffly, waiting to address me.\n\"What is it?\" I asked, taking Katarin's hand.\n\"My lord… we have received word of an attack. A group of Bretonnian Damsels crossed the border without our notice. They reached one of the new villages and tried to take several women. Fortunately, the populace raised such an outcry that it alerted the witch hunters; otherwise they would have escaped without difficulty.\"\n\"Bretonnia…? Were there casualties or did they only flee?\" I asked, clenching my fist.\n\"There was a fight, sir. The sorceresses fought the witch hunters and the guards. They were shot down, but thirteen of our men fell in the skirmish. Hours later knights of the Grail arrived to recover the bodies. There was another clash and five more of our men fell before we managed to stop them.\"\n\"Shall we cancel the plans… and march to Bretonnia?\" Katarin asked, looking at me with determination.\n\"Ah… those manlings, how dare they! Right on such an important day.\" Duran sprang up, filled with fury.\n\"It is serious, but I do not think it warrants going to Bretonnia… not now.\" I said, watching Duran's obvious consternation. \"I can think of punishments that will hurt them a thousand times more than a defeat in the field. For the moment, everything remains as planned, except that we probably will not set out for Kislev immediately. I will have to speak with some people to see if something feasible can be arranged.\"\n\"Dawongi, you need not throw yourself away to help the dawi if your honour is unresolved. We understand there are more important matters.\" Duran spoke calmly, though his hands would not stop trembling.\n\"Calm yourself. I have a plan to strike back without going in person. Helping the dawi remains my priority, but that does not mean I will not seek vengeance. They will pay dearly.\" I said, with Katarin at my side and leaving the hall.\n\"What will we do, then, since you do not wish to go to Bretonnia?\" Katarin asked, looking at me with resolve.\n\"If I go to Bretonnia now, I will not obtain the gold we need to fund the works and the troops. I want to crush them, believe me, but we would gain no wealth: only more debt. To make the Bretonnians productive again will require spending a great deal of coin; what I have now is borrowed and I cannot keep taking loans indefinitely without causing inflation. I need the dawi's gold for that—if spent correctly, it avoids those inflationary effects. That is why we cannot abandon the dawi or fail to visit them.\" I answered, weighing every word.\n\"Then what shall we do? Your reputation with the dwarfs is vital; all that runic armament you obtained through them is an economic and political asset. We cannot afford to lose that alliance.\" Katarin spoke seriously.\n\"I know. I have an idea: I cannot go to Bretonnia immediately. The notion of burning some ducal seat as reprisal would take months at best, and I would rather not it would mean facing hundreds of Bretonnian sorceresses.''i said\nand I would also have to deal with a magical duel against the Fay Enchantress, unless I can find a way to eliminate her beforehand.\n\"I will see if I can gather some men from Kislev to join your forces. They may not be many, but you've seen they lack not for courage,\" Katarin said.\n\"Thanks,\" I replied. \"That helps. I also know where to find more men, although I never liked the idea of recruiting Bretonnians. Even so, I can raise an army with them. The problem remains the gold. We will secure war funds by aiding the dawi; when we have the resources, we will launch the campaign against Bretonnia, probably in winter, using your witches' magic so the cold does not kill us. For now I will tell my dwarf friends that revenge will come later: everything is planned, and when we return from Karaz-a-Karak laden with gold, Bretonnia will burn.\" I said, tracing the strategy in my mind.\n\"Very well,\" Katarin answered. \"I will go to Kislev to inform my father and see if he can send troops to aid you in the campaign.\" She looked at me firmly, as if already mapping the war.\nI nodded and donned my armor. Everything required the appearance of movement: we had to seem ready to take immediate measures against Bretonnia. I requested an audience with the Emperor; I asked for time while diplomatic channels attempted to resolve the matter before I launched any strike. It was a perfect excuse: in the dawi's eyes, following the orders of one's superiors is sacred, and as long as the grievance rested with the hierarchy, honour would be deemed in the process of being addressed. In the end, by seeming to have followed proper channels, all would be well.\nAfterward I went to Marienburg with the aim of beginning to recruit a force of Bretonnians who would appear destined to return to their lands: thus, when the time came to demonstrate readiness for war, I could show movement and organisation without spending now the gold we need for our works.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The knights of Bretonnia were convinced that the Empire still retained their property — their serfs — because the imperial–Bretonnian peace treaty made no explicit mention of them; to the Bretonnians, what was not written down remained theirs. They had demanded the return of those serfs on several occasions: labour was scarce in Bretonnia. Many knights who had lost their lordships now saw vast, empty estates divided among them, but they had no one to work the land.\nThat desperation explained the knights' audacity: when the Damsels of the Grail arrived urgently seeking sorceresses — accompanied by their knights and paying little heed to borders — they did not hesitate to enter my domains. They had taken five young women with magical aptitude from various villages; that was why they ventured so far. I, for my part, immediately incorporated the apprentices; sorceresses of Ghyran would be useful to me in the future.\nNot everything went badly, but the grievance and public offence remained. I therefore decided to close trade with Bretonnia: I forbade Bretonnian goods from entering my markets and rescinded the leases on properties held by Bretonnian merchants. The measure included expelling their traders from my cities.\nNo sooner had I issued the order than complaints from Bretonnian merchants began to arrive. The more they complained, the more convinced I became that the consequences should be made sterner. The Bretonnians depended on our markets to sell their grain and other goods; blocking their commercial access would strike them a severe blow. I also prepared a letter for my good friend, the Elector of the Imperial March, asking him to apply the same policy: a general imperial embargo on trade with Bretonnia. Thus the Bretonnians would be forced to turn to Estalia, and their trading network would suffer greatly compared with the connection they had with us.\nAs I finished drafting the letter to Joachim — explaining what I expected him to do to close all bridges to the Empire, and promising to reimburse his expenses — one of my guards entered on quiet feet.\n\"My lord… merchants request an audience,\" he murmured, opening the door carefully so as not to interrupt.\n\"I have already said I will not hear Bretonnian merchants. Their complaints will not be heard nor considered,\" I answered sternly, letting the quill fall into the inkwell.\n\"They are merchants from your lands, though Breton-born… they beg an audience despite your full schedule,\" the guard insisted.\n\"Bah. Very well — bring them in. I will hear them, but I will not change the rules on their account.\" I motioned for them to be admitted.\nA few minutes later a group of merchants entered my study; as they did so they knelt, nearly touching the floor with their foreheads. One of them spoke without looking up.\n\"M'lord, thank you for your time. May Sigmar bless you this day!\" he said in a trembling voice.\n\"Sigmar's blessings. Tell me: what can I do for you? And please, raise your heads.\" I watched the display with composure.\nThe merchants, visibly frightened, rose carefully, avoiding eye contact. One drew a breath and spoke haltingly.\n\"My lord, your order —though right— has caused us great harm, because… because…\" His voice broke.\n\"I understand. This affects your income and your livelihood, but you must appreciate that the Bretonnians have behaved increasingly erratically. I must punish them; not long ago they attempted to abduct women from my villages. I cannot permit that, and so I cannot reverse this decision.\" I spoke calmly, fixing my gaze on the leader of the group, who was sweating with nervousness.\n\"No… no, m'lord… what happened is that we…\" the merchant stammered, bowing his head again. \"We have been acting in your name and using your reputation for our benefit, trying to save more people who suffer under the lady' serfs.\"\n\"So you are the ones who organised those mysterious population increases my men could not explain?\" I asked, sceptical.\n\"Yes, my lord. We could not ignore Sigmar's teaching to protect humanity. The worshippers of the Lady treat our people like filth; we could not stand idly by while others suffered. We beg your mercy… but understand that this is how we tried to help. If you block our trade, we cannot continue.\" His voice cracked at the end, thick with fear.\n\"I see… this may well be the root of the entire problem. The Bretonnians are desperate; they have no one to till their fields and are becoming erratic from the lack of labour. It is likely, for that reason, that they are demanding I return all Bretonnians who have come into my lands,\" I said, watching the merchants.\n\"We're sorry, m'lord… truly,\" one of them replied in a shaky voice. \"But we had to do something. The abuses have only worsened in recent months; the knights have gone mad with their dealings — people can't bear it any longer.\"\n\"And in the end, how many did you bring? I do not have an exact figure, only an estimate. I would like to know how many people we are speaking of that you managed to extract,\" I asked, leaning forward with interest.\n\"I… I have the book, m'lord. We keep a register where we write all those we managed to get out of Bretonnia,\" another merchant said, drawing a big ledger from his clothes and showing it to me.\nI signalled to one of my guards, who took the book and handed it to me. I opened it and scanned the pages filled with numbers and names.\n\"Crude notes, but legible. They exceed one hundred thousand. That explains why the expenditures did not add up, and why my architects kept asking me for more and more funds,\" I said with a slight laugh, while the merchants grew nervous again.\n\"It is what we managed with our network of helpers,\" said the merchant who had handed me the book.\n\"A network of helpers?… so this runs deeper than one might expect, does it?\" I asked with a small smile.\n\"Yes, m'lord… many hate the knights and they're tired; they don't fear risking flight. We take care to help them, doing our duty as merchants,\" the leader answered again.\n\"I see… interesting. Tell me, how do you finance this? It is curious, because even with all the income you might obtain selling in Bretonnian markets it would not cover transport and supplies. You have moved an enormous number of people; what you have done is worthy of note,\" I said, surprised by the audacity and organisation of those Bretonnians.\n\"All this is paid for by the Bretonnian communities, m'lord. Every month the people gather and make donations which we distribute among ourselves to fund the purchase of goods; that way we justify needing to hire many workers and bringing them back into the Empire. If we did not do that, it would be far too obvious what we are doing.\" The merchant bowed his head with humility.\n\"What a pleasant surprise… Who would have thought the Bretonnians could be so united in their suffering, that they would sacrifice to pay for this?\" I said, surprised and somewhat moved.\n\"That is good to hear. Sigmar must be pleased with your devotion to protect humanity from those vile servants of the one who calls herself the Lady of the Lake. I understand your petition and I believe it will be prudent not to carry out the changes…\" I said, signalling to a guard. \"Notify the heralds and let nothing change.\"\n\"Thank ye, m'lord… many thanks!\" the merchants exclaimed, lowering their heads in relief.\n\"Enough with the reverence; I look like a tyrant. Continue your work as before. You might, if necessary, go to some temple of Sigmar and ask for monetary support for this cause; I doubt they will refuse. That said: be sure to say it was not my idea, that would be problematic. What you have done, however, deserves proper recompense.\" I offered a faint smile.\nThe merchants regained heart; they began to lift their heads and prepare to leave.\n\"One more thing… only one more thing, if you will permit. Using your connections, could you send a message to the Bretonnian communities? I am considering a future recruitment to finish the work I began years ago. I will require soldiers willing to fight; there may be losses in my next campaign and I will need men to hold positions. Would it be feasible for you to temporarily finance the training of a Bretonnian military force while, in parallel, my veterans train several thousand Bretonnian youths? We would provide the weapons and place some of our veterans as instructors; what I ask is that you fund wages and food during that period.\" I watched their reactions, interested to gauge their decision.\nThe merchants turned and watched one another in silence. \"you plan, m'lord… excuse us,\" said the leader, kneeling and bowing his head. \"you plans to attack Bretonnia again?\"\n\"Yes — at the end of the year, if all goes well I will march on the Bretonnian capital to set it afire, kill as many knights as I can, and break once and for all that realm of tyrants and free everyone from the yoke of that Lady so that they may live according to what Sigmar teaches,\" I replied gravely.\nThe merchants began to pray in silence, giving thanks to Sigmar. \"That is great news, m'lord. I am sure all who support us will be eager to finance and join an army to uproot once and for all the damned, corrupt yoke the Lady exercises over men. We shall do all we can to raise more. Thousands will be willing to serve Sigmar,\" the leader of the merchants said.\n\"Very well… proceed with what you were doing. I will ensure you are supplied with weapons for the training and will send some of my veterans as instructors,\" I answered with a smile.\nThe merchants left in high spirits, speaking excitedly among themselves. I, for my part, took advantage of the opportunity: I mobilised arms and troops that required no immediate pay. I had all the stores awaiting authorised buyers brought to Marienburg; they would suffice to equip the Bretonnians. With weapons, armour, and discipline they could form a wall of flesh capable of withstanding Bretonnian cavalry charges, and they would serve as leverage to provoke mass desertions among the enemy ranks and encourage peasants to rebel before each clash.\nNot a week passed before volunteers began to arrive. At that moment I could not afford to choose only the tallest or strongest: these were soldiers I did not need to pay or feed, many of them financed their own equipment or were supported by the communities that sent them. While I supplied uniforms, arms, and armour, my veterans would handle their instruction; within a few months they would be ready for the next campaign.\nAs I finished the final preparations to depart for Kislev, a few hundred warriors sent by the Tsar arrived. They were not many, but they belonged to the Tsar's guard: men whom many of us recognised from having fought at our side against the hordes of Chaos. Their presence, therefore, was of good quality, though they lacked firearms.\nI set the instructors in order and observed the volunteers' camp: ranks of men and women ready to fight Bretonnia, adjusting the gear we had provided. With logistics moving and morale high, I boarded the train bound for Kislev; before leaving I had to attend the second ceremony, and then I would continue on to Karaz-a-Karak.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

The ceremony with Katarin was held in Kislev, officiated by the Patriarch himself. The hall was filled with venomous eyes—nobles, courtiers, and spies, each watching for their own reasons. The only pleasant conversations came from a few boyars who once again thanked me for the aid I had provided the previous year; the rest looked at me with hatred, envy, or distrust.\nEverything was kept brief. We remained in Kislev barely an hour after the ceremony; I had no intention of staying to drink from a cup that might be poisoned.\nEven so, the situation in Kislev had improved remarkably. Firearms were proving invaluable in fighting off small hordes of Chaos followers and in hunting down the vermin that still infested the region. The forests I had ordered burned months earlier no longer harbored goblins—their threat was gone. With the land cleared, Boris now focused his attention on the northern woods, where an orc tribe had entrenched itself. He was determined to wipe them out entirely.\nMeanwhile, Ungol hunting parties had spent the past few months tirelessly exterminating trolls. Everything that could be salvaged from their bodies—skin, bones, blood—was sold in the markets of Erengrad, gradually filling Kislev's coffers and strengthening its economy after the devastation wrought by Chaos.\nFor the moment, then, all was well in Kislev. With its fortresses rebuilt and armies reinforced, any Chaos host attempting to cross the border would have to face several thousand men ready to intercept them before they could multiply like the plague they are. Tsar Boris had also launched an ambitious fortification program: new strongholds were being raised along the northern passes to seal them off completely. Yet that plan demanded a colossal investment, for Kislev's mountain passes were not narrow like those of the Empire—they were wide and open, and closing them would require immense labor and resources.\nWe set out south immediately. We took the train connecting to Altdorf and from there continued toward the Dawi fortresses. We crossed Nuln and Averland swiftly, until we reached the great fortress of the Black Fire Pass. Most of the construction was already complete—only a few towers and walls remained unfinished—but the central bastion, held by some five thousand Sigmarite zealots, stood imposing and seemingly impregnable from either side. It was, without a doubt, a masterpiece of dawi engineering, capable of withstanding any invasion.\nThe entire pass system was perfectly organized: on one side, the trade route for merchant caravans; on the other, the railway line for trains. My stay there was brief. I stopped only to greet the commander—a member of the Order of the Knights of the Fiery Heart—who provided me with supplies for the campaign before we continued our journey.\nUpon reaching the Border Princes, we found the region far more chaotic than when I had last left it. Several local princes had apparently joined in a defensive coalition against the Empire, launching constant skirmishes in an attempt to disrupt our harvests. Their efforts, however, were in vain. The cities and farmlands lay several kilometers from the borders, and the once-scattered population had been relocated to the new city I had ordered built there—a place of large estates where all livestock was now concentrated.\nDespite the hostility, the mercenary armies under my employ had faithfully fulfilled their contracts. They devoted themselves entirely to defending the region, exterminating the goblin and orc tribes that still infested the valleys. Thanks to their efforts, the territory had become truly secure.\nIt was likely the only place in the entire region where no orcs or goblins remained, except for the occasional small band that descended from the south or the mountains—easily dispatched by our patrols. Many mercenaries had died, but far more had arrived, drawn by the bounties I paid for every greenskin slain and for the defense of the territory. It wasn't a problem. The garrison I left behind had successfully held the most fortified sector of the lands, enough to discourage any attempt from the coalition of princes. Their unity, after all, was as fragile as their urge to betray one another; according to several trustworthy reports, more than one of their battles had been fought among themselves. Treachery, it seemed, was their daily bread.\n\"How was the harvest here?\" I asked one of my men, who had remained behind as governor in my stead.\n\"Well… eh… the Dawi have the exact numbers, my lord. The harvest was good, though not as much as we expected. But we still have problems with the people… many of them… well, they weren't very cooperative with their work. They're nothing like the Bretonnians. We had to keep overseers watching at all times to make them work. Too many thefts… many women selling themselves… constant tavern brawls… it was hell getting this place to function. It only works because of the strong military presence—otherwise, only Sigmar himself could straighten these people out.\" The governor looked exhausted as he spoke.\n\"I see… that complicates things,\" I replied, watching the city still under construction. \"The witch hunters must be busy.\"\n\"We only have a group of five, and they're completely overwhelmed by the number of missions. I've given them all the support I can, but… Sigmar preserve us… we fix one problem only to find another. The cells are full, waiting for a judge who was supposed to arrive months ago. The Cult of Verena promised to send three new judges, but none have shown up.\" The governor wiped the sweat from his brow.\n\"Why wasn't I informed of this?\" I asked, stepping slowly to stand to his right.\n\"What? But I sent a messenger three months ago informing you my lord about the harvest and the problems, and that the railway was almost finished and only lacked the Dawi king's final authorization to enter his domains…\" the governor said, incredulous, his face quickly shifting to nervousness as he licked his lips.\n\"*Gasp* That means they killed the messenger…and the judges too... I need his name so I can notify his family,\" I said, placing the back of my hand to my mouth as I thought about what could have happened.\nThe governor closed his eyes tightly and pressed his lips together. \"Damn… I sent him to Reinsfeld to visit his family… he begged me for the chance, my lord… I… I'll give you his name immediately,\" the governor stammered, beginning to falter as he recounted everything that had happened.\n\"Shit… the road was long… where would they have intercepted him… but the real question is who,\" I said, considering all the possibilities.\nI could only think of… more than half the Empire… almost all of Kislev… the Border Princes… and, of course, all the ruinous powers—so that doesn't narrow down my possible enemies who've made a mess of this.\n\"Sergeant, take your men and return to Altdorf by train. I need you to inform the Cult of Verena that I urgently require judges for this city, and tell the Cult of Sigmar to send witch-hunters at once… and a couple more priests wouldn't hurt either, since we need permanent clergy not only the priest from the fortress at the Black Fire Pass,\" I told one of my sergeants who had been listening to the whole situation.\n\"Yes, my lord… I will carry out my duty… shall I inform the family and the widow if there is one?\" the sergeant asked, straightening as he heard my order.\n\"I entrust that to you, and please make sure they receive the pension as they should. Notify my Dawi advisers if necessary—this is a priority,\" I said, making a face at how this had developed.\nI waited until he left, and that meant I'd have to reinforce the guards along the rails. Having five thousand men watching the tracks was one thing, but if this killing of a messenger extended to sabotaging the rails… I'd be in serious trouble, since any damage could cause an accident and a day lost once the sabotage was discovered. Considering how extensive the tracks are right now, I'd have to double or triple the forces to keep them well defended.\n\"Damn… more expenses and expenses… at this rate I'll end up poorer than when I earned a hundred crowns a year in taxes after expenses,\" I cursed as I walked through the city. \"Let's hope the Dawi steel used in the parallel tracks is strong enough that, without explosives, they can't break them,\" I muttered as I paced the city.\nThe city had been built following a model similar to my Bretonnian towns, designed to construct apartment blocks to house the population and integrated into a fortification system: every street had walkways on the third floors connecting all the four-story blocks. Where a single family might once have lived, now a dozen were housed, each receiving a comparable amount of square metres of property so there would be no overcrowding. When finished, this city would be a siege nightmare: breaching the outer walls would only mean other doors in the adjacent streets would close, turning it into an attritional hell—this city already had more than twenty extra rings of security.\nFor the most part everything was still under construction: the sewer system had been built, with a water distribution network… being so close to Karaz-a-Karak, there were a lot of Dawi inventions I could access because I was trusted by the Dawi, so much Dawi technology—normally reserved as showcases of their engineering—was available in large numbers here to be tested before spending fortunes improving the construction of new cities.\nFinally, entering the city I could see a little of what the governor had described: public order was not at its best. The city centre was a boiling pot of different cultures and you could plainly see the presence of gangs; there were clearly many brothels or houses of pleasure in the area disguised as taverns, and at the first sign of soldiers most of them vanished quickly—it seemed normal, since many of my hired mercenaries clearly warned them in advance of my men's movements.\nI sighed heavily to see how my presence seemed to unpick the chaos and how everyone tried to feign innocence. \"They really do love proving those corrupt judges of Verena right, don't they? The ones who hand out death sentences for everything. Give these people a bit of freedom and they fall straight into this kind of degeneracy.\" I asked, shaking my head.\n\"Orders, my lord,\" said one of my guards, putting his hand on his sword.\n\"Put the damned city in order… coordinate with the witch-hunters and carry out a thorough purge. Fill even more the prisons if necessary; I cannot have this at my back,\" I said, turning and spreading my hands as I watched in total displeasure.\n\"At your orders, my lord… you heard him—coordinate with the local garrison and the witch-hunters. We'll bring the city to order,\" said the captain who followed me and quickly went to the city fortress to contact the guard captain.\nNot long after, I followed them up to the fortress and watched from the heights as thousands of my men began to pour into the streets, blocking many potential escape routes and closing several of the rings to trap people inside while cries rose up below.\n\"What a mess… I almost named it for Sigmar—Sigmarheim or something like that—what a disgrace it would have been to dedicate this city to the god of humanity,\" I said, watching as thousands of garrison troops began to restore order.\nI turned to see the governor, who was pale. \"I put you in charge because you had resolve,\" I said, watching him.\n\"I know, my lord… I appreciate your trust but… I need orders. These things are only your will… the witch-hunters demanded hundreds of burnings a day to put the city in order and I didn't know what to do,\" the governor said, breathing rapidly as his chest rose and fell unevenly.\n\"Do not let your hand tremble… these are not Bretonnians—some have a work ethic, some do not, but they are not like Bretonnians who live under the yoke of Bretonnian knights. If necessary, be harsh. This city is important… too important to become another Marienburg filled with chaos,\" I said, looking at him sternly.\nThe governor nodded after wiping his brow, already soaked with sweat that had reached his eyebrows.\n\"I'll take reserves from eight silos… the rest should be enough to keep the city supplied and provide the seeds needed for the harvest.\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" said the governor.\n\"Keep at it. Make sure the city is put in order. More soldiers should arrive within a few hours—use them to restore everything. I'm going to visit King Thorgrim and see if I can secure some support from the Dawi,\" I said.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I was shaking my leg nervously, my eyes fixed on the maps scattered across the table.\n\"Because I am. I thought we could use the Dawi tunnels to reach Karak Eight Peaks, but they've collapsed… and the thagoraki control them. That leaves us only one option: crossing the Badlands. Which means I'll have to leave part of my forces behind, guarding the supply posts so the logistics line doesn't break.\"\nShe stepped closer, her gloved hand resting on my shoulder.\"What about the air? We could try to enter riding griffons, or using those Dawi flying machines—the gyrocopters.\"\nI shook my head. \"We'd get trapped inside. Flying at such altitude, in freezing winds and unpredictable drafts, would be madness. And even if we did make it in, the doom divers could bring down even Dawi aircraft.\"\n\"Doom divers?\" Katarin raised an eyebrow, skeptical.\n\"Goblins. They launch themselves from catapults as living projectiles. They wear harnesses that let them glide for a few seconds… then crash into whatever they find. Suicidal, but accurate. We know there are several launch platforms inside and around the fortress.\"\nI unfolded an old map across the table. Many sections were incomplete or crossed out; no one had had a clear view of Karak Eight Peaks' interior for centuries.\n\"My sisters and I could try to calm the winds… perhaps even control the snowfall,\" Katarin said, with a half-smile that I couldn't tell was optimism or defiance.\n\"Yes, but the Dawi won't let us use their machines if we bring mages aboard. They still haven't forgotten what the elves did to them—and since we wield a similar kind of magic, that hatred touches us as well. We'll have to go in fighting. This bridge is key. And this fortress here in the mountains—Karak Drazh. The greenskins hold it. They control the pass. That's our first objective.\"\nI pointed to the mark on the map. \"An orc warlord lives there. He's harassed the Dawi for decades. King Kazador of Karak Azul has placed a bounty on his head—and on the liberation of his kin, captured by that brute. He's even attacked Barak Varr. This isn't some common warlord. And since we'll have to advance on the surface… we're already losing men just covering our rear.\"\n\"We're prepared. You have cannons, supplies, and thousands of soldiers who follow you,\" Katarin said, wrapping her arms around my neck. Her voice, warmer than usual, broke through her typical coldness. \"We'll find a way to win here. We will.\"\n\"Thank you,\" I said, letting out a sigh while taking her hand, my eyes never leaving the topographic maps. \"We can use the rivers as natural borders… if they're wide enough, maybe even navigable. I could secure riverboats from Barak Varr—or at least the orcs would avoid getting too close. The river is a good frontier, though not a perfect one.\"\nI closed my eyes, fingers interlaced with hers, breathing more steadily.The campaign was already starting with complications, but it wasn't a disaster yet. The rivers were wide and deep, their beds filled with jagged rocks. They weren't navigable—but they were nearly impossible for greenskins to cross. My vanguard riders found no usable crossings: no bridges, of course, but not even a ford.\nOnly one option remained, build one.\nThe sooner we did, the sooner I could face the reality of the situation I had walked into.\nFor the first time in years, I was commanding a campaign in a land with no roads, no bridges, no basic infrastructure. Everything an army needed to move simply didn't exist. This war would be fought in untamed wilderness, far from any zone of influence or supply.\nSo I had to improvise—or rather, to build.Thousands of my men took up pickaxes and shovels, carving paths through the scattered rocks and uneven ground. At the same time, the Dawi marching under my banner worked on the bridge's components—beams, reinforcements, anchors—all under the direction of our engineers.\n\"My lord, greenskin patrols have been sighted,\" reported one of the scouts, hurrying up to me.\n\"Where?\" I asked without looking up from the map, trying to decide the best point to place the bridge.\n\"North of the river. Likely local bands. For now, we haven't seen any larger groups trying to cross,\" said the scout.\n\"Captain, take your men. Ride to the area and clear out any threat. This site must stay secure. We can't risk our supply line.\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" the captain replied, already gathering his unit.\n\"They don't seem many, my lord. Not enough to justify moving so many troops,\" the scout added cautiously.\n\"Where there's a small band of greenskins, there are always more hiding nearby. Besides, we'll need a garrison here. Someone must protect this strategic point.\" I turned toward one of my Dawi engineers and pointed at the map.\n\"Look, we have two options. If we build the bridge to the south, it'll be faster. The river's calmer there, so we could start right away and focus on construction. But the supply line would run right through the urk routes. We'd have to leave a lot of troops behind to guard it,\" said Grimm, studying carefully the maps we had received from the High King.\n\"If we build here, the river is narrower, but the current is stronger. We'll need to make sure the structure is sturdy and reinforced. Still, it would give us the river as a natural defense. Later on… we'll have to decide where to set the second bridge.\"\n\"It's very close to the mountains… do you know if the terrain is steep or if there are hills?\" I asked with interest, watching as the Dawi began sketching on the maps spread across the table.\n\"Nothing certain. All I know dates back to when our ancestors ruled this region. Not much else. The terrain could have changed completely,\" he replied, shaking his head.\n\"Damn…\" I muttered. \"Better to deal with steep ground than fight greenskins every day. Less gunpowder wasted. We build to the east.\"I tapped the map with my finger, marking the decision.\n\"All right. What kind of fortification will we need to protect the bridge?\" asked Grimm, pulling out parchment and a metal pen to begin sketching.\n\"Nothing complicated. Something simple, wooden. A palisade—just enough for basic protection. We can't afford to build a proper fortress. Time is gold here, and we can't waste months raising walls… especially since we don't have the High King's permission. These are still Dawi ancestral lands. If we build something too permanent, they might think we mean to claim the place for ourselves,\" I said after a moment's thought.\n\"Any clan that could've claimed these lands no longer exists. I doubt it'll offend anyone… but in any case, we must move forward. We have a direct order from the High King—this shipment must reach Clan Angrund,\" replied Grimm, handing me a quick sketch of the camp layout.\nI nodded at the drawing and gave the order to begin.\nFor three days of exhausting labor, thousands of my men worked without rest—shoveling gravel, laying cobblestone roads, raising wooden structures, and above all, building the bridge needed to cross the river. Even the Dawi labored alongside them, handling the most technical tasks.\nBut in the meantime, my worst fears began to unfold.Across the river, worrying movements could be seen: large numbers of greenskins were gathering, as if preparing for something.\nThe only thing in our favor… was how stupidly impulsive they could be. Some of my soldiers fired from our side of the river, and the orcs—without thinking—threw themselves straight into the water. Yes, into the river. All muscle and no sense; the moment they hit the water, they sank and were dragged downstream, smashing against the sharp rocks until they were torn apart.\nFor now, everything was going well—skirmishes won, though at the cost of much powder. Many greenskins died in the river, either on the rocks or from my men's muskets. For the time being, the river served as a solid defense.\nWhen we finally had a sturdy bridge—small, but firm—we wasted no time. We crossed the river and began advancing toward the Dawi Karak we were meant to reinforce.\nFortunately, the terrain wasn't as rugged as I had feared. Most of it consisted of gentle hills, which made the army's advance easier, at least somewhat. Moving the supply wagons was still difficult in places, but not impossible.\nThe real problem was the greenskins in the nearby hills and mountains. They were an obstacle we couldn't avoid. Still, it was preferable to heading further south, where the orc presence was far heavier. Had we taken that route, my powder reserves would probably already be cut in half from constant skirmishes.\nAs we moved through the hilly terrain, the attacks were relentless. Bands of greenskins descended from the mountains or tried to cross the river to reach us. But here the situation was different: the river had two natural crossings, and the greenskins knew them well. They struck from those points, forcing me to leave thousands of men behind to guard the rear. At the same time, I had to assign engineers to fortify those crossings to prevent the orcs from turning the campaign into chaos.\nThe war hadn't even truly begun, and I had already left five thousand soldiers stationed in various positions, defending critical points against constant raids.\nAfter a week of marching, we reached the next obstacle: another river, deeper this time, with no natural crossing for a quick passage. We had no choice but to build another bridge. Luckily, many parts had already been prefabricated, thanks to Grimm's foresight.\nIn just two days it was assembled. It wasn't a marvel of Dawi engineering, but given our time and resources, it was a solid, functional structure—a reinforced wooden bridge strong enough to allow the main army to cross.\nI left another garrison—three thousand men—to guard the new supply route. Once again, my forces were reduced, but it was far better than being trapped. If I could break the siege, thousands of Dawi reinforcements could arrive, drastically reducing the cost of the war—especially in lives.\nOnce I finished inspecting the area, I met with Grimm again to decide our next move.\n\"Crossing the bridge, we'll need to keep heading south… the problem is that the further we go, the narrower the river becomes,\" said Grimm, pointing at the maps with the tip of his pen.\n\"That complicates things with the greenskins. How are we on powder?\" asked Katarin\n\"We've used barely a tenth of our reserves, so for now we're fine. Besides, the first shipments from the laboratory should arrive soon. We don't need to be overly cautious with expenditure… unless something happens to the supply line. But for the moment, we're all right,\" I replied calmly.\nGrimm added, tracing another route on the map: \"We could also head east, follow the river's course, then turn south. Of course, that would mean frequent contact with urk descending from the mountains. They're fewer than those in the Badlands, but far more troublesome.\"\nI took a few seconds to think. \"In that case, we continue south. Mountain greenskins are the worst—they strike from any flank, at any time. I can't keep leaving thousands of men behind just to guard our supplies.\"\nMy fingers traced the marked line of advance. It was clear there was no easy path—only less disastrous ones.\nAs we continued the march, we soon discovered a large greenskin clan settled on the opposite side of the river. They were numerous, though poorly armed—little more than sticks and hides—and for now, they hadn't noticed us. Best to ignore them. Not provoke them. At least until we were better positioned.\nI left another two thousand men garrisoned in the area, along with several cannons and organ guns. If any battle broke out, they could hold long enough to prevent the orcs from cutting off our rear.\nFinally, we reached the true beginning of the campaign: the Death Pass.There, before us, stood the great Dawi-built bridge that spanned the ravine. Once, it had been the road to Karak Eight Peaks—a masterpiece of dawi engineering, now guarded by its enemies. I could clearly see the outer walls of the ancestral fortress of Karak Drazh.\nThe gates were covered in rough iron and planks, decorated with a crude emblem—the mark of the orcs.\nWith my magic, I could feel them. Thousands of orcs inside… and something else. Skaven.\n''Well. It seemed I had arrived at just the right time''\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I assumed, as always, that it was more orcs coming down from the mountains.\n\"Looks like we've reached our first objective,\" said Bertram, doing the same as me. By now, we were used to greenskins harassing our marching columns nonstop.\nI leaned forward between the ranks to see what was happening—and then I saw it: a massive bridge.\nIt was strange. In this region there was no infrastructure at all, and the reason we'd become so good at marching through rough terrain was precisely because there were no roads or crossings. The entire journey had been a constant struggle against the wild.\n\"Well… looks like there's going to be a fight,\" I said, loading a round into my rifle.\n\"Yeah… seems like we're in for trouble with the greenskins. Best be ready,\" Bertram replied, drawing his rune blade—one of those gifted by the Dawi to our lord. Many of my comrades followed suit, unsheathing their weapons or checking their gear. It was automatic by now.\nThen something caught my eye in the sky.\"What's that?\" I asked, lifting my rifle to aim at the shapes flying above us.\n\"I don't know… eagles?\" Bertram muttered, squinting.\n\"GOBLINS!\" shouted one of the sergeants. \"Spread out! Quickly—don't bunch up! Those things are going to dive right on us!\"\nChaos erupted. We scattered immediately—some diving to the sides of the path, others taking cover behind rocks.\nDozens of figures were descending through the air. As I reloaded my rifle, I saw one of the Ice Witches step forward, her stride firm. Several of them formed a circle, their voices blending into a chilling chant, and suddenly the air itself seemed to halt.\nThen a massive gale swept down on us. The wind struck the valley with brutal force, and we watched as the flying creatures—the goblins—lost all control midair. Some smashed against the cliffs, others plummeted straight into the ground, and many vanished into the abyss below.\n\"Good! We're safe! Back to formation! Move before the… witches tire!\" the sergeant barked, glancing nervously at the Ice Witches, who were still channeling the winds with fierce intensity. Snowflakes began to fall, and the air turned bitterly cold.\nWe regrouped quickly, reforming the marching column. We started crossing the long bridge while we still could, watching as more goblins leapt from the mountains. But none got far. Kislevite magic sent them crashing helplessly into the rocks.\nEvery now and then, we looked up and saw the griffon—our lord astride it, soaring above, ready to strike at the first sign of danger.\nThe vanguard units moved swiftly. It seemed there would be no complications. In fact, it looked as though we'd cross unopposed—until we saw where the real battle would begin.\nThe bridge ahead forked, and one of the paths led straight into a fortress carved into the mountain. At its gate, a massive sculpture shaped like an orc's head made it clear who occupied it. We knew exactly why we were here.\nThe winds still howled, carrying snow and dust. We prepared for what looked like a siege. But before orders could even be given, a group of three Golden Wizards—servants of our lord—stepped forward toward the gates. They began to chant, speaking in that strange tongue only mages used.\nAll the metal holding the gates shut began to melt. Incandescent drops hissed against the stone, and the wood, no longer held in place. The fortress doors opened without a single ram.\n\"Where are the greenskins?\" Bertram asked, glancing around warily. Throughout the entire march we'd only seen goblins throwing themselves to their deaths like idiots, but a fortress… an empty fortress made no sense. It was a waste of walls.\nWe soon got the order: we were to enter.\nAnd the further we advanced, the stronger our suspicions grew.There was no one. Absolutely no one. Only piles of rusted scrap, weapon remnants, animal bones, and skulls—of all kinds. Some far too large. Others, disturbingly small.\nAt least there was light. Stones embedded in the ceiling glowed faintly, illuminating the main corridors. It made movement easier, though each step felt heavier, more uneasy.\n\"Damn… the smell's unbearable,\" I said, trying to breathe through my mouth as we passed what was clearly a mountain of excrement.\nEveryone covered their noses.\nWe advanced through the main hall in formation. Those in front carried rifles ready, some with shotguns. We cleared every corridor, every corner—but found nothing. Only empty chambers, debris, trash, bones…\n\"Georg… look at this,\" said Bertram, bending down as he prodded a corpse with his rune blade.\nI approached cautiously. The body was twisted, torn apart… and clearly not an orc or a goblin.\n\"By Sigmar… what is that?\" one of our men muttered, staring at the corpse.\nIt looked like some kind of beastman—but its head wasn't like any animal we'd seen among the Chaos breeds. This one had the face of a rat: a long snout, pointed ears, and yellowed teeth.\n\"I've heard of beastmen with the heads of stags, bulls… all sorts of things. But… a rat?\" Bertram said, nudging the body again to get a better look. The corpse was half-eaten. Clearly, the greenskins had found it before we did.\n\"How in hell did this thing end up here?\" I asked, pushing the body with the tip of my boot, my stomach churning.\n\"Only Sigmar knows…\" another soldier replied, pulling out a medallion bearing the twin-tailed comet and kissing it. \"But I'd bet it's the work of the Ruinous Powers. Only they twist men like this.\"\nI looked at the body again. It bore more deformities—elongated claws, a hunched spine, and what looked like a black, swollen pustule growing from one shoulder.\n\"Yes… it must be their doing,\" I muttered, still staring at the corpse. \"Keep clearing the area. We're not done here yet… and something tells me this isn't the worst thing we'll find.\"\nWe spent quite some time wandering through the labyrinthine fortress. We found several stairways descending to lower levels, but for now we had no orders to go down, so we focused on securing the first floor. The veterans—especially those who'd fought in Dawi strongholds before—were grateful. They knew how vital it was to secure every entrance and corridor.\nWe quickly sealed all passages leading downward, posting guards and erecting makeshift barricades. But just as we finished sweeping the last sections of the upper level, we found something unexpected—a fortress within the fortress. An inner wall.\nAnd this time, there were greenskins inside.\nNot many orcs, but swarms of goblins… and another, smaller breed I had never seen before. Still, they filled the ramparts with shrieking chaos and frenzied movement.\nThe Gold Wizards of Chamon rejoined us as we opened fire on the walls. Every shot dropped a goblin or an orc who dared peek over the parapet, while the wizards began chanting one of their strange spells again. This time, the incantation awakened the fortress's old Dawi gate mechanism. We heard the grinding of rusted gears—and then the doors began to open on their own.\nThe wizards, satisfied with their work, immediately withdrew behind the main formation.\"Forward! Take that fortress at once!\" our captain shouted.\nWe obeyed without hesitation.\nSeveral orcs came charging down from the inner walls, roaring, swinging massive axes, clad in rusted plate armor.\nI took a few steps forward, then stopped with the rest of the front line. We aimed. We waited.I saw the eyes of one of them—burning with rage.and I pulled the trigger.\nThe recoil slammed into my shoulder, the shot cracking through the tunnel—and an instant later, the echo of hundreds of rifles thundered through the fortress like a storm.\nThe orcs dropped like sacks, their bodies shredded, their armor splintered to pieces. But the rest didn't stop. They trampled their own dead, charging over mangled corpses.\nI loaded another round, shut the chamber, aimed, fired again. Another deafening echo. More bodies falling.\nThey weren't many—but they were stubborn. They advanced a few meters before collapsing, yet they kept trying. Beasts without a shred of self-preservation.\n\"Khazukan Kazakit-ha!\" the Dawi roared as they advanced between our ranks. \"Strike the urk down!\" bellowed one of their leaders as they took position at our front.\nThey closed ranks—shields forward, rune-hammers raised—and didn't interrupt our gunline. On the contrary, as we kept firing, the Dawi hurled small metal orbs toward the enemy formation. They landed among the orcs like stones—then came the roar.\nHundreds of explosions.\nThe orcs' bodies were torn apart, flying in all directions.\nWe were annihilating the greenskins. Without slowing, we advanced step by step, driving their lines back. The Dawi took the front, holding firm against the few orcs and goblins that reached our vanguard.\nThe clang of rune-forged weapons crushing bones and rending flesh filled the hall—metal on meat, shields smashing jaws, war cries drowned by the chaos of battle.\nWe fired from the second line, covering them. Then our lord appeared among us—his gromril armor gleaming amid the carnage. A hundred of his finest marched at his side.\nThey joined the Dawi at the front, crushing the greenskins still fighting. The sound of cracking skulls multiplied as our lord swung his war mace—an enormous runic weapon whose engravings blazed with power. Each blow shattered bones, broke jaws, sent orcs flying.\nIt didn't take long for the remaining greenskins to break and flee, retreating into the fortress depths.\nThe Dawi, under their commander's orders, advanced after them. Their shields locked tight, their pace slow and unyielding. Every rock, arrow, or scrap the goblins hurled from the battlements simply bounced off their rune armor, harmless.\nOur infantry followed close behind, led by our lord, marching just behind the Dawi, shouting orders to his captains and sergeants. They, in turn, barked them at us:\n\"Get to the walls! Fire on those on the ramparts!\"\nWe obeyed immediately. We shifted aim, targeting the goblins trying to hold the heights with their crooked bows. Many fell, screaming, crashing into the ground or impaling themselves on their own jagged defenses.\nThe thunder of battle grew even louder—the percussion of our rifles and shotguns mixing with the clash of steel, the Dawi war cries, and the roar of explosions.\nThe Dawi and our lord's veteran soldiers pressed deep into the fortress. We were left with the easier task—clearing the outer sections, where only scattered greenskins remained, cowards hiding rather than fighting.\n\"What's the matter, you filthy vermin?\" Bertram shouted as he impaled a goblin on his rune sword. The creature clawed at its own hands, trying to free itself from the blade buried in its gut.\nOne lunged at me with a stone knife. I smashed the butt of my rifle into its face, threw it to the ground, and crushed its neck under my boot until it cracked.\n\"Clear,\" Bertram said, flicking his sword clean of gore.\n\"Let's keep moving,\" I muttered, and we descended a stone staircase, following the echo of battle below.\nDown one of the corridors, we found a door.\n\"Damn it, it's locked,\" Bertram said, pushing against it to no avail.\n\"Let me try.\" I stepped forward, turned, and kicked hard at the rusted latch. The rotten wood gave way instantly with a splintering crack.\n\"Open,\" Bertram said, stepping in quickly with his sword raised.\nSeconds later, I heard him shout: \"Georg—get the captain!\"\n\"What happened?\" I said, entering with my rifle ready.\nBut what I saw made me freeze in place. \"By Sigmar… why are the Dawi here—as prisoners?\"\nBefore us, in a dark, damp chamber, a group of Dawi lay chained, thrown against the walls . They were wrecked—starved, filthy, covered in scars, many with wounds that hadn't healed in weeks.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

Their blows clanged harmlessly off the runic plates of my gromril armor. Around me, the few that remained were being slaughtered methodically by my men and the Ironbreakers, who never slowed, crushing each creature that still dared to breathe.\nA goblin leapt from a ledge, shrieking, a knife raised high with both hands as it hurled itself at my throat. I was faster. I caught it mid-air by the neck. A single squeeze. Crack. Its eyes—red and full of hatred—went dim at once. I let it drop like an empty sack.\nTo my right, a Dawi hurled himself forward like a projectile, smashing his helmet into an orc's jaw and sending a spray of broken tusks through the air. The brute staggered, dazed—and I gave it no time to recover. I stepped in and crushed its skull with one swing, leaving the corpse at the dwarf's feet. He met my gaze and gave a grim nod.\nI drew one of my pistols. A goblin crouched on a ledge above the hall, hoping to slip away unnoticed. Too late.\nThe pistol thundered, the shot echoing through the chamber. The creature screamed briefly before tumbling from above, bouncing off the rocks until it lay twisted and still.\nI scanned the battlefield. No real enemies left—only greenskins crawling through the blood and rubble. Some armless, others dragging mangled legs. The Dawi moved among them without mercy, ending their ancestral foes one by one.\n\"It seems we've taken control of the citadel,\" I said to the Ironbeard, commander of the Ironbreakers. Only his eyes were visible behind the runic gromril plates encasing him.\n\"Strange, umgi,\" the dwarf replied, turning slowly as he watched his warriors finish the last of the work. \"Greenskins rarely hold our ancestral fortresses with so little defense. If they were always this weak, we'd have reclaimed them centuries ago.\"\nI gestured downward several times. \"The urk are on the lower levels. That's why this place is nearly empty—they're fighting the thagoraki.\"\nThe Ironbeard tilted his head, frowning. \"How… how do you know that?\"\n\"My magic tells me. The urk are battling the raki in the deep halls. The next three levels are nearly deserted, so we'll only need to sweep them. But below that… thousands of orcs and goblins are slaughtering each other against a Skaven invasion.\"\nThe Ironbeard narrowed his eyes. \"You… and that cursed magic of yours…\" he grumbled, distrust clear in his tone. \"But if it's true, it's worth knowing. We must check the dungeons of this Karak. The kin of King Kazador of Karak Azul may yet live.\"\nI nodded. \"Yes… in fact, I can sense several Dawi down there.\" I turned toward the passage leading to the prisons.\n\"Then let's go. The High King and Kazador will want to hear this,\" said the Ironbeard, already rallying part of his troops.\nI was about to follow when one of my captains intercepted me. His breathing was ragged, his armor drenched in blood and dented from heavy fighting, his runic greatsword still dripping.\n\"My lord…\" he gasped, \"one of my men searched what looked like a cell block. We found a large group of Dawi… imprisoned.\"\nThe Ironbeard broke into a near run without another word, storming down the stone corridors as if guided by memory. We followed him to the deepest chambers of the first level. There, in a damp, dimly lit hall, we found about fifty Dawi—and what we saw froze the blood in our veins.\nThey were in appalling condition.\n\"Everyone out,\" I ordered sharply.\nMy men cleared the area in seconds, leaving only the captives and a handful of my most trusted soldiers.\n\"Bring blankets and cloaks. And keep this quiet… we won't salt the wound of their pride. They're not to be seen by the others. My men must not carry away a twisted image of the honorable Dawi,\" I told the guards, who nodded and hurried off.\nThe Ironbeard said nothing. He gripped his hammer so tightly the handle groaned under the strain. He shook his head slowly, eyes fixed on the floor.\n\"Those beasts… they'll pay for this,\" he muttered through his teeth.\n\"They will,\" I answered quietly.\nMany of the prisoners still wore rusted shackles. The sight was crushing. Some wept silently, clenching their jaws, refusing to make a sound. Others kept their heads bowed, unable to lift their gaze.\nThe worst of it was what had been done to their beards.\nSeveral had been completely shaven. Others had large patches burned or crudely hacked off. For a Dawi, it was worse than losing a limb—an outrage to their very identity, to their honor. They tried to cover their faces, shielding their bare chins with their hands the moment the shackles were removed.\nThe three women we found were in even worse condition—totally bald, stripped of every hair, their skin stretched thin over bone. Hollow-eyed, drained of strength or will—empty shells of those who had endured the unthinkable.\nThe orcs hadn't just tortured them… they had humiliated them. Stripped away what was sacred. Their pride. That wound cut deeper than any scar or burn.\nMy men returned carrying blankets, cloaks, medicine, and bandages. Alongside the Dawi warriors who had followed us, we began covering the prisoners carefully, doing what little we could to spare them further shame.\nFor long minutes, silence filled the air—broken only by the clink of chains being removed and the scrape of metal against stone. Some of the shaven dwarfs let out faint groans as they fought to keep their composure—to hold on, somehow, to the dignity they still possessed.\nThe scene was as painful as it was silent.\nUntil the Dawi commander exploded. \"We have to kill the urk right now!\" roared the Ironbeard, trembling with fury.\nI stepped toward him, trying to calm him. \"Easy—\" I began, but he cut me off, his rage slicing through the air.\n\"Easy? Look at them! Look what they did to them! And you ask me for calm? We have to kill every last urk in this cursed fortress—now!\"\nI grabbed his shoulder and met his eyes. \"The urk outnumber us. And the thagoraki too. Right now, they're tearing each other apart in the lower levels. If we wait, patience will leave us with two weakened enemies. Then, in that moment, we strike—and we kill every single greenskin.\"\nThe Ironbeard's breathing was ragged, his hammer still shaking in his hand. But he didn't look away. He just held my gaze, eyes burning with rage. \"You're right, umgi. My anger clouded my judgment… I nearly led my Dawi into a battle where we had no advantage of ground. A terrible example for the position entrusted to me by the High King,\" the dwarf muttered, breaking eye contact.\n\"Rest. I'll give the signal when the urk and thagoraki stop fighting—when they try to recover from their slaughter. That's when we strike, and take our vengeance,\" I said, clenching my fist.\nI returned slowly to my men as the cleanup began. We had taken the fortress citadel with surprising ease, taking full advantage of the internal war between the orcs and the Skaven. This was a golden opportunity—to turn this place into a secure logistics hub from which to move materials, set up camps, establish depots, and ensure a fallback point if things went wrong. The eastern gate was within reach, but advancing without securing our position would've been suicide.\nWhen I arrived, I went straight to one of the most protected chambers on the first level. It had already been cleared by the Dawi flamethrowers, who purified the place with fire. Then the space had been converted into an improvised field hospital—rows of cots, potted healing plants, and a full team of physicians trained by the Cult of Shallya, alongside Jade Magisters from the College of Ghyran we had acquired with great effort. It was one of my most expensive projects… and it was about to prove its worth.\nOne of my soldiers, face drenched in sweat, was growling through a leather strap clenched between his teeth. His arm was shattered—smashed by an orc in the thick of battle—bleeding like a broken river. Two doctors held him steady while others stitched what they could. Beside them, a Magister of Ghyran raised his hands, surrounded by watchful apprentices. Magic flowed from his fingers, and slowly, the flesh and veins of the arm began to reconnect.\nThe physicians worked tirelessly, binding and stabilizing until, finally, the arm was whole. One of them took out a small crystal vial filled with a reddish potion.\n\"This will ease the pain. Drink,\" he said, holding it close to the soldier's face.\nThe soldier reached out with his good arm, but they nudged the vial toward the newly healed one—several times. Finally, with effort, he used the restored arm to take it, raised it, and drank in one motion.\nThe doctors exchanged glances, pleased but focused, immediately moving on to less severe cases.\nBefore, in situations like this, all one could do was pray to save the arm—and if gangrene set in, cut it off and send the man home. With luck, he lived. But now, with this fusion of magic and medicine, he had a second chance—to return to the frontlines… or, if trauma won, at least continue working elsewhere, whole, instead of becoming another pension to pay—or worse, another man lost to despair.\nWe began organizing the entire first level quickly. We cleared halls full of bones, tusks, and filth, turning them into storerooms. We stacked crates of ammunition, barrels of powder, and designated dry, reinforced areas to protect the army's supplies. As more of our troops entered the safety of the fortress, the citadel became a proper base of operations.\n\"So your brilliant idea is… more armor on top of armor?\" said Katarin with a faint smile, as she conjured a massive column of ice that slowly melted into a steady stream of fresh water for our troops. She had already ordered all the Ice Witches to do the same—Skaven tactics often involved poisoning water during sieges, so at least we'd have a large reserve free of warpstone.\nI frowned as I molded steel ingots with my magic, welding extra plates over my gromril armor—reinforcements on arms, legs, and chest—creating a kind of harness covering the gromril shell.\n\"Wait and see. I can't manipulate rune-forged gromril with my magic, so I have to do this,\" I said, finishing the last adjustments.\nWhen I was done, I jumped—and before touching the ground, I hovered midair. One hand on my hip, the other on my chin, floating with confidence.\n\"Look… I can fly without my griffon,\" I said, raising an eyebrow with a ridiculously pleased grin, crossing my arms as I floated several meters above the floor.\nKatarin stared, speechless for a second before regaining composure. \"That… that's actually a good idea,\" she admitted, still astonished. Then she narrowed her eyes, folding her arms. \"But doesn't that require absurd concentration to maintain?\"\nI nodded, rising higher until I almost brushed the ceiling. \"Yes. It's not like spinning a blade or firing a shard of metal. I have to control every piece of armor at once, make sure they don't move in opposite directions… and that they don't tear me apart if I lose focus.\"\nI descended slowly.\n\"It's like keeping ten razor-sharp blades spinning around your body and hoping none of them touch you. So yes… it takes a lot of focus.\" I gave her a tired smile. \"I'll have to train until it becomes instinctive, or it'll be useless in battle. But if I can master it—it'll be invaluable.\"\nMy boots finally touched the ground. \"A cape wouldn't hurt,\" I said thoughtfully. \"I doubt it'd get caught in a gyrocopter's rotors.\"\n\"You come up with the strangest things here… especially with those 'magic classes' you're giving the Chamon and Ghyran apprentices about 'atoms and cells,'\" Katarin said, emphasizing the last words with her fingers.\n\"The less one understands magic, the more raw power it requires to use. The more one understands what they want to achieve, the easier it is to make it real,\" I said, staring at the floor.\n\"What's wrong?\" Katarin asked.\n\"You have something else to tell me,\" I said, turning to her.\n\"No… why?\" she replied.\n\"The Skaven and the orcs have stopped fighting. The orcs are returning… which means the real battle is about to begin,\" I said, walking out of the chamber.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

He was meeting with several members of his council, all busy trying to calm the growing unrest among the Imperial subjects—especially after the recent Norse raids in the north. With the Imperial fleet now anchored in Marienburg, the tribes of the north had more freedom to land along our coasts, leaving certain regions more exposed to their incursions.\nWithout saying a word at first, I handed him a letter with a broken seal. One of Albrecht's messengers had delivered it to me.\n\"Albrecht has asked for help recruiting around five thousand men. He needs guards to protect the railway lines; according to his last letter, there's been sabotage—his messengers were killed, along with a group of judges sent by the Cult of Verena,\" I said, placing the letter before him.\n\"Yes, we've already been informed,\" said one of the councillors thoughtfully.\n\"More soldiers?\" murmured one of the Imperial bureaucrats, visibly irritated. \"Your Imperial Majesty, you must set limits on that Elector Count. His power keeps growing, and no one knows what he's truly doing with that colossal army he's raised in the south.\"\nOne of the army commanders, who had clearly been waiting for that moment, joined in immediately.\"It is concerning. A noble with more troops and better equipment than the Imperial army itself is a risk. It would be prudent to reinforce our own ranks, just in case.\"\nMy father looked away, weary of hearing this same discussion for what must have been the hundredth time.\"It's already been decided that expanding the state regiments isn't in the budget this year,\" he said firmly. \"The construction of the new Imperial fleet has consumed much of our reserves. We cannot keep expanding without proper funds to equip the troops.\"\nThe treasurer seized the opportunity to speak.\"A specific tax on railway use could refill the Empire's coffers. Those lines are known to yield significant profit. A modest tribute could translate into great revenue without touching the current budget.\"\nMy father gave him a sidelong glance.\"It's under consideration. But we'll need concrete numbers on those profits first—and a careful negotiation with the Elector Count of the Westernlands.\"\nThen he forced that familiar false smile he always wore when dismissing talkative advisors.\"Leave us. It seems I have private matters to discuss with my son.\"\nThe councillors, bureaucrats, and officers filed out—especially those he trusted the least. Only his closest advisors remained.\n\"Did you know Albrecht commands nearly forty thousand mercenaries in the Border Princes, in addition to ten thousand militiamen?\" my father said, shaking his head.\n\"No…\" I replied, surprised by the numbers.\n\"Not long ago, one of our agents embedded in his forces confirmed it. Albrecht has a massive army stationed there, and we barely knew anything about it,\" my father said, covering his mouth for a moment in thought.\n\"You have spies in his army… you know that if he finds out…\" I began, watching him carefully.\n\"He'll be furious, I know. But with that much power, he makes me nervous. He commands nearly a hundred thousand men between his personal forces and his garrisons. That's a danger I cannot ignore. And that mercenary army… that revelation caught me off guard,\" my father said, glancing toward one of the Reiksguard spies.\n\"As I reported,\" said the head of the Reiksguard's spies, \"the army is currently operating as a greenskin-hunting force and aiding against the Border Princes, many of whom have grown hostile toward his presence. Initially, we feared he was raising troops to seize power—but when we saw him keep his word and march south into greenskin territory, we assumed our suspicions were misplaced. He's assisting the Dawi in reclaiming their fortresses.\"\n\"Most of my councillors and bureaucrats don't know this—and let's hope they don't find out soon. You saw it yourself: at the first chance, they were already urging me to act against Albrecht. And it's only getting worse. Many nobles resent his economic success and are waiting for me to take some measure that allows them to attack his influence through taxes or restrictive laws,\" my father said, fixing his gaze on me.\n\"That would be foolish… Albrecht has been loyal to us. To turn on him would be\"\n\"I know,\" he interrupted. \"But appearances must be maintained. Albrecht has strong ties with the Elector Counts of Middenheim and Middenland for his aid against the beastmen, with the von Mackensens, and of course, with Konstantin—who's obsessed with his smokeless powder and inventions. But beyond that circle, nearly every other noble detests him.\"\n\"I know Albrecht's a terrible diplomat and prefers to solve problems with fists rather than words, but half the Empire hating him? Isn't that a bit extreme?\" I asked, clearly surprised.\n\"The problem is, he's dismantling noble monopolies—reducing their power, even if unintentionally. Right now, he has his railway from Altdorf to Nuln, and from Nuln to Black Fire Pass in a day or two. From Altdorf to Kislev in the same span. Do you realize how much that's cut into certain nobles' incomes? They no longer collect all those bridge tolls or river transport fees.\"\n\"The revenues of some have dropped by half. Ostland's trade has declined because everything now moves by rail. The Elector Count of Talabecland—though that's partly our fault—blames Albrecht for Ostermark's autonomy. They no longer obey him and are practically under our influence now. The Countess of Averland feels the same: loss of income and unease about a military force so close to her borders. Every noble feels threatened by a railway near their lands. And as for Marienburg—no one has forgotten that. In a single day, he moved an army, took the city''\n''And the bank. Since then, many nobles have been trying to bribe me to replace the head of the State Bank. Apparently, Albrecht's trick of lending gold without interest didn't go unnoticed—and now everyone wants to be the beneficiary,\" my father said with a grimace.\nI was about to speak, but he continued.\"And then there's his trade war with the guilds. They've been quiet since we executed or hanged several of their members for their ties to Marienburg's treachery—but they've recovered. And now they're fighting back economically. This time, it's not just the guilds of Altdorf,\" my father said, turning toward his spy.\n\"Middenheim, Nuln, Altdorf, Talabheim, Salzenmund… even many of the mid-sized cities in Averland,\" explained the spy gravely. \"Their monopolies are now in open conflict with the industries of the Prince of Marienburg, who sells in massive quantities, forcing prices down and shrinking their profits. There are already private heralds urging citizens not to buy products unapproved by the guilds—a way to slow, at least slightly, the consumption of Westerlands crafts and goods. Although… some radicals are already talking about burning his warehouses.\"\nFather fell silent for a moment before replying.\"So the letter confirms this is escalating into something far more serious. Someone must have killed Albrecht's messengers. That must be investigated.\"\nAfter a brief pause, he sighed.\"For now, grant him authorization to recruit as many men as he requests. But this will be the last time. The growth of Altdorf itself has slowed because of his constant recruitment in the city.\"\nHe signed the recruitment order with a weary motion.\"Thousands have arrived, —but most are women and children, who contribute little to the economy since the men have joined Albrecht's armies. All they do is drive up housing prices and fuel public discontent. We've even had to increase our grain silos to meet the growing population's needs.\"\n\"And we should assign someone to investigate what happened to the messengers. That can't go unanswered,\" I said firmly.\n\"Indeed, my son,\" my father replied. \"If their bodies are found, perhaps a few Amethyst Magisters could learn something. But if not, there's little to be done. Still, send a Magister of the Amethyst Order with a company of guards for protection.\" He turned toward one of the Reiksguard knights, who bowed and departed to carry out the order.\n\"Now then—when do you depart south?\" Father asked with evident interest.\n\"In two weeks,\" I replied. \"I'm gathering as much smokeless powder and as many cannons from Albrecht's foundries as possible for the campaign to finish subduing the Border Princes. You should start thinking about who will receive the title over those lands afterward.\"\n\"Good. Take the hammer with you… we must take advantage of this year's agricultural prosperity to launch the campaign and secure the south. With it, nearly all our borders will be safe. Then only Sylvania and the beastmen will remain. For the first time since Sigmar's era, the Empire will have secure frontiers—Bretonnia nearly subdued, Kislev pacified, the border princes under control, greenskins destroyed, and our friendship with the Dawi stronger than ever. We will use this time to prepare for the coming storm,\" Father said, smiling.\nI was about to leave to review the lists of the Imperial army when a knight burst into the chamber, visibly shaken.\n\"Your Imperial Majesty… we have a visitor. The great Archmage Teclis requests an immediate audience,\" he announced, bowing nervously.\n\"Teclis…? Why was the Phoenix King's embassy not informed of his arrival?\" Father asked, frowning, clearly uneasy.\n\"I don't know, my emperor. He simply… appeared. He's here now.\"\n\"Very well. Let him in. At once,\" said Father. I moved to stand beside him, both of us fixing our eyes on the door.\nMoments later, Teclis entered, golden staff in hand, accompanied by a handful of proud attendants.\n\"Chosen of Sigmar,\" he said with his calm voice. \"I thank you for receiving me without notice. I trust you will forgive my lack of protocol—the nature of my visit allows no delay.\"He gave a small nod before continuing.\"I have received word that one of your vassals, Albrecht, possesses a… singular magical gift. One that, according to rumor, ties him directly to Sigmar's own sacred fire. Naturally, my curiosity was stirred. I attempted to locate him in Marienburg, but his men claimed he was in the capital.\"\nHis cold eyes fixed on my father.\"I have been unable to locate him through conventional means. Therefore, I come to you with a formal request. I wish—if the Empire allows it—to study the Count briefly. A simple, direct observation. Nothing more.\"\nFather hesitated, searching for words.\"I… I'm afraid that's not possible. The Elector Count is no longer within the Empire. He departed not long ago for a campaign in Karaz Ankor. He is not presently available for… such observation.\"\nTeclis slowly raised one eyebrow,\"A true misfortune,\" he said . \"I had hoped this inquiry might be brief, discreet, and uncomplicated. But it seems that will not be the case.\"\n\"I trust, however,\" he continued, \"that you, Chosen of Sigmar, possess more precise information regarding his whereabouts—at least a direction from which to begin my search.\"\n\"All I know is that he marched south,\" my father said cautiously. \"No detailed itinerary was shared with me.\"\n\"Karak Eight Peaks,\" I interjected, meeting the High Elf's piercing gaze. \"That's what he told me. He intends to aid in its reconquest. And, by his own words, he will not return until the campaign is complete—or until next year, if necessary.\"\nTeclis inclined his head slightly\"Then Karak Eight Peaks shall be my destination. Though I would have preferred to conduct my study in a setting less… infested with greenskins.\"\nHis gaze drifted briefly toward the window, as if calculating the journey ahead.\"I thank you for your honesty. I will seek the Count myself. Let us hope his presence is not already disturbing the delicate balance upon which this world precariously rests.\"\nThe High Elf turned and left, his golden staff echoing against the marble as his entourage followed in perfect silence.\n\"Move your plans forward, my son, and accompany him,\" said my father after a pause. \"I doubt they'll let him board one of Albrecht's trains—but if it's by Imperial decree, perhaps they'll comply. We can't afford to make the Archmage wait.\"\nI nodded and left at once, already thinking of how I might persuade him—if persuasion was even possible.\n-----------------------------\nIf there are spelling mistakes, please let me know.\nLeave a comment; support is always appreciated.\nI remind you to leave your ideas or what you would like to see.\n-------------------------------",

I'm not used to writing in English, so I apologize if there are mistakes in this message.Although, well, the huge number of Spanish-English dictionaries of R helps a lot.\nR has been feeling depressed lately. Not long ago, his girlfriend,whom he had been with since they were thirteen,broke up with him. It affected him deeply, mainly because she said she felt stuck with him. He still doesn't have a stable job since he's missing some of the legal requirements for his mandatory internship with the state, which he needs in order to become a lawyer. That situation made her decide to leave.\nAll this happened around the same time EU5 came out, and he's been isolating himself, playing the game while trying to cope. I'm afraid there won't be any new chapters for quite a while. R seems to be working on two different stories now—one inspired by EU5 about life in the medieval era, and another one based on our Warhammer 40k project, which involves a lot of my research. It looks like he's already started writing both.\nThey're written in Spanish, so I guess they're more personal projects. And, of course, he'll probably finish them—writing usually helps him get through his depression. I went to visit him today since he had been making all kinds of excuses not to meet up.\nI hope you all understand—those of you who enjoyed his previous story—but it's likely he'll set it aside for now, as he's focused on these new projects,and there's little I can do to convince him to do anything since he seems devastated.",

Luckily, the jeweler was understanding and since I was still within the deadline, I managed to return the rings, so at least that part wasn't too terrible.\nThe problem is that I'm having writer's block with this story. Every time I try to write something, memories of my girlfriend hit me and I end up dropping everything after just a few words. It's happened several times already; I've tried to pick the story back up, but I just can't.\nMy friend tells me I should relax, and that in the meantime I should upload one of my personal projects—he already approved them and promised to help me with the research.\nAs you know, my biggest weakness is writing the beginnings of stories. I think I managed to create a halfway decent opening this time (normally my personal projects don't even have that part because I'm terrible at writing introductions). The thing is, since I won't be continuing this story for a few months but still want to give something to the people who enjoy my writing, I have three projects saved that I could polish, translate into English, and upload in a few days.\nSo my question is: which one would you like to see?\nI have one about a person from our time who reincarnates as Basileus Makedon, the \"peasant emperor.\" I started this one when Europa Universalis 5 came out, so it's heavily inspired by historical accuracy. It focuses more on business, intrigue, and betrayals in the Byzantine court.\nAnother one is a reincarnation as a commoner in the Margraviate of Brandenburg a few decades before the Baltic Crusades. Like the previous one, this one leans heavily into commerce and social ascent while searching for land in the region.\nAnd the third is the Warhammer 40K project I'm working on with my friend, where we combine the story with StarCraft 2, sending the Terran Dominion—either just one character, or a small war fleet into the 40K universe.\nI'll leave the choice up to you, and I want to apologize for not being able to continue. I'm truly blocked right now and can't get anything done, and the only time I can write is when I switch to other stories.",

His main motivation was avenging the old Emperor after the betrayal of his son.

Still, it's likely I'll mess up plenty of things.\nThe second option is waiting and going for the Byzantine Empire storyline once I have a better grasp of the historical background, while we research books and get proper material to study everything carefully.\nIf you choose the Byzantine option, I'm planning to make something shorter, around 120–150 chapters. I want to show the brutal living conditions of the era, as well as how the MC slowly becomes corrupted by the Byzantine system.\nIf you still prefer to go with Warhammer 40k, my idea is that they arrive around M38, during the Tau Second Sphere Expansion, making the Tau their main enemy. I like that setup because in a way they're balanced: the Tau have the numbers and the Terrans have superior technology, and I want to show how both sides tear each other apart—unless someone recommends something better.
