      "content": "Leonel barreled down a set of spiraling stairs. With a leap, he cleared the railing, foregoing the last of the steps to land in a living room. Jumping over a couch, he rounded a corner into the kitchen to snatch a bottle of foul green liquid.\n\"Thanks for the daily dose of cow shit, dad. Really appreciate it.\"\nA middle-aged man looked up from his tablet, pushing his glasses up with a couple fingers. He was lounging behind the large glass doors that opened from the living room into the backyard when his son's usual defamatory statements entered his ears.\n\"In another rush toward failure?\"\n\"I'll succeed this time!\"\nInstead of launching himself out the front door, Leonel actually made his way back up the set of spiraled stairs.\n\"That's what you said the last over hundred times.\"\nLeonel didn't wait for his father's next sarcastic statement. He pushed opened the attic doors and swung himself out of the three-story high triangular windows. His actions looked no different from an attempt at suicide, but his hand just barely caught the ledge, swinging himself upward to latch onto a weakening water drainage pipe.\nLike a spry monkey, the plastic lid connector of his bottle hanging from his teeth, he climbed to the roof, landing on the angled tiles with a practiced ease.\n[Subject: Leonel Morales]\n[Infraction Code 118.67.2 - Unauthorized scaling of a residential building. Under the Parkour and Freerunning Act of 2034, this is classified as a Type 1 Misdemeanor]\n[It is advised that subject Leonel Morales immediately cease illegal activity to avoid charges]\nLeonel ignored the beeping female voice emitting from his wrist, his eyes having locked onto his next target.\nThe suburb Leonel and his father lived in was decently well off and could be considered a part of the upper middle class. However, the location of their home could only be described as odd. Or, rather, the entire suburb community was out of expectations.\nThe community existed on a large flying platform that orbited a main city below like the Moon did the Earth. These so-called Floating Paradises acted as a solution to the housing crisis of 2066, effectively fixing the problem by creating more surface area for housing.\nNowadays, only the obscenely wealthy could live on the surface. Leonel's destination happened to be this lofty surface world. Though, while most who lived on these Floating Paradises could only catch a glimpse from time to time, Leonel traveled down almost everyday.\n'… 17 seconds.'\nLeonel crouched on his home's roof. His and his father's home happened to be at the very edge of the Floating Paradise. Of course, there were several safety measures taken. But, that wouldn't stop Leonel.\nDespite his vantage point, he couldn't see the backyard his father had been sitting in. In fact, his home looked completely empty from the outside due to a privacy setting.\nHe swung his head back, taking a big swing of his dad's green concoction. In that moment, not only did his tongue seemingly light on fire, but even his lungs burned. One would think he was breathing in a raging fire's smoke instead of drinking a smoothie.\n\"Agh… Really outdid yourself this time, old man.\"\nLeonel suddenly took a leap. At first, it seemed that he wouldn't make it very far. He'd fall three stories and come out with a broken leg if he was lucky.\nHowever, that was when a sudden gust of wind crashed into his body. If it wasn't for its sturdy straps, the backpack to his back would have been flung off entirely.\nA fierce WHOOSH filled Leonel's ears as he was taken into the skies.\nHis arms and legs spread out, a refreshing smile playing his features as though he didn't realize that he looked no different from a madman to any sane observer.\nHe was a lone man above the clouds, free falling without a care in the world. His clothes whipped against his own body, revealing a hidden toned torso.\nWhen it seemed that Leonel would be falling hundreds of meters to the surface below, his body tucked and rolled, bursting through a layer of white clouds that spritzed a refreshing dew across his face. His last bit of fatigue vanished without a thought.\nWith a dull thump, he rolled across the hard ground. It only took a moment to realize that this wasn't in fact the ground at all, but rather the very top of a sky scraper that seemed to hold up the clouds.\n\"Perfect score.\" Leonel grinned, praising himself.\n[Infraction Code 213.13.1 - Unauthorized entry to the surface. Under the Sky Island Act of 2071, this is classified as a Type 7 Felony]\n[Subject Leonel Morales, 17, has been targeted for capture. It is advised that subject remain where they are to avoid added charges]\n[Subject classified as a minor. Guardian Velasco Morales has been contacted]\n[Error. Communication failure. Attempting reboot]\nLeonel's grin widened. Having a retired Tier 5 government official as a father had its perks. For example, any crimes linked to a retiree of such prestige was directly handled by the Bureau of Intelligence and Protection, or BIP for short.\nSince Leonel was a minor, all of his crimes were forwarded to his father to be vetted by BIP. With his father's name at his back, small crimes like this were directly ignored. Unfortunately, though, his eighteenth birthday was coming up soon.\nLeonel popped up, grabbing a silver framed bicycle hidden in a corner. He leapt from the building's side, swinging his bike's seat between his legs just as he firmly landed on a cylindrical glass structure attached to the side of the skyscraper.\nDue to the suffocating lack of space and the obscene price per square footage, almost every building on the surface was interconnected in some way. The skies were filled with glass tunnels, towering structures were sometimes no more than a meter or two apart, and personal vehicles were incredibly rare even for the rich who could afford to live here.\n\"Get to school the normal way, boy!\"\nLeonel's laughter rang out as though there wasn't a several hundred meter drop beneath him.\n\"Screw off, Lenny. I'll start taking the tube the moment you agree to pay those ridiculous fees for me.\"\n\"My name isn't Lenny!\"\nLeonel pedaled away to duck away from the old man's next round of nagging. He still didn't know how the old man always managed to know when he arrived and also had no idea where his voice was being projected from either, but he could only assume that he was sulking behind one of those one-way viewing windows.\nStreaking across the high rises of the surface city, Leonel sped through the dense metal forest far faster than many thought possible. Eventually, the tall skyscrapers began to shorten and Leonel had no choice but to change his tactics lest he get caught by some busybodies.\nFinding his usual back alley, he dropped three or so meters as a time, hopping his bike from glass tunnel to balcony to light post before eventually landing on the ground.\nHe took his backpack from his back, pulling out a pair of grey slacks, a recently pressed white shirt, and a navy blue blazer.\nHe quickly stripped himself of his sports wear. After leaning a mirror the size of a piece of paper again a large garbage disposal bin, he slicked his hair back with his accumulated sweat.\n\"Refresh.\"\nA UV light swept over Leonel's body. In a flash, his accumulating body odor was killed off, replaced by a neutral, refreshing scent.\nIn a moment, he had put on his grey pleated pants, buttoned up his shirt, and slid on his blue blazer. After putting on his bag, he stood up to his full height of 6'3\".\nHe smiled toward his propped up mirror. It wasn't because he was overly satisfied with his own appearance, though he could be considered to be quite handsome. Rather, he was testing to see which smile came off the most charming.\nHis skin was a tanned bronze, his short hair swept freely in the wind with its dirty blond almost amber color, and his eyes were a pale green.\nLeonel was not only tall and toned, but his frame was both lean and well-built. Despite this, he had a kind and inviting disposition. His presence made others feel comfortable.\nIn truth, if others knew he was practicing his smile, they'd think he was crazy. He was more than charming enough, was there a need to practice anymore?\nSurprisingly, almost an hour ticked by before Leonel's watch beeped once more. Realizing he would be running late if he wasted anymore time, he hopped on his bike. But, his pace was much slower this time, not wanting to ruin his effort by sweating once more.\nHe didn't have long to go. The streets leading to his school were nothing like the congested communities he had passed through before. It was like entering a whole new world.\nThere was greenery all around, ancient trees vibrantly recovering from the winter months, and winding paths that led to beautiful architectural feats.\nThis place was the third ranked academy on Earth, a prestigious place only for the elites of the younger generation — Royal Blue Academy.\n\"Leo!\"\n\"Good luck!\"\n\"We have bets on you succeeding this time!\"\nLeonel grinned as he passed by a few groups of students preparing to head to their classes, waving in acknowledgment.\nSoon, Leonel's gaze landed on a massive dome-like building. It stretched hundreds of meters in every direction and had several entrances just from the front.\nEven among Royal Blue Academy students, there were different separations. To be able to step into this building, only the highest ranked seniors could do so.\nHowever, even with such a masterpiece before him, Leonel's view was completely filled with the sight of just one young lady standing near the top of a wide set of white marble stairs.\nShe looked like a dainty fairy descended from the skies. Her long, flowing black hair gently waved in the wind, only resting at the small of her back every so often. Her eyes were a warm amber that bordered on gold, making her seem like a goddess separated from the world.\nA small group of friends stood around her. Their banter caused her to smile a shy smile that gripped Leonel's heart and refused to let go.\nWhen she looked up and met Leonel's gaze, he felt that the entire world aside from her had turned various shades of white.\nHer delicate tanned yet fair skin, the small slope of her nose, the way the wind gently caressed her thigh-length dress, revealing the curves she so modestly hid.\nThough not an inch over 5'7\", she had a presence that captivated the world, one larger than even Leonel himself believed he had.\nThe young fairy blushed profusely when she saw that it was Leonel, a crimson tide waded from her slender collarbone and up her neck, coating her soft cheeks.\n\"Aina…\" Leonel's voice was powerful and filled with emotion as though this was the very first time he was doing this.\n\"Ah, he's here again.\" One of Aina's friends teased.\n\"Stop enabling him.\" A fiercer friend rebutted. \"Poor Aina has been getting harassed to death by him for the last four years. Get lost!\"\nLeonel seemed used to this good-cop, bad-cop routine. But the truth was he couldn't even see or hear them. His senses were incomparably focused.\n\"I won't stop until I have a real answer from you.\" Leonel's gaze burned. In that moment, his pale green eyes seemed to gain a new light, becoming a green more vibrant than even the trees around him. \"I must be your man. Will you have me?\"\nThe surrounding students all simultaneously stopped as though collectively holding their breaths.\nAina's cheeks grew several shades of red darker, almost becoming as ripe as a tomato. Her small lips trembled before she turned and ran up the steps, disappearing into the Academy halls.\nLeonel gained another glare from Aina's fierce friend before she and the much kinder young lady rushed after the embarrassed Aina.\nIn the end, Leonel could only sigh. Seemed that today was yet another failure.",

      "content": "Leonel's depressed mood didn't last for long. Soon we was smiling as though nothing had happened.\nAt that moment, an arm wrapped around his shoulders. Considering how easily the culprit had done so, it was obvious that he was even taller than Leonel.\n\"Another failure, how many is that already? 520?\"\n\"521.\" Leonel muttered.\n\"Almost every school day since first-year, huh?\"\nThe culprit laughed, leading Leonel up the stairs.\n\"There are too many young noble women looking to get into the good books of the 3021st bachelor of the Eligible Minor list. Yet you've been solely focused on one girl for four years, think of all the hearts breaking across the world.\"\nLeonel laughed. \"James, when you have to say such a large number, it makes the accomplish ring hollow, don't you think?\"\nIt was quite funny. It was nice to be ranked, but being told that there were 3020 men better than him didn't exactly have a nice ring to it. Plus, this was just the Eligible Minor list, once he turned 18, he might not rank on the true Eligible Bachelor list at all.\nMore depressing than that was the fact there were several snotty-nosed brats no more than 13 or 14 years old ranked ahead of him.\n\"Bah, forget that damned list.\" James spat. \"Who knows what perverted grandma ranked a bunch of minors on their eligibility? Load of nonsense.\"\n\"Must be nice looking down from on high like that, Mr. 1034th.\"\nJames laughed pervertedly, shaking Leonel side to side with his arm.\n[Scanning… Security procedures underway]\n[Student Leonel Morales recognized]\n[Welcome future Five-Star Quarterback]\nLeonel heard the usual mechanical voice ringing in his ears. Though he knew no one else could hear it, he still felt a deep disgust whenever he heard this introduction.\n\"Think about it this way,\" James continued as they entered the grand hallways of Royal Blue Academy, \"There are over three billion people on Earth who are under 18. Half of those are men like us. Yet were in the top percent of a percent of a percent of them.\n\"You gotta stop chasing after this one girl. There are too many who want you.\"\n\"As long as she rejects me, I will leave her alone. But in four years, she's never said a word after one of my confessions. She always just runs off.\" Leonel swiped his finger under his nose a few times. \"It's obvious she likes me.\"\nJames was stunned for a moment before bursting into another fit of laughter. It seemed the students were used to his boisterousness because no one batted an eye to his ridiculous laugh.\n\"I don't know why I waste my words, I know you don't care about these surface things. I should have known nothing would affect your state of mind for the big game.\"\nJames pulled his arm from Leonel's shoulder, pounding a fist to the latter's chest.\n\"Those preppy boys can just wait patiently for their fourth National Championship loss in a row.\" Leonel grinned, pounding James' chest in return.\nLeonel caught a bit of a complex light in his best friend's gaze. James was easily three inches taller than him and had been his partner in crime ever since they entered Royal Blue Junior Academy together. Leonel would never miss something like this, he knew him too well.\n\"I do have something to talk to you about —.\"\nJames' voice was cut off by the ring.\n\"— Dammit, there's a test today!\"\nLeonel shook his head as James ran away like a madman, likely trying to find someone he could cheat off of. Without thinking much, he pulled out a binder from his backpack to cram for his own test while he walked to class.\nUnfortunately, he and James weren't in the same class. While Leonel ranked third academically across all subjects, James was near the bottom of the barrel. If it wasn't for the fact his Gene Analysis decided that his fateful career was that of a 'Five-Star Tight End', he wouldn't be allowed to enter this building at all.\nRoyal Blue Academy took these separations very seriously. Due to this, it was already a miracle that Leonel could make it into Senior Class A to begin with.\nWhen Leonel was young, like every other child at the age of three, he took a mandatory Genetic Analysis Examination. Among other things, this test was meant to decide your optimal career path while weighing your benefit to society. This career path would be graded from one to five stars depending on several factors.\nUltimately, a One Star Professional was average. This person wouldn't cause any waves in their career path, but they would be able to stabilize its foundation, allowing the innovators at higher star evaluations to drive progress.\nFive Star Professionals were on another level. These were people that would revolutionize their fields. In a single generation, there wouldn't be more than a hundred children with this level of evaluation, and not every profession was guaranteed to birth one either.\nIt should have been great that Leonel had such an evaluation. He too was a Five Star Professional. The trouble was that he had no interest in joining the National American Football League and becoming a Hall of Fame Quarterback.\nPeople like him were categorized as 'entertainers'. He would be rich and live a great life, but he would never be taken seriously outside of his sport. This was part of the reason he was ranked so lowly on the Eligible Minor list. Many ranked above him were only worth three stars to their professions, but they were still more valued.\nOf course, this wasn't the full reason or else James wouldn't be ranked so much higher than he was since he too was an 'entertainer'.\nLeonel walked into class just on time. He smiled lightly to greet a few people before burying his head back into his binder of notes.\nThough many liked to socialize with Leonel, they could only shake their heads when they noticed their school's star quarterback cramming as he usually did. His personality was really too odd. He had just been confessing his undying love to Aina, yet now he sat right behind her in class as though he didn't know who she was.\nAt the same time, the shy Aina who blushed whenever she saw Leonel on the steps hardly reacted to his entry into the class either. Could this fated couple be bipolar?\nSince those in Senior Class A didn't even total 20, they could be considered quite close knit. They had become quite invested in the Leonel-Aina romance. Unfortunately, the two gave them no food for the soul in class.\n\"Alright, all books away. The test will start now.\"\nThe seemingly normal desks surfaces flickered and became screens. They were designed to block light projection in every direction but the test-taker's own perspective. So, cheating was effectively impossible.\nLeonel's amiable gaze completely vanished. It was like he entered a battlefield as the class was filled with his suffocating presence.\nBy now, the others of Senior Class A had become used to it. After all, they had journeyed up with Leonel from Freshman Class A. But it would be a lie to say they didn't still break out into a cold sweat every time.\nIt was just a test, was there a need to take it so seriously? They really couldn't understand how Leonel was evaluated as a Five-Star Quarterback instead of a Five-Star General. Even if he was evaluated as a Four-Star General like his father, it would have been a much better use of his talents.\nAs usual, Leonel finished with blazing speed, only taking half an hour to complete a two-hour test. Without a choice, he pushed up from his desk, grabbing his bag and slinging it over his shoulder.\nThe rest of the class breathed a sigh of relief. Now they could start taking the test on their own.\n\"Sorry, teach. I gotta go.\"\n\"Don't worry about it, Leo.\" Ms. Deen, an amiable lady getting on in years, smiled lightly. She was quite fond of this young one. \"I know you athletes have a lot on your plate. Go on now.\"\nLeonel was about to jog out of the classroom door when he suddenly thought of something and paused. He looked up to the ceiling and muttered something as though he was gathering strength. With a grit of his teeth, he turned back.\nWith purposeful steps, he made his way back to Aina who was still focusing on her exam. His finger tapped the metallic watch on her small wrist before she could react. There was a light glow that signaled from his watch to hers.\nShe sat in a daze for a moment before she looked up and realized it was Leonel. For a moment, she didn't know how to react.\n\"I know you probably won't go, but I thought I would try anyway.\" Leonel smiled lightly. His disarming smile seemed to warm the air. \"We can celebrate our win tonight together.\"\nWithout another word to Aina, Leonel turned and jogged away. Pressing his hands in apology to Ms. Deen for his disruption, he left with an embarrassed smile.\nLeonel sprinted out of the building, hopping onto his bike to cut across campus with blazing speed.\nUnfortunately, this was the true reason he could only rank third. He never had the time to listen to lectures. With the Information Restriction Act of 2072, knowledge was restricted the further away from the surface world you were.\nThe government's reasoning was that policing Floating Paradises was difficult, especially the poorest regions that existed the highest in the sky. So, it was impossible to monitor how this 'sensitive' knowledge was being used. Therefore, the government concluded that it should be restricted.\nHowever, when had the reasons governments gave for doing things ever not been bullshit? Even the official reason they gave was so terrible.\nIn the end, the only time Leonel had to study was the time he spent on the surface world. Otherwise, this oh-so 'useful' watch on his wrist watch would censor his textbooks.\nStill, this wasn't the worst of what Leonel had to deal with. In order to enter one of the top three Academies' main campuses, there were extremely strict requirements. One had to be a Three-Star Professional in what were known as the 'Essential Professions', things like engineers or surgeons, or a Four-Star Professional in an 'Auxiliary Profession', careers such as lawyers or business men.\nIf one wanted to enter the main campus with an 'Expendable Profession' like Leonel's, Five-Star was the minimum.\nWhat did all of this mean? It meant that Leonel was only allowed to enter the same building as Aina based on his credentials as a star quarterback. He had no choice but to follow the athlete recruit's curriculum which was obviously not academically centered.\nJames' so-called 'test' this morning was only for the basic knowledge every adult should have. Over 80% of his workload was actually evaluated at Royal Blue Academy's state-of-the-art athletic facilities.\nThe logic was sound. Since his career path had already been decided as a muscle-brained jock, what did he need physics, maths and literature for?\nLeonel sped into a massive glass-panned oval-shaped arena. After entering the locker room, he was greeted by the moans of dozens of grown men.\nPinching the bridge of his nose, he sighed like a disappointed parent.\n\"\"Captain!\"\"\n\"You're all too embarrassing, I don't want to be your captain anymore.\"\n\"Don't be like that, cap. These Four-Star Masseuses have the hands of angels!\"\n\"Come on cap, you gotta try this. They only hire these goddesses for the National Championship game. If you don't take advantage now, you'll have to wait until you get drafted by the NAFL!\"\n\"Well, since you're all so sincerely begging me…\"\nSoon, Leonel's own moans filled the locker room.\nAn eruption of boisterous laughter shook the arena's walls. It didn't seem that the biggest game of the year was just a few hours away at all. And why would it? Leonel had led them to victory three times before already, this year would be no different.",

      "content": "[Don't worry for those who don't understand most of what happens in this chapter. I know American Football isn't exactly an international sport. Rest easy, this is the only chapter the sport will have relevance in :) ]\n\"Good evening gentleman, I hope we can have a good game today. Everyone knows the stakes, so play free and play safe. Stay within the rules as we don't have to have a problem.\"\nThe crowd was deafening. The thumping of feet, the boisterous chants, the heated anticipation boiled in the air, shaking the very stadium they stood within.\nThe Royal Blue Academy's Royal Stadium sat within a massive glass structure formed of curved triangular panels. It danced with the setting sun beautifully, capturing dark reds and oranges that played across its reflective surfaces.\nThe green, white-striped football fields were completely empty with the exception of 11 men who stood on the 50-yard line facing one another. Clicking and flashing cameras sounded, trying to capture every moment.\nLeonel stood proudly, two of his teammates to either of his sides. He calmly smiled at the arrogant sneers of his long time opponents from Angel Wing Academy, his helmet tucked under his arm.\nHis football pads and jersey fit on like a knight's armor, glistening a beautiful deep blue. The only exception was the number on his chest which stood out as a bright white. The number 3.\n\"Here is the coin we will be flipping today.\" The Head Referee continued to speak, stretching out a beautifully designed coin that was about half the width of his palm. \"On one side we have a football decorated with the flag of the fallen American Empire. This will be tails.\n\"On this side we have the Paradise Palace. It will be heads.\n\"This coin was designed by a Four-Star Metal Worker. It was given the name 'Uniting'. It represents our Ascension Empire's ability to ingratiate all of its past conquests, leaving a place for all.\"\nThe Head Referee allowed the ten players to see both sides.\n\"Are you prepared to lose?\"\nA gaze filled with confidence bore down on Leonel. The culprit was a young man with long flowing blond hair. His white jersey was almost blinding under the lights, making one have to squint just to maintain eye contact.\nThis young man was a Four-Star Quarterback prospect, Conrad Siegfried.\n\"The result will be just the same as it's always been.\" Leonel replied faintly.\n\"You know the drill. Royal Blue, you're the home team. Call it in the air.\"\nThe Head Referee tossed the coin into the air.\nTime seemed to slow to a crawl. The piercing gazes of two young men met across space, a spinning coin falling slowly between them.\n\"Tails.\"\nThe coin landed with a soft thud on the grass below.\n\"The result is Tails. Royal Blue, would you like to receive or kick?\"\nLeonel grinned as though the answer was obvious.\n\"We receive.\"\n\"Angel Wing, pick the direction you'd like to kickoff from.\"\nConrad casually pointed. He hadn't let Leonel's comments bother him. If it wasn't for Leonel's birth, it would be him who would be the best of this generation. Others would let this fact crush them, but it filled Conrad with a burning desire to win by any means.\nLeonel turned, heading back to the sidelines. He grabbed his helmet's face mask, sliding it onto his head like a knight's helm.\nIn that moment, his aura completely changed. A violent pressure suffocated the Royal Blue sidelines as almost a hundred pairs of gazes landed on Leonel's dark, tinted visor.\nSoon, the entire stadium fell into an eerie quiet as Leonel met each one of their gazes head on.\n\"Respect the game. Persist to the end.\" Was all Leonel said.\n\"Respect the game. Persist to the end.\"\nRoyal Blue repeated these words as one. The crowd joined in, a torrent of momentum climbing to infinity.\nA rush of emotion filled the air, a wild cheering shaking the very ground once more.\n\"Let's go.\"\n[And here we go again. The fourth year and the fourth National Championship appearance for Five-Star Quarterback Leonel Morales and his Royal Blues. Will it be another victory? Or with the star quarterback end his tenure with the only blemish on his resume?]\n[I think we all know the answer to that, Phil. In case you've all forgotten, let me remind you. This is THE greatest quarterback prospect to ever be birthed. This young man was throwing darts in his diapers. He could sleepwalk through this game and still win by 30]\n[Don't think we don't know what you're doing, Rick. You're just hoping your Los Angeles Sewer Rats trade up to pick him in the 2198 draft. Well let me break it to you. We have the number one overall pick this year!]\nThe entertaining commentary of the Phil-Rick duo was in full swing, the liveliness was intoxicating.\n[And here it is! The kickoff of the 119th National Championship Game!]\nAngel Wing's kicker did a light jog up before unleashing a booming kick that soared through the air, landing out of the back of the end zone for a touch back.\nWith that, the game had truly begun.\n[Here we go, the first play]\n[It seems that Coach Owen is really letting Morales have full reign now. Immediately entering a five wide set, not even using a running back]\n[Ha! Morales is all the running back they need]\nLeonel shifted his gaze from left to right, checking the defense. He could see the vicious gazes of the Angel Wing defensive line. Their middle linebackers gaze locked onto Leonel's. He was a Four-Star Professional in his Junior year. Unfortunately, much like his quarterback, he had been played to death by Leonel for the last two years.\nHis eyes swiftly met James' as though in tacit agreement.\n\"Blue 80. BLUE 80. Set. Hut!\"\nLeonel clapped his hands, his leg slowly raising and setting into position as he accepted the snapped ball.\nHe glided backward effortlessly. His back leg had hardly planted before he cocked his arm back and released a laser.\n[A corner blitz!]\n[Morales didn't check the play, he actually threw it directly over the corner's head!]\n[James dropped the ball?! That could have been a 20-yard gain! How unlike him]\n[Hey…!]\nThe loud blowing of a whistle sounded.\n\"Unnecessary roughness. Roughing the passer. Number 21. 15-yard penalty, first down.\"\nLeonel felt that the wind had been knocked out of him. Having opened up his chest to throw the ball, he had been completely blindsided by the blitzing corner. Of course, he had known it was coming, but he couldn't throw and dodge at the same time.\n\"Gonna be a long night, pretty boy.\" Number 21 grinned down at Leonel just as another whistle blew.\n\"Unsportsmanlike conduct. Number 21. 15-yard penalty, first down.\"\nThe corner raised his hands in mock defeat, swaggering back to his side of the field.\n\"You good, cap?\"\nOne of Leonel's offensive lineman helped him up.\n\"No problem.\" Leonel said with a cold smile.\nThe team huddled in.\n\"Sorry Leo, you took a hit for no reason.\" James' gaze was filled with shame.\n\"Don't worry about it, it happens.\" Leo hit his shoulder pads. \"Head up. Didn't we just gain a free 30-yards anyway?\n\"Since they wanna play games, let's play games. The play goes — Trips right, red under seam, wide out bang. On two, on two. Break!\"\nThe huddle broke, leaving Leonel to jog to the line.\nHe paused in shotgun, waiting for his team to get set. Usually, he would scan the defense. But this time, his head turned to the right, his gaze piercing toward just one side of the field.\nHe raised a finger pointing at number 21. He had never seen this player before, so he must have been a freshman. Considering his cockiness, he was most definitely at least a Four-Star recruit. It seemed Leonel would have to teach him to be more obedient.\n[Ooooo! He's done it now]\n\"Blue 21. BLUE 21. Down set. Hut. HUT!\"\nThe whistle blew.\n\"Offside. Number 21. Five-yard penalty, first down.\"\n[He's toying with the rookie now. You think the little guy thought Leonel would just try to force the ball toward his side of the field? He's too naive. Football is a game of the mind]\n[Excellent use of the hard count to deal with an overaggressive rusher. What is Angel Wing thinking sending a corner blitz twice in a row?]\n[From now on, Morales is in control!]\nAnd in control he was. The first drive was no less than a masterclass in timing, accuracy and precision. In just 12 plays and 7:36 minutes, the Royal Blues found the end zone.\n[Even with his star tight end having two dropped passes, Morales finds pay dirt, stacking one touchdown to the stat sheet]\nThe game became a back and forth affair. Though Royal Blue had Leonel and James, not only did James seem to be having a bad game, but Angel Wing had far more Four-Star recruits than they did. Aside from the dynamic duo, Royal Blue was mostly constructed of Three-Star prospects. After all, they were only ranked third of the Academies while Angel Wing was ranked second.\nHowever, Leonel pulled the team from the depths of despair time and time again.\n[What a bullet over the middle!]\n[Morales is really carrying the load of the offense, but he's taken a lot of hits this game. You have to wonder if it's worth it, he has nothing left to prove at this level of football]\n[That's just part of his charm. Would he really be Leonel Morales if he pulled himself out of this game?]\nTime ticked and the fourth quarter came around, a score of 35-31 in favor of the Angel Wings hanging on the scoreboard.\n\"What the hell are you doing out there, Bennett?!\" Coach Owen grabbed James' chest pads, fury billowing through his thick mustache. \"You choose the biggest game of the year to shit the bed?!\"\nJames' head hung low.\n\"I get it.\" Coach Owen took a step back. \"You've already won three times, this game is probably meaningless to you already. But think of your juniors. This may very well be their only opportunity in their lifetimes.\"\n\"Coach, that's…\" James wanted to defend himself, his gaze flickering with a complex light.\nHe simply couldn't find the courage to do so. He already had five dropped passes this game alone. That may be as many as his whole academy career from the start to now. He really was playing out of character.\nLeonel came over with a smile. In truth, if one ignored the happy expression on his face, it would be easy to see the kind of sorry state he was in. He had already been forced to tape up his ribs at half time after yet another late hit.\n\"Come on coach, you know he'll step up when it really counts. If we didn't keep this game a bit close, wouldn't the crowd be too bored?\"\nThe sound of a whistle came from the field. The Angel Wings kicked off, leaving the ball in their possession for a final drive, 1:15 sitting on the clock.\n\"Isn't this what we live for?\" Leonel's grin sent a wave of calm through the sidelines. \"Let's go win this.\"\nLeonel slid on his helmet. Like a general leading his army, he stepped out onto the field, his mind incomparably focused.\n[And here we go. Scoot up to the edge of your seats everyone, this is the final drive to decide it all!]\n[A nice and easy run on first down. It's clear the Royal Blues are taking their time, settling the pace, looking to end it on their own terms]\n[Excellent timing on that out route. 87's been a key piece with Bennett's down game. He may only be a Three Star prospect, but he's stepped up big today]\n[0:47 on the clock and the Royal Blues are already at midfield. Morales has them running like a finely tuned engine]\n[Oh no! 56 whiffs on a block, letting a rusher free!]\n[Morales spins out of the tackle, rushing to his right]\n[A work of art, nothing less! A slight flick of the wrist to send the flying 40-yards right between the numbers]\n[87 tip toes out of bounds at the opponent's 6!]\n[0:03 on the clock, my blood is boiling! Can they do it, can they seal their dynasty with a victory?!]\n\"This is it boys, leave it all out there. Respect the game. Persist to the end.\" Leonel's gaze blazed. \"Alright. Z personnel, Y boot swing over, motion zig fade. On one, on one. Break!\"\nLeonel walked to the line, his heart as calm as a lake. The blaring cheers of the rocking stadium, the countless flashing cameras, the sea of white uniformed enemies glaring at him like a piece of meat… It all rolled off his shoulders as though they weren't there at all.\nWith a light smile, Leonel turned his head to the right of the field, his arm slowly raising to point at a familiar freshman.\n[It can't be! Morales is doing it again!]\n[Ahaha! This is the spirit of the game! To call out your opponent on the final play, what guts, what imposing grandeur!]\n\"Blue 21. BLUE 21. Down set. HUT!\"\nThe ball spiraled through the Royal Blues' center's legs, hitting Leonel's palms perfectly.\n[It's a designed boot to the right! The Royal Blues really are targeting the rookie this time!]\n[The rookie slipped up! He thought Morales was going to hit him with the hard count again and got caught flat footed! There goes Bennett, sliding past him for the corner fade!]\n[Morales sees him! This is it, Bennett is wide open!]\nLeonel rolled to the side, the football between both his hands. The Royal Blues hadn't run a single designed boot all game, the defense was caught completely off guard. By the time they realized what was happening, Leonel was practically alone on the right side of the field. The only others with him were the rookie, 21, and James who had faded to the corner of the endzone.\nThe rookie was caught in no man's land. He had no idea whether he should rush after James, or if he should try to get a hit in on Leonel, ending the game.\nIn the end, he rushed forward. He knew it was already too late to catch up to James, but maybe he had a chance at Leonel who was rushing toward him. Unfortunately… Leonel smirked. With a flick of his wrist, the ball soared over 21's head, landing right in James' hands.\n[Morales does it again! Royal Blues W—]\nThe deafening crowd fell into an eerie silence as the ball slipped through James' hands and the clock hit triple zeros.",

      "content": "James grabbed his helmet with both hands, dropping to his knees in despair. At a time like this, Leonel could only sigh.\nHowever, under the silence of the arena, a resounding boom of two clashing bodies sounded.\nLeonel grimaced, feeling his already fractured ribs break cleanly as his vision was filled with sights of the moon above.\nIt was then a loud whistle blew through the silence.\n\"Unnecessary roughness, roughing the passer, number 21. Half the distance to the goal, still first down.\"\nLeonel landed heavily on the ground, grasping at his chest with his eyes squinting in pain.\nThe rookie stood over him in shock. At first, he had let his frustration get the best of him. He had never for a moment thought that James would drop such an easy layup of a pass, so he unleashed everything he had on Leonel, knowing they would lose the game. Never did he think that his actions would give the Royal Blues another chance with zero seconds on the clock.\nThe medics rushed onto the field. Despite the Royal Blues gaining new life, the stadium still remained silent. The sight of Leonel writhing in pain made many send furious gazes toward the rookie and James.\n\"Bennett, get the hell off the field! Rook, you're in.\"\nCoach Owen coldly benched his Five-Star prospect. He didn't know what was wrong with James today, but he was clearly in his own head too much. It was impossible to use him for this final play.\nThe medics quickly lifted Leonel's jersey, undoing the bandage wraps from the first half to reveal ghastly purple and green bruises. It was simply impossible for a bruise to spread so quickly. The only explanation was that Leonel had suffered this injury very early on in the game.\n\"Don't.\" Leonel grabbed the hand of the middle-aged male medic who tried to take his pads off. \"There's just one play left, I got it.\"\nCoach Owen who had rushed onto the field frowned deeply, his arms crossed over his well-built chest and his mustache billowing.\nThe team stood around Leonel's slowly rising figure, solemn expressions on their faces. They knew that everyone made mistakes, but at the moment, they were having a really hard time forgiving James.\n\"What are you all pouting for? An injury timeout doesn't last forever, let's do this. Line up!\"\nSeeing Leonel's resolute attitude, the medics and Coach Owen had no choice but to jog off the field under the silence of the crowd. In those moments, the heavy breathing of the players who stood on their last legs was all that remained hanging in the air.\nLeonel's fiery gaze lit a fire under them all, filling them with a strength they didn't know they had.\nOn the sidelines, Conrad looked on with a gloomy expression. Victory had been in his grasp, yet it slipped away, just like that.\nLeonel slapped his hands together, standing behind his offensive line as though he wasn't injured at all.\n\"Blue 80. BLUE 80. Down set, HUT!\"\n**\nLeonel sat in the locker room breathing heavily. The sounds of celebration surrounded him, causing a light smile to play his handsome features. Who knew how they did it, but the guys managed to get their hands on a few dozen champaign bottles. Their wrist watches were probably beeping away with talks of the Underage Drinking Code.\nUnfortunately, he couldn't take part too actively. Though he could forcibly ignore his pain if need be as he did on the final game winning play, it was probably best he didn't move too actively, lest his ribs puncture his lungs.\n\"Stop moaning and groaning, cap. You're not getting out of partying tonight!\"\nOne of Leonel's O-lineman, Three-Star Center Milan Inga, slapped his shoulder without regard for his grimace. He swung back a flask of vodka, his massive fat covered body somehow appearing ripped of muscle at the same time.\n\"Oof, I already promised I'd come. No need to kill me first.\"\nThe guys laughed, hopping in the showers one after another.\nLeonel gingerly took off his sweaty pads and undergarments, taking his time. He planned on hopping into the showers last. Although he was pretty certain that Aina wouldn't come, he still had to put his best foot forward just in case. Luckily, he had already prepared a decent outfit. It wasn't as flashy as what those rich boys could bring out, but he was still happy with it.\n'I'll probably have to have one of the medics re-bandage this for me.' Leonel thought to himself.\nHearing a sudden plop by his side, Leonel turned from his locker to see his coach half dozing off, a strong scent of alcohol leaking from his mouth.\nLeonel laughed. \"Coach, you're gonna get yourself fired going around like this.\"\n\"Bah, fuck those preppy pricks.\" Coach Owen tipped his flask up as though mockingly toasting the very people he insulted. Leonel almost didn't understand his slurring words.\n\"Look at you, how embarrassing. You get like this every year.\"\n\"What's it to you? You're gone after this time anyway, off to the bright lights of the NAFL. This old man will just stay in his little town.\"\n\"Pft.\" Leonel couldn't hold back his laugh. \"You're the coach of the best Academy football program on Union Continent. Your salary is enough to retire now and live a life of luxury until you finish putting that other foot in the grave.\"\nUsually, Coach Owen's mustache would blow and he'd have another witty comeback waiting for Leonel. But this time, his response was completely unexpected.\n\"… Thanks for choosing Royal Blue, kid.\"\nLeonel was stunned silent for a moment. He very well could have chosen Angel Wing, allowing him to attend the second ranked Academy. But, he chose Royal Blue because he liked Coach Owen's straight forward personality. As for the first ranked Academy, they didn't have a football program, seeing the entertainment path as something beneath them.\nIn the end, Leonel smiled lightly. \"Don't thank me, thank that dead rat on your lip. If not for how fun it is to poke fun at it, I would have never come here.\"\nCoach Owen laughed uproariously, slapping Leonel's back even harder than Milan had.\n\"Finish drinking that green vomit your old man gave you, kid.\"\nIgnoring Leonel's grimace of pain, Coach Owen walked away.\n\"… Enjoy it while you can…\"\nLeonel was too busy trying to calm his pain with ice to hear Coach Owen's last words. But, they were never intended for him to hear to begin with.\nAfter his pain pangs slowly faded, Leonel dug through his locker to find his black bag. Pulling a familiar bottle of green sludge out.\nAs far as Leonel knew, his father worked in a government division that focused on nutrition and enhanced nutritional supplements. The Ascension Empire believed that while their technology advanced rapidly, the human condition lagged behind. So this unnamed division worked toward maximizing human potential with food.\nThis gross concoction was one of his father's creations. According to his Gene Assessment, he was slotted in to grow to six feet tall. But, after drinking this poison everyday, he superseded that by three inches and might very well gain another inch or two by the time he reached his twenties.\nOf course, Leonel's father was actually a Four-Star General. He only went on to work in this unnamed division after he retired from military service. Then he proceeded to retire once more from said division.\nAfter chugging what remained of the bottle, a familiar scorching pain seared Leonel's chest. But, at the very least, his aching ribs dulled down a bit. It would probably take a normal person about two months to heal, but Leonel would only need about three weeks.\nTime ticked by and Leonel was finally the only one remaining. Though he could have used the 'Refresh' ability of his watch, he preferred taking a shower as did most people. There was just something about it that felt cleaner.\nTaking his time, he scrubbed every inch of his body before walking out with a towel around his waist and one hanging loosely over his head. Slightly obscured with a pattern of green, purple and brown bruises, his torso rippled beneath the heated steam.\nLeonel rubbed the towel through his hair, wincing as he struggled to keep his arms above his head.\nReaching into his locker, he put on a pair of deep blue jeans, a skin-tight white turtle-neck sweater, and draped over a long black trench coat.\n'It's only 8 pm right now, dad won't kill me too much if I'm home by midnight…'\nLeonel slung his backpack over his shoulder. But the moment he turned, his footsteps stopped.\n\"What are you moping around for?\" Leonel smiled toward James.\n\"I…\"\n\"If it's a struggle for you to tell me, then just don't tell me. There's no need for you to be sorry, that rookie would have hit me like that whether you caught the ball or not.\"\n\"…\"\nFor a while James didn't know what to say. But, he didn't move out of the way of the door either.\n\"… You knew you would get the unnecessary roughness call, right?\"\nLeonel's smile dimmed a bit, but he didn't respond.\n\"I know you too well. You don't like to lose, but you're too soft-hearted to call me out on my bullshit too. So, you'd find a way to protect our friendship and ignore it, all while winning the big game anyway. Am I right?\"\nLeonel sighed. \"Is there really a need to know the answer?\"\n\"Of course there is!\" James' voice rose. \"If you knew I needed your help, why couldn't you just lose this one time?! This is just a game, isn't it? You've already won three times, did you really need to win for a fourth? You don't even want to be a quarterback!\"\nLeonel's gaze narrowed. \"Whether I want to or not is irrelevant. In everything that you do —.\"\n\"I already know! I've heard it a million times. Respect and persistence. Respecting this garbage hand you were dealt, you're definitely the first. Congratulations!\"\nLeonel's eyes flickered with a hint of sadness.\n\"James, why are you being like this? You didn't even try to talk to me beforehand, we could have come up with a solution together. Did you think using being late to class as an excuse was enough?\"\nJames' expression rapidly changed, flaring with anger, then shame, then finally, capitulation.\n\"… I'm sorry. I lost my cool. There are just some things that… Never mind. It doesn't matter anymore. What's done is done.\"\nJames shook his head, recollecting himself.\nTurning away, James reached for the door. After a pause, he turned back with a bright smile as though nothing had happened.\n\"Come on, all your adoring fans are waiting outside to crucify me. The party's going down in Blue North Dormitory. We gotta get there before all the booze's gone.\"\nBefore Leonel could respond, James ripped open the door, unleashing a sound wave of flashing cameras and the shrieks of groupies.\nIn the NAFL, reporters were allowed into the locker rooms. But, since they were minors and the bigwigs were worried about optics, they were forced to wait outside at the Academy level.\nAt the same time, Royal Blue Academy's campus was usually locked down from outsiders, but there were rare occasions like today where those who paid obscene amounts of money or had appropriate connections could come.\nLike this, Leonel was forced to wade through a sea of reporters and fan girls with a bitter smile on his face, James' sinister laugh sounding off in the distance as he ran away.",

      "content": "It wasn't until at least half an hour later that Leonel managed to slip away from all the onslaught of questions. Since he was pretty much locked in to the first overall pick in the coming months, it was no wonder he was being hounded like this. That said, just because he understood, didn't mean he liked it.\n'Dammit, I'm late. I don't want Aina to misunderstand…'\nLeonel pedaled madly across campus, his silver bike streaking like a comet across the skies.\nAbout five minutes later, he finally made it to the Northern Dormitories. Since there were too many outsiders on campus today, he clicked a hidden button on his bike's frame, causing it to fold in on itself and becoming a silver rod about two meters long. In the end, it further collapsed, splitting into four pieces that neatly fit into his bag.\nThe blaring of music could be heard even from Leonel's distance away. He hadn't even entered the apartment-style building yet, but the sounds of clattering glass, laughter and club music was impossible to miss already.\nBlue North Dormitory was the male boarding house of the Northern Dormitories. It had the greatest luxury and accommodation of them as well.\nUsually, women wouldn't be allowed anywhere near this place, as their dorms were located in the south. But, nearing the end of Senior year, there was an unspoken rule among supervisors to let some of these things slide. At the very least, Leonel could see many of these blooming beauties through the windows and even strewn around outside, sneaking away with their lovers.\nSeeing these sights, Leonel sighed. Would Aina really come to such a place? Maybe he was asking for too much. Thinking to this point, his footsteps couldn't help pause.\nThese were some of his last chances to capture Aina's heart. If he failed now, who knew when he would see her again?\nAina was a Five-Star Professional. Leonel didn't know of what profession due to certain protections. In order to protect students from being poached and harassed by conglomerates and distracting them from their schooling, this information was usually sealed. Leonel was a special case in that he was an Entertainment Professional. As such, his protections weren't as great.\nConsidering how high Aina's protections were, she was definitely destined for a very important industry. The only reason Leonel even knew she was Five-Star at all was due to simple coincidence and a slip of the tongue.\nLeonel clenched his fists.\nHow well did he know Aina? What were her hobbies? Her favorite foods? Favorite color?\nLeonel didn't know the answers to any of these questions, however he was enamored. There were other women just as beautiful as Aina, some of whom had even tried to deliver themselves into his arms. But there was something about this woman in his heart that overshadowed them all.\n'If my profession isn't enough to be by her side, then I'll toss it aside.' Leonel's aura blazed almost like a beacon under the night skies.\nJust as Leonel was about to take another step forward, the sound of a crashing window shook him out of his thoughts. The screams of the female students shot across the night sky. However, the blaring music hadn't come to a stop.\nLeonel's gaze shot upward to a body half hanging out through a fourth floor window. A young man's lower back scraped along the now jagged windowsill, his body barely being suspended by the hand grasping his collar. However, it was clear that his hand wasn't trying to save him, but was rather likely the reason he was in such a position to begin with.\n\"James…?\"\nLeonel didn't wait even a moment. Breaking into a sprint, he tore into the dormitory.\nThose who likely didn't know what was happening upstairs due to the loud blaring music tried to greet him, only for him to blow right past, shooting up the stairs.\nLeonel reached the fourth floor in a flash. He had completely ignored the screaming pain that ran across his chest and torso. A fall from the fourth floor was no joke.\n\"Conrad!\"\nLeonel burst into the fourth floor's lounge room, his voice carrying a biting cold that overshadowed even the music that shook the walls.\nThe room was quite luxuriously decorated. Soft carpets, a Four Star Chef who stood behind a curved bar nonchalantly as though nothing was happening, and several table games from pool to foosball.\nHowever, Leonel's gaze landed on the very young man he had faced on the field just an hour ago. Four-Star Quarterback Conrad Siegfried.\n\"What do you think you're doing?\"\nLeonel's voice simmered, but it was somehow still possible to hear him clearly.\nHe scanned the room quickly, trying to get a read of the situation. He immediately noticed that there were several members of the Angel Wings here. This in and of itself wasn't a problem, but he had never heard of a losing team joining the winning side's after party like this. What could they be here to do if not cause trouble?\nIt was then Leonel froze. 'Aina?'\nHe was stunned. He had really been fully prepared for her not to come, yet she really was here. Not only that, but it seemed like her and her two friends were somehow involved in this scuffle.\nSeeing Leonel's genuine happiness the moment his eyes met Aina's, many inadvertently smiled despite the situation. Aina herself blushed and looked away, trying not to meet Leonel's gaze.\n\"Oh, so she's yours? It's no wonder why this guard dog reacted so furiously to my casual words.\"\nHearing Conrad's words, Leonel's expression once more became cold. He was smart enough to understand what must have happened.\nJames was likely here accompanying Aina and her friends knowing that Leonel would be a bit late due to his actions. At some point, Conrad came and tried to make a move on Aina, causing James to lash out.\nIt seemed that James was a bit too drunk, or else with his size and strength, there was no way Conrad could put him into such a situation.\n\"Let him go, are you trying to commit a murder with so many people here?\"\nIt was unknown who exactly, but the surround sound system of the fourth floor was turned down to the point only the music from the other floors reverberated through the walls.\nThe members of the Royal Blues gathered around Leonel without him saying a word. With their leader here, there was nothing that needed to be said.\nNo matter what, the Angel Wings were outnumbered here. Leonel didn't know what was going on on the other floors, but there were twelve members of his team here and only seven of them.\n\"So what if I do? Do you think I would be punished for it?\" He asked his question teasingly, as though he really wanted Leonel's genuine opinion.\nConrad's response caught Leonel completely off guard. He considered himself to be an intelligent person, but he was completely blindsided.\nAfter considering for a moment, he finally understood. Hadn't he committed a Felony just this morning? And that was just with his father's retired status. What of the Siegfried Family that was powerful enough to make the mere Four-Star Conrad rank higher than Leonel on the Eligible Minor List?\nIt wasn't that Leonel had never thought of this, it was rather that he never realized that someone could use this loophole to get away with murder. Weren't there limits?\nLeonel's crimes were completely innocent and put no one but his own self in danger. But Conrad actually wanted to cause the death of another person for nothing more than an exchange of words?\nLeonel fell silent under Conrad's sneer. He didn't notice that from the side, Aina observed him with a slightly curious gaze.\n\"Alright, drop him then.\"\nConrad's eyes narrowed. \"Do you think I won't?\"\n\"No, I'm certain you would. However, you'll have to face the consequences.\"\n\"Consequences?\"\nConrad's tension dissipated, a laughter shaking his body. James' body tipped further out the window, nearly disrupting the balance that kept him alive.\n\"And here I thought the mighty Leonel Morales was intelligent. It seems that you're just a fool.\"\nLeonel expressionlessly watched on as Conrad laughed. Several seconds ticked by before an uncomfortable feeling started to well in the latter's heart. Soon, even the remaining six Angel Wing players felt too stifled to laugh.\n\"Yes, consequences.\" Leonel replied plainly. \"If you drop my partner from that window, you seven will follow him right after.\"\nConrad choked on his own breath. Leonel's biting cold gaze pierced through his heart.\n\"… Do you really think you can say such a thing? Do you know who I am? For just this threat alone, the consequences you speak of are far beyond your wildest imaginations.\"\nAs though on cue, a voice once more sounded in Leonel's ear.\n[Infraction Code 22.31.4 — Murderous intent detected. Under the Speech Moderation Act of 2034, all manners of Hate Speech and Threats are classified as a Type 9 Misdemeanor]\n[It is advised that subject, Leonel Morales, rethink his coming actions. Any murders committed by subject in the next hour will not be considered in self-defense and can only be tried as second and first degree murder]\n\"I don't particularly care. Drop him.\" Leonel replied without taking a pause.\nEveryone could see the flashing lights of his wrist through the black coat that slightly covered it. The warning red lights only appeared as a warning to bystanders who may get caught up in the coming actions.\nHe really meant it!\nConrad finally froze.\n\"I may go to prison for the rest of my life. I may be placed on death row even as a minor. But you seven will be dead, so what chance are you going to get to gloat?\"\nThose who weren't involved in this sudden clash suddenly felt that their whole worlds were taken over by the sight of Leonel's silhouette.\nLeonel was maybe the person with the lowest standing of their Royal Blue Academy. There were others who entered only by their own merits, but none shined as brightly as he did. Yet, in such an elitist society, he had made friends with them all. There hadn't been an occurrence of Leonel being bullied for his background in a very long time.\nHe was a peer they respected, one who made them forget about how powerful their mothers, fathers, and families were, simply to enjoy his company… Seeing him stick out his neck in this way for a friend regardless of the consequences, it made their eyes redden.\nIncredibly moved, several more individuals stepped forward. There were no words spoken, but Conrad went from facing just twelve, to feeling the emotional tidal wave brought forth by almost thirty.\nAt this moment, Conrad was caught between a rock and a hard place. If he took a step back, he would look weak. But, if he continued along this path… He might really lose his life.\nIt was then that it happened. Centuries from now, historians would come to know this event as the Dimensional Descent. It was the day that Earth evolved and their plane of existence morphed. It was the day they ceased to be the top of the food chain.\nA loud blaring noise cut through their silence and the wall-shaking music of the other floors.\nThe expressions of everyone present changed, their wrist watches vibrating with several, continuous warnings.\n[Warning. Warning. We have entered a Code Red: Class 9 state]\n[Warning. Warning. We have entered a Code Red: Class 9 state]\nEveryone present knew exactly what this meant.\nCode Black. It was the lowest and most normal state. Class 1 was a normal day while Class 9 was used in situations like the spread of a minor virus. At most, the worst death totals would be in the few thousands to tens of thousands.\nCode Blue. It was a medium state of alertness. It was usually used during rebellion by one of the Paradise Islands or the Satellite Moon societies. The worst death totals would number in the hundreds of thousands, potentially millions.\nCode Red. This was a cataclysmic event. It was a situation where the Ascension Empire's efforts had to be focused on solving the problem as opposed to protecting its citizens. As a result, there would be very few individuals in position to help them…\nThe death totals would be within the billions. And Class 9 was the highest of them all.\nA sudden blinding light streaked across the skies. For a moment, it seemed it was day rather than night.\nEverything trembled. The ground, the air, even their bodies as though an inexplicable pressure was bearing down on them.\nGravity seemed to increase by at least 10%. The air grew heavier, a lack of oxygen making those around feel stifled. At the same time, their gazes grew foggy as a dizziness overwhelmed them. It felt as though they had entered an elevator that decelerated far too quickly.\nThen, everything shut down.

      "content": "While everyone was distracted, Leonel had already moved, making it to Conrad and James in a few steps and grabbing a side of the latter's collar himself. Another person might have chosen to fight off Conrad first, but Leonel was well aware how foolish such a choice was.\nNo matter what just happened, securing James' safety came first. No matter what happened between them, James was still his best friend. And, luckily, he had the now darkened lights on his side.\nAs expected, Conrad wasn't able to react. Seeing that Leonel now had a firm grip on James himself, he could only let go, allowing Leonel to pull James up.\n\"Leo…?\" James' words slurred.\nIt was only now that Leonel realized James had actually been unconscious. It was likely his head that had smashed the window apart, it wouldn't be surprising if he was diagnosed with a concussion. Coupling that with the fact he was drunk and it was a recipe for disaster.\n\"Heeey, maaan. You're late, my sister-in-law was waiting on yoouu…\"\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath through his teeth when James heavily leaned on him. He was really in no shape to be taking on such a burden, but he still carried him out, letting him sit on the couch.\n\"Chef, do you have any gas burners back there? We need some light.\" Leonel called out.\nThe Four-Star Chef who had not said a word even when James' life was on the line finally looked a bit shaken. He didn't seem to know what was going on.\n\"… Yes… We use a blow torch for the finishing touches of certain dishes…\"\nHe absentmindedly fumbled through the dark, pulling out the draw of a hidden compartment to take the torch he was speaking of. But, before he could think to hand it to Leonel, it happened.\nIn that few minutes, it felt that the planet would collapse. A cacophony of booms so loud Leonel had no choice but to cover his ears sounded. The earth beneath their feet trembled fiercer, the building swaying wildly from left to right.\nIt was then that Leonel froze. He didn't need to think to know what was causing this…\nThe Paradise Islands!\n'Dad…'\nA bout of worry seized Leonel's chest. No Paradise Islands were allowed to have routes that crossed over important landmarks. The top ten Academies, government buildings, and historical landmarks all fit this description. So, they were safe, for better or worse.\nHowever, Leonel didn't care about his own safety. He was worried about his father.\nHigher class Paradise Islands like the ones him and his father lived on had several safety features in case an event just like this one happened, however they weren't perfect by any stretch of the imagination. This was especially so considering the scope of this power outage.\nThe only slight hope was that Leonel and his father lived on a Paradise Island very close to the surface — the closest they could get, in fact. If their island crashed into some of the high rise skyscrapers first, it could slow its descent enough to save his father's life. These skyscrapers were exactly the very last line of defense for these disasters. They were built with this potential cataclysm in mind.\nIn the end, Leonel could only force his worry down.\nIf it was a normal power outage caused by some sort of system-wide failure, he would immediately run out of here, even leaving Aina behind. However, before everything happened, their wrist watches had warned of a Class 9 Code Red. It was very obvious that there was nothing normal about this event.\nSetting his jaw, Leonel weathered the shaking earth with his hands firmly clasped over his ears. It was lucky that their buildings were built with the highest earthquake technology, or there was no way it would have lasted this long.\nThe atmosphere became gloomy. Students who could go here didn't think often of the Paradise Islands above their heads. They would occasionally obscure the sun, but no more invasively than the clouds do.\nHowever, this time, with each crashing boom, they became more and more aware that each represented the deaths of countless innocent people.\nCompletely unprovoked, several began to heave and vomit. A putrid smell filled the fourth floor lobby along with mute sobs almost completely obscured by the vicious torrent of sounds.\nWhatever catastrophe the Ascension Empire warned of had yet to even begin, yet billions had already died. What kind of sick joke was this?\nA few who managed to keep their bearings looked toward Leonel with unconcealed pity. Even though he had closed his eyes and clenched his jaw, keeping his visage expressionless as he covered his ears, they knew well what he must be feeling.\nSome of them were in the same boat. Even if their families were affluent enough to have a home on the surface, not all of them were able to have a home in those protected zones. Their families might very well die by being crushed by those falling Paradise Islands.\nOver ten minutes later, the booms finally stopped, the earth still swaying beneath their feet. Maybe it was only now that they had become aware of just how many of those islands hovered above their heads… of just how many lives they hadn't even cared for to now.\nWhen they did, Leonel began to work as though nothing had happened. He carefully took James' shirt off, being mindful to support his head.\nAs expected, not only did James have a concussion, but the remnant shards of glass on the bottom ledge of the windowsill had left deep gashes to his lower back.\nAccepting the blow torch from the Four-Star Chef, Leonel borrowed a few scented candles from a resident of the dorm and lit them, finally giving them a semblance of light.\nLeonel wasn't a medic, but he had taken a few first-aid classes. He was unsure if the medics they had on standby for the game were still here, or if they had left to their homes. After all, it had been over an hour, approaching two, since the game ended. He didn't have the luxury of looking for them.\nCleaning out James' wounds to his lower back as best he could, he slowly removed pieces of glass stuck in his flesh. Finally, he wrapped them after disinfecting with some cooking wine he got from the chef.\n\"Love you, man…\"\nJames' drunk voice faded, only to be replaced by his light snoring soon after. Those here couldn't help but think he was the luckiest one of them all. Even if they tried to sleep now, they had no doubt that they'd fail.\nLeonel smiled and shook his head, his gaze turning empty for a moment. What should he do now?\nIn truth, he knew that the best answer was to stay put. Everyone else knew as well. As one of the protected zones, they could obviously be among the first to receive government assistance.\nBut, what was this Code Red? Was it just a worldwide power outage? Leonel had a feeling that it was more, but he had to admit to himself that he had no real evidence for this being the case. It was just that… how could the mighty Ascension Empire which unified Earth not be ready for such a thing?\nIt made Leonel think that there was something that caused this outage actively. It wasn't a mistake, but rather an event even their Empire had no means of stopping.\n'The good news is that we have room and board. The academy also stockpiles several years worth of food in an abundance of caution thanks to previous rebellion and hostage situations.\n'The bad is that the campus is current above its usual carrying capacity due to the game and the after party. Also, without power, the large freezers will slowly lose their heat. It'll be even faster if people are constantly opening and closing their doors.\n'It would be possible to take preemptive action and cure what we can. But, not many will listen to my words, they'll believe I'm being overly paranoid. The food here is enough to last a month easily before they start to go bad, no one would think that the Empire would be unable to recover in that time, so they wouldn't be willing to make sacrifices.'\nLeonel's thoughts spun quickly. A part of him wanted to act frugally out of caution, but another part understood that unless people had evidence toward how dangerous this situation was, they wouldn't listen. This was simply the way human beings were.\nIn truth, Leonel didn't want to deal with any of this. He only wanted to go and see if his father was alright, he didn't care about anything else.\n\"Damn, I can't stand this smell.\"\nConrad's high-bridged nose wrinkled. As soon as the swaying of the building normalized, he didn't want to stand there a second longer. Usually such a mess of vomit would be cleaned easily with their high-tech. But, this was obviously impossible now. It wasn't even a guarantee that they still had running water.\nLeonel didn't stop Conrad from walking away, and why would he?\nUnfortunately, it seemed that Conrad wasn't destined to get very far.\nThe building quaked once more. For a moment, Leonel thought that the foundation was too shaken by the previous earthquakes and that the dormitory was collapsing. But in the next instant, he saw something he would never forget in his life.\nIt was a spatial tear. Leonel was absolutely certain. He had never seen one, nor had he ever read the description of one, but he had a vivid enough imagination to know that if there ever was a spatial tear, it would look exactly like this. Maybe the only thing that deviated from his fanciful image was the fact it lit up the night sky as though it was day.\nOther than that, everything else was the same. The abrupt cognitive dissonance, its black, starry innards, the way it seemed to have no, and simultaneously endless, depth…\nLeonel's expression changed as it watched it through the shattered window.\n'It's expanding! We can't stay here!'\n\"Milan!\" Leonel reacted quickly.\nUnderstanding what he meant, Leonel's big offensive lineman strung James over his shoulder. Leonel would have done it himself, but his ribs were in no state to be taking on such a load. However, just as they were about to run out of the building, Conrad's voice cause Leonel to pause his steps.\n\"What the hell are you doing?! Do you know who I am, get the hell off of me!\"\nLeonel was taken aback. The very same young girl who had vomited during the fall of the Paradise Islands stood in the way of the closest exit, her gaze vacant. No, that wasn't accurate enough. Her irises had completely turned white, even her pupils followed suit.\nHer expression was cold. Leonel instinctually felt that it was impossible for the same girl who vomited just at the thought of dead bodies to display such a visage. Just what was happening?\nHer small frame suddenly took a step forward, her palm slamming into Conrad's chest.\nBy all rights, nothing should have happened. Conrad stood an inch taller than even Leonel and spent everyday of his life training as all their athletes did. In addition, he hadn't been injured in the game like Leonel had. At the same time, the small girl was just a Junior dragged to this party by one of her seniors and was barely 5'4\".\nYet, it seemed the illogical was the theme of this day.\nWith a dull grunt, Conrad was pushed back hard enough for him to fall to his back, a stunned expression on his face.\n\"You…\"\nA mixture of embarrassment and anger reddened Conrad's face. To make matters worse, he had slipped and fallen right beside the pool of vomit, causing him to inwardly retch.\n\"Hey…!\"\nLeonel's head spun in another direction, only to see yet another student with a gaze as vacant as the small girl's.\nIn a moment, one became two. Then two became three. In a flash, ten pairs of white irises shimmered under the blue light of the spatial rift, dully gazing toward them all. Among them, there was even one of his own teammates.\nLeonel's expression turned serious.\n\"Aina, Yuri, Savahn. Come here.\"\nThis time, the abrasive Savahn had not a single word to say. The nervousness in her expression was clear as she slowly entered Leonel's circle of protection along with Aina and Yuri.\nA spatial tear grew to their backs, their white pupil'd peers blocked their fronts, and an inexplicable feeling of uncertainty and fear pervaded their hearts.",

      "content": "Though Leonel's heart was assaulted with a whirlwind of confusion, it didn't show to his face.\n'Ten of them… Not overly dangerous but definitely uncontrollable variables… The Chef is most definitely the greatest hazard…'\nUnfortunately, the Four-Star Chef was among these white pupil'd individuals. Though he had yet to move from behind his curved bar, Leonel didn't need much of an imagination to think of just how many sharp kitchen knives must be back there.\nA few of the Angel Wings helped Conrad up, the tense atmosphere steadily growing.\nThe white pupil'd individuals didn't move, and neither did they. Leonel would have thought that they were observing them had it not been for the fact their eyes were too vacant. It didn't seem like any thoughts were going through their heads.\nBut if that was the case, then they should be acting on instinct. So, just what was this instinct?\n'They don't want us to leave this room?'\nThe steadily growing spatial rift to their back waned and growled.\nLeonel's eyes widened. He realized in an instant that this sound wasn't from the tear, but rather the groaning of the building as it was being slowly sucked inward.\n'Dammit…'\nHowever, even as everyone began to panic, Leonel grew calmer. His rational mind told him that there was a logical progression to all of this, there was a design to it.\nFirst their electricity goes out, second came the spatial tear, then there came these odd mutations to their peers and acquaintances, and now they were being pushed toward this spatial tear.\nIf the goal was to kill them, why wouldn't these white pupil'd individuals directly attack them? They even had the backing of the Four-Star Chef. However, they chose not to do this.\nJust when Leonel was going to resolve him to hop into the spatial tear, a shard of glass flew from the windowsill James had just hung from. It collided with the spatial tear, ripping into pieces with a chilling noise.\nNo matter how steely Leonel considered himself, he couldn't help but shudder. Is that what would happen to his body if he entered?\n'Dammit…' He thought to himself a second time in just as many seconds. '… We have to make it past.'\nLeonel knew that James was right about him, he was too soft hearted. He had actually almost made such a reckless decision because he would rather risk himself on a gamble than fight his classmates. But he realized now he couldn't do this, he had to steel his heart.\n'Focus on the known commodity.'\nLeonel's jaw set. \"Let's go.\"\nWithout another ounce of hesitation, Leonel took a strong step forward, heading toward the petite girl.\nCrossing by Conrad and his teammates, he appeared before the girl more than a head shorter than him. Gritting his teeth and ignoring the pain, he quickly pulled his long black coat off.\nHolding onto its shoulders, he whipped its buckled ends toward the girl's head. He didn't know how intelligent these white pupil'd people were, but he emphasized his speed and cunning. At the very least, his first gamble paid off. The others weren't quick enough to react to his sudden movement.\nSavahn covered her lips in a gasp, wanting to call out to Leonel and stop him. But, it was already too late.\nThe little girl's dull eyes didn't seem surprised at Leonel's action. Or, maybe it was just that she wouldn't be surprised about anything in her current state. Without much thought, she reached forward in a lightning quick motion to grab the ends of Leonel's coat before he could react.\nBut it seemed Leonel had been expecting this. Following the curved path he flung his coat forward with, he wrapped around to the girls back. He used her own grip against her, pulling the coat across her back and around.\nIn a flash, the frail girl had her arms tied down by Leonel's coat and his arms.\n\"Let's go!\"\nAs Leonel spoke, the other white pupil'd individuals began to move. However, Leonel had already thought this would happen.\nPulling the knot he tied with his coat around the girl tight, he pushed her forward into her own pool of vomit.\nAs expected, she regained her balance quickly with inhuman reflexes, only to slip when her soles touched the pool. Without being able to recover again, she fumbled and fell amidst Conrad's group, slowing their forward momentum.\nConrad's group had been the closest to the exit. It was no doubt that they would take advantage of Leonel's actions first. For men who had almost been complicit in his best friend's death, he wouldn't be soft on them.\nAs for the white pupil'd mutants, Leonel could only push his guilt down. He subconsciously felt that it wasn't their fault, but if he made concessions for them, he would be putting the life of him and his friends in danger.\nBy the time these things happened, the members of the Royal Blue, the party goers, and Aina plus her friends had made it to Leonel's side, pushing through to the exit.\nLeonel signaled Milan who still had James over his shoulder with his eyes. The big guy reacted immediately, kicking the couch James had been laying on over and creating another barrier.\n\"Leonel!\" Conrad's enraged roar tore through the commotion, his gaze reddening with rage.\nUnfortunately for him, Leonel had already turned away, causing Conrad's heart to go cold. He suddenly regretted his previous actions. However, what he regretted wasn't the fact he threatened James' life, but rather that he hadn't taken control of the white pupil'd girl before Leonel got to her. He had been the closest initially, why was he always lagging one step behind him?!\nLeonel didn't have time to worry about Conrad's thoughts. The white pupil'd individuals were just an afterthought. What really shook him to his core was the spatial tear. He hadn't felt that death was this close since the first time he sky-dived from his Paradise Island.\nBut… Leonel had made a mistake. In all his calculations, he had forgotten one important fact: they were on the fourth floor.\n\"Dammit, they're everywhere!\"\nZavier, a Three-Star Safety of the Royal Blues, shouted from the staircase. His words were like the whisper of the grim reaper to Leonel's ears.\nLeonel hadn't taken into account that if such odd occurrences were happening on his floor, how could they not be occurring on others?\nRushing into the stairway and slamming the door shut behind him, Leonel looked forward with a grim expression. The problem was worse than he had first believed. On the stairway, three pairs of white pupils were waiting.\nThe lights were far dimmer here due to a lack of windows and the fact the power was still out, so they almost looked like floating orbs in the night, sending a shiver down Leonel's spine.\nMilan stood to Leonel's right, his back against the door just like him. Before them the three girls were already half way down the flight of stairs while Zavier and a few others were ahead of them and steadily backing away from the the three mutants.\nLeonel bit his lip, almost drawing blood. It was one thing to put some bruises and broken bones on the line on the football field, but it was another thing entirely to have death looming over his head like this.\nHe still didn't know if his father was alive. He still hadn't shed the stigma of his profession. He still hadn't heard Aina's answer…\nLeonel's gaze shifted to her back. Even in the dim light, she had an alluring charm. Her figure held a steady maturity to it.\nAina had always been like this. She was shy in the face of his naked adoration, but she was the only one who seemed capable of continuing to write her exams under his presence.\nThe leaning of the building grew fiercer. By now, Leonel knew it was already too late.\nA banging on the door came from behind him. With each passing moment, it grew fiercer before it suddenly stopped entirely.\nLeonel sighed. Conrad and his group had probably been sucked in first due to the open window. There were no large windows in the stairway, nor were any of them broken open, but it was still only a matter of time.\nHe faintly hoped that in their last moments, even if he couldn't see his father, that Aina might say the words that could put a smile on his face even now. But, her small frame seemed to have no intention of turning.\n'Maybe I was wrong. I guess she doesn't like me…'\nThese were Leonel's last thoughts before the building gave way, snapping off from its foundation and flying into the spatial tear.\nThere was yet another thing Leonel was wrong about, though. The spatial rift didn't take everything. The moment those with white pupils touched its surface, they were safely rebounded away.\nThe grotesque sounded of sheering metal, brick and foundation sounded through the air, in an odd way, it almost sounded like chewing… As though the spatial tear was having a good meal as it smacked its lips.\nAll around Earth, similar events occurred. Many shared the same thoughts of agony and despair Leonel had. Many more had suffered terrible acts of revenge, guilt and sometimes even both in just those spare few minutes.\nThe world was changing in a completely unprecedented way. There were some who managed to escape the tears, but it was impossible to tell if their situations were any better. In a world filled with white eyed mutants, normal humans had suddenly become the minority.\nThe odd mutations continued, even transcending the human race and affecting the other animal kingdoms.\nHowever, even as their population grew, they did nothing. They stood silently, their pale eyes gazing vacantly toward empty space. Even those who stood just a few steps from another of their kind didn't speak, as though they were all collectively waiting for something.\nThe so-called government response never came. Ascension Empire's Paradise palace stood majestically, spanning hundreds of meters to the left and right, but it too was silent. Only the slight whipping of its high masted flag moving with the wind could be heard for several kilometers.\nIf one wanted to speak of the death of a world, it seemed that such a description could be any better. However, the world hadn't ended. Not just yet, anyway.\nLeonel and his group lay unconscious on a bed of eroded limestone. Around them, half broken pillars stood, etched with ancient runes impossible to decipher.\nAn odd energy swirled around them. At first glance, it seemed to be much more like fog than anything else. However, it behaved completely unlike fog. Instead, it moved and almost breathed like a living entity.\nOver half of this 'fog' surged toward a delicate sleeping beauty. Compared to the disheveled appearances of the others, she looked as though she was doing nothing more than taking a sweet nap. Her visage made many want to scramble to protect her, the light smile on her pink lips causing a twitch in the hearts of those lucky enough to see it.\nA fifth surged toward a young man with long blond hair and a high bridged nose. Even in his sleep, he scowled fiercely as though facing an enemy. The disdain was almost painted onto his lofty cheekbones.\nAnother fifth descended toward a tall young man with bandages wrapped around his torso. He snored loudly, rubbing his stomach without a care in the world as he turned over.\nThe remaining portions spread out evenly, seeping into the bodies of the remaining unconscious youths completely unbeknownst to them.\nThe hours continued to tick by. And eventually, it became days. However, they all kept a comfortable smile on their faces as though it was a soft cloud and not hard rock they slept upon.\nFinally, on the fourth day, the first of them began to stir.",

      "content": "Leonel stirred awake. His eyes blinked for a moment before he sat up far quicker than he should have, something that he instantly regretted.\nHowever, the sharp pain he expected from his ribs never came, causing him to look down at himself in confusion.\n'My injuries are healed…? Wait, where am I?'\nLeonel was bombarded with a sudden wave of sensory information. The limestone beneath his butt and hands, the odd wind that gently blew against his exposed skin, even the ancient smell in that hung in the air, almost reminiscent of a copy room with a slight mustiness to it.\nThe feeling made Leonel keel over, vomiting out the contents of his stomach. It was just that his belly happened to be quite empty at the moment, so he could only dry heave.\nBy the time his body finally stopped convulsing, Leonel was left with a bitter feeling of confusion. Everything seemed too loud, too bright, too textured, all at the same time.\nNo matter how much Leonel willed it away, it didn't seem intent on disappearing. He sat there for hours, feeling sicker than he had in all his life.\nThe world had suddenly become too detailed for him take in. It was as though he was staring at an optical illusion puzzle, one that if you gazed at long enough, it would appear to be moving. Yet, this wasn't an optical illusion, it had become his reality.\nHalf a day later, Leonel felt his throat burning. He felt a thirst he had never felt before in his life, but there was simply no water here, there was nothing but ancient ruins and the unconscious bodies of his friends. He would go look for water if he could, but every time he tried to stand, his head would spin.\nNot only did the world give him more detail than he could handle, but his body did as well. He could almost feel thoughts forming in his mind, he could feel the electrical pulses going from his brain to his limbs, he could feel the powering of every cell as they contracted. Just simple movements felt worse than even observing the world around him.\nOut of desperation, Leonel slowly slung his backpack off of his shoulder. Luckily, when he had been forced to use his coat to bind that girl, he had taken his backpack off and hung it from one arm. If not for this, he didn't think he could manage to do even this simple task.\nTaking out a familiar bottle of green sludge, he brought it to his lips, drinking shakily. Unfortunately, he could only feel a wave of despair, remembering that he had finished the rest of it after Coach Owen reminded him to.\nNever in his life did he think he'd miss his dad's vomit brew.\nParched, he still tilted the bottle as far back as he could, licking up the faint drops that touched his tongue. He didn't know if it was because of this sickness that had taken hold of him, or the stress of the past day, or maybe it was just pure frustration, but Leonel's chest welled up with rage, his eyes watering.\n'Dad… I miss you.'\nWhy was any of this happening? Why did the world suddenly collapse? Why was it that his friends wouldn't wake up no matter how hard he shook them?\nLeonel laughed self-deprecatingly. How pathetic of him. He didn't know how long he had been out for, but as for how long he had been awake, it was not even a full day, yet he was already breaking down like a fragile baby.\nAt that moment, something fell from Leonel's tipped bottle and left a paper-cut on his nose, causing him to wince. That was nice to know, apparently his pain was amplified several times over too. A little micro cut and he felt worse than when his ribs had cracked.\nWith slow movements, Leonel once again lowered his arm, delicately picking up what had fallen. It seemed like a rolled up piece of flexible fabric.\n'Wait… Is this paper?'\nLeonel was stunned. Paper had been made obsolete a long time ago. In fact, it was all but illegal. Though paper itself wasn't banned, the use of trees and other plant life to manufacture products had been heavily restricted in the Nature Protection Act of 2046. How had his dad gotten his hands on something like this?\nIn truth, Leonel wouldn't even recognize it had it not been for his robust education. If others knew he had this, both him and his dad would be in a lot of trouble.\nHowever, thinking about the state the world was likely in right now, Leonel couldn't be bothered to care. His wrist watch also no longer had any ability to monitor him.\nUsing delicate movements, he unfurled the roll of paper, wiping the bits of green sludge that stuck to it away.\n'By the time you read this, I'll already be gone.'\nLeonel's heart stopped beating.\n\"Dad…\"\n'Haha! You probably thought I meant I died right? Be honest, you started crying, right?'\nLeonel's mouth hung open for a moment before he started gritting his teeth.\n\"Damned old man! Don't let me catch you…\"\nFor a moment, Leonel forgot about his odd sickness. He scolded his father relentlessly, but the smile of relief that hung from his lips was clear.\n'Don't worry, there's no one on Earth who can threaten me. Those folks haven't dared to bother me for a long time already.'\nLeonel raised an eyebrow, but he could only keep reading.\n'There's not much I can tell you here. I was tempted to make like a father in anime and disappear without a word, but I thought you were too much of a crybaby to survive through that.'\nLeonel opened his mouth to refute, but remembering the mental breakdown he almost just had, he swallowed his words. In the end, he just laughed, his poor mood dissipating completely.\nHis dad had always been a big anime fan, they often watched all the oldies together. Still, only he would make such a joke during a time as serious as this.\n'So, I will be quick.\n'First, don't bother trying to wake up your friends. You've likely woken up long before them, and they won't wake up for at least several months. Focus on yourself for now and use your nepotism to your advantage.'\nLeonel's expression flickered.\n'Don't wonder too much about what I mean by that. Just know that your mother isn't dead, nor has she abandoned you. I also haven't abandoned you. We both love you very much.\n'Your body is different from others in this dimension, and the scar across your right hip isn't there by accident either.'\nA frown set in on Leonel's brow. He had a faint scar near where his liver would be. But, he hadn't thought about it in a long time. In fact, most people would miss it even if he had his shirt off. He didn't know why his father would mention it now.\nBut the idea that his mother was alive took over his thoughts. He felt an agitation he hadn't felt in a very long time.\nHe had faint memories of his mother. His father had never explicitly told him that she had died, so he always assumed that it was to spare his feelings about her death. Or, maybe to spare his own feelings because she had left them.\nHearing the truth, Leonel felt a weight he hadn't even known he was holding onto fall from his shoulders.\n'Second, your awakened ability is related to your senses and mind. I don't know the details since I had to suppress it in your youth, but it should be fully bloomed now. It can be overwhelming, but simply meditate until your body reaches equilibrium.'\nLeonel blinked. Meditating wasn't complicated, it was just about emptying your mind. The military taught a version that allowed you to sleep and rest your mind while remaining alert.\nLeonel's father had learned it while he was a Four-Star General and taught it to him because he was curious. He hadn't used it in years, though.\nWithout waiting, Leonel tried it, emptying his mind. Slowly, the overwhelming feeling dissipated, replaced by a sharpness that stunned Leonel. Feeling much better, he turned his attention back toward his father's note.\nHe was shocked by the fact it felt he was reading the words through a magnifying glass. Just what was this 'awakened' ability?\n'Third, I've left you two things in the basement. One is the truth behind what is happening here and the second is an heirloom of our Morales Clan. Unfortunately, until the Metamorphosis begins, taking these things out to hand to you directly is too dangerous. So just take it as this old man giving you a little quest.\n'Stay safe, son. The trial you'll face now isn't like anything you've faced before. I've taught you some things, but I definitely haven't taught you everything. You'll have an advantage being the first to take it, however with advantages will always come disadvantages.\n'Love, dad.'\nLeonel sat silently for a long while. He lost count of how many times he re-read his father's words. Unbeknownst to him, he had actually completely memorized it the first time, a fact he didn't realize until maybe the sixth or seventh read through.\nHis memory had always been good… but it definitely wasn't this good.\nFinally, Leonel felt he had wasted enough time. His father said it was an advantage for him to wake up first and that it had somehow happened because his constitution was different from others. At least that's what he gathered from his words. Since that was the case, sitting here for any longer would be throwing away his good fortune.\nLeonel took in his surroundings.\nLike everyone else, he was on a crumbled limestone platform that seemed a cross between pale yellow and brown. The pillars that surrounded the platform were severely eroded, most of them not even standing to their formerly full height.\nIn the four cardinal directions, there were four flights of stairs downward. It seemed that they were atop a temple of some sort. But, what was truly shocking was the fact that beyond this temple, there was nothing but formless space, an endless black without mass or substance.\nAs though sensing Leonel's intentions, four portals not much different from the spatial tear that brought him here appeared.\nNone of them seemed to separate themselves from the other. Leonel couldn't tell if this was because they all led to the same place regardless, or if this matter was purposely left to chance.\n'The ancient runes are definitely Mayan script. But why would they appear here?'\nGritting his teeth, Leonel put his bag down, switching out his jeans and turtle neck for his gym equipment. He didn't know what was going to happen, but he felt that sweats and compression clothing would be far more helpful to him now.\nHis gray sweats scrunched at his ankles, his black long-sleeve compression shirt clinging tightly to his toned torso. He felt more free now, he just wished he had had the chance to wash them before he had to wear them again. This smell was terrible.\nAfter hesitating for a moment, he also took out the three-piece silver rod his bicycle was formed out of, screwing them together back into their combined two meter length.\nLeonel wasn't exactly a martial arts expert, but he felt for someone as inexperienced as him, having a longer ranged weapon would keep him relatively safer. Whether or not that was true, he didn't know. But, he did know that the frame of this bike was strong enough to withstand his jumping down several meters without giving way. Considering he weighed over 200 pounds, it was definitely a strong material with some heft to it.\nFacing a randomly chosen portal, Leonel steeled his heart. However, after a moment, he hesitated again.\nTurning to Aina's sleeping form, he gently placed his bag under her head and covered her frail arms with his turtleneck sweater. He couldn't help but smile when her nose scrunched up with disgust, likely catching a whiff of his sport's wear.\nHe had never been this close to her before. In fact, this was also the first time he had ever touched her. He tried his best not to take advantage of her despite the softness of her supple skin and long black hair.\nHer faint lines of makeup showed signs of fading after so many days. But, Leonel realized that Aina had actually used some tricks to downplay her beauty. He couldn't see it all, but it was enough to grip his heart firmly. He even felt an impulse to wipe off the rest, but he held himself back.\n'I hope that you'll show me your true self one day.' He thought to himself silently.\nWithout another moment of hesitation, he stood and walked to a portal.\n'I may not come out from this alive, but at least you'll have something to remember me by.'\nLeonel's thoughts sounded morbid, but his heart was more relaxed than it had been in a long time. Knowing that his father was alive, and that even his mother was too, he felt as light as a feather.\nUntil he saw them again, until he heard Aina's response, he had no intention of dying.\nWith that, he took a leap into the whirling pool of blue, vanishing.\nThe temple he had left behind fell completely silent, the portals shrinking and finally disappearing. This silence would reign for many more months.",

      "content": "Leonel felt a slight dizziness that soon disappeared. He could vaguely feel that his quick recovery was anything but natural, however he didn't have much evidence to back this.\nHe found himself in a long corridor, dimly lit by flickering torches that hung from the walls. Large irregularly shaped stones formed the bricks that built the surroundings, giving the place the feel of an ancient tomb.\nJust as Leonel was about to take a step forward, something completely unexpected happened.\n[Subject detected. Leonel Morales, 17]\n[Credit: First to enter Sub-Dimensional Zone. Accomplishment recorded]\nLeonel stared blankly at the wrist watch on his arm.\n[Earth is currently in a state of metamorphosis, ascending from the Third Dimension to the Fourth. Its present state is that of an In Between Dimension. To complete the evolution, certain requirements must be met. The Ascension Empire will rely on its citizens more than it ever has before, Godspeed]\nTo someone else, maybe these words would have had a calming effect. But to Leonel, his chest tightened as he tried to suppress the desire to simmer with rage.\nLeonel didn't know what was going on, but what he did know was that whatever 'metamorphosis' was happening didn't account for this oh so 'helpful' aid on his wrist. This meant that the Ascension Empire knew that this change was coming and did nothing to prepare for it.\nNo. That wasn't accurate. They had prepared. It was just that they felt the lives of the billions who fell from the skies weren't worthy of protecting. The Empire was capable of creating technology that worked in this 'In Between Dimension', yet they hadn't made it widespread.\nEventually, Leonel's anger turned to laughter, his grip tightening around his metal rod to the point his knuckles turned an unhealthy shade of white.\n[Subject: Leonel Morales]\n[Ability detected: Sensory Type]\n[Ability grade: D]\n[Warning, margin of error for subject Leonel Morales is outside reasonable bounds. Only 5% of DNA recognizable. Abnormality recorded. It is advised that subject not trust his life to this data]\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone detected: Mayan Tomb. Spanish invasion]\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone grade: F]\n[Clear requirements: Enter Chief Priest's Sacrificial Room. Save Chief Priest]\n[Side Quest: Unable to detect. Scope of system too limited]\n[Reward: Unable to detect. Scope of system too limited]\nLeonel reined in his rage.\nHis initial instinct was to smash the watch on his wrist, however he knew this was foolish. His deductions told him that it wasn't normal for one who entered a Sub-Dimensional Zone to gain so much information without doing much of anything.\n'If this is a process of a world evolving from the Third to Fourth Dimension, I have a hard time believing that this is the first time such a thing has ever happened. Something about this is too systematic, too planned. It doesn't have the erratic nature one would expect from organic evolution.'\nJust how many instances of trial, error and failure were there in the evolution of a species? Too many to count. But something like being teleported into a new sub-dimension and having quests to clear sounded too phony. Leonel would die before believing this wasn't created by someone. And, he also had a feeling that said someone wouldn't expect its new batch of evolutionaries to have technology capable of doing such a thing.\nSo, Leonel concluded three things.\nFirst, the things that appeared in his mind from his wrist watch were just guesses. They likely wouldn't be 100% accurate. But there was a good chance they would be mostly correct.\nSecond, if his watch was already struggling with what it deemed an 'F' grade Sub-Dimensional Zone, then it likely wouldn't be useful for very long. Maybe by the time it got to the 'D' grade, it would be completely unable to tell Leonel much of anything.\nAnd third, since his watch was so limited, the likelihood of these changes being caused by the Ascension Empire were incredibly low. But… That didn't stop Leonel from keeping in mind the possibility that the Empire he had grown up in had saved the best 'systems' for those they deemed the most worthy. In such a case…\nLeonel took a deep breath.\n'Good, then I'll let you stay for now. Once you stop being useful, I won't hesitate to destroy you. Monitoring my movements and giving me nothing in return? I'm not so cheap.'\nIn the past, destroying this watch was as difficult as ascending to the top of the world. However, Leonel had a feeling that with these changes… The Ascension Empire's control was just that much weaker. Maybe they themselves knew this as well, or why else would they allow so many to die…? Maybe they wanted a more manageable population…\nThe sound of footsteps suddenly shook Leonel out of his thoughts. What was he doing? He was in the middle of a hostile environment with his life on the line. It was then Leonel remembered something even more horrid.\nThe Spanish had guns!\n'Dammit!'\nWithout hesitation, Leonel sprinted forward, his mind oddly clear. Every time he passed by a torch, he unceremoniously put out its fire.\n'First important point, temples are always built with many false turns and dead end pathways. Second important point, guns from this time period can only fire once as long as I don't give them time to reload. Third important point, my ability is a sensory type, I'll do better in the dark than they can.'\nAs though greeting Leonel's thoughts with open arms, the echoing footsteps and the sounds of armor clanging bounced off the walls and into Leonel's ears.\nIt was a magical feeling. Leonel could almost draw a perfect map of the trajectory the sounds followed, etching a path from his position to that of the Spanish with a line of three turns. It was as though he had gained a sonar ability, but it was much more complex than this because the sound wasn't coming from him at all.\nCompared to the heavy armor the Spanish wore, Leonel's sneakers were almost completely silent.\n'They just split apart, good. One group is headed toward me, there are three of them.'\nLeonel's heart beat wildly. He hadn't felt this way since the very first time he stepped onto a football field. The way his sweaty hands slid across his silver rod, the butterflies the flew through his stomach, how his heart seemed to want to burst from his ribcage…\nLeonel slammed his back against a wall at the edge of a corner, holding his rod tightly to his body with both hands.\nThe path he was on was the horizontal line of a 'T', while the Spaniards were walking toward him along the vertical line. He had managed to put out all the torches through the horizontal path, but had only made it halfway through the vertical portion before he was forced to run and hide here.\nLuckily, he was correct about his sensory abilities. Making his way through the dark wasn't an issue at all.\nWords Leonel couldn't understand entered his ears, causing him to inwardly curse. He knew how to speak three languages. English, French and Latin. He had a choice to learn Spanish, but because Aina chose Latin, he hadn't. Plus, he thought French was the language of love, so he had to learn it, right?\nWho knew his hormones would come back to bite him like this?\nThrowing these thoughts to the back of his mind, Leonel focused with all his might, steadying his breathing.\nHe heard the sound of metal scraping on metal, but it was much different from the sounds of armor he had heard before. Following this, the distinct sound of a sword being unsheathed followed.\n'That first sound should have been one of them pulling out a torch from the wall…'\nLeonel's jaw clenched. A faint part of him had hoped they'd be too stupid to think of this solution. But he knew that was asking for too much. Still, this put him in a better position. It wasn't possible to aim a musket if you only had one hand, let alone reload it. That was one less gunmen he had to worry about.\n'Come on… Come on… Turn right… Turn right…'\nAnd of course they turned left.\nHowever, Leonel was ready. As expected, the one holding the torch was in the lead. Without hesitation, Leonel swung down his rod fiercely, aiming for the hand that held the torch.\nA swarm of words Leonel didn't understand entered his ears, but he didn't need to be intelligent to know the torch wielding Spaniard was alerting the other two.\nIn order to properly wield their guns, the Spanish wore a armor that combined aesthetics of the medieval era and leather guards. Of course, these leather guards were on their hands and wrists. With Leonel's rod weighing just a bit over 30 pounds, did the soldier's wrist even stand a chance?\n'The barbarians are scuttling around like rats! AGH!'\nThe torch fell to the ground. Leonel kicked it away as far as he could without hesitation, collapsing the T shaped pathways into darkness once more.\nThough Leonel's actions were smooth and without pause, waves were inwardly flooding his heart. He was certain of it, he was several times stronger than he had been in the past. But, his ability wasn't related to the strength of his body, so what was going on?\nLeonel didn't have more time to think. The sound of sharply whistling wind rang out in his senses like a blaring horn.\nWithout hesitation, he dove backward. The feeling of a blade just barely tearing his compression shirt and into his skin played in his head in slow motion.\nSparks flew as the sword hit against hard limestone.\nAnother cry of pain sounded. They were normal humans, after all. If a mortal man swung a weapon full force at a stonewall, what do you think would happen?\nThe sword clanged, dropping to the floor. It wouldn't be a surprise if the Spaniard who had attacked broke his wrist just like his companion. But what choice had he had? With them descending into darkness, his only chance was to swing where he had seen Leonel last.\n'Two injured, one in full health. Can't let them retreat to the light.'\nWith a roar, Leonel didn't retreat at all. Raising his rod far above his head, he swung down as hard as he could, bashing it against the head of the Spaniard who had held the torch originally.\nEvery muscle of Leonel's body flexed to its utmost limit. He squeezed so hard that the line of blood that ran across his chest spurt out like a waterfall.\nThe sickening feeling of the metal helm bending under his rod made Leonel shudder. For a moment, he froze completely, his hands trembling.\nHe hadn't thought about it before. But… Were these people real?\nLeonel wanted to retch, but he simply didn't have the luxury. As one Spaniard crumpled to the ground, the shifting sound of leather sliding across metal caught Leonel's attention.\n'That's the sound of a musket's strap being pulled across chest armor!'\nLeonel's mind had completely memorized the appearance of the Spaniard's in the split second the torch had lit them up. He remember instantly that they had all had their rifles strapped to their backs. It was the only thing he could associate this sound with.\n'I can't sweep my rod from left to right, I'll end up hitting the wall first…'\nLeonel immediately dropped to the ground.\nHe choked up his grip on his silver rod, sweeping it upward through a pair of legs and turning it like a corkscrew. In a moment, the rod had swept across the back of one knee and the front of another.\nAs the Spaniard that broke their wrist against the wall tumbled forward and to the ground, the last Spaniard turned to the sound of the noise, blasting their single round.\nUnfortunately for him, both his partner and Leonel were on the ground, causing him to miss completely. However, the instant flash of light had allowed him to lock onto Leonel one more time.\nHis leg swung forward, hitting the kneeling Leonel across the chin.\nLeonel's mind spun. It didn't need to be said. The feeling of a metal covered shoe kicking you anywhere wasn't very nice, but this was especially so for the face.\nThe sound of a sword being unsheathed snapped Leonel out of his stupor. Maybe it was due to the fear of death being too great, but Leonel felt it was something else. When he was transported here, hadn't he recovered from the dizziness incredibly quickly as well?\nLeonel's mind worked quickly. His rod was still trapped between the legs of the fallen Spaniard, he didn't have time to pull it out. Plus, pulling it out would bring him closer to the rampaging Spaniard.\nUsing the momentum of the kick, he allowed himself to fall backward, landing near the sword of the Spaniard who had broken his wrist against the wall. The vivid image of it clanging against the ground had already been mapped in Leonel's mind\nLeonel accidentally grabbed the blade, but he could only suck it up.\nFlipping it in his hand to the handle, he ran it across the neck of the of the Spaniard he had tripped with his rod. The latter was confused about how he died even as he breathed his last.\nIn that moment, the last Spaniard was swinging wildly. He knew that Leonel had to be in front of him. If he kept going, he was sure that he'd hit him.\nHowever, his swinging arm suddenly stopped.\nCompletely shocked, he looked down in the dark, visualizing the sword he knew must have just gone through his heart. Till the end, he had no idea how Leonel had done it through his wild swings. How could he know that every time he swung, he was giving Leonel more and more information about his position…?\nLeonel collapsed to the ground, looking up at the darkness of the ceiling above him.\nHe slammed the back of his head repeatedly against the sturdy stone walls as though trying to forget what he had just done.\nHis hands fiercely trembled. Even in the dark, he could feel the sticky liquid substance coating his palms. But, there was nothing he could use to wash it off.",

      "content": "Leonel's breathing was erratic. For a long time, he felt a shortness of breath that didn't match with the abundance of air around him, nor his extraordinary physique. He could run a mile with a sub 5 minute time, yet this single exchange left him in shambles.\nOf course, he knew it wasn't because he was that exhausted, but rather because of his emotional state. Even if this was a 'game', it was too real. No matter how much he willed it, the dead bodies around him weren't disappearing.\nIn fact, Leonel knew the blood on his hands was actually his own. He had cut his palm on the sword he picked up from the ground the wrong way. But it still made him feel dirty.\n'Water…'\nLeonel knew he had to pull himself together. Who knew how far away the group they split from had traveled. They had gone too far for Leonel to hear their footsteps anymore, but the screams of these Spaniards had obviously been much louder than footsteps.\nSteeling himself, Leonel could only push his dark thoughts to the back of his mind. Maybe he was lucky that he was dealing with such a moral dilemma in such a situation, at least he didn't have the luxury to sit and sulk.\nAfter making up his mind, he jogged over to the torch he had kicked away during the fight and brought it over.\nRummaging through the bodies, Leonel found three flat circular shaped containers of water. Without hesitation, he drained two completely before strapping the third to his waist.\nThe wound on his hand and chest were pretty bad, but none of them seemed to carry bandages with them. Luckily, what they did have were flasks of alcohol. Leonel didn't hesitate to grit his teeth and pour it over his wounds.\nAfterward, he left his chest alone. But, for his hand, he snatched the leather guards the Spaniards used for himself. He also slipped on a chest plate and a helm. Of course, he chose the undamaged ones.\nHe took both muskets from the two Spaniards who had broken their wrists. He had no idea how to reload them. But, he did know how to aim and shoot. Safeties shouldn't have been invented in this era, he didn't think.\nEither way, he would get two shots out of them before discarding them.\nFinally, he took the two best quality swords with him, changing his silver rod back into a bike. Blades of this era likely lost their edge and chipped really easily. Having more than one, especially for attacking armored warriors, was definitely the smartest move.\nLeonel took a seat on his silver framed bike, closing his eyes and steadying himself. Soon, the sound of rushing footsteps reached him once more. However, it seemed the reason they had taken so long to get this close was because they were lost.\nAfter making a mental note to himself to memorize every path he crossed, Leonel's mind flashed with a plan. Not waiting another moment, he got to work. Not even a minute later, he pedaled his bike hard, reaching a dead end quickly.\nAt that moment, the next group of three appeared. They too had brought a torch with them, noticing the darkened tunnel.\n'What the hell is on the floor? Who pissed themselves?'\n'Those barbarian bastards!'\nIt seemed the Spaniards had finally noticed the corpses of their companions.\n'Over there!'\nOne of the Spaniards pointed toward Leonel who was sitting on his bike in the distance. But the reason he had noticed Leonel in the dark at all was precisely because Leonel was holding the same torch he had kicked away in the previous battle.\nUnfortunately, by the time they realized what was happening, it was already too late.\nA line of fire raced across the stone floors, swallowing the line of alcohol Leonel had drawn and reaching the three Spaniards and the three corpses in a flash.\nThere was no time to react. A harsh explosion sounded, burying the screams.\nUsing the flames as a light, Leonel brought a musket forward to aim, his hands trembling. However, he knew he had no choice but to shoot. There was no better opportunity to test the range and accuracy of these weapons. The flames had engulfed all three of them, but it likely wouldn't kill them in a short time.\nSteadying his sights as best he could, Leonel fired.\nThe recoil wasn't as bad as he predicted. In fact, he had overcompensated for it far too much. Still, his aim was terrible. There was little he could do about his trembling arms.\nLeonel could actually see the round bullet fly through the air. It was moving at speeds far beyond the limits of humans, but he could inexplicably track it. He didn't even need for it to land to know he had missed.\nBut that was when the unexpected happened. In their agitated pain, one of the Spaniards fell right into the bullet's path, allowing it to travel directly through his throat.\nEven as he crumpled to the ground, Leonel bit his lips so hard he drew blood.\n'Come on, Leonel. You're better than this. Maybe this is why that Gene Assessment slotted you in to spend the rest of your life throwing balls. That sort of safe profession is just right for someone as pathetic as you.'\nEven as Leonel was berating himself, he still raised his second musket.\nThis time he learned his lesson. His brain did calculations he wasn't even consciously aware of.\nWhen aiming, you had to not only account for where your target was, but also where said target would be.\nWith his second shot, the bullet stayed true, flying right through the eye of a second flame covered Spaniard.\nThrowing the rifles aside, Leonel gripped the handle of one of his swords. He pedaled down the path lit with flames, not worried that his tires would melt. His bike was far more resilient than that.\nLike a horsemen holding a lance from his steed, he sped toward the final Spaniard with a speed nearing 25 mph.\nHowever, even as he did so, he knew he wasn't ready to experience that feeling again. He couldn't stand the disgust he felt as a life dissipated under his own hand.\nSo, in an act of madness, he threw his sword forward with all his strength.\nIt perfectly arched in the air, spinning several times before its sharp edge entered the mouth of the screaming soldier. Like that, the hall fell into silence once more. Except this time, Leonel didn't have the luxury of darkness. He could only dully skid his bike to a stop, looking toward the pile of six corpses blankly.\nLeonel couldn't help but replay everything that had happened in his mind. The moment he remembered the fact guns of this era needed to be loaded with gun powder during every reload, the rest was simple. Everything from the alcohol flask to his use of the torch was perfectly calculated.\nBut once again, his actions had taken away more lives. It was fine to plan something like this out in your mind, but actually seeing the results painted a picture of something other than success for Leonel.\nHis throw in the end was something that really surprised him. He had subconsciously felt that he could count the number of turns his sword would take in the air and exactly where it would land before it even left his hand.\nA part of this probably had to do with his years of playing quarterback, but the much larger reason was definitely as a result of his new awakened abilities. He now knew he had great talent for throwing weapons.\nIf he recalled correctly, the Mayans were well known for their throwing spears. If he could find their weaponry, it would be of great help to him.\nLeonel knew he had to slowly adapt to reaping the lives of others. If he didn't get over his apprehension and fear, he was doomed to die one day. The world outside was no longer the world he had come to know, and the Ascension Empire wouldn't protect him.\nAfter yet another deep breath, Leonel took his musket straps off, tossing them to the side. They were no longer useful since he had no idea how to reload them. He would rather not have gun powder blow his arm off.\nWithstanding the scorching heat, he pulled his sword from the Spaniard's throat. Then, he pushed his bike backward to gain some distance before building up momentum to leap over the six bodies.\nOnly taking a single glance backward, Leonel didn't look again, pedaling down a new corridor to blow out a new line of flaming torches.\nThe cycle continued. Leonel never attacked a group of more than three, always waiting for them to split down different corridors before he made his move.\nEventually, he found a group of Spaniards who carried small hand axes with them which inevitably replaced his throwing swords. Though he could be accurate with either, the hand axes were more convenient. They were lighter and were better weighted, easing the pressure on Leonel's throwing arm.\nAside from this, there also came a point where Leonel carried no less than five or six rifles on his back. His look would have been quite comical had it not been for his pale face. He had hoped that the longer he spent in this Sub-Dimensional Zone, the more accustomed he would become. But the reality was that his guilt only grew.\nFinally, on the third day, carrying bloodshot eyes, Leonel descended a flight of stairs far too narrow for his broad shoulders and found the weaponry he was looking for. Unfortunately, it was flooded with Spaniards. Leonel counted at least 12. To make matters worse, there was no way he could use his normal darkness tactic here.\nHowever, there was good news. The narrow stairway he was on was purposely made this way to act as a hidden path. It seemed the Spaniards had yet to notice that the meter tall stone that covered its exit was a false wall.\nFrom here, Leonel was able to peek through the gaps to get a read on the numbers he was facing.\nAfter a moment, he gingerly turned, careful not to make any noise as he made his way back up. Though his sneakers were still silent, he had too many things on him now. It was lucky that the Spaniards were laughing it up and having a great time, likely comparing how many 'barbarians' they had killed, or someone would have already noticed the odd scraping sounds.\nLeonel reached the top of the stairs, re-entering the floor he believed he had cleared. There was nothing but darkness and the stench of blood in this place.\nTaking out a water jug, he emptied it before tossing it aside. Then, he carefully placed the stone that hid the top of the stairs back into place. He wanted to rest after not sleeping for an entire three days, but doing so in that narrow corridor was foolish. If anyone found it, he was finished.\nSo, Leonel back away, rounding a few corners to sit in the dark corner of a dead end. His nerves were still tight, but at some point, he grew too tired to avoid sleep any longer. Luckily, he managed to enter the meditative sleep state his father taught him before his consciousness slipped away.\nThe way he looked now, even if a Spaniard somehow managed to stumble upon him, they'd likely believe he was another of their fallen comrades.\nBlood coated Leonel's face and armor, numerous burn marks, bruises and cuts running along what small part of his skin were exposed. His sweat pants were in tatters, suffering several cuts through to his thighs and calves due to his lack of experience and recklessness…\nLeonel had no idea that this Sub-Dimensional Zone wasn't meant to be cleared alone. There was a reason four portals had appeared...\nHe could only cling onto his last bit of sanity as he slept in the darkness.",

      "content": "Leonel's eyes snapped open. He didn't know how long he had slept for, it was impossible to tell. There were no windows in this temple. He had only roughly guessed that he had been here for three days.\nUsing his silver rod to stand, he stood to loosen his stiffening limbs.\nLeonel's jaw set. His mind had regained its clarity. He hadn't even noticed that his senses had severely dulled the more tired he became. In fact, he felt that he was even sharper than when he first entered this Sub-Dimensional Zone now.\nWithout a word, he began to get ready.\nHe took his six rifles, strapping through across his left shoulder than the remaining three across his right.\nTwo days ago, he had almost lost his life because he trusted that these muskets were always loaded. He ended up aiming and firing one without a bullet, a mistake he could thank for the deep gash in his thigh.\nSince then, he learned to tell whether the rifle was loaded or not first. His method seemed simple, but maybe he was the only one on Earth who could do it. There was a very slight weight difference, maybe fractions of a gram, between a loaded and unloaded gun. If a gun was too light, he didn't keep it.\nOnce the six muskets laid organized on his back, he accounted for the eight hand axes around his waist and finally clutched his silver rod.\nWith a deep breath, he slowly made his way back toward the hidden path. It seemed that during his sleep, others entered this floor once more through the main stairway. Leonel could only clear them out first in order to avoid any untoward variables.\nThough his heart was still heavy, he managed to control his trembling hands this time. Without having to account for his wavering aim, his efficiency reached a new level, his throwing ability especially.\nHalf a day later, Leonel felt that he had emptied the floor once more. With how many Spaniards he had taken it, it was definitely only a matter of time before their leaders realized that something was wrong.\nAs expected, when Leonel went to peek on the weaponry, the 12 number he had counted before had increased to 18.\nThe weaponry was the largest space Leonel had come across to now. It was a rounded room with a single exit. All around, weapons hung from the walls. But, compared to the Spaniards, they were incredibly crude.\nThe Spaniards turned their noses up at these weapons. Not even a single one had been touched. But, who could blame them. It was obvious that Spanish weapon technology was more than a single level higher.\nThey had set up camp in this space for only two reasons. One was to stop the Mayans from regrouping and recouping strength. And second was to set up camp.\nIt seemed that this Sub-Dimensional Zone had deviated from history. There was much more of a stalemate than there should be. An internal battle was taking place within the temple between the two parties.\nWhat Leonel didn't know was that this was only due to his actions. He hadn't wanted to count the number of Spaniards he had killed, but it was over a hundred. There were only two thousand in total. He had single handedly taken down a good percentage of their army.\nAs a result, the Mayans had been able to put up some resistance. And, due to losing so many soldiers, the Spaniards had taken a step back, trying to re-evaluate the strength of their enemy.\nLeonel took a deep breath. When his eyes opened once more, his eyes had completely stilled, glowing in the dark like a predator stalking his prey.\nFirst, he took apart his silver rod. He didn't split it into all three pieces. Instead, he only took a single third of it. Using the small ledge on either side of the narrow staircase, he balanced both ends across it.\nIt was nearly a perfect fit, just barely over two feet apart. The remaining part of the rod was just over four feet in length, but it was enough. If Leonel was lucky, he wouldn't have to use it at all.\nDucking beneath the bar, Leonel nodded to himself. Then, he began to pour several flasks of alcohol through the small cracks in the false wall, drenching it as quickly as he could.\n'Hey, do you smell that? Smells like some good booze, who's holding out?'\n'Drunkard. What booze?'\n'Wait look over there!'\nThe highest ranking officer of the Spaniards waved his hand, forcing them to fall silent. He wasn't dressed much differently, but his armor was definitely shinier and he strapped a pike across his back and a long sword strapped to his waist.\nSuddenly, the stone was kicked over. It fell with a loud boom, kicking up dust that obscured the dark pathway.\n'Enemy attack! Form up!'\nA strong WHOOSH followed a flame erupting from the falling stone and the edges it had just been hidden between.\nLeonel steadied his breathing, kneeling behind the flames, he aimed his first rifle. He had seen everything he needed in that split second. And still now, he could see faint pictures of the changing situation through the flickering flames.\nHe knew he didn't have long. The alcohol would be burned away quickly and he didn't have any other sources of fuel with him. But he was already ready.\nThrough the short one meter high doorway, he aimed toward the leader and pulled the trigger.\nBANG!\nThe leading Spaniard who had just been giving out commands froze, his last words being lost in a spurt of blood that came from his eye.\nLeonel didn't pause. The moment he pulled the trigger, he retreated, leaping to up to the ledge above him and to the silver rod piece he laid across them.\nHe squatted down, balancing on the balls of his feet as he crouched across the silver rod.\nAs expected, a rain of bullets sounded and instant later, ricocheting off of the steps below Leonel.\n'One… two… five… seven… ten… eleven… sixteen… seventeen!'\n\"No way that barbarian bastard survived that!\"\nThe moment the Leonel locked onto the 17th fired gun, Leonel jumped from his perch, charging through the wall of already waning fire. He would have put his rod back together, but he simply didn't have the time.\nHe swung the second rifle from his back aiming it with a single arm.\nBANG!\nHe tossed the musket aside even as a Spaniard fell. Without hesitation he pulled out the third rifle.\nBANG!\nWith every breath and step, Leonel pulled out another rifle and another Spaniard fell. Five steps, five breaths, five rifles, five deaths.\nLeonel dove across the room the moment he dropped his final musket, making it to the side of the leader he had killed. With inhuman strength, he ripped the rifled from his corpse, his lip twitching when he realized it was too light. How could the leader be the only one without a loaded rifle?\nHowever, the other Spaniards didn't know this. Leonel couldn't allow himself to be surrounded, so he aimed the gun toward the closest soldier, causing him to retreat with fear coloring the eyes hidden behind his helm.\nWithout hesitation, Leonel tossed the musket aside without bothering to fire, reaching with his now free hand into his belt and pulling out a hand ax.\nHis back drew tight and his arm cocked back, his hand drawing a silver light across the air as he rocketed the ax forward.\nThe very same Spaniard who had retreated had his face destroyed in the blink of an eye, falling to the ground lifeless.\nLeonel worked quickly. His quick movements hid the dread that loomed over his heart with every life he took.\nIn a flash, there were only four left.\nLeonel picked up the leader's long sword from his corpse, holding it in one hand and his silver rod in the other.\nWith quick steps he retreated to the secret passageway.\nThe fear Leonel's marksmanship put into the Spaniard's was profound. Several of them thought of running, but the punishment for retreat was too severe. They could only hold out and hope the noise would capture the attention of the others.\nMost of their numbers were working on breaking through the Shrine Room. Only a few of them were tasked with guarding and resting here.\nHowever, when they saw that Leonel had run out of things to throw, they could only steel themselves and charge.\nLeonel's heart beat quickly. He had become used to fighting many opponents at once, but that was when they couldn't see him. This was completely different. Not only could they see him, but there was one more than he dared to fight alone even in the dark.\n'Calm down…'\nOver these several days, Leonel had realized something important. These Spaniards were just normal humans, they didn't have an 'awakened' ability. This was where Leonel's advantage lied.\nLeonel didn't wait for them to close in. He had been planning to retreat to the narrow staircase and take them on one at a time, but this wasn't smart. It might give them time to reload their muskets. He had to stay confident and not give them time to think.\nIn a flash, he ran up to the closest Spaniard. Yelling as though to force all the fear out from his chest, he swung down the long sword with everything he had.\nIf a swordsman saw him, they'd probably look away so as not to cringe. Not only was Leonel wielding a two handed sword with just one, but his wide stance and telegraphed movements were terrible even for a beginner.\nHowever, this wasn't an anime. No matter how good a mortal swordsman was, there was a limit to how well they could respond to wild movements, especially when their attacker was so much stronger than them.\nA scream of agony escaped the Spaniard. His arms hadn't been able to block Leonel's strike.\nThe long sword cut into his shoulder armor and into his collarbone before stopping. Such an injury left a normal human completely crippled. His death was only a matter of time.\nLeonel ignored the aching in his wrist, pulling the short sword from the fallen Spaniard, he threw it with all his might across the room, nailing the closest Spaniard in the chin. The blade split his lower lip and jaw in half, leaving him to fall over — dead.\nThe whistle of a swinging sword came from Leonel's left, but he was prepared. Raising his silver rod, he braced himself with all of his strength. Remembering what had just happened to the Spaniard he cut down, he knew the danger of failing to block properly.\nA sharp clang came. The Spaniard was shocked when he saw that his sword actually chipped against Leonel's seemingly simple rod.\nHow could the alloys of the 2100's not be far better than those from this era?\nThe rebound was violent, but Leonel used his larger frame and power to his advantage, recovering quicker and slashing across with his long sword. Another life fell beneath his blade.\nThis time he had learned his lesson. Cutting through metal was too difficult. This time, he only targeted the exposed vitals, using his great control to emphasize accuracy over power.\nPicking up another short sword, Leonel turned his hips quickly and reaped the last Spaniard.\nHis chest heaved, hot air billowing into and out of him. A scorching feeling filled his throat and lungs, but he didn't have the luxury of resting.\nHe sprinted with all his might toward the rounded opening of the weaponry. It was easily two and a half meters tall with a width that was just as large. Its door was a stone circle so massive it should take at least ten men to move. But, Leonel had no choice but to do it on his own.\nThe door was designed to be a size larger than the doorway. As long as he rolled it over from the inside, it would be impossible to open from the outside without destroying the stone first.\nThe sounds of shouts and footsteps filled Leonel's ears. The time he had left was too little, but he dug deep, pulling every ounce of strength he had left out.\n\"ARRGGHH!\"\nLeonel roared with all his might. His senses could pick up on his muscles tearing beneath the pressure, but he had no choice.\nHe pressed hard against the rolling door, finally feeling it move just the slightest bit.\nThe footsteps got closer and closer before Leonel could distinctly hear the shift from walking to sprinting.\n'The barbarians regained their weaponry! Stop them from closing the door!'\nUnder the strain, blood flowed from Leonel's nose. His teeth clenched tightly against each other to the point his gums began to bleed.\nA final roar escaped his lips, snapping the door into its closed position just as a Spaniard attempted to dive through. The ghastly sight of a man being cut in half was the last sight Leonel saw before he blacked out.",

      "content": "Leonel awoke with his body on fire, the slight whiff of something catching his attention. The smell made his stomach growl furiously, his mouth almost dripping with water despite how dry it felt.\nLeonel didn't know how his friends were being sustained, but he did know that he hadn't felt the need for water until he woke up. And, now that it had been over four days since the last time he ate, he finally couldn't suppress his hunger anymore.\nIt was only then that Leonel realized that the Spaniards had been roasting a full pig when he initially entered. He must have not smelt anything before because it had just started to cook.\nLeonel struggled to pull himself up, peeling all the heavy armor he wore from his body. He hadn't felt this light in a very long time.\nLuckily, since there was no one to tend to the fire, the embers had died off while Leonel slept, sparing the pig from being overcooked.\nIt was inevitable that it was still burnt in some places, especially since no one had been there to turn it, but Leonel could hardly bother to care. He ripped off a leg, devouring the meat madly.\nInitially, he had believed that a leg or two would be enough. But before he realized what was happening, he had already cleaned away half of the pig. Leonel had always been a big eater, but it was always within reason. Something like eating half of a 20 kilogram pig was far beyond his means.\n\"I want you to find that damned entrance! There's no way that barbarian entered from the front, there must be a hidden entrance! Look at how many of our people those savages have killed!\"\nWords Leonel couldn't understand drifted from the hidden entrance. It became obvious quickly that he didn't have much time. All those who saw him come out of the hidden staircase were already dead. But, it was only a matter of time before they started looking for false walls.\nBecause Leonel had knocked down the false wall on this side without replacing it, it was much easier to hear things than it had been in the past.\nMoving quickly, Leonel replaced his armor with that of the dead leader's. He was going to pour some more alcohol on his wounds first, but he was shocked to find that many of them had faded. In fact, the aches in his body from his torn muscles had become quite dull as well.\n'… Food. It must be food.'\nLeonel bit his lip. Where else would he get food so easily? There was no point in carrying this pig with him because it would go bad in at most a few more days. Plus, considering the pace at which he ate it, it wouldn't last that long either.\n'The only option is to continue to steal food or to leave this temple…'\nLeonel couldn't come up with the perfect choice now. He had to hurry.\n'I came here for… there it is, the atlatl.'\nAtlatl's were essentially sling shots for throwing spears. They were a wooden attachment one could slot a spear or 'long dart' into to gain more leverage. Then, using the same throwing motion one was used to, it was possible to throw more than double the distance and with much more speed and force.\nTo think such a thing was invented over 20 000 years ago, even before the era of the Mayans.\nLeonel abandoned his hand axes, using the belt he had stolen from a Spaniard to slip in a few atlatl's. Considering they were reusable, it was unnecessary to have more than one. However, Leonel had learned to plan for the unexpected.\nHe kept four atlatls with him on one hip and strapped a short sword on the other. He would have taken the leader's long sword, but he had his reasons for not.\nAlong the walls, countless barrels of throwing spears fitted for the atlatls. Well, to call them spears was a bit inappropriate. They looked like sturdy arrows one might fire from an large-scaled crossbow.\nHowever, Leonel obviously couldn't carry them all. He realized after carrying around his 30 lb silver rod for so long that his body's limits were far higher than they had been previously. However, it wasn't to an exaggerated extent.\nThinking to this point, Leonel chose a square backpack shaped of wood. It was about a meter and a half in length and by Leonel's estimations could hold about 50 atlatls darts or spears.\nHe filled it quickly. His initial instinct was to try and overfill it, but he knew this would be foolish. If he failed to pull out a spear at a critical time, it would be too late to regret it.\n'Let's test it.'\nLeonel took out one of his atlatls, fitting an extra spear to it, he held its handle like a javelin.\nThe spear sat atop the atlatls. As for the atlatls itself, it attached to the end of the spear, allowing it to sit upon it. The body of the atlatls, which Leonel held, curved back around like an 'S' drawn much too tall and lanky.\nFlexing his arm, Leonel bowed his body and launched the spear. But the results left him stunned silent.\nThe metal tip of the spear stuck into the stone wall, vibrating back and forth wildly.\n'It covered a 20 meter distance in 0.4 seconds. That's an average velocity of 50 meters per second or 180 kilometers an hour. It was even still accelerating when it hit the wall, so it still had more left. The effective range is easily anything within 200 meters…'\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath. First he was surprised at his sharp calculations, but he was even more surprised at just how much the atlatls improved his throwing ability. Such a simple technology, yet so effective.\nSnapping out of his stupor, Leonel ripped the meter and a half long dart from the wall and hid it within the barrels of spears. In case the Spaniards made it to this room again, he didn't want them to be able to figure out his limits.\nAfter that, he dug deep and lifted the stone that covered the hidden entrance back up and into its place. This way they wouldn't be able to tell which path he came from. Of course, he only did this after retrieving the last third of his silver rod.\nThat was right, Leonel had already found another hidden entrance in this very room. In fact, he counted a total of five. It could only be said that the Spanish were too negligent. Either that, or his senses were simply too sharp.\nFollowing this, Leonel left through the hidden pathway with the least activity on the other side, slipping away to unleash hell on the Spaniards.\nIn the following weeks, he mapped every floor of the temple with the exception of the lowest which he believed must have housed the Sacrificial Room.\nAs time passed, Leonel's senses grew sharper. He could hear footsteps from further away, and from those footsteps he could tell everything from the height of the soldier in question to their weight. At the same time, his control over his body reached great heights. He no longer threw will his full power every time, only using just enough to maintain his stamina and slay his opponent.\nAbout two days after he left the weaponry, he did manage to find a path outside. Once he had mapped out the hidden pathways he could use to reach it, he exited frequently, hunting for his own meals before returning.\nHe realized that he simply had no chance fighting the Spaniards from the outside. Without the ability to take advantage of guerrilla tactics, it was a futile effort.\nUnfortunately, as time passed, the Spaniards grew more and more wary, making it difficult for Leonel to find small groups to attack. As a result, he had no choice but to begin assaults on groups of four, five, eventually even groups of ten were the smallest he could find.\nHowever, at the same time, his skill grew more pronounced. His throwing ability was already at a near unconscious level, but it was his combat ability that took the greatest leap forward. He learned to keep his movements reserved, yet firm. Simple, yet potent.\nHe had never been formally taught in any martial arts, but as his mind spun and his deductive abilities deepened with his growing senses, he felt as though it didn't matter.\nWith every encounter, a new possibility was stored in his memory. With this additional data point, he would adjust his fighting style ever so slightly to account for it. Months later, Leonel no longer had to rely on his throwing prowess to gain victory against large groups. Even when battling a group of ten Spaniards, the combination of his inhuman senses and battle experience was enough to take them on.\nBy this point, Leonel was certain that his wrist watch's assessment of him bordered on fraudulent. He wasn't entirely sure how the grading system worked, but if others had higher grade abilities than what he was already able to accomplish, it would be far too exaggerated.\nLeonel reached a point where with a single glance, he was able to categorize his opponent by giving them an athleticism score. He broke down his categories into Strength, Speed, Agility, Coordination and Stamina.\nStrength was simple, just how much power a person could generate. However, with how many different ways strength could be applied, it became incredibly complex. Leonel chose to weigh this category by how much power a person could generate by swinging, throwing or using their best attack. In this case, it would be how hard a Spaniard could swing their sword or stab their pike.\nSpeed was something Leonel categorized as straight line running velocity.\nAgility encompassed both acceleration, speed in changing direction, and how quickly a person could use their weapon — how fast a sword swung, etc.\nCoordination was mostly hand-eye coordination. How precise a person was in using their strength, speed and agility. How accurate were the swings of their weapons. So on, and so forth.\nFinally, stamina was the most straight forward. How long could you maintain your optimal fighting strength?\nLeonel ranked all of these from a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 was having this ability completely crippled and 1 represented the pinnacle of the human race. This pinnacle was something Leonel used the limits of his own body to extrapolate and estimate.\nBy Leonel's estimates, an Olympic athlete of Earth would have a 0.5 in the category they needed the most for their event.\nAs for the Spaniards, they averaged about 0.4 in every category. And Leonel…\n[Strength: 0.67; Speed: 0.51; Agility: 0.55; Coordination: 0.82; Stamina: 0.63]\nAfter a few more weeks passed, Leonel felt it was necessary to add a sixth category: Reactions. Unexpectedly, it ended up being his highest 'stat', sitting at 0.91. This category not only encompassed reaction speed, but also factored in the instinctual movements battle experience gave you. Of course, most of the reason Leonel's Reaction was so high wasn't due to his experience, but because of his inhuman senses.\nLeonel found that when he broke down his opponents systematically with his self-created method, taking them down became even easier. He shamelessly targeted their weaknesses without remorse.\nFor those with great speed and agility, he overwhelmed them with strength. For those with great strength, he overwhelmed them with speed and agility. For those with great stamina, he left them to last, allowing them to tire themselves out first before he dealt the finishing blow.\nBefore Leonel realized it, he had grown numb to the slaughter. After breaking down their lives to mere numbers floating in his mind, it suddenly became easier to do what needed to be done. At the very least, it became easier to use the excuse that the Spanish committed terrible atrocities in this era to bury his guilt.\nEmboldened by his growing strength, Leonel began to assault the Spanish from within the temple and in the camps outside under the cover of dark.\nTheir numbers continued to fall quickly. Leonel had no idea how much time he had spent in this Sub-Dimensional Zone, but it was enough for the Spaniards to start calling him 'El Diablo'.\nHe might not have known much if any Spanish, but he definitely knew what that meant. It was a name that let his actions over the last months truly set in.\nHis numbness turned to cold.\nOn yet another seemingly monotonous day, a drastic change finally occurred. With the number of Spaniards drastically lowered, the Mayans holed up within the Sacrificial Room burst out, leading a mighty counter attack of their own.\nLeonel watched the battle play out from one of the few small windows he had found in the temple. He felt a wave of relief overcome him. Maybe he would be able to head home soon…\nBut, that was when another question struck him. Did he have a home to return to now?\nSighing, Leonel made his way through the network of hidden tunnels. A few had been found by the Spaniards in this time, but many of them were still intact.\nSlowly but surely, he finally entered the only floor he hadn't. Victory seemed close at hand, but Leonel knew that the Chief Priest was currently in the greatest danger now. He had led enough football comebacks to know that people were the most vulnerable when they believed victory was at hand. So, Leonel chose to watch silently behind a false wall.\nHe had found this tunnel long ago but had never exited it. There was no point. He couldn't communicate with the Mayans since he couldn't speak their language, so it was better if he helped from the shadows.\nBut, who knew that the first things Leonel would see was an old man with wrinkled brown skin, standing over the body of a youthful beauty who seemed to be trying her best not to cry.\nHer nude form could just barely be seen by Leonel, as could the knife the Chief Priest held high in the air as he chanted something he couldn't understand.\nLeonel was so stunned that his face drained of all color. That girl was about to die, and the reason she would was in part his fault. Had he not…\nNo, that didn't make sense. Wouldn't her fate at the hands of the Spaniards be even worse? Just forget it, they're not real people anyway. Just finish the quest.\nProtect the Chief Priest… Just protect the Chief Priest…\nBefore Leonel knew what he was doing, he had kicked down the false wall in a maddened rage. Guilt he had suppressed in his heart for months came spilling over in a bloody killing intent built from the deaths of hundreds of Spaniards.\nHis left arm reached into the container of long darts, his right gripping his atlatls as he hooked in his first attack.\n\"Die!\"\nThis was the first time in Leonel's life he truly wanted to kill. Even with Conrad, his intent hadn't truly been there.\nBut the result was far beyond his expectations. The chanting Priest turned toward him with a stunned expression, but reacted quickly, a barrier of something Leonel couldn't see appearing to block the piercing spear.\nLeonel stood frozen.\n[Chief Priest]\n[Strength: 0.12; Speed: 0.13; Agility: 0.15; Coordination: 0.42; Stamina: 0.33; Reactions: 0.73]\nNot only was the Priest's reaction the highest Leonel had ever seen aside from his own, it was the highest score Leonel had ever given, period. On top of this… Leonel suddenly felt that he was missing a seventh category…\nJust what was that wall of energy?",

      "content": "The Chief Priest wore a tall head guard, beautifully decorated in all sorts of bright feathers and fabrics. His chest was bare except for the cape that hung across his collarbone with finely polished jewels and precious metals. His lower body was covered by a skirt which first wrapped around him like a loin cloth before extending into two long pieces between his legs that stopped just below his knees.\nHe had no weapons aside from the crude sacrificial dagger that seemed formed of obsidian. However, he still felt like the most dangerous opponent he had ever come across.\nThe Priest began to speak words Leonel had no ability to understand. Still, the latter's nerves remained tight, whatever senses he had honed to this point being pushed to their upper limits. The strain even caused blood vessels in his eyes to burst, coloring his whites in red.\nWith little more hesitation, Leonel knocked another atlatls dart. This time he used more power, pulling back with as much as 50% of his strength.\nOut of habit, he hadn't gone all out with the first strike because the physical stats of the Priest were so low. But now he knew this wasn't a normal enemy.\nSeeing that his attempts at communication failed, the Priest's brows furrowed as he raised his dagger once more. But this time, he aimed it toward Leonel, chanting with a calm rhythm.\nThe nude young lady strapped to the table watched on blankly, her gaze, once filled with fear, turning dull. She seemed to believe that no matter how this all ended, her fate was already sealed.\nLeonel's spear shattered against an invisible barrier once more, but this time Leonel could faintly feel it condensing. It wasn't a feeling as sharp as his touch, sight or hearing, but it was there.\n'A sixth sense?'\nSuddenly, Leonel dropped down at his fastest speed. A moment later, a loud boom shook the Sacrificial Room's wall, leaving a deep impact.\nA cold sweat matted Leonel's back as he hopped up, sprinting to the side as he knocked another dart.\nHe dove forward, sliding his arm across the air sideways and causing another dart to whistle across the air with a sharp sound.\n'Dammit, I thought I would only have to fight normal humans in this place. Could it be that ancient humans found these awakened abilities too? Or maybe is it that these Sub-Dimensional Zones aren't as historically accurate as I originally believed?'\n[Anomaly detected… Recalculating…]\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone detected: Mayan Tomb. Spanish Invasion]\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone grade: C]\n[Clear requirements: Enter Chief Priest's Sacrificial Room (Complete). Save Chief Priest]\n[Side Quest: Unable to detect.

Scope of system too limited]\n[It is recommended that subject, Leonel Morales, complete this quest with a minimum of three other individuals. Subject's D-grade ability is too low]\nFor a moment, Leonel almost forgot his rage toward the Priest. He wanted nothing more than to throw this broken watch across the walls till it broke. How was this considered a system? How could it be anything other than a jumbled mess?\nInstead of telling him that he should enter in a team of 4, it waited until it was already too late to tell him. Instead of telling him what the side quests were, it waited until he had already completed them to tell him. And, it couldn't even get the grade of this Sub-Dimensional Zone right. What absolute bullshit.\n'Forget it! Focus.'\nLeonel's father's note told him that his father had to suppress his awakening during his youth. What if other people besides him had experienced this as well? The only problem with this theory was that his father had also said his constitution was different than others… But who was to say there weren't others like him?\nLeonel's dart was blocked once more, but his sharp senses caught the fact the Priest was forced to slide back, albeit a minuscule amount.\nWith a flip, Leonel took advantage of his own centrifugal force, landing on his feet and not losing a single dart carried on his back.\n'I only have 47 more darts. If I can't see any results by the time I have 25, I need to take the risk and get closer.'\nLeonel maintained his strength perfectly, never using more than 50%. He realized that this Priest was entirely reliant on his odd energy. The old man getting on in years didn't make any large movements. Aside from shifting his feet every so often to face Leonel and raising his arms, he did nothing else.\n'It can't be endless, I don't believe that he can do this forever.'\nSuddenly, Leonel felt a strong sense of danger from his back.\nImmediately he knew he had made a mistake. He dodged the Priest's last strike, but he hadn't heard a loud boom to his back like he had heard every time previously. He hadn't accounted for the possibility that the Priest could control the trajectory of his attacks!\nLeonel managed to leap out of the way just in time, but his pack of long darts didn't survive.\nThe sound of splintering wood followed the ugly expression Leonel wore. Just like that, the 40 some odd darts he had left were shattered to pieces, leaving the Priest grinning an ugly yellow toothed smile.\nLeonel sprung upward a moment later, running for his life.\nWithout having to divert his attention toward Leonel's darts, the Priest completely unleashed his strength.\nLeonel dodged like a mad man sprinting around the room as though he was on a racetrack and not in a temple. His mind spun trying to think of solutions.\n'First important point, every strike takes 2 seconds to charge and fire. Second important point, it only seems possible to control one strike at once. Controlled strikes take 5 seconds to charge but can be prepared as lesser strikes are being fired. However, a normal energy strike cannot be formed while the controlled strike is being maneuvered.\n'Third important point, these strikes carry a strength of 0.82. I should adjust his strength before I figure out how to rank this seventh category. The speed of these energy strikes is at 0.89. The agility of the controlled strikes are only at 0.46.\n'If I want to keep surviving, I need to dodge before he sends out his strike or I'm finished. Luckily I've overestimated the Priest's coordination. If his control over his energy strikes are factored in, it's dropped by 0.03 to 0.39.'\nLeonel continued to run, taking out three silver rods he had strapped to his left hip and twisting them together, discarding his atlatl completely.\nIn a smooth motion, he shrugged off what remained of the box of darts, leaving about 20 pounds behind.\nGripping his silver rod, Leonel abruptly changed directions. The moment he ducked the most recent controlled energy strike, he leaped into the air toward the Chief Priest, his silver rod morphing into a bicycle before he landed on the ground.\nThe Priest was stunned for a moment. Where could he had ever seen such technology? Luckily for Leonel, his silver rod worked with folding technology and not electrical technology, or it would have lost its morphing ability long ago.\nThe Sacrificial Room was quite large, being about 200 meters in diameter. The distance between Leonel and the Priest was currently just over a hundred meters. Even if he ran full tilt, it would still take him over nine seconds to make it. However, with some momentum built up and his bike, he could cut it to eight.\n'One second… two!'\nLeonel tilted his bike to the side so far that his knee scrapped against the ground. Sparks flew as the metal fitting he placed over it skid.\nWith an abnormal feat of strength, Leonel slammed his palm into the ground, pushing himself and his bike back upright. He had fought with his life on the line for too long to feel the same shuddering nervousness. There had been nothing but him and his own thoughts for months. There was no way he was going to lose to the first person he consciously chose to kill.\n'The next strike will very likely target my bike itself… two!'\nLeonel's thighs flexed, his bike hopping just over meter in the air. His instincts from countless battles kicked in. All things considered, only having to account for just one opponent at a time was marginally easier despite the godlike abilities of this Priest.\n'Here it comes.'\nThe controlled strike finished charging, shooting toward Leonel like a bullet.\nVaguely formed in Leonel's head, he could see the difference almost as though they were vibrant colors of their own. His eyes were slowly gaining the ability to see the shifting energy through the air, the pale fog circulating around the Priest.\nMaybe if this was really a game and not real life, Leonel would get a notification achievement about awakening this level of sight before even gaining mastery over the energy.\nThe energy sped toward him. But this time, it was no longer a vague feeling Leonel got. He could see it cutting through the air from his right, curving for his head while slicing down in an arching path.\nIf Leonel jumped, it would destroy his bike. If he ducked it would take off his head.\nThe Priest likely realized that Leonel was previously only able to get a vague sense of where his energy was coming from due to the fact Leonel had taken more drastic actions than what was necessary.\nNot only did he start taking control of the energy strike before it met Leonel this time, but he also actively dissipated its energy, trying to confuse Leonel about its exact location.\nUnfortunately, the Priest could have never imagined that Leonel's senses would evolve once more at this very moment. Even more unfortunately, Leonel was well aware how low the agility of the controlled energy strike was.\nLeonel suddenly skidded his bike to a grinding halt, the tail of his back wheel spinning to the front and whipping around.\nHis maneuver was perfectly timed. The controlled strike sped by his right side across his face and out into the distance toward the left.\nThe Priest's eyes widened as he quickly tried to control the energy strike to turn back, but Leonel's bike had already finished its spin and furiously sped forward. Though in a straight line the energy strike had a speed of 0.89 and Leonel's speed was only 0.51, there were two important factors Leonel had already considered.\nFirst, the time it took for the energy strike to slow, turn around, then gain its top speed once more was long due to its low agility. And, second… Leonel's speed on his bike obviously just wasn't a mere 0.51 anymore.\nThe Priest was too late to realize this. Leonel was already 2 seconds away and he still hadn't abandoned his controlled energy strike. He didn't have enough time to prepare another strike.\nIn a panic, the Priest grabbed the naked girl on the table and threw her toward Leonel who had just unsheathed a sword.\nShocked, Leonel squeezed the hand-breaks of his bike as hard as he could catching the girl in the air.\n'Dammit!'\nAnalyzing the situation, Leonel knew his time sensitive plan was ruined. He also realized something else. The Priest's strength was too low to throw a girl who must have weighed at least 110 pounds across 10 meters to him. That meant the Priest had another method of amplifying the strength of his body directly.\nIn that instant, the Priest's strength stat rose to… 0.97!\n'The Priest still doesn't know I attacked him to protect this girl. If he knows this, he'll use it against me.'\nLeonel recovered from his apprehension quickly, battle instincts he had honed for months kicking in as he apologetically dropped the girl to the ground without hesitation. It might have been cruel, but a drop of a less than a meter was better than whatever attack she would have to suffer from the Priest otherwise.\nHis plan worked just as intended. The Priest completely ignored the girl, believing that Leonel wouldn't care about her life one way or another. However, by now, he had already prepared another strike.\nLeonel clicked the button on his bike, turning it back into a pole and rolling out of the way.\nIt was already too late to build up momentum with his bike again, he had to cross the last few meters himself.",

      "content": "Leonel's senses were like sparks running through his body. He could feel his Reactions increase again, reaching 0.93.\nWith another dodge, he entered the two meter radius of the Priest, swinging downward with all his might.\n'His controlled strikes are interrupted when he has to form a shield… But if the shield is made, it can sustain itself for a period while he creates the next…!'\nA sharp reverberating strength traveled through Leonel's body as his silver rod violently crashed against the Priest's barrier. It was painful, but his body was resistant. The glow in his eyes only grew fiercer when he saw the barrier give way a bit.\nThe Priest's next shot was at point blank range, but Leonel's reactions were too quick. The former's arm had only barely twitched when Leonel shifted his body, dodging the next strike.\nAt such a close distance, the controlled shots had become meaningless. With their poor agility, if Leonel timed a dodge well enough, the Priest could end up hurting himself.\n'He can only shoot these strikes of energy from the hand wielding his dagger. But is that true? Or is it superstition? When he threw the girl over, he clearly used a hand without the dagger in it…'\nThe Priest's arm suddenly shot forward. Maybe believing that his shield would be down soon, he preemptively struck, his strength soaring past his base stats once again.\nBut Leonel was ready. With the Priest's poor coordination, catching Leonel off guard was too tall a mountain to climb. At the same time, however, the Priest was more clever than Leonel gave him credit for.\nThe instant his arm punched toward Leonel, another strike of energy was sent forth. Except this time, there was no two second wait like Leonel was expecting.\nCaught completely off guard, Leonel's eyes widened in shock. In those split seconds, he managed to tell that the strike was shooting forward at a speed of 0.94 and it was completely impossible for him to dodge.\n'That dagger… it can charge and store attacks too… Shit.'\nLeonel managed to shift his shoulder out of the way of the Priest's punch, but the flash of energy barreled into his left hip, treating Leonel's armor like scrap metal and fracturing his hip bone before its strength dissipated.\nA cold breath rushed through Leonel's teeth as he spun like a top. He had never felt such excruciating pain in his lifetime. He was certain that the him of just a few months ago would blackout in an instant.\n'… If he has another one…'\nLeonel's heart trembled. But luckily, even with his vision growing foggy, he could sense the Priest gathering energy once more. Whether it was because his dagger's ability had a timer, or because he didn't feel it was necessary to use it again, or maybe because he couldn't, it didn't matter.\nWith a wince, Leonel collapsed to the ground, but he had already pulled out another atlatl.\nAll this time, the Priest had completely forgotten about his ability to throw. How could he not, Leonel made a big show of throwing his atlatl away as though it was useless to him. Those action made the Priest completely miss the fact that Leonel had three more to his right hip. And just now, he just so happened to have landed by one of the darts the Priest blocked when he first entered this place.\nAs for whether it was by coincidence or not… If someone asked his best friend James… He would emphatically choose not.\nLeonel took control of his senses, forcefully sealing the pain in his hip from traveling to his brain.\nRolling over, he plucked the damaged dart from the ground and fitted it into his atlatl.\nBy the time the Priest noticed that something was wrong, it was already too late. He was in the middle of conjuring another energy strike and he would have to cancel it in order to form a shield. But that singular second was all Leonel needed.\nWith a roar that expelled every drop of energy he had left, Leonel balanced himself on his only good hip and butt, angling his torso up as he finally threw his first full force spear toward the Priest.\nThe speed was blinding. It was as though a line of brown had been drawn from Leonel's arm to the Priest's neck. The splintered wood of the dart lodged into the latter's throat, causing a fountain of blood to rain down as the Priest collapsed, his dagger falling along with him.\nSeeing this, the last bit of will that held Leonel together collapsed. He fell back, a familiar pain returning to his left hip that almost made his eyes roll back.\nHe knew he couldn't stay. The Mayans had gone out to fight, but there was no telling when they'd be back. He needed to move.\n'Has the quest ended? Send me out of here.'\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone detected: Mayan Tomb. Spanish Invasion]\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone grade: C]\n[Clear requirements: Enter Chief Priest's Sacrificial Room (Complete). Save Chief Priest (Failed)]\n'Oh for fuck's sake. It can't be that they won't teleport me out because I failed, right?'\nIf he had the strength, he would definitely smash this watch now regardless of the consequences.\nBreathing heavily, Leonel rolled to his right again. He found his silver rod to his side and gripped it. Using it as a crutch, he slowly pulled himself up, relying on his one good leg.\nHe slowly made his way to the dead Priest, pulling the fallen dagger to his side and wasting what must have been at least a good ten minutes picking it up. He didn't know how it worked, or if he could even use it, but he knew it held some power in the eyes of the Mayans without a doubt. Maybe if they came rushing here, he could scare them away with it.\nFinally, Leonel hobbled to the still naked girl who sat dazed on the ground. Now that the fight was over, his teenage hormones seemed to want to kick in. She was truly a beauty with delicate brown skin, though it was now covered in bruises and scrapes. She should have been around 20 years old, so though she was young, she still held a maturity to her that too easily swayed boys as young as Leonel.\nHowever, Leonel snapped out of it, trying his best to avert his eyes from her most treasured places though she didn't seem to care anymore.\n\"Are you alright?\" Leonel asked.\nThe moment he did, he started kicking himself. She couldn't understand a word he was saying, what the hell was wrong with him? If Aina saw him babbling like a fool here, she'd never talk to him again.\nThe young woman seemed to shake out of her daze, looking up at Leonel from her seated position as though shocked he was before her. Still, what shocked her even more was his kind gaze. She hadn't seen such a thing in a long while. Even her own parents had only looked toward her with sadness and grief after they learned she was the chosen virgin for the Chief Priest's sacrifice.\nThough Leonel's face was mostly obscured by his metal helmet, it was still the best she had seen in a long time.\nShe reentered her daze for another long while as she recalled what happened. Looking toward the Priest's dead body, her body suddenly started to tremble.\nHer breath quickened, her breasts undulating beneath the far too fast beating of her heart.\nLeonel snapped out of his embarrassment and bent down with a worried expression.\n\"It's alright, you'll be fine now.\"\nLeonel knew she couldn't understand him. But he hoped that a soothing voice would do something.\nHowever… What he didn't expect was for his heart to stop beating completely when her gaze met his own next.\nIt was an inhuman gaze. A reddish, devilish stare that looked like a madwoman intent on seeing the world burn.\nShe shrieked, lunging at Leonel's neck with both hands. No matter how quick Leonel's reflexes, with almost one half of his body being completely useless, and with how close the two were, there was absolutely nothing he could do.\nA sharp pain shook Leonel's body as he fell to his back. The breath was knocked out of him as he gasped in shock. But he noticed a second later that he couldn't breathe. His throat was completely sealed by this seemingly frail girl.\nShe was almost like a rabid dog, snarling and screaming as she squeezed with all her might. It was as though the only wish she had in this world was for Leonel to die.\nLeonel was in shock. Hadn't he just saved her? What was she doing? Even if she didn't thank him, she shouldn't be trying to kill him, right?\nLeonel's eyes reddened both due to a lack of oxygen and a slowly building anger. He didn't have to step out and save her life. In fact, his quest didn't ask him to anyway.\nBecause of her, months of toil and pain were completely wasted, yet she was trying to kill him? How dare she?!\nHis silver rod and the dagger still gripped in either arm, all Leonel had to do was drive the dagger into her ribcage. Just like that, she would be dead and he could breathe again.\nHis hand raised, his emotions bubbling over, but that was when his gaze met hers again.\nHe could see them. The tears falling from her eyes, the sheer desperation. He could even faintly see the glint of his knife in the corner of her eye, something that made him certain she saw it. All she had to do was drive her knee into his shattered hip and he would probably lose himself to pain, unable to do much of anything.\nYet she did nothing. It was as though she was hoping he would just end her life.\nLeonel felt his vision blackening, his dagger still raised in the air. His hand trembled… He knew that her delicate skin wouldn't be able to last even a split moment against the sharp edge of the blade, yet he couldn't bring himself to do it.\nHis hand fell back to the ground, his body finally succumbing to his injuries and lack of oxygen. As his consciousness faded, he could only see a sea of black.\n'Maybe this is just what I deserve…'\n[Side Quest: Defeat 1000 Spaniards (Complete) … Reward pending]\nIn his last moments, this was what he thought of.\n'Defeat'. What a nice way to put it. In reality, he had slaughtered them all.\nWere they fake? Leonel could no longer fool himself into believing this. The emotions that colored that girl's eyes… They were too real. He could almost peer into her soul and see through her secrets, her insecurities… How could they be fake?\n'Oh, today's my 18th birthday…' Leonel thought. '… I guess I'm an adult now, right? You don't have to feel bad about my death then, dad… you officially finished raising me… I'm no longer… your responsibility…'\nLeonel no longer had the strength to form anymore thoughts. So, he slipped away.\nThe naked girl sat over his torso in a daze, looking from Leonel's handsome face and to the dagger he hadn't used and back again. Now that his helm had been knocked off in his fall backward, she could see him clearly. She was stunned to find that he was even younger than she was.\nThe tears that fell from her cheeks grew into a torrent, her savage shrieks turning to maddening sobs until she collapsed, unconscious.\nIt was then that a white light enveloped Leonel and his body disappeared.\n[Quest cleared. Subject Leonel Morales being sent to —]\nThe wrist watch's mechanical voice cut off. Clearly, wherever Leonel was headed, it had no ability to exist.",

      "content": "Leonel was beginning to see a new pattern in his life that he wasn't very fond of.\nBattle to the point of death. Fall unconscious. And finally, wake up without knowing where the hell you were.\nOnce again, Leonel found himself in a similar situation. Except this time, it was even weirder than appearing atop a Mayan temple, if you could believe it.\nHe sat on the ground, or what he perceived was the ground, in a blank white space. If it wasn't for some kind of gravity telling him which way was down, he would have a hard time distinguishing just which direction was which.\nTo make matters weirder, it was hard to tell if the ceiling was a centimeter from his head, or if it was miles away. Was there even a ceiling? He wasn't sure.\nHowever, maybe it was due to his ability, but Leonel found that he adapted quite quickly. Soon, that feeling of disorientation faded and he began to slowly stand with the help of his silver rod.\n'Hold on…'\nJust when Leonel was feeling that the process was too easy, he realized that his hip was no longer broken. In fact, he felt better than he ever had in his entire life. The only discomfort he felt in his hip was due to his deformed armor pressing into it.\nWithout much of a choice, Leonel took it off. He wasn't sure where he was, and equally unsure if he still needed to be alert. But, this armor was no longer any good to him in this state.\n'Wait… Why am I alive? Unless… I'm not?'\nThis sort of white space, wasn't it just like every stereotype of heaven he had ever read about? Maybe he really was already dead.\nLeonel sighed. After unbuckling his armor, he set it aside. He really did smell quite terrible, but after so many months, it had stopped bothering him as much. His sweat pants and compression shirts hadn't lasted, so he was currently wearing so odd leather pants he snatched from a dead soldier. His chest was fitted with chain mail, but other than that, it was bare.\nTo sum it up, he was a mess.\n'My scars seem to be gone too…'\nThe number Leonel had accumulated were definitely not few. His body had become a canvas of bullet wounds and blade scars, but they had vanished.\n\"Oh? It's quite rare for someone to regain their bearing so quickly in this place.\"\nThe sudden voice snapped Leonel out of his own thoughts. His tension still running high, his neck practically broke off from his torso turning toward the sound, his silver rod and dagger being gripped tightly.\n\"Whoa there. It wouldn't be the first time someone attacked their Guardian, but I'd prefer not to be added to that list, please and thanks.\"\nA handsome man that seemed carved of precious stone had appeared a few meters from Leonel. He was more perfect than any human should have been. Leonel had a hard time believing that he was anything other than an ascended being. He somehow managed to wear a gold plated armor without looking absolutely ridiculous to a man of the modern era like Leonel.\n\"Guardian?\"\n\"Mm, yes.\" The man said. \"It's my job to hand you the rewards you've earned in your Sub-Dimensional Zone. In return, I receive a bit of Karma.\"\n\"Karma?\"\nThe man waved his hand. \"Guiding a baby isn't part of my job description.\"\nWith that, the man unfurled a golden scroll. Maybe it was due to whatever it is he read, but he froze for a very long time.\n'He seemed to be speaking English, but his lip movements were nothing like English. Something is translating?' Leonel thought to himself.\n\"First to clear a Sub-Dimensional Zone in your world, huh? Not bad… Oh, that's unfortunate. It seems that someone skipped ahead and took the World Spirit for themselves, or else you'd have a right to a fourth of it. Shame, your world has Eighth Dimension potential, its World Spirit should have great talent… Not bad, a Third Dimensional world that can create rudimentary Sub-Dimensional Zone analysis technology definitely has a bright future ahead of it.\n\"Just who could… Oh?\" The man's brows raised as though he saw something amusing. \"Is Morales your maternal or paternal name?\"\n\"… Paternal.\"\n\"I see… I see…\"\n\"Excuse me, sir. Are you saying that my reward should have been this World Spirit but someone else took it?\"\n\"You could say so. But it's less about the World Spirit being taken away and more about it choosing its master. You shouldn't feel that it's unfair, it can only be said that this person is more gifted than you are. Or rather… That's not definitive. After all, this World Spirit was taken even before you were born.\n\"Also, being the first only nets you a reward of a chance to gain the World Spirit's recognition and the equivalent of a fourth of its power. Many worlds still have the power of their World Spirit split into four, passed down through generations of the same Clan… Not that that matters much to you, now.\"\n\"Oh, I see…\"\n\"… Entering a Tier 4 Black Ranked Sub-Dimensional Zone on your own for your first try? With a pseudo Fourth Dimensional world's constitution for a body? You must be insane.\"\nLeonel opened his mouth to answer, but he couldn't make heads or tails of what the man just said. His watch ranked the world he entered a grade 'C'. How did that translate to this man's ranking system?\n\"It was a Tier 4 Black Ranked Zone meant for four people? What the hell is wrong with you kid? No wonder it took so long for me to fix you up. Leave these kinds of things to youths born in higher Dimensional worlds. It's my job not to be prejudiced against you, but I'm giving you advice. Your world has a lot of potential, more than mine by a good margin. Take your time and stop rushing things.\"\nLeonel was shocked by the care in the man's voice. It seemed out of place… Or maybe he was just a good guy, or was just fond of his accomplishments.\nBut, he could still only smile bitterly at the man's words. He hadn't known anything before he stepped in. Plus, his father had implied that he should enter. How could he know his old man would send him to his death?\n\"… Alright, I'll stop nagging you.\"\n\"Sir, can I ask your name?\"\n\"My name is Montez.\"\n\"Thanks for the advice, Uncle Montez. I'll do my best.\"\nMontez blinked in shocked for a long while before he laughed heartily.\n\"Uncle it is, then… Hm, your rewards…\n\"Clearing both side quests. Activating the hidden quest. Completing the hidden quest. Clearing the objective.\"\n\"I cleared the objective?.. I thought I failed…\"\n\"You would have, had you killed that little girly. But it seemed you didn't.\"\nLeonel's face twisted with a weird expression. What kind of quest was that? Wouldn't it go on forever then?\n\"The quest objective was to repel the Spanish and save the girl.\"\nLeonel's expression darkened. The wrist watch told him to save the Chief Priest. What kind of sick joke was this?\nHad he known the true objective, he wouldn't have gone into the Sacrificial Room without a plan because he would of deduced the Priest would be his toughest enemy. If he was prepared, he wouldn't have ended up in such a sorry state.\nMontez began to laugh, eventually wiping tears from his eyes.\n\"I told you it was rudimentary Zone analysis technology. How could it be completely accurate?\"\nLeonel took a deep breath. \"Before my rewards, do you mind explaining two things to me? What exactly are Sub-Dimensional Zones and how does the ranking system work?\"\n\"Well, I'm normally not allowed to explain these things… But I think I can get away with it this time.\n\"Zones are key points in history which connect your Third Dimension to the Fourth. Due to a sort of buffer the Universe has, these Dimensions were 'stored' in time so that they couldn't influence the timeline too much. In order for your world to successfully evolve to the next Dimension, these instances in time must be resolved.\n\"If they are not resolved, they will begin eating away at your timeline, altering important events in history until your world is unrecognizable. If the problem becomes severe enough, your world could collapse.\"\nLeonel's eyes widened. He hadn't expected the problem to be this severe.\n\"So I'm guessing… the reason why you higher worlds help us little guys out is so that one day you'll have more help with clearing your own Sub-Dimensional Zones?\"\nMontez couldn't hide his mouth hanging open in shock.\n\"… Yes… That's exactly right. It's in our best interest to unite in this matter. A world with as much potential as yours will receive a lot of help. In fact, there should be a lot of influences from other worlds in your own already… You're quite a smart boy, but I really can't say much else. Influencing your timeline too much can have its own poor effects.\n\"To answer your second question, Black Zones are assigned to Fourth Dimensional events, Bronze to Fifth, Silver to Sixth, and Gold to Seventh. My own world is only of the Seventh Dimension, so I don't know much more.\"\nLeonel had many more questions. Like the man had mentioned 'world potential' before, and even said that Earth had the potential of an Eighth Dimensional World. On top of that, he said that Earth had more potential than his own world. But if that was the case, and his world was already of the Seventh Dimension, shouldn't his world's job be done? Since there was no hope in reaching the Eighth Dimension for them, why did they still help lower worlds?\nAnd if his job wasn't finished for some unknown reason, wouldn't his Seventh Dimensional World be facing Eighth Sub-Dimensional Zones right now just like Earth as a Third Dimensional World was facing Fourth Sub-Dimensional threats? So why did he not know anything about Zones above the Gold grade?\nThere seemed to be a secret here that was nagging at Leonel's heart. But… He knew better than to ask.\n\"Each rank of Black to Gold is divided into nine level, one being the lowest and nine being the highest difficulty. In addition, the chosen difficulty is ranked by how many are allowed to enter as well. The Zone you completed had an entry limit of four since it was relatively stable and could support that much influence without collapsing. But, you completed it alone, so it was more like a Tier 5 Black Zone to you.\"\nMontez clapped. \"Alright, that's enough. I wasted much of our time together with too many words.\n\"I'm sure you know by now that the reward system is separate from the Zones. It's something us higher worlds created. Only Silver and Gold Zones can form rewards of their own, kind of like that dagger in your hand… Though that dagger will disappear once you leave this place. That's the difference between low grade Zones and higher grade ones.\"\nLeonel couldn't help but inwardly smile. Every time Montez swore he couldn't tell Leonel anymore, he would continue to drop tidbits of helpful information.\n\"Either way, since this is a four person Zone, you can normally choose four Tier 4 Black rewards for a minimum clear. But, since you completed the hidden quest, that's good for a Tier 5 Black reward. Including the two side quests… the clearing 100 Spaniards reward is another Tier 4 Black reward, clearing 1000 is a Tier 5 Black reward.\n\"I also have to factor in the fact you were the first of your world to clear a Zone, and that's worth a Tier 9 Black reward. So, five Tier 4 Black rewards, two Tier 5 Black rewards, and one Tier 9 Black reward.\n\"You are allowed to trade down by handing in a higher Tier for three lower ones. You can trade up by using five. Don't ask why it's like this, you know people at the top are misers.\"\nMontez clapped his hands. A moment later, a counter filled with treasures Leonel was practically blinded by appeared. Maybe the most shocking part was the fact this 'counter' extended for hundreds of meters to the left and right.",

      "content": "Leonel was overwhelmed. How could he possibly sift through so many treasures?\n\"What do you suggest, Uncle Montez?\"\nMontez smiled. \"First, I don't suggest you trade in your five Tier 4 Black rewards for a Tier 5 one. In your current state, you can't afford to be picky. If you have to rely on 'treasures' you pick up in the Zones you enter, you won't last very long.\n\"In addition, as I said before, the things you picked up from there will disappear once you leave this place. In this present state, not only are Zones dangerous, but your world itself is dangerous too. You might have run into the Invalids already…\"\nLeonel opened his mouth to answer but only nodded in the end. He had almost forgotten about the weird changes in his white pupil'd peers… So they were called Invalids. He didn't have to think much to understand why that was.\nUnfortunately, he was running out of time, so he knew he couldn't ask Montez about it. It also seemed that Montez was purposely not answering as well.\n\"Do you have the ability to narrow these down by my needs?\" Leonel asked.\nAfter seeing Montez nod, he immediately organized his thoughts.\n\"How would you categorize these treasures?\"\n\"Hm. There are defensive treasures that range from armors to one time use tokens. There are offensive treasures that range from weapons to, again, one time use tokens. There are techniques that touch on anything from improving your strength to your defense to your offense.\n\"You can trade for Sub-Dimension Zone analyzing treasures to get a more accurate read on the Zones you enter. These are categorized as detection treasures, the best ones can be used outside of Zones as well.\n\"You can also trade for information. It can be information about where Zones will appear in your world, or even information about other worlds. It's also possible to buy a ticket to another world, though it would cost you your Tier 9 Black reward.\"\nLeonel's eyes flashed with a sharp light.\n\"Can you show me your Tier 9 Black techniques? Preferably the ones that teach how to use the same energy as the Priest I just fought.\"\n\"Hohoho.\" Montez smiled a smile that wasn't a smile, but his eyes seemed to give away that he was extremely satisfied with Leonel's choice.\nThe counter magically shrunk down, leaving a pile of hundreds of booklets. It was clear at a glance that though a Tier 9 Black technique was valuable to Leonel now, it definitely didn't mean much to Montez.\nThough the options were narrowed down, Leonel still felt lost. If only his sensory type abilities were able to seek out what he needed.\nAt this thought, Leonel raised an internal eyebrow. What if it could? He didn't know anything about his abilities currently and he was actually tempted to ask for a treasure that could tell him about it. But, he subconsciously felt that this wasn't the best idea.\nOne thing that was clear to him about these treasures is that none of them were perfect. He most certainly couldn't expect a Black grade treasure to be so. If he found such a 'helpful' treasure, it might lead him down the wrong path. And, even if it was correct, it might limit him by boxing in his thinking.\nLeonel closed his eyes, trying to tap into the same sixth sense he used to battle the Priest. Once he locked onto that feeling once more, his eyes flashed opened. In that moment, the seemingly ordinary piles of books became a violent storm of raging colors.\nNo. Once again, they weren't truly colors. Leonel's mind only interpreted them as such, almost like an odd form of synesthesia.\nLeonel realized now that compared to these books, the Priest had been a joke. But this made sense, he was only the 'Boss' of a Tier 4 Black Zone, while these were Tier 9 Black techniques.\nHowever, he soon found differences between them. Among even these high tier techniques, there were separations. Leonel immediately discarded the worst of them and focused on the five that shone so brightly that even while being buried beneath the pile, they exposed themselves.\nHe stepped forward and pushed all the other away, leaving five.\n'Shit… I can't read what —'\nJust as Leonel was thinking this, the words on the five thin booklets rearranged themselves, becoming legible English.\n\"There's still a small bit of fairness in the world.\" Montez laughed, hiding his shock. \"Anything you take out of this world will remain translated for you.\"\nLeonel nodded, thankful.\n\"I pick this one.\"\nAt this point, even Montez was stunned to the point of no longer being able to hide his reactions. Leonel hadn't deliberated for more than a split second before he put his hand over a booklet, taking it from the counter.\nLeonel shrugged. \"I felt this one could help improve my ability. I had already chosen before I knew its name.\"\n\"[Dimensional Cleanse]… It can indeed improve one's ability. But how did you know that?\"\n\"I dunno. Just felt it.\"\nMontez's eyes narrowed. He could tell that Leonel wasn't lying. But, even if he was, Montez wouldn't press him regardless.\n\"The others are powerful as well, so why this one in particular?\"\n\"They gave me auxiliary abilities I didn't need. Before I think of gaining extra stuff, I want to focus on my own. I feel that it's very powerful.\"\nMontez couldn't refute. He had never seen someone with a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional Constitution do what Leonel just did.\n\"For my two Tier 5 Black rewards, can you show me some flexible armors?\"\nLeonel wanted to look through [Dimensional Cleanse] now, but he refrained. He felt that Montez had reminded him about the time for a reason. He likely couldn't stay here forever.\nMontez clapped his hands once more, causing the counter to shift. This time, there were even more items to display. Not only were there more, but they also took up a larger space individually than small booklets did. In addition, it was a lower tier of treasure, so it made sense that there were so many.\nLeonel narrowed down the options in the same fashion. He eventually settled on a skin-tight armor not much different from his compression shirt. It was a sleek black and the only difference was the fact it was dotted with small hexagons that flashed an imperceptible black light every so often.\nFor his second Tier 5 treasure, Leonel chose a pair of shoes that had the ability to camouflage themselves into his chosen design. Not only did it have a small bit of defense, but it could increase his speed and agility by 0.1 each.\nWhen Leonel got to his Tier 4 treasures, he realized why Montez advised him not to trade them in. He could think of so many things he needed that he almost felt depressed that there were just five choices left.\nFirst, he chose a container. It was shaped like box forged of steel, but it had thick leather straps. Its height was about a meter and its width about half of one. From the outside, it seemed to have less carrying capacity than the wooden box Leonel used in the Mayan Temple. But one would be shocked to find that it could house 200 long-form darts compared to 50 from the Mayan container. In addition, as long as Leonel hovered his hand over it, a dart would immediately enter his palm.\nThe best part about this treasure was that it could produce darts itself. It came pre-made with 200, but as long as Leonel fed it materials, it could make more. Leonel was extremely happy finding such a perfect treasure for him.\nThe second Tier 4 Black treasure he took was another technique. This one was called [Call of the Wind]. It was a throwing technique that taught the use of wind negating abilities to increase the speed of one's spears or darts.\nThe third Leonel chose was a sturdier atlatl. The combination of these higher tech darts and this technique would completely shatter the atlatls the Mayans built. Plus, everything he got from the temple would disappear once he left this place anyway.\nThe fourth Leonel chose was a crude sensor. It could sense the opening of a Zone within ten miles and also point out the direction like a compass. In addition, with a large margin of error, it could estimate the grade of the Zone as well.\nThe fifth and final treasure Leonel chose wasn't for himself. It was a bracelet that acted as a one time defensive token. Though it was a Tier 4 Black treasure, since it was only one time use, it was more powerful than other treasures of its tier.\nOf course, he had traded for it for the sake of Aina.\nHe may have not known the details of Aina's likes and dislikes, but he knew of her disposition. If he tried to give her too much, Leonel was certain she would reject. But this small token… Maybe she just might say yes.\n\"Uh… Uncle Montez…\"\n\"Hm? What're you loitering around for. That was your final pick.\"\n\"… Do you maybe have a place I can wash myself in? I can't see my… I can't see her like this, it'll be a disaster.\"\nMontez looked blankly at Leonel before almost falling over in laughter.\n\"Sure, sure, sure. Whatever. Since you were so quick, you have fifteen minutes left.\"\nMontez waved his hand and the counter disappeared, replaced by a small pond of water that fogged with a dense whiteness.\nLeonel didn't hesitate. They were all men here anyway. He stripped off all his worn armor and dropped them to the ground, jumping in to scrub himself furiously. He was so obsessed with getting as clean as possible that he completely missed Montez's sharpening gaze at the sight of the faint scar on his right hip. And since he missed that… He also missed the surge of fury.\nAs for Leonel, it wasn't really his fault that he missed this. The pond was much too comfortable. He forgot the joy of cleaning oneself. But, even more curious, this water didn't seem to be normal by any stretch of the imagination. Leonel could even faintly feel his senses sharpening.\nBy the end of ten minutes, his Reactions had increased to 0.95 before stopping. In addition, his coordination followed suit, stopping at 0.90.\nWith just five minutes left, Leonel hopped out. He slid on his new Tier 5 Black flexible armor first, allowing it to perfectly adjust to his size and shape. He felt his stamina tick up by 0.05. Then, he slipped on his raggedy pair of sweatpants that he had luckily cleaned first this time. Though they had been soggy, Montez was nice enough to wave a hand and dry them clean.\nThere were a lot of holes in them, but at least they covered his most important parts.\nLast came his pair of Tier 5 Black shoes which he disguised as sneakers. He then slid on the steel container and hooked his white boned atlatl to his waist.\nGripping the rest of his stuff, he bowed his head in thanks to Montez.\n\"Thank you, Uncle Montez!\"\nMontez smiled and waved, sending Leonel out.\n**\nOn the top of the Mayan temple, the situation was completely different to how Leonel had left it. Not only had his friends woken up, but judging by their appearances and how there were fewer of them than before, they had also cleared their first Zone as well…\nMontez had downplayed how long he took to recover Leonel back to his full state. If Leonel's constitution had been better, he could have healed him in an instant. But due to Leonel's weak body, Montez had to take his time.\nLike this, though Leonel was the first to clear a Zone, he was actually last in place to return. Maybe only the first few people who awoke knew that he had entered first…\n\"What the hell are you trying to do, Conrad?\"\nJames stood towering, his injuries from that night clearly healed. But it seemed that he was still in quite a bad state, a reality that would have left Leonel surprised. Why had his Guardian healed him but not James?\nHowever, a moment later Leonel would realize that it was because James had been hurt outside of the Zone!\nConrad sneered. \"This isn't the normal world order anymore, James. Just because you were bigger and stronger than me before, doesn't mean you are now. I won't need you to be drunk to kill you this time.\"\n\"You have a lot of nerve puffing your chest out like that after sneak attacking me in my sleep. Sure, it's a new world order. But you're still the same pussy.\"\nConrad's gaze turned crimson, the space around him heating furiously.\n\"You wanna say that again? Even if it's a new world order, your family still exists on the outside. And don't think I've forgotten what you failed to do during the Championship Game.\"\nJames' own gaze turned dangerous. \"If you died here, who of the Siegfried family would even know or care? If you think I'm just going to let you use the girls of my Royal Blue Academy just to vent your lust, you have another thing coming.\"\nSeveral girls sat cowering to James' back, their eyes filled with fear. They realized that in this world, they didn't have the same protections they once did… Among them, Yuri and Savahn were present, but there was no sign of Aina.\nAs though on cue, a portal slowly formed. A delicate beauty with a battle axe twice the size of her body appeared. Her presence was so captivating that it was almost too easy to ignore the weapon on her back and the odd out of place black bag in her hand.\nAina's steps paused, her gaze sweeping over the surroundings only to stop on Yuri and Savahn. Looking at the tears that streaked their faces and their disheveled clothing, her gaze once more shifted to Conrad.\nAt that moment, another portal appeared.\nConrad's expression turned ugly when he saw Leonel's smiling face. He was shocked to see how many items Leonel had brought with him. How had he gotten so much?\nAina, too, saw Leonel. In fact, her gaze didn't leave Leonel's as she walked to Conrad's back.\nHer arm shot forward, piercing through to Conrad's chest. The image of a petite girl with an arm covered in blood was an image Leonel would never forget.\nHe had been smiling brightly just a moment ago, his eyes finally landing on the beauty he had been thinking of for so long… Only for it to freeze in his shock.\nConrad didn't get to speak another word before he slumped to the ground, sliding off of Aina's forearm as though she deliberately slowed him down so that Leonel would capture every moment.\nLeonel felt that his world had come to a complete grinding halt.\n---\nAlright guys, this will be the last mass upload for a while. DD's regular upload schedule will be 1 chapter or 2k words a day. However, there are ways to get more chapters:\nFor every 10 *unique* reviews (ie by a different person and not spammed from the same account), I will add a bonus chapter. We are at 2 reviews right now, 1 review exluding myself. So, when we get to 11 total, I will upload another chapter. This deal is good for up to 101 total reviews :) we probably won't get there any time soon, though.\nI also plan to implement a powerstone bonus chapter system, but I'll let you guys know about that at a later date.\nAnyhoo, hope you've enjoyed to this point! I'm excited to write more :)",

      "content": "Leonel stood frozen, his silver rod gripped tightly in one hand and the bracelet he had traded for Aina in his other. He hardly heard the shrieks of the girls cowering behind James as he watch her use Conrad's own shirt to wipe his blood from her arm.\nAina's gaze didn't ever seem to leave his own. Maybe it was Leonel's own illusion, he wasn't sure. But what was certain was that Aina made her way over to him. In a series of events that were nothing more than a blur to him, his bag, the one she had been carrying all this time, the very one he had allowed her to use as a pillow, ended up in his hand. The very same hand he held the bracelet in.\nThe massive battle axe on her seemingly delicate back cast a shadow over his face, dwarfing him completely. Leonel wasn't even consciously aware of what happened next, he only caught small tidbits.\nSavahn was too scared to approach Aina anymore. Yuri's demeanor changed with Aina's appearance as though she had never been afraid. The odd world they were in began to tremble. And before Leonel knew it, he was standing on the grass gardens that once surrounded the Northern Dormitories.\nAll he could think about was Aina's gaze. Her amber, almost golden eyes, peering through his soul. It wasn't particularly cold, nor did it fill him with fear, but there was something deeply unsettling about them, a feeling that set an itch he couldn't reach in his heart.\n\"Leo! LEO!\"\nLeonel's eyes flashed as his body shifted to the side. He stuck his silver rod into the soft soil beneath him and used his now free hand to grab to the side.\nHis reactions were inconceivably quick. He hadn't even seen who attacked him from behind even to this moment. All he had was a frail wrist that almost seemed like it could snap with a single squeeze.\n'Strength 0.72?'\nLeonel was stunned. Knowing he wouldn't be able to hold on for so with his 0.67 level strength, he used the attacker's momentum against them, pulling on their wrist and sweeping his leg across.\n'That's… That's the girl who threw up that day…'\nLeonel's white pupil'd underclassman flipped in the air, falling on her back with a resounding thud.\nJames, who had been the one calling out to Leonel, blinked in shock before smiling bitterly. It seemed his best friend had had his own massive improvements. In fact, with how alert Leonel had been even in a daze just now, he had a feeling that Leonel had suffered more than them all.\nYet, he had somehow managed to keep a bright smile on his face when he came back, only for him to lose that smile due to that event that shocked even James himself. He really didn't know how to console Leonel.\n'Leonel is too soft… How could he deal with the girl he's chased for five years now being…'\nJames sighed.\n\"We can't stay here.\" Leonel finally pulled himself out of his slump. He knew that this wasn't the time to be sulking.\nGrabbing his silver rod, he pressed it to his underclassman's chest, using his leverage to stop her from using her obscene strength.\nWith a quick glance around, he understood the situation.\nLuckily, in the months they had been gone, the white pupil'd mutants had dispersed. But with Leonel's senses, he could hear many of them approaching as though they could grasp their location.\nLeonel counted the number of people around him, feeling a sudden pang when he realized that the number was much less than it should have been.\n\"Zavier… He?\"\nJames' jaw clenched. \"I entered the Sub-Dimensional Zone with him, Milan and Joel… Zavier didn't make it…\"\nLeonel's heart beat erratically for a long while before he managed to stop it. There had been over 30 of them in the beginning, but now only 12 remained. In fact, he felt that it could only have been luck that allowed most of them to survive a Zone.\nThe fiendish struggling beneath the butt of his silver rod caught Leonel's attention, causing him to frown. Before he could react, a flying dagger flew between he and James, entering the girl's throat.\nLeonel looked over with a gloomy expression as the girl's life slipped away.\nHis eyes met Yuri's. She stood beside Aina with her arm raised, her expression nonchalant as though nothing had happened. Aina's gaze had been indifferent, but Yuri's almost held a teasing expression. It was the kind of look that made Leonel's frown deepened.\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" Leonel asked.\nYuri seemed surprised by Leonel's tone for a moment. Maybe it was because she felt what she had done was only natural. Or, maybe it was because she didn't think that Leonel had such a fierce gaze in him. It was obvious that she wasn't in Senior Class A along with him, or else she would never have such a naive thought.\nThe only reason Leonel's imposing aura had never come into play to now was because he couldn't pull his will behind killing. But when it came to his instinctual rage, there was nothing holding it back.\nYuri recovered, her expression dialing back to a neutral gaze that almost said 'just wait'.\nA moment later, the girl who lay dead beneath Leonel began to glow, turning into motes of light that fused with Yuri.\nLeonel hadn't scanned the 'stats' of his friends because it was an instinct he reserved for enemies. But he could faintly feel that Yuri had improved in strength by a small fraction. It was too small of a fraction for Leonel to pinpoint, but he could vaguely feel it.\nThe reason he kept his 'stats' to just two significant figures was because his senses weren't yet sharp enough to break it down further. If he had to guess, Yuri's improvement was somewhere between 0.0001 and 0.00001.\n\"Miss Aina believes that it's best we work together in such a dangerous environment, so instead of being offended by your question, I will explain it to you. These white pupil'd people are called Invalids. They're the people who during their awakening were instead 'eaten' by their abilities, failing to fuse with them.\n\"As a result, they've lost their consciousness, being a humanoid mass of instincts. If they swallow those of us who succeeded, they have a chance to evolve and regain their consciousness. The reason they allowed us to enter the Sub-Dimensional Zone first is because it's in their best interest that we are stronger — they were fattening us like pigs, so to speak.\n\"However, they are essentially a bundle of energy now. So, by killing them we can also grow stronger.\n\"That Invalid was a C-grade Invalid. It is impressive that you were able to handle her so easily. You are worth forming a working relationship with. Do you have anymore questions?\"\nLeonel's gaze turned dull. One couldn't see it, but the veins of his right hand bulged like raging serpents as he clutched the bracelet in his palm. There was something exceptionally dangerous about his darkened look.\n'Miss Aina… is it?' Leonel closed his eyes.\n[Congratulations!]\nThe abrupt beeping that filled all of their minds completely interrupted the tense atmosphere.\n[You all have managed to succeed in crossing this first trial. Though many have fallen, you can be considered the true pillars of our Ascension Empire]\n[However, be warned. All is not safe. These white pupil'd individuals may have once been your friends and family, but right now, their only instinct is to swallow you. They are known as Invalids. Though they appear in the same form they once had when they were alive, they are little more than energy with substance now]\n[Invalids follow the same grading system as your Sub-Dimensional Zones, from the F-grade to the SSS-grade. Be mindful and stay safe]\n[Right now, the next goal of our Empire is to gather you heroes together. Your wrist watches will point you toward the closest center of power in your region. Please head there as quickly and safely as possible so that you can be properly registered. Those who fail to do so will be considered an enemy of the Ascension Empire]\nThe voice was no longer mechanical. In fact, it was distinctly human. Leonel had heard this very voice before. Many times before, actually. It was the Emperor of the Ascension Empire, Emperor Gervaise Fawkes.\n'They want us to register…? Why would they need that, can't they already monitor us…? Unless…'\nLeonel's eyes flashed open, a sudden realization overcoming him. It seemed the forceful tweaks the Empire made to their technology weren't exactly perfect quite yet. Maybe they still weren't aware that Leonel was the first to enter and clear a Zone either.\nAs expected, what their oh-so noble Emperor left them wasn't a true map but rather simply pointed toward a direction, much like the Tier 4 Black detector Leonel had for Sub-Dimensional Zones. The Ascension Empire had always been touchy about distributing maps.\nOnce the announcement was finished, Leonel looked back over toward Yuri and Aina. However this time, he didn't spare Yuri a glance.\n\"If you'd like to work with me, then the orders we follow are mine. Are we clear on this?\"\nYuri frowned and seemed to want to respond, but Aina's delicate hand blocked her.\n\"Yes. That isn't a problem. You seem to have strong sensory abilities, it's only right that you lead.\"\nLeonel so very rarely heard Aina speak, but her voice was just as angelic as he remembered. He still couldn't wrap his mind around her actions. How could he like a girl who treated lives so casually?\nHe knew well what Conrad had done. Maybe to some he deserved death. But Leonel just had a hard time crossing that line. Maybe he was a hypocrite for it, but it was just how he felt.\nHearing these words, Leonel stuffed the bracelet into the ragged pockets of his sweats. He turned his body away, not replying.\n\"You alright, Leo?\" James whispered to his side.\n\"I'm fine.\" Leonel said with a bitter smile. \"Don't worry about me… I think I've already been through worse.\"\nJames patted his shoulder and didn't say much more.\n\"Alright.\" Leonel raised his voice once more. \"The… Invalids aren't far from us already. But I think it's important that I get a read on your abilities before we move out. Mine seem to be categorized as heightened senses, so I'll do my best to lead you out while avoiding as many battles as possible.\"\nJames who had almost always been able to read Leonel even without a cue spoke next.\n\"My and Milan's abilities are very similar, it's how we survived in the Zone. Milan can form a strong shield that can block up to ten C-grade attacks and one B-grade attack before failing. He needs three seconds to form it. And he can form three total before he needs to rest. He also has improved strength beyond normal levels.\n\"I also gained this strength boost and a similar shield. But, I have two separate shields. One can absorb attacks. The other can repel attacks. My shield has an effective range of five meters and form a dome. Milan's form a semi-sphere and has a range of three meters.\n\"I can vary the strength of my shield as well. A one second shield can block two C-grade attacks. A ten second shield can absorb or repel ten B-grade attacks or one A-grade attack.\n\"The last point is just that my absorb shield replenishes my stamina. The reflective shield is self-explanatory.\"\nLeonel's brows cocked, pleasantly surprised. Milan's ability was probably graded as a C, but James' was at least an A. From what he could tell as well, Milan's strength was a 0.59, but James' was a 0.75. The difference was stark.\nMilan laughed jovially, albeit self-deprecatingly.\n\"Seems I'm a little lacking in comparison.\"\nJames grinned, wrapping his arm around Milan's neck and giving the big guy a noogie.\n\"You're not alone.\" Joel laughed lifting up a pole arm that was just over two meters long. \"My ability is related to sharpness, I think. I can add a decent bit of piercing power to the weapons I use, which is why I chose this F-grade pike as a reward.\"\nJoel was a Three-Star Linebacker for their Royal Blues. He had dark skin and kind brown eyes. But when he was on the field, many maligned him as a head hunter for his vicious hits.\nLeonel could tell that Joel's coordination 'stat' was 0.65. Definitely far above average.\nWith that, Leonel went through everyone one by one, calmly memorizing their abilities.\nFinally, he got to Yuri and Aina.\n\"My ability is related to marksmanship with a small bit of telekineses.\" Yuri explained calmly. \"I can improve the accuracy and strength of my throwing knives with my mind. And… I can also retrieve them.\"\nThe dagger she had thrown earlier, still stabbed into the grass, trembled before flying back into her hand obediently.\n\"Miss Aina's ability is an overall exponential boost to her physical abilities whether that be speed, agility, reactions, and especially strength.\"\nThese were words Leonel most definitely didn't doubt…\n[Aina Brazinger]\n[Speed: 0.85; Agility: 0.80; Coordination: 0.95; Stamina: 0.95; Reactions: 0.97]\n…\n[Strength: 0.99]",

      "content": "\"Milan.\"\nHearing Leonel's voice, Milan reacted quickly. He took his tall F-grade tower shield and slammed it forward, ramming the C-grade Invalid backward.\nJoel followed up, his F-grade pike piercing over Milan's shoulder as though the two were one. Just like that, another C-grade Invalid fell.\nIt had already been three days since they began following Leonel, but even Yuri who had been the only one who wanted to reject his leadership had her lips tightly sealed. Not to mention the fact a third of this group was made up of men who shared their lives with him on the football field for four years already, even if this wasn't the case, the results spoke for themselves.\nThey had fought tens of battles in just these three days, but not a single person had been injured. On top of this, they never met a group of Invalids they couldn't handle. The most dangerous situation they had come across was a group of ten D-grade Invalids, but even that seemed to roll off their shoulders like it was nothing.\nOver time, the group gained more confidence and relaxed, their tense nerves loosening. Yet, they somehow didn't become complacent either. No, it wasn't a mistake. Joel, Milan and James always followed Leonel's orders to the finest detail. It was they who set the example for the rest of them.\nMaybe it was only Yuri and the silent Aina who knew things shouldn't have been this easy. It wasn't a coincidence most of them only had F-grade treasures. The Zones they had entered were only of that level, so they hadn't earned any rewards that were better.\nDespite only entering F-grade Sub-Dimensional Zones, just look at how many of them had died. Over half of them would never see their families again. But, somehow they were navigating seas of F to C-grade Invalids as though they were nothing? Since when had the Metamorphosis become such a joke?\nFor moment, Yuri had even believed that Leonel would thrust her into the front-line as revenge. But he actually hadn't done that either.\nLooking toward Leonel, Yuri frowned. Leonel hadn't attacked a single time in these several days. But she was certain that the treasures on him were above the F-grade. And, she had learned through deductions of her own that he had actually woken up before Aina even though her Lady had never said a word about it.\nJust what was going on?\nYuri had known Leonel for a long time. She knew he was intelligent. She was also quite fond of his personality. He was kind and respectful, the kind of man she wouldn't mind being with her Miss. The problem was that he was too weak.\nBut was he really weak? She didn't know anymore.\nHer gaze landed on Leonel's crossed arms. She could see his fingers digging firmly into his own tricep every time another Invalid fell.\nLeonel looked up into the sky. Seeing the sun setting, he made a decision.\n\"Let's stop for today.\"\nThe group was currently in the middle of what they had no choice but to call city ruins. This was the very advanced city that had once surrounded their third ranked Academy. But now, it was practically rubble.\nAfter the Paradise Islands fell from the skies, many of them lay the tall skyscrapers to waste. Even those buildings that weren't directly impacted collapsed after the fierce earthquakes.\nIn order to find shelter for the night, the group had to dig through what was left of the buildings to see if they could find any basements that survived the collapse. Before, they were apprehensive. What would happen if they became trapped or worse, crushed to death?\nBut, Leonel seemed to be able to tell which were safe and which weren't. Though Leonel never fully explained exactly what his abilities were, everyone gained an almost infallible belief in them in just three days.\n\"Aina, if you don't mind.\" Leonel called out.\nWithout a word, Aina walked to the slab of metal and stone Leonel pointed out and lifted it. It would never stop being weird seeing such a small girl lift such a massive load, but it was at the very least easier now than it had been in the past.\nStill, what felt the most uncomfortable for the group was the odd turn in the relationship between Aina and Leonel. They felt that in the past, Leonel would never ask Aina to do such menial work, nor would he speak to her so neutrally. He gave her commands and assignments no differently than he did to anyone else.\nThe group collectively sighed and thanked Aina as they passed by. In the end, Aina slowly lowered the slab, sealing them off from the outside.\nThe underground space they found this time had a decent ten by ten meter size. It gave them all more than enough space to themselves.\nAs usual, Yuri brought out an F-grade tent that took up a bit more than half of the space, inviting the women of the group in. It was quite a convenient thing. Leonel had almost chosen a Tier 4 Black treasure of similar abilities — well, it would be known as a C-grade treasure by those of Earth — but he chose the bracelet still in his pocket instead.\nAlso as per usual, Savahn hesitated, her steps pausing outside the tent. She glanced back toward Leonel with a complicated gaze before she eventually entered as well.\n'How ironic…' Leonel smiled bitterly to himself.\nIn the past, it was Savahn who always 'protected' Aina. Despite Leonel's overall 'good guy' persona, she was even protective against him, shielding Aina from all the bad in the world. As a result, she had always been the most abrasive with him in comparison to Yuri.\nBut now, their roles had inexplicably flipped. And… She was maybe the person who most understood how Leonel was feeling right now.\nLeonel sat down cross legged, the metal container on his back clinking slightly against the stone. He closed his eyes, emptying his mind completely.\nSeeing his present state, James and the rest of the boys decided not to bother him, rolling out the sleeping bags Yuri had given them. They had no need for a scout to stay awake, they knew that Leonel alone would be enough.\nYuri had given Leonel a sleeping bag as well, but he had never used it. She usually snorted when she saw him sitting on the cold stone floors every night, believing that his pride was overblown. But she had no idea the truth was that Leonel had simply gotten used to sleeping this way after months in the Mayan temple. Of course, he couldn't be bothered to explain this to her.\nLeonel sank into his own world. It was a weird state of mind being empty, yet completely alert at the same time. Everything within a fifty meter radius of his body was entirely in his grasp.\n'Just what is this ability of mine… I don't quite understand it even now…'\nLeonel felt that he learned new facets of his ability everyday. After he started practicing [Dimensional Cleanse], new doors opened up constantly.\nThere was only one problem with circulating [Dimensional Cleanse], though. Whenever he did, Invalids would sense their position far easier. During the first night, Leonel was forced to stop and sneak out silently in order to clear them away, something that left him completely sick to his stomach.\nFrom that day on, he only circulated [Dimensional Cleanse] at less than 1% of his ability. This slowed his progress, but it also allowed him to cultivate peacefully without interruption.\nWith that, Leonel locked down a new stat: Spirit.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.72; Speed: 0.67 (+0.1); Agility: 0.75 (+0.1); Coordination: 0.99; Stamina: 0.78 (+0.05); Reactions: 0.99; Spirit: 0.10]\nSpirit was what Leonel classified as the ability to use that weird energy. Unlike his other stats that were measured by the limit of the human body, Leonel set 1.00 as the energy density of a Tier 9 Black threat.\nAfter he categorized it this way, he immediately slotted himself in for 0.10. However, in three days, it hadn't budged a single inch. Or, more accurately, it had, but Leonel couldn't register it sharply enough to put a number to it.\nStill, there were other outstanding effects. Leonel's Reactions and Coordination had improved to 0.99. It was only now he felt that the barrier to 1.00 was exceptionally thick.\nLuckily, though his coordination and reactions had slowed to a grinding halt, his other 'stats' had also increased decently. Setting aside the boosts from his treasures, his speed had improved to 0.57 and his agility to 0.65. Of course there was also the leap of 0.05 in his strength and the increase in his stamina to 0.73.\nFrom what Leonel could tell, these changes most definitely didn't come from [Dimensional Cleanse]. He had picked that technique primarily because it increased his spirit. His spirit, by extension, increased his coordination and reactions. In addition, his coordination had a positive impact on his agility. But, spirit should have had next to no impact on his strength or speed.\nSimply put, Leonel had no idea where these 'stat' increases were coming from. But his body seemed to be slowly improving over time at a pace that was out of his control. And, whatever improvement it seemed to not appear in the Zones.\n'It might be related to what Uncle Montez was saying about Pseudo Fourth Dimensional constitutions? Maybe as a world evolves, its people do too. The closer Earth comes to the Fourth Dimension, the closer we all come to dropping that 'Pseudo' from our title.\n'But if that's the case… Why isn't anyone else experiencing this increase —.'\nLeonel's eyes flashed open. 'Something big is coming…'\nWithout a sound Leonel jumped up. Everyone around him seemed to be soundly asleep already. Looking at the time, he should have been practicing [Dimensional Cleanse] for several hours.\nMaking his way to a smaller second exit, Leonel exerted some strength and quietly left, appearing beneath the night sky and high raised moonlight.\n'B-grade…' Leonel sighed.\nThe group he had taken out two nights ago were just a bunch of F-grade Invalids. Their boost to his 'stats' were so minuscule that Leonel knew they couldn't have had an impact on his 'stat' increases.\nThough this quickly approaching Invalid was of the B-grade, Leonel wasn't afraid despite the fact he knew the Priest he had struggled with so much was still a sliver away from the B-grade himself.\nThere was something Leonel had realized over these few days. First, Invalids weren't as intelligent as humans, making them less dangerous than the 'Bosses' of Zones. Second, not all Invalids had the same abilities. They personified the abilities they would have had had they survived the awakening process.\nSimply put, the Priest was a C-grade Spirit type entity. This made him especially dangerous to a naive youth like Leonel who knew little of this world of powers and abilities. The Priest's Spirit had actually been much higher than Leonel's current 'stat'.\nThis was all to say that a B-grade speed type Invalid like the one rushing toward Leonel now was much easier to deal with.\n'Why'd you have to come here.'\nLeonel stood atop the rubble, his left hand calmly reaching toward his back and his right pulling his white boned atlatl from his waist.\n'40 meters… 30… you've long since gotten too close.'\nA beautiful silver dart with feathers of white to one end appeared in Leonel's hand. It was just about a meter and a half in length, looking more like a work of art as it sat atop Leonel's atlatl instead of the deadly weapon it was.\nCocking his arm back and releasing with barely 20% of his ability, Leonel allowed a line of silver to cut across the skies, reflecting the dull moonlight.\nThe Invalid who dashed forward like a vampire in the night was suddenly struck in the forehead, a hole as thin as a bullet wound bloodying its skull.\nWith a heavy heart, Leonel crossed the 20 meter distance between them. His use of [Call of the Wind] was already too refined for an enemy to survive at such a close distance.\nBending down the side of the Invalid who was beginning to turn to motes of light, he caught a glimpse of its face. On the last day he rode his bike to school, the day of the Championship Game, this 'Invalid' had been among those to greet him and wish him luck. He even said he bet on Leonel to succeed with Aina that time around.\nBy this point, it felt like a lifetime ago.\nLeonel picked up his dart. It was slightly damaged, but if his treasure could build darts from raw materials, why wouldn't it have the ability to repair ones with nicks and scratches? To now, Leonel still had all 200 it came with.\n'I guess that's it for tonight. I'll head back and rest.'\nLeonel suddenly looked over his shoulder, frowning. He thought he had sensed something, but there was nothing.\nJust as Leonel was about to investigate further, his mind trembled.\nAn inconspicuous black wrist band on his arm that seamlessly blended into his flexible armor silently tugged him in a certain direction.\nA Zone had appeared! But not just that… It was within 500 meters of this place.\nBut, what truly shook Leonel was the fact he sensed not just one but seven A-grade Invalids!\nIt was only then Leonel realized the appearance of his B-grade underclassman wasn't a coincidence. Could it be that Zone openings attracted Invalids too?",

      "content": "Leonel closed his eyes, a deep unwillingness sinking into his heart.\nThat day, when the virgin sacrifice almost strangled him to death, he really had resigned himself. He had even said goodbye to his father. Yet, he woke up.\nHow was he supposed to feel about that exactly? Was he supposed to think he was forgiven for the 1000 deaths that lay squarely on his shoulders?\nUncle Montez had said it clearly. Sub-Dimensional Zones were points in Earth's history where an event that connected to the Fourth Dimension occurred. In other words… They were real.\nEvery throat he pierced, every head he severed, every life that slipped away. They were all real.\nLeonel had a hard time dealing with that. The reason he had smiled so brightly when he finally saw Aina again was because he thought that she was his light, the only pure thing remaining in his life. But she shattered that image barely a moment later.\nIn truth, Leonel didn't even know what he was fighting for anymore. He guessed it was just some primal instinct to survive, but he couldn't think of much else. Clearly his parents weren't that much of a motivating factor considering how easily he had given up in the temple.\n'What the hell is wrong with me?'\nLeonel might have just turned 18, but he was just a kid in the end. He knew that he didn't want to be a quarterback for the rest of his life, but he never really thought about what exactly he wanted to do outside of that.\nLeonel chuckled to himself as seven A-grade Invalids converged. By now, it wasn't just them anymore, but numerous lower level Invalids who crept forward as well.\n'The most important part of my identity all that time was just liking her, huh… I don't know whether I should be sad or laugh some more.'\nThe truth was that Leonel was trying his best to find a reason to fight back, to put his life on the line once again and bloody his hands once more.\nFor his parents? He had already tried that once before. For Aina? He didn't even know if he still felt the same way about her. For his friends…?\nLeonel thought of James. His best friend for as long as he could remember. To this day, he still didn't know why James tried to throw the Championship Game. He didn't know why he hadn't just let him do it either. They had already won three times, and winning a fourth would have been meaningless.\n\"I know you too well. You don't like to lose, but you're too soft-hearted to call me out on my bullshit too. So, you'd find a way to protect our friendship and ignore it, all while winning the big game anyway. Am I right?\"\nJames' words to him reverberated in Leonel's mind. He suddenly felt his hands moving of their own accord, sliding three silver bars out and screwing them together.\n'I guess it'll just have to be that simple then…'\nHe didn't like to lose.\nIt was an immature thought. One you would expect from an 18 year old boy. If Leonel thought any more deeply about it, he too would find it ridiculous that he was trading what he thought was his moral code for a will to win. But the reality was that Leonel was looking for something, for anything, to give him a reason to keep going. The reason never mattered at all…\nLeonel clicked the hidden button on his silver rod. The moment his bike fully formed, he jumped onto it, riding up the side of a massive slab of broken wall and jumping five meters into the air.\nIn that instant of time he spent in the air, his gaze captured everything.\n'Two are within 100 meters. Four are between 100 and 300. The last one is further than 400 meters away.'\nIt wasn't that Leonel's gaze landed on them all. Rather, it was that he found it easier to feel out the fluctuating energies without so many buildings in the way.\nLeonel had run across A-grade Invalids before, in the last three days, that is. He knew how sensitive they were to humans. It took a lot of effort to shake just one off. If these seven caught sight of their base, Leonel would no longer be able to guarantee everyone's safety. Even James' ten-second shield could only block a single A-grade attack.\nThe higher the grade, the exponentially more difficult the Invalid was to handle. Their 'stats' not only became more well rounded, but their intelligence wasn't so easy to fool anymore either.\nLeonel's knees bent as he landed on the ground, expertly using his high coordination to balance on the rubble before shooting forward once more. He controlled his bike with a single handle and used the other to grab a dart, shifting it around in his fingers until he could both grab his atlatl and fit it to it at the same time.\nIn a flash, Leonel rounded the corner of a building that seemed just an inch away from falling completely over. Half of its top was completely shaved off, having fallen to the other side of the street.\nHe made eye-contact with those cold, emotionless white pupils. They locked onto Leonel with a concealed murderous intent as though it was still slinking in the shadows.\nThe Invalid was long and lanky, having a back so arched that the back of its hands almost dragged along the ground.\nDespite its lazy appearance, it dodged Leonel's first dart with ease despite being just 20 meters away. Its lanky body curled at an impossible angle, its head arching back so far that its skull nearly cracked against the ground.\n'Coordination of 0.87. Its host body should have an ability related to disconnecting and reconnecting bones, making it an expert of close combat. It has good speed, strength and reactions.'\nAs far as Leonel could tell, F-grade beings had stats between 0.50 and 0.60. D-grade entered the up to 0.70 realm. C-grade was usually up to 0.8. B-grade was below 0.85 with A-grade being below 0.90. Leonel wasn't certain about the S, SS and SSS-grades. In addition, the spirit stat seemed to work a lot differently. The Priest had only been a 0.05 on Leonel's scale, but he was most definitely a C-grade threat.\nOf course, these were only averages. Some could cross barriers by having less stats, but being more well-rounded.\nThis A-grade Invalid happened to have more of its 'stats' in Coordination and Reactions. Though its strength and speed were still above 0.60.\n'How unfortunate…'\nWithout hesitation he pedaled into a ten meter radius in a flash, jumping into the air and turning his bike back into a silver rod.\n'… your strengths happen to be my strengths. But… I'm a level better.\"\nLeonel clashed with the A-grade Invalid. His movements were wild and almost without reason. Anyone could see with a glance that he had never been formally trained. And yet, those very same wild movements seemed simple and precise to the point of suffocation.\nAfter a moment, you would realize that it wasn't that Leonel's style of battle was usually this wild… It was that he was actually adapting his fighting style to match that odd style of the lanky Invalid!\nThe Invalid's arm suddenly doubled in length shooting toward Leonel, but a step ahead, Leonel had already tilted his head to the side. He had already seen through this Invalid's ability, why wouldn't he be ready for such a change?\nLeonel took a strong step forward. His silver rod spun in his hand, its butt rounding in a beautiful semi-circular arc and crushing the Invalid's windpipe.\nHe released his rod with a hand, reaching to his back and pulling out a dart he stabbed through the Invalid's eye and skull.\nPulling his dart out, he had already turned his silver rod back into a bicycle and dashed away. By the time he scooped up the dart that initially missed and tossed it back into his steel container, the Invalid had collapsed to the ground — dead.\n'The other is already closing in. There's no way it won't sense them within fifty meters. But before that, it should be meandering on instinct… I need to intercept it.'\nLeonel felt the motes of lights meld with his body, but he didn't have much of a reaction. His face held an expressionless visage to it, there was no joy, nor was there any anger.\nHe cut a tight corner, riding up the side of a collapsed building and hopping across to the roof of another.\nHe spun his bike to the side, dragging its tires along the ground to a searing halt that left a cloud of dust in his wake.\nLeonel hopped off, eyeing his target in the distance.\nHe spread out his stance, his base becoming impeccably sturdy as he tightened his torso. A dart appeared in his hand, sliding perfectly into his atlatl.\nThrowing a spear while on his bike was one matter. He couldn't rely on his legs for power, only his arm. However… When his feet were planted firmly on the ground… He was a completely different animal.\nSHHHHHHHWOOOOO\nLeonel's arm shot forward like a canon, his dark whistling through the air with a sharp sound. [Call of the Wind] could only be considered to have been mastered to the entry level by Leonel. Yet, he was already capable of throwing his darts at 250 kilometers per hour.\nThe target Invalid was almost like a miniature giant. In fact, it dragged its feet around completely in the nude. Obviously, whatever clothes its host had been wearing had been ripped to shreds. What remained was a bestial man that stood at over two meters tall. But what was exceptionally striking was its wide body. It was almost shaped like a box.\nLeonel had already seen that its strength stat was at 0.95. It was one of the variant cases of a stat surpassing its grade. However, the reason it could only be of the A-grade is because… Its other stats were too low!\n[Hulking Invalid]\n[Strength: 0.95; Speed: 0.47; Agility: 0.15; Coordination: 0.56; Stamina: 0.89; Reactions: 0.51; Spirit: 0.00]\nAside its strength and stamina, its other stats could barely be considered of the F-grade, some not even that.\nSo, when Leonel attacked from just 30 meters away with a dart that looked no different from a shooting star across the night sky, the massive Invalid couldn't even blink before its eye was pierced and half its brain turned to mush.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.73; Speed: 0.67 (+0.1); Agility: 0.75 (+0.1); Coordination: 0.99; Stamina: 0.78 (+0.05); Reactions: 0.99; Spirit: 0.10]\nLeonel's strength stat ticked up by 0.01. This was the first substantial change he had ever run across after absorbing an Invalid's energy. There probably existed a technique that improved the efficiency… But he didn't think too much about it.\nIn truth, Leonel more so wished for increases to his stamina. He had only killed two A-grade Invalids, but he already felt it was eating into his reserve strength.\n'… Five left…'\nLeonel gritted his teeth, pedaling hard.",

      "content": "[Bonus Chapter for reaching 50 powerstones. Next at 100. 7 more reviews till next bonus chapter]\nLeonel breathed hard. The fog of his breath under the chilly night sky reflected like crystals within the moonlight.\nBelow him, yet another A-grade Invalid had fallen, and though Leonel remained uninjured, he could feel himself reaching his limits.\nIt wasn't the first time Leonel had felt like that. During those months in the Mayan temple, he experienced it all the time. It was just that he had underestimated the pressure A-grade Invalids could put on him.\nThough his life was constantly on the line in the temple, it had to be remembered that the Spaniards were barely considered D-grade threats, and that was only when their weapons were factored in. Alone, they were normal mortals, not even of the F-grade. Their only real threat to Leonel were their numbers, especially after his battle experience deepened.\n'Still not good enough. I'm wasting too much energy… One more left…'\nLeonel pedaled hard to the next spot. This Invalid had originally been over 400 meters away, but by now, it was within 50 of their base. There was no doubt that it had already caught their scent.\nBy the time Leonel made it there, panting, he came face to face with an Invalid that seemed painted in silver. Its skin had become a flexible metal and judging by the heavy sounds its normal footsteps caused, maybe it wasn't just its skin that followed this pattern.\nAcross the board, its stats were completely normal. Nothing was above 0.70. But Leonel knew his senses would not lie to him. This was most definitely an A-grade threat.\nNow more than ever Leonel realized just how flawed his self-created stat system was. He still didn't have the ability to account for everything. He couldn't even begin to posit how he would perfectly account for all of these abilities properly.\nFrom just about 20 meters away, Leonel launched a dart, immediately catching the attention of the metal Invalid. Just as he hoped, it diverted its attention away from his sleeping friends. However, aside from that, the results were less than pleasing.\nThe dart's tip completely shattered against the Invalids body. Its reactions were far too slow to dodge, and its agility was even worse, but it didn't seem to matter. There wasn't even a single scratch on its body.\n'… Dammit…'\nLeonel quickly loaded another dart, this time aiming for its eye as he continued to pedal. But the dart was shattered once more with a simple blink.\n'Did it blink just on reflex? Or are its eyes truly vulnerable?'\nThere wasn't much time left to think. Leonel hopped off his bike once more, charging with his shoulder and ramming into the Invalid's chest.\nA grunt escaped Leonel's lips as the Invalid was sent tumbling backward.\n'Only 5'10, lean body type, yet weighs over 400 pounds…'\nRealizing the ramifications of this Leonel retreated a few steps, nursing the numbness of his shoulder. He had thought that the defensive abilities of his flexible armor would protect him enough to do some damage, but it was very clear that this metal ability of this Invalid was several levels more durable.\n'I was wrong. I was using the specifications of a normal human to measure out his stats, but that's foolish. In order for a normal human to exert the kind of force it can while being at less than half the body weight…'\n[Metal Invalid]\n[Strength: 1.02; Speed: 1.05; Agility: 1.00; Coordination: 0.50; Stamina: 1.05; Reactions: 0.50; Spirit: 0.00]\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath. The adjusted stats were mind numbing. These were the stats a normal human of about 5'10 160 pounds would need to move around with the ability of this Invalid.\nIf this Invalid had more time to adjust to its ability and reached an equilibrium point where it was no longer impeded by its heavy body… Just what kind of monster would it be? S-grade? SSS-grade? Something beyond even that? He had simply never seen a stat above 0.99.\nHow many other Invalids were there with this level of potential danger attached to them?\nThe Invalid slowly picked itself off of the ground, its white pupils locking onto Leonel with a dull gaze.\nBefore Leonel registered what was happening a long sharp blade suddenly appeared between his brows.\nLeonel's eyes widened. He pulled his head back as fast as he could, withstanding the whiplash with gritted teeth.\nA fine cut slit across his forehead, the breath of death kissing his cheek. If it wasn't for his obscene reaction time, his skull would have already been split into two.\nLeonel rolled across the ground, realizing that he had once more miscalculated. Not only was this Invalid covered in metal, but it could shape this metal as it pleased. In that moment, even with Leonel completely focused on it, its arm suddenly became a three meter long blade, nearly impaling him.\n'So fast… At least 0.90. I have to adjust his base agility because of that. Dammit!'\nIn Leonel's calculations, attack speed was factored into agility. If he corrected the Invalid's stats like this, then its adjusted agility for a normal human would be even more ridiculous.\nLeonel grunted, using his silver rod to block a second blade. But though the metals his rod was formed of managed to withstand the sharp edge, the weight was too much for him to stay on his feet.\nLeonel coughed violently as his back slammed into a half collapsed building.\nHe didn't have the luxury of slowly recovering. Without pause, yet another blade tore through the air toward him.\nThere was no time for Leonel to land back on the ground before it reached him. Thinking quickly, he hooked his rod into a broken window. He turned it hard, launching himself toward his left.\nThe blade tore through the building's wall as though it was a piece of paper. It continued to follow through, chasing after Leonel while slicing through tough sheets of metal and stone with absolute ease.\nLeonel fell through the air quickly, morphing his silver rod back into a bike and pedalling away.\n'His blade gets thinner the further from his body it is. He isn't producing more metal, he's just diluting what he has to extend his range. So…'\nLeonel's gaze flashed, his thoughts spinning.\nHis bike sped up.\n'There it is! Ten meters is his limit!'\nLeonel bike cut a hard turn, driving up the side of a tilted building and back toward the the Invalid with everything his thighs could muster and flipped back.\nLeonel soared through the air. There was no longer any room to maneuver. He fell in an arc aimed right for the Invalid.\nThe Invalid's gaze showed no emotion. It simply brandished its second arm, sending out a blade that was impossible for Leonel to dodge.\nLeonel twisted his body, a sharp spike of pain ripping through his left shoulder as the blade went through him and his flexible armor with ease. However, his gaze remained pure and focused.\nHis bike turned back into a rod he gripped tightly. Using it like a spear, with his only good remaining arm, he stabbed it toward the Invalid's eye.\nThe pain was absolutely excruciating. As his body fell under gravity's influence, the blade tore further and further into his shoulder. There were several times in those split seconds that Leonel thought he would pass out.\nA sharp clink sounded as the Invalid closed its eyes. However, Leonel had already expected this. He wouldn't lay his life on the line for such a poor attempt at victory.\nBoth of his feet landed on the free shoulder of the Invalid, the very one he had stretched the arm of to a ten meter length. In his hurry to attack Leonel who was streaking through the air, he had yet to retract it, just as expected. The Invalid's coordination was too low to complete too many fine motor tasks at once.\nLeonel roared, both of his legs slamming downward with all of his might.\nThe Invalid fell over. Then with a sharp SNAP, its arm broke right at its shoulder joint.\nLeonel finally hit the ground, his own shoulder becoming a bloody mess as he rolled away, just managing to pull the Invalid's blade out.\nSlowly pushing himself up, Leonel's eyes remained focused. He had used advantage of the Invalid stretching itself too thin to break off one of its arms. But in the process, he did functionally lost an arm as well.\nThe break in Leonel's flexible armor began to mend itself, sowing his wound shut at the same time. This was why he dared to take on such a terrible injury. Even if his left arm was now all but useless, blood loss wouldn't be a problem. In fact, due to the amount of pressure his armor was placing on his wound to keep it suppressed, in a pinch, it wouldn't be impossible to withstand some pain and use it.\n'He's bleeding.' Leonel's pupils constricted.\nHe could see it. From the split in the Invalid's shoulder, a coarse, metal infused liquid was dripping. Leonel could even faintly see some pink muscle fibers.\n'So his inner organs aren't metal! If that's the case there are some other methods I can use. His coordination stat is too poor to extend blades from anywhere other than his arms. Now that I only have to worry about just one…'\nLeonel sprinted forward. As he did, he dropped one of his silver rod's three sections away, leaving it at a manageable length for his one arm. It took some teeth grinding to use his left arm to pin it in place while he did this, but he managed to push through.\nThe Invalid struggled to stand, but despite losing an arm, it was still too heavy. In addition, with its poor coordination and relative strength, maneuvering with just a single arm was too difficult. To make matters worse, its only remaining arm was still in the form of the blade that pierced Leonel's shoulder.\nIt had only barely managed to get to its knees when Leonel appeared before it, swinging down with all his might right onto its skull.\nThe loud clang of metal bashing against metal sounded under the otherwise quiet night sky.\nLeonel's actions seemed foolish. It was impossible for his blunt weapon to kill the Invalid in this way, and with its metal skin, he couldn't injure it either. However, something shocking happened in the next moment.\nThe Invalid stumbled. From its position on its knees, it wobbled as though dizzy. By the time it reoriented itself, another strike had come downward, bashing its head again.\nThis time, unable to brace itself, its head rebounded against the concrete.\nIt was exactly as Leonel expected. If this Invalid could bleed, if it had normal muscle fibers, its internal organs were likely normal. In such a case, what would happen to a soft brain rattling inside a metal box that was being hit so hard?\nNot only did the Invalid's metal body start ringing, but so did the rod in Leonel's hand. Leonel smartly didn't focus on striking down with as much force as possible anymore. Instead, he focused on finding the resonance frequency of the metal, making it store more and more energy.\nLeonel's senses locked onto the perfect striking strength. With his unmatched coordination, he swung his arm in perfect rhythm, neither using too much or too little power.\nBy Leonel's tenth strike, his breathing was like hot coal to his body. The Invalid lay twitching on the ground, but Leonel madly continued. It was too strong. If he let up and let it recover, it would be him who died here.\nUnwittingly, in his fatigue, his mind settled into a primal near bestial state, his hidden imposing aura blooming forth and blanketing the area more and more with every swing.\nLeonel didn't even notice that blood began to ooze along with an unknown white substance from the Invalid's ears. The only so-called 'twitching' was of its fingers just barely scraping against the ground, the last movements of the dead.\nIt wasn't until Leonel's rod slipped through the motes of lights it became and hit the concrete, almost shattering his wrist, did he awake from his stupor.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.75; Speed: 0.70 (+0.1); Agility: 0.80 (+0.1); Coordination: 0.99; Stamina: 0.81 (+0.05); Reactions: 0.99; Spirit: 0.10]\nThe improvement was shocking. Maybe even more shocking was the fact that over 90% of it had come from this lone A-grade Invalid. The other six had hardly caused a shift.\nLeonel realized that his rating system was too flawed. If he couldn't accurately predict things in this way, it had little value. But in truth, this wasn't what was on Leonel's mind at this moment.\nHe had killed again. But this kill… It was very different from the others. He had done it subconsciously, as though there was a beast lying in his mind… as though his 'morality' was just fake posturing he used to absolve himself of responsibility.\n\"Look at that, he really killed it. Damn, I knew I should have bet.\"\n\"Too late. Who asked you to reject free money?\"\n\"You dodged a bullet and now you want to gloat? Weren't you the one just saying the kid was definitely dead?\"\n\"Shut up the two of you.\"\nLeonel frowned. He hadn't picked up these people before. They had definitely been waiting outside the 50 meter radius of him.\nIn meditation, Leonel's senses were near perfect within 50 meters. In a state of wakefulness like he was now, 20 meters was his best. But, he still had vague inklings of the goings on up to 50 meters away. In addition, he could gain a very rough picture of a few hundred meters if the targets had large enough energy signatures, like the A-grade Invalids, for example.\nWith how he had sharpened his battle experience in the Mayan temple, he would never lower his guard so easily. He had been constantly scanning the area in case other Invalids came to interrupt his fight. But he had never thought the ones to come would be other humans.\n\"Hey, kid. We can make this easy on you. After all, we're fellow humans. You seem to have gotten some good stuff out of your Zone. That rod looks particularly useful. How about you share some with us and we'll let you go unharmed?\"\nLeonel's face remained expressionless. His rod? This was about the only thing on his body that wasn't a reward from the Zone he entered. It seemed not everyone was able to see through treasure grades as easily as he could.\nBut that inadvertently gave Leonel another thought. These treasures in his hand were gifted by higher level worlds. Obviously they didn't come from Silver Zones that one could take treasures out of or else they'd be higher grade. Didn't that mean these weapons were created? In that case, could Earth do the same?\n'I'll just shatter their knee caps with my darts and leave them to karma —'\nLeonel went to reach for his dart and froze, a sharp pain flying through his body.\nHe hadn't broken his wrist. But… His right shoulder was dislocated!\nEven as Leonel was thinking of running, a figure came crashing from tens of meters above him, landing to his side with a BOOM.",

      "content": "\"… Aina?\"\nLeonel suddenly remembered that before he sensed that seven A-grade Invalids, he had also caught the faint fluctuation of someone or something else. But he had lost track of it near immediately. Could that have been Aina?\nBut if it was, should he feel bitter about the fact she hadn't raised a hand to help him to now?\nThese thoughts didn't survive very long because though Aina tried to hide it, his senses were much too sharp. He saw that not only was she not in top form currently, but there were small specks of dirt, blood and grime in hard to find areas. There was no way Aina had rolled out of bed like that.\nAina turned back and looked up at Leonel.\n\"Why did you leave without a word? I already said that it's not safe to work alone.\"\nHearing these words, Leonel instinctually frowned.\n\"Are you sure it was you who said that? Or was it your servant Yuri?\"\nLeonel was shocked by the own snappiness in his voice. But the mixture of resentment and fatigue left him unable to control his emotions very well.\nIt really had been Yuri who said that her 'Miss Aina' wanted to work together. Those words had never come out of Aina's own mouth. Why should he care about something she couldn't even be bothered to say personally? He was more surprised she hadn't sent her little servant here instead.\n\"Both.\" Aina replied with a glare. \"You're our leader, you can't recklessly leave on your own. Even if you did it to protect us, don't you think your own safety is important too? If you fall, do you think they would be able to survive for long?!\"\nThese were the most words Leonel had ever heard Aina speak. However, even if he was stunned, he had far more pent up rage that suppressed it completely.\nJust as he wanted to respond, a snicker came from a few meters away.\n\"It's fine if you two want to have a lover's quarrel, but do so after you meet my demands. That ax on your back looks pretty good girl. You can hand it over too.\"\nAina's head snapped back to the three men.\n\"Shut the hell up while I'm talking or you'll find yourselves split in half before you can regret it!\"\nLeonel's gaze trembled at those words. He didn't even have time to register the shock he should have felt about them coming from Aina's mouth. Was this the same shy girl who ran away every time he confessed? The same quiet girl who spoke so few words before?\n\"How can you keep treating human lives so casually?!\"\nAina's head snapped back toward Leonel. \"Can't you tell that they want to kill you?! Do you really believe that they'll just back away after all of this?! They saw you kill an A-grade Invalid on your own, you think they want that kind of enemy getting away from them?! Why are you so naive?!\"\nLeonel's eyes bulged, reddening in a torrent of uncontrollable anger.\n\"Did you see that?\" One of the leading man's partners pointed. \"That's got to be one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. She's probably one of those noble girls from a big family… I really want to taste one.\"\nIt seemed that since Aina immediately faced Leonel when she fell by his side, and the fact her massive ax covered her back view, it wasn't until she turned to curse at them that they got a true look at her.\n\"She really does look good… You got first dibs last time, though. It's my turn.\"\n\"No way! She smells like a virgin, I can catch the whiff from here. She's much higher quality than the last one.\"\nThe leader cut in, licking his lips. \"Let's use the usual method to decide.\"\n\"Fine! Rock-paper-scissors it is.\"\n\"Ready —.\"\nThe night sky fell into a greater darkness. For a moment, it felt that even the moon above was eclipsed, the bloody, murderous intent suffocating even its beauty.\nThe three men turned toward Leonel, terrified expressions on their faces.\n\"I dare you to say another word about her.\"\nLeonel's eyes, already fueled by his other burning emotions, had almost completely turned a blood red. His whites were swarmed by snaking blood vessels, and his irises, once a gentle hazel, blackened completely.\nThey simply didn't deserve to live.\nLeonel's muscles flexed so strongly that his dislocated shoulder snapped back into place. Ignoring the twanging pain, he reached to his back and pulled out three darts.\nWhat happened next could only be considered a blur. Three flying silver spears. Three cries for help. Three bloody holes. Three dead corpses.\nEven after the deed was done, Leonel was still livid.\nAina sent a glance toward him, her emotions once more unreadable. She walked forward and took the treasures they had kept on their bodies and walked back while Leonel was still in a blinded rage.\n\"Oof…!\"\nA tiny fist smashed against Leonel's chest, causing him to stumble backward and fall to the ground in his fatigue. If it wasn't for his flexible armor, his ribs would have probably broken.\nLeonel looked up to find Aina. He obviously knew that she was the one responsible, but he was too tired to do much about it. He simply met her gaze, huffing and puffing.\n\"These are only D-grade, but they're still better than using your bike as a weapon like that.\"\nA pile of treasures fell from her small arms. There were three weapons, a shield, and three armors for various body parts. Of the armors, one was for the shins, another was a helmet, and the last was a chest protector. As for the weapons, there was a pike, a sword and finally a spear.\nLeonel didn't answer, getting the first good look at Aina he had in almost a year. Even when he came back from the Mayan temple, he hadn't had a chance before her arm was suddenly through Conrad's chest.\nLooking at her now, he still couldn't fuse her image with the devil of her that had been growing in his mind. Her features were too delicate, too beautiful, for her to be that same woman who all but ripped a man's heart out with her bare hands.\nHer body was fitted in a deep black militaristic outfit. There were many pockets and belts that surrounded her figure, still doing just as bad a job at hiding her curves as her dresses had. Her long black hair flowed loosely in the wind, disappearing into its folds from time to time.\nSomehow, her amber eyes seemed closer to gold than they had been before. Whether that was his imagination, or the objective reality, Leonel wasn't sure.\nLeonel smiled bitterly, realizing why he had avoided observing her closely over the past few days. His heart… It still beat wildly.\n\"… Leave the rest of the things for the others. I'll take the spear and shield…\n\"Also, thank you. I didn't consider enough that if there were A-grade Invalids around drawn in by the Zone opening, there would definitely be other Invalids as well.\"\nAina's expression softened at these words, but she didn't say anything in response.\n\"Let's head back.\" Leonel slowly picked himself off of the ground.\n\"We can't.\" Aina suddenly said. \"As you said, the Zone is pulling in Invalids. Until it's closed, getting out of this area will be difficult. Invalids have far sharper senses than we do in exchange for their weaker intelligence. They can sense a Zone from tens of miles away and will slowly converge.\"\nLeonel frowned. He most definitely wasn't in a state to be entering a Zone right now.\n\"Here.\" Aina handed him something that looked like a pill. She had pulled it out from one of the many pockets she had.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. He hadn't been able to sense something with such dense energy despite Aina standing right in front of him. It seemed her pockets weren't normal.\nThere wasn't any skepticism in Leonel's thoughts. He took the pill from her, careful not to touch her soft palm, and swallowed it.\nA fire lit down his throat, coursing through his body as through it was a racetrack.\nThe wound on his left shoulder rapidly sealed, and even the soreness in his right vanished. Finally, his fatigue trickled away as though he had just taken a good nap.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.80; Speed: 0.75 (+0.1); Agility: 0.85 (+0.1); Coordination: 0.99; Stamina: 0.86 (+0.05); Reactions: 0.99; Spirit: 0.10]\nA flash of energy raged around Leonel's body. A barrier that had blocked him crumbled and he felt his spirit shoot upward.\n[Spirit: 0.11]\nIt was a small change, but Leonel felt that it made a world of difference.\nJust what kind of pill was that? Almost all his stats had ticked up by 0.05. Leonel wasn't a fool. He knew this pill was more valuable than Aina let on. Even putting his life on the line against the metal Invalid wasn't as good.\n\"Take care of yourself from now on.\" Aina said. \"This pill only works once.\"\n\"Thanks.\" Leonel said absentmindedly.\n\"We can go now. Yuri will find this place after we've gone.\"\n\"Shouldn't we wait for them, then? It's not far, we're already less than 50 meters from them.\"\nAfter he said this, Leonel mumbled under his breath. \"I've already made the mistake of entering a Zone without enough numbers before.\"\nAina's senses were sharper than he gave them credit for. Her brows raised in shock at these words unbeknownst to him.\n\"No. The Zone is an S-grade Zone with a two person limit. I have a detection device that has 95% accuracy on Zones below the SS-grade.\"\n\"Alright then.\" Leonel didn't question it. Aina and him were without a doubt the two most powerful of their group. It only made sense for them to enter.\nIt didn't take long for the two to cross the 500-meter distance to the Zone, having not spoken a single word to the other.\nThe density of Invalids had been growing, but with Leonel's senses, if they wanted to avoid them, it wasn't a problem. The target of the Invalids was never the Zone itself, but rather the humans it would attract. And, with their lack of intelligence, they didn't know to wait directly outside of the whirling blue portal.\nUnlike the portal that dragged them in so many months prior, this portal didn't have a suction effect. It sat hovering in the air silently, not disturbing the area at all.\nIf he wasn't certain before, Leonel was now that there was something fundamentally different about the first Zone they were sent into. Maybe if he entered this time, the subtle up-ticks in his stats would continue instead of pausing like it had last time.\nAfter taking Aina's pill, Leonel realized something. That burning feeling… It was exactly like the green vomit his dad made him drink everyday for 17 years. What if the slow increases in his stats wasn't because of the normal evolution of his body as Earth tended toward the Fourth Dimension, but was rather thanks to his father?\nLeonel and Aina simultaneously leaped from a perch high up, falling into the Zone that swirled shut behind them. In their absence, the Invalids lost track of the scent that had converged them and they began to slowly disperse.\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone detected: Merlin's Prophecy. Joan of Arc. Jeanne d'Arc]\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone grade: A]\n[Clear requirements: Aid Joan of Arc in repelling the English Army]\n[Side Quest: Unable to detect. Scope of system too limited]\n[Reward: Unable to detect. Scope of system too limited]\n[It is recommended that subject, Leonel Morales, complete this quest with a minimum of seven other individuals. Subject's D-grade ability is too low]\n'Eight person limit?…' Leonel shook his head.\nThe voice of Leonel's wrist watch sounded in his mind, but he ignored it in the end. Compared to Aina's detection treasure, it was too inferior. There was no need to take any of it seriously. It couldn't even get the S-grade correct. Last time it had predicted the Mayan temple was an F-grade Zone until he ran into the Priest and it upped it to the C-grade.\nPlus, he didn't really have the luxury to think about it even if he wanted to.\nHe and Aina appeared in a small village filled with dusted roads. But, considering the burning cottages and huts around them, not to mention the sound of screaming and clanking swords, it was under attack.\nThere was only one thing Leonel did trust his wrist watch about. This was likely France and their quest most definitely had something to do with that legendary woman.",

My typing speed will plummet so if I give too many bonus chapters, it will eat into my reserves too quickly x). I'll bring the system back once I'm back up to speed. So for now, I will only upload 1 chapter a day]\n\"Use this belt.\"\nAina, who had all sorts of belts and pockets strapped across her body, somehow managed to pull out another one.\nLeonel accepted. Strapping things to the band of his sweatpants was really too inconvenient. He felt he was using more energy than he cared to admit making sure his things didn't fall out mid-battle.\nHe buckled it around his waist, strapping the three rods of his bike to it along with his atlatl. After that, he strapped the meter or so tall silver box that contained his darts to his opposite waist. If he was still a normal human, it would impede his movements too much to place it there. But the current him found it much more convenient.\nTo his surprise, the box actually shrunk. From only a couple inches from touching the ground, it shrunk to stop just above his knees. It also shortened its width, ending up with dimensions only about as thick as his thigh.\n\"It's an ability of the belt.\" Aina explained simply, leaving it at that.\nLeonel nodded. He used the strap of the man who previously owned the spear to hold it to his back, then fitted the small round shield to his left arm.\nSensing that Leonel was ready, Aina took off, knowing that Leonel was following closely behind.\nLeonel tacitly understood his role, this was why he put his spear away.\n[Aina Brazinger]\n[Strength: 0.99; Speed: 0.85; Agility: 0.80; Coordination: 0.95; Stamina: 0.95; Reactions: 0.97; Spirit: 0.06]\nAina's stats hadn't changed much since he last looked. She was fundamentally a front line fighter. In that case, it was his responsibility as the only one among them adept at long ranged attacks to cover her.\nHowever, he was curious. Aina's Spirit was the highest he'd seen aside from his own. Even the Priest was only at 0.05. Maybe he was still underestimating her.\nThe two ran through the small village in a line, just ten meters apart, their speed far beyond that of normal humans.\nAina's ax was suddenly wrapped in a reddish-gold glow and floated from her back to her hand. She held it off to her side with two hands, sweeping out the moment she entered the range of an enemy.\nHer ax was like a blur, hacking Englishmen apart with ease.\nBlood and organs splattered through the air, but not a speck touched her as she flashed by, dodging them as though they hadn't dared approach her.\nLeonel could only sigh as he watched her silently. He always knew there was something special about Aina. There were simple context clues everywhere. Something as simple as her tanned skin could tell him this.\nGirls her age were obsessed with taking care of their skin. Some used tans for cosmetic reasons, but Aina's had always been a level beyond that, as though she spent her days toiling under the sun. Yet, she didn't appear any less elegant or noble, always appearing in a beautiful dress like a dainty goddess.\nHis infatuation had always been due to small tidbits of her hidden truth like that. He had originally thought that her 'abrupt change' would lessen his feelings for her. But, even as she slaughtered mindlessly, he felt that he had always subconsciously known this was hidden within her.\n'Is this what I'm drawn to…?'\nLeonel's gaze sharpened. With quick movements, he pulled a dart out from his side, hooking it into his atlatl and swinging his arm sidelong.\nHe continued running as though nothing had happened. But, 100 meters away, an archer watched as Leonel's spear flew through a window, out a wall, and directly between his eyes. He hadn't even managed to climb to a proper vantage point, let alone knock an arrow.\nLeonel wasn't fond of killing. But, even in his aversion, those who would attack a village of innocents like this ranked at the top of those he would be willing to bloody his hands with.\nAina and Leonel just numbered two. But in less than ten minutes, the state of the battle completely flipped. They dashed around the village like two specters, Aina manning the front and Leonel taking out everything out of her range.\n'Once again, this Zone seems mostly made up of normal humans.. This era should have gunpowder as well, but they probably won't appear on this battlefield..'\nThe blaring horns of retreat sounded just as Leonel and Aina burst out of the village's boundary of broken wooden fences.\nA plain that should have held crops stood. But much of it was trampled to the ground under the hooves of swords and foot soldiers. With such conditions, the likelihood this village would survive through the winter even with Aina and Leonel's actions were near zero.\nLeonel's jaw clenched.\nThe surviving village dwellers looked toward Aina and Leonel as though they were twin gods, none of them daring to approach.\nAt that time, long after the English had disappeared over the horizon, the sound of hooves filled Leonel's ears. However, this time, it came from within the village. No, more accurately, it should have been another army approaching from the opposite exit and cutting through the village.\nAs expected, Leonel soon found a group of armored men riding horses coming toward both he and Aina, causing the village members to part like the sea. Except, this time, they weren't Englishmen but were rather Frenchmen.\nThe head knight looked down toward Aina and Leonel from his horse, a picture of confusion with a dash of arrogance.\n'Who are you?'\nThe question was directed toward Leonel despite the massive ax in Aina's hand. It seemed this era still took their misogyny quite seriously.\n\"… I can't speak French.\" Aina said, looking toward Leonel.\nLeonel blinked. He had become so used to not being able to understand anyone after entering a Zone that he forgot he could actually speak French. Finally, it seemed his language studies would come in handy.\nLeonel thought for a minute. What was the best way to approach this… Suddenly, he smirked.\n\"We're messengers of God. Me and my partner are guardians sent to protect Joan of Arc. Bring us to her immediately.\"\nThe head knight frowned. He wanted to refute, but there was only one reason the English would retreat. It had to be related to these two.\n\"I will take you to the General. Whether you can meet the Savior or not will be up to him. Bring them a horse!\"\nAina frowned seeing that there was just one horse. Plus, there was no way a horse would be capable of withstanding the weight of her ax.\n\"It's fine, lead the way. We will run.\"\nThe head knight's eyes widened. Humans keeping up with horses?\n\"The… the path is long…\"\nLeonel only shrugged, slotting his atlatl into the belt Aina had given him.\n\"The messengers of God aren't limited by such things.\"\nThe heart of the knights trembled, each of them swallowing hard. Their encampment was 50 kilometers away. It would take a human a day to cover such a distance. A good runner would take about three to four hours. But, a horse could do it in less than two. If they could really keep up…\nThey soon received their answer.\nAina and Leonel not only kept up with ease despite their heavy load. On top of this, they didn't seem to be too tired. Leonel could have taken out his bike to make the process even easier on himself, but it didn't sit right with him letting Aina run alone.\nWhen they could see the large tents of the encampment, Leonel's heart inadvertently thumped as something clicked in his mind.\n'My stamina just increased by 0.01…'\nLeonel immediately confirmed that he really was correct. There was something more special about his father's concoctions than the latter had let on. In addition, this world really hadn't blocked it like the previous Zone had.\n'What's different about that one and this one? It also seems that whatever medicinal strength dad's brew had can be forced out quicker if I'm doing an activity conducive to it… Should I start running sprints and lifting weight?'\nLeonel's strength wasn't bad, but his speed and agility were abysmal. The only reason they were passable currently was due to the Tier 5 Black treasure on his feet currently.\nNow that Leonel was paying very close attention to his body, he realized that the ticks up in his stats while he was fighting those A-grade Invalids had felt exactly like this. Why hadn't he realized there was a hidden strength churning in his body before?\n'I wonder why dad decided on this incredibly slow approach… I'm sure he had a reason…'\nLeonel frowned, his mind going to the scar his father mentioned. Could it be related to that? He didn't really understand, though. There weren't really any important organs or vitals in that place.\nLeonel didn't get to think more about it as they finally made it to the encampment. He could immediately tell that Joan of Arc wouldn't be here. Encampments like this one held forward squads and battalions that placed pressure on the enemy in no-man's-land.\nAccording to history, Joan wasn't a fighter, she was rather a morale booster. The so-called 'Merlin' mentioned in the quest introduction was the man who prophesied of her arrival, but there was no real wizard or mage in history.\nThis was all to say that Joan wouldn't be in such a small army. She would be with a larger number so her presence could have the greatest effect.\n'Joan of Arc was executed for cross dressing as a man…' Leonel sighed, looking at Aina's clothing.\nLeonel found his education at Royal Blue Academy to be quite useful currently. When one chooses a language study, it isn't just about learning the dialect itself, but also about learning in the language. Leonel had thus learned many things about French history in these past few years.\nLeonel and Aina waited patiently as the head knight contacted who he needed to. Not long later, the two were being ushered into the largest center tent.\nUnsurprisingly, this 'general' didn't have much of a say in the matter either. He could only wait until the next opportunity to bring Aina and Leonel back to the Orleans stronghold.\nThe next time their battalion would be allowed to return was a month. Until then, they could only continue fighting skirmishes and protecting the 100 kilometer radius of villages and towns.\nFollowing this, Aina and Leonel were taken to a tent of their own. Leonel already knew that Aina had a tent of her own that she'd likely bring out, so he didn't disagree. Plus, it wasn't particularly good for the two of them to separate.\nSurprisingly, though, Aina didn't immediately pull out her own living space and instead invited Leonel to sit on an animal skin left in the tent.\n\"The mission specifics, I haven't had time to explain them properly to you yet, so I think I should do so now while we have a small bit of time.\"\nLeonel nodded, that was true.\n\"The wrist watch is correct. This quest is about Joan of Arc. I'm not sure how this Merlin is related, but maybe you can fill in the blanks?\"\n\"Yes. Merlin was a bard and professed prophet from the 500's. He was known for a few of his connections and prophecies, namely his connection with King Arthur and his prophecy on Joan of Arc.\n\"If I recall the quote directly, his prophecy went… 'France will be lost by a woman and saved by a virgin from the oak forests of Lorraine.'\n\"The same usual vague prophecy that will eventually become true if enough years pass…\" Leonel ended a bit skeptically.\n\"I don't think we can take anything at surface value like that anymore.\" Aina said softly.\n\"… Maybe you're right.\"\nAina shook her head. \"The main quest and side quests are actually conflicting. And, the hidden quest is nearly impossible.\"\n\"You can see hidden quests? Isn't the point that they're… hidden?\"\n\"My detection device can't, but I used an S-grade Information Ticket on it. I have a feeling that this quest may actually be of the SS-grade, which plummets the accuracy of my device to just 70%.\"\nLeonel's gaze narrowed in his seriousness. He had only completed a C-grade Zone before, but now he was in an SS-grade one? Where was the fairness?\n\"There's also a possibility that it's a Unique Sub-Dimensional Zone.\"\n\"Unique…?\"\n\"They're Zones that are ungraded due to the fact the variables within follow the Chaos Theory.\"\n'Oh… Just fantastic…' Leonel thought to himself. Chaos Theory was a branch of mathematics that gave even him a headache whenever he thought about it. At least back when his mind worked within normal human limits, that is.\n\"Either way, I will tell you what I know.\n\"There are two side quests. One is to kill 1000 Englishmen. The second is to kill 10 000 Englishmen.\n\"The main quest is to… kill Joan of Arc.\"\nLeonel rubbed his forehead with a hand. As expected, this wasn't a simple matter at all.\n\"The hidden quest is to recapture Paris.\"\nLeonel's lips twitched. She was the 'Boss' of a potentially SS-grade Zone, yet even she failed to recapture Paris in her lifetime. But, they were supposed to?",

She cradled the long arm of her ax in her bosom, the soft sounds of her steady breathing soon following.\nLeonel blinked for a moment. With will power he didn't know he had, he forced himself to look away from the elegant curve of her back and…\n'Focus, focus… You have a lot of work to do.'\nLeonel had spent all his life avoiding women. In middle school, he simply wasn't interested in them aside from the usual teasing a boy might have for the opposite sex at that age. And, when it came to high school and he finally realized that girls were more interesting than he thought, he caught sight of Aina. No… It was more accurate to say that she was the reason he found women were worth looking at.\nWith how popular Leonel had been as a Five-Star Professional, the women who wanted him could form a line that wrapped around Earth. But his father's two mantras had always been respect and persistence. If he wanted to respect Aina, even if they weren't a couple, he had to at least do the bare minimum.\nLike this, Leonel, who had a friend like James who had probably lost count of the number of women he had been with, was a green virgin. Something like being in a tent barely four meters in every direction with the only woman who stirred his heart was too much stimulation for him to handle.\nTo clear his mind, Leonel began to subconsciously circulate [Dimensional Cleanse]. Without having to worry about Invalids, he unleashed his talent completely. Those who could only be considered normal humans felt a comfortable and warm, yet strong wind picking up.\nThe flaps of open tents whipped back and forth. The horses, in their makeshift stables, neighed, hot air billowing from their nostrils. It almost seemed like a gentle summer's day despite the fact they were deep into fall and quickly approaching winter.\nAs for those who weren't normal…\nAina's eyes flashed open, an unconcealed shock hidden within. But she didn't turn back. Instead, she closed her eyes once more, feeling comforted. A light smile Leonel couldn't see played her delicate features.\n'The energy density in this place is severely lacking compared to the current Earth… Is that the difference between a world that's begun its evolution and one that hasn't?'\nDespite the low energy density, Leonel's speed was still much faster than it had been when he was constantly worrying about Invalids. In fact, he felt that it was faster than it should have been.\n'My speed increased more than it should. That's probably related to my increase in spirit?'\nEventually, Leonel's mind slipped away. By the time he awoke again, the sun had set and risen.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.80; Speed: 0.75 (+0.1); Agility: 0.85 (+0.1); Coordination: 0.99; Stamina: 0.87 (+0.05); Reactions: 0.99; Spirit: 0.12]\nLeonel's spirit had risen once more, this time by 0.1. He couldn't help but smile to himself. Before, three days had netted him some small improvement due to his forceful slowing of his own progress. But, now that he had unleashed his full potential, he gained such a large amount in a little over 12 hours. He was immensely satisfied.\nBy now, Aina had awoken. Her back still faced to him, she was meditating as well. It seemed that she wasn't able to meditate and sleep like Leonel could. In addition, whatever technique it was that she was practicing, it relied entirely on the goings on of her own body. There was no energy entering her from the outside at all.\nLeonel noticed a tray of food in front of him and nodded a thanks Aina couldn't see. It wasn't nearly enough food for him, but he couldn't expect an encampment of a thousand men to have too much to spare.\nAfter wolfing down the porridge and sausage, Leonel set the tray aside, thinking of going hunting for his own food as he had in the Mayan temple. However, not wanting to leave Aina alone, he thought against it.\n'It's rare that I have time to calm myself and think. It's already been four days since I received those two booklets, yet I've yet to even open them.'\nIf Montez heard Leonel's thoughts, he would go numb from shock.\nIf Leonel had never opened the technique booklets, how was it that he had used both [Dimensional Cleanse] and [Call of the Wind]?!\nUnfortunately for Uncle Montez's sanity, Leonel's answer would be the same shrug he used after he chose [Dimensional Cleanse] over the other four Tier 9 Black techniques.\nWhen Leonel laid hands on the booklets, the things he could already sense with his eyes were magnified several times over. He got an instinctual feel for the existence of the technique without even opening its cover. That first night he spent with his friends after coming back, he found that he could simply use them with ease.\nWhen Leonel realized this, he refrained from reading through the techniques. He felt that in such a dangerous environment, since he could already use them without issue, there was no point in risking anything now to read them. After all, he couldn't meditate and rest if he had to read.\nFinally, Leonel pulled out [Dimensional Cleanse] and flipped open to the first page. The first thing he saw was a summary of the technique.\n'Dimensional Cleanse. This technique attunes the body to the shift in Dimensions, using Fourth Grade Force to wash Third Dimensional Constitutions and bring them closer to Perfection.'\n'Fourth Grade Force? Is that what it's called?'\nLeonel realized immediately how important this booklet was. He didn't have enough fundamental knowledge about his quickly changing world. The more he knew, the better system he could build in his mind. Then, there'd be less variables to contend with.\n'But this 'perfection', what is it that they mean by that?' Leonel kept reading.\n'The completion stages of this technique are graded from One Star Cleansed Body to Three Star Cleansed Body.\n'If you succeed in forging a One Star Cleansed Body, congratulations. You are one of the foremost talents in your world. Should you help your plane continue to evolve, you have the potential to form a Seventh Dimensional Constitution. You can be considered amongst the 1%.\n'If you succeed in forging a Two Star Cleansed Body, I praise you whole heartedly. You are a generational genius of your time, a God amongst men. Should your world continue to evolve, you have the potential to form an Eighth Dimensional Constitution. You can be consider the 1% of the 1%.\n'If you succeed in forging a Three Star Cleansed Body, I hope you'll remember the Karma we've forged on this day.'\n'So a Three Star Cleansed Body is this 'Perfection' they're talking about?'\nLeonel wasn't sure. Even the lowest completion of One Star received such high praise. If that was the case, then what sort of existence was the Three Star Cleansed Body.\nShaking his head, Leonel could only continue.\n'Internal Sight.\n'Before any Force technique can be cultivated, Internal Sight must be mastered. If you do not have the talent to awaken this ability, I advise you to place down this technique. Once you advance to gain a Fourth Dimensional Constitution, you will naturally awaken Internal Sight and you can then choose another Force Technique.'\n'Internal Sight is a subconscious, instinctual grasp of the Force not only in the world around you, but within you as well. Without the ability to both sense this energy and also guide it into your body, the quest for Perfection is simply not in your destiny.\n'Force Nodes.'\nLeonel turned the page to find a diagram of the human body. From his biology studies, there were several points off from the humans of Earth. But the creator of this technique wrote diligent notes on how to adjust his diagrams to fit the evolutionary quirks of each world.\n'Force Nodes are the points in the body that generate and propagate Force. They do not exist naturally in Third Dimensional Constitutions. Instead, they must be formed either through the use of techniques such as this one, or naturally as a world evolves.\n'Cultivated Force Nodes are neither inferior or superior to Natural Force Nodes. The only exception to this are individuals able to forge Natural Force Nodes of a higher rank than their current world's Dimensional Plane. However, these individuals are incredibly rare and are usually World Spirit wielders, or the offspring of one.\n'In addition to this, the better the foundation technique, the better your Cultivated Force Nodes of the future will be. My Dimensional Cleanse technique can be considered among the best, so you are in luck.'\nLeonel refrained from rolling his eyes. You hadn't even finished the technique when you wrote this, how could you possibly know that? What a narcissistic creator.\nAs Leonel continued to read, he found a few differences from his expectations.\nFor one, due to the fact he hadn't formed even a single Force Node and was just cultivating Force by instinct, what he was doing now was 'Priming' his body. According to the creator, the longer one could 'Prime', the higher chance they had at forging a Three Star Cleansed Body.\nFrom what Leonel could see, he had already begun to pass the thresholds necessary to enter those completion realms. The creator described that state as 'Force infused into the brain'. Leonel had already naturally accomplished this.\nThe second thing that subverted his expectations was that unlike those anime he and his dad liked to watch, the core of Force techniques wasn't at his lower belly, but was rather in his mind. The reason 'Force infused into the brain' was so important was because this was where the Stars would form. The more resilient the mind, the higher chance there was at success.\nThe third thing was that Leonel felt he could already form Two Stars without issue. But the fact he could exposed to him just how difficult it was to form Three. He felt that it was an astronomical distance away despite the fact he had reached the Two Star threshold so easily.\nThe fourth thing Leonel began to contemplate was on just what his ability truly was, then… According to the description of Internal Sight, it matched the way he had used his ability all along.\nCould it be he had mistaken Internal Sight for his ability? If that was the case, then what was his actual ability, then? It couldn't be that his ability was something everyone would receive eventually… right?\nLeonel could only set these thoughts aside. The more he cultivated [Dimensional Cleanse], the stronger his ability would become. By then, he'd know the truth. If it was more potent, he'd be able to get a rid on it much easier.\n'Alright, there are multiple options from where to start forming Force Nodes. If I want to gather enough Force to form the first Star, I need three Nodes. Six Nodes for two. And nine Nodes for the third and final. But, it's very difficult for a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional body to withstand that many nodes even if my brain can withstand Two Stars already.\n'The most dangerous starting position is the brain stem… the easiest is the calf. However, starting at the calf will make your Nodes about a tenth the size of their full potential. The further the starting position from the brain, the longer the path you need to forge, and thus the less energy you can spend on widening your Node.\n'The closer to the brain you start, the less energy you need to spend on the path, and the more you can spend on widening your Node. The wider the starting Node, the more Force it can withstand. Since your first Node acts as a pathway to your second Node, the same principle applies, so the closer the second Node is to it, and the larger that first Node is… the larger the second will be…\n'In that case, what I need to focus on is reaching saturation in my Priming stage. After this, I'll form my first Node at my brain stem!'\nLike this, three weeks passed and Leonel's brain had finally reached its full capacity.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.80; Speed: 0.75 (+0.1); Agility: 0.85 (+0.1); Coordination: 0.99; Stamina: 0.87 (+0.05); Reactions: 0.99; Spirit: 0.30]",

      "content": "Leonel hadn't moved in weeks. He wasn't even consciously aware of the fact that Aina had left and come back several times already. Without any strong threats around him, and subconsciously putting his trust in her, he went all out.\nDue to the strong winds and comfort that emitted from his tent, the Frenchmen hadn't dared to approach. By now, they were all convinced that he was an envoy of God.\nAina entered the tent once more. But this time, she frowned deeply seeing his current state.\nLeonel's lips were a deep shade of blue, his body quaking with every passing second. The whirlwind of Force surging toward him was more than ten times greater than it had been on the first day. Whether that was due to the increase in his Spirit, or due to the fact he had a deeper understanding of the technique after actually reading it, it was impossible to tell.\nGhastly blue-green veins ran across Leonel's neck and forehead. Beads of sweat rolled down his body, mixing in with the foul odor it was giving off. If Leonel knew that Aina had continuously dealt with his body odor without a complaint for so many weeks, who knew how he'd feel.\nIf one peered into Leonel's brain stem, it would be possible to see a growing seed of concentrated Force. There was no simple way to complete this process. Leonel had to carve out his own flesh while simultaneously using Force to heal himself.\nThis was why this step was so dangerous. The brain stem was arguably the most important part of the brain. If it was ever damaged, death was basically guaranteed. Yet, Leonel had to actively do exactly that to carve out a Node for himself.\nThe only way this was possible was due to the special characteristic of [Dimensional Cleanse]. Not every Force technique would carve out Nodes in the same places, and most directly avoided such dangerous areas. It was precisely because the creator of this technique was so confident in his methods that he dared pen down this technique.\n'Use your senses to perfectly memorize the structure of cells in your brain stem… reorganize… stimulate their recreation… destroy the original… repeat…'\nIt took hundreds of years of research before humans of Earth were able to use stem cells to reproduce brain cells. In fact, it was still in its infant stages even now. Yet, this technique was able to use Force to surpass anything Earth was capable of.\nHowever, it was still up to Leonel in the end to repeat this process countless times. It was simply impossible for him to do this for every one of the millions of cells in his brain stem. That said, a normal Node formed of Fourth Grade Force would barely be visible to the naked eye and could have its size measured in cubic micrometers.\nThe issue Leonel faced was that his Node was not normal. And, though a normal Node would only take up the space of about 10 cells at most, the true difficultly came in properly restructuring everything so that your mind could continue to function properly.\nThat alone was already difficult… But Leonel had to replace and reorganize not just 10 cells… But 100!\nOn any other day, a mere paper cut could slice across far more than 100 human cells with ease. But to Leonel, that seemingly small number was the barrier between him and death.\nHe knew he could have stopped at 10, that he could have stopped at 20, even at 50… These numbers were already far more than a normal person could match. And, it should also be considered that [Dimensional Cleanse] wasn't a normal technique to begin with, another technique might have their user form a Node of five cells at most!\nBut, Leonel knew that if he stopped, he would be cheating himself. What had he wasted so much time Priming himself for if he wasn't going to tap into his full potential? If he stopped now, then he might as well have formed his first Node back when his Spirit was at 0.12.\nBlood began to leak from Leonel's nose. It was such a deep crimson that it almost appeared black.\nThe calculations running through Leonel's mind were astronomical. Just how many other neurons did 100 brain stem cells connect to? How many spinal connections? How many smooth muscle connections? How many organs did they control?\nRerouting his whole body like this put immense pressure on his mind. He just wanted to sleep, to alleviate that pain racking his body, but he knew he couldn't.\n'Persistence…'\nHis back straightened. He realized now that the reason he fought those seven A-grade Invalids wasn't because of some random excuse, it was because of something his father had ingrained in his body since he was young.\nPersist.\nAina stood at the doorway, her teeth biting down hard on her soft lips.\n'He's forming his first Node now? How is that possible? He should at the very least be on his fifth or sixth… Is his high coordination and reaction purely due to his ability then? What kind of ability is that?'\nAina obviously didn't have access to the same stats Leonel self-created. But, she had a natural ability to read people that came from years of training and experience. From her experience, it was simply impossible to have such high 'base stats' without first forging Nodes. She herself was already working on her seventh.\nIn fact, the base strength she displayed wasn't her full strength. Because she rarely used her Force, the stats Leonel had of her were actually wrong. After all, he can only measure what he can see, and he had too little knowledge of Force before.\nThe only point that stood now, however, was the fact Leonel's ability, whatever it was, was actually so great…\nSuddenly, a roar escaped Leonel's lips, a shower of blood bursting from the pores of his body.\nIn the next moment, the sound of something that almost resembled a massive flame being lit swept through. Concentric circles of rippling force winds and dust billowed around him, shooting the tent he sat into the sky.\nLeonel opened his eyes with a flash, their hazel burning with a deep blue light that flickered and disappeared a moment later.\nHe was a complete mess. His body was coated in blood from head to toe. In fact, the his general vicinity looked as though a concentrated rain of blood had fallen, splattering around gruesomely.\nHowever, if one looked closely, one could see that this wasn't normal blood. It had an impure, brownish-black quality to it that released a terrible smell. At that moment, despite his looks, Leonel felt more alive than he ever had.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.80; Speed: 0.75 (+0.1); Agility: 0.85 (+0.1); Coordination: 1.00; Stamina: 0.87 (+0.05); Reactions: 1.00; Spirit: 0.30]\nThat was it. He had crossed the limits the human body could theoretically endure!\nHis other stats hadn't improved, but this made sense. After all, it was a Node for his brain, not his body. They only had minor ticks up. But, Leonel knew that if he activated the Force in his first Node, his stats would increase by another margin.\n'… Seems I've missed something important…' Leonel reprimanded himself.\n\"You stink.\" Aina's soothing voice appeared above Leonel sitting form.\nLeonel was speechless. But, looking down at himself and taking a whiff, even he could only cringe.\nSweeping out his senses, he quickly found the nearest water source.\n\"Come with me.\" Leonel said.\nAina raised an eyebrow.\nLeonel grinned. \"It's alright. I'm okay with you taking advantage of me.\"\nIt was Aina's turn to be speechless. In the end she turned and blushed, not meeting Leonel's eyes.\nAt that moment, Leonel couldn't hide the confusion in his heart. He had thought that Aina's bashful personality was all just an act, not different from how Yuri pretended to be the kind, considerate friend for so many years. But what was this?\n\"Leaving you here doesn't sit well with me. Come on.\" Leonel dashed away.\nAfter seeing that he wasn't scrutinizing her anymore, Aina quickly followed. By the time she caught up, Leonel was already stripping by a riverside. Flustered, she could only find a tree to sit behind in the opposite direction.\nAina's militaristic outfit didn't have any defensive abilities. All it had were its convenient pockets that allowed her to store many things like miniature spatial devices, and the real reason she chose it: a self-cleaning function.\nShe liked to stay clean, but she was also practical. Finding a place to bathe in a Zone or even on Earth right now was near impossible. So though she missed the feeling of water gliding across her soft skin, she gave it up.\n\"Do you think they'll be alright without us?\"\nLeonel's voice traveled to Aina's as he alternated between scrubbing himself and his clothes.\n\"They'll be fine…\" Aina said softly. \"… Yuri knows what to do. Plus, only the Beginner Zone works on the same timeline. The Zone we're in currently is ten to one. Not even three days have passed to them yet.\"\n\"Oh. I didn't know that.\" Leonel muttered.\nAina always seemed to speak to him as if the things she was saying were obvious. Did she not realize that he had no idea what she was talking about?\nLeonel frowned. 'Uncle Montez said that because Earth had so much potential, there were several other worlds looking to get a piece of the pie… His words seemed to imply that they had started doing this even before the Metamorphosis began… Could Aina's family be related to this?'\n\"Did you really only just light your first Node?\"\nAfter several moments of silence, Aina's sweet voice traveled to his ears again.\n\"You know about Nodes?\" Leonel asked, surprised.\n\"Did you think you were the only one?\" Leonel could almost hear the light smile through Aina's voice. He could barely hold back his desire to see it.\n\"Sort of… I had to do a lot to get my hands on the method. I didn't think others were already aware.\"\nLeonel wasn't lying. He only got [Dimensional Cleanse] because he was the first to clear a Zone, and as such, he received a Tier 9 Black reward. There could only be one of him, right?\nBut, it seemed he forgot to consider that a Force technique didn't have to be such high grade. And, also, from Uncle Montez's words, maybe others had gotten their hands on treasures through other means. Maybe that was why Aina seemed to have more treasures on hand than she should.\n\"I did just light my first one.\" Leonel eventually answered. \"I chose my brain stem as my first location, so it was pretty dangerous. I should have prepared some more.\"\nAina froze. \"What did you just say?\"\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. \"That I chose my brain —\"\n\"Are you insane?!\"\n\"Uh…\" How was he supposed to respond to that? \"… Maybe?\"\n\"Maybe?! Why didn't you just pick a spot on your legs?! You can only choose nine locations at best, and most can't even form a second. Recklessly choosing your brain now is not only dangerous, but if you reach a bottleneck in your potential, your bodily strength will always be substandard!\"\nLeonel could hear Aina almost huffing and puffing. It seemed the Aina who could curse out a grown man three times her size had come out. He was too angry to see it that night, but he was sure it was an adorable sight.\n\"I knew I should have woken you up…\" Aina bit her lip again.\n\"You shouldn't do that, you'll scar your lip.\"\nAina was shocked awake from her own rant, finding Leonel standing before her with wet, dripping hair. It was fine if he wanted to come, but did he really have to do it shirtless?\n\"… You don't understand. The bottlenecks people face get worse and worse with every step. Unless you're lucky enough to be born with a Lineage Factor that gives you Natural Force Nodes, reaching past the third Node is impossible. You would need Force Node medicines, but Earth just can't produce those now.\"\nLeonel smiled. \"You don't have to worry about me.\"\nIt was a smile he had practiced in the front of the mirror so many times, the very smile he prepared just for this one person.\nSeeing Aina completely disarmed, he felt a swelling of satisfaction in his heart.\n'Whoever that old fart is who wrote [Dimensional Cleanse] really is a liar. No difference between Cultivated and Natural Force Nodes my ass. You could have at least mentioned this in a footnote you ass.'\nAfter recovering, Aina's expression turned serious once more.\n\"It's good that you know that I'm worrying. In that case, be less reckless and choose your right arm for your next Node. It will improve your throwing abilities by a large margin.\"\nLeonel nodded innocently like an obedient child, but internally he had no intention of listening.\nAfter awakening his first Node, Leonel gained a greater grasp of just what his ability was. If he had to sum it up in one word it was… Calculation.\nIn the simplest terms, his mind was like a supercomputer. The reason why he had almost mistaken Internal Sight for his ability was precisely because of his mind's ability to make use of that information far better than anyone else would be able to.\nIt was the reason he could tell the difference between a loaded and unloaded gun by its weight. It was the reason he could assign 'stats' just by glancing at a person's body. And it was the reason he was certain that there was a perfect configuration of Nodes that would maximize his body's potential.\nHe had accidentally stumbled into the perfect start with his brain stem and he didn't plan on taking the second until he had gathered enough knowledge to find the next perfect step.\nThat said, he had already eliminated his arms, legs, and most of his chest. He was certain that the perfect second Node was along his spine somewhere, he just had to run a few more calculations to find that flawless location.\nAs for Aina's worries. Well… What she didn't know wouldn't hurt her.\n'Aina seems to be preparing to form her seventh Force Node. Her Node locations actually have 93% compatibility with her, I didn't expect that. Oh!'\n\"What are you doing?\" Aina frowned as she gazed at Leonel. She felt for a moment that she had been stripped bare in front of him, but she couldn't find a logical reason why. Leonel's spirit was just too far above hers. Had he not been standing right in front of her, she might not have even noticed.\nLeonel snapped out of his thoughts. He had just seen something that explained to him why it was Aina seemed to cultivate without pulling in Force Energy. She was actually practicing a technique aside from a Force technique, one that applied particular pressure on her blood.\nHowever, Leonel knew instinctually he couldn't practice this technique. Only those with Aina's blood could…\n'Just what's her story exactly…?'\n\"Sorry, just committing your words to memory!\" Leonel saluted like a soldier.\n\"Pft —\" Aina laughed beside herself. It was such a dazzling scene that Leonel stood completely frozen in time.\n'… I bet she didn't have to practice that in front of a mirror…'\nJust then, the sounds of war horns reached their ears.\nSending a glance toward each other, they dashed back to the war camp.",

      "content": "As he ran, Leonel squeezed his still wet flexible armor on. Its black fabric flexed, clinging tightly to his body. Luckily, he hadn't been foolish enough to leave his weapons behind. No matter how uneventful the last month had been, Leonel would never forget that he was in the middle of a Sub-Dimensional Zone.\nThe idea of time dilation sounded great. Thanks to Zones, Leonel would be able to experience more life than his lifespan dictated, and even train faster than he should. But Zones were not a joke. If the main quest couldn't be accomplished, they'd be stuck here to their deaths. Only then would the Zone open once more to allow another to try.\nA Zone wasn't a place that could be taken casually. If there was anything Leonel had learned in the Mayan temple, it was that.\nThe two, Leonel and Aina, hadn't traveled more than a kilometer from the campsite. It took them less than two minutes to return, finding the group of thousand men quickly organizing.\nLeonel got a read on the situation quickly. It seemed that a scout had caught wind of an approaching English army, bearing down on Orleans.\nFrom what Leonel knew, Orleans was one of the first if not the very first battle Joan of Arc had fought in and won. It was an important city on the edge of what remained of French territory and what was once French territory but now English territory. Back then, or what was considered right now, it was unprecedented and skyrocketed her fame upward.\nHowever, with such a critical loss, and to a woman no less, it wasn't a surprise that the English would try and take it back as soon as possible. It was just bad luck that this encampment happened to be in their way.\nThe smart decision was to retreat and send a messenger ahead to warn Joan and Orleans. The encampment had likely already done the latter, but for some reason they weren't doing the first.\n\"If we retreat now, the common people are finished. We must hold out for as long as we can.\"\nLeonel's gaze flickered. Ultimately, knights were still nobles. Though France had run into a problem of lacking enough land to consecrate these knights properly during this era, this fact still remained. How rare was it for a noble to care about the common people in this time?\n'I've never heard of this General Franck before, likely because his name had been washed out of history maybe due to this very act here. But his actions are commendable…'\nLeonel looked toward Aina. \"I'm going to help them. You're a front line fighter so you'll be at too much risk if you jump into such a lopsided fight, just stay next to me.\"\nLeonel was well aware that both he and Aina had surpassed the limit of humans, but they weren't gods. They still got tired, they could still get injured, and they were more than susceptible to overwhelming numbers.\nAina looked toward Leonel blankly for a moment before shaking her head.\n\"If you don't want me to die, then you'll just have to put a bit of extra effort into covering for me.\"\nHer voice still carried the same gentleness, but it had an unyielding command to it. Leonel felt that her will was far stronger than his own.\nLeonel closed his eyes. If they were open, it would be possible to see a deep flicker within them.\n\"General Franck. Do you have any siege engineers with you? Or any who have experience working with them?\"\n\"Well… yes. We need a few to properly fortify our encampment.\"\n\"Good. Give them to me and a few men to chop down some wood. You build your defenses.\"\nQuite frankly, the general was much too scared of Leonel to refuse.\nWhen the engineers heard of Leonel's asks, they looked at him weirdly. The request wasn't difficult at all. In fact, it was ridiculously easy. They could easily complete the three of them Leonel asked for by the time the Englishmen were in range.\n\"After you finish chopping down the trees the engineers need, continue and build at least 50 Cheval de Frise afterward…\"\n\"Cheval de frise?\"\nLeonel patted his forehead, had such a thing not been invented yet? Without the proper experience, finishing 50 like he hoped would be impossible. Unless…\n'Simplify the design…' Leonel's mind churned. In a flash, he had an idea that could work.\nWalking to the sparse forest of trees that surrounded a part of the river he had bathed in, he borrowed an ax and cut down a thin tree with a diameter no larger than about eight inches.\nHe worked swiftly, leading by example.\nHe separated the length of the tree into portions about a meter and a half long. Then, cut those portions widthwise into fourths. In the end, from a single tree, he managed to get eight total meter and a half length pieces.\nBrandishing the ax, his began to chip away at both ends of these pieces. Eventually, they ended up looking like double headed spears, albeit much thicker than a spear should be.\n\"A Cheval de Frise is a device capable of nullifying calvary. It stops the charging of horses by placing deadly barriers in their path. Even if the calvary men are aware of their danger and avoid them, it will slow down their charge and disrupt their formation. If they aren't aware of them, the result will be even more devastating.\n\"I want you to do exactly as I did after you've prepared what the engineers need. Then…\"\nLeonel slammed three of the double ended spears he created into the soil at an angle, just about a foot or so apart.\n\"Press them into the ground just like this in sets of three. Work in lines that cover the battle in a systematic way. Between every set of three, leave about two meters of space. And lay out a single line to extend about 100 meters.\n\"When you finish laying a line of 100 meters, move back about five meters and begin a new line, but don't place them in the same positions as the first line, or else the enemy can just charge straight through the gaps. Make it so that even if an enemy makes it past, they must swerve and slow themselves down continuously.\n\"Do you understand?\"\nThe warriors nodded fervently, jetting off to their work. They were a bit skeptical of how just laying down spikes could stop a calvary, but much like their general, they were too scared to refute.\nAgainst Leonel's expectations, General Franck actually committed a hundred men to Leonel's cause. Leonel hadn't thought he'd receive such support, so he had asked for very little. But he had underestimated their religious fanaticism. If they weren't like this, why else would they trust a small village girl like Joan with their lives?\nBy the time Leonel's sharp gaze could see the Englishmen over the horizon, marching under the high sunlight in perfect rectangular formations, the battlefield was already set.\n'It's as perfect as it can be.' Leonel thought to himself. 'The river to our back only has one shallow enough point to cross within tens of miles, they have no choice but to come through here… The encampment itself was already chosen to be on a small hill to act as a temporary fortress… And everything is in my line of sight…'\nLeonel climbed to the top of a set of a wooden staircases.\nThis was the device he had asked the siege engineers to build. It was nothing but a simple elevated platform. From afar it looked like a staircase that led nowhere.\nIt could be considered to be a simplified siege tower. The differences lied in the fact that there were no castle walls to scale here and it was a great deal shorter than what it would usually be. But, for Leonel's purposes, this height was enough, especially with the help of the elevated position of the encampment.\nAll around the destinationless staircase, barrels of crudely made spears lied. Leonel knew that he could work faster to complete what he had asked of the Frenchmen, but he had spent all of this time forming thousands of spears. He hadn't had the luxury of helping them.\nA small encampment like this one wouldn't carry so many weapons with them. He could only make them on his own.\nWhen he reached the top, there was only a single barrel filled with about a hundred. Unfortunately, this was all he could fit without impeding his throwing motion. The space was quite small, only about a meter and a half in width and two in length, so he had to make do.\nHe picked up a crude wooden spear, weighing it in his hands.\nA sigh escaped his lips. Only he would be mad enough to try and throw such a poorly weighted weapon. But there hadn't been time to build any stabilizers for them. He could only rely on his ability.\nThe Englishmen stopped in the distance. There was clear disdain on their faces when they noticed the numbers before them. There were 20 000 of them, yet the enemy wanted to face them with a measly 1000?\nThe spikes pierced into the ground were incredibly conspicuous, but what did little branches in the ground mean to their heavy calvary?\n\"FORM UP!\"\nThe roar brought an eerie silence to the Frenchmen. They gripped their weapons and shields tightly to the point their knuckles went white beneath their armor.\nAnd that was when it happened.\nA small woman of beauty beyond words leaped through the skies and landed before them all with her back facing them. Her demeanor was almost lackadaisical, a massive ax dragging across the ground to her side.\n\"It seems we're in luck, men. That Whore who claims to be of God is right before us. Slay her here and take revenge for our fallen brothers!\"\n\"Revenge for our fallen brothers!!\" The roar was deafening.\nIn this era, women didn't even touch the battlefield, let alone taking the vanguard alone. Coupling that with the poor information circulation ability of this era, and it was no wonder they mistook Aina for Joan.\nUnfortunately, this misunderstanding gave the enemy a morale boost Leonel hadn't accounted for.\n'I'm still too inexperienced…' Leonel's gaze narrowed.\n\"CHARGE! FOR OUR BROTHERS!\"\n'… However, as punishment for saying such words about Aina…' Leonel's grip tightened.\nBut then, it suddenly loosened. '… Just what am I thinking?'\nLeonel shook his head furiously. Back then, when those three bastards said those words, Leonel saw red. Before he even knew what was happening, they had died.\nAfterward, he tried to justify it to himself. They had alluded to all the women they had hurt before, they deserved it… right? It was fine if he punished them.\nBut that was just an excuse. What was that feeling he had had just now? That feeling that told him he had the right to execute people as he saw fit for little more than their words and ideals…\n'I'm losing my damn mind, what's wrong with me…'\nLeonel grit his teeth. A part of him had already decided. There was simply no place in this world for his soft heart. In a lot of ways, the words of those men that night had enlightened him to that fact.\nHowever, he refused to lose himself to the madness of this world. He felt that the end result of killing was just as important as the reason for it was. He wanted to be able to look himself in the mirror one day and justify his actions, to be able to feel that his heart could still remain as light as a feather.\nThe Englishmen weren't bad people. They were fighting for their country. They were fighting for their brothers.\nSome of them committed horrible deeds. They looted villages, raped women, took mothers from their children and children from their parents. But, it remained that this was only some of them.\nLeonel wasn't a God. He wasn't judge, jury and executioner, nor could his fragile mind state withstand such a burden.\nHowever, what he could do was work within the confines of his own limits. As long as he didn't overreach… as long as he maintained his respect for his opponents… he could slowly climb over this hurdle.\nLeonel took a deep breath as the horses and men charged, kicking up dust clouds.\n'Today, I'll kill you not for the words you've said, but because you are the general of my enemy.'\nLeonel closed his eyes, feeling every detail of the battlefield perfectly projected into his mind.\nHe lifted his spear above his shoulder, setting his feet.\n'50 meters… 40… 30… 20…'\nLeonel's eyes flashed open when the general was just a few strides of his horse from the first line of spikes. His timing was perfect.\nA low grunt escaped his lips, an unimpeded strength gushing through his body and leaving from his fingertip.\nThe spear shot across the skies. The force was so strong that any unbalanced weight remained unable to exert its presence, leaving it flying perfectly straight and through the slit in the helmet of the enemy general.\nEven as the first blood was reaped, the calvary smashed into the first line of spikes, the screams of horses having the chests pierced and legs broken rang through the battlefield.\nEnglish calvary men flipped through the air, completely astonished. But, before they could have a chance to regain their bearings, their fellow charging warriors bore down on them from behind, turning the front line into a complete mess not even 50 meters from the Frenchmen's own.\nUnfortunately for the English, their start only got worse. Because, appearing like a deathly ghost, Aina crossed the 50 meter distance between them in a flash, brandishing her ax toward those very same unorganized Englishmen.\nWithout a leader, they fell into a bloody mess.",

      "content": "Aina's agility couldn't be matched by these normal soldiers. A single sweep of her ax took five lives at a minimum, sometimes as much as ten.\nWith Leonel's support to her back, she entered the fray without hesitation. She was maybe a little too reckless. Leonel could only watch on with a cold sweat matting his back, throwing out as many spears as he could as quickly as he could.\nReaching over toward his barrel, Leonel realized that he had run out. He could only sprint back down and grab another, carrying it up with him.\n'This isn't good. The plan is working almost too well…'\nLeonel threw out another spear, reaping yet another life.\nA striking problem was becoming obvious to him. The Englishmen's first line had been disrupted so thoroughly that even the most forward of them hadn't crossed the third line of defense yet.\nBecause of that, Aina, who had already been their target from the beginning, wasn't receiving the support of the Frenchmen who stood in a daze as though they were watching the work of gods.\nBecause of the spikes, charging forward now would disrupt their advantage. It was best if they waited at the end of the last line of defense to begin their own slaughter. But since Leonel's trap and Aina's prowess was too overpowering, the enemy was nowhere near reaching that goal.\nThis might sound like a good thing, but Leonel's calculative mind saw that it most definitely wasn't. The way things were going now, Aina would be under too much pressure. He only had one arm to throw with, it was impossible for him to cover her perfectly. Though his high coordination gained him an ambidextrous ability, he needed his left arm to use his shield.\n'Dammit.'\n\"ARCHERS, TAKE DOWN THAT MAN!\"\nBy now, the Englishmen had noticed Leonel's impact on the battle. They could scarcely believe that a man could so accurately throw a spear, and such low quality ones at that. But, they could only accept what was before them.\nArchers, by their very nature, were located near the back of an army. As such, they were the least affected by the mess at their front line.\nUnfortunately for the Englishmen, trying to scream over the sounds of a battlefield as a normal human was impossible. Medieval armies usually relied on a combination of horn and flag sequences to give orders, but with their general gone, this was easier said than done.\nBy the time the second in command finally got hold of the situation and sent down the orders for the appropriate signal, their entire front line was unrecognizable. A ghastly scene of bisected bodies, pools of blood and organs, and men with tears in their eyes painted a terrible hell.\n\"Aina! Retreat!\"\nUnlike the Englishmen, Leonel's body was no longer normal. His voice carried a weight that theirs couldn't.\nBut, to Leonel's shock, Aina didn't listen.\nLeonel's lip twitched. She was always talking about his recklessness, but what was this?\n'Those long bowmen have an effective range of 200 meters at best. There's only about 150 meters between me and them, though. They can definitely hit me from here. Dammit, Aina…'\nLeonel dashed down the siege tower, grabbing another barrel of spears and hoisting it up.\nJust then a rain of arrows fell toward his direction, but he was already prepared.\nLeonel had noticed before that Aina's judgement was a bit off. The spear on his back was in fact of the D-grade. But, this small shield was a C-grade treasure with just one ability…\nLeonel raised the shield strapped to his left arm above his head. An instant later, its size increased tenfold, forming a massive umbrella in the skies.\nThe clink of the metallic arrows ricocheted off the shield, not leaving even the slightest dent. How could weapons of the 15th century damage a C-grade treasure?\nLeonel's mind turned rapidly. In that moment, with every clink of an arrow that rebounded from his shield, he drew a picture in his mind… Its trajectory, its speed, its acceleration…\nEvery arrow was projected into his mind, drawing a perfect line from its contact point to where the bowman who let it loose was.\nLeonel locked onto a target. Two fingers reached down toward his right, plucking a dart out of his metal container.\nHis shield still above his head, he flicked his fingers upward, causing the dart to spin for a brief moment to his side as he ripped his atlatl from his waist.\nIn perfect synchronization, the dart's spin was halted by the appearance of the atlatl, slotting into place as though finding its perfect home.\nLeonel's left arm swung to the side, swatting the last of the arrows away with his shield. In the same instant, his right arm whipped forward, using the swinging momentum of his left to its advantage to send a silver dart streaking through the air at over 200 kilometers an hour.\nThe targeted bowman never stood a chance. He was the best of his squad, Leonel could tell by the power behind his arrow. But on this day, he fell.\nThe pattern continued. Leonel alternated between protecting Aina's back with crude spears and taking out the bowman with his atlatl. He knew that he didn't have enough darts to take out all the bowman, but he didn't have a choice.\n'Come on… Retreat… Retreat already!' Leonel gritted his teeth.\nSuddenly, he felt the siege tower beneath him snap under another rain of arrows.\nLeonel leaped down before it could tilt to the side. He had already expected this to happen. There were only so many arrow volleys a structure they scrambled to build could take. But… This was why Leonel had had three built.\nLeonel streaked across the battlefield, making his way to the location of the next siege tower. Even as he used inhuman strength to lift it from its side, the Frenchmen and Englishmen finally clashed.\nHowever, Leonel found it hard to settle his heart. Aina had pretended not to hear him and she was even deeper into Englishmen territory now. Had it not been for them focusing their arrows on him, he didn't know if it would be possible to protect her.\nWith a final roar, Leonel stood the siege tower upright, pulling up one of the barrels he had left in this location up with him.\n'Dammit, what is she thinking?'\nThe good news was that even if the Englishmen wanted to ignore him from now on and target Aina, they would only be targeting their own men. The bad news was that this was only because Aina had traveled so deeply into their numbers that she was a small dot amidst a sea of infantry.\nLeonel frowned. 'Something's wrong…'",

      "content": "Aina was like a lone blazing star. Despite being alone and surrounded, there seemed to be a perpetual five meter radius around her that no one could keep their life within.\nFrom afar, it seemed like the Englishmen army had split into three. A single group of archers focusing their might toward Leonel, another attacking the Frenchmen, and the final entirely focused on this small woman with a weapon twice the size of her body.\nHowever, though Aina seemed invincible, Leonel could see her body heat increasing at an unhealthy pace.\n'Her stamina is running low…'\nLeonel's frown deepened. It had been less than 30 minutes since the battle began, but just how long could a normal human fight under such conditions? Even with her being far beyond a normal human, the load she was facing was severalfold greater as well.\n\"Aina! Retreat!\"\nLeonel shouted once more, putting everything he had into his voice. However, this time, the blaring horns of retreat sounded over him, covering his shouts completely.\n\"No! Not now!\"\nJust minutes ago, there was nothing Leonel could have wanted more. But now Aina had traveled too deeply into their territory.\nLeonel's arm cocked back and launched forward another crude spear.\nWith a sharp clang, it rebounded and shattered off of Aina's massive ax blade.\nAina's head finally snapped backward. But Leonel never got to register just what her expression was. All he could see was the fierce golden glow of her eyes, hiding a flickering redness that seemed to be the depths of a hellish flame.\nThere was only a single thing Leonel could grasp through the almost hundred meters that separated them. Her eyes were almost telling him to piss off.\nHe had seen them like this once before. That day she killed Conrad and stared him down as though she wanted him to witness every moment. He had been too stunned to register just what she was trying to convey to him back then… But now he was certain.\nShe wanted to be left alone.\nA fiendish red Force erupted from Aina's frail body as her killing speed increased explosively.\n[Aina Brazinger]\n[Strength: 1.50; Speed: 0.99; Agility: 0.99; Coordination: 1.00; Stamina: 0.10; Reactions: 1.00; Spirit: 0.10]\nLeonel's pupils constricted into pinholes. Leonel had never seen stats like this. Even the adjusted stats of the metal Invalid paled in comparison.\nBut, all his mind could focus on was her stamina. It hadn't gone up. In fact, it had plummeted the instant she began using this strength.\nAina's delicate roar overwhelmed the blaring horns of retreat.\nHer ax whipped around, a Force blade extending from its body. However, it didn't sweep outward. Instead, it attached to the blade of the ax, extending its range from almost three meters to over five!\nIt was like the ax was enveloped in the spirit of a larger battle ax, borrowing its power to reap lives. Just the first swing took 20 Englishmen from the world. The second swing took almost 25.\nThe Englishmen quaked in fear, but Leonel's anxiety only grew.\nOn the third swing, Aina faltered and the spirit that enveloped her ax flickered, leaving half the Englishmen destined to die with a new lease on life. It wasn't only this, but they suddenly felt more confident than they had before.\nBefore Aina stood a wall of Englishmen. To her back, the retreating Englishmen barred her in.\nLeonel didn't even register what he was doing before he found himself falling through the air, having jumped over the railing of his siege tower.\n'Something is wrong …'\nIn a flash, Leonel had already burst through the line of Frenchmen who had chosen not to chase. The Englishmen still had more than 16 000 of their original number. It was nothing short of foolish to pursue them with their now less than 1000 number.\nHowever, these weren't things Leonel had the mind to care about.\n\"Get out of my way!\"\n\"Kill her! Kill Joan of Arc!\"\nThe anxiousness in Leonel's heart grew. There was a wall of Englishmen before him, each completely set on Aina. They all but ignored him entirely. Aside from a few veterans who were tasked with holding the back line in a retreat, there was nothing.\nLeonel's jaw set. Without his high vantage point, he couldn't even see Aina in his line of sight anymore. He could only feel the direction of the Force she emitted.\nA part of Leonel wanted to hate these soldiers for standing before him, for blocking his way to Aina. But, with a will he didn't know he had, he pressed that hatred down.\nHe had promised himself not to kill in rage.\n'Breathe, Leonel…' He spoke to himself, slowly pulling the spear from his back.\nIt felt oddly familiar to him. The black steel that stood cool to his touch, the flat silver blade on its end… it all seemed to balance perfectly in his palm.\nThe body was almost two meters in length, the blade at just over two feet. It had proportions more like a glaive than a spear, but its glistening point made its true identity clear.\nThree flashes pierced forward, ending in holes in three English necks.\nOne arm held his shield, the other held his spear, dripping in blood.\nLeonel took a deep breath, his gaze flickering with a strong blue diamond-like light.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.80; Speed: 0.75 (+0.1); Agility: 0.99 (+0.1 - nullified); Coordination: 1.10; Stamina: 0.99 (+0.05 - nullified); Reactions: 1.10; Spirit: 0.40]",

      "content": "The feeling of Force coursing through your body was hard to describe. If Leonel were to try, it would be like landing on a bed of soft pillows, or walking through a mist of water on a hot summer's day. It didn't just feel good, it felt right. As though this was the true state of being.\nLeonel didn't know why his stamina had shot upward while Aina's tanked, but he didn't have the time to think about it. In fact, if he thought about it for even a little while, he would realize that because his coordination shot upward, he could more efficiently make use of his abilities, allowing him to use less strength to accomplish the same result.\nThough Leonel's strength and speed remained untouched, his combat prowess was on a completely different level. The movements of the Englishmen were almost painfully slow.\nHis spear snaked through the air like a viper, piercing throats and severing spines with every stroke. It was the most humane way Leonel could think to end their lives.\nSomething about wielding a spear felt different from his rod. Leonel had chosen the rod due to his lack of battle experience. He thought he'd have an easier time with a longer ranged weapon.\nHowever, with the spear, despite the fact it was obvious he had no real experience with it, he felt free. Something within his body was churning, waking from a sleep as though it had been waiting for this moment.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.85; Speed: 0.80 (+0.1); Agility: 0.99 (+0.1 - nullified); Coordination: 1.10; Stamina: 0.99 (+0.05 - nullified); Reactions: 1.10; Spirit: 0.40]\nMore of the hidden medicine within Leonel's body diffused, increasing his strength and speed by 0.05. He felt his blood boiling, but it wasn't fatigue. It was excitement.\nLeonel forgot his hatred of death, of killing. The awkward coordination in his arm stabilized. Like a child learning to walk, his spear became less reliant on his agility and more on his skill.\nHe seemed to be walking through the battle, traveling five meters forward with every step, a swath of bodies being left in his wake.\nThe Frenchmen felt numb. Was this the power God could bestow upon a man?\nLeonel's spear almost looked like a black whip, curling and curving around defenses and snapping back with supersonic speed.\nHe could feel her presence getting closer, but also fainter at the same time. Aina was already at the end of her rope. Leonel didn't know what had happened to her, but he knew he had to take her out of here.\n\"Aina!\" Leonel roared, cutting down another Englishmen.\nNo matter how good he felt, Leonel knew there was a limit to his strength. His stamina wasn't unlimited. Just walking forward these 50 meters through a swath of Englishmen had begun to tap into his 0.99 stamina.\nWhatever weird phenomena was happening to his blood ate into his stamina far quicker than he had been before. Leonel suspected that what he was experiencing now, Aina was experiencing tenfold.\n'Faster…'\nLeonel grit his teeth, pushing forward with an even faster speed. He began to rely on his ability heavily, reading through who had the weakest ability, cutting them down and using the gap their body formed to shoot past.\n\"Aina!\"\nLeonel could barely see her through the sea of bodies. Her breath hung so heavily on her lips that a dense fog formed whenever she exhaled. It wasn't nearly cold enough for air to condense like that, just what kind of heat was Aina experiencing.\nIn the past, hardly a speck of blood ever touched her. But now, she was completely drenched.\nLeonel could tell it wasn't her own blood. In fact, she seemed to be completely uninjured. But her present state still sent waves off in his heart.\n'Just what's wrong with her?'\n\"Kill her! For our fallen brothers!\"\n\"For our fallen brothers!\"\nThe gazes of the Englishmen almost glowed red beneath their helmets. They didn't see Aina as an arbiter of God. To them, she was a demon. A terrible devil descended to their lands. By this point, their resolve in taking down France raised several levels. It was their duty as God fearing men to expel these Devil Worshipers from their lands!\n\"For our brothers! For our families! For the Lord!\"\n\"For the Lord!\"\nThe Englishmen dug deep, throwing their lives away under Aina's ax only to allow those behind them to close an extra inch closer.\nLeonel couldn't find it within himself to hate them. Even if they bore down on the only woman that had ever stirred his heart, he realized now how right he was not to kill them in a rage. These were men who deserved his respect. Even in the face of power so much greater than their own, they put everything they had on the line.\nThis was the strength of the human race. A people who struggled to survive even in the most terrible situations. It was for this reason that the actions of Emperor Gervaise Fawkes were so reprehensible. Allowing the lives of billions to be snuffed out just to maintain control… Only these sort of people deserved his rage, his anger…\nFor the men before him now… They only deserved his regard.\nLeonel's mind calmed by another level.\nIn that moment, he realized that anger wasn't what fueled him. In fact, it impeded him.\nThe sincere respect Leonel felt brought him back. The challenge before him became no different from a football game or an exam, not because he found the lives of these men to be trivial, but because he had always taken even the simplest of tasks with the utmost seriousness. Taking on the burden of the lives of these men on his conscience was no different.\nA natural aura erupted from his body, coating the battlefield in a suffocating presence.\n'Come… I'll lay you to rest beneath a blade that recognizes your resolve…'",

      "content": "Leonel's spear became swifter. The clearer his mind became, the sharper his ability shone through. A calculative mind didn't need to rely on emotion.\nMaybe it was ironic that an inherently emotional man like Leonel had suddenly become the exact opposite. But it was an irony that Leonel wasn't thinking about.\n[Call of the Wind], a technique meant for throwing, subconsciously molded itself into his spear. His mind could see through how it worked, forming dozens of calculations a second, he changed its foundation, adding a power previously impossible to his strikes.\nIt was only now that Leonel finally made use of his powerful spirit. To now, he had only foolishly only used it to power his Internal Sight. Even when he activated his Force, he had focused it into his mind, vastly improving his coordination and reactions.\nBut now, a pale light coated his spear. It didn't extend his blade to near the extent Aina's ax spirit had, probably because it was being wielded through a crudely formed technique Leonel was still adjusting even to this very moment. But its power was undeniable.\nLeonel burst through the last line of Englishmen, his flexible armor and sweats matted in blood that wasn't his own.\n\"Aina!\"\nHaving burst through only one side of the encirclement, Aina still had enemies closing in from at least three sides.\nHowever, all Leonel received in return was a blazing ax.\nHe had never paid much attention to Aina's ax before. Maybe it was typical teenage boy selective sight. But, seeing it up close, it could only be described as a beautiful weapon.\nIt had a handle of over a meter and a half long, with a thickness so robust Aina's small hands couldn't wrap all the way around it.\nThe handle was a blazing red. Veins of gold and silver coursed through it, pulsing with a ruby light almost as though breathing.\nThe double headed blade was obscenely large, even a small bit longer in diameter from one blade to the other. The heads themselves glistened with a beautiful silver that was now covered in blood. But, their blade edges were an even deeper shade of red than the handle.\nLike he thought before. It was a beautiful weapon. But it was maybe less so when it was coming for his own head.\nLeonel knew Aina's strength was too much to take head on. Even with her stamina almost hitting zero, it was still over 1.00, far more than his own. In addition, he couldn't see through the grade of Aina's weapon at all, making him certain it would slice through his spear like it was rotting wood.\nWithout hesitation, Leonel ducked beneath it. Aina's agility matched his in this state, but it was clear that she was compromised. Her attack speed wasn't nearly as fast as it once was.\nThe moment the ax soared over his head, Leonel popped back up, using the flat of his spear's blade to slap the back of Aina's hand with some force.\nIt took more resolve to do this than he thought it would. The idea of harming her small frame made him sick. But he had no choice.\nLeonel wrapped around Aina's left side, even as her ax faltered in her hands. He expanded his shield to just over two meters in diameter, blocking the attacks to her back.\n\"… Le…\"\nAina seemed to finally sense Leonel's presence. A struggle lit in her eyes as though she was trying to decide whether or not to cut him down where he stood.\nThe truth was that she really could if she wanted to. His chest was completely opened to her after he wrapped around her left with his shield. She didn't need her ax at all. Just a palm to his chest would kill him with her level of strength.\n\"… I'm sorry…\"\nAina's gaze swayed with fatigue, her cheek falling to Leonel's chest.\nLeonel's eyes flickered. He could feel the searing heat of her body even through his flexible armor.\n\"Stop him!\"\n\"Don't let her get away!\"\nLeonel sighed. He strapped the massive shield to his back, pulling Aina in with his left arm to his chest. She herself was as light as a feather, but the ax she refused to let go of even while unconscious was a completely different story. It alone weighed over 200 pounds… And Leonel had vaguely felt Aina lowering its weight before she fainted.\nDespite the situation, Leonel inadvertently smiled and even felt a bit flustered.\n'What am I thinking?! She has a high fever and you're in the middle of an army that wants nothing more than to kill her. Get it together!'\nMaking a decision, Leonel didn't choose to run. His shield to his back, Aina in one arm, his spear in the other, he stood tall.\n\"If you'd like to come, you can come. I'll take as much as you can give. But I won't let her die here.\"\nRegaining his calm, Leonel's imposing aura shone forth once more. As dangerous as Aina had been, this was something she hadn't had.\nLeonel meant his words. Running away would do him no good and he would only end up implicating the Frenchmen. Even though the English had retreated, they still had more than 15 000 of their original number. If they rallied, they could still crush the less than thousand remaining Frenchmen.\nThere was only one option left. Leonel had to impose his will. He had to appear invincible. He had to crush their resolve until nothing was left, that very resolve he respected with all his heart.",

      "content": "Leonel lost his concept of time. The sun likely rose and set at least twice, maybe three times? He wasn't sure.\nHe didn't know where he pulled the strength from.\nThe truth was that kind of time didn't pass. Even if Leonel himself was surpassing the limits of a human, fighting for three days without rest was beyond him. Even when he stayed awake for that long in the Mayan temple, most of the time was spent sneaking around and avoiding large groups of Spaniards.\nStill, his illusion of the sun rising and setting wasn't completely off. By the time Leonel slowly dragged his beaten and ragged body out, his spear in one hand, Aina in the other, the high sun had set and the hints of dawn had begun to creep up.\nLeonel's spear and Aina's battle ax dragged along the ground, leaving deep marks in the dry land. He had no idea how Aina managed to hang onto that massive thing while cuddling up like a kitten, but the reality was right before him.\n\"… How'd I end up liking such a crazy woman…\"\nLeonel looked down at Aina who had her head buried in his chest. Her right arm was pinned against his body, but her left dragged the ax at an awkward angle. Leonel was worried that her frail arm would snap, but she struggled too strongly every time he tried to adjust her.\nOn the bright side, Aina's temperature had steadily decreased. At least she wasn't scolding to the touch anymore.\nLeonel looked up to find General Franck standing before him with a look of fear in his eyes. It seemed he hadn't dared to retreat without Leonel's input.\n\"… They won't be attacking again…\" Leonel started in a voice so raspy he hardly recognized it as his own. \"… We can head to Orleans in 48 hours. I need to rest. Don't disturb me.\"\nThe general nodded profusely and even led Leonel to his personal tent.\n\"… Oh.\" Leonel paused before entering the tent. \"Send two or three of your comfort women here.\"\nThe general was speechless for a moment but didn't dare voice the questions in his mind. In fact, he even led two of his favorites over and sent them into the tent without the slightest reservations.\nWhen the two French women entered, they carried slight blushes on their faces. Compared to the less desired comfort women, these two seemed to have just stepped out of a salon. Their clothes were simple and cheap, but clean. In addition, their beauty was enticing. It was obvious that they could pass for noble women had their birth not been so unfortunately low.\nWhen they saw the rippling definition in Leonel's bare back, their blush deepened. They seemed not to notice the dirt, grime and blood that covered him. They were used to dealing with the poor hygiene of soldiers. Compared to them, Leonel was an angel.\n\"Oh, you're here.\" Leonel turned back and nodded. \"Please help her clean up and lay her to rest. I'll wait outside.\"\nAfter saying these words, Leonel ignored the confused gazes of the two women and walked out of the tent.\n\"… Just think about it. Have you ever heard a man of God asking for a whore so openly? Maybe they really are the devil just like the Eng —\"\nThe words froze when Leonel walked out bare chested. They shivered in fear, thinking that they'd be punished. But Leonel simply stood there, his arms crossed and his breathing even. He felt like he could collapse at any moment, but he stood tall.\nRight now, he felt better than he had in a long time. Maybe better than he had in his entire life.\nIt was an odd feeling. He didn't like killing. And today, he had killed more people than he had even in the Mayan Temple. But, his heart was as light as a feather.\nThere were many complicated questions of morality before him. Whether he deserved to be on a battlefield of mortals even when he was effectively a god amongst them, whether his reasons for killing them were better than their reasons for wanting to kill him, even whether Aina's singular life was worth as much as all of theirs…\nHowever, maybe due to his youth, Leonel had a very youthful answer to it all.\nFinding the answer to all of these questions was impossible. Too many things were relative, too many outcomes were ultimately unknown. As long as he could protect his own code, maintain his own conscience… He was okay with that.\nIf there came a day where someone wanted revenge for his actions, he would welcome it.\nAfter an unknown period of time, the two women came out of the tent.\n\"The young mistress has been cleaned and is now resting, young noble. You can enter now.\"\n\"We've also set a tub of water to warm under a fire for you, young noble. We hope our services have pleased you.\"\n\"… You are very lucky, young noble.\" The women said with a light giggle.\nLeonel expressed his thanks, not knowing what the two of them meant by that, as the two comfort women bowed.\nAfter Leonel entered, the two women were swarmed. When they heard the purpose for which the two women were called, their faces could only burn with embarrassment. They were certain Leonel had heard them, yet he couldn't be bothered to deal with them.\nThat said, the Leonel they so very feared was flustered beyond belief at the moment.\nThe two women had indeed done what Leonel asked. In fact, they went above and beyond, even wrapping some of Aina's injuries. Near the end of her battle, she hadn't managed to remain completely unscathed.\nThe issue was that they had applied the bandages and did nothing to put Aina's clothes back on. Luckily Aina's lower half was covered by a bear skin blanket, but her upper half was nothing but bandages. Without her normal covering, her chest was far more prominent.\nAina's assets weren't exactly outrageously large, but Leonel was certain that his hand, even with its own size, had no ability to grasp… it fully.\nThe important bits were still covered, but it was still far too stimulating for a young man who had never seen such things before. Pornography was too regulated, and Leonel had never even been to a beach before considering how rare those things were in this age, where would he have ever seen such things? He had always rejected James when he tried to goad him into going to see the girls' swim team, worried Aina would be disgusted by his actions.\nLeonel quickly covered his eyes. \"I didn't see anything… I didn't see anything…\"\nLeonel rushed to Aina's side, fumbling around a bit and finally pulling the blanket up to cover her completely. Only then did he sigh a breath of relief, missing the slight curve in Aina's lip.\nAfter Leonel settled his beating heart and shifted the uncomfortable stiffness in his pants, he found the large bucket of water the two comfort women had rested over a fire. Feeling that it was hot enough, he used the last of his strength to lug it over to the general's wooden tub and dumped it in.\nHe had only barely gotten in and begun scrubbing himself when his fatigue hit him like a speeding vehicle. Even he wasn't sure when, but his consciousness slipped into a deep darkness.",

      "content": "Aina woke up long before Leonel did.\nSeeing her present state, she frowned deeply, a whirl of complex emotions spinning in her mind.\nShe blushed when she realized how scantily clad she was. Had Leonel seen her like this?\nNo… She faintly felt the presence of two women before, moving her around and cleaning her… It seems he was too honest, just like he always was…\nAina winced slightly as she stood.\nHer figure was the pinnacle of perfection. The bandages were too weak to perfectly support her ample bosom, so they rippled slightly under her movement, causing a nose bleed worthy scene. Her lower half was hardly covered at all. If it wasn't for the blanket she still held onto, a heavenly sight would be there for absolutely no one to behold.\nAina touched her face, sighing in relief when she saw that her coverings were still there. It wasn't strictly necessary for her to keep using them, but there was a blockage in her heart that stopped her. Maybe somewhere deep inside, she felt that if Leonel never saw her true face, she would hurt him less.\nBut what had happened today…? She had ended up hurting him anyway…\nAina finally registered Leonel's light snoring. She turned around to find him passed out in a wooden tub, much of his skin pruning by now.\nShe inadvertently giggled. There was something about him now that seemed so innocent. She never quite understood how a man who radiated such imposing aura over something as small as a pop quiz or a football game, could simultaneously be so green and pure.\nAina gingerly put on her clothes. It seemed the two women had also done her the service of cleaning them as well. She even found her undergarments taken care of.\nHiding away her gorgeous curves, she walked to the side of Leonel in the tub. A deep red shade covered her cheeks down to her neck. She couldn't quite see Leonel's lower half since the dirt and grime that had covered his body had melded into the water, but the idea that he was naked made her heart beat wildly. It wasn't excitement, but a sheer nervousness at the unknown.\nAina grit her teeth, hooking her shoulder under Leonel's armpit and lifting him.\nHe didn't even react to her actions, not even the slightest flinch. One could only imagine how tired he must have been to allow such a thing to happen to him in a Zone.\nAina's gaze colored with guilt, biting down on her lower lip.\nEventually, she steadied her heart.\nFirst, she set Leonel down averting her gaze. Then, she poured out the dirty liquid, rushing away to find a few barrels worth of clean water. Though her body was in tatters, she ignored the soreness entirely. For a person with her strength, she didn't even need 10% of her power to do things like lifting up Leonel and bringing in these barrels.\nFinally, she got down to doing exactly what she dreaded. Taking a deep breath, she began to clean Leonel, the bite on her lip increasing in pressure the more wounds she exposed beneath the thick patches of dirt and mud.\nBy the time Leonel's body was mostly clean, her guilt was overwhelmed by cheeks so red steam practically came off of them. She felt that maybe she should have asked the comfort women to come by again to help, but she had conveniently forgotten this possibility.\nIt was suffice to say that she had never seen a man like this, nor had she ever touched one.\nRemembering how long she must have spent sleeping in Leonel's arms, the burning of Aina's cheeks only grew.\nBut that was right… He had suffered so much, if she couldn't pay him back even this small bit, she couldn't live with herself. But why did his body have to be so toned and hard? Her fingers were trembling with every gentle wipe.\nFinally, there was only one part of Leonel's body left. Aina was truly tempted to leave it as is, he would handle it himself when he woke up, but when she thought of the era they were in, she hesitated.\nWhat if it got infected? She knew that that area was a man's pride even if she had never seen one before. She had been around enough high school boys to know that it was all they ever talked about aside from the women they had been with.\nLeonel was different from them… But that didn't mean he didn't inwardly place importance on it.\nAina may have never seen one, but she had had a robust education. She knew the kind of impact an infection on such a sensitive area could have, especially in the medieval ages.\nThe pressure of her teeth on her lips grew again.\nAina slowly took the towel she had used to cover Leonel's area off, barely holding back her girlish squeal when her eyes lay on it. If the Englishmen she had struck fear in saw her now, who knew how they would react?\nAina's breathing turned ragged and choppy. She began to slowly clean the grime away from the edges, pulling her courage together to inch closer.\n'… Those are… very sensitive… I should use a lighter touch…' Aina tried to remember what she had learned in all those Class A biology classes. Her Five-Star Profession was actually related to the medical field, so it wasn't very difficult for her.\nAina whimpered slightly when her towel touched those two sensitive things, using her opposite hand to lift up the limp member that covered them slightly. But she was already inwardly panicking even more. Because of her soft touches around such a sensitive area, she had already noticed it growing stiffer. By this point, she didn't even need to actively move it out of the way.\n'… Just ignore it… Just ignore it… It's a natural reaction… It just means he's healthy… It'll go down on its own…'\nAina clamped her legs shut tightly, the bite to her lower lips finally beginning to draw blood.\nAina rejoiced inwardly when she felt that she had cleaned Leonel's family jewels adequately enough. There was just one task left.\nShe cleaned her towel with a new bucket of water and started toward the towering member that filled her with a bit of dread. It pulsed as though it had an eye of its own, piercing into her soul.\n'… Maybe a little bit too healthy…'\nAina knew what average was, such a thing was part of her studies. And she knew that this most definitely was not average.\nGathering up the last bits of her courage that remained, Aina used the damp towel on it, wiping away the dried sweat and dirt that had somehow made its way down there.\n'… The top is the most sensitive part, I should be careful again…' She thought to herself.\nFinally, she got to the top, dabbing away gently and making sure nothing that could infest Leonel got into places it shouldn't.\nJust as she felt she was finished and could finally step away, Leonel had a sudden sharp intake of breath.\nAina panicked, thinking that he might wake up. Her neck spun toward his face with such speed that she almost suffered a case of whiplash.\nLuckily, it seemed that he was still asleep, completely oblivious to what was happening.\nAina sighed a breath of relief, turning back to her task in time to see a gusher of thick white liquid launching itself into the air with astonishing force. She only had time to block with both her palms before it could land on her face.\nCompletely stunned, Aina felt the liquid slowly drip down her hands. She could even faintly see the satisfied relief on Leonel's sleeping face between her fingers.",

      "content": "Aina rolled her lips over themselves. In a motion that was far slower than she cared to admit, she washed her hands clean, wiped away the portions that fell on Leonel, and covered his body in a blanket.\nEven hours after she finished, her heart still beat wildly.\nDays later, Leonel startled awake, finding himself in a rocking vehicle. It took him a moment to realize that he was lying on a bed made of straw and that the 'vehicle' was a horse pulled carriage.\nLeonel shot up, taking quick and deep breaths.\nHow could he let this happen? Not only had he gone to sleep, but he was completely out of it. He was in a Zone, he wasn't at home.\nIt took several moments before Leonel realized that Aina was sitting on a cushioned bench opposite his, averting her eyes.\nLeonel looked down at himself and blinked in confusion. He could tell that he was naked now, but at the very least, his lower half was covered. There was no real reason for her to avert her gaze like that. But, he didn't question it too much.\n\"Are you alright?\" Leonel asked.\nAina finally turned to face Leonel, seemingly stunned by his question.\n\"… I should be asking you that.\" She said softly.\n\"Me? I'm fine.\" Leonel smiled, rotating his arm as though to prove a point.\nHe really did feel great.\n\"I'm sorry for passing out like that.\" Leonel said apologetically. \"I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if something happened while I was out of it.\"\nAina opened her mouth to answer, but she felt that if she tried to speak now, she wouldn't be able to control her tears. So, she said nothing.\nShe knew that Leonel couldn't control what happened. Not only had he spent himself dry for her sake, but he had awoken a Lineage Factor he wasn't even aware of. Usually such awakenings happened in a controlled space under the protection of your family. It happening in such a dangerous place was about as disastrous a outcome as you could have.\nHowever, Aina also knew something else. The longer you could withstand the awakening of your Lineage Factor, the greater potential it would have in the future. If her vague thoughts while she was unconscious were correct, Leonel had stayed awake for more than half a day. She had never heard of anyone lasting more than a couple hours at best.\nOn top of that, Leonel wasn't meditating and gritting his teeth like those people had been. He had been fighting a battle against thousands of enemies. It wasn't an exaggeration to say his degree of difficulty was far higher and worth far more.\nThe how long one stayed awake metric wasn't exact. It was just a vague metric of how much the Lineage Factor managed to be stimulated. Therefore, if Leonel was battling while his was activated, it went to reason that every second of his remaining awake was worth far more than normal.\nAina couldn't even fathom what that meant. The only one she knew of who could match him was her… But the difference between them was that when her Lineage Factor activated, she lost control of her mind. So while her performance was just as impressive, it wasn't something she was proud of…\nShe had almost killed her father that day.\n\"… Please stop apologizing to me…\" Aina finally managed to say.\nLeonel smiled. \"It's not your fault.\"\n\"I…\"\n\"Do you have my pants?\" Leonel cut her off.\nAina stared blankly for a moment before nodding. She had even managed to patch together the tears in it a bit.\n\"… They're a bit small for you now, though.\" She said softly. \"I think you've gotten taller.\"\nLeonel's smile widened. \"So you pay enough attention to me to notice?\"\nAina blushed and turned away, throwing his pants over.\nLeonel managed to slip his pants on before standing up and stretching. He was certain that this carriage was only built recently. He likely had the siege engineers to thank.\n\"You still haven't answered my question.\" Leonel turned back toward Aina. \"Are you alright?\"\n\"…\" Aina sighed. \"Put a shirt on first and I might consider answering.\"\nSeeing that a bit of Aina's cheekiness was back, Leonel's heart felt lighter. He happily obliged and put on his flexible armor before covering it in an off-white linen shirt he wasn't sure of the origin of.\n\"Happy?\"\nAina turned away. If one focused on his upper half and not his sorry excuse for pants, Leonel actually looked quite good. Luckily he hadn't thought about why he had been unconscious for so long, yet still managed to stay clean.\n\"… My Lineage Factor has a negative effect on my psychological state. I lose control of it from time to time, but especially when I'm on the verge of a breakthrough. Only when I stabilize into my new realm will I be able to rein it in again.\"\n\"I already guessed as much.\" Leonel waved a hand. \"Like I said already, it's not your fault. I only want to know if there are any lasting impacts to your health.\"\n\"No… Aside from fatigue, there are no other side effects.\"\n\"That's good. Then don't recklessly act when you're on the verge of a breakthrough again. You should have stayed by my side like I asked.\" Leonel said sternly.\n\"But you…\"\n\"Hm?\" Leonel tried to probe out the rest of her words, but Aina seemed to not want to speak anymore.\n'But you…?' Leonel frowned. Suddenly, he froze as though he was hit by a lightning bolt.\nHe realized he had made a mistake. He and Aina were partners, but he had unilaterally decided to help the Frenchmen. Could it be that Aina took the risk despite knowing the possible outcome because of his decision?",

Sorry for all the changes, my hands decided to crap out on me after too much writing, lmao. But I'm feeling good with this new keyboard now, so we can get back to grinding.]\nLeonel's gaze locked onto Aina as though trying to read something through her expression. But, try as he might, he couldn't get anything out of her. She had returned to being that completely unreadable existence.\n\"You should focus on understanding your Lineage Factor, we still have some time before we reach Orleans.\"\nLeonel continued to stare at Aina for an uncomfortably long time, as though he hadn't heard her words at all.\nHe found it too difficult to read her. Was she shy? Or was she the same woman who didn't hesitate to tell him that he smelled or demand he put on a shirt? Was she murderous? Or was she the same woman who stayed back to protect the Frenchmen by his side?\nJust who was she?\n\"… Lineage Factor?\" Finally, after Aina began squirming beneath his gaze with nowhere to escape to, he registered the words she had spoken.\n\"You aren't aware? You awoke a Lineage Factor on the battlefield. It's why you couldn't control your unconscious state.\"\nLeonel frowned. \"… You mentioned Lineage Factors once before when you spoke of Natural Force Nodes. What are they exactly?\"\nAina wasn't surprised by this question. Judging by Leonel's previous ignorance, whoever of his family was of a higher world most definitely hadn't explained everything to him just yet.\n\"Just like how Zones are points in time higher dimensions connected with lower ones, Lineage Factors are the genetic equivalent of these instances.\n\"Have you ever thought of the proper way to interpret higher Dimensions? What exactly does the Fourth Dimension mean?\"\n\"Well, in an abstract sense, a higher order Dimension is just any plane of existence infinitely more powerful than the last, in the simplest terms. I can write a story and exert infinite control over the 2D. Likewise, a 2D construct can obliterate someone in the first Dimension.\"\nAina nodded. \"In the real world, outside of the abstract, higher Dimensions work similarly, though not exactly in this way. The higher a person's Dimensional Constitution, the more influence they can exert. It's this power that causes anomalies that must be dealt with in Zones, and it's also this power that allows certain abilities to be passed down through generations.\n\"Simply put, a Lineage Factor is the result of a family member of yours, whether in the past or in the future, who has exerted sufficient influence to grant you this ability.\"\n\"… Or in the future?\" Leonel finally heard something that shocked him.\n\"Yes. Just like Zones. Sub-Dimensional Zones are examples of the future influencing the past. If they weren't, why would they only start appearing now and not before the Metamorphosis began?\n\"Just like you said yourself, you can think of it as higher Dimensions being infinitely powerful compared to lower ones. If you wrote a book in 2D, is your concept of time like that of your characters? You could make a million years pass in the blink of an eye if you wanted, or you could have a flashback send them a trillion years into the past.\"\nLeonel's gaze glowed with enlightenment.\n'… Do I really have a family member from a higher world? Or is it that someone down my line awakened a similar ability and passed it back to me?'\nLeonel's mind spun. 'Wait! If that's possible, then it's not necessarily true that Aina or one of her parents is from another world. If this future influencing the past result is possible and even probable, then it's likely that the most powerful families of Earth will have begun awakening these Lineage Factors.\n'Logically, the more powerful the family on Earth, the higher chance they have for success in the future, and the more likely they are to create powerful characters who can pass these abilities backward.\n'But I've never heard of Aina's Brazinger family. There's also not a single Brazinger on the Eligible Bachelor list. So is it that her family really came from another world? Or… Is it that the truly powerful families of Earth have hidden themselves waiting for this chance?'\nThere were too many unknowns. Even with his ability, Leonel had no ability to guess at what the truth was or even begin to find the right path.\n\"Aina… your family —.\"\nLeonel stopped his words. He hadn't even begun to form his thoughts when Aina's gaze flashed with an endless fury. For a moment, he sensed that she almost lost control over her Lineage Factor once more and went berserk.\nThis time, with her being at peak health, Leonel wasn't confident in his ability to stop her. If she really lost it again, it could be disastrous.\nAfter several minutes of Leonel's silence and her deep breaths, Aina's jaw set.\nSeeing that she was okay, Leonel didn't question her further and simply went to sit on the bed of straw, pulling out [Call of the Wind]. He had never gotten around to reading it like he had [Dimensional Cleanse]. So, it was about time he did.\nThe hours ticked by silently and Leonel truly expected Aina to not speak on the topic again. But, unexpectedly, on the next day, she did.\n\"I'm sorry…\" She said softly. \"… It's not that you said anything wrong, you hadn't even asked a question yet…\"\nShe felt guilty. It seemed that all of her interactions with Leonel always ended in him being extremely understanding and her demanding too much of him. It only made her more certain in some decisions she had made.\n\"… The short of it is that I don't have a family. I had a mother, and my father… is no longer with me. But, even while I was in my mother's womb, we were expelled from the Brazinger Clan.\n\"The only reason I still carry their name is so that I can reject it myself when they most wish for me to keep it.\"\nAina's words were very gentle, but they held a resolve far larger than her small body.",

He somehow felt that was exactly what he shouldn't do in this situation.\nInstead, after his nod, he turned back to his little booklet, allowing the sound of the carriage wheels pulling through dirt and gravel to fill the air again.\n'Call of the Wind.

And, Gravity is tied to gravitons.\n'The manipulation of these particles is where the cultivation of Force comes from if it were to be described in the simplest terms possible.'\nLeonel re-read this introduction for the dozenth time, as though trying to find something he had missed before.\nAs far as he knew, gravitons were the last of the particles to be found and hadn't been until extremely recently. Not even a decade before his birth, if he recalled correctly…\n'The use of these four particles, their subspecies, and their unique combinations, are responsible for every sort of Force that Force Wielders use.\n'The higher the Dimension, the more complex these particles become, the more variations of them exist, and the more difficult they become to control. But, there is one thing that must always be remembered:\n'The Art of Force Wielding is a calculated science. Should you take it as a game for fun or entertainment to screw around, you will die.'\nLeonel took this warning very seriously. His actions on the battlefield that day had been extremely dangerous. Recklessly manipulating a Force technique like that was practically asking for death.\nTo top this off, he had even been using the technique without even opening the book. Had he not had the talent, and had [Call of the Wind] not been manipulating some of the weakest Force particles, he most definitely would have caused irreparable harm to himself.\nSettling his heart, Leonel organized his thoughts once more.\nThe first and most important thing he learned was that 'Spirit' and 'Force' were not the same thing. He had already vaguely grasped this when he noticed that activating his Force pushed his spirit up by 0.1. But now, he was absolutely certain.\nSpirit was related to the senses, the so-called Inner Sight. The higher one's spirit, the easier it was to control and manipulate Force. But, high spirit didn't necessarily mean that you had a lot of Force to wield.\nThe reason Leonel's spirit had ticked up wasn't because Force could give you more spirit. The true reason was because of the location of his Force Node. Because it was in his brain, its activation supplied more strength to his mind, thus increasing his spirit.\nAs a result…\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.92; Speed: 0.85 (+0.1); Agility: 0.95 (+0.1); Coordination: 1.01; Stamina: 0.90 (+0.05); Reactions: 1.01; Spirit: 0.30; Force: 0.20]\nFor now, Leonel adjusted his Force stat to 1.00. He didn't have anyone but Aina to measure himself up against. So, he simply arbitrarily picked the number that made the most sense to him. This way, he should reach 1.00 when he lit his ninth Force Node.\nAs for his other stats, they were like this when he woke up. He didn't know if it was because of his Lineage Factor, or if it was because of his dad's concoction, but either way, their increasing was good news for him.\nThis aside, the second thing Leonel learned was that the Force Nodal energy in his brain stem and the Forces [Call of the Wind] spoke of weren't exactly the same either.\nThe energy Leonel absorbed through [Dimensional Cleanse] was an amalgamation of all Forces. If Leonel had to attach a name to it, he would call it Potential Energy. It was unused Force that had the potential to effect change.\nHowever, the Force [Call of the Wind] spoke of could be called Kinetic Energy. It was energy that was actively releasing its potential in order to create the change its controller desired.\nTechniques like [Call of the Wind] were the catalyst needed to turn Potential Force into Kinetic Force.\nThe third thing that Leonel learned was that there was a second way to accomplish this very task. When he 'activated' the Force in his Nodes, resulting in his stats going up, what he was essentially doing was metabolizing the Force in his body to increase his strength. This was a natural ability all those with Force Nodes had. Though, those with a certain level of talent had greater efficiency than others in this conversion.\nComing to this point, one can then understand why Leonel's actions had been so dangerous… He was essentially converting Potential Force into Kinetic Force using an unverified method. That was like building a nuclear power plant without the proper safety measures. And… building that power plant in your brain stem…\nIf that wasn't an act of suicide, Leonel didn't know what was.\nIt took Leonel quite a while to stop his cold sweat so that he could focus his everything on how [Call of the Wind] actually worked.\n'Break it down into a science…'\nLeonel knew that as he evolved toward higher Dimensions, he would have to relearn the fundamental knowledge he had in some cases. However, when it came to Black level techniques that still resided within the Third to Fourth Dimensions, the knowledge he did have was robust enough.\n'… Wind resistance is a matter of friction. If framed like this, I can think of multiple ways a technique that mitigates it can work… You could use Force to make a projectile more aerodynamic… you could use Force to loose the strong and weak Forces between atoms to reduce their drag… you could use Force to create a vacuum in the line of trajectory…'\nLeonel listed ideas for what must have been hours, he even became completely lost in his thoughts, forgetting that he had a technique that would give him a method right before him. Plus, many of the ideas he thought of were well beyond his reach with his current proficiency and amount of Force.\n[Call of the Wind] actually managed to function differently than all the several dozen ideas Leonel thought of, and also gave him a glimpse of what was considered complex and simple in the world of Force Science.\n'… Using Electromagnetic Force to magnetize air particles… forming those particles into a point… Almost like the heavy steel tip of a javelin, except this spear tip is far more complex…'\nThere were a few principles at work. One was aerodynamics, the other was drag reduction, and the last was magnetism. However, despite all of this, there was a beautiful simplicity to it all because it all worked on one mechanism.\n'In the future, I have to not only think of ideas that work, but also ideas that use the path of least resistance…'\nThe more he studied [Call of the Wind], the more beautiful he felt it was and the more apropos he realized the name really was.\nOn the third day, Leonel stood, opening the door of the rumbling carriage.\nAina looked up to see him holding his spear at the moving doorway, but said nothing to disturb.\nLeonel stood at the doorway blankly for a moment. Around him, there were escorts of knights and warriors all around. But, his eyes were entirely focused on the border of forest beyond them. It was just about ten meters away.\nAs fast as lightning, Leonel's static stance shifted. He lowered his hips, brandished his spear, and pierced forward toward empty air.\nThe Frenchmen who could see what was happening opened their eyes wide, shocked by Leonel's actions. But in the next moment, something even more shocking occurred.\nAt the edge of the forest, a thick ancient tree suddenly had its trunk cleanly pierced through. It was done so sharply that it sounded no different from the dull thump of an arrow embedding into wood.",

Next chapter at 200]\nAina blinked several times, almost feeling the need to wipe her eyes clean in case some dirt made her see things.\n'… Ten meters is about the limit I guess. And I feel I only have enough Potential Force to do that three time at such a distance. If I keep it to within a foot or two of my spear's blade, though, several hundred times wouldn't be a problem…'\nAfter understanding the concept behind [Call of the Wind], Leonel only needed to make a very minor adjustment to make it applicable to his spearmanship.\nThe first step was to form an alignment of charged particles. These particles then pull on other air particles such that they form an incredibly sharp projectile of air. Following this, using the same concept as a rail gun, the magnetized particles pull along the projectile, all the while adding more and more substance to this sharply shaped air. Since these particles were being used to pull the projectile along, they obviously would be able to cause less drag, and thus the problem of friction was also partially solved.\nIn the case of a throwing motion, this pulling would help an arrow or dart travel further, while the sharp shape would mitigate its slowing even more. However, in the case of Leonel's spear, he could apply the same concept without releasing his weapon, making his strikes faster and sharper. On top of this, he could extend the range of the sharpened wind to ten meters!\n'… But I felt that feeling again, when I held my spear… That burning sensation in my blood…'\nLeonel closed the door of the carriage without a word to the Frenchmen. He wasn't too eager in their adulation, he was only a bit too eager to test himself.\n\"… Do you know what my Lineage Factor is?\" Leonel asked Aina.\nThese were the first words they had exchanged in over a day, yet he didn't seem to carry any bit of awkwardness.\nAina looked at him helplessly. \"How could I possibly know that?\"\nSeeing the disappointment in his face, Aina quickly continued.\n\"Just tell me what you feel.\"\n\"I feel my blood boiling. But it only happens when I pick up a spear. Is that even possible, how would that work?\"\nAina blinked in confusion as well. A Lineage Factor related to a weapon? She had never heard of one.\nHer Lineage Factor massively upped her strength and Force output. Much like hers, other Lineage Factors worked similarly, amplifying physical traits. They were always related to things like speed, stamina, reaction time. There were some rare ones that amplified Force like hers, but they were extraordinarily infrequent.\nShe couldn't even begin to wrap her head around how someone would pass down the expertise of a weapon in their genes. It seemed almost nonsensical.\nHer thoughts were the same as Leonel's. With his little understanding of the world of Force and Lineages related to it, a Lineage Factor like his didn't make much sense. He could think of methods to use the four fundamental Forces to improve just about any physical trait, though he wasn't able to execute these ideas. But, how would you even begin to construct the expertise of a weapon using them?\n\"Noble arbiters, we are here. The blessed one has heard of your exploits and has come out to greet you personally.\"\nLeonel was snapped out of his thought by the loud voice of General Franck.\nSending a gaze toward Aina, they both stood to step out of the carriage to be greeted by a grandiose estate. No, it could only be considered a castle.\nChateau Royal de Blois. Who knew how many kings and royals had called this place home? It was this very place Joan came to be blessed by the Archbishop of Reims before she then proceeded to drive the English from Orleans.\nLeonel noticed that Franck's army had disappeared. In fact, the coachmen who drove their carriage had actually switched to the general himself.\nBefore them, there was a small squadron of knights, numbering no more than ten. They each rode silver armored horses of their own, standing with the castle that stretched hundreds of meters in each direction as their backdrop.\nHowever, it was impossible to have eyes for these men because before them sat a woman of legend herself.\nSitting upon a white steed armored in gold, Joan held her helm in one hand and a large pole flag her other.\nLeonel was certain that history painted her as a woman of above average looks with the worn skin of a peasant and a birthmark beneath her ear. She was meant to be a stocky woman of barely 5'2\", having a body tempered by the life of a plebeian as well.\nThese were all the things Leonel had heard. Often times, only the women in fantasies both had the visage of a goddess and the mind of a renaissance genius. Joan of Arc… Cleopatra… Helen of Troy… These women were never what some mythologies painted them out to be.\nYet, Leonel was finding out personally that maybe that was all bullshit. The history books didn't say anything about Joan riding a white horse with gold armor either, but here she was before him. Not only that, but she was maybe the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life.\nFlowing black hair, gentle blue eyes, delicate tanned skin and a smile that stole the hearts of men. Her shapely armor wrapped around her curves, but carried a holy modesty to them that was directly contradictory.\nIf there ever were to be a goddess who descended to Earth, Leonel was certain that it would have to be her.",

      "content": "Joan smiled down at them from atop her horse. Since she wasn't using her own strength to move, it made it difficult for Leonel to get a reading on her stats. He almost felt that there was something in her smile that said she was doing it on purpose.\nOn the other hand, Leonel felt that he was reading into it too much. The moment he saw Joan, other than being stricken by her beauty, he instantly remembered the fact that he was meant to kill this woman eventually.\nLeonel sighed inwardly. Maybe it was easier to paint her out as some evil mastermind now so he could more easily do what needed to be done in the future.\nQuite frankly, Leonel was unsure how the 'Boss' of a Zone was decided. Were they always bad people? He wasn't certain of that. He only had one sample to pull his conclusion from.\nHowever, if he purely used the reason why they entered Zones to draw his conclusion — to deal with instances of higher Dimensions touching their timeline before they should — then the logical answer was no. They weren't always bad people…\nIt was very possible that Joan's only crime was being ahead of her time, awakening abilities before she should have… In such a case, Leonel found he had taken a leap head first into yet another dilemma.\n\"Forgive me for not stepping down from my horse to greet you personally. I took an arrow to the thigh in my previous battle and am unable to walk under my own power currently.\"\nHearing these words, Leonel felt even worse about his previous thoughts. History did speak about Joan being injured on multiple occasions. The fact she came out to greet them and even swung up to sit on her horse in such a state made her more than worthy of praise.\nIt only made it more difficult now that he remembered that in this year, she was actually his age… She had recaptured Orleans at just 17 years old. By now, she was like 18.\n\"We take no offense, Lady Joan. Please excuse my companion, she cannot speak. We've humbly come to be your aid.\"\n\"Cannot speak French? And please do not call me a Lady, I am no noble.\" Joan giggled a light, airy laughter.\n\"I'm certain that you are in the eyes of many.\" Leonel said with a smile. \"My companion has been a mute since her birth. Our family believes that this may have been the price to pay in exchange for our abilities…\"\nLeonel spoke of the story he and Aina had decided upon. Of course, he embellished a bit. Adding a hint of superstition common in this era. Of course, this story assumes that he and Aina are brother and sister.\nIn truth, on the surface, this isn't so easy to accept. Leonel had too many Hispanic features, while Aina herself was more northern European. However, Leonel knew that in such a situation, over explaining would be more eyebrow-raising.\nPeople tended to fill in the blanks themselves.\nAs expected, Joan paused for a moment, but seeing that Leonel didn't intend to explain, she accepted it in stride.\n\"I see… I hope there comes a day when your sister recovers, then. I am very interested by these abilities of yours, though. Can you tell me more?\"\n\"Even we do not know much.\" Leonel was sure to answer without holding any hesitation in his voice. He wanted to appear as though he trusted Joan completely and had no reservations about telling her everything. \"We only know that we are stronger, faster and quicker than others by a large margin. We can only call it an act of God. When we heard of your exploits, we felt that you were no better person to sympathize with us.\"\nLeonel felt that Joan's gaze softened slightly and her smile became more genuine.\nLike this, Leonel and Joan were ushered into Chateau Royal de Blois. Or, rather, they were led to a holding in the outer castle.\nCastles were functionally cities within walls. They were separated into several layers, of which had their own walls for protection, usually offset so it was more difficult to charge through their gates in one go.\nIt was actually already a privilege for Leonel and Aina to come this far. But, it also seemed that they had to earn their keep very quickly, because not even a day later, a march toward Patay was announced.\n'… So it begin… According to history, this will be Joan's final major victory. After this, King Charles will be crowned. She'll then fail to recapture Paris, before finally being captured in her battle for Compiegne.'\n**\n\"You say there are two more like you, Joan?\"\n\"Yes, my King. Because of them, we can move our battle for Patay up. According to General Franck, they all but annihilated an army of 20 000 strong by themselves, forcing them into a retreat. The brother in particular fought alone for half a day.\"\nJoan knelt before a throne with one arm across her chest, and another tightly holding onto a wooden crutch. Despite the fact Charles VII had yet to be officially crowned, she still called him King.\n\"Joan, have I not said you do not need to kneel before me when it is just the two of us? I've also said to call me Charles on such occasions.\"\nIf Leonel was here, he would likely once more be shocked. According to history, it was Charles who refused to give the order to save Joan when she was captured, leading to her execution.\nBut, the Charles of right now seemed to be almost fawning over the kneeling beauty. He was completely unlike the ungrateful King who abandoned her after getting what he wanted.",

      "content": "After the first failure to recapture Paris, the history books wrote that Joan was insistent on trying again, while Charles was adverse to the idea after securing his throne. He felt that she had become too difficult to deal with, and as such made no attempt to take her back from the English.\n\"My King, we must maintain proper boundaries. You are my liege, and I am your humble servant. God has sent me to be your protector, your guardian. It is impossible for me to be your wife. God will not allow it, nor would the nobles.\"\nWhether or not God would allow it, Charles didn't know. But, he was certain that she was correct about the latter portion of her words. They would turn a blind eye to him taking her as a Mistress, but a Queen? France would burn before they allowed a commoner to hold such standing. It simply didn't matter how much Joan had accomplished for them.\nCharles' jaw set for a moment before he sighed.\n\"Take however many knights you need. I'll be awaiting word of your victory.\"\nJoan gingerly stood and bowed once more, sweeping a glance toward a dark corridor to the back left of the throne and leaving without another word.\nThe moment she left, a shadow stepped out from the corridor, making its way to the throne's side.\n\"Did I not tell you that when I'm meeting with her you aren't to be in the vicinity? What exactly do you mean by so flagrantly ignoring my commands, Pierre?\"\n\"Forgive me, my liege. But, it is impossible for me to leave you with such a dangerous person. Punish me if you must.\"\n\"I'm well aware of what you're doing. Leave. Do this again and I will have you executed.\"\n\"My King, forgive me for saying so, but you cannot take this woman as your wife. You may think that this matter is only about her lineage, but this is not so. If she became your wife, would you allow her to go to the battlefield? If she carried your seed, would you allow her to charge toward the men of England?\n\"You are destined to be a King of legend. You must make decisions for the betterment of France.\"\n\"And would having a child that carries her blood and strength not be more beneficial than anything else? What if every King of France from now on wields her power? Would we not build an empire greater than Rome? Spare me.\"\n\"My King, you yourself already know that you've been blinded. Neither of Joan of Arc's parents had this strength, neither did her grandparents. It's impossible to say that this is hereditary.\n\"If my liege wants to take her as a bed mate, I will have nothing to say. If you'd also like to sire a bastard to test your theory, I will equally have nothing to say. But having thoughts of love, emotion and sharing a life with this woman is simply impossible, my liege.\"\nCharles stayed silent for a long while, saying nothing. Finally, he opened his mouth to speak again.\n\"Leave me.\"\nPierre bowed and obliged, slinking back into the shadows.\nHe walked along the corridor, his expression cold and dark. He looked like a man made of darkness, his robes a deep black, his nose having an exaggerated arch, and his chin being incredibly narrow.\nAfter a moment, he really did disappear into the shadows. It wasn't an illusion or a feeling, but the objective reality.\nHis body sunk into the ground, vanishing.\nWhen he reappeared, he was in a room dimly lit with candles dripping of wax.\nThree men lay sleeping upon slabs of rock. Upon his appearance, they stirred, almost mechanically sitting up.\n\"The Battle of Patay is a must have victory for His Majesty. Go.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThe three men inexplicably slipped into the shadows as well.\nPierre slowly walked across the room after they vanished, appearing by an alter with a closed black book. He stroked the cover almost affectionately, but also somehow simultaneously felt afraid to open up its pages.\n'The Bishop will lead us to glory. Our names will go down in history…'\nA dark glow emitted from the book.\n**\nJoan expressionlessly walked, leaning heavily on her crutch through the corridors of the main stronghold. Her face would sometimes flicker into a smile when she passed by someone, but the smile would just as quickly fade once she had passed.\nIt took over a long, but she eventually made it back to the outer walls to find the very same ten knights who had followed her out to greet Leonel and Aina.\n\"Get ready.\" She said plainly. \"This will be an important battle.\"\nHer smile was strikingly missing. Looking at her like this almost gave one a severe case of cognitive dissonance.\n\"Did those bastards make you angry again, Sister?\"\nThe knight who spoke got a sword hilt to the back of his head, causing him to cry out in pain.\n\"Is it time yet, Sister?\"\n\"No. The time isn't ripe.\"\n\"Must we really continue to win battles for them?\"\n\"God has a plan, Michael. Believe in the Bishop. When this is all over, our names will ring throughout history. We will be the ones who bring this forsaken Earth closer to God.\"\nJoan grabbed her flag. A golden glow emitted from its pole, radiating out like rays of sunshine.\nShe used her one good leg to pull herself onto her white steed, sitting tall with her smile once more back on her face.",

      "content": "\"Jean!\" Joan's delicate cry reached her knight's ears.\nWithout needing more words, one of the ten knights by Joan's side charged out from the group, taking with him a group of at least fifty calvary.\nLeonel's gaze shifted to the flagpole in Joan's hands but his face remained expressionless. He was certain that it was invisible to others, but he had very clearly seen a line of Force leave Joan and enter Jean's body. In that instant, though it was difficult to get a read on Jean's stats since he was riding his horse, at the very least, his steed itself had a 10% increase in all of its physical stats.\nThe army was riding through plains currently, but there was a forest up ahead. Seemingly realizing that something was wrong, Joan sent a squad of fifty as the vanguard.\n'So that's Jean Poton…' Leonel thought to himself, running alongside the horses with Aina by his side. Quite frankly, he wanted to ride a horse as well. But, he simply didn't think he had the time to learn, so he hadn't even tried.\nAccording to history, Jean's action routed the English's sneak attack attempt and put them on their back foot. Because most of the hidden English forces were long bowman, the losses were devastating and completely tilted the battle in their favor. This battle ended completely without a siege.\n'But that… Is definitely not like history…'\nLeonel's sharp senses caught wind of something odd hidden within the shadows of the vanguard calvary. He had never seen something like it before, but it was more than enough to raise his alertness. As for Joan, she either hadn't noticed, or pretended not to. Leonel found it too difficult to read her.\nIn stride, Leonel pulled his atlatl from his hip fixing a dart to it and sending a line of silver piercing through the air.\nHe was quite aware of the kind of discipline an army needed, and was even more aware of how frowned upon it was to act without the words of your commander. But, Leonel was playing his role as a commoner. How would a commoner be aware of such things?\nHis dart zipped through the air, causing a sharp intake of breath by the men still charging with him. The reason was that his throw was not only far too fast, but it went straight through the squadron of 50 as though without a care for their lives.\nLeonel wasn't focused on the reactions of fellow soldiers, though. His eyes were entirely focused on the white feathered dart.\nIt soared through the air, narrowly missing several vanguard knights. Just before it left the group, it just passed over a slowly appearing shadow.\nAs though startled, the shadow quickly ducked back into the ground, appearing as though nothing had changed. But, Leonel's dart continued to fly, entering the forest of trees and leading to the pained cry of a hidden archer.\nAs the leather armored Englishman fell from the tree, several incredulous gazes made their way toward Leonel before a morale infused roar washed over the Frenchmen.\nJoan swept a glance toward Leonel from her white horse, but she received an innocent grin and a thumbs up in return. He looked no different from a kid happy to be of help for the first time. With that, any thought of reprimanding him she held vanished.\nThe vanguard unit swept into the forest. It went without say that not every archer could hide away at the top of a tree. If this forest was so thick, it would never be on the route of their destination. Most of them tried to hide off the side of the path, waiting to rain down arrows after they passed through, but what they hadn't expected was such a prepared response.\nBy the time Leonel's unit swarmed the forest, the English were in chaos.\nHe swung his spear from his back, feeling a familiar burning in his blood. Aina trailed closely to his back. This sort of environment definitely wasn't the best for her battle style. That wasn't to say she couldn't fight. In fact, she could go through these trees like butter. The issue was how the other soldiers would deal with the trees falling in her wake. Taking this into consideration, she didn't act.\nLeonel didn't go out of his way to find and kill Englishmen. He took advantage of the complete disarray the battlefield was in to cut a straight line toward Jean's squad.\nBack when he threw that dart, those shadows had definitely peaked out of the ground several feet. Yet, no one but him seemed to notice. It made sense if a few didn't notice, or maybe even the majority, but not even a single person reacted. That only meant one thing: others couldn't see them.\n'It must be the state they were in. In order to enter that shadow-like form, they're essentially becoming an amalgamation of Force. But, normal humans can't perceive Force. And, Force wielders with weak senses can't see it either. Since the brain can't interpret what's right in front of it, the Force becomes a blind spot!'\nThere was something that confused Leonel even more, though. Those shadows clearly hadn't had any malicious intent. In fact, that shadow in particular hadn't been targeting the knight, but rather the bowman hiding in the tree.\n'Is that Joan's ability?'\nLeonel and Aina flashed through the thin forest like two wisps of smoke. Their speed was faster than that of horses to begin with, so catching up with Jean's group hadn't been anything difficult.\nAs expected, lying in wait on the opposite side of the ambush and outside the forest, there was another group of Englishmen waiting. But, the disorderly sorry looking Frenchmen they were waiting for never appeared. Instead, Jean had perfectly formed up his squadron.\nRaising his pike and roaring, he charged, a bright golden glow surrounding his power.\n\"In the name of God! For France!\"\nThe front line of the Englishmen was blasted apart by a forcefield-like force. Their foremen were thrown from their stances, suffering severe broken bone before the battle even truly began.\nReality didn't deviate from history. In fact, with Leonel and Aina tacked on, the result was even more devastating. The Battle of Patay this time around wasn't just a resounding victory, it was a trouncing.\nAnd, also just like history, the following weeks continued the trend. The French Army, under the leadership of Joan, swept through north-central France, leading a line of victories right to the gates of Reims where Charles VII would be crowned.\nIn that time, Leonel and Aina became no less famous than any one of Joan's knights. Though they didn't wear the armor, nor have the steeds, their results were undeniable. Joan didn't even attempt to rein them in, allowing them to act freely within the armies as they saw fit.\nBarely over a month, several territories around Paris had fallen and the threat of the Burgundians — traitor French of the last generation — fell along with the English. In just a few more days, Charles would be officially crowned in Reims, the very place the near fall of their Nation started.",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 200 powerstones. Next bonus chapter at 300.]\nLeonel collapsed on a bed stuffed with hay. The last month had really been far too tiring. And, to make it worse, for fear of exposing himself to Joan as a person who knew much more than he should, he hadn't practiced [Dimensional Cleanse] at all either. This was on top of the fact that he hadn't eaten his fill even once in these past few days.\nThat said…\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.95; Speed: 0.91 (+0.1); Agility: 0.99 (+0.1 - partially nullified); Coordination: 1.05; Stamina: 0.99-1.10 (+0.05 - nullified); Reactions: 1.05; Spirit: 0.30; Force: 0.20]\nDue to the fact Leonel was running obscene distances almost everyday, the residual medicinal properties of his dad's smoothies began to eek out more and more, causing his strength, speed, agility and stamina to take leaps forward.\nBut, this wasn't Leonel's greatest discovery. Since running from battlefield to battlefield was so monotonous, and there wasn't exactly great entertainment when they did rest, Leonel spent much of his time calculating the perfect positions for his next eight Force Nodes.\nHe came to realize over time that the more he used his ability, the stronger it seemed to become. In fact, the bump in his coordination and reactions was precisely due to this indirect increase. On top of this, due to this improvement, he found it hard to pin down his stamina with any sort of accuracy anymore, so he left it as a range.\nBecause of his calculative mind, Leonel had the ability to make the movements of his body incredibly efficient. It was for this reason his ability impacted his coordination, and likewise his reactions. However, for the same reasons, it could also improve his stamina, but it varied depending on how much of his calculative abilities he focused on making his movements waste less energy.\nBy now, Leonel was completely certain of the positions of his next seven Force Nodes. He was only having a bit of trouble pinpointing where the last should be.\n\"Are you two free?\"\nThe sudden words from a familiar voice at the entrance of his and Aina's tent caused Leonel to quickly sit up, sending a glance toward Aina who was lying with her back facing to him. She happened to looked toward him at the same time.\nThe two hadn't exchanged many words since that day in the carriage. Leonel didn't exactly know how to feel about that. But, what he did know was that he could trust her.\n\"Yes, Michael? Did the scouts find something?\"\nMichael lifted the curtain of their tent, poking his head in with a smile.\n\"Nothing like that. Sister just wants to see you two. I'm not sure why, so don't bury the messenger in questions.\"\n\"Oh!\" Leonel perked up, playing the role of excited fanboy he always had. \"Right away, then!\"\nMichael grinned. He had always liked Leonel's attitude. Much of the army found his naiveté to be refreshing. Leonel had always been quite used to being well liked through multiple social circles, so making new friends like this wasn't very difficult.\nHe and Aina rose from their makeshift beds, following quickly after Michael.\nThe army was housed in encampments on the outside of Reims, but the King who had traveled from Orleans here, and important officials were on the inside of the city. Leonel was surprised to find that Michael actually led the two of them into Reims itself.\n'I guess it makes sense that she would stay inside the city. Charles couldn't allow the primary reason he regained this territory to muddle around with normal soldiers.'\nLeonel didn't think much of it and was eventually brought to a mansion. The specifics about it, he was uncertain of. Was she just lounging here? Was it rewarded to her? He didn't know. He could recall the main details of the timeline, but such small matters were long since forgotten by him.\nMichael left without a word, leaving Leonel and Aina to walk into an office area by themselves to find Joan turning around to greet them with a smile on her face.\n\"Leonel, Aina, it's good to have you here. Have you been treated well?\"\nAina had learned to read and react to Leonel given certain clues. It was fine if she was a mute, but not understanding the language would be too suspicious. So, when Leonel nodded, her quick reaction time set in and she too nodded.\n\"That's good, that's good…\"\nJoan hesitated for a moment, causing Leonel's heartbeat to immediately slow. Well, it wasn't that his heart really did do this, but rather that he had subconsciously sharpened his reactions, causing even what was fast to be perceived far easier to him.\n\"I have indeed called you two here for a very important reason.\" She took a deep breath and sighed. \"I've been lying to the two of you for a very long time, for that… I apologize. I know more about our God given abilities than I've told you.\n\"If you're willing to forgive me, I can take the two of you to meet the Bishop —\"\n\"The Archbishop?\" Leonel's eyes lit up like a child, as though already forgiving Joan. \"We get to meet him?\"\nJoan was stunned for a moment before smiling sweetly. \"Yes, the Archbishop.\"\nLeonel's supposed ignorance played through well. However, his mind was spinning.\nThe importance of religious figures in this era couldn't be understated. The difference between a Bishop and an Archbishop was massive. Joan would never make such a mistake. That meant she meant to call out the title Bishop. But who was this Bishop that she was willing to allow Leonel to mistake for the Archbishop?\nWas it a deliberate act of blasphemy? Or was she trying to spare his feelings by not calling out his ignorance?\n\"The Archbishop is our true Godsent messenger. He is the one who leads my path and told me of my destiny. While he is in Reims prepared to crown our liege, I can take the two of you to meet with him.\n\"I thought I was alone in this world until I met the two of you. If you join our cause, then the bright future we hope for will be in a hand's grasp. Our names will resound through history.\"\n'She seems sincere, she really believes that she was the only one… So the shadows really must be her ability. That makes sense, after all, they did nothing but help the entire way…'\nLeonel excitedly nodded. \"Of course, of course!\"\n\"Good, then follow me. I will take you there.\"\nJoan smiled and turned toward a bookshelf. As though straight out of a fantasy novel, she pulled on one of the spines and caused a doorway to open.\n\"These paths were tunneled under the city so that important religious figures and royals can escape in case of a siege. It'll be easier to take them than winding through the city for hours.\" Joan casually explained.\n\"Wow! I didn't know something like this was possible. The Archbishop really must be God's messenger.\"\nJoan smiled and led the way, completely missing Leonel's disappointed gaze as the bookshelf clicked closed behind them.\nHe had said it himself before. Sometimes over explaining revealed much more about the truth you wanted to hide. However, somewhat incredulously, he was certain that Joan meant them no harm.\nIf she really believed she wasn't harming them, then who was this Bishop? Where was she leading them? And which entity could create such a large network of underground tunnels in this era?",

      "content": "'She's gone in a circle six times already… She really takes me for a fool…'\nLeonel gazed toward Joan's slender back.\nIn reality, maybe it wasn't Joan's fault. Leonel's calculative abilities were too sharp and he hadn't revealed anything about his true powers just yet.\nHowever, where she was at fault was in the fact that though Leonel portrayed himself as innocent and somewhat ignorant, he never pretended to be stupid. This Joan was looking down on him too much. Leonel was certain that he would see something wrong with her actions even without his abilities.\nThe tug of war in Leonel's mind raged on. On the one hand, he truly couldn't bring himself to see her as an enemy. But, another side of him was constantly hiding the most important aspects of himself as though instinctually.\nLeonel felt that his ability was somewhat tempering his more emotional side, and he decided that he didn't particularly dislike that fact. But, he still needed to make a decision.\nShould he continue to follow Joan? Or… Should he steel himself and kill her here?\nWithout Joan, completing the hidden quest would be next to impossible. The morale of the Frenchmen was almost entirely reliant on her. And Charles wasn't eager to attack Paris to begin with.\nHowever, a hidden quest was ultimately a hidden quest. They could leave this place without completing it. Though, Leonel wasn't exactly sure of the ramifications for doing so.\nIt had to be said that though this was structured like a game, Leonel was keenly aware that it wasn't. The 'side', 'main' and 'hidden' quests all had their own purpose. Their ultimate task was to deal with the anomaly in the timeline and save the present from being eaten away by it. How important completing the hidden quest was to that end… Leonel didn't know.\nHe could only make decisions based on the information he had. And, according to Aina, this Sub-Dimensional Zone might very well be a Unique Zone. In such a case, with so many potential variables, the quicker they could get out… the better.\nLeonel's jaw set. This was probably the first real test his new morals faced. Was his conscience really fine with taking on this burden? Was he really okay with taking the life of a woman he had dined with? Shared life and death with? Exchanged laughs with?\n'… No. I'm not okay with it…'\nLeonel made a decision. The relationship he had built with her, shallow as it might be, warranted Leonel following to the end of this path. If danger lied at the end, Joan would be his enemy. It was as simple as that.\nIt was a naive decision, a foolish one even. The smartest thing to do was to take out the spear he had used Aina's special pockets to help hide and stab her heart through her back at this very instance.\nIf he did this, he and Aina's lives would be guaranteed. Whether they succeeded or failed in recapturing Paris, they would be able to leave this place. But… He didn't.\n\"We're here.\"\nJoan stopped at a shorter than normal latched wooden door. It had almost been impossible to see in the shadows, one might easily miss it if wandering around randomly… almost like how hidden Joan's smile was in this darkness. Leonel could only barely make out the whites of her teeth and the blues of her eyes even with his sharp senses.\n\"I cannot follow you in, the B — Archbishop has very strict rules. Even I am not allowed to see him freely. Take hold of this opportunity well, it could change your life.\"\nJoan didn't wait after unlatching the door for Leonel and Aina, bowing slightly to them almost out of an odd habit that didn't seem to fit the situation. Then, sidestepping to go around them, she aimed to leave.\n\"… I hope I'm wrong.\"\nLeonel's words were spoken in a striking English. The change was so jarring that Joan froze. She had only just brought her shoulders level with Leonel's, but she didn't dare to turn and face him despite the fact his cheek was barely a meter from her own.\nThat tone… It held a level of command and conviction to it that Joan couldn't overlap with the Leonel she had come to know.\nIn her opinion, Leonel was almost perfect in every aspect. His abilities, his loving and caring demeanor, he was even handsome. His only flaw was that he was a bit simple, to put it nicely.\nTo say it plainly… she liked him far more than she liked Charles.\nHowever, the moment his words entered her ears, despite the fact she couldn't understand what they meant, she felt a sense of loss she couldn't explain. For a long while, she wasn't even certain if she had simply misheard or imagined it all. By the time the beating of her heart had stopped, the latched wooden door had opened and closed.\n**\nLeonel and Aina appeared in what seemed like a stone-built underground sewer system. There were many semi-circular arches along the sides, branching out into several other tunnels with winding paths of their own. But, there was a distinct lack of the horrid smell or dampness one would expect. In fact, it was oddly spotless.\nIf the branching archways were ignored, the corridor was at least 20 meters wide. About 200 meters ahead, there was a dead end. Its wall seemed impossibly high, the kind of structure that had no business being underground. But, there it was.\nStill, even with this being the case, there was something else that pulled Leonel's attention away. It was a simple wooden desk. It had three draws attached to its two legs on the right side, and two bare legs on the left. It wasn't even two meters across and had nothing but a single candle lighting its entire surface.\nBefore this desk, a gray-haired old man wearing worn gray robes sat, his back to them, curving as though he was too worn to sit straight.\n\"So you've come… Tell me, I've always been curious. What is the world like a thousand years from now?\"",

      "content": "Leonel's pupils constricted. To his side, Aina tensed up. It was only then he registered that this person had spoken in English.\n\"… Who are you?\"\n\"Me?\" The old man replied. \"I'm a nobody. Just a curious old man. I guess it's not very polite to ask a question without answering one first, so do you mind answering mine now?\"\nLeonel's gaze narrowed. Something was wrong with this place. He didn't quite understand it, but Force was far more dense here than it should be. In the 1400's, the amount of Fourth Dimensional Force should have been minuscule.\nBut this wasn't even close to the most important point. Who was this person and how the hell did he know his and Aina's true identity?\nThe old man sighed. \"There's no need to be so tense. Us three will be here together for a long time. Isn't it best if we get to know each other…? I spent all that effort learning that ugly… English, they call it. I'd like for it to not be useless, if possible.\"\nThe gray-robed old man slowly stood, pushing a chair that seemed it might collapse at any moment back and grabbing a bulbous wooden cane head.\nWhen he turned to face them, his slumped back straightened with a crack. It was like his formerly frail appearance was just an act. Such a simple action caused the air around him to speed up before settling back down.\nThe lower half of his face was covered in a gray mustache and beard that swept over his collar bone. However, his upper half wasn't as wrinkled as one might expect. It seemed that if he took the effort to shave, he would look no different from a normal 40 year old man. Even Leonel's own father only seemed to be a bit younger than that.\n\"I guess we got off on the wrong foot. I believe my name is pronounced … Nicholas, in your English. I can't say I hate this tone of address, though, I prefer the original Nicolas. I'm sure you've heard of me.\"\nLeonel inwardly cocked an eyebrow, though he remained deadpan. There probably were famous Nicolas's in history, but Leonel would be lying if he said he knew who this person was. Was he supposed to know?\nNicolas stretched his limbs. It seemed the cane he held in his hand was just for show.\n\"… You want to keep us here?\"\n\"Of course. I can't have you ruining my plans.\"\n\"Your plans?\"\n\"I might decide to tell you after you can no longer interfere. Won't be long. I'd say, uh…\" Nicolas stared at blank space for a while. \"… about a month. Probably two just to be safe.\"\nLeonel frowned. He didn't understand, what could possibly be done in two months.\nIt would probably take at least that long before Charles was officially crowned, but so what? According to the true timeline, that was meant to happen.\nWait, maybe he was thinking about this all wrong. According to history, Paris wasn't captured either. But, it was their hidden quest to reverse that course. In fact, they would be greatly rewarded for it. So maybe the measure they should be measuring their success against is how much they did change as opposed to how much they kept the same?\nLeonel's brain spun, he couldn't grapple with the conclusion he needed.\nWas it really Charles coronation this Nicolas wanted to ensure?\nJust as Leonel's ability was working in overdrive, a subtle shadow appeared by Nicolas' side. However, no matter how subtle it was, Leonel was too alert at this point to miss it. His senses latched onto it instantaneously.\n'Huh? Isn't that Joan's ability?'\n\"Ah, Pierre. You shouldn't be here, if you're gone for too long it could be a problem.\" Nicolas said casually.\n\"These Invaders are a danger to you, Sire. I cannot leave them to you alone.\"\n'There was another of them? So it wasn't Joan's ability at all, but rather someone else this whole time…'\nLeonel sent a gaze toward Aina. She seemed to look this calm all the time now, he hadn't seen her shy expression for a while. But once again, it seemed that his one sided decisions had put them in danger again.\nNicolas sighed. \"You're always too overzealous, Pierre.\"\n\"Sire by the hand of God gave me strength. I am simply doing what I can to return what should be returned.\"\nSuddenly, something clicked for Leonel.\n'The weird concentration of Force… The month timeline he set… His words to this Pierre…'\nLeonel's eyes widened. \"Aina, my spear!\"\nAina reacted quickly, pulling an impossibly long spear from and impossibly small pocket. Even as she threw it to Leonel in a swift motion, she pulled out two smaller battle axes. Her main ax couldn't fit, however, in order to pretend as though they hadn't taken their weapons with them, she had had no choice but to leave it behind.\n\"Tsk…\" Nicolas frowned. \"… How unexpected.\"\nLeonel finally understood what was happening.\nA year from now is when Joan's fabulous reign would finally come to close. This concentration of Force was no different from the concentration of the future Earth's. Then, Nicolas warned Pierre that he couldn't come here or else he might be gone for too long.\nLeonel was certain. This place no longer had a ten to one time dilation and a month was exactly what would need to pass in order for a year to go by outside! And, he was sure that if he turned around now to attempt to open the wooden door, he might not even find it, let alone open it.\nDid this make Joan an ally? No. Leonel had already settled his heart into killing her.\nThis might confuse others. A month was about the time it would take a year to pass in the world outside that latched wooden door. And, a year would be what it took for Joan to be captured by the English and then executed. So, why was Leonel in such a hurry? If he planned to kill her anyway, why was he in such a rush?\nIt was because Leonel had realized something. What mattered in these Zone quests wasn't the end results, but rather the process.\nWhy were there side quests to kill such-and-such number of enemies? Why was the main quest to kill a woman who had already been killed later anyway? Why was the hidden quest to recapture a city France would eventually recapture in the future? Everyone knew that Paris had been a part of France up until the 21st century, so obviously they had taken it back at some point…\nIt was then it all clicked for Leonel. It wasn't just what they did that mattered, but when they did it as well. These Sub-Dimensional Zones were ticking time bombs!\n\"Don't hold anything back.\" Leonel said with a fierce light in his eyes. \"Go all out.\"\nLeonel flashed forward, taking control of the vanguard with Aina holding her twin axes to his back. All he had on his mind was taking them down and escaping this place before Joan could leave to lay siege to Paris for the first time.\nWhatever it was that happened during that first siege which ended in her first failure, had set in motion a history that was detrimental to their future.\nThe hidden quest wasn't just a completion addicts dream… Just like Leonel thought, this wasn't a game. Everything had a purpose. The hidden quest was a clue!",

      "content": "Leonel's decisiveness caught Pierre and Nicolas off guard. They had been observing Leonel for a long time and had never expected that he had this side to him.\nTheir surprise informed Leonel of another important point: it was impossible for them to know of the mission requirements. If they knew that he was tasked with killing Joan, they would also know that much of the front he put on was an act. Taking it even further, they wouldn't have let her lead him and Aina here alone either.\nThinking to this point, this whole situation made much more sense. They didn't know what they were trying to stop him from doing, so their best response to was to lock them away to avoid any unwanted variables.\nBut, that begged another question… why had they waited for so long?\n\"By the power of God, I beseech you energies of the world! Rage of wind!\"\nUnfortunately, there was no more time to think.\n\"I'll handle the shadow.\" Aina's voice drifted to Leonel's ears.\nWith a nod, the two hit another gear. Leonel had already seen through the stats of Pierre and was more than confident in her ability to handle him. As for Nicolas, he was more difficult to manage as all spirit based entities were. But, the current Leonel was nothing like the Leonel of the past.\nBefore, he had struggled with the C-grade Mayan Priest more than even a B-grade Invalid. But now…?\nStreaks of pressurized wind shot through the air. Leonel realized that this ability was nearly identical to the that of the Mayan Priest. It was a reality that brought his antennas up, however there was still a difference between this time and last.\nWhereas before he could only faintly sense them, now, he could very clearly see them streaking through the air. And, with all of the mystery gone… they even looked crude and uncontrolled.\nThey were fast, but not uniform in width. Their shape was similar to an earth worm with irregularly sized segments. If Nicolas had better Force control, this 0.90 points of agility his attack had would easily be over 1.00.\nLeonel's head ducked to one side, slipped by one worm-like wind projectile, sliding past another, and leaping over the last.\nHis movements were fluid and confident, his gaze filled with a calm stillness to them. The Leonel of today was already a far cry from the teenage boy who first stepped into the Mayan Temple.\nThough he had been surprised, Nicolas was still greatly confident in his God given ability. However, he had never expected Leonel to deal with them so calmly and so easily. It was to the point where Leonel didn't even consider using his atlatl. He truly didn't feel like he needed it.\n\"By the power of God, I beseech you energies of the world! Shield me!\"\n'So it was a one way facing shield? In that case…'\nLeonel closed the rest of the distance to Pierre and Nicolas in less than 20 seconds, his gaze flashing with a dazzling light that made his pale green eyes gain a life to them they didn't usually have.\nLeonel's speed exploded as Force surged through his body.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.99; Speed: 0.99 (+0.1 - nullified); Agility: 0.99 (+0.1 - nullified); Coordination: 1.15; Stamina: 1.10-1.20 (+0.05 - nullified); Reactions: 1.15; Spirit: 0.40; Force: 0.20]\nLeonel's sudden burst caught the two opposing him completely off guard, allowing him to slip between them and to Nicolas' back in a swift sliding motion.\nAt that moment, Aina, in perfect trailing position, followed up with two swings of her dual wielded axes, cutting off Pierre's path toward supporting Nicolas. Her teamwork with Leonel was seamless, without even communicating, she was able to take cues from Leonel's dodging to deal with Nicolas' attacks just as easily as he did.\nLeonel set his feet, his arm flexing as he pulled his spear back tightly against his body. He pierced forward with enough momentum that his attack caused a sharp whistling noise to sound as his blade cut through the air.\nNicolas' back was completely exposed. There simply wasn't enough time for him to react.\nThe attack was flawless, controlled, and perfectly aimed toward his heart.\nCLANG\nA strong reverberating impact shook Leonel's arm as Nicolas was sent flying into his own energy shield.\nViolent coughs racked his lungs as the wind was knocked out of him. The painful groans of his body slamming against his own shield made Leonel certain that he had broken at least his nose, if not something far more substantive.\n\"The lord will protect me from all harm! By the power of God, I beseech you energies of the w—.\"\nLeonel hardly reacted to his failed attack. He had conditioned himself long ago to be prepared for setbacks. It was impossible to predict everything that would happen on a battlefield. Those who ended up on top were those who could read and react to anything. And unfortunately for Nicolas, he didn't seem to be one of these people.\nThere was another thing that seemed to be identical between Nicolas, the so-called Bishop and the Mayan Priest: they both chanted before using their Force. The only difference between then and now was that Leonel could actually understand what was being said and didn't tune it out.\n'[Call of the Wind].'\nThis chanting might have been part of their fanaticism, or maybe it had a purpose that Leonel couldn't see through, but regardless of the reason, it made timing the next attack far too easy, and countering… even easier.\nA glow coated Leonel's spear as he pierced forward once more. Before Nicolas could even finish his next words, a sharp wind traveled across the distance between them, leaving a bloody hole in his forehead.\nAs he fell to the ground, Leonel understood that Nicolas only placed him on his radar after he met Joan. Leonel had displayed this very attack on the way to Orleans, yet Nicolas had clearly been completely unprepared for it, confident to the very end. Even Leonel couldn't have guessed that things would end so easily.\nWhen he turned around to check how Aina was doing, there was no chance to see Pierre's shock, because he had already fallen, hacked to pieces by the savage red glow of Aina's axes.\nLeonel sent a gaze back toward where the two of them had come from, only to be disappointed that the wooden door didn't reappear.\nHe took a deep breath. The first task was done, but he had a feeling that leaving this place wouldn't be so simple… If they failed to find a way out through these maze of tunnels, they would be stuck in this Zone until the last of their days…\n\"… You should take a look at this.\" Aina suddenly said.\nAina threw over a black book she took from Pierre's body.",

      "content": "Leonel, who had still been thinking about the best method to get out of here, blinked and looked over toward Aina. He caught the hefty black book in the air, surprised by its weight. Just what could make a seemingly normal leather bound book so heavy?\n\"I can't understand what's written in it.\" Aina said. \"But I do feel a sense of familiarity from the diagrams. They feel like Force Art.\"\nLeonel's brow raised. \"Force Art, are those different from Force techniques?\"\n\"Force Art are a type of Force technique, so not really…\" Aina explained lightly.\nSeeing that she didn't seem to be in a mood to talk, Leonel didn't ask more questions despite having them. He just made the assumption that what separated these Arts from normal techniques were these diagrams Aina mentioned.\nLeonel had seen diagrams in [Dimensional Cleanse], but they were of the human body, nothing like the diagrams Aina was speaking of now.\nAina struggled a bit seeing that Leonel was having trouble getting anything out of what she was saying, so she couldn't help but say a bit more.\n\"Force techniques are split into internal and external. Your [Call of the Wind] is an internal technique. Force Arts are external techniques. The difference is that one originates from the body before it can be projected out while the latter can be formed outside of the body. Force Arts are rarer and more difficult to learn and control… I don't know why something like them would appear here, it doesn't make sense.\"\nLeonel couldn't help but smile when Aina continued to explain unprompted. He could tell that she wanted to keep her distance from him, so he hadn't pressed her in the last several weeks.\nBut he had learned that Aina was incredibly soft-hearted, a side of her he was quite fond of. She would often get that very same guilty look on her face whenever she felt she was being too harsh with him. So, he didn't mind shamelessly taking advantage.\n\"I see…\" Leonel mumbled. \"I would have thought that [Call of the Wind] was an external technique due to its original nature, but I guess this is a case of instincts being incorrect.\"\nThough Leonel felt he would need some time to wrap his mind around this, he knew that this wasn't the time for this. There were far more pressing questions, even aside from how they would get out of this place. Namely… just who were these people?\nNot only did they know that he and Aina were from their future, but they also had access to Arts which even Aina spoke of as a rarity.\nThe formerly ignorant — well, more ignorant — version of Leonel would think this was incredulous. However, the current him who was now aware that the future could apparently change matters of the past was much more interested in just what was going on here.\nCould it be that Earth's metamorphosis had changed history so drastically? Was it maybe instead that history was always this way? After all, even the Mayan Priest had a Force weapon that he had no business having. Or, was there maybe some other unknown reason Leonel didn't have enough information to reach?\nAll Leonel knew was that this was big. Bigger than maybe his current self had any right to even think about, let alone deal with.\nFrowning, Leonel finally opened the front cover of the black book. Every second here counted, and if he was correct, it actually counted for ten times what it should. There was no time to waste, or else they would fail this quest and be stuck here until their deaths.\n[Shadow Manifestation]\n'So it wasn't an ability but a technique he was using?'\nThe more Leonel read, the deeper his frown became. This technique, or rather, this Art was gruesome. It required etching the Art into one's skin with deep gashes to the bone. Pierre was most definitely a fanatic for putting himself through this.\nHowever, this also explain something else to Leonel. It was no wonder he had seen multiple shadow figures. Each of them probably had an Art etched onto their bodies, giving them this ability.\nLeonel described what he found out to Aina, causing her to frown. At first, Leonel thought she was just grossed out by the methods, but when she spoke again, he realized that this wasn't the case at all.\n\"Something's wrong…\" She said faintly. \"… From what you describe, this Pierre should have been much weaker. But, his abilities were far more wide ranging than what that book describes.\"\nThough Aina still defeated him easily, that said more about her abilities than it did about Pierre's. At the very least, she gave him more credit than the book did.\n\"Could it be that he maybe had more than one Art and he stacked them?\"\nAina frowned for a moment before shaking her head.\n\"I don't think that's possible. All of his abilities seemed to fall under the same umbrella and were all related to the shadows. In addition, external Arts that fall under the Body Art category like this are still limited by the physical fitness of the person in question. With this person's level of constitution, it should be impossible for him to handle more than one etching without imploding.\"\nLeonel raised an eyebrow, what exactly was Aina getting at?\n\"Where does the book say it's best to do the etching?\"\n\"Well… It says that the best place is directly onto the heart, but that's next to impossible. Its secondary suggestion was to compensate for lack of quality with size and draw as large of an etching as possible. So… The back.\"\n\"Can you…\" Aina blushed slightly.\nLeonel understood her instantly and went over to Pierre's corpse. Holding down his feelings of discomfort, he flipped the latter onto his back and ripped his robes apart. He believed that Aina most definitely had a good reason for asking him to do this.\nBut, he was stunned to find that there wasn't a single scar on Pierre's back. In fact, it was so pale that one could even see greenish blue veins pumping with the last of his life force.\nLeonel tilted his head in confusion. 'Maybe he couldn't handle drawing such a large Art so he drew on a lesser body part?' He thought to himself.\n\"… It's as I thought…\" Aina's voice interrupted his words to himself. \"… Someone studied Pierre's awakened ability and converted it into a Force Art, allowing it to be passed down, in part, to others…\"\nHearing these words, Leonel was left speechless.",

I can't fathom what level of intellect it would take to do something like this. It's even more impressive that this person managed to keep the final product simple enough that it could be used.\"\n\"If even you say it's impossible, then how are you so sure? How did you even guess at all?\"\n\"I'm very sensitive to things related to bodies… abilities, even if they manifest with the same or similar result very rarely have the same process. I might have superior physical strength, but the reason that I do is because my true ability is related to an innate sense I have for what the body needs and what changes it has undergone… It's a bit difficult to explain in a few words, but it's ultimately the reason I was slotted in as a Five Star health professional.\"\nLeonel's brows raised. This was the first time he had heard of Aina's profession.\nWhen it came to the Gene Assessment and its results, the more general the title you were given, the more talented you were. To be named as a 'health professional', this was about as general as titles came, while 'quarterback', in Leonel's case, was about as specific as you could get.\nSimply put, anyone who birthed a child like Aina was basically guaranteed to rise up in the world no matter what their original standing was. That said, considering the wrist watch on Leonel's arm had informed him that it understood less than 5% of his DNA, how accurate could his own Assessment have possibly been, then?\n\"Thanks to my ability, I subconsciously know the best way to train my body. It's because of that that my physical stats are so high. The limitation of my ability, though, is that it doesn't seem to carry over into Force.\"\nThough there was nothing special about Aina's words, and even despite the life or death situation they were currently in, Leonel couldn't help but smile. He just liked learning more about her and liked it even more when it was her speaking to him about it.\n\"… What are you smiling about?\"\nLeonel coughed lightly. \"Nothing. Nothing at all.\"\nAina quirked her head in confusion, but gave up on finding a real answer from Leonel.\n\"What should we do?\" Aina asked.\nLeonel took a deep breath. \"I can sense that if we blindly try to leave through these tunnels, we'll only fail miserably. I feel that we're stuck in a cage right now and the power backing this cage won't fade for a long while. But, staying here for just a week would allow more than two months to pass in the outside world, by then, it might already be too late…\"\nLeonel sighed. \"I'm sorry, this is my fault… I should know better by now. If I don't change —\"\n\"Don't!\"\nLeonel's words were abruptly cut off by Aina. He couldn't help but look toward her with shock hardly concealed in his eyes.\n\"… Just don't say that.\" Aina's voice became soft. \"Let's focus on how to leave this place instead, okay?\"\nLeonel's mouth opened and closed several times before he finally nodded.\nTaking another deep breath, he walked toward the only things left to analyze in this place.\nFirst, he picked up Nicolas' staff, weighing it in his hands. It was a shame that Nicolas died before truly using this cane's power. It left Leonel in the dark about how it actually worked, but it was more important to defeat him more quickly so as to avoid any unwanted variables.\nIt was odd. Leonel felt that this cane was different from the Mayan Priest's sacrificial dagger somehow.\nAfter sensing everything he could at a surface level, Leonel walked to the small desk at the end of the sewage tunnel, his eyes narrowing at the sheets of loose tan colored paper.\n\"These diagrams… Are they Force Arts as well?\"\nAina gaze narrowed when she heard this, swiftly making her way to his side.\n\"It really is… What do these say?\" Aina looked toward Leonel's side profile.\n\"Is it not possible to understand Force Arts from the diagrams themselves?\" Leonel asked curiously.\n\"Remember the analogy about writing?\" Aina answered with a question.\nLeonel's mind spun. \"You're saying that Force Art is akin to a Third Dimensional existence writing in the 2D?\"\n\"Yes, Force Arts are rare. Those who can draw Force Arts are rarer. And, those who can create Force Arts for others to replicate are even rarer than that. I've only seen a few Force Arts. On top of that, the language that this Nicolas uses is very different from anything I've ever seen.\"\nLeonel's eyes flashed as he suddenly thought of something.\nIn what seemed like an act of madness, he brought Nicolas' cane over his knee and powered his leg up hard, snapping it in half.\nAina was shocked by his actions, but after seeing what was inside of it, she suddenly understood.\nThe wooden cane was completely hollow. After angling a candle to light its insides, it was possible to see countless small etchings of Force Arts on the inside. And, judging by the fact that aside from inks and pens, Nicolas' desk also had several pen-shaped knives, Leonel and Aina could easily deduce that they were drawn by him.\n\"This style, or language, is identical to what's in the black book.\" Leonel said.\n\"You can tell?\" Aina's eyes lit up with a bit of surprise.\n\"Can't you also? You just said this language was different from what you were used to… I assumed by that that you could tell the difference.\"\nEven though Leonel couldn't read Japanese, Chinese or Korean, he could easily tell the difference between their characters. It wasn't just him, it was a pretty easy task for any person who was even somewhat familiar with them. He felt that these diagrams were the same. Even if he couldn't understand them, he could still see through the fact they had the same basic foundation.\n\"… I can't.\" Aina replied. \"Force Arts are shrouded in an energy that makes them hard to observe, it's part of what makes them so hard to comprehend and use, and even harder to make. I only know that they're not the same because I can't see through that shroud. If it was a similar language to what I'm used to, it would be easier for me to do so.\"\nLeonel's brows arched with understanding. But, there was one part he was still confused about. Why was it that he didn't feel a shroud impeding him at all?\nOnce more, Leonel could only toss these things to the back of his mind, unable to provide an answer to Aina's curious gaze.\n\"… Why do you think that Pierre would have a book like this but Nicolas doesn't?\" Leonel suddenly said after several hushed moments filled with nothing but the sound of rustling paper.\nAina frowned, not knowing what Leonel was getting at.\n\"I have a feeling that drawing these Force Diagrams is Nicolas' ability. But…\"\nLeonel's gaze flickered with a blazing light. He walked back to Nicolas' corpse, stepping through the leaking blood and tearing open the back of his robes.\nLeonel stood to his full height as his jaw set. There it was, the massive etching mutilation they were looking for. Except… It was on Nicolas' body.\nSomebody had given him this ability.",

      "content": "Leonel's expression gained a bit of dignity. They hadn't been here for long, yet so many inexplicable things were unfolding before him.\nGritting his teeth, Leonel made a decision.\n\"I know how we can get out of here.\"\nAina was just as intelligent as Leonel was. Though her thinking speed fell several steps behind him after he awakened his ability, when given enough time, her conclusions wouldn't be much different from his own. This was why when she heard this, her expression immediately changed.\n\"No. No. Absolutely not. We can think of another way. You have no idea what kind of side effects there might be. I won't let you.\"\nLeonel smiled bitterly.\n\"I wish I knew more about this world, but unfortunately I don't. This is the only solution I can think of, and considering the current abilities of my mind… That's saying a lot.\"\nAina's eyes involuntarily reddened.\nLeonel walked to Nicolas' desk and picked up one of his pen-shaped knives. He looked at it before a moment, hesitating. He didn't even notice when Aina's small hand crossed his field of vision and clamped down on the palm he held it in.\n\"It's too risky.\" Aina tried to steady the trembling in her voice. \"We don't understand the diagrams to begin with, who knows what it will do to you? For all we know, Nicolas didn't even have his own will.\"\nLeonel's jaw clenched. Sure enough, Aina had thought of the main danger as well.\nLeonel was certain that this place was being held together by a large scale Force Art. The problem was that neither he nor Aina were experts in the matter. Walking around blindly could land them in an even worse situation than they were already in.\nThough it might be possible for him to try and deduce the mysteries through Nicolas' countless notes, he had no confidence in doing so in a short time.\nHowever, if he drew this etching onto his body, he should theoretically gain the ability Nicolas had, allowing him to comprehend these Force Arts quickly. With the processing power of his mind, as long as he had this starting point, deducing what he needed to know to get them out of here would be the simple part.\nThis sounded all well and good, but he might have a frightening price to pay for his ignorance. Joan worshiped Nicolas more than she did even the Catholic Church. Yet, they had very clear evidence here that his strength was handed to him by another. Who knew what the goals of this person was and what contingency plans they had left behind?\nLeonel's heart had been unable to settle itself. Knowing that the destination ahead only had one path, yet it was fraught with danger, left him in a steadily darkening state. But somehow, Aina's hand, despite being so much smaller than his own, completely dispelled those thoughts.\nHe suddenly smiled warmly, his back straightening.\nHe lifted Aina's hand from his palm, his gaze flickering when he noticed that the sharp etching tool he had been holding onto had cut into her.\nAlmost somewhat on instinct, he ripped a piece of cloth from his linen shirt and carefully bandaged her hand.\n\"Of the two of us.\" He spoke lightly as he worked. \"I am the best option to do this. With my ability, I'll be able to make the best use of it. Plus, I won't need to draw it as large as he had to to achieve a better result. It'll be fine.\"\nAina's hand trembled beneath Leonel's tender actions. Then, she could only watch blankly as he set her hand down and drew the first slice of flesh across the back of his left hand.\nLeonel's memory was frightening after awakening his ability. Without a single pause, he drew the complex Force Art across his skin, the only sign of his pain being his tightly clenched jaw.\nForce Arts could be made stronger with both depth and size. However, the Art Leonel drew was barely deeper than a usual paper cut and was a fraction of the size of Nicolas'. But, Leonel was confident that his own ability could amplify this Art's would-be potency, while also mitigating the risk he put himself in.\nEven so, blood flowed continuously from Leonel's hand, dripping down and ricocheting off of the stone beneath their feet. The dull echoes rebounded across the walls of the underground sewage system, giving the atmosphere an eerie and damp feel.\nLeonel's coordination stat was exceptionally high. It took him not more than a few minutes to etch the Force Art into his skin.\nHe had been expecting a grand showing when he finished, but the reality didn't have much fanfare. There was a faint wisp of light and a subtle comprehension clicked in Leonel's mind. What was once gibberish became as clear as a text of English to him.\n'So that's how it is… Aina was right. Drawing Force Art is like an author writing down a story. But that also means that if you want to influence a Dimension, you must be applying pressure from a higher Dimension. This isn't just good news… It's excellent news!'\nLeonel grasped on a very simple fundamental concept like it was his last beacon of hope.\nThe bad news was that whoever it was truly had placed some failsafes in place, failsafes that made Leonel tremble to his core. He didn't know exactly what they were, but his analytical mind could already see through the parts of this Force Art that contributed nothing to its main ability of passing down this power of understanding. It didn't take a genius to figure out that these parts were where the hidden danger lied…\nThe good news, however, was that this Force Art was an attempt of the Fourth Dimension to influence the Third. However, Leonel's body was a half-step above the Third Dimension and was on its way to evolving toward the Fourth due to Earth being in its Metamorphosis and him having lit his first Force Node.\nAs a result, the contingency plans this mysterious person left, had barely a portion of their effectiveness left.\nThis also meant that the knowledge Leonel was gaining was also severely hampered, but it was a worthy trade-off, especially considering Leonel's calculative abilities!\n\"LEONEL!\"\nLeonel snapped out of his thoughts, his head sharply turning toward Aina.\n\"Don't scare me like that!\" She pounded the side of her fist into his chest, a move that would have likely sent him flying in the past.\nLeonel grinned. \"Aina… That's the first time you've called me by my name…\"\nAina blinked for a moment then blushed profusely, turning her head away.\nLeonel's expression turned more serious with Aina distracted. He could feel the subtle workings of energy chains trying to worm their way from his left hand into his body. He had no choice but to send a steady stream of Force to crush it time and time again. The drain on him was immense.\n'We need to finish this mission as soon as possible. Only by going back to the present will this Force Art completely lose its effectiveness…'",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for reaching 200 powerstones. Next at 300. Take advantage of this, because judging by how things are going now, I'll probably have to increase the requirements next week lest my fingers fall off]\nLeonel pushed these worries to the back of his mind. He refused to allow Aina to worry. She was still in a precarious state though her symptoms hadn't flared up in a while. Though he wasn't certain what might cause her to sink back into that state, it was best if he kept her calm right now.\nEven aside from this, there was something else on his mind as well. He wanted to make this Force Art on his body as useless as possible as quickly as possible, but that didn't mean he didn't want the knowledge within it.\nIf he relied on the Force Art entirely, then as soon as it lost its ability, the knowledge would go along with it. However, if he went out of his way to make this knowledge less instinctual and root it into his memory, then regardless of this whether it continued to work or not, the knowledge would become his.\nWhoever it was who created this Force Art most definitely had a devastating ability. Leonel couldn't fathom what kind of power someone who could translate numerous abilities into Force Art wielded. However, no matter how much of a great genius this person was, they had ultimately miscalculated this time.\nLeonel's ability couldn't be considered a counter to this mysterious person's. But, what it was, was an ability capable of exploiting a weakness. And that was exactly what Leonel intended to do.\nAfter taking a deep breath.\n\"Give me half a day. Half a day is all I'll need to organize all of this information.\"\nAina nodded solemnly. She knew that half a day was already worth five days to the world of their quest. By then, Charles would already be crowned and the French would begin marching toward Paris. However, she knew that it was useless to try and rush Leonel. If he couldn't do this, then they wouldn't be getting out of here at all.\nWithout hesitation, Leonel leaned against a stone wall and crossed his legs, his mind entering a deep state that seemed almost like slumber.\nCompared to the abilities of others, Leonel's really seemed too lacking. He didn't have a flashy amount of strength, nor could he erect energy barriers like James or control things through the air like Yuri. However, only Leonel knew just how truly formidable his ability was, and the next few hours would prove this.\nNicolas had spent his entire life integrating the knowledge given to him by that unknown person he worshiped like a God. He had lived over 60 years before the time of his death and over 50 of those had been spent in diligent study.\nHowever… Leonel had confidence to surpass him in just half a day!\nThe first and foremost reason Leonel chose [Dimensional Cleanse] was because he instinctually felt that it could raise the potency of his ability. He hadn't even known about the so-called Star Cleansed Bodies before.\nNow, though, he knew that these Star Cleansed Bodies unlocked levels of potential your body would never have otherwise. Even without having formed his First Star yet, Leonel felt that his ability was far stronger than it had been in the past. And he knew… That he could make it stronger.\nA strong surge of Force erupted from Leonel's body, causing Aina's expression to immediately change. She wanted to rush forward and stop Leonel, but it was already too late. She no longer dared to stop him for fear of harming him.\n'You idiot!' She roared in her mind.\nA faint wisp of a smile curled Leonel's lips as though he could hear her thoughts. And maybe it was due to that, but the anxiousness in Aina's heart faded.\nThere was truly nothing to worry about. This time, Leonel wasn't putting his life on the line. Even with those Force Chains trying to wiggle their way through his body and take control of him, Leonel didn't have the faintest drop of worry in his mind.\nIn the last few months he and Aina had been here, the reason they hadn't wasn't due to the fact they hadn't accumulated enough. Leonel could have formed his second Force Node a very long time ago. In fact, he could have likely formed his fifth or sixth by now had he not been obstructed.\nThe only reason he hadn't was because he didn't want to be found out by Joan. Aina had similar reasons for not forging her Seventh Node.\nThat said, in this time, Leonel hadn't been idle. Not only had he calculated the perfect locations for up to his Eighth Force Node, but he had simulated their creation hundreds of times in his mind.\nThis was the first true tangible ability Leonel awakened after forming his First Force Node. When he entered a deep sleep like the one he had just now, he was able to think at a speed even several times that of his wakeful state. In addition, he could perform incredibly realistic experiments as well.\nLeonel felt that these experiments were only about 70% aligned with reality as he still hadn't reached a level of being able to simulate everything perfectly, but this 70% was already more than enough, especially when Leonel ran the simulations of the same events countless times over.\nIf there ever reached a day where he could simulate the world perfectly, then just one simulation would be enough!\nLeonel called this ability Dream World. With it, he could perfectly calculate how to rearrange his cells to make room for a Force Node in advance, allowing him to complete the real thing with not only exceptionally high success rates, but also at speeds others could only — somewhat ironically — dream of!\nAina could only stand in a daze as she watched Leonel swiftly form his Second Node. It took him no more than half an hour! And in her shock, she almost didn't notice he had begun forming his Third Node… And it too only took him half an hour!\nA rush of Force surged toward Leonel from all directions. The torrent was so furious that Aina's lovely hair whipped about wildly, almost like the waters of a waterfall crashing to the rivers below.\nThe momentum of the birth of Leonel's First Star was far beyond his expectations. In his shock, he realized that the Force that was holding up the surroundings was actually being sucked dry!\nOne of the reasons Leonel had dared to do this was because the Force in this place was actually somewhat denser than even Earth. But, even if it was, it was almost a fraction of a fraction the size of Earth.\nThen, there was a dull BOOM. It almost sounded like a bag of sand hitting the ground, and following it, the Force in the surroundings all but vanished.\nLeonel's eyes opened with a bright flash, his body glowing as layers of skin fell from his body. It wasn't just skin that fell, but even his hair did as well, leaving him completely bald. As if this wasn't already enough, but a foul odor came from him as dense brown-black liquids were forced out from him at the same time.\nHowever, he didn't have a mind to think about any of this because he met Aina's shocked gaze with a shock gaze of his own. Then, he could only smile bitterly.\nIf he had known he only needed to breakthrough to leave this place… Why would he have etched this damnable Force Art on his hand?\nTo make matters worse, after destroying this pseudo Fourth Dimension during his breakthrough and returning to the Third Dimension, the ability of the Force Art to exert its strength multiplied, causing the Force Chains attempting to latch onto Leonel to grow several times in power.",

      "content": "Just when Leonel was feeling truly regretful at his lack of knowledge, his expression changed when he realized that the odd cage they were in was rapidly converging energy to reform itself.\n\"Aina, do you have a big enough pocket to keep all of this stuff?\" Leonel pointed toward the desk filled with loose sheets of paper. \"Never mind, we don't have time. Come on.\"\nLeonel grabbed Aina's hand and sprinted with all his might, even activating his Force without reserve.\nAina seemed stunned at that sudden contact. But, she was even more stunned by Leonel's speed. Was this really someone who had only formed three Force Nodes?\nIn a flash, the two had crossed the 200 meter distance to the location of the wooden door that had appeared once more. With a single movement, Leonel swung it open, shocked at how impossibly heavy it was.\nIt didn't take him long to understand. This was a door designed to be easy to open from the outside, but extremely difficult without special methods from the inside. It was precisely this door that, when closed, completed the Force Art that created this space.\nA roar escaped Leonel's lips, his arm bulging with ghastly veins as he pulled with all his might, ripping the door from the hinges.\nOnly when this happened did he finally relax, his breathing steadying. As expected, the surging feeling he had had before came to a stop.\nOne might argue that he shouldn't have been so panicked since he only needed to break through to shatter this space again. However, even though he knew where he should place every node up to the Eighth, he couldn't form them in quick succession without regard.\nAfter forming his Third Node, Leonel faintly felt that his body was like a bulging balloon that was about to burst. If he had used his Dream World to simulate what would occur during the formation of his Fourth Node, it would likely be that he would implode.\nIn addition, he realized another thing. The closer to the Fourth Dimension he became, the more difficult simulating things became. He could simulate matters related to the Third Dimension with over 90% accuracy. In his previous state, he could simulate matters related to his body with 70% accuracy.\nNow, though, despite the fact forming his first Star had greatly strengthened his ability, he felt that his accuracy was only 73%. However, since the improvement in his ability was far more than just a mere 3%, that meant that simulating the matters of his body had actually increased in difficulty.\nIt seemed that this path of his wouldn't be perfectly linear. There would definitely be some give and some take.\nHe needed a few days to allow his body to acclimate itself to his Third Node, only then could he attempt to form the fourth. And, though Joan only died a year from now, there were countless events that happened between now and then. Without delving into the gritty details, what's important was that she might very well be marching toward Paris in just a few days.\nHe didn't have the time to slowly improve his strength, and he wouldn't have such a perfect environment to do so like he just had either. To make matters worse, if the formation of his Third Node took so much Force, how much would his others take? No, that wasn't right. It was the formation of his First Star that had taken so much energy.\nSuddenly, Leonel felt a strong tug on his hand.\nLooking down, he blushed slightly in embarrassment as he let go of Aina's hand.\n\"Sorry.\" He said apologetically.\nAina's little nose wrinkled. \"You stink.\"\nLeonel smiled bitterly. This was already the second time since he had known Aina that she had said such a thing to him. But it couldn't be helped, what exactly was he supposed to do about this? He hadn't expected that forming a One Star Cleansed Body would have such results.\nIn the past few months, he had noticed that Aina was most definitely a clean freak and he also deduced that the black military outfit she wore that was filled with pockets definitely had a self-cleaning function, because he hadn't seen her take a bath even once but she still somehow smelt so good.\nOf course, if he knew that this clean freak he liked so much had helped him clean up while he was unconscious all those weeks ago, it was unknown how he would react.\n\"What should we do now? I really didn't expect that we would escape so soon.\" Aina said softly.\nHearing her, it was only now that Leonel realized that she wasn't certain that we would have escaped at all. Not only did this make Leonel feel more guilty about putting them in such a situation, but it warmed his heart at the same time. Because despite feeling this way, she still hadn't wanted him to risk etching this damned thing on his hand.\nThinking of the Force Art against, Leonel gazed at his hand to find that it had healed during his breakthrough and formed faint bumps that looked like a brand.\n\"We were lucky.\" Leonel said after taking a deep breath. \"We were only in there for a little over an hour, so barely half a day has passed. Joan will likely be setting out either today or in a few days toward Paris. This is a good opportunity.\"\n\"You want to get there first and prepare?\"\nLeonel nodded. \"Without adequate preparation, we'll definitely suffer major losses. I can't believe this is a Zone they designated for two people.\" Leonel continued, feeling aggrieved. \"I believe you, this has to be a Unique Zone, that's the only explanation.\"\n\"…\" Aina's mouth opened for a moment before she muttered in a small voice. \"… Sorry.\"\nBut, she had spoken so softly that Leonel didn't catch her words.\n\"Let's rush to Paris. We'll definitely make it there first. We can scout out the situation and wait for Joan to arrive. It will also give me a chance to digest the information in this Force Art.\nIf it was really so easy to get rid of a Force Art, Leonel would just endure and shave a layer of skin from his hand. But, it obviously wasn't so easy to deal with it or else Aina wouldn't have been so worried, he could deduce at least that much.\nSince now he had to use half of his Force to keep these chains at bay, he might as well gain some benefits from them, or else they really might have no chance of clearing this Zone.\nHowever, just as Leonel was firming up his resolve, Aina said something that almost made him fall to the ground.\n\"… Do you know how to get to Paris from here?\"",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 300 powerstones. Next at 400]\nMaps, especially during the middle ages, were incredibly expensive. Even a simple map would be worth hundreds of gold coins. Obviously, despite having been here for a long while, neither Aina nor Leonel had such funds.\nIf they didn't have a map, they would have no choice but to follow Joan's army from a distance. But if they did this, then the advantage they had in movement speed would be nullified and they'd lose their chance to prepare in advance. If this happened, their chances at changing history and capturing Paris would end in failure.\nLeonel almost slapped his forehead. How could he forget something so important.\nAfter frowning for a moment, memories gradually surfaced in his mind.\nDuring his studies, since he had chosen French, he had of course seen many historic maps. It was just that the maps in these textbooks were incredibly crude and simple and would at most point him in a general direction.\nAfter a while, Leonel shook his head. This wasn't good enough. A single mistake could throw them hundreds of miles off course.\n\"We're going to need to raid the military camp.\" Leonel suddenly said.\nAina nodded seriously. This really was the only choice.\nThere were probably cartographers in such a large base, but did they have the time to find out where they were? And even if they did find them, they would be within the city walls, something that would put them at a great disadvantage.\nAt the very least, the military camp definitely had what they were looking for. In addition, if they were found out, it would be comparatively easier to leave the military camp as opposed to a fortified castle.\n\"I couldn't leave my ax behind regardless.\" Aina said.\nLeonel grinned. \"Let's do it, then.\"\n**\n\"Big sister, where are Leo and Aina? We'll be setting off tomorrow morning and our chances at victory will be much better if they're with us.\"\nMichael was seemingly the only one in the meeting of commanding officials who didn't have a solemn expression. All of them knew how difficult it would be to retake Paris, so obviously they weren't in the mood to smile. As a result, while the nobles were off drinking and eating, celebrating the new crowned King's ascension to the throne, they were diligently planning.\nA wisp of a complex emotion flashed in Joan's eyes, but she quickly hid it.\n\"They've been taken in by the Bishop. Their role is different from ours.\"\nSurprised expressions appeared on all those in the room.\nThough they worshiped the Bishop, they had never actually seen him like Joan had. All of their knowledge of him was by proxy of their big sister. So, not only were the surprised, but they even felt a bit jealous.\nThat said, it couldn't be helped. They didn't have great abiltiies like Joan, Leonel or Aina. They had expected this result long ago. But, hearing it now made them feel a bit inferior.\n\"Forget these matters, there'll obviously come a day where you're all rewarded for your service. Is there a need to feel sad? The disciples of the Apostles never met Jesus, but did they mope around like you few? Keep your heads up.\"\n\"… We got it, big sister.\" Michael pouted like a child. \"But won't Aina be needing her ax? How could she leave it here?\"\nMichael had no other intentions with his questions. He really was just asking innocently. However, there were others among their band that had weird expressions on their faces having heard this.\nAt this moment, Aina's massive ax was leaning on a wooden weapon rack at a corner of the military tent. But, this wasn't the most important point. The key here was that Joan had moved it from Leonel's tent to place it here. There wasn't anything inherently wrong with this action. After all, they would be heading out soon and Aina wasn't here. But, it just felt like there was something they couldn't put their finger on.\nJust as Joan was about to try and dispel the awkward atmosphere, a voice suddenly came from the tent's entrance.\n\"Hello? Miss Joan? Can I come in?\"\nJoan blinked in astonishment, because the voice was actually Leonel's. What was going on?\nMichael laughed happily. \"Come in, come in! We were just talking about you, you lucky bastard.\"\nLeonel's grinning face poked through the flaps to find the few of them having a meeting around a table. Since it was late, the space was illuminated by numerous candles. But, despite the fact it was a military tent, it carried a delicate fragrance that made it obvious a woman lived here.\n\"Leonel? Why are you here?\" Joan asked as Leonel stepped into the tent.\nOriginally, Leonel had planned to use force to take what he needed. But then he shook his head. When had he become such a brute? The game of American Football seemed like a game of all brawn, but he'd lost count of how many times he had won a game with his mind instead of purely his arm. The National Championship was just another example.\nLeonel made a gamble. He gambled that Joan, even if she knew that the Bishop's purpose was to kill him, she most definitely wouldn't want others to know this. Leonel was too well liked in the army for her to act against him openly. Even now, the solemn expressions of those commanders here had gained a wisp of a smile when he entered.\nIn addition, there was also the chance that Joan only had a feeling that the Bishop had bad intentions and no solid proof. In that case, she might even sigh a breath of relief that he had come back instead.\nThere were other possibilities as well, but they all ultimately led to the same conclusion: Joan couldn't do anything to him right now!\n\"I came to bid you all farewell.\" Leonel smiled brightly, casually sweeping a glance at the strategy maps spread across the table. \"The Archbishop has given my sister and me a special mission.\"\nA few expressions of sadness crossed the faces of those here, causing Joan's expression to change. Since when had Leonel's prestige become so great? However, hearing Leonel address the Bishop as Archbishop rested a rock that had been hovering above her heart.\nLeonel laughed and exchanged a few words with the commanders, embracing the likes of Jean and Michael like they were friends separating from a long while.\nA long while later, Leonel turned to leave before smacking a palm to his forehead.\n\"I almost forgot. If I left it behind, my sister would kill me. Thank you for keeping it safe, Miss Joan.\"\nUnder a chorus of laughter, Leonel hurriedly scurried to the back of the room, picked up Aina's massive ax, and left with an embarrassed expression.",

      "content": "\"Sister, what's going on?\"\nHours later, when the moon was high in the sky and darkness had enveloped the land, Jean was the only one left in Joan's tent.\n\"What do you mean by that. Jean?\"\n\"Don't lie to me, sister. Why did Leonel say that the Archbishop had given him a mission?\"\nWhen Joan heard Jean emphasize the word Archbishop, her pupils constricted. That was right, Leonel had said Archbishop, but all of the commanders beneath her command referred to him as the Bishop. It was an incredibly small detail, but it was a detail someone as intelligent as Jean would never let slip by.\nDid this Leonel do it on purpose? There were others just as intelligent as Jean under her command, it's just that only Jean was close enough to her that he would confront her like this. Or rather, it could be said that their relationship…\nJean's arm wrapped firmly around Joan's slender waist, holding her tightly to his body.\n\"Jean.\" Joan said somewhat furiously, her glare seeming to hold an indescribable power behind them.\n\"I thought our relationship was better than this.\" Jean said with narrowed eyes, meeting her fierce gaze. \"Do you think I'm a fool? What death mission did that bastard send Leonel on?\"\n\"Jean! Watch your mouth —!\"\nShe was about to scold him fiercely for his act of blaspheming the Bishop, but a pair of rough lips had covered her own, completely stifling her attempt.\n\"Joan, you are my woman. I don't know if this person you follow is really God or not, but this is one thing that I most definitely do know.\"\nTo these words, Joan's reaction was unexpected. Her gaze seemed a bit dim, it was completely unlike a woman who was supposedly in love. It was as though she was resigned to her fate.\nHowever, the situation was simply too odd. Joan's standing was clearly higher than Jean's, so obviously it wasn't possible for him to force her into such a relationship. Whether it was backing or individual strength, she left him behind by far. It could only be said that their relationship was almost impossible to understand.\n\"Joan, you are a woman too shackled by responsibility and the imaginary. You realize just as I have that there is no God in this world. Or, at the very least, even if there is one, it is most definitely not the God we grew up worshiping. Since things have reached such a level, why do you still allow yourself to be tied down?\"\nSeeing that Joan still seemed to have no intention of responding, Jean released her. Though there were flames lighting his loins right now and he also knew that Joan wouldn't resist if he took her to bed now, he didn't want to touch her when her eyes were so vacant.\n\"Do you know the reason I've allowed you to stay by that Bishop's side all this time despite my being certain that he was just using you? It's for no other reason than that I wanted you to see it for yourself. Would you have listened to me had I said it earlier?\n\"But now you've seen it for yourself. He has no qualms about tricking a kind soul like Leonel. In that case, what do you think he would be willing to do to you?\"\nThere was finally a change in Joan's expression. A wisp of complexity and sadness pervaded her gaze. However, no matter how she searched, she really couldn't find an answer.\nGod was an important part of her life. This was something ingrained in her from youth. It simply wasn't possible to separate herself from that lofty entity.\nHow much pain had she suffered in her life? She was nothing but a teenage girl, yet she was leading groups of men in battle. How much burden was laid upon her shoulders? No one really knew but herself.\nBut wasn't that what faith was? Wouldn't her pain be repaid in the end? This was nothing more than a test of her resolve.\nJoan's gaze became firm once more.\n'This will be the last. This is the last test. Then, I'll be laid to rest and enter the Heavenly Gates…'\nThe times she had to go against her conscience? That was simply a test of her loyalty. The times others suffered due to the choices she made? That was simply the test of their loyalty. The world was that simple to Joan.\nThe God she had known in her youth, maybe he really didn't exist. But, there was a new God before her now, and he was real and tangible. She had seen it with her own eyes, the kind of power he wielded, the kind of power he could bestow.\n'Bishop! I won't let you down!'\nDespite seeing Joan's gaze regain their light, there was no happiness on Jean's face. In fact, the smile he held faded. And, seeing this, it was Joan instead who smiled.\n\"Jean.\"\nJoan's voice was so soft that Jean felt that his knees lost their strength. Under the dull lights of the flickering candle light, she heard the clang of armor drop to the floor and a slender hand slip into his. He had hardly reacted by the time he noticed that he was being led toward Joan's bed.\nIt wasn't long before a softness that made his mind go blank enveloped him.\n\"Make me forget for another night.\" Joan placed her lips to Jean's ear, standing on the very tips of her toes as the last of her clothes fell to the ground.\nHer hot breath carried a moisture with it that spread an uncontrollable warmth throughout his body. At that moment, he seemed to have completely forgotten about his complex emotions and envelped Joan's soft bottom in his large hands, lifting her up from the ground and piercing through her without reserve.\nA spine tingling moan was barely muffled as she bit down on his neck. Like a young girl swaying in the sea, she accepted all Jean had to give, holding onto his neck with her seemingly weak arms.\nWith each powerful stroke, the lust and resolve in her eyes grew.\nBut she had no idea that her 'God' had already died.",

      "content": "The Paris of the 21st century, before it was destroyed during the Empire's war for supremacy, was known for its romance and the Eiffel Tower. However, though it might still be possible for the France of the 1400's to be known for the former, it would still be 400 years until the latter was built. But, that didn't mean that Paris didn't have its grand sights, much to Leonel's aggrievement.\nThe grand sight this Paris was known for, unfortunately, was a massive castle that dwarfed both Leonel and even Aina's massive ax in size. It stretched almost as far as the eyes could see and its fortifications made the knees of its attackers weak.\nBoth Aina and Leonel stood a good distance from it, not wanting to alert the Englishmen of their arrival. Even though they had broken free of the French, let alone the English, even most of the French army was completely unaware of this. So, if they got caught now, there would definitely have to be a bloody battle.\n\"This is the city we're supposed to capture? What a death mission.\" Leonel muttered.\nAina stood by his side silently as they looked toward the tall greyish white walls in the distance. Though her expression had hardly changed, there was a trace of seriousness in her eyes.\nLeonel sighed. \"We're still lacking in information. What is Joan coming here to do? If her goal really is to capture Paris like history says it was, why is it our goal to kill her?\"\nThere were too many things the answer to this question hinged on. For example, if Joan's goal was the same as theirs, should they work with her at the start and only kill her later? What if her goal wasn't the same as theirs? Should they kill her as quickly as possible to avoid later variables and try to capture the city on their own? Could they even do that if it was necessary?\nThe longer Leonel spent in Zones, the more he realized just how important information was. If they had wrong or even incomplete information, it could lead them toward doing something irreversible and get them stuck in this place for the rest of their lives. Leonel still shuddered at the thought of what would have happened to him had he killed the Priest's sacrificial virgin back in the Mayan Temple. He would have never seen his friends or family again…\nLeonel's gaze flickered. 'No matter what, my priority if we pass through this will be getting the best Zone Detector I can.'\n\"We don't know exactly what her goal is,\" AIna suddenly said, \"But, it's still possible to make a guess.\"\n\"What are you thinking?\"\nAina bit her lip for a moment before continuing, her gaze still focused on the massive castle in the distance.\n\"First, remember that capturing Paris is just the hidden quest. We only need to complete the main quest to get the chance to leave.\"\n\"But…?\" Leonel felt like she was leading him somewhere.\n\"But, there's a reason hidden quests exist. This isn't a game. Everything has a purpose and not completing everything perfectly has consequences. If it was a weak Zone, then the penalty for skipping over a hidden quest wouldn't be severe, but in a potential Unique Zone like this one, the consequences could be dire.\n\"The main reason it's best to complete a hidden quest is due to the fact hidden quests are lingering dangers. When left incomplete, they can bleed into other Zones, causing mutations that evolve them and multiply their difficulty.\n\"Under normal circumstances, Sub-Dimensional Zones with higher Dimensional Grades than the world they're in will not appear. Meaning, since we are only in the process of evolving into the Fourth Dimension, Bronze Zones will not appear and only Black Zones will. However, if a hidden quest is left incomplete…\"\nLeonel broke out into a cold sweat. According to Aina's device, this was only an S-grade Zone. Even if it turned out to be a Unique Zone, its true difficulty wouldn't be too far from this. Yet, it had already almost killed them twice now. Once when Aina lost her mind and the other when they met the Bishop and were trapped.\nIf a mere S-grade Zone was already like this, what would a Bronze Grade Zone be like?\nThe worst part of this was that these things weren't entirely under their control. Even if they perfectly cleared their own Zones, what about everyone else?\nAt that moment, Leonel came to a sudden understanding.\n\"It's no wonder the Empire wants to gather everyone up. It really can't afford for everyone to work blindly on their own, or we could really be finished.\"\nAina nodded. \"Now, think back to your first Zone, how were the hidden quest and main quest linked.\"\n\"Originally…\" Leonel smiled bitterly as he remembered how this damned wrist watch almost got him killed. \"… Never mind. The main quest was to repel the Spanish and save the girl. The hidden quest was to kill the Priest.\"\nLeonel had barely finished when his gaze suddenly brightened. As for Aina, she shuddered when she heard his mission requirements. Leonel had to fight the Spanish? In other words… An army not unlike this one? Alone…?\nShe shook her head to regain her bearing\n\"Seems you understand now. The missions never conflict with one another, but what might matter is the timing. For example, your main quest is vague. Which girl? The only way for you to know which girl is to find out that girl is linked to the Priest you need to kill.\"\n\"Then that makes things simple.\" Leonel said. \"If they can't be contradictory, then Joan's goal is definitely not to save Paris. So, I should have just dealt with her earlier?\"\n\"Not necessarily. Like I said, timing is important. Though her goal isn't to capture Paris, she still has a purpose in coming here. And, it's likely that even if her goal isn't to capture this city, she will at the very least attack it. That is beneficial to us.\"\nLeonel took a deep breath. \"So that's it. We wait for her to attack while making sure she can't accomplish her true goal, whatever that true goal might be.\"\nAfter saying this, Leonel's heart steadied. This was most definitely not a simple task, but there wasn't much of a choice left.\n\"Aina, help me cut down a few trees.\"\nThere might have been a large mountain before them to climb, but Leonel had no intention of lying down. Since Joan had chosen to betray him, she was his enemy.",

      "content": "[You guys are gonna kill me. Bonus chapter for 400 powerstones. From next reset onward, it'll be 200 powerstones per bonus chapter so that I don't collapse *runs away in tears*]\nThe English were roaring with fighting spirit. The truth of the matter was that they had suffered successive losses over the last few months. It was to the point where they might be kicked out of France entirely at this rate. However, their morale was still raging.\nThe reason for this was simple. They refused to lose to such an enemy and they were the true elites of the English army.\nThey had been hearing stories about Joan for almost a year now. The idea that a woman was the one putting their armies in such a sorry state was a great humiliation to them. It was simply going against the will of God.\nOf course, the English had no idea that the real reason their morale was so high wasn't due to their own will at all.\nOn the castle walls, two men stood side by side. They wore silver armor and the English flag was painted on their shoulder guards. Both swept indifferent gazes at the roaring men on the tall walls and cold sneers toward the approaching French army in the distance led by a woman with flowing black hair and her knights.\n\"How is it, Reimond? Is she as much of a beauty as you thought she'd be?\"\nOne of the previously expressionless men grinned, sizing up Joan. If others saw how he was acting, they would definitely be shocked. After all, he spoke about Joan as though she was right in front of him and he could see her every detail. However, she was easily over a kilometer away. If it wasn't for the size of the approaching army and their high vantage point, it would be difficult to make out even her gender, let alone how beautiful she was.\n\"You like used goods that much?\"\n\"How do you know she's used goods?!\" The man rebutted.\n\"The Bishop is our savior, but he isn't a Saint. If he really let her go, he might as well castrate himself.\"\nThe man paused and seemed to think that this made sense.\n\"I don't know why I even bother to argue with you anymore.\" The man said. \"You pretend like I was seeking her out to be my wife. How could I marry someone who's destined for a coffin in a few months? I just want to have some fun.\"\nReimond glanced at the man but didn't say anything in response. It was only after Joan had crossed the kilometer mark that he finally spoke again.\n\"Nigelle. There's something wrong with the path of the winds.\"\nThe man, or rather, Nigelle, frowned at these words. The true reason he didn't like arguing with Reimond wasn't because he was no fun, but rather due to his ability. It was an ability that made it hard for him not to be serious all of the time.\n\"There might be some variables.\" Reimond continued. \"We should be prepared.\"\nNigelle's playful demeanor disappeared and he was once more expressionless.\n\"Archers!\" Nigelle's roar cut through the battlefield as he took his longbow from his back as slammed its lion shaped edge to the stone beneath his feet. \"Aim!\"\nNigelle himself didn't aim his bow. Its almost three meter tall form was held in his left hand, radiating such a faint glow that it was almost impossible to see.\nThe French army was still charging.\nOne Kilometer. Eight hundred meters. Seven hundred meters. Six hundred meters.\nThe rumbling of horses made it seem like the skies might collapse at any time.\n\"Set up a defensive line! Ready the cannons! Shieldmen forward!\" Joan's cries resounded over the battlefield.\n\"Fire!\" Nigelle's voice followed hers as the French crossed the 500 meter mark.\nIt felt for a moment that night had descended, a vast expanse of black covering the skies like hand enveloped the lands followed by the sound of the winds being torn apart beneath their might.\nThe French weren't slow. They reacted to Joan's commands, bringing the shieldmen forward to block the rain of arrows.\n\"Towers!\" Joan roared.\nTens of wooden towers came forward, hiding the violent power of their cannons behind their windows as they pressed onward.\nThe French crossed the 300 meter mark. Under Joan's commands, they flowed like the water of a rushing river. Nothing was rushed and everything was organized. If a war historian of Leonel's time were to witness such a scene, they would be shocked beyond belief. It simply wasn't possible for an army even of modern times to move so swiftly, let alone one of the middle ages.\nHowever, these things were simply beyond the normal realm of logic and reason. One only needs to look toward the faint golden glow of the large French flag in Joan's hands to understand that this was no longer just a battle of mortal men. The Gods had intervened.\n\"FIre!\"\nNigelle roared once more and a second volley came.\nMore men died horrible deaths. Though the shieldmen did their jobs as well as they could, how could it be possible for them all to come out unharmed?\nMaybe the most sickening part was that if one ignored the cries of pain and closed one's eyes, the sound of arrows piercing skin was little different from the sound of an arrow hitting the bark of a tree.\nHowever, very soon, the French weren't the only ones suffering, because the cannons Joan had asked to prepare were ready.\n\"Fire!\"\nThe tall wooden towars stopped just within 200 meters of the castle walls, the barrels of deep black cannons aimed forward before a cacophony of booms resounded.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nThe cries of the English sounded and the bloody battle that went down in history truly began.\nIn the distance, Leonel looked on with a serious expression. By now, he had already been in many battles. However, he had never set eyes on a siege before. Though he was prepared for it to be bloody, he really hadn't expected it to be to this extent.\n'We were right to move so far back.' Leonel thought to himself. 'That man shouting out commands and the one by his side are definitely not normal. They're also most definitely not the same English generals who fought this battle according to history.'\nLeonel took a deep breath and his frown deepened.\nJust what was going on? Who was scheming against Earth like this?\nBut there was an even more shocking realization that made Leonel's spine tingle with coldness.\nIt was only possible for a single group to enter a Zone at one time. Until that group succeeded or failed and died, said Zone would not open again.\nWhat did this mean? It meant that whoever was toying with the matters of the past now had been doing so for at least one thousand years already. How could they even begin to fight against such a thing?",

Their mad roars filled the skies as they charged toward their deaths. They seemed to be filled with courage and a sacrificial will, it was the kind of thing that brought a man and his family honor in any era. But Leonel… Just found the scene to be sad to look upon.\nWhat were they fighting for? Their country, of course. Maybe on a deeper layer, it was for their God. But was it worth it?\nLeonel wasn't the kind of person who looked down on others for their faith. He was questioning more so if their God even wanted this.\nLeonel shook his head. 'It isn't that they believe their God wants this… It's that they're being manipulated into believing so by those they trust the most…'\nBefore this, Leonel still had a hard time blaming Joan. Even though her actions almost led to his death, he had always been a forgiving person. Since he was still standing here, there was no harm, right? In that case, there was still a chance at mending their friendship.\nMany would call this sort of mentality foolish. And if they did, Leonel wouldn't argue with them. He too found it to be foolish. But, this was just his nature.\nHowever, after seeing this scene, the last wisp of understanding he had for Joan vanished. Whatever reasons she had no longer mattered to him. She knew how devastating her actions would be, yet she carried them out anyway.\nHow many innocent people would die today? A few thousand? More than that?\nLeonel had always heard that the wars of the past were child's play compared to wars during and following World War I. But, even if these death counts couldn't compare to the millions who lost their lives during those pyrrhic monstrosities, reading numbers from a textbook and witnessing it for yourself were two completely different experiences.\nIt was… unforgivable.\n'I can't keep letting them die like this while I do nothing but stand here and watch.'\n\"Aina…\" Leoenel looked over with an apologetic smile at the dainty fairy that stood by his side.\nShe was much different from the Aina that had always been in his heart. She wasn't wearing her usual long flowing dress, the kind that clung to her curves with the slightest gust of wind. Instead, she wore a black military uniform densely packed with pockets.\nHer hair wasn't as perfectly groomed, gently waving like the descent of a calm waterfall. Instead, it was quite tangled. Some of it even stuck to her delicate face with the help of her beads of sweat.\nEven her usual elegant demeanor was nowhere to be seen. The massive, murderous ax on her back was too good at crushing such thoughts…\nHowever, Leoenl found that he liked her even more now than he had in the past. Maybe it couldn't even be simply explained as 'like' anymore even if he wasn't sure how to express it. All he could say was that the way Aina looked… Simply didn't matter to him anymore.\n\"I've already said it.\" Aina said calmly without looking in his direction. \"Don't change.\"\nHer words seemed to have nothing to do with the situation. Even Leonel was confused by what she was saying. When had she…\nLeonel's gaze flashed with a bit of realization and he looked away from Aina's side profile and looked back toward the violent battle.\n\"Aina.\"\nHearing Leonel's voice, Aina trembled slightly. She knew well that Leonel had an exceptionally kind side to him, but there was another side that was full of resolve. It was that side of him that stood in battle against thousands of Englishmen and refused to let her go. It was that side this voice was from…\n\"I don't know enough about the relationship between you and your family. But, I do know that you've been avoiding me due to it. However…\"\nLeonel grinned wildly. \"You just said it yourself. You asked me not to change. So you tell me, do you think I would let the woman I like face such a thing on her own? Or is it that my Aina wants to take back her words?\"\nAIna was stunned stiff. Leonel had confessed to her 521 times. She didn't need anyone to keep count for her, she knew the number herself. She should have gotten used to it by now. However, it had been over a year now since the last time she had heard him say such things. She had almost forgotten how it felt.\nA moment later, her face flushed a blazing shade of red. It seemed like she would leak a fountain of blood if she was poked just once.\nUsually she would run away, but where would she run now? She couldn't leave Leonel behind in such a dangerous situation.\nAfter a while, she was so stifled that she stomped her foot against the ground, causing it to tremble and crack.\nLeonel's lip twitched. He had almost forgotten that this petite fairy before him was such a monster.\nTaking a deep breath, Leonel looked back toward the battlefield and those fluttering emotions in his heart faded. He knew how foolish his next actions would be. Originally, he should have waited for maybe even a few days of battle to pass by, only then would both sides be damaged enough for his plan to work perfectly.\nBut… he just couldn't stand by and watch these valiant men die while he knew they were just puppets on the strings of another. If he really did allow them to suffer for his own designs… How would he be any different from Joan?\n\"Let's go.\"\nLeonel shot forward, Aina, who had regained her composure following closely behind him.\nIn an instant, they had arrived on the battlefield and were immediately noticed by Joan and the two men on the castle walls, causing all three of their expressions to change violently.\nIn what seemed like a flash, Leonel and Aina crossed the defensive line of the tall wooden towers, entering a no-man's-land filled with French corpses.\n\"For France!\"\nLeonel roared as countless arrows rained down toward him.\nHis left arm flicked upward, causing his small shield to explode in size. Before it, the rain of arrows was no different from harmless water droplets. Both he and Aina were completely unharmed.\nIn the blink of an eye, two unknowns had made it to the city walls.\n\"Aina!\"\nAina nodded and pulled her massive ax her back while taking a rope from one of her pockets with her free hand.\nLeonel leapt into the air. He didn't need to look back to feel the violent winds of Aina's ax slamming toward him. But, she obviously wasn't attacking him.\nThe flat of her blade boomed against the soles of his feet as she tossed the rope in her opposite hand into the air.\nUnder the shocked gazes of the two armies, Leonel made it to the top of the castle and swung his massive shield, sending tens of Englishmen flying.\nHe looked back, finding the rope Aina had thrown up snaking through the skies and grabbing it without hesitation. He grasped it with both hands and pulled up with all his might, sending her to the top of the wall with one swift motion.\nLeonel retracted his shield and pulled his spear from his back and brandished it against his body with one arm.\nHe felt Aina's delicate back press against his own as she brandished her own weapon.\nLike this, the two faced swaths of enemies on both sides. Yet, Leonel's handsome face carried a wild grin while Aina's beautiful lips curled into a slight smile.\nA rare moment of silence descended onto the battlefield before the roaring cheers of the French resounded.",

      "content": "Despite the cheers of the French, Joan's golden helm hid an unsightly expression. If she wasn't certain before that Leonel's goal differed from her own, she was now.\nIn truth, even if he did this, it shouldn't have been so obvious so quickly. However, Leonel only had himself to blame once more. The reason Joan was able to realize there was something wrong with his actions was because of those words he spoke to her in English that day.\nNigelle and Reimond simultaneously turned their gazes toward Joan as though trying to gain an explanation. But, what they found in return was her warped expression, making the answer to their question quite obvious.\nThese two weren't one of them.\nOn the castle walls, Leonel and Aina stood back to back, facing enemies on all sides.\nFrom front to back, the walls averaged almost ten meters in thickness, so the number of knights and archers here was definitely not just a few. In addition, since there was so much space, the pair didn't gain any advantage due to the landscape.\nHowever…\nLeonel and Aina both took a strong step forward. Though it wasn't enough to shake the massive castle walls, the loud boom was enough for the warriors around them to look on in shock. Before they could react, tens more fell from the high walls.\nThis was only the first day of the siege. Or, rather, it really should have been the first of many days. As a result, most of the warriors on the castle walls were archers. Though there were some knights, they weren't high in number. With this, it became very obvious very quickly just how disadvantaged they were.\nAina and Leonel swept through them as though adults playing with children. The fear filled Englishmen were so shocked by the sudden shift in the battle that they didn't even realize that though many of them were being heavily injured, the majority of them hadn't even died.\n\"What's their…\" Nigelle was confused. What exactly were they trying to do? However, it was at that moment his expression changed. \"… The gates! Stop them!\"\nHe pulled up his longbow and was about to use it, but then his expression became unsightly. There was only a distance maybe 20 meters between him and Leonel, a distance that practically meant death to anyone who offended an archer like him.\nThe problem was that there were clusters of Englishmen in his way, there was no clear path for his shot!\nLeonel might have been a kind hearted soul who often did foolish things for the sake of his moral code, however he wasn't a fool.\nHe had guessed that Joan and these two men with abilities were working together. And, he guessed that if he and Aina just suddenly appeared, they wouldn't have time to communicate between themselves to understand what was going on. As a result, they wouldn't be able to stop them from getting to the top of the walls. And, if they couldn't do that, then…\nThe path to the gates would be too easy to reach.\nLeonel jumped up and onto the edge of the wall, sprinting along it at a speed that surpassed the human body.\nThere was no shortage of those who tried to push him off or knock him off balance, but his coordination stat had reached a level far beyond anything these soldiers could imagine.\n\"Charge toward the gates!\" Leonel roared.\nHis voice blanketed the battlefield, suppressing the cheering of the Frenchmen who immediately regained their senses. That was right, they were still in the middle of a war.\nLeonel and Aina had caused the archers to become completely disorganized on an entire segment of the wall. Even if there were more parts left unscathed, it was still a huge pressure off of them, especially since the part of the wall now unable to send attacks toward them was exactly the part that protected the draw bridge gates.\nFor a moment, it seemed as though Leonel had become their Commander and many forgot that they still had to wait for Joan's order. Maybe it was the confidence in Leonel's tone or the fact he was very much used to leading groups of men or maybe it was that they all had taken a liking to him in the past few months, but they completely disregarded everything and charged forward like madmen.\nSeeing this, Joan's visage darkened even further. This was completely out of her control. What could she do? Tell them to come back? What kind of blow would that strike them?\nAll this time, she had never forgotten that she was a woman. In modern times, this wouldn't matter too much. But in this era, it already took her several years of God-like feats to gain the acknowledgment of these men. She was very much aware that even a single mistake could cause everything she had worked for to come crumbling down.\nLeonel's lip curled as he leaped onto a defensive tower, dodging the sword of a defending knight and kicking him away.\nHe shot forward and down a set of winding stairs.\nCastles were designed with defense in mind. Even something as simple as stairs kept this in mind. They made it difficult to use your dominant hand to wield your weapon and even had irregularly shaped steps that promoted losing your foothold.\nBut, before Leonel's coordination stat, none of it seemed to matter at all.\nIt wasn't long before he made it to the gear room, finding the large chains that held up the drawbridge dangling before him. Unfortunately, he also found something else.\nReimond stood before Leonel with a curious expression, blocking the way to the chains. By his side, there were a group of ten silver armored knights, looking toward Leonel with dull expressions. Three of them wielded longbows, four were spearmen and three were swordsmen.\n\"I thought that something out of expectation would happen today, but I didn't expect it to be this. Who are you two? Where are you from? Have you not considered the reaction of the Bishop?\"\nTo Leonel's back, Aina blocked the constant flow of knights and warriors. Considering how narrow the passageway was, it didn't put any pressure on her at all, but her eyes still narrowed at Reimond's words.\nLeonel surprisingly didn't waste any words, completely out of Reimond's expectations.\nWith one swift motion, he tossed his spear into the air, allowing it to spin.\nHis freed hand pulled out his atlatl and a dart, hooking it as he took a strong step forward.\nLeonel's Force surged, his eyes turning to a bright green glow that caused Reimond's eyes to widen.\n\"You…\"\nReimond's words had barely formed when a violent surge of wind sent his helmet flying. He could only barely see the streak of silver as it cut through the air, its destination the very chains Reimond had thought to protect.\nLike a knife through butter, Leonel's dart sliced through the thick chains. How could the forging of the 1400's match up to a spear created by higher dimensional beings?\nThe sounds of rattling and accelerating chains resounded as the roars of the French continuously became louder.\nLeonel holstered his atlatl and caught his spinning spear before it fell, pointing it toward the group.\n\"Come.\"",

      "content": "Leonel hid his trembling left arm to his side, holding it against his body firmly to make its odd movement less obvious.\nAfter he forcefully stimulated his Force, the Force Chains that had been snaking from the Force Art on his hand took the opportunity to counter. In the end, Leoenl had to forcefully suppress it, but the result was a drain that was even a level higher than it had been in the past.\nAina didn't know it, but Leonel hadn't even been able to sleep in the last several days. If he stopped suppressing it for even a moment, he would suffer. Luckily, he could enter a meditative state that allowed his mind to rest while remaining alert, or else he might not even be able to continue standing now.\nThis was the true reason Leonel so confidently pointed his spear toward Reimond and the others. He wasn't some sort of battle maniac, those words were definitely out of character for him. But he had no choice, he had to do his best to hide his current weakness. And, it seemed like it worked.\nThe pressure that Leonel emitted coupled with the roars of the charging French made the Englishmen to Reimond's back feel that they might really be finished.\nTo one side there was Aina who killed knights descending the narrow winding stairs with a single swing of her ax. Before them there was Leonel whose hair whipped about in a wild manner as his momentum grew. And to their backs, thousands of the French were crossing the no-man's-land they had created toward the castle they were defending.\nEven for Reimond, he really couldn't think of a way out of this. The plan wasn't even a tenth of the way to completion.\nHis calm expression flickered several times, running through a marathon of emotions. In the end, his visage twisted, landing on anger.\nWho were these two? They had planned for so long and so diligently, giving away years of their lives toward this goal. Yet it was going to be finished just like this? How could he be willing?\nAfter a deep breath, he calmed down. Barely a few seconds had passed since Leonel caused the drawbridge to fall. It wasn't over yet, there was still time to turn this around. No, maybe this was an even better outcome for the original plan.\nAt that moment, etchings on the ground Leonel hadn't taken notice of flashed and the group of 11 vanished.\nLeonel's gaze landed on the etchings for only a moment before coming to an understanding. Force Art. A teleportation Force Art. It was no wonder they managed to just appear here before Leonel finished descending the stairs.\n'Is the man with the Force Art ability among them?' Leonel thought to himself.\nLeonel suddenly felt a hand clamp down on his trembling left arm. He looked down to find Aina looking toward him with a mixture of worry and anger on her face.\n\"What are you hiding from me?\"\nLeonel opened his mouth to respond, but he really didn't know what to say. He had only wanted to deal with the chains as quickly as possible. The longer he took, the more Frenchmen would die. But, he hadn't expected the backlash to be so bad.\nLuckily, he didn't have to face Aina's questioning glares any longer because the first group of Frenchmen begun crossing the moat. Leonel took that opportunity to look toward inner gates.\nTaking a deep breath, he could only look toward Aina with a pleading expression as though asking her not to say anymore.\nAina flicked Leonel's arm down in anger and glared at him as though trying to boil him alive with nothing but her eyes. Then, she turned in a huff of rage, her ax lighting up with a violent red glow.\nShe unleashed all her emotions onto the gate, slicing in cleanly in half and kicking its lower portion with a wind screeching stomp.\nThe doors were sent flying, taking with them the lineup of archers that had been waiting on the other side to start another bloody slaughter.\nLeonel's lip twitched. He really had to remember to stop making this woman angry.\nSuddenly, his expression changed.\nLeonel stomped his foot on the ground hard, barreling forward with all his might and appearing to Aina's side.\nHe grabbed her waist, lifting his trembling left arm to block with his quickly expanding shield.\nThe two of them were blasted backward, sliding along the ground on their feet almost to the point of crashing into the French vanguard.\nThe Force Chains had taken advantage of the moment to snake further up Leonel's arm, almost causing him to lose control of it. Had that happened, he didn't even want to think of the consequences.\nLeonel turned a narrowed gaze toward Nigelle, who was slowly lowering his bow from the other side of the inner gates, and then a solemn one toward his now severely dented shield.\nAll this time, no one had been able to land even a single scratch on it. But now it was deformed to the point its shape almost broke his arm. A little bit more and it really could have.\nThat arrow really was too swift and too powerful. Had it not been for his ability improving and causing his senses to reach an unprecedented level, he might have been too late.\nAt that moment, Leonel felt a bundle of raging Force to his side. He looked in shock toward Aina who seemed on the verge of exploding from anger.\n\"Aina!\"\nAina was stunned out of her berserk state. The combination of Leonel's troubles and the near death experience almost made her lose her mind again, but luckily, Leonel caught her at the start this time.\nLeonel looked back toward Nigelle, a deep frown setting into his brow. The situation had changed once more.\nReimond and his ten knights had appeared followed by a female wearing a golden mask appeared with her own knights. Each of the female's knights wore helms that revealed nothing but the slits of their eyes.\nEnglishmen continuously poured in from all sides, forming a defensive line to block entry to the inner gates. It wasn't long before their numbers totaled in the hundreds.\nLeonel's gaze, however, didn't leave the golden masked woman. Though the pole she held in her hand no longer had a flag on it, Leonel wasn't a fool. This woman was obviously Joan.\nThe charging Frenchmen, as though by a previous tacit agreement, slowly organized themselves to Leonel and Aina's backs.\nLeonel reined in the trembling of his left arm. He finally felt he could use his Force again without becoming a puppet to this mysterious person.\nSince Joan was standing firmly on the enemy's side, there really was nothing more to say. Leonel didn't want to spare any words on such a person. He only wanted to ask just what was the purpose of all of this. It didn't seem to make any coherent sense at all.\nWhat was the point of this battle? Why fight on the side of the French at all if her goal was to lose? And at this point, why did she even care to continue to hide her identity?\nLeonel closed his eyes and shook his head, releasing Aina. None of it mattered anymore. Today would be the end of Joan's legend.\n\"Aina.\"\nAina flicked her palm upward, causing a perfectly square plank of wood to appear. She used the same Force technique that helped her levitate her massive ax to allow it to hover in the air.\nLeonel's gaze flashed with seriousness as his spear snaked forward. In the blink of an eye, an intricate rune with soft edges reminiscent to low ocean tides appeared on the wood.\nWith a final strike of Leonel's spear, the plank of wood shot forward through the sliced inner gates.\nAt first, it seemed like nothing would happen. It was just an ordinary piece of wood flying through the air.\nHowever, it was then the temperature began to rise. A moment later, the plank of wood burst into a fire that raced through the lines of the rune. And, in the next instant of time, it collapsed before violently expanding into a fireball just a over a meter in diameter.\nNigelle, Reimond and Joan's eyes widened in horror.",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 200 powerstones. Next at 400 :)]\nThe three of them were shocked and horrified, but Leonel and Aina had already acted once again. In as little as three breaths of time, three more planks of wood were flying toward them, scorching the air.\nFinally, Joan reacted. With a wave of her pole, her knights stepped forward and stomped their feet as one.\nGolden strings sprung from her flagless polearm, attaching to the heads of each of the knights and causing their auras to skyrocket.\nA moment later, a thin and pale gold dome-like shield appeared in the path of the first fireball.\nBANG!\nThe barrier shook and cracked, on the verge of collapse.\nNigelle quickly reacted, pulling his bow string and releasing three arrows that seemed to magically manifest in rapid succession.\nThe embers of the first fireball flashed and sprinkled down from the air, soon becoming a curtain the three energy arrows pierced through to collide with the next three balls of fire.\n\"Let's go.\" Leonel broke out into a run before the six attacks even collided.\n\"80% chance he uses the collision as cover for another energy attack. Shield.\"\nLeonel's ears twitched, barely catching Reimond's words beneath the next cacophony of booms. The latter was practically whispering. If it wasn't for Leonel's sharp sense, he would have really missed it.\n'Precognition? Prediction? Psychic?' Leonel frowned.\nHowever, his steps didn't stop. Judging by the situation, this person seemed to think that Leonel wouldn't be able to hear him. Another thing was that he didn't have a method of communicating without speaking. As long as Leonel could continue applying pressure on him, even if he could guess his most likely course of action, he would only be able to take the optimal actions for himself. In that case, the impact of his ability would be severely limited.\nLeonel's Force surged, pressing down on his left arm with the pressure of a mountain. It would be difficult to win this battle without his Force. However…\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 0.99; Speed: 0.99 (+0.1); Agility: 0.99 (+0.1 - partially nullified); Coordination: 1.15; Stamina: 0.99-1.20 (+0.05 - nullified); Reactions: 1.15; Spirit: 1.00; Force: 0.40]\nLeonel felt that this was enough.\nAina cut past Leonel, swinging her massive shimmering ax down and causing a beam of Force to split the explosion in half.\nLeonel took the opportunity of the pause in her steps to flash by her once more, jumping through the opening she created.\nSeeing this, Reimond smiled, believing he had successfully predicted Leonel's attack pattern. However, he soon realized that he had miscalculated.\nSeemingly having expected the new barrier in his wake, Leonel took appropriate action.\n'The movement of Joan's knights are based on her ability. However, as expected, the movements of Reimond's are more autonomous. They exist for the sole purpose of protecting him, and any combination abilities they have should rely on Force Arts.'\n\"Aina.\"\nAina was already following closely behind. Hearing Leonel's voice, she flung forward another plank of wood.\n'Force Arts can create, but they can also destroy.'\nIf he could use his Force, this barrier would be nothing to him, especially since it had already blocked a percentage of Aina's energy scythe. However, he wasn't certain that his bodily strength alone could pull it off. Luckily, it didn't have to.\nLeonel's eyes rapidly shifted from side to side, taking in everything about the barrier he was still leaping toward. His ability churned at full tilt, calculating madly without end.\nIn the next instant, a familiar square plank of wood appeared before him and his spear snaked forward once again without hesitation.\n'Undo…'\nThere were many disciplines under the Force Art umbrella. In fact, it was even a bit foolish to consider them a single whole.\nAmong these disciplines, there were a few greatly respected. Those that followed this discipline were known as Decriptionists. They had the ability to deconstruct any Force Art and see through their flaws. Those of this profession were invaluable in high level Zones and when exploring the graves of high-grade Dimensional Masters.\nOf course, Leonel wasn't such a person. It was just that he happened to realize that Force Art was simply a method of making Force flow in a certain manner. Specific frequencies and conditions allow the manifestation of different phenomena.\nBut in that case, couldn't those frequencies be countered?\nIt was a simple thought that Leonel had tested in the last few days. Even he wasn't aware of just how unfathomable the path he had stepped onto was, nor was Reimond aware that he would be the first to suffer under his discovery.\nIn a muffled bang, the defensive barrier formed by Reimond's knights collapsed like a house of cards, allowing Leonel and Aina to charge through.\nBefore the first knight could react, Leonel's spear shot forward with an unbelievable speed and pierced his throat. He pulled it back and passed by before the first spurt of blood even made itself known.\nNigelle cocked back another arrow, but before it made it to Leonel, Aina had already stepped forward. With a swing of her ax, the arrow shattered like glass.\nWithout missing a beat, Leonel's spear became like a blur, causing another three knights to fall mercilessly. No matter how much armor they wore, he was able to find the tiniest crevices and the smallest openings to exploit, reaping their lives with a single strike every time.\nJoan couldn't sit idly by. With another wave of her polearm, her knights moved forward once more.\nLeonel had thought that they would be just as easy to deal with as Reimond's knights. However, he soon found that even after several probes, both his and Aina were still trapped in their encirclement.\nEvery time Leonel thought he saw an opportunity to strike one of them down, another would strike toward him at an angle he had no choice but to retreat from. After this happened several times, Leonel's expression grew solemn.\n'They share their senses…'\nLeonel's brow furrowed. He hadn't expected their momentum to be stifled so suddenly.\n'The only way to break through in a short time is… absolute power.'\nLeonel's gaze narrowed and he shot forward. Others might think that the only method of displaying absolute power was strength. But Leonel knew of another: speed.\n\"90% chance he tries to brute force his way through.\"\nReimond's voice once again traveled to Leonel's ear. His words were incredibly soft and he believed that only Joan could hear him, but the reality wasn't so.\nJoan waved her polearm once again, causing her knights to bunch together in preparation for a strong attack.\nUnfortunately, though Reimond's prediction was correct, he failed to describe the method Leonel would use.\nLeonel firmly planted a leg, suddenly changing directions and shooting through a gap between a knight and the inner gate. Joan's actions had only made them all the more susceptible to his maneuver.\n'[Call of the Wind].'\nThe instant Leonel flashed through, a faint glow coated the tip of his spear.\nReimond's last thought was one filled with shock. He, who could do the work of God and prophecy the future… died just like this?\nA bloody hole seeped with blood from his forehead even as a sweep of Aina's ax sent Joan's knights tumbling back several steps.\nLeonel clenched his jaw, the veins on his left hand bulging like swarming green snakes beneath his dented shield. He had gotten rid of the most dangerous of the three of them, but he had paid a severe price.\nHe couldn't move his left arm.",

      "content": "\"Reimond!\" Nigelle's almost hysterical cry fell after time seemed to stop for a moment.\nBlinded by rage, he unleashed arrow after arrow toward Leonel. In his anger, his arrows violently expanded, becoming roaring flood dragons that snaked through the skies.\nLeonel didn't foolishly meet these strikes head-on. Clearly, Nigelle had forgotten about the overall situation when he attacked, lost in his emotions just now.\nWith swift movements, Leonel took several winding steps, dodging the powerful arrows with ease. Another person wouldn't be able to dodge the attacks such a great archer had launched from now even 30 meters away, but Leonel was different. He wasn't judging the trajectories of the arrows while they were in the air, he had already calculated where they would land the instant Nigelle released his bowstring.\nThe moment Leonel passed by the dragonic rain of arrows, a chorus of muffled booms and cries of pain sounded. He didn't need to look back to know that Nigelle's rash actions had affected Joan's men, even taking out two of them.\nLeonel chose to trust Aina. If he could quickly take out a second one of them, then the two could focus on taking down Joan without worries. At this point, the normal soldiers hadn't even dared to try and take part in a battle of this caliber. So, Leonel felt that he could directly ignore them, at least for now.\nUnfortunately, while he was on a tear toward Nigelle, the remnants of Reimond's knights stepped forward, their gazes red as they swung their weapons toward him. It was clear that they too cared for the man deeply.\nThere was a part of Leonel's heart that felt guilt. However, he could only push it down. He had already resolved himself to be part of this new world order. Killing and being the root cause of the pain of others was something he couldn't avoid. As long as he had a clear conscience toward his actions, he would continue to move forward.\nLeonel's gaze grew firm, holding his left arm as tightly against his body as he could, his spear snaked forward once more. Though he didn't use his Force, the power and speed behind his strikes wasn't something these normal human men could deal with. He was too fast, too agile, too strong.\nHis gaze flickered toward the distance and toward Nigelle's paling visage. It was clear that that last attack had taken a lot out of him.\nThe sound of spurting blood was almost akin to the gushing water of a pressurized hose. In the blink of an eye, Leonel had taken down three more, using the opening it created to shoot off toward Nigelle.\nJoan obviously didn't want such a thing to happen, but she didn't dare have her men turn their backs toward Aina who was currently holding eight of them back all on her own. The main issue was that as an archer, Nigelle had to be at a distance and was far from them from the very beginning. With them taking the vanguard and blocking the way, they had never considered the fact that he could ever be in danger.\n\"Form up!\" Nigelle roared.\nRegardless, there were still hundreds of Englishmen between Leonel and him. This was more than enough to allow him to recover. He realized he had been too rash just now, even being the reason two of Joan's eight knights had fallen, a number that would have been greater if not for Joan's action, even more of them would have been wiped out.\nThe Englishmen shook in fear at this command. It was clearly just throwing away their lives to get involved in a war between gods, but they didn't dare disobey. What would happen to them if they enraged this god?\nLeonel's brow furrowed, if he really had to go through so many, not only would it defeat the purpose of why he chose to involve himself so early on, it would also give that archer far too much time.\nHis gaze flickered as he noticed a piece of the inner gate Aina had blasted apart with a kick earlier.\nWithout hesitation, he flicked the piece upward with a kick before snaking his spear forward in a familiar motion and allowing the broken piece of wood to fly forward and into the defensive line of Englishmen.\nThe English knights screamed out in terror and dodged to the sides, not daring to meet this attack head-on. Many even closed their eyes and fell to their knees in prayer, knowing they didn't have enough time to move out of the way.\nBy the time those knights realized that something was wrong, a strong wind had blown by them and Leonel had already left them behind.\nNigelle watched on in shock. Even when Leonel had appeared upon his archery tower and sliced his head from his neck, the grievance was clear in his eyes. He had really died due to such a petty trick.\nIt was simply impossible for Leonel to draw a Force Art so quickly. Force Arts needed a steady hand and precise movements. It was impossible to draw one on a plank of wood that was kicked up into the air. However, Leonel didn't need to. He just needed the English to believe he could.\nLeonel didn't pause for even a moment. Taking advantage of the wooden tower he stood in, he shot his spear downward and quickly etched out several Force Arts.\nHe didn't wait before jumping down, the tower behind him combusting into a meteoric rain of fire that forced the English to run in all directions. They didn't even have the chance to believe that maybe Leonel couldn't create those heaven defying fireballs any longer before he directly cut off that line of thought.\n'I'm reaching my limit.' Leonel thought, his jaw clenched tightly as he took advantage of the situation to rush back toward Aina.\nDrawing Force Art needed Force too. It was just that the amount was minuscule comparatively speaking, if your control was good, that is. With his obscenely high spirit stat, practically no one in the same range of abilities had better Force control than Leonel. This was why he could still draw them despite the situation of his left arm.\nHowever, even if it was a small amount, it was still an amount. If he tapped into his reserves anymore, he wouldn't have the strength he needed to suppress the chains any longer.\nLeonel didn't realize at this moment that the most dangerous of them hadn't been Reimond at all.",

      "content": "Leonel quickly scanned the situation ahead and sighed a breath of relief when he saw that Aina was fine. In fact, she was more than just fine, she had taken out four more of Joan's knights, leaving just four remaining. But it seemed that Joan's control had grown tighter with less to worry about, causing the difficulty to actually become somewhat more difficult.\n'Good, I'll take her out now and it'll all be over.'\nLeonel suppressed his fatigue and dashed forward under a rain of balls of fire. He could practically see the end of this several month-long affair.\nHe bore down on Joan, his gaze meeting hers across tens of meters. Reimond's knights once more tried to block his path, but the last of them fell with a sweep of his spear. They hadn't even hit the ground when Leonel had already appeared several meters to their backs.\nJoan's gaze was hard to read. Despite having not taken his eyes off of her, Leonel couldn't tell if she was calm or feeling complex. Her blue eyes, hidden beneath her golden mask, seemed to ripple slightly before going still every so often.\nIn truth, it seemed like she was finished. She couldn't pull her knights back from Aina, or else it would be that bloody ax that took her life. At the same time, she had always been on the back line, having no combat prowess of her own. That moment Leonel took Reimond's life, she knew that she wouldn't have had the ability to resist had his target been her.\n20 meters. 10 meters. 5 meters.\nLeonel brandished his spear, settling his scorching lungs as he pierced forward with everything he had.\nHe didn't waste words on her. The time for that had long since left them.\nIt was at that moment Leonel heard something akin to a sigh. And it came from Joan herself…\n\"Rise.\"\nA string of gold separated from Joan's polearm and entered Reimond's corpse which lay to her side, causing him to suddenly stand and accept Leonel's blow to the chest.\nWith a clang, Leonel's spear rebounded off of his chest plate, causing a strong reverb to travel up his arm.\nIt was only a moment, but Joan had already shot backward and raised her polearm high, a string of corpses that were the product of Leonel and AIna's efforts appearing in along her path.\nA low shout left Joan's lips and the few golden threads from her polearm became several hundred. Not only did it shoot into the crowd of scattered Englishmen, but it also tore its way through the gates and dove into the defensive line of Frenchmen as well.\nLeonel had just wanted to sigh a breath of relief. Joan wasn't a Necromancer, she didn't really make Reimond rise back from the dead, she only took control of his limbs and used him as a human shield. But, judging but the thickness of the line of gold she needed to do it, he deduced that it took more effort than controlling the living so it was no wonder she hadn't used this ability in the past.\nHowever, his happiness was short lived. He had thought that Joan was limited in her ability to control others, but he never thought that she would suddenly take control of hundreds of knights like this.\n'No, I can't let her create space.' Leonel shot a gaze toward Aina, but she was still struggling with the remaining four knights. Having no other choice, he could only press forward with all his might on his own.\n'Dammit, I really should have taken her out first.'\nIt really wasn't Leonel's fault. He had followed Joan for months, but all she ever did was give out stat boosts and she never did so to more than ten knights at once. On top of that, she never took control of them like she was doing now. He failed to consider that while he was hiding his own strength, she was doing so as well.\nIf one had a choice between a man who could read into the future, and a frail woman who could seemingly only control ten knights… It was clear what most would decide.\nNow however, he was paying a price for it.\nLeonel felt a bit of agitation in his heart. He was obviously much faster than Joan, but he kept having his path cut off by corpses and Englishmen who had come to give away their lives. At the same time, he knew that the French were most definitely charging toward Aina. It was to the point he didn't dare to look back because he feared he wouldn't be able to control his urge to turn back and help her.\nLeonel holstered his spear to his back once more and pulled out his atlatl. Usually it wouldn't be a problem for him to nock a dart with one hand, but he was being swarmed from all sides, making the process awkward. To make matters worse, because he had a useless left arm, he had to act quickly or else he wouldn't be able to defend himself at all.\nHe barely managed to succeed, but when he looked back up, the shimmering reflective surfaces of several swords, pikes and spears were headed in his direction.\nWithout a choice, Leonel grit his teeth and dropped his atlatl, pulling his spear back out from his back to swat these weapons aside.\nLeonel could feel Joan getting further and further away. To make matters worse, Aina's aura was starting to become erratic, if this continued, she might go berserk again.\nIf he had known this would happen, he would have let Aina use her breakthrough into the Seventh Node to shatter that Force Art that had them trapped. By then, she could stabilize her Force and not have to worry about it. But now, there simply wasn't a dense enough source of Force here to help her.\nThe more Leonel thought, the greater the agitation in his heart grew and the more uncontrolled his spear became. It wasn't just his thoughts, it was his fatigue. How could his control remain the same when his legs felt like they had been filled with lead and his arms felt so boneless?\n'Calm down Leonel. Breathe. Think. How do you get us out of this?'\nPersistence didn't just mean when convenient. It was even more important exactly when everything seemed hopeless.",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 400 powerstones. Next at 600 :)]\nIn this case, the situation truly did seem hopeless. There were more and more knights swarming to block for Joan, it seemed that Aina might lose control again, and Leonel himself felt that he was approaching his limits.\nHis body was heavy, his Force was languid, and his left arm felt as though it was being poked through by thousands of needles.\nHowever, even with this being the case, Leonel managed to calm his heart. He had almost lost his life more times than he cared to count within the Mayan Temple. It was always his mind and not his power that helped him out of those situations.\nHe had been too rash this time. If he hadn't been constantly trying to brute force his way through this battle, he wouldn't have ended up in this state so quickly. Of course, it was also possible that Reimond and Nigelle would still be alive in such a situation, but Leonel still felt that he could have taken a smarter, better approach.\nIn the end, he kept making mistakes because he simply didn't know enough. Had he known how easy it was to break through that Force Art prison, he would have never drawn this thing on his hand. Had he known Joan had such abilities, he would have killed her first before Reimond.\nBut, there was no longer any use in griping over such things. Being agitated would get him nowhere. In fact, he might make more mistakes as a result of such a mindset.\nLeonel warded another forward movement of the Englishmen, his pale green eyes locking onto Joan who was still continuously increasing her distance from him. In fact, if it wasn't for her bright golden armor, he would have already lost her in the sea of bodies already.\n'Fear tactics won't work any longer, they're being controlled. Think… think…'\nLeonel didn't stop moving forward. He seemed just as frantic as he was in the beginning, causing Joan to have no choice but to continuously respond with more knights. He had no choice. If he stopped moving forward, then it would be too easy to surround him.\n'… If it was possible for her to just take control of all the French like this, why had she bothered to appear here in the first place? If she took control of the French from the very beginning while they were charging through the gates, Aina and I would have been caught completely off guard.\n'Even further than that, why is it that she insisted on wearing a mask if controlling the French was so easy? No, even more importantly, why is it that…'\nLeonel's gaze grew brighter and brighter.\n\"Aina! Knock their helmets off!\"\nLeonel's roar shook the battlefield. The moment his words fell, Joan's eyes widened. It looked like she wanted to say something, but it was already too late. Due to her retreat, she was already so far from her knights to begin with. And, even if she was close, she simply had no ability to stop Aina from doing something so simple.\nLeonel had finally realized something. When he saw that the line of gold that took control of Reimond's corpse was thicker, he had mistakenly believed that it was more difficult for Joan to take control of the dead. However, this wasn't the case. The reason the line of gold was thicker was due to Joan using a buff to increase the defensive abilities of Reimond's corpse at the same time.\nBack then, Leonel had been too agitated to think of it. It was true that Reimond wore knight's armor, but Leonel had long since established that the forging of this era couldn't compare to the weapons in his hand. So, how could it be possible that his spear would rebound like that if it wasn't for Joan's interference?\nIf he calculated the amount of force his spear could apply and the amount of force that would be needed to counter him like that, then the actual amount of Force Joan needed to take control of the corpse was less than 10% what she needed to control a living being.\nWhat did this ultimately mean? It meant that it was more difficult to control the living than the dead.\nAfter this point, Leonel no longer had solid evidence and could only make his own guesses. It was a desperate situation, so he could only try and see what stuck. But, he felt that it was logical to conclude that the reason it would be more difficult to control the living was because they would be fighting against that control.\nIf this was accepted, then why is it that Joan would cover her face? Why is it that she would cover the heads of her knights such that only their eyes could be seen?\nAina's ax swept forward, barely clipping the edge of a helm worn by Joan's knight as he dodged backward.\nA sparkling gold shot into the skies, spinning above the battlefield before slowly descending to the ground.\nWhat was revealed was something Leonel could barely see from his vantage point. But, the French who had surrounded Aina under Joan's control saw it all clearly.\nIt was a young man they all recognized. He had tears streaming down his face and veins bulging across his forehead. It was clear that he was trying his very best to hold himself back from swinging his sword down again, but try as he might, nothing was working.\nThey all recognized this young man. He was a bit naive, a bit foolish, and even a bit annoying, but he held a place in all their hearts.\nHe was Michael.\nIt was then that Leonel fully understood. The reason why Joan's knights had become even stronger after some of them died was because they had become easier to control. All this time, she had been fighting against their wills.\nAs for why Joan chose to continue using living people instead of corpses, Leonel finally had an answer as well. It must have been far more difficult for her to buff corpses, or else why would that line of gold have been so thick? In the end, the trade off wasn't worth it.\nSeeing Michael's face, the Frenchmen started struggling even harder. They had already not wanted to attack Leonel's sister. However, in the end, while they liked Leonel, as a mute, they didn't have much of an impression of Aina. This was why Joan only controlled them to take her down instead of attacking Leonel who was far more favored.\nHowever, she could have never imagined that Leonel would grasp her weakness at such a critical point.\nLeonel wanted to immediately take advantage of this turn in the situation. Who knew if Joan had a method of retaking control of them. But, what he found when he looked back toward her shocked him.\nBlood was leaking from the eye slits of Joan's mask. Her polearm, which had been raised into the air, was the only support holding her up. Leonel could even faintly see that the fair hand she had used to grip it had become old and wrinkled.\nA moment later, she fell to the ground. With his senses, Leonel didn't need to get closer to know what had happened.\nJoan of Arc. Jeanne d'Arc. Was dead.",

      "content": "Leonel stood in a daze.\nJust like that? It ended just like that?\nThere was still a swarm of English to his front. With his current condition, he wasn't confident in even defeating them, let alone cutting a path through and taking down Joan.\nLeonel suddenly felt a cold shiver, causing him to quickly spin toward the source. However, he found nothing but more Englishmen and further back, a swarm of French knights.\nHis brow tightly furrowed, but no matter how he swept his Internal Sight, he couldn't find anything wrong.\nUnable to find anything, he turned back, slowly walking to Joan's body.\nBy now, the English didn't dare to block his path. Their commanders were dead, and now the god on their side was also dead, how could they dare to continue to fight back? Even with Leonel being heavily injured, they just witnessed him say something seemingly ridiculous, only for that to end in the death of someone they thought was invincible.\nThey had no idea what thought process Leonel used. All they knew was that his strength was unfathomable.\nLeonel used his good arm to flip Joan over, slowly removing her mask. Looking at the sight before him, he couldn't help but feel complicated.\nThe once beautiful Joan had become an old, wrinkled woman. She died with her eyes open, their bright blue having faded into a milky grey-white. However, Leonel was certain that this was indeed Joan.\nLeonel picked up her golden polearm. It had once proudly held the French flag, but now it was barren and lonely. Even the faint golden light it once emitted was now gone, leaving behind a seemingly ordinary staff.\nHowever, it was this very staff that caused the English to retreat several steps, worried that they would lose control over their bodies once again. Seeing such a scene, Leonel knew that this was truly over.\nParis had been conquered. In a flash of light, Aina and Leonel disappeared.\nJean silently watched this happen, a curious light in his eyes behind the slits of his helmet. No matter what, it most definitely didn't look like the eyes of a man who had just lost the love of his life. They pair of shining pupils almost looked amused.\n\"A failure, huh…\"\n**\nWhen Leonel's vision cleared, he once again found himself in a familiar white space. But, to his disappointment, he didn't find Aina by his side. Maybe he had gotten a bit too attached having had her there all the time for the last several months.\nAt least he was in a better state than the last time he came here. He felt it was a bit nostalgic, not that there was anything good to reminisce about when it came to a near death experience and especially the excruciating pain of having his hip shattered.\nLeonel rubbed his nose, smiling lightly. Anyway, he would see her again soon after he left this place.\nWhen he thought to this point, he laughed to himself. If James was here, he would definitely be calling him a lovestruck fool.\n'Wait… This is my left hand.'\nLeonel blinked, realizing that he had used his left to rub his nose just now since his right was still holding onto Joan's polearm. He quickly tried to look at the Force Art on the back of his hand.\nLeonel grinned when he realized the Force Art's core was shattered.\n'As expected, the higher the Dimension, the higher the requirements for the Force Art to function is. This Force Art was incredibly strong in the Third Dimension, but this white space must at least be of the true Fourth Dimension if the core shattered like this.'\nAlmost as soon as he thought this, Leonel felt a swirling power surging toward him.\n'Oh no, is my hair going to fall off again…?'\nUsing Force, it was easy to stimulate the regrowth of his hair, but he wasn't some sort of magician, at least not yet. His hair was still much shorter than it had been in the past , though it was growing faster than it normally would.\n\"Looks like you've done something crazy again, kid?\"\nLeonel, who had quickly sat up and crossed his legs in meditation, heard this voice drift into his ears.\n\"Uncle Montez? What's happening exactly?\"\n\"Your previous breakthrough was interrupted due to lack of energy. Normally when that happens, it's fine as you can just slowly accumulate more. However, the formation of the third, sixth and ninth Nodes are all watershed moments no matter which technique you use, it was inadvisable to break through in a Zone like that unless its a Zone of higher grade than your current Dimensional Constitution.\n\"You're lucky your Force control is so great, or else you would have likely self imploded by now.\"\nThough Leonel's eyes were still closed, he felt a cold sweat mat his back. Why does it feel like every mistake he makes causes him to face death? Why can't he be a normal teen and wield his immaturity with impunity?\nMontez, still in his golden armor, brought out a scroll once more, seemingly not caring about Leonel's current state. However soon, his lazy expression changed and began to twitch.\n\"Idiot!\"\nLeonel, who was trying to meditate, felt a palm slap his forehead. He could even feel the blood rush toward the area as it began to swell.\n\"What the hell —\"\nAnother palm slapped Leonel's forehead before he could finish.\n\"You dare use such language in front of your uncle?\"\nLeonel's lip twitched. He called Montez uncle because it was polite, it wasn't as though he had any real familial relationship with him. Why was he getting beaten now? Didn't this man know that if he lost concentration, something could go wrong? By then, maybe his luck would run out and he'd really explode.\n\"I already told you last time, but you don't listen. First you enter a four person Zone by yourself, now you enter an eight person Zone with just one another? What are you thinking?!\"\nLeonel felt incomparably aggrieved.\n\"What are you talking about? We had a device with 90% accuracy for Zones at the S-grade. It said only two could enter.\"\n\"What sort of snake oil device are you talking about?! Even a Tier 1 Black Grade detection device would be able to accurately decipher how many could enter a Zone, it's the easiest calculation to complete. It's impossible for it to be wrong.\"\nLeonel's lip twitched again. He seemed to remember that his wrist watch had indeed told him that the person limit was eight, but he ignored it because he trusted Aina. He didn't even know what to say right now.\n'Why would she lie about that…?'",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 600 powerstones. Next at 800 :)]\nLeonel was still in a bit of a daze, but he didn't have much time to think about it. He could feel that his Star was still madly consuming Force.\nWhat Leonel had failed to consider was that the formation of his One Star Cleansed body was directly proportional to the size of his Force Nodes. A normal Force Node for one building a Fourth Dimensional Constitution is a single cell up to maybe three. An above average person to a genius would use upward of ten. Of course, these numbers are for worlds in the process of evolving into the Fourth Dimension, youths birthed into higher Dimensional worlds obviously have greater standards.\nYet, even by the lofty standards of those use, Leonel's 100 cell Force Nodes were obscene. As a result, his One Star Cleansed body was likewise levels beyond others who reached this step.\nBy this point, Leonel's high spirit wasn't just a plus, it was a necessity. Only with such high Force control could he possibly allow such a grand Star Cleansed Body to be formed. Not only that, but his ability would likewise evolve even faster under the benefits.\n'He's awakened his Lineage Factor already, and so thoroughly at that.' Montez blinked, no longer disturbing Leonel. 'At least this time, he won't waste so much of his time like he did previously. That's good.'\nThe truth was that the rewards for completing Zones were only one aspect. Another piece of the reward was the chance to practice in this space. Unfortunately, last time, Leonel was practically half dead, so Montez spent too much time healing him.\nThis time, though there was a smaller allocation, at the very least, he could benefit a bit.\nA few hours later, Leonel finally opened his eyes. For a moment, it felt that he could destroy the earth with a single stomp.\nOf course, he knew that his power wasn't so exaggerated, but it was a great feeling nonetheless.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 1.00; Speed: 1.00 (+0.1 - nullified); Agility: 1.00 (+0.1 - nullified); Coordination: 1.40; Stamina: 1.20 (+0.05 - nullified); Reactions: 1.40; Spirit: 1.00; Force: 0.40]\nNow, Leonel had completely broken through the shackles of the Third Dimension, something that greatly shocked him. He had thought this wouldn't be possible until he completed the formation of his ninth Force Node. Was this the strength of a Star Cleansed Body?\nThe gap between 0.99 and 1.00 was a sturdy bottleneck. Before, it was only possible to cross in his weaker stats when he activated his Force. But now, even without it, he could do so. He would be even more powerful if he did activate his Force.\nUnfortunately, he was bald again. Not only that, but that foul smell was several times worse than the first time around.\n\"You stink.\"\nLeonel's lip twitched. What was with all the people in his life always insulting him like this. He knew, alright? But what could he do about it? It's not like it was his fault.\nAfter thinking this far, Leonel made up his mind. He definitely wanted combat-wear like Aina's. Not only were those pockets way too useful, but apparently he'd be insulted left and right until he had that self-cleaning function.\nSuddenly, Leonel looked up and grinned. \"You'll let me use that pool to bathe again, right? Uncle Montez?\"\nIn exchange for his cheekiness, Leonel received another palm to the forehead before Montez waved his hand in the air, as though trying to get rid of the stench that latched onto him.\n\"You have no idea how valuable that pool was. Usually, you could only enter as an exchange for a Tier 9 Black reward. I can be considered to have made a one time exception since you didn't get a fourth of the World Spirit like you should have.\"\nLeonel's eyes widened with understanding, seemingly remembering that he had been cheated out of a great reward.\n\"Alright, this time you and the little girl definitely did something great. But, don't trust that device you used again. Any device that can make such a ridiculous mistake should be burned in the fires of hell along with its maker.\"\nLeonel smiled bitterly and scratched his head, not responding. He didn't want to hear Montez rip Aina a new one, so he kept the fact she must have lied to himself.\n\"Alright, you cleared a Tier 7 Black Zone made for eight, so that warrants a minimum reward of eight Tier 7 Black rewards.\"\n\"Wait, it wasn't a Unique Zone?\"\nMontez frowned at this question, but after double checking his scroll, he looked like he had come to understand something. Leonel even thought he saw a faint wisp of worry on his face.\n\"No. According to this, it was very close to evolving into one, but didn't in the end. Whatever anomaly it was chose not to act in the end or couldn't act for whatever reason, so it remained a normal Zone.\"\n\"Anomaly…?\"\nMontez took a deep breath and sighed. \"Toss this out from your mind. Just consider yourself lucky, this time.\"\nLeonel wanted to ask more, but seemingly realizing that Montez wouldn't tell him anything, he could only silence himself.\n'Anomaly… didn't act…? Was that related to the cold feeling I had after Joan died…?' Leonel's brows furrowed.\n\"… I assume you and your partner will split these rewards in half. Aside from this, you completed two side quests, one worth another Tier 7 Black reward and one worth a Tier 8 Black reward. The hidden quest this time is worth a Quasi Tier 1 Bronze reward.\n\"In addition, you are the first to perfectly clear a Tier 7 Black Zone and this is worth a Tier 9 reward.\"\n\"We don't need to split these too?\" Leonel asked. \"Then why did I only get one set of rewards for my side and hidden quests the first time…?\"\nLeonel felt a bit cheated.\n\"That's just the way things work.\" Montez shrugged. \"It's like this to stop high Dimensional warriors from farming low level Zones too much. It's not a perfect solution, but it's not a bad one either.\"\n\"… Sounds to me like you're all a bit stingy… Can't they farm anyway if they just bring some people along with them…?\"\nMontez coughed and pretended not to hear Leonel.\n\"Anyway, make your choices. You have five Tier 7, one Tier 8, and one Tier 9 Black reward. In addition to one Quasi Tier 1 Bronze reward.\"",

      "content": "Soon after Montez's words fell, the long magical counter appeared once more. It seemed to stretch to the left and right endlessly.\nLeonel's first instinct was to get the best Zone Analysis Device he could. The price for lacking information was simply too steep. Just a single mistake could result in a failure. If such a thing happened, his life would be over.\n\"… Uncle Montez, are there… Escape treasures?\"\nLeonel suddenly thought of something. From what he had seen, it seemed it was impossible to find a device with 100% accuracy. At the same time, he didn't believe that the only remaining path in case of a mistake really was death.\nHearing these words, Montez grinned.\n\"Of course. However, they're all one time use items. In addition, they also only work for one person at a time. So, unless your whole team has one, you'll be branded as a Deserter and hunted by your world.\"\nSaying these words, Montez's gaze flashed with a cold light. It seemed he wasn't new to such people.\n\"Aside from this, escape treasures are limited by their strength as well. A Tier 7 Black escape treasure can only escape Zones below Tier 8, for example.\"\nAfter a while, Leonel hesitated again.\nHe didn't know the truth behind his dad's past, but what he did know was that he knew more than he had told him to this point. Leonel believed in his father. Since even he could tell how important Zone Analysis Devices were, his father wouldn't leave him hanging, right?\n'That old man told me he left something in the basement for me. If it's not a Zone Analysis Device, the next time I see him, I won't acknowledge him as my dad anymore.'\nLeonel silently harrumphed in his mind, clearly still somewhat unsatisfied with his father's abrupt departure.\nLeonel sighed. \"What do you suggest, Uncle Montez?\"\nHe could only ask this question again. Though he knew what he wanted to some extent, he wasn't sure which tier of treasure he should allocate to which. In the end, he was lacking in too much fundamental knowledge. If it wasn't for his ability, he probably wouldn't have lucked into such a good Force cultivation method.\nMontez stroked his chin, apparently trying to appear like a wizened elder. But, he was lacking in the beard department.\n\"Which of your Lineage Factors did you awaken?\"\n\"Which?\" Leonel frowned at the wording.\nMontez coughed. \"I mean what is your Lineage Factor?\"\nHearing this question, Leonel suddenly remembered that both he and Aina couldn't really figure his Lineage Factor out. Maybe this was a good chance.\n\"I was meaning to ask you a question about that. My Lineage Factor is a bit weird. It seems to only activate when I wield a spear. It's very subtle in its effects, but I feel that it has great poten …\"\nLeonel's voice trailed off. Well, it wasn't that it trailed off, but rather that Montez's boisterous laughter completely drowned out his words. No matter how Leonel thought about it, he couldn't understand what was so funny about what he had just said.\n\"That bastard's probably rolling in his grave right now, HAHA! Wait, he's not dead yet, HAHA! He'll definitely pull his hair out when he finds out, HAHA!\"\n\"… Um… Uncle Montez?\"\nMontez seemed to have finally realized that Leonel was here with him, but it still took him several moments to stop laughing and wipe the tears from his face. In fact, there was a point where he grabbed Leonel's wrist without a care for the grime covering him and burst into another fit of laughter.\n\"Is there something wrong?\" Leonel asked worriedly. \"Usually Lineage Factors are boosts to speed or strength, right? Why's mine related to a weapon?\"\nMontez waved his hand. \"Those are low level Lineage Factors. Forget it, it doesn't matter much. I'll help you out.\"\n\"Should I pick a good spear?\" Leonel asked.\n\"No.\" Montez smiled, but didn't explain his words. \"A spear is the last thing you need. Soon, you'll have more than you know what to do with. Just keep the one on your back for now.\"\nLeonel's expression only became weirder. But he had given up on asking questions. Montez clearly wanted to torture him, whether it be by his palm or with curiosity.\n\"Instead, there's something better. Here.\"\nMontez clapped his hands and the counter quickly shrunk once again. The items left only made Leonel more confused.\nThere were five items in total, all of which fell under the Tier 7 Black grade.\nThe first two were lumps of what looked like unrefined ore. They had a silverish grey hue to them, but sometimes looked like clumps of coal when the light hit them just right.\nThe third item was a pair of black gloves. They seemed plain at first glance, but upon closer inspection, there were complex vein patterns running all across it. However, they were barely noticeable due to the fact they were black as well, albeit of a vaguely deeper shade.\nThe fourth item was a quill. It was quite a beautiful pen with a silvery and flexible tip. The feather attached to its back was a pure white and had faint fluctuations of wind around it. Leonel didn't know what beast this feather was from, but he was certain it had an ability related to wind.\nHowever, even among all these odd, seemingly disjointed items, the last was even a level weirder. It was… a glob of liquid metal?\nAt first, Leonel thought it was just a silvery metallic ball. But then it became a puddle of goo. And yet after that, it became a small mountain range.\nIt kept flickering between its forms like a fickle child, painting all sorts of extraordinary scenes. Though, it still followed the law of conservation of mass. It never became something beyond itself and was kept confined within a small space.\nThe object itself was so odd that it wasn't until it became a simple silver cube that Leonel realized it had actually been encased in a glass cube. Now, it was just spreading itself to conform to its container as though looking for a way out.\nWhen it failed, it slumped back down into a puddle, its surface burping with bubbles as though sobbing.\nSeeing its personified actions and almost human-like emotions, Leonel's heart felt a slight pang. He felt bad for the little guy.",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 800 powerstones. Please don't reach 1000, *cries*]\n\"What… What is all of this?\" Leonel finally said, prying his eyes away from the blob of silver.\n\"Those are ores. These are gloves. This is a quill. And this is liquid metal.\"\nSeeing Montez's smug grin, Leonel felt the sudden urge to hit the man for the first time. He had eyes, he could obviously see these things. What he wanted to know was what their purpose was and why Montez would tell him to use his rewards on them. From what Leonel could see, these things weren't helpful to him at all.\nMontez seemed to have not seen Leonel's glare. However, he displayed a surprised look when Leonel actually nodded and pulled the five items to his side, signaling that he had accepted.\nMontez's mouth opened to say something, but he held back in the end. He felt even more stifled now than Leonel had. How could he continue to make fun of this kid if he acted like this.\n'He a good kid, but it seems even he has a temper, huh? Almost as annoying as…'\nLeonel gave up asking Montez questions. He knew that there was probably a good reason for why he couldn't tell him more. It was best to just focus on the good these rewards would bring him rather than anything else. He still had a Tier 8 and 9 Black treasure to pick, and a Quasi Tier 1 Bronze reward as well.\n'I already had [Call of the Wind] to help my long distance attacks. But, even though I modified it to help my spearmanship, it would probably be better to have a real spear technique. Right now I'm relying too much on instinct but don't have any real idea how to wield this thing.'\nLeonel thought back to how he had just randomly picked up this spear from a gang of humans and smiled wryly. It could be said that he stumbled into this Lineage Factor of his.\nHowever, the truth was that Leonel was far more interested in his own ability. The potential Dream World had was inconceivable. If taken to its logical extreme, there might even come a day where he could simulate Zones and not even need a device to do it for him.\nOf course, that was still too far from him now. As things stood currently, his accuracy was barely above 70% for matters between the Third and Fourth Dimensions. If he tried to simulate Black Zones, which were instances of the Fourth Dimension influencing the Third, his accuracy wouldn't even be 50%.\nThere was another matter as well. Using Dream World was a great drain on his spirit even for something as focused as forming a Force Node. He couldn't even imagine the drain of attempting to simulate several months worth of events.\n'I don't have enough information. I don't think Zone Analysis Devices simulate months worth of events either. There's definitely a simpler way, I just don't know what it is…'\nLeonel shook his head. He was wasting his time thinking about matters too far beyond him. He still had to remember that there was a time limit.\n\"What do you think, Uncle Montez? I need a spear technique, but I'm not sure if I should use my Quasi Tier 1 Bronze reward on it or not.\"\nMontez shook his head. \"I don't suggest you pick a spear technique at all. You aren't even aware of the basics. In addition, if you add more information before you're ready, it will influence your ability to sense your Lineage Factor before it has matured.\"\nLeonel smiled bitterly. Didn't that mean he had made a mistake again? He had already technically learned such a technique. Should he stop using it?\n\"Then is there a method among the rewards that can help me learn about my Lineage Factor? Or maybe strengthen it like [Dimensional Cleanse] could my ability?\"\nMontez shook his head again. \"Lineage Factors are tailored to specific families. The methods to learn and strengthen them are kept close by said families. If your Lineage Factor is the result of the future influencing the past, you can only muddle through on your own.\"\nLeonel was speechless. And here he thought that the future influencing the past was a great thing. But it seemed that those with great backing still had an advantage.\nTaking a deep breath, he settled himself down.\n\"I would like to see all the full bodysuits you have at the reward levels I'm looking for. They must have a self-cleaning function. I also want to see everything you have that can draw Force Arts. And lastly, I want to see everything that can help my movement speed.\"\nLeonel was very much aware that his greatest weakness was still his speed. It had managed to catch up, but this was only under the influence of his One Star Cleansed Body. He wasn't certain if the effects would continue. In addition, having trump cards to escape dangerous situations didn't sound so bad.\nWith a clap of Montez's hands, the counter expanded once more. Leonel's gaze was filled with all sorts of bodysuits or various shapes and sizes, in addition to an assortment of shoes, talismans, and even… temporary tattoos?\n\"As for the treasures that can write Force Arts…\" Montez grinned mysteriously. \"… That quill I gave you is more than enough.\"\nLeonel's brows raised, but didn't say much more.\n\"Then instead of that, I want a treasure that makes things more convenient to carry. Aina gave me this belt that shrinks things… But I'm kind of embarrassed to keep relying on her like this.\"\n\"Hohoho, Aina is it?\" Montez gave Leonel a lewd grin.\nLeonel ignored Montez who soon clapped his hands once more causing the long display table to expand once more.\nIn the end, Leonel chose his three items.\nWith his Tier 8 Black reward, he picked out a bland, black bracelet. He was shocked to find that it had a small space in it about two cubic meters in size. If he lay his spear diagonally within it, it wouldn't be a problem to put it in. Though, Leonel didn't plan on doing this.\nWith his Tier 9 Black reward, he chose another pair of shoes that could disguise themselves as sneakers.\nThis was when Leonel found out some unfortunate news. No treasures beneath the Bronze tier could increase his stats after they reached 1.00. So, he couldn't find something that increased his speed any longer. However, he felt that this reward was even more useful.\nThese shoes could produce a platform to jump off of! All Leonel had to do was circulate some Force into them and time them to activate after he leapt into the air, then he could proceed to do a 'double' or even 'triple jump'.\nThe only unfortunate part was that they had a one minute cool down, so Leonel could at most walk two steps across the air. But, it would be useful nonetheless. Had he had these shoes against Joan, she wouldn't have been able to run from him so easily.\nFinally, with his Quasi Tier 1 Bronze reward, he chose a silver chain necklace with numerous small runes etched onto it. It had the ability to produce a transparent, pale blue membrane. This membrane could fuse with his clothing, making them more difficult to tear, increase his defense, and it had a self-cleaning function as well, making it perfect.",

      "content": "After he completed his selections, Leonel turned a pair of pitiful pale green eyes toward Montez and finally got the right to use the pond again to clean himself. Unfortunately, though, it seemed his stats weren't influenced by it at all.\n'Have the effects of dad's vomit brews ended so quickly?'\nLeonel frowned. He found it hard to believe that this was the case. He downed those brews for 17 years without missing a single day. If he did the math of the sheer volume he had digested, he would feel a hard to ignore urge to gag.\nAfter a moment, Leonel could only toss these thoughts to the back of his mind. His father never told him exactly what those vomit brews were for. For all he knew, the stat boosting effect was just a side product while its true purpose was more hidden.\n'Maybe I'll find out more after I make it back home… Should I bring Aina to the Empire's gathering place first? Or should I take her home with me?'\nLeonel wasn't a fool. Although he knew some truths behind how sinister the choices of the Empire had been, he also knew that trying to break free from them now would only mean death.\nIf technology was really going extinct, he might have chosen to sever ties now. However, the wrist watch proved that the Empire still had some hidden methods. Plus, who knew how many more families like Aina's there were and how many of them had sworn allegiance?\nFor now, Leonel had no choice but to swallow some grievances.\nThere was another possibility as well. Uncle Montez had mentioned that he could buy a ticket to another world in exchange for a Tier 9 Black reward. If worse came to worst, Leonel would look into this method.\nLeonel shook his head and left the pool, feeling refreshed.\nNow that he could finally see his skin again, he realized that it had become softer and more elastic, not to mention the fact he couldn't see his pores no matter how hard he stared. It was like he just came from his mother's womb.\nIt was a good feeling that left him smiling to himself.\nAfter a bit, he had put his clothes back on. The shocking part, though, was that the rips in his sweat pants were completely healed. They looked like a new pair he was wearing for the first time.\nLeonel realized then that this was an ability of his silver chain necklace. Not only could it make his clothes harder to tear, but it could repair tears that already occurred as well. He finally didn't have to walk around like a beggar anymore.\nSliding on his tight fitting compression shirt reward he had received from his first Zone, Leonel grinned.\nThough he could put his metal box of darts in his bracelet, he chose to keep it by his side with the help of AIna's belt. It was more convenient this way.\n\"Uncle Montez, how much time do I have left?\"\n\"Mm, since it was a TIer 7, you have about a day left I guess.\"\n\"Good.\"\nLeonel's gaze sharpened. There was something he really wanted to do, and it could only be done here.\nWith a thought from his Internal Sight, Joan's golden polearm appeared in Leonel's hand. Leonel felt it was a bit unfortunate he hadn't had the time to take Nigelle's bow as well, but it couldn't be helped.\nMontez swept a glance at the polearm, but he didn't remind Leonel that it wouldn't be able to be taken out of here. He was sure that Leonel knew of this already, or else he wouldn't be wasting his time studying it.\nAs expected, Leonel's ability had grown once again.\nAfter forming his First Node, he grasped Dream World. This ability helped him to form his Second and Third Nodes with ease. After a few more days, forming his Fourth and even Fifth wouldn't be a problem at all. In fact, Leonel could tell that the time frame had shortened thanks to the Star formed in his mind.\nLeonel's new ability couldn't be considered completely separate from Dream World. At most it was an extension. Leonel even had the faint feeling that most of his newly comprehended abilities would be like this. But, he didn't mind at all.\nHe called this new ability Dream Sculpting.\nDream Sculpting, making use of Leonel's ample spirit, could scan and create a replica of an object in Leonel's mind. It had to be said that Leonel's spirit was directly proportional to his Internal Sight. So, Leonel was essentially constructing a model of an object and building a copy of it in his mind.\nObviously, it was impossible to use this copy. It was simply an image in his memories. However, this memory had many uses.\nFor one, it was more robust than his other memories. Observing this memory would be no different from observing the true object. And, secondly, if this memory was pulled into his Dream World, he could use his simulation abilities to test out several things.\nHowever, this was the true beauty of Dream Sculpting.\nNormally, Leonel's simulations have barely above 70% accuracy. However, if coupled with Dream Sculpting, under the condition that all the tests are solely related to the sculpted object, the simulations he could run would exceed 99% accuracy!\nThere was only one bottleneck for this ability, and that was the object itself. Depending on the object's grade, it could be harder or easier to Dream Sculpt it. And, Joan's polearm just happened to be quite difficult.\nIt took Leonel over 23 hours to succeed. And by the end of it, he felt like all the energy in his body was drained. He even felt that his ability had gone dormant without any spirit to fuel it.\nLuckily, he still had enough time to replenish himself by entering the pool once more. He came out with a massive grin on his face. Though he didn't know if the polearm's Dream Sculpt would be useful in the future, at least he had a proof of concept for now.\nLeonel bid farewell to Montez with a satisfied smile on his face, happy to get the chance to see Aina again.\nA light blinded Leonel for a moment, and when he could see again, his mood sank. He had almost forgotten the sorry state the world was in. Collapsed buildings and cracked sidewalks were still littered all around him.\nHowever, his mood brightened again when he saw Aina's silhouette not far from him. But soon, even that was ruined.\n\"Another one, huh?\" A male voice cut off Leonel's thoughts.\nHe had a bad habit of ignoring everyone else when he laid eyes on Aina, so he hadn't even noticed that there were three others here.\n\"The two of you are under arrest. This was designated as the region of an S-grade Zone. The two of you have entered without registration and without permission. Please do not resist, or you will only make this harder on yourselves.\n\"Place all of your contraband into this black bin and allow yourselves to be taken in. Your belongings will be confiscated to the proper authorities.\"\nLeonel's smile faded, leaving an expressionless visage as his gaze met the equally dull expressions of the three military men.",

      "content": "Though Leonel was expressionless, his mind was spinning. Should he acquiesce? He was obviously unwilling to give up things he spent his blood and sweat on, but how could his current self match up against a monstrous existence like the Ascension Empire?\nLeonel was a kind hearted person, but a pushover was something he wasn't. In a world controlled by nobles like those who frequented his Royal Blue Academy, those without spines were eaten up and spat out with impunity. The fact Leonel was so well-liked and admired, even despite his entertainment profession, made it obvious he wasn't such a person.\nIn addition to this, Leonel wasn't a fool. He knew that those who could clear an S-grade Zone were not many, so the treasures he had on hand now were most definitely rarities amidst rarities. Just hand them over? Was that some sort of joke?\nOf course, these thoughts were just his immaturity seeping through. He knew it wasn't smart to have such thoughts without proper backing. The true reason he felt that he shouldn't do this was because it just might be possible that he did have such backing. He didn't know what his father was involved in, but regardless, he was certain he wasn't easily dealt with. At least not by these common, everyday government officials.\n\"You're here.\" Aina made her way to Leonel's side somewhat subconsciously. It almost seemed like she hadn't heard the words of the three officials.\nLeonel smiled lightly, before turning his attention back toward the three men.\n\"According to the laws of the Ascension Empire, I have the right to ask for your proof of identity as well as your rank and station.\"\nWith Leonel's ability, coming to a quick and logical decision to no more than the blink of an eye.\n\"Are you resisting arrest?\"\nLeonel inwardly sneered. He knew that those in positions of power never liked to be questioned. Even if it was the law, they'd find an excuse to not answer his question not because they couldn't, but because they found it humiliating to do so. There was no shortage of those like this in enforcement positions.\nYou would think that with their Gene Analysis tests, the Empire would be able to weed these people out from such professions. But it seemed not.\n\"Resisting arrest? Sir, to be frank, you three aren't a match for the two of us. You said yourself that this is an S-grade Zone region. You should also have information that this Zone was constructed for the entry of eight, yet do you see anyone else other than the two of us?\"\nLeonel sent a glance toward Aina, but she seemed to have not heard his words, looking off into space blankly. This reaction made him feel a bit stifled. It was like that time she killed Conrad all over again. He couldn't read her.\nHowever, as expected, the three men stiffened as though just realizing this. It seemed that many still hadn't adjusted to the new world order quite yet. They were too used to normal citizens having no means to protect themselves.\nLeonel could obviously see their stats. Even the strongest among them only had their highest stat barely reach 0.70. Of course, Leonel didn't foolishly think that this was enough to defeat them. It was unknown what abilities they had. In addition, if the Empire really kept tight control on technology now, then it was likely their guard dogs held some of this power as well.\nIf these guards had guns on them, even Leonel would be at a loss. Firearms from the 1400's already gave him a huge headache, he definitely didn't dare take them head-on. Firearms from this day and age were a completely different animal. He wouldn't even know how he died if he dared to go up against them.\nThe more Leonel thought about it, the more certain he became. If he was as sinister as the Emperor, using the Metamorphosis to eradicate all instances of technology while keeping the only functioning machines with himself would be the perfect plan to hold onto power…\nLeonel grew even more serious.\n\"As you can see, Sirs, if we wanted to resist, we could have already. So, will you answer my questions, or not?\"\nDespite his apprehensions, Leonel could only continue forward.\n\"… I am Tier 3 Officer Farlier, assigned to Perimeter 3 of the Royal Blue Fort task unit.\"\nLeonel remained expressionless, but he inwardly sighed a breath of relief. As long as he had this initiative, it wasn't a problem.\nA Tier 3 Officer had the same standing as a Tier 3 Government Official. Leonel's father had been a Tier 5 Government Official. Though, that wasn't very helpful now considering he was already 18 years old.\nSuch an Officer could be considered a step away from an elite. At the same time, he was at the very top of officials who dealt with normal civilian matters. Meaning, he had high standing, but when facing potential noble scions like Leonel and Aina, he had no choice but to be cautious.\nOf course, it helped that Leonel and Aina were so calm.\n\"A Tier 3 Officer can make decisions about an S-grade Zone?\"\nLeonel raised an eyebrow, immediately catching onto a problem. There should be very few who would even dare to enter such a Zone, let alone succeed in clearing it. This was by definition something that could only be handled by elites. In that case, how could a Tier 3 Official make decisions about it?\nThe Officer's face reddened slightly, but he hid it well beneath his deadpan expression. It was just unfortunate for him that Leonel's senses were too sharp.\n\"I don't mind if you escort us to someone who can make such a decision.\" Leonel's voice became like the officer's saving grace. \"However, giving you my treasures is impossible. We didn't enter this Zone to disobey the orders of the Empire, we did so because if no one cleared it, we would have been mobbed to exhaustion by Invalids who were swarming toward it.\n\"I'm sure you, as a Tier 3 Officer, know of the Ascension Steele's First Amendment, right?\"\nThe three officers looked at one another, bitterness clear in their gazes.\nThe Ascension Steele was not much unlike the fallen American Empire's Constitution. No matter the state of the Empire, even if it was under martial law, the Ascension Steele's words held the highest precedence.\nThe First Amendment was known as the Right to Autonomy. It was an all encompassing law that allowed the disregard of other Amendments as long as there was sufficient cause.\nAs one might imagine, such a vague law made it so that those with power got away with far more than they should while those without were out of luck.\nHowever, in this case, Leonel and Aina really did have such power. It didn't matter if they falsely regarded his ability as a D-grade one, the facts showed that he had the ability to clear an S-grade Zone. At least for now, it was impossible to disregard this.\n\"… Come with us.\" Officer Ferlier finally said.\nWith that, they led Leonel and Aina to a large black jeep with three rows of seats.\n'A natural gas vehicle? With wheels at that…? So they're relying on such old technology to keep their hold on power, huh…?'\nLeonel's eyes narrowed, but he didn't struggle and got into the car. His next move would all depend on how the rest of the day went…\nHe looked out of the tinted windows, watching the sun slowly set in the distance.",

The reason why the Academy had this name in the first place was due to its proximity to the Royal Blue River which directly fed into the World Sea. In fact, they weren't far from the coast even now.\nEarth, in this age, only had one large ocean body — though, this ocean body had numerous separating currents and the like.\nAfter unifying the world, the Empire made amazing technological advances, eventually unlocking terraforming abilities that not only helped colonize the Moon and Mars, but also control the shift of tectonic plates.\nThe current Earth was not unlike Pangaea of the past. As a result, there was just one ocean.\n'I wonder if there is just one universe… Is it Earth that's evolving to the Fourth Dimension? Or is it our universe? Or maybe it's on a smaller scale like our solar system?'\nLeonel's brow furrowed and he tossed this to the back of his mind, He simply didn't have enough information.\nIf only Earth was evolving, that meant their colonies would be left behind. If not… The Empire would have many more variables to contend with.\nThis aside, the Royal Blue Fort was the fortified government building of the Royal Blue Province. There were a total of nine Provinces, and unsurprisingly, in terms of economic output and the overall wellbeing of its people, the Royal Blue Province was also ranked third just like Royal Blue Academy was.\nHowever, whether that would continue to be true from now on was unknown. As a flourishing Province, Royal Blue Province had many industries, but among them, real estate had an exceptionally great place here. This was precisely due to its location near the coast.\nParadise Islands that had orbits that passed over the ocean were highly sought after. Those who were poor saw Paradise Islands as prisons that kept them from the surface, but for the rich and powerful, it was a good way to get away for a few days and even seen as a great vacation spot.\nWith such an important source of income gone now, it was obvious that Royal Blue Province would likely be on a downward trend from now on.\nHowever, this also represented opportunity.\nThe nine Provinces were ruled by nine Governor Dukes. Obviously, the Governor Duke of Royal Blue Province, Governor Duke Leum of the Leum family, wouldn't want to see his power wane and thus might be more willing to let a few things slide…\nAlong the way, it wasn't rare to come across Invalids. However, the jeep was clearly built for these situations as a high level armored vehicle.\nWith the S-grade Zone gone, this was no longer a hotbed of powerful Invalids. The various F to C-grade Invalids they ran across were easily mowed over or outrun.\nSuch a situation made Leonel all the more serious. Without this jeep, he and Aina could just as easily deal with these Invalids, but the Officer driving it most definitely could not. This was the advantage technology gave.\nThe more Leonel saw such a situation, the more certain he was that acting rashly just because he had a little bit of power now was a foolish thing to do.\nIn Leonel's hands, a cube with a bouncing blob of silver could still be found. When he had wanted to put it into his spatial bracelet, Montez gave him another palm to the forehead, saying that living organisms with strong Life Force couldn't be placed into such things.\n'… So you're living, huh? I wonder what you are…' Leonel observed the little blob of silver performing tricks as though to cure itself of boredom.\nAina sent a curious glance over, but it seemed she was also unaware of what the blob was. And, since she had ignored Leonel's implied question earlier, she felt it would be a bit too shameless to ask about it. So, the two sat silently at the back of the jeep.\nSoon, a looming wall of steel that stretched 20 meters into the sky appeared, causing Leonel's eyes to narrow. He had seen this government building before, but it most definitely didn't have such walls in the past.\nAfter a complex series of protocols and bypassing the gates, the jeep slowly rolled into the Fort.\nRoyal Blue Fort was like another world. Unlike the wreckage on the outside, it was organized, clean, and even had clear hallmarks of diligent city planning. If one knew nothing about what was going on outside, it would be easy to believe that this was just another day…\nThe only clear difference here was that technology had regressed. With a quick glance, Leonel could tell that other than the street lamps that illuminated the dimming light of dusk, those who frequented the streets didn't have personal tech of their own.\nThe buildings were mostly residential apartments separated into street blocks. In addition, there seemed to be one grocery store and an entertainment center per street block, but there weren't many people using them. This could have either been due to a curfew, or maybe they weren't so simple to use. Leonel felt it was likely a combination of the two.\nIt didn't take long for the jeep to reach the core of the Fort. Since the Fort itself had a diameter of barely ten kilometers, it wasn't very large.\nThe engine cut and the sounds of opening doors made Leonel take a deep breath. Steeling himself and calming his heart, he took a step out, an aura of authority exuding from his body.\nAina smiled lightly but didn't say anything. She knew that Leonel wasn't trying to pressure anyone on purpose by doing this, he just had a habit of taking even the smallest things incredibly seriously, let alone something that likely involved his life and death.\nHowever, his actions caused the three officers who brought them here to break out into a cold sweat. At this point, they were no different from the students of Class A who suffered Leonel's torment all these years.\nAt that moment, they felt like Leonel was a wild beast that might swallow them at any time. Even the imposing walls of the Governor Duke's mansion felt like they had shrunk several folds.\n\"Leo!\"\nSuddenly, Leonel's suffocating aura vanished as a familiar figure appeared from the large, towering double doors of the mansion.\nLeonel blinked before smiling lightly.\n\"James.\"\nThe name had hardly come out before he was engulfed by a bear hug.",

      "content": "James' boisterous laughter filled the night sky.\n\"You dog.\" James punched Leonel's shoulder. \"You actually disappeared for half a month with my sister-in-law, since when were you two moving so fast?\"\nLeonel laughed and shook his head. It seemed that James was still the same old James.\n\"We had to save your ass. Who asked you to be so useless.\" Leonel rebutted.\nJames stumbled backward, putting a hand to his chest as though he had truly been hurt.\nLeonel's banter with James was light hearted and fun, but it made the officer's break out into another cold sweat barely moments after surviving through their first bout.\nThough they didn't know who Leonel was, they definitely knew who James was.\nBeneath the Governor Duke's family, there were several other supporting families of great, albeit lower, standing. James' Bennett family was one of these forces, or how else could he be coming out from the Governor Duke's mansion?\nThe truth was that this place looked like a mansion from the outside, but it was more accurately described as an estate or maybe even a castle. It looked like one massive home, but the inside was separated into the living residences of several prestigious families.\nIn normal times, with how arrogant these families were, it was simply impossible for them to share space like this. Unfortunately, due to the apocalypse, space was limited. So, though they could live in better luxury than the normal citizens within the walls, they still had to bunch up as well.\nThat said, it wasn't as though they were suffering.\nJames finding Leonel here was actually just a pure coincidence. The towering double doors of the mansion were perpetually open. After all, it was just the entrance to an inner city of sorts and no one dared casually offend so many nobles.\nHe had been tasked with receiving some prisoners. Obviously, with their low standing, these officers had no right to enter the inner city. Since it was an easy method to gain some easy contributions, he had come. He had just never expected that the so-called prisoners would actually be his best friend and his 'sister-in-law'.\n\"… This is ridiculous, don't even worry about it.\" James said with a casual wave of his hand. \"I don't know what you did wrong, but I assume it has something to do with entering a Zone without first registering. But, considering the timing, you entered during the grace period.\"\nHearing these words, Leonel's sighed a breath of relief. He really would rather not fall out with the Empire so quickly. He didn't have the means of dealing with them, even if he wouldn't be chased with the full brunt of their power. Plus, Earth was his home. He would rather not escape to some unknown world.\nJames ignored the officers and led Leonel and Aina up the wide stairs and toward the looming double doors.\nIt should have been no different from crossing another threshold, but Leonel felt that upon stepping through the doors that he had just passed a misty rain. He blinked in shock, only to find that the scene before him was completely different from what he had seen from the outside.\nIt was like he had gone back in time to the day he left for school. Royal Blue City was back and the Paradise Islands hadn't fallen.\nHowever, Leonel knew that this couldn't have been true. At best, this was a small replica of the once luxurious city. But what still remained unchanged was the fact that unlike the outside, this place had no restrictions on technology at all.\n'How…' Leonel's brows furrowed. 'Spatial abilities? This place seems bigger on the inside than it was on the outside… There's even a sky here. What's going on? No, it's impossible for an ability to have such a large scale already… right?'\n\"Cool, isn't it?\" James grinned as he looked toward Aina and Leonel. It was rare that he could be aware of something these two Class A students weren't.\n\"Governor Duke's eldest son is managing this place while his father was recalled to the capital. Well, all Tier 6 officials and above were recalled. They want to clear out the Ascension Province and restore its peak glory as quickly as possible, so not to mention Tier 6 and above officials, even those monsters with S-grade abilities and above were recalled as well.\n\"However, they didn't leave us without any protection at all. The Junior Governor Duke also has an S-grade ability. He calls it Illusion Mist. From the outside, this Fort only seems to be ten kilometers in diameter, but the truth is that it's almost double that with most of the space being taken up by this hidden city.\"\n\"An S-grade ability, huh..\" Leonel muttered.\nThe scope and power of an S-grade ability left Leonel feeling cold. To hide such a city right beneath the eyes of so many, and for him, even with his sensory abilities, to not even notice. He wouldn't be able to handle such a person in battle even if all of this Junior Governor Duke's stats were 0.10.\nThis was exactly why Leonel hadn't rashly attacked those Tier 3 Officers. Not only was he worried about their technology, he was also worried about what abilities they might have. Even if his stats destroyed them in all areas, what could he do against an overpowered ability?\nIt was the same as that metal bodied A-grade Invalid he had killed. Leonel's stats had still been better than it at the time, but its ability made it frighteningly difficult to kill.\nStill, even with all of this being the case, Leonel remained calm. His ability didn't have such outstanding immediate effects, but he believed that its potential was no less frightening. If given enough time, his future prospects were unfathomable.\nLeonel wasn't an ambitious person. He didn't have lofty goals or a hunger for power. Sometimes, he believed that it was precisely due to this disposition of his that the Gene Analysis results slotted him the way that it had.\nHowever, Leonel was also maturing slowly. Currently, he had no goals or aspirations, but that was only because he hadn't decided what he wanted to do with his life yet. He was just like any other normal 18 year old, wandering a bit aimlessly.\nThat said, there were two things Leonel did know. For one, he wanted to help Aina. And two… He didn't like the methods of the Ascension Empire. In fact, they sickened him.\nIf this was the case, he only had one task: grow stronger.\nJames' lip twitched when he felt his best friend start emitting that scary aura again. He had grown a bit used to it, but it still made his knees weak.\nHe knew that Leonel had a slumbering beast hidden inside him that only lifted its head every so often. If there came a day Leonel met something that let him completely release that beast…\n'… If you weren't so soft, you would truly be a monster.'\n\"Come on. I was supposed to bring you to Tier 5 Admiral Millan. I was confused before, but you guys probably did something big, huh? It's fine, my dad doesn't fear that old guy. It should be easy to smooth things over. Plus, talent is exactly what we need right now.\"",

Though the escort of Leonel and Aina seemed lax, the truth was that this simply represented confidence.\nFrom what Leonel could tell, there was something about the Metamorphosis and especially Zones that destroyed technology. He was only lucky that his bike didn't use electricity to fold and unfold itself, or it too would have stopped working.\nHowever, outside of Zones, the Empire had managed to keep their hold on technology. With such a reality being before Leonel right now… Was it even possible to escape?\nTier 5 Admiral Millan would have likely come to find them after they were thrown into a cell, but James completely ignored this and instead brought them directly to the military holdings.\nThe Admiral position was especially important in a coastal Province like theirs. Due to the vastness of the World Sea, it provided many opportunities for rebels. As a result, Admirals and their navies played a key role in dealing with these uprisings.\nThough rebels were no longer the primary problem they faced, the dangers that lay in the oceans were likely even fiercer, now. Who ever said that humans were the only ones who could awaken abilities during this Metamorphosis?\n\"Admiral Millan! I've brought the prisoners.\" James' tone bordered on sarcasm. Who told this old fart to try and arrest his best friend?\nJames knocked on a solid oak door and brazenly raised his voice.\nThe offices of the high level government and military officials were located in a place similar to a city hall. There were tall ceilings leading to curving glass windows, numerous thick pillars, and spacious floorings of expensive, high-class marble.\nTier 5 Admiral Millan's office was located on the upper floors as per usual. A golden inscribed nameplate was nailed to the center of the door.\nHis secretary had been outside and was meant to field all visitors, but who would have expected James' actions to be so overbearing? Leonel couldn't help but smile bitterly.\nHe had a feeling that James was going all out to help him now as a repayment for the National Championship game. It made his heart feel a bit warm.\nSoon, a short man of barely 5'4\" opened the door. Though he wasn't very tall, he had a strong, stocky appearance and broad shoulders. His hair was slightly greying and he had the most perfectly groomed beard Leonel had ever seen.\nHe might have had a small stature, but his air of command was undeniable. In addition, as an Admiral, what was the most important was his mind and strategic abilities, not his personal combat prowess.\n\"You brought prisoners here? The mission should have made it clear for you to escort them to the prison. What do you think you're doing?\"\nAdmiral Millan's voice was deep and rumbling. It made Leonel feel like his very bones were vibrating beneath its waves.\n'Is his ability related to his voice?... It must be…'\n\"You think I would let my friend and my sister-in-law rot away in a cell while you play your petty mind games with them?\" James asked. \"Plus, I have information on their crimes. They entered the Zone during the grace period. They had no choice or we would have been swarmed by Invalids.\"\nHearing these words, Admiral Millan's visage darkened further. How could he not know these things? Since they had sensed the energy waves of the Zone, they obviously knew when it appeared and when it had been entered. However, this was a rare opportunity to take advantage of a few kids that seemed to have power but no backing to speak of.\nHe had planned to soften them up by letting them stay in a cell for a few days and maybe weeks, then play the role of savior to get them out. Then he might be able to get them to seek shelter beneath his wings and become the vassals of his Millan family. But who knew that this would happen?\nThis was an S-grade Zone they were talking about! One meant for eight! Yet it was cleared by two people. The fact that these two hadn't been recalled to the capital was a miracle.\nThough his standing wasn't the highest, it was still fairly high. He was aware that it was possible for talents to fall through the cracks. Reason being these talents would come from poorer families, as a result, the wrist watches they were given at birth wouldn't be high-level and thus fail to accurately judge their talent.\nThis was a guess Leonel had already made long ago, a guess he was even more certain of after seeing how flourishing this hidden city was. With how important accurate information was within Zones, they were essentially playing with the lives of their citizens…\nBut none of this mattered anymore. With James' interference, even if he didn't personally hold any power, the influence he had would be enough to expose MIllan's machinations.\nDespite the whirlwind of emotions going through his mind, Admiral Millan was still a veteran who had seen death and war. His adaptability and his mind were what few could compare to.\n\"Alright.\" He said simply. \"Since a member of the Bennett family can vouch for them, this will make the process simpler. The treasures gained during the grace period, under the decree of His Majesty, can be kept by the two of you. However, they need to be properly registered, along with their abilities and names.\n\"In addition, from now on, the rewards you gain from Zones will first and foremost be considered the property of the Empire. You will gain Ascension Points in return which you can use to buy them back. Of course, since they were earned by your efforts, should you choose to buy them back, you will receive a discount…\"\nLeonel sighed inwardly as he listened to all of these rules and regulations. Ultimately, what the Empire cared the most about was control. They wanted a record of every treasure that appeared on Earth, and judging by how many times Admiral Millan's gaze had swept curiously across the cube in his hand, the matter wasn't only as simple as this either.\n\"… As for the rest, I'll allow James to explain it. This is an era of danger, but also opportunity. It isn't impossible for you two to climb up.\"\nAdmiral Millan's words seemed laced in a deep meaning, but Leonel only smiled respectfully, thanking the Admiral before following James toward registration.\n'This registration process is likely so that the Empire can catch talents that might fall through the cracks due to their own scheming… In that case, it might not be a bad thing if they can't see through the potential of my ability…'\nLeonel's thoughts were simple.\nIn a Zone, who could tell what happened? Weren't the wrist watch on his hand and the team who followed him in the only things that could?\nThe second problem was easily solved. He only had to enter with those he trusted. As for the first, it was a bit more complex.\nIf his registration went well, the Empire would set his sights on him. They would give him a higher level wrist watch that would be able to more accurately read Zones. In that case, it would be nearly impossible for him to hide the rewards he received.\nHowever, if he was deemed as unworthy of such effort, he would be allowed to keep this lower level device. For context, this was the same device that assigned the Mayan Tomb an F-grade in the beginning. What if the Empire thought he was only receiving F-grade rewards when in reality he was receiving C-grade or even higher treasures?\nThe benefits of this could be imagined. He could bide his time and slowly build his power.\nUnfortunately… Reality was cruel.\n[*Beep*]\n[Subject: Aina Brazinger]\n[Ability: *Name Unassigned*]\n[Ability Type: Healing]\n[Ability Grade: Error.

My best friend and sister-in-law are two of those Variant ability monsters! We'll see who dares to bully me now!\"\nHe seemed to have completely missed how gloomy Leonel's current expression was.",

      "content": "In the end, Leonel could only sigh. He couldn't have imagined that instead of making an incorrect guess, the scanners of this city hall would actually slot them into the Variant category. This could be considered to be even worse than Leonel's worst case scenario.\nAccording to James, Variants were individuals with abilities rated above the S-grade. There weren't accurate enough devices to measure them, so they could only be lumped together. However, most importantly, all of these individuals had spotlights trained onto them.\nOf those who survived the initial stage of the Metamorphosis, there were a few dozen who achieved this hidden grade of sorts. This number couldn't be considered large, but it wasn't small either.\nSince the grade was so vague, there were obviously differences in strength between those who had this Variant title, but those differences were often not obvious, at least at the start. Earth was still in its infant stages, what would happen in the future was still difficult to decipher.\nLeonel stepped out from the sphere Faraday cage-like device. It was constructed by numerous separate pieces of circular metals, attached to each other at two points and spread apart until they formed a ball shape large enough for ten humans to enter at once.\nThe moment he did, he felt like he wasn't a human who had stepped out from a steel ball, but rather a hamster who had fallen from his hamster wheel.\nThe feeling of being the center of attention wasn't something Leonel was unused to. If it wasn't for this catastrophic event, he would probably have tens of millions of fans watching him play football every week. But this was still a weird feeling.\nThe weirdest gazes came from those wearing what looked like lab coats, the symbol of Royal Blue Province's most prestigious research lab — Blue Pearl Research and Labs — embroidered onto their lapels. They looked no different from ravenous beasts looking toward a piece of fresh meat.\nTo scientists like them, the Metamorphosis was like a gift to a child on Christmas. Which of them didn't want to uncover the truths behind these mysterious occurrences? Humans might not have many redeeming qualities, but one thing they were was curious — and they felt an insatiable need to cure themselves of this curiosity.\nThe opportunity to study two Variants brought was simply unimaginable. How could they not be excited?\nAt that moment, the scientists who had all already swarmed Aina, split into a river of two and engulfed Leonel, who they had previously ignored, as well.\n\"Leonel Morales is it? To think you would be a Variant as well! Please allow me to track your brain waves for a single month. I'll give you ten Ascension Points a day in return!\"\n\"Don't listen to this old codger. Listen, listen. I only want you to wear this micro camera so that I can monitor and record your fights. You don't have to wear it all the time, only when you head out for missions. I'll give you five Ascension Points a day in return!\"\n\"These old fools only know how to fight amongst themselves! You're a sensory type, right?! You're perfect for my research. Unlike these idiots who seem to believe you can only be the lab ra — I mean honorable test subject for one of us at a time, I have no issue sharing you. I only hope to meet with you once a week for help on a device I'm working on…\"\nThe chorus of white lab coat wearing maniacs made Leonel's lip twitch. Even Aina seemed bashful about all this. Her cheeks had a slight tint of red to them and she looked toward the ground to avoid their gazes. Such a scene made Leonel want to rush forward to protect her.\n\"You psychotic nerds! Don't you have any self-respect?!\"\nUnfortunately, James' words completely fell on deaf ears. The scientists didn't bother with him even one bit.\nAt that moment, the basement floor of the fort's city hall received some more guests. The ding of a large elevator's descent could be heard before its thick steel doors slowly open to reveal several middle-aged men and women wearing serious expressions.\nTheir gazes swept over the underground lab to land on both Aina and Leonel who were both being swarmed.\nAmongst them, Leonel easily picked out Tier 5 Admiral Millan. This time, his relaxed, but stern, expression had a bit of dark tint to it. Clearly, he knew how great the opportunity he had missed was now that Leonel and Aina were Variants. However, he also knew that this would have been exposed eventually, and his family wasn't qualified to hoard such talents to themselves.\nThe one in the lead of them, however, was a woman with wide hips wearing a tight knee length skirt. Her hair was pinned up in a neat bun and her delicate features were hardly hidden behind the frames of her glasses.\nMuch like her skirt, her blouse clung tightly to her curves, seemingly barely holding back the towering mounds on her chest. However, that view was partially obscured by the clipboard she held to it.\nNo matter how you looked at it, she was just a secretary. In fact, the identification tag hanging from her waist made this guess all the more obvious.\nThough she was an outstanding beauty, a beauty not losing out to Joan no matter how one looked at it, she still shouldn't have been qualified to lead this small group of Tier 5 officials.\n\"Two great talents have joined our Royal Blue Fort, this is great.\"\nThe secretary smiled lightly, her visage lighting up the whole room. She curiously observed Aina before turning her gaze toward Leonel, but she was surprised to find that the young man was only curiously gazing at her as well.\nBy her estimations, an 18 year old boy, at this moment, should be doing his very best to stop the next current of drool from falling from his lips. How could he so calmly meet her gaze? Did he maybe… not see women in that way?\nThough she thought this, as a woman with her level of standing, it was impossible for one to be able to read her emotions from her expression.\n\"Ah, look at me, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Maia, Royal Blue Province's Secretary Marquisette. I can be considered to be the personal aid of young Junior Governor Duke, so I apologize on his behalf for not being here. However, he is currently in the process of clearing an A-grade Zone as we speak.\"\nA sudden flash of understanding overcame Leonel. Secretary Marquisette… That was a Tier 6 official position. Even Governor Dukes were just a single level higher. It was no wonder they were all so respectful to this woman.\nLeonel had never expected the Secretary Marquisette to be so young. He also realized now that the reason he thought she was a normal secretary was because from his vantage point, he could only see a part of the tag on her hip.\n\"I see, it's nice to meet you. I am Leonel Morales.\" Leonel smiled politely.\nAina gave a polite greeting of her own, but she seemed to have gone back to her quiet, stoic self. Leonel really couldn't understand how she flipped through emotions so quickly. One moment she was yelling at him, the next telling him he stunk, the next she was blushing, and the next she was a brick wall.\nWomen really were the bane of men.\n\"Since the formalities are out of the way, we should get to the important stuff. I'm sorry to tell you that until the Capital sends a proper response, the two of you won't be allowed to enter any Zones. This procedure will take at least a few months with the state the Ascension Province is in currently.\"",

He looked like that innocent boy who tricked Joan and her knights for all those months.\nThere were two reasons the Capital would try to stall for time like this.\nOne is that they wanted to slow his growth. Powerful beings were good for the benefit of Earth, but their existences would be difficult to control after enough time passed. Earth's current technology could probably put Leonel in a grave right now without much issue, but whether or not that would still be true in a year or more was still unknown.\nThe second reason was less sinister. It was possible that it really would take this long for the two of them to be accommodated for. It was definitely not easy to build those devices.\nLeonel had no ability to deal with the wrist watch on his hand currently. Even now, he couldn't even damage it, let alone take it off. If this was considered low level, who knew how much more was put into those high level ones? Leonel couldn't imagine.\nThere was still one other reason Leonel didn't flip out though, aside from the fact it would be stupid to do so. Even if he couldn't enter the Zones… it didn't mean he didn't have other methods to grow.\n\"Does that mean we'll have to sit idly for those months?\" Leonel asked with a slight frown.\nEven if Leonel knew it was foolish to have an outburst, it would be even more foolish to pretend nothing was wrong. If he didn't show any discontent, it would be even more suspicious.\n\"Of course not.\" Maia replied with a light smile. \"Even if you cannot enter Zones, we still need your help to clear out Invalids. The sooner our Province can start running like normal again, the better. Those like you and Miss Aina will be the backbone of such efforts.\"\nLeonel's internal sneer deepened. As long as he was on Earth and not sent back in time through a Sub-Dimensional Zone, how could any of his actions be hidden from them? Leonel wouldn't be surprised even if they assigned a satellite to monitor his every move.\n'My own personal satellite. I can't lie, that sounds kind of cool.' Leonel lightly joked with himself in an attempt to better his mood.\nAfter a few more rounds of empty words, Maia dismissed the other Tier 5 officials and personally monitored the remainder of the registration process.\nAs the night waned, more and more of Leonel's secrets were laid bare, a process that only made him more and more uncomfortable.\nIn the end, Maia's lingering fragrance became like the venomous gas of a poisonous serpent to him. She was practically attached to his hip, reading his expression diligently as though trying to find if he was hiding anything else.\nLeonel wanted to hide some things, but he ultimately decided against it.\nIn truth, he knew that he might have had some leeway. For example, the Empire's scanners seemed to have a problem with judging the merit of things at and above the S-grade. If not for this, why would the broad stroke 'Variant' grade exist?\nIf Leonel really wanted to, he could have passed off some high level treasures as being graded higher than they really were and use the excuse that he traded in his lower level rewards for them.\nHowever, there were two reasons Leonel decided against this.\nFirstly, he simply wasn't confident in continuing to hide these things. Not to mention technology of this era, even technology of a few hundred years ago was already potent enough that no one could escape under its detection. Leonel wasn't foolish enough to believe that he was the exception.\nHow could it be possible for him to continuously dodge the scrutiny of countless eyes and cameras? In the end, he would be forced to never use those rewards again for fear of the retaliation his lying would cause. The trade off wasn't worth it. These rewards were too useful to him.\nSecondly, there was an even more chilling possibility. What if the Empire was feigning ignorance?\nHadn't they already done so once? They clearly knew this Metamorphosis was coming, or else their wrist watches wouldn't be able to analyze Zones. Yet, they had said nothing.\nWho was to say that their detection devices weren't several times better than what they displayed and they were instead keeping some things covert to weed out dangerous variables and potential traitors?\nSuch thoughts made the cold in Leonel's heart grow chillier.\nSo, for now, he obediently took out every one of his rewards, describing them all to the best of his ability. Even when he came to those five objects Montez gave him, even though he didn't truly know what they were, he still gave his best explanation.\n\"… I was interested in Force Art, so I picked out these five things. This quill can draw Force Art, while these materials help in creating treasures that rely on Force Art.\"\nThis was Leonel's best guess. He believed that the pair of black gloves, the ores, and the special silver blob were all connected in some way.\nSeeing Leonel so obediently bring out so many treasures and describe them one by one caused Maia's expression to ease.\nThough she seemed in charge, the appearance of two Variants put great pressure on her. She wasn't lost to the fact this era had changed. Personal strength meant much more than it had in the past.\nUnfortunately, her own awakened ability wasn't very great, though, she was still more than satisfied with it. It wasn't wrong for Leonel to be so shocked that she was so young, because the truth was that she wasn't. In fact, her 60th birthday would be very soon.\nOf course, Leonel didn't know this, or else he might very well faint from shock.\nThis aside, she had a very good impression of Leonel right now and even found him to be quite adorable. Before she realized what was happening, she was treating him like her own grandson, seemingly not noticing that her current appearance of a 20 year old woman in her prime made it look more like she was flirting rather than doting on a youngster she was fond of.\nEventually, Leonel finished. He even decided to trade in some of his lower level treasures like his previous pair of shoes in exchange for some Ascension Points.\nA long while later, he was brought to his living quarters.\nAs a Variant, it wasn't a surprise that Royal Blue Fort wasn't stingy with him. In fact, he received a large mansion near the core of the hidden city to himself. He didn't even know what to do with all of the space.\nHe collapsed into bed, staring toward the ceiling expressionlessly. A wave of fatigue assaulted him. It could be said that this was the first time in almost a year that he had had such peace. But, it was ironically peace given to him by obediently dancing to the tune of the Empire. It was quite a bittersweet feeling.\nLeonel didn't even realize when he fell asleep. It wasn't until the sound of a ringing doorbell woke him up the next morning that he realized he had dozed off at all.\nHe had to practically sprint through the massive mansion for him to get downstairs in a timely manner, only to find a delicate beauty wearing a black military outfit filled with pockets waiting for him.\n\"Let's go do some missions.\" Aina said lightly.\nHer voice was as refreshing as morning dew.",

      "content": "Leonel was dazed for a moment before he blinked, a hint of confusion coloring his handsome face.\nHe had expected that once they came back, Aina would start avoiding him again. Now that they weren't in a Zone and couldn't enter one for a long while, she wouldn't have to feel bad about leaving him behind. But, he could have never imagined that she would actually come to seek him out first.\nAina was really too confusing to him. Did she want to avoid him, or not? Maybe she was moved by the words he spoke in Paris? Or, it was also possible that she decided that since he wouldn't give up on her, she might as well use him?\nLeonel might have been infatuated to the point of causing others to raise an eyebrow when it came to Aina, but he wasn't a fool. The matter of her lying about the entry quota had definitely stirred something within him.\nA part of Leonel wanted to believe that she wanted an excuse to spend more time with him, but he wasn't so vain. It was more likely related to her family…\nAina clearly had an even stronger motivation to grow powerful in comparison to Leonel. The most likely explanation was that she wanted as many rewards to herself as possible. Logically, then, entering with as few people as possible was the most beneficial to her.\nThough Leonel knew this was most likely the answer, he didn't hate her for it. He too made selfish decisions without asking for her opinion first within the Zone. In addition, she wasn't trying to harm him. They did indeed have the capability to clear it alone. The only variables were related to the Zone teetering on becoming a Unique Zone, but Aina hadn't known this until they entered.\n\"… Young miss!\"\nLeonel, who had been dazed to the point of staring at Aina for several long moments, was startled awake by a familiar voice.\nYuri, while holding up her skirt, ran forward like a delicate lady.\nLeonel glanced in her direction, then looked toward Aina, then back toward Yuri once more.\nAina: \"…\"\n\"Did you run away from her?\" Leonel's lip curled into a smile he tried to conceal as he spoke, teasing Aina.\n\"I picked a mission near where your Paradise Island might have fallen, you want to check it out, right?\" Aina bit her lip.\nLeonel's smile froze, but it wasn't out of anger or sadness. He knew that his father was fine now, so he hadn't been as stressed about the matter. But, Aina didn't know this. The fact she was so thoughtful warmed his heart.\nAfter a moment, Leonel grinned and looked toward Yuri who was still running toward them with all the might she could muster.\nHis hand swept forward and grabbed Aina's. It seemed it was Aina's turn to be dazed now.\n\"Let's run, then.\"\nLeonel grinned, slamming the mansion doors shut behind and sprinting through the streets with his arm, linked with Aina's, trailing behind.\nSeeing such a scene, Yuri could only stop, her delicate features covered with a thin layer of sweat. She panted for a moment then stomped her feet, clearly unresigned.\nAina's actions left her more than exasperated. In fact, she had an overwhelming feeling of anxiety swelling in her chest.\n\"… Miss! It's too dangerous outside!\"\nYuri's words sounded like the wild ravings of an overly controlling maid. But, only she and Aina knew that her worries weren't without cause, because this danger had nothing to do with Invalids.\n**\nEven hours later, Leonel's wild grin hadn't faded. But, this smile had nothing to do with being with Aina any longer. Rather, it had everything to do with the vehicle they were in.\nLeonel excitedly pressed on the gas pedal, winding through the wreckage of buildings with glee.\nHe had never had the opportunity to learn to drive. Cars were too rare due to the densely populated cities. Everything had been boiled down to incredibly expensive public transportation.\nSo, when Leonel found out that he could take out one of these armored jeeps thanks to his level of privileges, he practically jumped for joy.\n\"… Can't you drive a little slower?\" Aina asked for probably the dozenth time.\n\"We're almost there.\" Leonel replied with a smile.\nAina wished she had several more seat belts. Leonel's 'almost there' response had been the only reply she received in return in the last three hours. The words had completely lost all of their meaning.\nAt this point she could only swear to herself that even if Leonel pouted like a child, she would be the one to drive them back. She had lost count of the number of times the jeep almost flipped over.\nLuckily for her, this time around, Leonel really wasn't lying. They reached their destination in less than five minutes to find the sight of a wreckage that wiped the smile from Leonel's face.\nIt could be said that the once glorious city was a mess. But until now, Leonel had still not laid eyes on the wreckage of a Paradise Island. It could only be described as devastating.\nLike the crater of a fallen meteor, the surrounding several hundred meters had sunken deep into the ground. Let alone the remains of buildings, it was more accurate to say that the shattered remains of structures impossible to deduce the original form of were littered about in a wild and unconstrained way.\nThe subtle smell of rot pervaded the air. It wasn't obvious at first, and one could easily become used to it after a few moments, but it was exactly this that left Leonel feeling so stifled. All he could think about was the fact those who died here probably didn't even have corpses intact enough to produce a smell more forceful and obvious. Even in death, they hardly left their stamp on the world.\nLeonel clutched the wheel of the jeep so tightly that the creeks of its breaking plastic and his whitening hands could be heard through the silence.\nUnforgivable. This was truly unforgivable.",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 800 powerstones. Karma will get you all eventually...]\nLeonel's grip eventually loosened and he sat silently for a while. Soon, his breathing became steady once more.\nTo the side, Aina wasn't sure how to console Leonel. Of course, she wasn't aware that Leonel wasn't feeling this way due to the likely death of his father.\nRegardless, she had similar experiences of her own. Her own mother was dead and her father had likely followed in her footsteps. But, she had always had problems putting her emotions into words. She was always more likely to either implode or shut down. There didn't seem to be a third option for her.\nThis time around, she chose to shut down.\nLuckily for her, Leonel wasn't actually mourning the death of his father and quickly regained his composure, opening the driver's door and stepping out. It wasn't long before Aina followed behind him.\n\"… How did you know to come here directly? I thought it would take us a few days to find it at least.\" Aina tried a probing question.\nHer words weren't wrong. Paradise Islands follow orbits, so where they fell would be variable. She only picked a mission to clear Perimeter 7 because it was near the general area, but she didn't expect to find the wreckage so quickly.\nLeonel took a deep breath.\n\"I remember the time they fell and I know the orbit like the back of my hand, so calculating where it was wasn't a problem.\" He explained simply.\nThe orbits of Paradise Islands weren't public knowledge. Or rather, the majority of their routes weren't. Only their stop points were known, as for the path they followed between them, it could only be left up to conjecture.\nFor Leonel, who had been illegally traveling to the surface world for so many years already, it was simple to have this taboo knowledge.\nLeonel took a step and slid down the side of the crater.\nHe knew that whatever his father left behind, it wouldn't have a problem surviving the fall. He didn't believe that his old man was dumb enough to not have a method of protecting his things.\nA part of Leonel held a small piece of resentment for his father. After all, since he knew this was coming, couldn't he have saved these people?\nBut in the end, Leonel knew why he hadn't. Had he saved these people and then left, the Empire would definitely have all eyes trained onto Leonel. By then, even leaving the Fort to come to this place would have been impossible.\nLeonel found the wreckage he knew must have been his home and began to dig.\nHis home now had collapsed. Several large slabs of brick and stone folded atop of one another. In comparison to the other structures, this could be considered to be relatively intact.\nWith him and Aina's work together, it wasn't long before a small path was created and they could duck into the remains of his home's living room… if you could even call it that.\nTheir movements caused dust to fly into the air. The two covered their mouths but were unable to hold back their ensuing coughs.\n\"… Le…\"\nAina tried to start her attempt at saying some comforting words, but she backed out at the last moment again.\nIn her mind, there really was no point in checking this place. The best case scenario was seeing something he didn't want to see. Even if by some miracle his father survived the fall, it's already been more than half a year since then, how could a normal human survive for so long?\nHowever, Leonel pretended not to hear the start of her murmurings.\nHe stepped forward, carefully crawling up and through the wreckage. It wasn't long before Aina picked up on the fact that something was wrong. Leonel didn't look like a person looking for the remains of his father… Instead, he looked like he already had a destination in mind?\nSeemingly thinking of a possibility, she quickly followed and soon had her thoughts confirmed.\nLeonel appeared above the remains of a staircase that descended. Shockingly enough, though, there wasn't even the slightest crack. Let alone a crack, it seemed completely unaffected by things around it.\nAt the end of this staircase, a seemingly simple wooden door lay, equally as unaffected.\n'I guess you're not too useless, old man.' Leonel thought to himself.\nBy now, Aina was certain that Leonel was hiding something. However, she also didn't dare to speak because she knew why Leonel was going out of his way to not explain anything either. It didn't take a genius to know that they were likely being monitored.\nThe reason Leonel dared to come here despite this was because he believed his father would account for this as well.\nHe descended the steps and reached for the door handle, only to find it locked.\nLeonel frowned. 'Don't tell me that old man forgot to give me a key? No, there's no keyhole here, there's probably another way to open it…'\nAfter a moment. Leonel suddenly realized that the round door handle was a bit rough. It was a weird feeling because he could have sworn that it looked like smooth brass before. So where was this rough texture coming from?\nLeonel pulled his hand back and observed the knob. It really did appear to be smooth… What was the problem?\nReaching forward again, Leonel closed his eyes and touched the knob once more. As expected, it really was rough.\nHis body jolted as he suddenly thought of a possibility.\nLeonel calmed his mind and discarded his useless thoughts. His senses became many times more sensitive in that instant.\nThe rough texture on his hands became many times more refined. What once was an erratic, seemingly aimless pattern, gained itself a unique organization that projected itself into Leonel's mind.\nIn those moments, Leonel learned something else about his body. His eyes didn't seem to be as good as his other senses for some reason. He could tell the difference between a loaded and unloaded gun by their weight and now he could feel intricate patterns on his palms that his eyes couldn't see.\nFor now, Leonel wasn't aware of if this would always be the case or not, but for now, his sense of touch was definitely the highest amongst his original five senses. Or, rather, this was the only conclusion he could come up with based on the information he had.\n'It's a Force Art…' Leonel thought. '… A complicated lock, but it shouldn't be a problem.'\nLeonel's fundamentals in Force Art could be considered to be solid. It was likely no one else on Earth knew as much as he did. Well, aside from his own father, apparently.\nHowever, this lock wasn't meant to be some great test or an obstacle Leonel needed to cross. Opening it was actually incredibly simple.\nLeonel took control of his Force and poured it into the knob, slowly tracing across the fine, invisible lines.\nFor someone else, this task would have bordered on impossible. But for him, his spirit was simply too high for this little test.\nTen minutes later, a light click was heard and the knob finally turned, revealing a dark corridor.\nLeonel stepped in, followed by Aina who hadn't said a word during the entire process. The door clicked closed behind them with hardly a sound.\nIt wasn't long before the two of them found themselves in a small, dimly lit library.\nIn truth, it was difficult to give it such a moniker. Calling it a library was a bit inaccurate. There were only four bookcases with five shelves each. The books still totaled a few hundred, but compared to a real library, it was still far too small. It was more accurate to call this place a small office.\nAside from those four bookcases, there were several shorter cases with several cubicles. These cubicles were filled to the brim with countless scrolls. These scrolls seemed to number even more than the few hundred books themselves.\nThen, there was a plain workbench at the very center. It had several odd wells dipped into its seemingly dark oak surface and Leonel could see deep etchings drawn all across its body. But other than that, there was nothing else that stood out about it.\nRather than this, there were two things that left Aina and Leonel a bit stunned.\nFor one… Books? Scrolls? Wasn't the use and creation of paper banned? How could there be so many here?\nAnd secondly… There were three pedestals at the end of the office. Each was covered by a small dome of light that seemed to manifest from thin air.\nOn each of the pedestals, there was a single object.\nThe first was a bland black ring that seemed unpolished as though its creator couldn't be bothered with its final look. The second was a black cube that seemed put together like a jigsaw puzzle. And the last was a small silver plate not even four inches across, it was uniform in all areas with the exception of a small indent at its very center.",

      "content": "Leonel stood silently for a moment then took a step forward.\nAina gazed toward his back with a complicated look. Why would he allow her to come here? It can't be that he really trusted her to this extent, right?\nBut when she thought about it, what other choice did Leonel have? She sprung this sudden mission on him without warning and even plainly said it was in the area his Paradise Island might have fallen.\nLet's assume for a moment that he didn't come here? What then? What if he waited until he separated from Aina to come to this place? What would those observing him think of this?\nIt was obvious. Their first instinct would be to think that he was hiding something.\nHowever, Aina's actions gave him a good opportunity. There was a level of spontaneity that made everything seem natural. He really seemed like a boy who was looking for the remains of his father.\nWhen Aina analyzed things to this point, she found a corner and crossed her legs in meditation.\nOf course, she had no idea that this was only part of the truth. There were ultimately still many ways Leonel could have avoided this outcome. He could have made her wait outside under the pretext he wanted to grieve alone, for example.\nThe ultimate reason he allowed her to come here was because he trusted her. It was as simple as this.\nWhether that trust was due to his rosy colored glasses or if she was really worthy of it, maybe even Leonel himself didn't know.\nLeonel noticed that Aina had closed her eyes and had stopped paying attention to her surroundings, but he didn't say much about it. He continued forward and eventually stopped at the pedestal furthest to the left.\nHe reached forward through the barrier of energy. He had thought that it would stop him, but surprisingly, it didn't. His hand passed right through as though it was nothing more than air.\nLeonel picked up the unpolished ring. As expected, it had a texture similar to an uneven coat of dry paint.\nAfter observing it for a while, he couldn't find anything special about it. He even got the vague feeling that it wasn't even in front of him despite the fact he was very much aware that it was in his hand.\nSuddenly thinking of something, Leonel stopped observing with his eyes and focused all his attention on his hands. Maybe he could find something similar to the Force Art on the door handle?\nBut, Leonel was soon disappointed. No matter how he looked at it, this really was just a ring with a poor finish quality. Whoever made this thing really must have not cared for his craft very much.\n'Wait…'\nJust when Leonel was feeling stumped, he thought back to Montez teaching him how to use his spatial bracelet. What if this was a similar item?\n'… Take control of my Internal Sight… Concentrate it… Imagine opening a door…'\nThe truth was that not everyone could use spatial treasures even if they had one on hand. To the current Earth, those who even had Internal Sight were a rare few. And, those who could control it were even fewer.\nIf Leonel had been willing to risk it and hid the existence of his spatial bracelet, it was unlikely anyone at Royal Blue Fort would be able to call him out on it.\nJust when Leonel was about to succeed, he felt a BOOM resound in his mind.\nPain ravaged his thoughts and blood dripped from his nose.\nHe fell backward in a daze, crashing to the ground.\nTo an outside observer, he was staring blankly at the ceiling, not even reacting to his head rebounding off the hard floors. However, if one looked closely, his eyes were completely vacant as though he had already died.\nShocked by the sudden noise, Aina's eyes flashed open. When she saw Leonel on the ground, she shot up and to his side, but no matter what she did, she couldn't seem to wake him up.\nWhile Leonel's body was being violently shaken by Aina, his mind was in a completely different place. He felt as though he had stepped foot into a hellish world. No, he might not even disagree if one said this was hell itself.\nAbove, clouds of black-red rolled, the low rumbling of thunder beating against his ears repeatedly.\nIn the distance, these clouds formed vertical swirls of cyclones and tornadoes, touching the ground like demonic omens of greed and gluttony.\nThe ground was covered in sands of grey and black. However, these specks of earth looked more like the world had been covered in a thin layer of dust rather than being an actual part of the world itself.\nIn the distance, Leonel could see the ground begin to roll into small hills. The further into the distance he looked, these hills gradually grew in size, eventually becoming small mountains. In the end of it all, there was a mountain of black so tall that even the rumbling clouds above were pierced through by it.\nStill, this wasn't the end of it.\nWhat caught Leonel's attention the most in this hellish place weren't the tornado clouds, the suffocating atmosphere, or even the impossibly tall mountains. What he couldn't take his eyes off of were the countless polearms pierced into the ground.\nLike a densely packed graveyard, countless spears were dotted across the world. Some of them were broken, others were whole, some had dried blood caking their polearms, while yet others were spotless.\nLeonel stood in a daze for a long while before he finally licked his dry lips. What the hell was this place?\nLeonel tried to take a step forward, but suddenly found that a mountain was weighing on his shoulders.\nSweat fell from his brows as he gritted his teeth, eventually struggling forward by just a single step. However, even though he succeeded, it felt like half of his body's stamina had been drained.\nLeonel reached to the side to find something to steady his wobbling knees, eventually catching hold of the shaft of a wooden spear. However, the result was completely outside his expectations.\nAnother BOOM resounded in his mind.\nHe suddenly found himself in another world, racing through a jungle.\nA single layer of beast skin covered his lower half, his bare torso rippling with muscle as he hopped from tree to tree with nothing but a wooden spear in his hand.\nWhat seemed to be a saber toothed tiger raced toward him from below, roaring as though completely enraged.\nA laughter left Leonel's lips, but he somehow felt that it wasn't a laughter that came from him.\nCompletely unable to control his body, his free hand caught onto a vine and swung downward in a wild but controlled arc.\nAt the perfect moment, he let go, his spear cocking backward as a savage grin coated his features.\nUnable to react, the back of the saber tooth tiger's head was completely pierced through, its last roar being followed by a gurgling of blood.\nLeonel found himself sitting on the tiger's massive head. He pulled the spear from the beast's skull, savagely licking the blood that drenched his spear and palm.\nA moment later, Leonel jolted awake. He suddenly felt something heavy on his chest, making him think that he might have returned to that hell scape graveyard of spears, but he soon realized that the pressure wasn't heavy enough.\n\"… Aina?\"\nLeonel frowned, realizing the weight on his chest came from a delicate fragrance that made his senses feel incomparably comfortable. When he noticed how soft the weight was, and even sensed that his chest was a bit wet, he realized that this 'weight' was actually a sobbing girl.\n\"You…\"\nAina looked up from Leonel's chest. Her amber eyes were puffy with tears, giving them a red hue that Leonel felt bad for thinking suited her. There was something about this crying Aina that made his heart stir uncontrollably.\nHe didn't even think before he hugged her, causing her to fall back into his chest.\n\"What happened?\" Leonel asked, trying to appear soothing.\nBut, he couldn't have expected what happened next. In fact, he didn't even truly register what happened at all. It was just that he found it weird he was looking up at the ceiling again.\nWhen Leonel landed on the ground again, he only barely registered a pair of slender legs walking by him as he slid across the floor. And, by the time he sat up, Aina was back in her corner with her eyes closed as though nothing had happened.\nLeonel couldn't help but laugh.",

He felt as though his mind was completely drained, even his control over his Force was severely weakened.\n'My spirit dropped…'\nLeonel looked up toward the ceiling and frowned. He could vaguely feel that it wasn't a permanent drop, but was rather temporary. He could probably recover it after taking a nap as he didn't have a quicker method.\n[Dimensional Cleanse] resulted in his spirit growing, this was especially after he formed his First Star. However, Leonel knew that it was more of a byproduct rather than a direct influence.\nPracticing [Dimensional Cleanse] strengthened his ability, and his ability seemed to influence his spirit. This was the link between the two occurrences. [Dimensional Cleanse] had no direct impact on his spirit, so the only method he had to deal with this problem was time.\nLeonel knew now that his spirit was obscenely high. Aina had formed her seventh Force Node now, yet her spirit wasn't even 10% of his own. The gap was massive.\nIn addition, from Leonel's observations, Aina's spirit hadn't improved when moving from six Force Nodes to seven, unlike Leonel's which experienced a leap every time he formed one.\nBut, this once again proved his conjecture. Forming Force Nodes strengthened his ability which in turn strengthened his spirit. Unless someone else had a similar ability to his own, he likely had the highest spirit stat on Earth currently, and by a large margin, at that.\nLeonel was so weak and lost in his thoughts that it took him several moments to realize that there was a spear in his hand, and even a few seconds more to realize that this was the very same spear he had tried to use to steady himself in that hell world.\n'This… Isn't this too crude…'\nLeonel weakly sat up, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\nTo call the spear in his hand primitive was an understatement. It was made of wood that had a natural and slight curve to it, completely unlike the perfect straight spears Leonel had become used to. Its blade, if one could even call it that, consisted of a sharpened grey stone wrapped to the tip by twine. And, if all this wasn't enough, it was caked with a dried brownish red substance it took Leonel a while to realize was blood…\nAt that moment, Leonel suddenly remembered that Montez had told him he would soon have more spears than he knew what to do with. Is this what that stingy man meant by that? These were the spears he was meant to be bathing in? Where was the joke? He was still waiting.\nAfter observing the spear for a while, Leonel sighed. At this point, might as well just keep using that D-grade spear. It wasn't as though it was treating him wrong. If it came to it, he could just use some Ascension Points for a better spear.\n'Damned old man, you really left me something so useless. Is this supposed to be a practical joke? Haha, you got me.' Leonel scolded in his mind and rolled his eyes.\nIf it was just one spear, it wouldn't be a big deal. The problem was Leonel had been in that world. For the first several hundred meters, there was nothing but wooden and broken spears. As for beyond that, the world was too dark for him to see clearly.\nConsidering how hard it was to take just one step, who knew how long it would take him to travel far enough to get something decent?\nLeonel ginger stood up, bitterly smiling as he stared at the primitive spear.\n'Maybe I'm judging a book by its cover?'\nThinking to this point, Leonel communicated with his spatial bracelet to bring out a familiar spear and raised it up to slash it against the wooden spear. Who knew, maybe he would get a surprise?\nUnfortunately, reality was cruel… He did get a surprise… It just wasn't the one he was looking for.\nBefore the D-grade spear could even make contact, the unpolished ring on Leonel's ring vibrated and emitted a searing heat.\nLeonel blinked in shock, not only due to the sudden change, but because he didn't remember putting this ring on his finger. How had it gotten there?\nLeonel couldn't even react before his D-grade spear burst into a rain of ash, rendering him speechless.\nHis spear… It was gone just like that… And it wasn't due to the fact he had gotten some OP spear… but rather because this damned unpolished ring had thrown a tantrum…\nWhere was the justice?\n\"Pft…\"\nAina's light giggling caught Leonel's attention, but when he looked over, her eyes had closed once more. It was as though the sound hadn't come from her at all.\nLeonel could only leave her be, trying every method he had to pull the ring from his finger, but it was to no avail.\nHe could only give up, his teeth grinding away. That old man really did play a prank on him.\n'Dammit…'\nThere was nothing he could do. Without another choice, he stepped toward the center pedestal, feeling incomparably aggrieved.\n'These other things you left better not be so useless…'\nOf course, Leonel wasn't foolish enough to think that the ring really was useless. But, he still felt the need to vent his grievances.\nLeonel reached forward and grabbed toward the silver plate. However, this time he failed to do so. Or, more accurately, he didn't get the chance to.\nThe silver plate suddenly vibrated and a hologram projection suddenly manifested itself.\nThe image was of a handsome man with rich olive skin and a strong jaw. He wore a pair of glasses and he seemed quite scholarly. He was the kind of man who made immature women swoon and mature women choose as their ideal lover.\nHowever, when Leonel saw him, the grinding of his teeth only grew fiercer.\nThe hologram opened its eyes and seemed to see Leonel before it looked at the spear in his hand and burst out into a fit of laughter. When it saw the pile of ash behind Leonel, its laughter grew fiercer to the point it might have begun to leak tears had it not been a hologram.\nThe handsome and cool demeanor of the hologram completely vanished as he laughed without restraint. It seemed to be having the time of its life.\n\"Idiot.\" The hologram said. \"Normally people go for the middle first, who asked you to start with the left pedestal. I even put it a few steps ahead of the other two.\"\n\"Don't patronize me, old man. Everyone reads left to right, why wouldn't I start with the left? Plus, you have to leave the best for last, I just didn't know that this 'best' was you.\"\n\"Don't blame me for your stupid mistakes, blame yourself.\"\n\"You're just a cheap sci-fi rip off. A first generation hologram projection, really? Is this the 22nd century?\"\nSuddenly the hologram began laughing again, leaving Leonel confused.\n\"You idiot, I can imagine it now, you're probably talking to me like I have a real consciousness. I'm a recording. Damn, I really have a fool for a son.\"\nIf it was up to Leonel, after hearing these words, he would tackle this hologram to the ground. Though, he'd probably get beaten just like all the other times, he would have definitely taken down the old man with him.\nHe had really fallen for such a simple trick, dammit. He remembered the old man telling him about prank voicemail messages he used to leave in the past, he also remembered brushing it off saying that only an idiot would fall for such a thing. Yet, here he was.\nAina's light giggling could be heard in the undercurrents, but the hologram didn't react. Clearly, it wasn't lying, this really was a recording.\nLeonel really didn't know why his father was obsessed with all this old tech. First paper, now holograms? This sort of technology had been phased out a long time ago. No one wanted to look at a transparent image all day. It was cool in movies, but in practice, it was an annoyance.\n\"Whew, that was a good laugh. And if you're thinking of pretending you didn't fall for it when you meet me next, don't worry. I've already recorded this moment and saved it well.\"\nLeonel, seeing that his last spark of hope was gone, could only sigh. He really had thoroughly lost this time. He vowed to get the old man back one day.\n\"Anyway, we can get down to some more serious stuff now.\" Leonel's father's expression grew more serious. Even as a projection, he radiated a unique, suffocating aura.\n\"The ring on your finger is an heirloom of our Morales Clan. It's simply known as Spear Domain and it is thanks to it that our Morales Clan awakened our Spear Domain Lineage Factor. There are only three other treasures like it, or rather, only three others that have owners.\n\"With it, all spears are useless before you. Only spears recognized by the Spear Domain ring can survive beneath its presence, all others will become a pile of ash. However, in return, you can only use spears that you have earned the acknowledgment of.\n\"That said, I hope the Spear Domain Lineage Factor isn't the first you awaken. If it is, I promise you I'll disown you as my son.\"\nLeonel coughed awkwardly, suddenly thinking back to Montez's uproarious laughter.",

      "content": "Leonel didn't know what to say to this. His father's expression seemed serious, but Leonel had known for a long time what his father was like. This serious expression was just an act. However, Leonel could still tell that this 'act' came from a place of seriousness.\nThe sigh he heard come from the hologram a moment later confirmed this much as well.\n\"Forget it, forget it. It's impossible to tell what kind of mutations might occur. Your birth is a bit of a special case. So, though you're my seed and should have a higher chance of awakening our Ancestral Lineage Factor first, something outside of my calculations might happen.\n\"Anyway, this recorded message will end now. Think of this silver disk as a dictionary left behind by me, your great and amiable, not to mention handsome, father.\"\nLeonel rolled his eyes again when he saw that his old man was back to his joking ways. How many times did he have to tell this old man to not call him his 'seed'.\nBut he was grateful nonetheless. What he lacked the most was information. And, for some reason, while Montez couldn't give it to him, his father's projection could.\n\"Alright then… What is our Ancestral Lineage Factor?\" Leonel probed the hologram.\nThe hologram had lost the previous animated emotions it had, but Leonel still found it soothing to hear his father's voice, even if it was automated.\n[ *Ping* The Ancestral Lineage Factor of the Morales Clan is known as Metal Synergy. ]\n\"What is the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor?\"\n[ *Ping* The Metal Synergy Lineage Factor is the Ancestral Lineage Factor of the Morales Clan. ]\nLeonel thought this was another prank at first, but after a moment, he seemed to understand something.\n\"What are the abilities of the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor?\"\n[ *Ping* The Metal Synergy Lineage Factor has many abilities. It can most appropriately be described as the envy of all Force Crafters. ]\n[ *Information Omitted* ]\n[ Scanning Seed. ]\nLeonel felt a surge of energy course through him.\n[ Seed has not awakened Metal Synergy Lineage Factor. Information cannot be unlocked. ]\n'… Please don't tell me this damn thing is going to call me 'seed' from now on…'\nIn the end, Leonel could only sigh.\nIt seemed he had to ask really specific questions to get specific answers. If not, the response would be short and to the point, and maybe miss out on something he needed to know. In addition, some information was barred from him unless he met certain criteria.\nAfter thinking for a moment, Leonel asked another question.\n\"Why is it that my old man wanted me to awaken Metal Synergy first?\"\n[ *Ping* The Morales Clan is divided into two branches. Velasco Morales was born to the Metal Synergy Branch though he later awakened his Spear Domain Lineage Factor as well. ]\n[ *Information Omitted* ]\n[ Seed is not yet strong enough to return to the Morales Clan. Information cannot be unlocked. ]\n\"Alright, alright. Fine. How does this Spear Domain ring work?\"\n[ *Ping* The Spear Domain ring is entered by the consciousness. The stronger one's Internal Sight, the further one can travel. Each spear has been acknowledged by the ring and has a thread of Internal Sight attached to it that gives insights toward the Way of the Spear. ]\n[ *Information Omitted* ]\n[ Scanning Seed. ]\n[ Seed has awakened Spear Domain Lineage Factor but has not grasped Spear Force. Information unable to be unlocked. ]\n'For the love of God, stop calling me seed…'\nLeonel's eyes narrowed. His father was born into the Metal Synergy branch of the family, but was somehow able to pass down the Spear Domain ring to him? If there wasn't some story behind this, Leonel wouldn't believe it.\n\"What is Spear Force?\" Leonel asked.\n[ *Ping* Spear Force is a Force Strengthening Deviation. It is sharper than normal Force and carries the strength of a Force Technique without the need to use one. ]\n\"What is a Force Strengthening Deviation?\" Leonel asked, suddenly thinking of the weird red glow on Aina's axes.\n[ *Ping* A Force Strengthening Deviation is a mutation in Force that amplifies its power in a certain path. ]\nLeonel drowned the silver plate in questions. Though many things were omitted due to his own weakness, he still learned a lot nonetheless. If it wasn't for the fact he was scared he would attract suspicion by staying here too long, he would have asked more.\n\"What is this?\"\nLeonel picked up the last object his father left. A black cube that was put together like a jigsaw puzzle.\n[ *Ping* This is an heirloom of the Morales Clan known as the Segmented Cube. ]\nLeonel's lip twitched. This old man didn't give him the heirlooms of both branches of their family, did he? Leonel didn't need to know the story behind this to know that there were definitely several unhappy individuals.\n\"What are the abilities of the Segmented Cube?\"\n[ *Ping* The Segmented Cube is a darling treasure of Force Crafters. It is a lab. ]\n[ *Information Omitted* ]\n[ Scanning Seed. ]\n[ Seed has not awakened Metal Synergy Lineage Factor. Information cannot be unlocked. ]\nLeonel sighed. He had been hoping that this thing would be able to analyze Zones for him. But, it turned out to be a lab. A lab he couldn't even open at that. He wasn't a Force Crafter so he couldn't even make use of this thing.\nIt seemed he had made a mistake by not using one of his rewards on a Zone Analysis Device.\n'Hold on…'\n\"What is this thing called and what are its abilities?\"\nLeonel brought out a familiar cube with the very same childish silver glob. However, even in comparison to the past, it was even more hyper than usual. It continually rammed against the side of the cube as though trying to get to the Segmented Cube.\n[ *Ping* Species of Metal Spirit detected. Metal Spirit in its infant stages. The Metal Spirit is the favorite Familiar of Force Crafters. ]\n[ *Information Partially Omitted* ]\n[ Abilities ]\n[ Metal Refinement: Able to process and remove impurities from ores. ]\n[ Metal Formation: Able to fuse into the structure of metals and change its form, perfect for crafting intricate parts. ]\n[ … ]\n[ Metal Spirit in infant stages. Abilities limited. ]\n[ Metal Spirit: Unnamed ]\n[ Evolution Stage: Tier 1 Black ]\nLeonel frowned. He thought this was a Tier 7 Black reward, why was this Metal Spirit infant only at the Tier 1 evolution stage?\nHow could Leonel know that Montez had used a loophole to bend the rules? Let alone a Tier 7 Black reward, a Metal Spirit was worth more than even a Tier 9 Gold reward. In fact, infants were worth more than even mature Metal Spirits.\nStill, though he didn't know this truth, his mind was still spinning. Since this Metal Spirit was a living thing and it had evolution stages, it should be possible to help it mature, right?\nJust when Leonel was about to ask the silver plate some more questions, a violent tremor suddenly shook the underground space, causing Leonel's eyes to narrow.\nThis wasn't a normal phenomenon. Someone was attacking them from above.\n'Dammit. It's been only half an hour. It can't be that they really came after us for this, right? No, it's definitely something else.'\nJust when Leonel was at a loss for what to do, the Segmented Cube suddenly spun in his palm, breaking into its several pieces and engulfing the entire room. Before Leonel realized what had happened, the cube had expanded to the size of a room and back to the size of his palm in the blink of an eye.\nBut, while it seemed like nothing had changed, Leonel immediately realized that all the bookshelves and cubicles filled with scrolls had vanished, leaving nothing in the small office.\nThe loud booms continued.\nTo Leonel's shock, the room that had remained unaffected after a fall from the skies suddenly began to crumble.\n\"Dammit!\"\nLeonel placed the Segmented Cube and silver plate into his spatial bracelet before making eye contact with Aina.\nHe was shocked to find that she was emitting a dangerous aura, a stifling killing intent springing forth from her small body.\n'She knows who these people are?'\nThere was no time to communicate, the two shot down the crumbling corridor, bursting out to find themselves surrounded.\nWhen Aina saw these people, the violent aura on her body grew by several times, her killing intent piercing into the skies. At this moment, her presence was no weaker than Leonel's when he focused.\n\"Aina Atheleys Brazinger. Daughter of traitorous scum Adam Renier Brazinger. You are summoned by the Clan Elders to seek repentance.\"",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 1200... I admit defeat... it will be 300 ps a bonus chapter next week... *weeps*]\nThere were six of them. Every single one had fiery red hair and blazing red eyes. It was the kind of scene that was incredulous to Leonel, a normal youth who grew up on Earth.\nEven Aina's bright, almost golden, amber eyes had a near fantastical element to them. But how could a person with red eyes really exist? For a moment, he thought they were wearing contact lenses before he directly tossed out such an idea. It can't be that all six of them had such a weird hobby, right?\nThe man who spoke had a high bridged nose, his arrogance flaring along with his nostrils. He had one hand clasped behind his back, but in the other, there was a very familiar red ax that made Aina's fury soar even higher.\nSince they had just been in the jeep, Aina hadn't been able to keep her ax on her back. So, she placed it in the trunk. Normally, she would have taken it out with her in case a battle happened, but she had been absent minded after Leonel stepped out of the car. Due to her worry and her attempts to try to find something to say to console him, she had completely forgotten to bring along her weapon.\nLeonel immediately realized this fact. He didn't know what significance the ax had to Aina, but all he needed to know was that it was important to her. And, hearing how this man so blatantly insulted her father in such a way, even he couldn't help but frown.\n\"Erase this weapon from your memory.\" The man sneered when he saw Aina's gaze. \"This mighty Heirloom of the Brazinger family… since when was it the right of a bastard child to wield, let alone the fact this bastard is a woman.\"\nLeonel's expression darkened.\nSix middle-aged men came to bully a young girl of not even 20 years old. Even if Aina wasn't the woman he liked, he would be enraged.\nLeonel palm flicked upward and his dented shield slid onto his left arm which held tightly onto the Metal Spirit. The grip his right hand had on the wooden spear tightened, his expressionless visage acting like a cover for brewing storm.\nThat day, when those three goons dared to insult Aina, he crossed over his own moral boundaries and slayed them without blinking an eye. Even he wasn't proud of this moment. He wanted to maintain his clarity when he killed. He didn't want to become a slave to his rage.\nHowever, this man had truly touched his bottom line.\n\"That ax. Return it.\"\nLeonel's voice was like a steady stream. Calm and controlled, he pointed his primitive wooden spear toward the man.\nLooking at Leonel's spear, the six men found it difficult to hold back their laughter.\n\"What kind of monkey tool is this exactly?\"\n\"Kid, if you know what's good for you, you'll take a step back and stay out of these matters.\"\nThe cold words of the first man who spoke cut through the jeers. His body seemed to brim with power, making him appear like a beast restrained by chains. However, even still, his words had barely fallen when Leonel had already shot forward.\nLeonel knew why these people were here now, and he even caught a faint inkling of why Yuri would chase after Aina like that to stop her from leaving. Originally, he thought that she just didn't want the two of them to continue spending time together, but it seemed he had wronged her with his thoughts.\nIt was no coincidence that these people didn't appear during the days he, Aina, James and the others were traveling to Royal Blue Fort, yet appeared now.\nHe remembered Aina's words from that day quite well…\n\"The only reason I still carry their name is so that I can reject it myself when they most wish for me to keep it.\"\nThe moment they learned that she was a Variant, they came here to flaunt themselves and even took her prized possession. These people were scum.\nThe man's gaze narrowed as he swung Aina's ax.\nHowever, what neither the man nor Leonel expected was that before they could even trade blows, a small fist would collide with the man's face.\nWith Leonel's senses having sharpened to the point of near enlightenment, he caught every detail. The break in the tall bridge of his nose, the crack that followed in his teeth, the way his skin and face deformed beneath the weight of the strike…\nThe man was sent flying, crashing through several fallen buildings without even the ability to stop himself.\nIn that moment, Aina had appeared in the midst of the five remaining men. Her bloodthirsty aura reached into the skies, her long hair wildly whipping about as a crimson energy coated them.\nThough Leonel could only see her backview from his standpoint, he could feel her fury. If it wasn't for the fact she had already formed her Seventh Node and stabilized her Force, she would have most definitely already entered a berserk state. In fact, even then, it seemed like she might lose her mind again regardless.\nLeonel's pupils constricted into pinholes.\nIt was only now he realized just how much he had underestimated Aina. Her unstable aura hadn't just affected her mental state, but it very clearly negatively influenced her stats.\nShe hadn't activated her Force just now, so logically, the influence of her Seventh Node shouldn't have been so obvious just yet. However…\n[Aina Brazinger]\n[Strength: 1.49; Speed: 1.03 (1.22?); Agility: 1.08; Coordination: 1.10; Stamina: 1.31; Reactions: 1.12; Spirit: 0.06; Force: ???]\nIn that instant, her burst of speed was most definitely higher than her base stats. Leonel suspected she either used an item she received as a reward, or a technique of some sort that utilized a power outside of Force.\nHer instability really had such a large effect on her.\n'These six don't seem to have the same instability. Uncle Montez even said that Clans keep a very tight grip on their Lineage Factor techniques. Could Aina's instability be due to the fact she doesn't have their technique to practice?'\n\"Do you think I need your heirloom?\" Aina's voice carried a biting cold. \"If it wasn't because my father wished for me to keep it, I would have thrown it into the nearest scrapyard. Don't think of leaving here alive today!\"\nLeonel's gaze flickered as the man weakly stood from the pile of rubble. The men around Aina glared at her with trepidation and anger, but also caution. They didn't dare to move recklessly just yet.\nThe man's face was completely distorted. His face was savagely sunken, making it impossible to tell what expression he was trying to convey. But, the sudden roar he shot into the skies made it clear that it was rage.\nHis body began to morph, growing more than a foot and springing forward with dense patches of fur.\nIt wasn't just him, but the five men also underwent similar transformations.\nLeonel's frown deepened.\nThe good news was that now they didn't need to be in the dark about their abilities any longer.\nAs for the bad news… Their stats all increased by more than 20%. Their strength stats especially… doubled.\nBefore, the strongest strength stat was a mere 0.80. But now, the man who now had the face of a wolf, howling into the skies like a madman towering at almost eight feet tall, had crossed 1.60.\n\"I'll tear you limb from limb and drag you back to the Clan as a cripple! I'll be sure you experience even worse dread than your whore mother!\"",

      "content": "[Author's Note: I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding from the last chapter. The Brazinger Clan isn't a werewolf clan, though I can see now how that could be the conclusion you guys would make. I won't say anymore, I prefer to explain via the story's narrative]\nThe man's face distorted. The cracks to his bones and teeth healed as his nose became a snout and his hands gained claws.\nThe clothes on his back tore to shreds, revealing a tight compression suit that covered much of his fur.\nThough all six were weremen, the beasts they morphed into were completely different. While the man who wielded Aina's ax seemed to be crossbred with a wolf, one seemed more akin to a fox, another looked more like a hyena with gross colored yellow fur. In addition, there was a panther, a cheetah-like man, and finally a … rat?\nOf all the men, there was one who instead of growing in size shrank instead. In addition, the boosts to his stats were the most minimal. However, when Leonel's gaze landed on him, the blaring sounds of warning shot through his mind.\nLeonel couldn't understand where this warning was coming from. He was certain that he didn't have such an ability. So what was going on?\nUnfortunately, there wasn't time to think about it. The werewolf's howl had come to an end, fiendish growls and dripping saliva fell from his sharp teeth, a crazed glare piercing toward Aina.\nHe gripped Aina's ax, his muscles pushing against his compression clothing like tightened steel cords. The power brimming in his body was simply unimaginable.\nHis and Aina's gazes collided in the air before they simultaneously shot forward, fury painting both of their features.\nLeonel no longer hung back. He was already not far from the group after his initial charge. In addition, it was in none of their best interests for this battle to drag on.\nAs though in tacit agreement, none of them used their Force. If they did so and caused an Invalid horde to make their way here… They wouldn't even know how they died.\nLeonel stopped hesitating, his wooden spear piercing toward the werehyena.\nHe had expected it to be no more than a normal strike. But, the moment he used the spear, he felt a savage aura envelop his body. It was as though he had entered the jungle once more, and this man before him was not a man, but rather a real beast…\nLeonel's eyes reddened, a savage grin appearing on his face.\nHis sudden change caused the werehyena to be at a loss. Before the latter could react, the stone blade had already appeared at his neck. In that moment, he really felt he would lose his life. The bloodthirsty pressure emitting from Leonel was no different than one of a predator stalking his prey.\nA claw suddenly appeared before the werehyena's throat. The werepanther had reacted quickly, his blackened paw leaving silver streaks in the air to bat Leonel's spear away.\nIt should have been a simple task. His claws were no weaker than a C-grade blade. The sight of him dicing up the stone blade of Leonel's monkey weapon had already played in his mind countless times.\nBut reality was cruel.\nLeonel's savage grin didn't fade as his wrist twisted. With impossible coordination, the werepanther's claw, which had been aimed at the flat of the blade, was suddenly aimed at its edge.\nLeonel's arm swept upward as though this was the strike he wanted to levy from the very beginning.\nThe agonizing roars of the werepanther sounded as three of his bestial fingers had been lost.\nLeonel didn't give him time to retreat. His hips swung, his legs flexed, his toes almost dug through his treasure shoes to leave ten indents on the broken concrete beneath their feet.\nHis body was like a well oiled engine. Each action was perfectly supported by a supplementary muscle. The tiniest fibers, the weakest ligaments, each was put into motion, squeezing out their greatest potential.\nIf Leonel was truly conscious at this moment, he would realize that his coordination stat had touched upon an eye popping number.\nHis speed exploded, reaching the chest of the roaring werepanther in a flash. He had lost the werehyena due to his interruption, so shouldn't he pay a price?\nThe actions were too sudden. The head of a man turned panther flew into the skies, a fountain of blood raining down and coating Leonel.\nDroplets of crimson fell onto Leonel's face. Though the sounds of Aina and the werewolf acted as a backdrop, to the four remaining beastmen around him, it felt like the world had fallen silent.\nLeonel turned his head back toward the four. Maybe by coincidence, a tear of blood fell to the corner of his lips.\nHis tongue snaked out, licking it away as though he was savoring the last drop of a meal.\nThe Spear Domain ring glowed and vibrated excitedly on his finger. It released a searing heat that poured into the primitive spear.\nThe four beastmen inadvertently took a step back.\nThey could see it clearly. It felt like the temperature was steadily rising, but there was clearly no fire ability attached to Leonel's state. It was as though his blood was boiling with excitement instead. He was so excited to kill them that steam was emitting from his body, covering the air around him in a faint white mist.\nAt that moment, the sound of bones being cracked and blood curdling screams resounded through the battlefield.\nThe four beastmen looked over to find Aina savagely stomping and grinding into the werewolf's digitigrade legs.\nHer ax had already been flung to the side, the crimson aura coating her body radiating out with a fierce momentum.\nThe sight of a small woman of barely 5'7\" torturing a beastman who stood at over seven feet made others feel the need to wipe their eyes clean. But, there was no mistake about it.\nThe current Leonel didn't seem to care for these changes. In fact, he hadn't even looked over to where Aina was. The moment he saw that his prey had actually looked away from him, he sensed opportunity. It was a gripping feeling that surged through his heart, an instinct ingrained into his very being.\nThe werefox only managed to react after his next attempt at speech came out like the gargles of a baby. His last sight was that of a spear jetting out from his throat.\nLeonel wanted to take advantage of the situation to lop off another head, but before he could, a surging tide of Force shot into the skies.\nLeonel's expression changed, the crimson in his eyes fading away as he regained clarity. He didn't even have time to wonder just what had happened to his state of mind just now. His head whipped back toward Aina and the werewolf's body, only to find that the situation had changed once more.\nAina had created some distance between herself and the werewolf. Her expression was a mixture of disdain and a small bit of helplessness. She knew she had made a mistake. Her actions were emotional and rage fueled. Had she simply killed the werewolf instead of giving him a chance to activate his Force, this wouldn't have happened.\nObviously, she hadn't been overwhelmed by the Force of this werewolf. Rather, she had chosen not to use her Force, not much unlike all the others. However, this fool actually used his without regard for the situation.\nThey were in the middle of nowhere. The nearest Fort was at least a three hour's drive away. Yet, this idiot released his Force like this.\nLeonel's expression turned serious. He could already sense several Invalids who had turned their attention toward this place.",

      "content": "Leonel's expression continually flickered.\nHe quickly sent a glance toward where he had left their jeep, but what he saw left his expression twisted.\nBefore, he hadn't dared to take his eyes off of the enemy, so aside from observing the six men, he had done nothing else. However, when he saw that Aina's ax had been taken by that man, he had a bad premonition. It turned out that that bad premonition had been correct.\nThe vehicle was too well armored to be completely destroyed from the outside, but judging by the fact its hood was currently opened, it didn't take a genius to know that there was no chance of it starting up.\nJust like that, one of Leonel's escape routes was dashed.\n'Not all hope is lost. I don't believe that they were able to get here so quickly using their legs.'\nLeonel was going to continue scanning the edge of the large crater to find what exactly the six had used to get here, but he suddenly felt his spine tingle.\nWithout hesitation, he ducked and rolled, barely managing to dodge a claw whipping toward the back of his neck.\nThe dust from the ground had hardly clung to his rolling body when a powerful kick swept from the werecheetah.\nLeonel could only contort his body, barely blocking with his dented shield.\nThe kick sent him tumbling, skidding across the ground filled with rubble almost like a tumbleweed.\nThe exchange was quick, but the eyes of the weremen lit up. Before, Leonel was like an insurmountable mountain to them, but he had suddenly become… human? How could they not take advantage of this?\n\"Quickly, before those damned Invalids get here. His ability must have a timer that ran out, this is our best chance!\"\nThe werehyena's speech sounded like cobbled growls and was hardly discernible. But, the werecheetah seemed to understand him, his power legs vibrating with power before he crouched and shot forward. Only the wererat stayed behind, his beady eyes narrowed.\nLeonel launched himself up, but quickly found himself on the back foot. Even the weakest of his senses, his eyes, was still far more powerful than the normal person. Not to mention realizing the trajectory of the attacks being launched at him, they even seemed slow in Leonel's eyes.\nBut every time, his body would be too slow to react. Like this, the spear that had once carried a foreboding of murder and blood became a normal stick that could only be used to block. In fact, if it wasn't for Leonel's dented shield, his spear would have been snapped in half a long time ago.\nLeonel felt exasperated. Hadn't he just killed two of them with absolute ease? Why was it suddenly so difficult?\n'… I thought I had great battle experience, but that's no more than a joke.'\nLeonel was continually pushed backward, his heart growing a bit anxious. He couldn't even remember the last time he launched an attack.\nIn the distance, the wererat's gaze turned toward the battle between Aina and the werewolf. Before, it had been one of incomparable ease for Aina, but now that her opponent was using Force while she was repressing her own, even she was forced to take him more seriously.\nTheir fists collided in dull booms, the savage aura coating Aina's body not dispelling even in the slightest. Even though blood slowly dripped from her hands, her ferocity only seemed to increase.\nThough the werewolf used his Force, Aina still didn't dare to do so. The man had only formed a single Force Node. Though it was possible to control Force output, that was only for those with high spirit. In comparison to her Force, Aina's own spirit could be considered as wholly lacking. She had no confidence in restraining her Force properly.\nThe kind of Invalids that would come for a person who had formed one Force Node and the kinds that would come for someone who had formed seven could be imagined.\nA powerful Invalid might come here if they were close for this werewolf, but if they were a distance away, they wouldn't bother. However, for Aina, even if it meant transferring to the ends of the earth and crossing the rivers of hell, they would make their way here without pause or rest.\nLike this, Aina had no choice. Her ability gave her great control over the state of her body, but when it came to Force… she was at a loss.\nSuddenly, Aina's eyes dulled and her movements turned sluggish. She didn't even realize what was happening when a fist had collided with her torso. It was so large in comparison to her body that her hips and ribs felt the impact all at once.\nSpittle flew from her mouth as all the air in her lungs was forcefully ejected. Glittering stars flew across her vision, dotting her sight in flashing lights and blurry hues.\nEven when she cratered into the remains of a home right by Leonel's former residence, she still had no idea what happened.\nLeonel's eyes widened. He wanted to rush over, but he simply couldn't break free out of the combined attacks of the werehyena and werecheetah. If he tried to force his way through, the result would likely be a serious injury on his part.\nHe grit his teeth. He thought he had reached some elevated status by clearing an S-grade Zone, but he failed to remember that most of the enemies he had faced were just normal humans. Their stats didn't even touch 0.50. Compared to Leonel, they were like infants waiting for slaughter.\nThe worst part was that even then, they had still almost done him in. If it wasn't for him grasping Joan's weakness at a critical point, he would have died that day in Paris and never returned.\nHowever, these opponents before him now might have had weaker stats than him, but they were still superhuman to the point he couldn't simply rely on his stronger body to defeat them.\n'What the hell happened? There's no way that werewolf is stronger than Aina.'\nLeonel's held head whipped back, his eyes landing on a wererat barely a meter and a half in height. Its gaze, too, had been moving away from Aina's battle and just so happened to meet Leonel's. Though his face seemed expressionless, the long whiskers on his ratlike face seemed to curl into a sneer along with his snout.\nAt those very same moments, the first Invalids had made their way to the crater. They swarmed from all directions. In the blink of an eye, there were three to four dozen of them.\nSeeing that he had heavily injured Aina, the werewolf immediately stopped using his Force and charged toward the collapsed building she had fallen into. But, while his efforts would stop more Invalids from converging, those that already had still far outnumbered them.\nOn Leonel's side of the battle, the wererat's gaze suddenly flashed with a blinding light that seemed to want to envelop Leonel completely just when the latter was about to turn his head away and go all out to stop the werewolf.\n'Your mind is too strong for me to influence normally, but to think you would actually dare meet my gaze. Die!'\nThe wererat snickered in his thoughts, an incorporeal sharp blade piercing toward Leonel. Unlike other fools, he had no intention of saying such words out loud. If Leonel wanted to understand his true ability… He could go ahead and ask those who preceded him in hell!",

      "content": ".[Will be changing DD's cover soon, keep that in mind]\nA familiar feeling of danger overwhelmed Leonel. It was as though this instinct had been subconsciously repressed by him but was bubbling forth, clawing its way out of the hidden depths of his mind.\nHowever, it was too late.\nLeonel couldn't see what it was that hit him. It was completely invisible. Yet, it felt as though a strong blast of air had assaulted his face.\nHis eyes watered, his head whipped back, and eventually, his gaze dulled like he was reminiscing on memories long since passed.\nSeeing Leonel's dazed expression, the werehyena and werecheetah didn't hesitate for even a moment. The former roared and opened his jaws wide, biting at Leonel's neck. The latter's right thigh bulged in size and grew by a fold, striking forward like a vicious whip that left whistling sounds hanging in the air.\nBANG! BANG!\nThe werecheetah's kick and the werehyena's bite landed as one. By all rights, Leonel's neck should have been bitten through while his lower body was sent flying. With the strength of the two weremen, his decapitation was almost guaranteed.\nBut, neither of them could have expected that a seemingly flimsy ray of blue light would stop them both.\nLeonel's body was sent flying, but the ones howling in pain wasn't him who was lost in a daze, but rather the werecheatah who had shattered his leg and the werehyena whose row of teeth were now broken.\nThe wererat's pupils constricted. 'Just what kind of treasure is that?'\nLeonel could have never expected that the treasure he picked out for the sake of self grooming would have such powerful defensive capabilities. But this was only natural. How could a Quasi Tier 1 Bronze treasure be so simple?\nSuddenly, the wererat felt an overwhelming sense of danger.\nHis beady eyes widened to find Leonel slowly standing up. However, this wasn't the shocking part. He had already expected this much after seeing the states of the two weremen.\nWhat truly shook him with fear was that… Leonel's savage expression had returned. The sight of him climbing back out of the rubble was akin to watching a devil climb up from the depths of hell.\nWhile Leonel had underestimated the defensive abilities of his self-grooming treasure, the wererat could have never imagined that knocking Leonel unconscious was the worst mistake he could have made… Because it allowed that demonic persona to come back.\nLeonel cackled as he dashed forward. One would have expected his laughter to sound like the devilish howls of a forsaken soul, but it didn't sound like this at all. Rather, he was like a child who had found a fun toy to play with, a little boy whose mental age couldn't have been more than five or six years old.\nHowever, despite this, his spear which had just been a flaccid, useless tool a moment ago, became a venomous viper.\nThe heads of the two whimpering beast men shot into the skies, completely separated from their bodies. In their pain, the last thing they could have expected was for Leonel to react so quickly and even counterattack them. No matter how you looked at it, it seemed like they weren't experienced in true combat.\nThe wererat panicked. With his guards gone, he suddenly had to face Leonel alone?\nThat strike he sent just now wasn't something he could send continuously. It would take at least another minute before he recovered enough normally. He had only been able to attack AIna and Leonel in quick succession like that because Aina's spirit was far weaker in comparison to him, so he hadn't needed to go all out.\nTo make matters worse… he somehow felt that even if he could launch another full powered strike toward Leonel, it wouldn't make a single bit of difference.\n\"Baruke! Get your ass over here!\"\nThe shrill cry of the wererat caused the werewolf who had been completely focused on digging up the pile of rubble to get to Aina to stop. He turned back to find the small wererat being dangled by his neck, his little feet swinging back and forth wildly.\nLeonel held the wererat's gaze up to his own. He seemed to be curiously staring into the wererat's beady eyes, as though trying to find the secret to something like a curious child.\nBaruke's eyes widened with shock and struggle. He couldn't decide whether to find and restrain Aina, or if he should hurry and save the wererat.\nIn the end, he grit his teeth and dashed forward. That weakling was the favorite test subject of that person, if he really dared to let him die here, only death would await him.\nFrom the moment Leonel fell into a daze, to the moment he clutched the wererat's neck, it could be said that not even ten seconds had passed. And, unfortunately, those ten seconds were more than enough time for the first Invalids to make their way down from the crater's edge.\nTheir dull, white eyes seemed to hold the depths of the universe.\nMany of them looked no different from normal humans. Those with low grade abilities tended to have small boosts to their speed or strength. As such. Low grade Invalids didn't normally have weird mutations amongst them.\nHowever, there were still three A-grade Invalids amongst the several dozen. If Leonel was conscious, he would have recognized these three as a part of the twelve A-grade Invalids listed to be here in Perimeter 7.\nOne had the slithery tongue and green scales of a poisonous snake. Another had skin that radiated a bright golden light that made the air around her sizzle. And the last had a head a fold in size larger than it should have been. This last one's head was completely bald, but had veins of blue crazily pumping across his forehead and head. Even its eyes were a size bigger than it should have been.\nBaruke seemed to think that it wouldn't be a problem to run from these Invalids, or maybe he was still too overconfident in his strength. If not for this, why would he so blatantly enrage a Variant? He must have really believed that he was invincible.\nHe wanted to rush toward Leonel, quickly deal with him, and run away with the wererat. However…\nCRACK.\nAs though bored and disappointed with a toy, Leonel tossed the wererat aside. The latter had widened its beady eyes as far as it could, and blood even dripped from their sockets, but it was to no avail.\n\"NO!\" Baruke roared, his swift yet massive figure appeared above Leonel with a leap.\nHe was finished. He really was finished. If he wanted a chance to live, how many more of those cruel experiments would he have to suffer through?\nIt was his fault. It was all his fault.\n\"DIE!\"\nBaruke's claws extended another several inches, slashing down toward Leonel.\nWith a playful smile, Leonel dropped the Metal Spirit's cube to the ground and slid his dented shield to his hand.\nHe gripped its edge tightly before sending it flying forward like a frisbee. Baruke could hardly react before the hard metallic edge smashed between his brows, leaving him dizzy and disoriented.\nThe last thing he felt before the light faded from his eyes was a sharp pain in his throat. His spine was cleanly severed and everything fell to darkness.\nLeonel crossed over Baruke's body like it wasn't worth much, he didn't even bother to pick up the fallen Metal Spirit. He had found much more interesting prey.\nHe licked his lips with excitement, watching on as the Invalids converged toward him.\nHis heart was budding with happiness. So many toys to play with.",

      "content": "[Seems like everything's fixed now, so here's the bonus chapter for 300 powerstones, next at 600 :)]\nLeonel's body was akin to an unleashed beast. Without the chains of morality or the burden of inexperience, he was like a well oiled machine, reaping the lives of one Invalid after another.\nThe large-headed A-grade Invalid seemed to be sending rays of mental attacks toward him, but they seemed to roll off of Leonel without the slightest hint of success. Without the ability to attack, this invalid was the first to fall.\nCompared to the large armies Leonel had faced, the Invalids were a loose pack of sand. They didn't work together and their intelligence seemed to be several levels lower than that of humans. With the level of Leonel's current battle sense… it was too easy.\nThe truth was that at this point, Leonel had already regained his senses. It was just that he was in a state of limbo. He felt like his body was a mech suit and his eyes were its windows. He was currently watching this mech suit being controlled by someone else, but through the lens of his own gaze.\nIt was a feeling that made him somewhat sick and lightheaded. The dizziness made him feel like he just might vomit any moment now, but due to the fact he wasn't controlling his body, he couldn't even if he wanted to.\nOf course, this wasn't to say that this was a forceful possession. In fact, Leonel knew that with a single thought, there would be no issue with him taking back control of his body.\nIt was this feeling that made him realize that this experience wasn't him being in danger… rather, it was an opportunity.\nStill, the more Leonel observed, the more incredulous it became. He could tell that the consciousness of this primitive man couldn't use power beyond the means of his body. But, he couldn't help but think… was this really his strength?\nLaughter left Leonel's lips as his head tilted to one side.\nA sharp tongue dripping in violet poison whizzed by his head, only to be caught in a hand of his covered by a thin blue light.\nHis arm bulged as he pulled with all his might, his spear wielding hand snaking forward.\nDING!\nThe stone blade rebounded off the forehead of the lizardman Invalid, but this only made Leonel's eyes brighten with even more excitement.\nThe angle of his wrist shifted and with a flick, the rebounded spear sliced the Invalid's tongue in two.\nIn that moment, the female Invalid surrounded by a heated golden radiance closed in. However, the heat emitting from her body charred the weaker Invalid's to dust, cutting down their number once more.\nShe grabbed toward Leonel who seemed to have not noticed her presence. But just before she made contact, she found a wall of green being thrown toward her.\nThe lizardman Invalid and female Invalid clashed, causing an exchange that left the latter on the losing end.\nShe was of the A-grade due to her uniquely high temperature Force, but her other stats were barely at the B-grade. It might have still been fine if all that happened was her clash with the lizardman Invalid, but how could she, with her dulled intelligence, be conscious enough to guess how insidious Leonel would be?\nUsing the disruption to her wall of Force caused by the lizardman, Leonel squeezed the blood and venom from the tongue in his hand onto his spear tip. With one swift motion, he attacked from the lizardman's back. The female Invalid couldn't even see the danger she was in before a cut not even a centimeter deep appeared on her thigh.\nThe two Invalids finally fell over, however in the blink of an eye, the two were incapacitated. One was paralyzed by poison while the other had had their entire frontside scorched, not to mention their pupils melted.\nAs though feeling this wasn't enough, Leonel appeared above them, grinning savagely as his foot stomped down onto their heads repeatedly. He was a complete madman, his laughter ringing out and echoing over the sunken walls of the large crater.\nAt that moment, the sound of shifting rubble caught Leonel's attention. He looked over to find Aina weakly pulling herself out from the collapsed home.\nAina too got her fair share of treasures, so of course she wouldn't lack a defensive treasure. The reason she had been out for such a long time was because the whiplash from suffering such a heavy blow had knocked her unconscious.\nIn order to match Baruke's 1.60 strength without activating her Force, she had been making use of several techniques and her battle sense, but how could she use either of those after the wererat sent her into a trance?\n\"Good… mate…\"\nLeonel spoke in a language Aina couldn't understand. In fact, even Leonel himself didn't understand the language, he could only vaguely sense that this primitive consciousness had some good feelings toward Aina, or else he could have stopped what happened next.\nAs though a man controlled by nothing but his love of fighting and his lust, Leonel pulled down his pants, revealing a rod that was quickly hardening.\nLet alone Aina, even the inner consciousness of Leonel himself could only stare blankly at what was happening. It was true that he could regain control of his body whenever he wanted, but the sudden change made all his thoughts go white.\nHow would he face Aina in the future like this?\nAina's gaze flickered from Leonel's proud face to a certain thing that was now standing at full mast. She still hadn't reacted by the time Leonel was standing before her akimbo as though waiting for her to reciprocate his actions.\nAfter a while, Aina seemed to realize something.\n\"… How do I wake him up…?\" She mumbled to herself. \"… I didn't expect to see that damned thing again so quickly…\"\nLeonel's consciousness went blank again. What the hell did she mean 'again'? And what was so 'damned' and 'thing-like' about his pride and joy?\nWait a minute, what did she mean by so quickly? Could it be that she would be alright with it if he was more patient?\nLeonel's mind wandered a bit more before he realized how ridiculous his thoughts were. There was a far more pressing concern here! How was he going to get out of this?",

      "content": "Leonel cleared his throat, taking back control of his body.\nPretending as though nothing had happened, he turned back and walked to his pants, put them on and looked into the distance.\n\"… Nice weather we're having today, right?\"\n\"…\"\n'He didn't hear what I said… right?\" Aina thought to herself.\nAina looked around and found where her ax had landed, trying to find something to distract herself from the awkward atmosphere. But, when she went to take a step forward, she suddenly stumbled and almost fell.\nHearing the sound of her tripping, Leonel quickly turned back and didn't hesitate to rush to her side.\n\"Are you alright?\"\nLeonel caught her arm, trying to make sure she stayed upright and didn't fall over.\n\"… I think I have a concussion.\" Aina said after a moment, bringing a hand to her forehead.\nThough she said it like this, she was already certain. Not to mention her ability, even if she hadn't awakened one, her Five Star Profession was more than enough for her to tell.\n\"How about the rest of your body, is it okay?\"\n\"… I'm fine.\"\nLeonel frowned. She was most definitely not fine.\nTaking a strike that powerful without putting up any defense would have been lethal for any normal human. It was already a miracle that she came out in one piece. A strength stat of 1.60, especially behind such a large fist, was more than enough to shatter every bone in her body. Had Baruke coordinated with the wererat and used his claws instead… Leonel didn't even want to think of the possibility.\n\"You don't have to lie to me, we're a team right now, aren't we?\" Leonel said.\n\"… We were a team in the France Zone too, but you still hid what that Force Art did to you, right?\"\nAina's glare made Leonel smile bitterly. He let go of her arm and scratched his nose, a bit of guilt welling up in his chest.\nHowever, this didn't change anything. Leonel could see by how gingerly she was moving that her effective stats were barely 70% of what they were meant to be. She might be able to hide her injuries from someone else, but Leonel's senses were too sharp. Even if by some miracle she didn't break any bones, she most definitely suffered from some internal bleeding.\n\"Alright, alright. I was wrong. But everything is okay now, right? I even got something out of it.\"\nIt was only now Leonel realized they never really resolved those matters. He never apologized to her and just kind of ignored the topic. It really did make him a bit of a hypocrite.\n\"Is it really fine?\"\n\"Yes, yes.\" Leonel crossed a hand over his chest as though swearing an oath. \"Even the scar has faded. It seems that whoever made the Force Art designed it to be used in the Third Dimension, so it lost its effects here.\"\nIn truth, this left Leonel feeling a bit disappointed. This Force Art was a double edged sword. The duller the danger, the less benefits he would receive.\nThe good news was that he could be considered to have solid fundamentals in Force Art now. The bad news was that all the Force Arts he knew, even if he drew them now, would have minimal effect at best and no effect at worst.\nThis was simply the laws of the universe. A Force Art designed to be used in a Fifth Dimensional World could likely destroy Earth in a single breath. But, one designed for a Third Dimensional one would have less of an impact that an ant.\nThose fireballs Leonel created to decimate the English would barely be enough to start a campfire here.\n'Well… At least I can use them in Zones? Not that I'll be able to enter one any time soon…' Leonel thought to himself.\nShaking his head, he came to once more. When he saw how Aina was still struggling to stand, he felt a pang in his heart.\nThat werewolf and wererat really got off easy.\n\"Let's return as quickly as possible.\" Leonel said firmly. \"You're in no state to continue staying in this place. And, there's no telling if they'll send another batch of them. I think they must have had a vehicle of their own to get here, we can see if we can use it to go back.\"\nAina frowned at Leonel's words, but she found it hard to refute.\n\"I'm sorry, I thought Yuri was exaggerating. I didn't really expect them to come and be so brazen…\"\nLeonel smiled and shook his head. \"Just find a place to sit and don't move around too much. I'm sure the keys are on one of them.\"\nThough Leonel said this casually, his mind was still churning.\nTo the Empire, characters like Aina and him were incredibly important. Yet, those six men brazenly tried to kill him. They didn't even hide their intentions.\nThis meant one of a few things, or potentially a combination of them.\nThe first was that Leonel had vastly overestimated the Empire's ability to monitor him. Maybe they still had technology, but not on a large enough scale to have no loopholes. In that case, the Brazinger family wouldn't be worried about their actions.\nThe second was that the Brazinger Clan didn't fear the Empire to begin with. This possibility made Leonel's blood run cold.\nThe third possibility was that the Brazinger family and the Empire were two halves of the same coin. It was possible that they moved forward and stepped back as one. In that case, the Empire might allow leeway to this family they didn't allow others.\nNo matter what the true reason was, the two of them were in danger. Somehow, those six were able to pinpoint their location and there was no guarantee that another group wouldn't be able to do it again.\nLeonel scanned the battlefield and eventually found the vehicle he was looking for. But, instead of leaving him with relief, it left him with a headache. Unlike the natural gas jeep they rode here, this vehicle was worthy of their 25th century.\nIt was a sleek shuttle that almost looked like a pod if not for its two fins. Leonel had no confidence in driving it.\nHe had been able to observe the Tier 3 Officials, so he had been somewhat eager to drive the jeep. But, who was he going to observe now?\nThough Leonel was a bit hesitant, he took out the dictionary his father left him. For now, their lives were more important. If he was questioned about its existence later, there were several excuses he could come up with.\n\"How do you fly this thing?\" Leonel asked.\nThankfully, by some miracle, the dictionary had an answer. However, the method by which he found an answer left his eyes burning with passion.\nNot unlike how it scanned Leonel previously, it also began to scan the shuttle. Only then did it output an answer.\n[ *Ping* Vehicle recognized as Air Shuttle Model X290. It is advised that Seed make use of autopilot feature. ]\n'It can scan things like this… I don't think dad would have filed in information like this, which means it analyzed and drew conclusions. It probably found the shuttle's name after scanning its operating software… Does that mean that this is the Zone Analysis treasure I thought that old man didn't leave me?'\nThinking to this point, Leonel sighed a breath of relief.\nNot even allowing Aina to resist, he picked up his things and swept her into his arms after finding the shuttle key on the wererat's body.\nHe seemed to be rushing without cause, but in a hidden place on Earth, an event was playing out that proved his actions to be the most logical.\nA young man sat before several monitors with a monocle over his left eye. Actually, one would be hard pressed to call it a monocle at all. It had eight lenses that seemed to hover in space in a circular formation. Countless bits of information flew by, causing his left eye to flicker from time to time. Yet, his right remained trained on the monitors before him.\n'The life signatures of rat 006 flatlined as well…'\nThe young man's eyes narrowed.",

      "content": "Leonel gazed out of the shuttle windows with a serious expression. Even though they were now traveling several times faster than they had been in the jeep, the uneasy feeling in his heart refused to let up.\nThe shuttle was large and spacious. After all, it had carried six men to this place. Thanks to this, Aina was able to lie in the back, trying to get a grip on her injuries.\nAs for Leonel, he sat at the front, his wooden spear laying across his lap. However, the current spear was unlike it had been before.\nThough it had been crude already, the current primitive spear was on the verge of collapse. It was cracked in many places and seemed it would splinter under the tiniest bit of force.\nLeonel had a vague feeling that the moment the spear broke, he wouldn't be able to enter that state again…\n'I need to remain calm. Panicking isn't going to help me.'\n\"Is there a GPS signal coming from this shuttle? If so, how do I turn it off?\" Leonel asked.\nHe didn't know much about shuttles or cars, but what he did know was that if he could have this shuttle autopilot to a destination, it meant it had a GPS of some sort. In that case, it might very well be communicating with a larger hub. If that larger hub sent information about their whereabouts, it would only bring them more trouble.\nThough the shuttle was far faster than the jeep, it would still take an estimated one hour to make it back to the Fort. That was long enough for a lot of things to happen.\n[ *Ping* Yes. With Seed's current abilities, the only way to disengage this signal is by disassembling the shuttle. ]\nLeonel felt a headache coming along. Disassemble such a high level shuttle? He wasn't an Engineering Professional. Plus, if he did, wouldn't that mean he would have to stop the shuttle? That option was even worse.\n'There's no other option.' Leonel's jaw clenched, his gaze narrowing. 'I've overestimated myself too much, compared to Aina, my combat sense is too poor. Without this spear, I would be finished. But, not only is it going to break soon, but my spirit still hasn't recovered from the first time, so I can't enter and take another spear… There's not even a guarantee that the next spear will be as useful as this one…'\nLeonel's brows became locked in a furrow.\nIf it wasn't for his depleted spirit, even if the wererat made eye contact with him, he wouldn't have lost consciousness like that — though it helped him in the end.\nHis depleted spirit also made him realize another thing: he was entirely reliant on his ability.\nWith his spirit fatigued, his ability to calculate and make plans had taken a massive dip. With that, his combat prowess took an ever deeper dip downward. In addition, his coordination and reflexes suffered, while his Internal Sight had been limited…\n'I can't fix all of these problems in a short time.'\n\"Is there any way for me to recover my spirit quickly?\" Leonel asked.\nThis was his only chance. He had to allow his ability to regain its peak performance as quickly as possible. Then, he could make use of Dream World to dissect the things he learned from that primitive consciousness as quickly as possible. Even if they were headed toward the Fort at blazing speed now, he had no confidence in making it in time.\nAnd… he had a sinking feeling that even if they did, it wouldn't matter.\n[ *Ping* It has been deduced that Seed is practicing [Dimensional Cleanse] and has formed a One Star Cleansed Body. Optimal route to recovery is to circulate [Dimensional Cleanse]. ]\nLeonel's expression became weird.\n\"[Dimensional Cleanse] is a Force technique. It shouldn't affect spirit. Why is this the optimal route?\"\nCirculating [Dimensional Cleanse] might as well be like putting up a beacon that cried out \"I'm here, come get me now!\". Leonel couldn't blindly follow the dictionary if this was really its plan, or else they would die long before they had a chance.\nLeonel hadn't seen all of the abilities of the world yet. But, he didn't dare to assume that there was no ability capable of knocking them out of the sky. As such, he didn't dare circulate his Force so brazenly.\nUnlike Baruke, he had formed three Force Nodes. In addition, his Nodes were far larger than the norm. If he really did this, let alone the nine remaining A-grade Invalids of this Perimeter 7, Invalids from other Perimeters would likely charge here at their fastest possible speed.\n[ *Ping* The term 'spirit' is unrecognized. By context, it is likely that Seed is referring to Internal Sight also known by some as Soul Force. Calculating response… ]\nIf it wasn't for the situation, Leonel might have blushed. He almost forgot that 'spirit' was just a term he randomly made up for the sake of measuring the comprehensive stats of his enemies.\n[ *Ping* Responding to Seed, [Dimensional Cleanse] is indeed a Force technique. The ability to recover Soul Force is a product of the One Star Cleansed Constitution. The Star, located in the Ethereal Glabella, has the effect of explosively increasing 'spirit' and clearing the mind. ]\nHearing these words, Leonel finally understood. It wasn't Force impacting his spirit, but rather a product of Force, the Star, that did.\nLeonel's lips pursed into a thin line. It seemed he would have to take some risks.\nWith a deep breath, his eyes focused once more, a familiar pressure billowing from his body. A fiery light hid behind his pale green eyes, growing in strength with each passing second.\nAt that moment, Invalids for several miles all looked in a single direction.\nLike a typhoon, Force spun into a cyclone and charged toward Leonel's body. Those who could sense Force felt as though the world was quaking. As for those who hadn't awakened their Internal Sight… an unease crept into their hearts.\nTo them, a subtle sense of inferiority latched onto their souls.\nThe shuttle creaked and groaned. It seemed the Force was badly influencing its internals. But, Leonel pretended as though he didn't notice its bobbing and swaying in the air.\nHe felt as though someone had locked their sights onto him, as though there was something lurking in the shadows, waiting to pounce… A dangerous warning far greater than the wererat was blaring in his mind.",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 600 powerstones. Next at 900 :) ]\nFor the first time, Leonel felt the might of his One Star Cleansed Constitution.\nAccording to the creator of [Dimensional Cleanse], just the act of forming his First Star was enough for him to be ranked in the top 1% of talent. Of course, 1%, even on Earth, constituted tens of millions of people before the Metamorphosis began, let alone the fact that the creator was likely referring to a multiverse of people. However, this still meant that out of a hundred people, Leonel would be the very best amongst them.\nStill, though Leonel had read the words of the creator, he had thought it was an exaggeration. What was so difficult about forming three Force Nodes and forming the First Star? To him, it was as easy as breathing. So, he had thought that that narcissistic creator who had been bragging about his own technique was just exaggerating.\nBut, Leonel couldn't have been more wrong.\nWhat he didn't know was that the frame of reference the creator used wasn't a mere Third Dimensional world evolving into the Fourth like Earth at all. Even the dictionary Leonel's father left recognized the technique as exceptionally high grade. The only reason Leonel could even see a piece of it like this is because the part in his hands was the mere first part of many, as for the later parts, he was nowhere near qualified to trade for them.\nWhat Leonel needed to understand was that forming the First Star wasn't just about creating three Force Nodes. This was simply a minimum requirement. There were many who formed even all nine Fundamental Nodes while failing to form even one Star!\nAll of this led to Leonel vastly underestimating himself. Not only was [Dimensional Cleanse] a great Force cultivation technique, it was practically the perfect technique for him.\nLeonel found that when he circulated [Dimensional Cleanse] in full force, his mind was clearer than it ever had been before.\nHis Internal Sight blossomed and he could vaguely feel that he had entered a new world. This world was somehow both less material than Earth, but more material than his Dream World. It was an in between kind of space that left him feeling light headed but comfortable at the same time.\nAll sorts of conflicting sensory feedback assaulted his mind. He felt weightless, but heavy, that the space was infinite in size, yet as small as a pebble, like up was down and down was up.\nThe only thing that seemed to make sense was a singular floating star above his head. Like an anchor, it silently pulsed in the sky, radiating a pure white light as it slowly revolved. It was only when Leonel focused on it that everything in his mind grew calm once more.\n'This… is the Ethereal Glabella the dictionary spoke of?'\nLeonel felt a subtle control over the Star. The slower it rotated, the weaker the streams of Force entering him would become. The faster he egged it on, the thicker the invisible lines of Force would become.\nA portion of the Force would enter his body and nourish him, subtly increasing his stats. Another portion would nourish the star itself, causing it to pulse. Every pulse would refresh his mind, recovering his spirit several times faster than normal.\nUnder normal conditions, it would take about three hours for Leonel to recover his spirit if he took a nap. If he didn't and simply let it recover in his wakeful state, it would take six. But now he felt just half an hour was enough!\nIf that was the case, what would the result be when he formed his Second Star? Or the penultimate Third? Even if the effect was only additive, the benefits would be unimaginable.\nA large part of the reason it took him almost 24 hours to Dream Sculpt Joan's polearm was precisely due to lack of spirit. But now…\n'Thirty minutes is still not fast enough…' Leonel took a deep breath. '… I can't wait for it to finish, I need to try and use the incoming replenishment at the same time.'\nLeonel's thoughts were impossibly immature. If others knew that he was attempting to circulate a Force technique while distracted, their only conclusion would be that he was courting death.\nIn truth, Leonel wasn't so naive. He knew that Force and that manipulation of it was dangerous. He learned as much studying [Call of the Wind]. However, the uncomfortable feeling in his heart only grew greater and greater, it was like hundreds of tiny ants gnawing at his heart.\nNo matter what he tried, he simply couldn't calm down.\nLeonel could vaguely feel that this was the instinct of the primitive man. He could smell the danger lurking with a nose refined over decades in the jungle. Since he was so certain it was coming, Leonel knew it couldn't have been baseless.\n'Dream World.'\nLeonel stretched his ability's computation prowess to its limits, madly accepting the Force that poured into his body.\nOne half of his mind remained in the Ethereal Glabella while the other entered a blank white space that looked like an insane asylum ward. Leonel had no choice but to keep the surroundings as bland as possible, he couldn't spare thoughts toward anything superficial.\nHe began to run simulations. No, it was more accurate to say that he was replaying every action the primitive consciousness took while it had control of his body. Every step, every strike, every twitch of the muscle.\nHe ran the simulation again and again as though trying to sear it into his mind.\nSweat poured from his forehead, but he didn't spare the effort to wipe it away.\nTime dilated.\nOne could think far faster than they could act. Leonel's simulations broke what would have been normal pacing under his agitation. The movements of his Dream World avatar grew quicker and quicker, but since it all occurred in Leonel's mind, it felt to him that nothing had changed.\nAina laid behind Leonel, watching his back slowly drown in sweat. Though she knew what he was doing was dangerous, she didn't stop him. Instead, she was focused on her own recovery.\n'One isn't enough…' Leonel's jaw clenched tighter.\nHe felt that at this speed, it would take him three days to fully digest the combat ability of the primitive consciousness and a full week before he could translate it to use in his true body. However, he didn't have this kind of time, he really didn't.\nIf other owners of the Spear Domain ring knew of this, they would definitely faint from shock. Let alone completing such a task in a week, many past owners of the ring never succeeded in fully digesting a 'Spear Consciousness', at least not on their first try. And, even when they did succeed, it was only with the spears they had the highest compatibilities with and only after several months and even years.\nNot only was this primitive consciousness the polar opposite of Leonel, he even said he could fully digest its insights in just three days! It was completely ridiculous.\nIt could only be said that Leonel's ability was perfectly suited for Spear Domain. So perfectly suited it was enough to make others green with envy.\nLike a madman, Leonel's Dream World suddenly gained two shadows.\nHe stripped the avatars bare of everything. They wore no clothes, they wore no expressions, in fact, they had no faces at all! Leonel stripped them of everything that would waste his computation ability, even taking their Force Nodes away.\nThe fact the man was so primitive was a blessing in disguise for Leonel. Because of this, everything about his fighting capability was firmly rooted in the Third Dimension, making it much easier for Leonel to simulate his fighting style.\nThe bad news was that this meant the simulations didn't teach Leonel how to make the best use of his Force, but Leonel couldn't afford to be picky anymore.\n'Two isn't enough!'\nA third shadow appeared. This one was even less detailed than the first two. At best, it could only be considered a stick figure. Without muscles, its simulation was even less accurate. But Leonel threw everything he had at the wall, burning his limits to the very edge of what they were capable of.\nBlood dripped from his nose and his face paled, but his expression was without change. He had returned to the Leonel on the football field, the Leonel taking a pop quiz, the Leonel who would take even the simplest of tasks with the utmost seriousness.\nIt was at that moment that it happened.\nSSSSKKKKRRRRREEEEEEEEEEE\nThe sound of sharp, whistling wind and the screech of a beast resounded through the skies.\nA massive tentacle stretched up taller than even the wreckage of skyscrapers and slammed down with all its might onto the silver shuttle.",

      "content": "Leonel's eyes flashed open.\nHis reaction was impossibly quick. With swift movements, he darted to the back of the shuttle, swooped Aina up, and jumped from the opposing door.\nTheir free fall would have led to the deaths of even evolved humans who had awakened their abilities. After all, the shuttle had a maximum elevation of 20 meters from the ground. But, Leonel was prepared.\n\"Aina, your rope.\"\nEven as the fell from the skies, Leonel's gaze held a hidden sharpness. Falling from a tall height? That was what he feared the least. How many times had he done this exact same thing just on a single journey to school?\nWith a heavy boom, Leonel landed on a fallen building. Due to his preparedness, the fall was barely five meters.\nAt that time, the tentacle viciously whipped against the shuttle, crumbling an entire side of it with unstoppable momentum.\nLeonel's pupils constricted.\nAs though a ball accepting the swing of a bat, the shuttle deformed and rocketed away at a speed almost faster than its forward momentum.\nLeonel felt his teeth getting itchy. What the hell kind of power is this? If he assumed the shuttle weighed a few tons, that was still a vast underestimation. If that was taken into account with its forward impetus… Just how much strength did it take to make it deviate like that?\nLuckily, the forward momentum wasn't entirely disrupted. The shuttle spun and flew into the distance, missing Leonel and Aina by a large measure.\nIt was only now that Leonel got a good glance at just what had attacked them.\nThe tentacle was massive. Just the portion Leonel could see was over 20 meters in length. The rest of it was hidden behind the building it had attacked from the back of. However, this alone was enough to make Leonel's heart quake.\nA strong fishy smell came from it, marring the air with a combination of a salty sea smell and a disgusting, rotting odor. A sticky, viscous liquid dripped, hitting the ground in intermittent intervals.\nEvery inch of the bottom of the tentacle was filled with suction cups. They were each more than double or even triple the size of Leonel's head. They all vibrated in a rhythm that made it seem like they were breathing. And, judging by the destruction they caused to the shuttle… they definitely weren't as soft as they seemed either.\nAs though on cue, the shuttle landed heavily on the ground. The resulting explosion was deafening. Even the buildings beneath Leonel's feet shifted as though they might collapse into a further heap once again.\nA ring of hot air blasted into Leonel, making him feel as though his skin would be burnt to a crisp at any moment.\nIt was then that Aina finally handed him the rope he asked for, the very same rope they had made use of to climb the castle walls in Paris. Without hesitation, he swung her to his back, tying her firmly to him with an unquestionable aura emanating from him.\nAt his current physical level, Leonel's body was far stronger than a horses. In that case, since a horse could carry one and even two passengers at times, how could Aina's petite figure do anything to stop him anymore? In fact, he only barely felt the weight of her family Heirloom that was now strapped to her own back.\n'It hasn't launched a follow up attack in quick succession. It's likely that it still believes we're in the shuttle, which also means that its vision is either poor or obscured — let's assume the second to be safe.\n'No matter what the answer, it ultimately means that it locked onto us using my Force as a guide. Which means its likely uncertain of our exact location now that I've stopped circulating [Dimensional Cleanse].'\nLeonel's thoughts revolved madly. Though he had used his spirit as quickly as it formed just now, he still managed to recover a bit — about 40%. He now knew that the recovery of spirit wasn't uniform. He could recover it much quicker when he was fatigued, but the recovery became slower after 50%, and even slower above 80%.\nThankfully, this worked in his favor. As long as his spirit wasn't below 20% recovery, he wouldn't feel lethargic and his ability could work without shackles.\nLeonel broke out into a run after handing the Metal Spirit to Aina to hold. At the moment, the only things in his hands were the primitive spear and the dented shield on his left arm.\nThe sound of breaking rumbling and collapsing buildings sounded behind Leonel. He didn't need to look back to know that whatever monster that thing was had definitely knocked the building in its way over to get to the shuttle it had knocked down from the skies.\nLeonel didn't bother to look over his shoulder. Even if he did, with Aina's body and her ax in his way, he wouldn't be able to see anything anyway.\nSSSKKKKRRRRREEEEEE\nLeonel clenched his jaw tightly, leaping from building remnant to building remnant. He could feel the muscles in his body madly heating up, but he had no mind to pay to them. He focused entirely on increasing his efficiency, on tapping into the mind of the primitive man and controlling his body as he had controlled his.\nHe knew that that thing's cry was due to finding out that its prey had escaped. If he delayed by looking back at it… he would only be courting death.\n'Dammit, there are other Invalids here…'\nLeonel's gaze flashed, finding an Invalid with a massive upper body blocking his path forward. Its legs were far too small in proportion to its figure, making it look like a human gorilla. But, Leonel didn't have the mind to laugh because he could sense the incredible power radiating in those massive forearms and fists.\nHe spared a glance toward his spear and felt a pang in his heart. It looked like it would only survive a few more exchanges. He didn't want to waste them on an A-grade Invalid. To others, an A-grade Invalid already meant death. But to him, the current situation slotted them in as canon fodder.\n\"Use my ax.\" Aina suddenly said.\nLeonel agreed to the suggestion without hesitation. He put the primitive spear away into his spatial bracelet, accepting the ax Aina handed to him.\nA blazing aura erupted from Leonel. Though he didn't think much of it, Aina's eyes widened.\n'I thought I would have to suppress it so that he could use it freely. But…'\nThough the werewolf seemed to have been using Aina's ax without issue, this wasn't the case. In fact, the ax was more than ten times heavier in his hands than it was in Aina's. In addition, it wouldn't smoothly accept his Force either, or why else would Aina defeat him so easily without employing her own Force and even while being bare handed?\nHowever, the Brazinger Clan's Heirloom didn't resist Leonel in the slightest.\nThere were only two explanations. Either it trusted Leonel unconditionally or it had accepted him as its inheritor just like it had Aina. The second could be thrown out, which meant that it was more definitely the former.\nAnd since that was the case, there was only one explanation: it meant that she trusted him unconditionally.\nAina couldn't help but blush when her thoughts reached this point.\nThe fibers of Leonel's muscles vibrated as one. His expression remained calm, almost cold. He was completely unlike the primitive man who loved battle. To Leonel, there was nothing but objective calculation.\nThe A-grade Invalid roared, wildly beating its chest before raising its fists high in the air and smashing toward Leonel.\nLeonel didn't even blink.\nAs though a carbon copy of the primitive man, his hips flexed, his thighs bulged, and his toes seemed as though they might rip out from his treasure shoes at any moment. He held onto the ax with both hands, exerting all his might.\nBANG!\nA small circle of air was left where Leonel's feet were last. He shot forward explosively, appearing behind the A-grade Invalid in less than the blink of an eye.\nHis breathing was already ragged as though that move had taken everything out of him, but the head of the Invalid flew into the air, leaving its roar swaying in the wind.\nLeonel didn't even look back. He broke out into a sprint. As long as he could leave this jungle of buildings, he could pull out his bike. By then, his speed would increase by 50% and he would have a better chance at escaping the range of that ridiculous beast.\nBut it seemed that nothing in his life would go the easy way.\nSSSKKKKKRRRRREEEEEEEEE\nBANG! BANG!\nLeonel didn't turn back, but he could sense what happened with his Internal Sight.\nA tentacle stretched into the skies and whipped downward toward the ground.\nIts suction cups bulged and became like dozens of obscenely powerful springs. They rebounded off the ground, launching the creature into the air.\nThe sky seemed to go dark. A massive shadow covered the land, making Leonel feel as though the world had descended into darkness.\nFinally, he couldn't hold back anymore and looked back. Without Aina's ax in the way, his field of vision was much wider. And, what he saw sent shivers down his spine.\nIt was massive. An enormous eight tentacled beast almost 50 meters from one tip of a tentacle to another.\nAnd… it was descending from the skies and falling down toward him.",

      "content": "[... I don't even want to know how you guys hit 900 powerstones so quickly...]\n\"… Holy shit.\"\nThese were the only words Leonel could say. He had never seen such a scene in his lifetime. The sight was so shocking that he didn't even have the mind to pay attention to the stomach churning scent.\nIn that moment, the world seemed to slow to a crawl. Leonel's pupils flickered continuously, his mind running several calculations at once.\nA split second later, he dropped into a low squat, jumping almost five meters into the air.\nIf someone was watching this scene, they would think he had lost his mind. Such a jumping height was indeed impressive in comparison to a normal human. More than impressive, in fact. It was simply inhuman.\nHowever, it did him absolutely no good. What was five meters to a monster so large? Not to mention the fact… Leonel was jumping right toward it!\nThe resolution in Leonel's eyes didn't fade. Just when his body was about to lose its upward momentum, the sole of his right foot erupted with a bright green light, causing a square platform of just over a foot in length to appear.\nLeonel's thigh bulged as small measures of Force erupted from his leg, sending him another over ten meters into the air.\nHis pupils constricted.\n'I miscalculated. I didn't account for the fact these platforms could also increase my leaping ability. I'll reach that point 0.2 seconds faster than I calculated, but I'll also be able to save a platform jump.'\nLeonel's gaze carried a steely coldness, a hidden blazing green light crouching behind like a lurking beast.\nHis body soared through a gap in the beast's tentacles, appearing above its falling form in a flash.\nAs expected, the creature hadn't reacted to him until it was too late. This was exactly why he hadn't used his Force for his first jump. This way, the creature wouldn't be able to lock onto him too soon.\nHowever, what Leonel couldn't have imagined was that the moment he appeared 'above' the creature, he would be faced with a massive eye the size of his body, gazing at him with murderous intent.\nOne figure rising, the other descending.\nFor a moment, it seemed that time had stopped. A cold sweat matted Leonel's back. He felt that if this creature had a mental attack like the wererat… he really wouldn't be able to resist it this time.\nBOOM! SKKKRRREEEEEEEEEEEEE\nThe beast landed on the ground, immediately launching several tentacles toward Leonel who was above its bulbous head.\nMany years after this, Leonel would still cry tears about this battle. Even after so much time passed, he wouldn't know how he got so unlucky to have an octopus attack him on land.\nThat massive round head, those weird S-shaped eyes, those tentacles… After seeing the top of its body, it was undeniable.\nNow, he was certain that this octopus's vision was only obscured before. He had taken a marine biology class in the past only because Aina took it. They had vision sharper than even humans. And, who knew what kind of mutations had appeared afterward. This creature's vision might very well be even better than the norm.\nLeonel didn't have time to think anymore about it. He had thought of blinding it, but he completely gave up on the idea. Not only was it too dangerous, but it might not even be useful.\nNormal octopuses had complex sensors on their tentacle suction cups. It was appropriate to assume that the senses of this octopus had evolved, or how else could it have accurately swatted a shuttle moving at 300 kilometers an hour with a single tentacle all while its vision was obscured? And, how else had it locked onto him again despite how far he had run away without activating his Force?\nAt that point, Leonel felt that he was incredibly lucky he had thought ahead enough to not use his Force on his initial jump.\n'The tentacles of normal octopuses can touch and smell. These evolved tentacles can likely also sense Force. In that case...'\nLeonel's left shoes glowed a bright green light before he leaped with all his might to the right.\nHis instantaneous speed was blinding. He left streaks in the air, barely managing to leap over the tentacle that was sweeping toward him. He had already calculated the longest reach of the octopus after it attacked the shuttle. He wouldn't forget such an important tidbit at such a time.\nLeonel landed on the top of a dilapidated building, his feet sliding across its roof.\n'58 second cool down on the right. We were ten minutes away from the Fort according to the shuttle. That's 50 kilometers. There's no way I can cross such a distance with this thing hounding me. It's destructive capability is too great and it isn't even hampered by speed with that insane jumping ability. Its agility is also covered thanks to its eight tentacles…\n'… I need to kill it.'\nLeonel's jaw clenched as he jumped from the building without hesitation.\nSSSKKKRRRREEEEEEE\nThe building collapsed. Leonel had hardly leapt from it when the octopus flattened it to the ground. However, even it could not imagine that Leonel would actually jump back down toward it.\nLeonel knew that running would put him at a disadvantage. His best chance to run was right after the shuttle had been destroyed when this thing had yet to lock onto him. But, who knew it would find him again so quickly?\nIf he tried to run now, he would fall victim to that jumping attack again. If he was unlucky enough to get caught before the cool down of his shoes ended, he would be finished.\nThis wasn't even the worst possibility. With how monstrous this thing was, knocking down buildings like they were houses of cards, Leonel just might get flattened to death just by its attempts at chasing him.\nIn that case, his best choice was to stay close to it.\n\"Can you scan this thing and tell me its power, abilities and weakness?\" Leonel yelled as he fell from the top of the building toward the octopus.\nHe was shooting a shot in the dark. But, if this thing could scan a shuttle it didn't have in its database, and even potentially scan Zones, maybe it could do this too…?\nFinally, it seemed someone was smiling down upon Leonel.\n[ *Ping* Evolved marine life form detected. ]\n[Kingdom: Animalia]\n[Phylum: Mollusca]\n[Class: Cephalopoda]\n[Order: Octopoda]\n[Superfamily: Octopodidae ]\n[Family: Megaleledonidae]\n[State: Evolved]\n[ Abilities: … *Ping* Generating nomenclature… ]\n[ Reinforced Suction Cups: Can alternate between softness and hardness.

The space around him became like a billowing hurricane, ripping the wind around him apart.\nHis hair danced, the hidden green light in his eyes blazing to life.\nThis damned octopus was actually an S-grade monster. But that was fine.\nShackles that usually held Leonel back were released in full force. He might foolishly hesitate against a human.

      "content": "Force howled around Leonel's body. A towering aura surged from him, causing the octopus to hesitate. Its tentacles continuously twitched as though sensing something more monstrous than itself was standing before it.\nFrom its vantage point, it could barely see Leonel. Its eyes were too high and Leonel was too short. Such a bug should have been all too easy to kill. So, why was it feeling like this?\nAina laid on Leonel's back, her breathing incredibly steady. Though every time Leonel made a sudden movement, she would feel a jolting pain rampage across her body, she hadn't had the slightest change in expression, nor had she made the slightest sound.\nBut now, she was surprised once more. This form of intimidation was so potent.\n'… However… He isn't yet strong enough to boast such an aura… After a while, the beast will just be more infuriated…'\nSSSSSSKKKRRRREEEEEEEEEEE\nAina had hardly finished her thoughts when the roars of the octopus shook the surroundings once more.\nThe two tentacles closest to Leonel slammed toward him. Due to the size of the octopus, Leonel could only stand between the two of them.\n\"Pour your Force into the ax.\" Aina quickly said. \"It has one main ability that can be used now, you've seen it before.\"\nLeonel hadn't needed Aina to tell him this. He was already prepared.\nHis Force surged, causing the red glow of the battle ax to grow several times. An illusory blade extended from the ax's edge, expanding the size of the weapon by several fold.\n\"Ha!\"\nA roar left Leonel's lips.\nHis body flexed as one. His Force was wild, but his muscles churned in a controlled rage as he swung down with all his might.\nThe extended blade pierced into the right tentacle by several meters, but failed to make it all the way through.\nAt that time, the mournful howl of the octopus was followed by the strike of its second tentacle which lashed against Leonel's back.\nThere was nothing in this world that would have allowed Leonel to let such a thing happen. After all, Aina was on his back and she was already injured. How could she suffer such a strike?\nThe moment he realized he didn't have the strength to sever the tentacle in one strike, he immediately executed his secondary plan.\nAs though the massive ax was the hook of a rock climber, he pulled down hard, making use of the octopus's tough skin as an anchor to launch himself up and above the second strike.\nLeonel landed on the top of the half severed tentacle, his steps faltering. He hadn't accounted for just how slippery the skin of the octopus would be and his feet were almost swept out from beneath him.\nBANG!\nThe second tentacle landed on the first, having failed to squash Leonel between them like pincers. But, the impact caused Leonel, who had just barely regained his footing, to falter once more. And this time, he couldn't regain it in time.\n'Dammit!'\nLeonel fell to the side, the enraged and pained roars of the octopus playing as the backdrop to his clown show.\nSeeing that Leonel was now within striking range of its third tentacle, the maddened beast didn't hesitate to swing toward Leonel's falling figure.\nLeonel's mind spun hard and his gaze flashed.\n'Since it's like this, don't blame me for taking advantage!'\nStaying on top of its tentacle was too dangerous, even if it was a tentacle that he had just severely injured. If this beast grit its way through the pain, launching Leonel into the air with a casual flick would basically guarantee his death.\nLeonel knew how risky this would be before he did it, which is why he tested to see if he could sever a tentacle first. After he was forced to take such a risk, he wanted to run toward the octopus's head as quickly as possible. After all, even though this monster was large, it was still only 50 meters from edge to edge, and the distance from one tip of the tentacle to its head was barely 20 meters. In that case, Leonel could still cover the distance in time.\nBut, who knew this damned thing would be so slippery even to the point where he, who boasted maybe the highest coordination stat on Earth, stumbled around like a newborn calf?\nIt should have been hopeless, he should have been finished. But, Leonel's gaze was burning as bright as two torches in the depths of the night.\nWithout hesitation, Leonel raised the ax once more, slicing into the already injured tentacle he was falling from without hesitation.\nIn one swift motion, he stopped his falling and used the ax as a hook once more, launching him forward at blinding speeds.\nLeonel was a madman. As though the slippery liquid coating the octopus was a surfboard and its body was an ocean, he slid across it, leaving afterimages in his wake.\nThe octopus's tentacle missed, lashing against its own injured limb once again.\nIt couldn't grasp how it could accurately knock a ship flying in the air at 300 kilometers an hour, yet couldn't swat this annoying fly to death. It had yet to evolve to the point of understanding that hitting something going in a straight line with a predestined path was far easier than hitting something which adapted to the situation like a feather drifting in the wind.\nHowever, Leonel still had a price to pay. He needed speed. He practically thirsted for it.\nHe was using his Force to the limits, not to mention the fact his body was already reaching its limits. He couldn't afford to stay here any longer. Who knew if there was another monster like this lumbering toward him now?\nBut, most importantly, he needed to glide across the tentacle as quickly as possible. So… He left Aina's ax embedded into this thing's skin.\nLeonel, like a streaking flash, careened toward the octopus's head. However, he wasn't as weaponless as one would expect. Instead, a primitive spear had appeared in his hand, his aura rising and billowing in the air.\nHis blood boiled, a seething excitement bubbling forth from its depths. But, Leonel couldn't afford to let the primitive consciousness possess him this time. Right now… Only he could do this.\nThe octopus felt the looming danger. It tried to lift its injured tentacle to launch Leonel away, but by the time it did, Leonel was already near the end of it. So… Though Leonel was sent flying… It was right toward the center of its head!\nTo the octopus, Leonel was like a god of death descending from the skies. The murderous intent was enough to make the beast freeze. For a moment, it really couldn't tell which of them was meant to be the true monster.\nIn its panic, the octopus launched everything it had at Leonel, not minding its head as all eight of its tentacles bent backward and toward the demon in the skies headed for it.\nThe first time Leonel used [Call of the Wind] with his spear, he had only formed one Force Node. The last time he used it, the Force Art on his hand was restricting how much Force he could use.\nBut now… he had no such restrictions.\nThe spear in his hand vibrated wildly, but his hand was like a steel clamp, holding it down as the light in his eyes grew brighter and brighter.\n'[Call of the Wind]!'\nThe wind around Leonel's spear tip grew so wild that it could be seen with the naked eye, a violent cyclone concentrated into a single point.\nThe moment Leonel pierced forward, his primitive spear burst into a rain of shrapnel. But, the attack stayed true, tearing through the air toward the octopus's head.\nSSSSSSKKKKKRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEE\nThe world was silent for a moment. It seemed as though Leonel's final strike had done nothing.\nHowever, an instant later, the center of the octopus's head began to twist. Then, its tough skin ruptured, following the twisting pattern and ripping itself apart.\nThe twisting tunneled through, its speed picking up. At first, everything seemed to slow to a crawl, but in the next moment, it accelerated. It seemed to take several seconds for the first layer of skin to be pierced, but in the blink of an eye, a torrent of wind had exited from the back of the octopus's head.\nA mournful cry left the massive monster, the last of its tentacles lashing toward Leonel as a final, desperate plea.\nIn the air, Leonel had no way to dodge. The cool down on his shoes still hadn't ended. And, even if it had, he wasn't sure he had any Force left to activate them. He had put everything he had into that last strike.\nThis wasn't the most important point either. Even if his chain necklace could save him from dying, what about Aina who was strapped to his back?\nLeonel's fighting intent blazed as he fell from the skies, the last bits of his strength blooming forth.",

      "content": "Leonel really did feel like an unlucky star was following him around everywhere.\nThe reason he dared to jump into the skies like this despite knowing the octopus might make an all out last assault was because he was hoping that it would disappear after it died just like Invalids. In that case, there would be nothing to worry about.\nBut, who could have guessed that not only would it not disappear, but the final momentum of its dying embers of life were enough to threaten him to this extent?\nEven though the tentacles had lost the power backing them, thus making them far weaker than when the creature was alive, they were still falling toward Leonel and Aina. Considering the size of the octopus, Leonel didn't even want to calculate the weight each of those tentacles carried, or else he might pass out in shock before he even had a chance to resist.\nSuddenly, Aina's voice called out.\n\"Catch the ax!\"\nHer voice snapped him out of his thoughts. He turned quickly to find that the ax he had left embedded within the octopus's limb had pulled itself free and was now flying toward them.\nLeonel understood Aina's intention immediately. If an ax that heavy soared toward them fast enough, it would be able to knock them off the path of trajectory the tentacles were aimed toward!\nLeonel twisted his body in the air, catching the flying ax with both hands.\n\"Oof…\"\nThough Leonel felt his arms go numb as a strong force rammed into him, he couldn't have been more happy. This was enough!\nTheir direction was forcefully altered, sending them flying through a gap in the octopus's limbs and crashing toward the remains of a collapsed building.\nLeonel braced himself, circulating the last dregs of his Force into his legs and landing heavily.\nThunderous booms sounded as the octopus finally collapsed. That battle hadn't lasted for even a minute, but Leonel felt completely spent.\n'Weird…' Leonel frowned. '… Why aren't there any Invalids here yet?'\nBefore Leonel could ask his father's dictionary to see if it had an answer, he suddenly felt his spatial bracelet activate on its own.\nThe Segmented Cube flew out, its numerous pieces breaking apart and enveloping the octopus's corpse before forming back into the size of Leonel's palm once again.\nLeonel blinked in astonishment. 'This thing seems to have intelligence of its own? How else do you explain this?'\nThough Leonel wanted to scrutinize the cube more, he didn't have the luxury. After putting it away, he broke out into another sprint.\nWithout a spear, it would be difficult for him to use [Call of the Wind] again. Force techniques were too dangerous so he had learned to not modify them on a whim. It was impossible for him to change it into a technique suitable for axes.\nPlus, even if he could… What Force would he do it with?\n\"Why are there no Invalids here?\" Leonel asked the dictionary which now lay in his palm.\n[ *Ping* Calculating… The most likely cause is related to the nature of Invalids. Invalids are creatures of instinct whose sole aim is to devour and evolve. However, they can only devour creatures of their species. Powerful creatures of a differing species are great deterrences to them as they are sources of danger without profit. ]\nHearing this, Leonel skidded to a stop. That A-grade Invalid only appeared after he was a distance away from the octopus now that he thought about it. It was just that the octopus could cover obscene distances with that leaping ability of its.\nBut, if there was a species limitation, then why would this octopus come after him so fervently?\n'Wait… This octopus didn't disappear, so it's unlikely to be an Invalid. There must be another reason it saw me as a potential meal, and that reason may very well be related to why the Segmented Cube acted on its own… Forget it, now isn't the time to think about this. I need to focus on getting back to the Fort.'\n\"Quickly, how do Invalids differentiate between members of their species and those that are not?\"\nLeonel realized that this likely meant that not all Invalids were humans, but he didn't have time to ponder on this.\n[ *Ping* Responding to Seed, it depends. Low level Invalids mostly rely on olfactory senses. High level Invalids have many more options, too variable to list. ]\nLeonel's gaze shone. The place he had skidded to a stop by was exactly the place he had sliced into the octopus's tentacle. There just so happened to be ghastly blue blood here.\nGritting his teeth, he made a decision.\n\"Sorry about this, Aina.\"\n**\nA day and a half later, in the depths of the night, the patrol unit of Royal Blue Fort felt as though they were walking on eggshells.\nIn recent days, the number of Invalids had taken a sharp tick upward. According to the superiors, something big had happened in Perimeter 7, causing the first instances of Invalid Tides to form.\nThe good news was that their target wasn't the Fort, but the residual effects had made what once was a fairly easy job to gain Ascension Points to become a life and death struggle.\nThe Head Patrol Guard during this round was a certain Tier 2 Officer Doran. He could only curse his bad luck. Had this happened just a day later, he would have been able to apply to enter an F-grade Zone and dodge all of this nonsense.\nBut now, the superiors didn't want to risk having to train inexperienced patrol units at such a dangerous time, so he could only swallow his grievances and continue on with his patrol job. At least he had gotten off better than those Tier 3 Officers who had Perimeters to patrol.\n'Hmph… That's what you all get for looking down on me…'\nRealizing that others had it worse than him seemed to make Doran feel much better.\nHe swept a gaze from the top of the Fort walls. He had completed this action so many times already that he had lost count. He had expected this time to be no different from the others, but he suddenly froze this time around.\nWithout hesitation, he pulled out a telescope, extending it and looking through. With the restrictions on technology, he could only use such a primitive tool. But, that didn't change its effectiveness.\nDoran blinked. What he saw shocked him.\nThere were two humans, but covered in some weird, cracking dark blue substance. One of them seemed to be carrying the other, but their states could only be described as sorry.\nThe young man carrying the young woman dragged a massive ax along the ground. He probably knew that such an action would slow his steps, but his arms didn't have the strength to lift that large weapon up anymore.\nWho else could these two be if not Leonel and Aina?\nThough the octopus blood had worked to a certain extent… it was just a certain extent.\nIt had 100% effectiveness on Invalids below the B-grade, but at the B-grade, it was barely 50% effective. For A-grade Invalids, it was not even 20% effective.\nIn the end, it had taken them over a day to cross just 50 kilometers because the initial commotion Leonel raised had caused an Invalid Tide. He felt spent to the point that his legs didn't even feel like his own anymore.\nHowever, despite seeing the looming Fort walls, the unease in Leonel's heart didn't settle down. Instead, it grew… because the danger he had been waiting for hadn't appeared yet.\nDoran's pupils constricted.\n'It's them. I need to inform the Junior Governor Duke.'",

      "content": "Leonel weakly dragged his body into the gates of the Fort. His eyes were half closed and his steps were so small it hardly looked like he was taking them at all, but he eventually made it.\nEvery part of his body felt as though it was on his last legs. Even he was quite surprised that he was still alive. It could only be said that the human capacity for survival was very large.\n\"… Hello? Hello!\"\nLeonel's head shook as he suddenly felt someone was calling out to him. He looked up to find the very same Tier 2 Officer Doran standing across from him, a blinding flashlight waving in his hand.\nLeonel squinted, finding it difficult to look at the light.\n'Why the hell is this guy waving something like this in my face?'\nIt was safe to say that Leonel was at the end of his rope. He was lacking in both sleep and strength, so even if he was a saint, his fuse would be much shorter. In that moment, he even had the faint will to gather this massive ax he was dragging one more time and cleave this bastard in two.\nIn the end, he managed to restrain himself.\n\"… Do you think you can just ignore me? You might be some big shot, but there are still protocols to be followed —\"\nSpittle flew from Doran's lips, some of which even attached itself to his bushy mustache as he tried to interrogate Leonel.\nHe wasn't exactly wrong. Leonel and Aina had left their Perimeter before their post could be taken over, this was already an offense. On top of this, they failed to return with the military jeep they were assigned — yet another offense. Now, Doran had already asked Leonel several questions, to which he got no answers. And, of course, this was another offense.\nRight now, they were still in a Code Red: Class 9 state. In such a state, crimes had punishments several times harsher than the norm. Even something as mundane and benign as shoplifting might get one 20 or more years in prison.\nWhen the offenses were related to military order, the punishments would be even harsher as military law tended to be.\nLeonel and Aina weren't official members of the military, which might still lighten their sentence. After all, the Fort was strapped for helping hands and every powerful individual was worth a lot. Doran obviously knew this, but he felt dissatisfied because he thought Leonel was ignoring him.\nClearly, Doran didn't realize that the reason he was still a TIer 2 Officer was because of his own stupidity. Considering the state of Leonel, who would assume that he was ignoring a person instead of realizing he was an arrow at the end of his flight?\nLeonel's barely opened eyes slowly opened wider. The action seemed to take all of his strength, but what Doran saw made him stumble backward uncontrollably, finally allowing the blinding light to move from Leonel.\nA beast. A wild beast that might lash out at any moment. That was what he saw.\nA roar assaulted his mind as he fell to the ground.\nCold shivers and sweats traveled through his back as he stared up at Leonel, eyes filled with fear.\nThe other Officers looked toward Doran with weird expressions. Leonel hadn't done anything but look at him. Was there a need to react like this?\nLeonel slowly walked by the fallen Tier 2 Officer. He only had thoughts of finally resting. He just had to make it back to his bed. No.. Any bed would do, he wasn't picky.\nThen, he could sleep for a whole week and forget about all of this.\nAt that moment, more bright lights blocked Leonel's path. But, this time, they didn't come from a flashlight, but rather a few vehicles. Beneath the night sky, their high-lights made Leonel's eyes burn.\nThe frustration in Leonel's heart grew deeper. He just wanted to sleep. Why were all of these people continually blocking his way?\nHe was already so close to home. He had walked through the outer city, through the illusion mist, and into the inner city. He had been moments away from his bed when he suddenly found the mansion he had been given was surrounded by a few shuttles.\n\"Leonel Morales, the Junior Governor Duke would like to have a few words with you.\"\nAt this point, Leonel felt a boiling anger in his chest.\nA word with him? Right now? They didn't send medical personnel or even ask if he was alright, but instead asked him to drag his body to see some Governor Duke's son who couldn't even bother to appear himself?\nLeonel didn't even care about the fact that the Junior Governor Duke's appearance here meant that he had cleared an A-grade Zone. Compared to what he had just been through, could an A-grade Zone even be comparable?\nHowever, with so many shuttles around him, maybe even equipped with weapon technology Leonel couldn't imagine, what could he even do? He found himself too tired even to express his rage.\nOthers believed that Leonel was very mild tempered, and that he was. But there was something about himself that James had pointed out on the day of the National Championship.\nLeonel knew that James was trying to throw the game. He also knew that his friend must have had his reasons. However, he couldn't decide between his best friend and a game he had already won three times before.\nJames was like a brother to him. They had stayed side by side for four years. Anyone else, for the sake of such a friendship, might have acquiesced that one time and lost the game on purpose.\nYet, instead of doing so, Leonel found a method to both not hurt his friend while also winning the game in the end.\nOf course, having known Leonel for so long, James saw through his friend with ease. Others may have thought that Leonel was simply unaware, but James knew that while Leonel was soft hearted, what he hated the most was losing.\nLeonel's insistence on his father's mantra of Persistence and Respect might sound like a kid just idolizing his father, however, it was deeper than that. It was so deep that Leonel himself didn't recognize it, only those who were the closest to him did… Just like James.\nSo, when Leonel was making his way to the Junior Governor Duke's residence with a bubbling rage in his chest he could do nothing about, that hidden beast kept lashing out.\nThe aura around him became insufferable. Even the veteran soldiers around him felt like it was difficult to breathe. Only those Tier 5 veterans like Admiral Millan just barely managed to keep their knees from knocking together.\nSoon, weak body and all, Leonel found himself in the living room of a mansion far more luxurious than his own. Everything seemed flooded with gold and white as though the Sun God Apollo was the owner of the residence.\nStill, there was no sign of the Junior Governor Duke. It wasn't until Leonel heard a pair of voices that he realized there was a ledge above the living room that was being fed into by a pair of curved stairs.\nUnfortunately, he felt too weak to raise his head, he could only barely see the shoes of the two above him and make out that they were two men.\n\"Miles, I really have to thank you this time. Without your help, I don't think I could ever get revenge for my fallen comrades.\"\n\"Is there even a need for such words between us, Simeon? Plus, my Governor Duke Family has an obligation to keep law and order. Whether you came forward or not, there would be appropriate punishments.\"\n\"It seems I've worried too much, then. The Leum Family is indeed trustworthy.\"\nThe words of the two young men stopped. Leonel could faintly guess that they were looking down the ledge and toward him.\n\"Leonel Morales. Aina Brazinger.\" The voice of the man called Miles filled Leonel's ears. From their conversation, Leonel could understand that he must be the Junior Governor Duke.\n\"We have evidence that you've cooperated to slay six citizens of our Ascension Empire. Even without Martial Law, the penalty would be death. As citizens of the Empire, you have the right to know what you are being imprisoned for, so I have told you. Escort them to the basement. They will remain there until the trial.\"\nThe young man spoke with indifference. To him, the trial was just a facade. The two of them were as good as dead.\nWell… Leonel would die. As for the girl on his back, she would be sent off in chains to the Brazinger Family.\nLeonel came to understand something. He had been a bit naive. He hadn't thought much about what would happen here since they were entering a mansion. If they were in trouble, shouldn't they have been directly sent to the jails?\nBut it was then he understood. For two Variants like them… Miles' illusion ability was the best kind of trap.\nLeonel barely struggled to raise his head and only then did he see the faces of the two young men.\nOne of them had a bright head of white-gold hair that almost looked like the mane of a lion. As for the other, Leonel's vision was too blurred to see most of his features, but what he did see was the monocle over his left eye. No… one would be hard pressed to call it a monocle at all. It had eight lenses that seemed to hover in space in a circular formation.",

Pray for my ligaments :'( ]\nLeonel didn't react much to Miles' words, something that was out of the expectations of the latter.\nThough he spoke those words with indifference, that didn't mean he expected indifference in return. In fact, he was very much expecting to hear several shouts and a torrent of cursing. It wasn't even out of his expectation that Leonel might try to run away and fight his way out.\nOf course, all of this would be futile. The range of this illusion world was almost like his own lucid dream. The downside of his ability was that it took a lot of time to set up a range so large, but the benefit was that once it had been, not only was the drain on his spirit minimized, but his power was several times greater as well.\nIn truth, Leonel was finished the moment he crossed into this city. Miles' confidence was obvious by the fact he hadn't even confiscated the ax in Leonel's hand.\nThe Officials who escorted Leonel here had long since surrounded him. Seeing that Leonel didn't react, they didn't relax as one would expect.\nBy now, Leonel's vision had cleared a bit more. He could see that the young man with a monocle over his left eye had blazing red hair and eyes just like the six weremen had. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, a light smile on his face. His impeccably clean and crisp clothing made his meticulousness evident.\nLeonel slowly raised the ax in his hand, causing the officers to tense. But, Miles and Simeon continued to look down with indifference on their faces. Even if Leonel was in peak condition, they wouldn't have to fear him in this place, let alone now in his current state.\nHowever, they could have never expected that instead of attacking, Leonel would be using the last of his strength to slip the ax back into the holster on Aina's back.\nTo those watching him, his actions didn't make much sense at all.\n\"… So you want to deal with me, is that right?\"\nLeonel's voice sounded quite hoarse. It could be imagined that he hadn't had a drop of water in a day and a half now. With how hard he had been pushing his body, it was a wonder that he was even standing.\nMiles' brows knit slightly. His first instinct was to not respond. He simply disdained to. However, he found himself opening his mouth to do exactly that before he knew what was happening. It was as though he had been compelled to.\nThis level of charisma… It was hard to imagine it was a boy before him and not a Tier 7 or higher General.\nThough he managed to stop himself right before the words came from his mouth, he was left in an awkward position. Everyone could tell that he had been about to speak and could only look at him in confusion when his mouth hung open without a word.\nHowever, in the end, though he spoke, it wasn't to Leonel.\n\"Take him away.\"\nLeonel moved again and Miles' frown deepened as he watched the Officers continue to hesitate. They watched as he took out three silver rods and twisted them together into a long pole, one after another.\n\"What methods do I have to protect myself from illusions?\"\nLeonel seemed to be speaking to himself. Every action he took was like a madman that couldn't be seen through. It felt like he just might lash out at them at any time. But then, unexpectedly, something responded.\n[ *Ping* Seed's Soul Force is too high to be influenced by illusions beneath the Bronze grade, only Seed's eyes can be fooled. It is suggested that Seed close his eyes and make use of Internal Sight to battle. ]\n[ *Information Omitted* ]\nThe words of the dictionary made Miles' pupils constrict.\n\"Stop him —!\"\nThe words had hardly left his lips with the blunt tip of Leonel's rod had appeared before Admiral Millan.\nLeonel had already guessed that this TIer 5 Admiral had an ability that utilized his voice. If not for this, an Admiral with no personal combat ability like him wouldn't be sent here to escort Leonel.\nWhat Leonel could afford the least right now to lose his hearing or have his inner ear be affected.\nThe truth was that Leonel's Internal Sight was far sharper, more detailed, and more useful than his eyesight. It was just that Leonel had grown up all his life using his eyes to see and interact with the world. Suddenly having Internal Sight now made him feel as though he suddenly had another pair of arms he wasn't used to using yet.\nHowever, now, he had no choice but to rely on it. What he couldn't have imagined was that the moment he closed his eyes and leaned on his Internal Sight completely that a rush of comfort would overwhelm his body.\nIt was as though a drying river had suddenly been fed by a crystal clear lake. What was a shame was that the dam originally blocking the lake from the river was actually Leonel himself!\nEverything felt sharper and more controlled. The finest details of everything from his own body to his surroundings were projected into his mind without delay.\nLeonel wasn't a fool. He knew that the lingering danger had yet to be resolved, so how could he come back here without any preparations at all? Though his body was in such a state, his Force and spirit weren't running completely on empty.\nAdmiral Millan's eyes widened. He had just been opening his mouth to send a concentrated blast toward Leonel when the rod appeared before him.\nHe sighed a breath of relief when he realized it had no blade. However, it was simply too fast for him to dodge. He could only brace himself for impact.\nBut… he could have never imagined that the blunt tip would carry so much force behind it.\nThe first thing he felt was the wall that hit his back. No… It should be that his back hit the wall.\nThen, he registered that all of his ribs had been broken. He couldn't even scream without the searing pain of his lungs being minced by his own bones making his eyes roll back into their sockets.\nHe shook as he slid to the ground as though he was going into epileptic shock. This was maybe the only sign that his life was holding on by a small thread.\n\"The Empire has been pissing me off for a long time already.\" Leonel said slowly, his eyes firmly clamped shut. \"Since you want me, come and get me.\"",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 300 powerstones, next at 600 :) ]\nIt could only be said that they were caught completely unprepared. Just like Leonel had guessed, the surveillance on him wasn't as air tight as he believed.\nAfter the Metamorphosis, technology of their world almost ceased to function entirely. Technology, even in this futuristic era, still fundamentally relied on electricity which was ultimately the movement of electrons from one point to another. However, Force was constructed of the quantum particles that governed the laws electrons used.\nWith the benign Third Dimensional Force evolving into the Fourth Dimensional Force of a Fourth Dimensional World, those fundamental laws that governed everything were changing. As such, how could technology continue to function?\nThe Ascension Empire had put a lot of effort and research into building technology that could function in the Fourth Dimension, but Earth was ultimately still in its infantile stages.\nThe only reason some technology continued to work now was because Earth was still only a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional World. The Metamorphosis hadn't been completed in its entirety just yet. But, it was safe to say that Earth had lost more than 90% of its original capabilities. And now, only more primitive technologies like the military jeep worked in the outside world.\nAs for the shuttle of the weremen, Leonel was simply unaware that the model of the shuttle had been modified and downgraded. If not for this, let alone 300 kilometers an hour, a true shuttle could break the sound barrier without issue.\nThis was all to say that let alone having his personal satellite like Leonel imagined in his worst case scenario, Earth didn't even have a single satellite remaining. In addition, the highest class of tech could only be used in specific places where towers designed to disrupt Force operated.\nThe good news, then, was that Leonel wasn't as hopeless as he thought. The weremen likely only found them making use of a gps hidden within the military jeep.\nThe bad news, however, as Leonel was finding out now… Was that he was completely unable to use Force within the inner city where technology flourished.\nThis was a major miscalculation on Leonel's part. In his defense, he hadn't spent long enough in the Fort to notice such a thing. He was too inexperienced and only slept a single night here. But, at this point, he didn't have the mind to care.\nHe was pissed.\nThere wasn't a single drop of emotion on his face, but to those facing him, it felt like he was three times their size.\nAt this point, fear had gripped their hearts. Leonel hadn't made another move after incapacitating Admiral Millan. It was as though he was waiting for something.\n\"He is resisting an arrest issued by a Governor Duke Seal. Kill him.\"\nMiles' cold voice was like the gun of a drag race. Those who had been hesitating and even somewhat fearful, still pulled on the holsters attached to their hips without hesitation, pointing their guns at Leonel.\nGuns weren't much different from the past. They didn't shoot laser beams, but rather still functioned on bullets. However, in this era, even a handgun had no less strength than a sniper rifle.\nTechnology, instead of evolving toward higher grade ammo, put the most effort into increasing the strength of alloys, compressing force, and mitigating recoil.\nIn this era, every gun was outfitted with a complex gyroscope capable of measuring force and a haptic feedback system that used the data provided by the gyroscope to nullify this force. As a result, even the most powerful pistols not only had amazing armor piercing capability, they were also as steady as airsoft guns kids used to play.\nHowever, to Leonel, this wasn't an entirely bad thing… The steadier the hand, the easier it was to predict.\nLeonel had always been worried about guns. Even the most primitive guns of the medieval ages made him nervous. However, after he stopped using his eyes, he suddenly realized something.\nSubconsciously, he could draw a line from the muzzle of the gun to where it would end up. It was almost like he was projecting his Dream World into the real world, as though he could simulate everything that would happen.\nIt was only a vague feeling, and Leonel could even feel that this was a still unawakened ability of his, but it was there nonetheless.\nNo one could have imagined that just when half a dozen guns had turned toward Leonel, he would take a step forward the instant their fingers pulled the trigger.\nIn the beginning, they thought that he was only fearless because he hadn't seen the guns. After all, his eyes were closed and these officials had never heard of this 'Internal Sight'. But, the scene that played out was completely out of their expectations.\nIt almost seemed like the bullets had flown through Leonel without obstruction, as though he had become transparent and blurry just for a moment.\nHowever, Leonel knew the truth. One flew beneath his arm, two between his legs, one narrowly missing his neck, and the final two by his head.\nHe wasn't fast enough to dodge bullets. But, he was fast enough to dodge their trajectory.\nWith another two pierces of his rod, another two officers went down.\n\"What's his ability and what does it do?\"\nLeonel walked through a rain of bullets, taking down the final four officers. His attention was toward the young man with a monocle, who even now, couldn't have expected such a result.\nLeonel was simply too calm. It really did feel as though they had woken a slumbering beast. Simeon and Miles watched from the ledge as Leonel, without an ounce of hurry, took six guns and twelve reload clips to himself.\n[ *Ping* Generating nomenclature… ]\n[ Evolution Stage: Tier 8 Black ]\n[ Evolution Type: Auxiliary ]\n[ Evolution: Reinforced Mind, Genetic Manipulation ]\n[ Reinforced Mind: Mental capacity several times that of normal a individual. Special emphasis on eyesight. ]\n[ Genetic Manipulation: Can sense the evolution path of those below the Tier 7 Black grade and Diverge or Converge it. ]\n\"I see…\"\nLeonel took a gun and aimed it toward Miles and Simeon with his left hand and shot twice in quick succession.\nThe power, the recoil, the speed… He had already seen through it all.\n\"… Unfortunate.\"\nHowever, Leonel already mumbled this word before the bullets even landed.\nBANG! BANG!\nA thin energy shield blocked the bullets. The two young men, with cold sweat matted down their backs, watched on as the two bullets slowly fell before their eyes. Had it not been for the security system of Miles' home… they would be dead.\nThe most shocking part was that Leonel hadn't shot toward the illusion Miles had set up… but rather toward his real body.\nHis expression turned solemn. 'Even if you're ten times stronger, you won't leave the city alive.'\nIn order to maintain the peace, there were exceptionally few who knew of this operation. This was part of the reason they allowed Leonel to go so far as to walk back to his own home.\nHowever, if the secret couldn't be kept, that was fine as well. Now that Leonel had attacked so many officials, and even a Tier 5 one at that, it would be even easier. With such evidence, it was impossible for the Right to Autonomy Amendment to work in his defense.\nLeonel turned his back to the two men. One of them had an illusion ability that was useless against him and the other had a mental ability. They were not his opponents. His true enemy was waiting outside.\nAs expected, Leonel had hardly taken a step outside when the sound of horns shook the dark night sky. Several spotlights converged from all directions, alerting everyone to the state of emergency.\nThousands were mobilized in a few breaths. And, it seemed that Miles was more cautious than he seemed on the surface because even the usually unguarded inner city doors were blocked.\nHowever, this was a problem Leonel would love to be facing. Because, as it stood now, he was still a few kilometers from those very doors.\nHe felt that something was disrupting his use of Force. As long as he could make it out of the range of that something, he could threaten the city by causing another Invalid Tide. Though he didn't want to put people in danger, this would be his very last resort.\nLeonel stepped out of the mansion on shaky legs, looking up at the dark sky, the twinkling stars, the silver moon…\nHis breathing was ragged. Just a few moves and he already felt that he had hit another wall.\n\"… Do you have anything that can hold my body together a bit longer?\" Leonel asked, a bit desperate feeling so many converge onto him through his Internal Sight.\nThis time… these weren't just normal, unevolved humans. They all had abilities… And their technology was levels beyond.\n[ *Ping* Replying to Seed, the meat of evolved creatures is the best nourishment for Evolvers. ]\nAs though having heard the question, the Segmented Cube popped out once more before vanishing. All that was left was a head-size cube of rich, pinkish violet meat.\n'… Raw octopus, huh…? I hear it's a delicacy…'",

      "content": "Leonel took a step forward, taking a large bite out of the hunk of meat at the same time.\n'In a city like this, they're unlikely to use explosives. The greatest danger to my safety are snipers. The range of my Internal Sight can't possibly be wide enough to take them into account. I also can't guarantee there isn't anyone with an ability that makes them confident in sniping even if I'm in the midst of a crowd. —'\nLeonel's thoughts suddenly froze.\nHe felt as though a flame had suddenly dropped into his stomach and he felt incredibly heavy. The bloating in his stomach slowed his steps, making him uncomfortable.\nLeonel was never one to eat much. In fact, he had had a poor appetite for as long as he could remember. Due to this disposition of his, it was a wonder that he wasn't a skeleton. This aside, it was safe to say that he hadn't experienced this feeling before.\n'… No, that's not true. I have… The first time dad gave me that vomit brew…'\nLeonel's burrow furrowed. The discomfort wasn't enough to slow him down severely, but it made him feel a bit sick. He was already not in an optimal state. He couldn't afford even the slightest tick down in his stats.\n'What the hell…' Leonel felt like cursing this damn dictionary and his dad for creating a faulty product.\nLeonel's frown deepened, but he couldn't continue remaining here. He had to make it to the doors out of the city as quickly as possible.\nThe moment Leonel broke out into a run, he felt his blood begin to boil. Before Leonel could even pause to figure out what was wrong with him, he found that his stomach was already rumbling.\nThe hunger was severe to the point Leonel almost fell over. The rolling and contracting muscles of his stomach felt like they might tear his body apart any moment.\nFeeling a bit fearful and shocked, Leonel quickly took another bite. By the end of it, he bit into his palm, not realizing the meat was already consumed.\n\"What the hell is wrong with me?\"\n[ *Ping* Information Omitted ]\nLeonel almost began cursing again, but his expression changed when he saw a troop of soldiers marching through the streets and toward him.\nThe sight of black clothes military men stomping in unison through a residential area was particularly dystopian. However, Leonel didn't have the time to take in the sight. He could only dive through the side gates of a nearby mansion.\nHe might be able to dodge the trajectory of bullets, but he wasn't insane. There were at least three dozen tactical rifles between them. Compared to the pistols in Leonel's possession which could already be considered as powerful as sniper rifles of the past, their power could be imagined.\nLeonel leapt up with all his power, grabbing the edge of a house's roof and pulling himself up.\n\"Get down! Stop resisting!\"\nThe roar of a man used to command entered Leonel's ears. But, he couldn't have imagined that Leonel would have already appeared on the roof when they were still seeking to cut him off from the side and back of the house.\n'These men are clearly highly trained, but this is also their downfall. They don't dare to step out of line, which means they're restricting themselves from using their abilities. This is to my advantage…'\nLeonel's gaze flashed. He put his rod away and two guns appeared in his hands.\nHe kept his head low as the tactical unit surrounded the house from all sides. The instant before they realized Leonel wasn't still on the ground, he had already jumped.\nLeonel's body flew horizontally in the air, his arms pointed downward and his eyes blazing with fighting intent.\nThe sounds of gunshots rang beneath the night sky, followed by pained grunts and dull thuds.\nWith a flip, Leonel landed on the roof of an opposing house and broke out into another sprint.\n\"Give me another piece, I'm starving.\" Leonel said, hoping his words would be effective.\nThankfully, the Segmented Cube didn't let him down. Another head-sized cube of octopus meat appeared in his hand and disappeared into his stomach just as fast.\nThe burning in Leonel's blood grew. It was so comfortable that he almost forgot the aching of his muscles. It was a similar feeling to someone working out with sore muscles. After a while, the heat would make one forget the pain. However, if one stopped, the aching might return with several folds more potency.\nLeonel knew he couldn't afford this, so he continued to push his body, hoping this heat would continue.\n\"Halt!\"\nAnother roar entered Leonel's ears. It seemed that the captain from before had found his dead squad members. With a single leap, Leonel had shot six bullets and taken out six of them.\nHe didn't want to kill, but going down here meant that his life was basically over. The way Miles was trying to toy with his future left him sick to his stomach. However, what disgusted him the most was that if he were caught, Aina would definitely be sent to the Brazinger Clan. He refused to let this happen.\nIn that case, his conscience was clear. He could have easily killed them all, but he only killed enough to leave unscathed. He had already been merciful enough.\nAina watched silently as all of this happened, shaking her head. In truth, Leonel somehow thought she was still sleeping. But, how could she be sleeping in a situation like this?\n'… He needs to learn that being kind to your enemies is only harming yourself…'\nA cold light flickered in Aina's eyes, but she remained silent. Pretending as though she was still 'asleep'.\nLeonel was absolutely unstoppable. The small tactical units sent after him one after another didn't even pose any challenge. The terrain was too disadvantageous to them.\nThey didn't dare to shoot toward Leonel carelessly. Who in this city wasn't a big shot? Did they even have the ability to take responsibility if one of these figures died in their homes because they were shooting at Leonel?\nTo make matters worse, Leonel having guns was like giving wings to a tiger. His senses were too sharp, his coordination too elite.\nEvery time he shot, a bullet would perfectly land in the gap of their armor, ending their lives swiftly. They almost couldn't believe that Leonel was only using handguns. Even if they were as powerful as sniper rifles of the past, the armors the tactical units wore in this age had advanced just as much.\nHowever, it didn't seem to matter.\nOver an hour later, Leonel sat behind the side gates of yet another home, his breathing ragged.\nHe had already swapped into the tactical gear of a soldier. The only thing he didn't change were his treasure shoes. Even if he couldn't use them in range of whatever was disrupting Force, they would still be useful to him in the future.\nLeonel tied Aina to his back once more, gritting his teeth as he stepped forward.\nFrom here until the doors, there were no longer homes to constantly hide behind. It was practically a flat plain.\nBetween Leonel's location and the doors out of the city, there was a city square and park. The space was as open as Royal Blue Academy's campus and the city square had no cover aside from a large fountain that sputtered water from the mouth of a mermaid and whale.\nNot only were there units all throughout the park, but there was a small troop of at least 200 standing at attention right before the doors.\nOn a tower far away from the danger, Miles and Simeon watched on coldly. They hadn't managed to get eyes on Leonel just yet. They had a feeling that something with strong Force was protecting his body under these conditions, or else it was impossible that their surveillance systems couldn't lock onto him.\nBut that didn't matter. There was only one way into and out of the city. It had been specifically designed like this to stop rogues like Leonel.\nLeonel practically inhaled another head-sized piece of octopus meat before slamming down the black head gear of the tactical unit.\nIn order to get this, he had actually doubled back toward the units he had already killed. This was part of the reason his location still hadn't been locked down and why he now had two tactical rifles in his possession.\nUnlike the handguns, these rifles had 50 bullets per clip and were several times more powerful. With this kind of fire power, he still had a chance.\nUnfortunately, things wouldn't be so simple. To now, the tactical units hadn't used their abilities. But, this didn't mean there weren't specially trained units. After all… Miles couldn't clear an A-grade Zone alone.\nSince the beginning of the Metamorphosis, Royal Blue Province had experienced the appearance of four A-grade Sub-Dimensional Zones. One wiped out a special unit completely but three units survived, one of which, led by Miles, managed to clear the fourth just recently.\nLeonel took a deep breath, his eyes gaining a deep calm as he stood out from the final home and entered the park with confident steps.\nBANG!\nLeonel's pupils constricted as he quickly fell to one side, but it was already too late.\nA searing pain appeared in his left shoulder, precisely tearing through the smallest gap in the joint of his armor.\nBANG!\nAnother shot rang out.",

I'm not mentioning this for any particular reason, just an interesting tidbit about my life. :) ]\nXinghai had always been a proud man.\nWhen he was three years old, he was designated as a Five Star Arms Professional. In the history of the Ascension Empire, barely a thousand people had ever earned such an evaluation.\nFrom that day onward, he was placed under the intensive care of the government with the consent of his parents. He began playing with swiss army knives before his fourth birthday and was already handling guns by the time he was seven.\nWhen he began school, he entered the Royal Blue Education program, starting from Royal Blue Elementary School, entering Royal Blue Middle School, and eventually venturing to Royal Blue Academy.\nHe received the best education, the best nutrition plans, and the best care and attention one could ask for. He boasted a position in the top 1000 of the Most Eligible Minors list before his 18th birthday, and even after he became 18, he was within the top 10 000 Eligible Bachelors list.\nHowever, after graduating from Royal Blue Academy five years ago, life became boring to him.\nHis family background wasn't as great as his peers, so he found moving up ranks in the army difficult. The rebels who spent their time trying to take down the Ascension Empire were nothing more than a clown show who could only cause skirmishes once in a while. And, without a high enough rank, he wouldn't be trusted enough to become a part of missions to quell rebellions on the Moon and Mars.\nHis life stagnated.\nSure, with his potential, all he had to do was wait a few decades for those old fogies to die and he would eventually get his shot. But… he didn't have such patience.\nBefore the Metamorphosis began, he had actually been approached by a member of the rebel army. Instead of reporting the incident like he should have, he actually kept it to himself.\nWhat he wanted the most was the thrill. He loved battle and those damned virtual reality pods weren't worth shit to him. How was it the same if his life wasn't on the line? If he couldn't feel his blood boil? If he couldn't feel his opponent's life slipping between his fingers?\nHe needed more.\nIf it wasn't for the Descent of the Metamorphosis, he really would have joined the rebel army and stuck it to those bastards who tried to bury his talent like that.\nBut, it seemed there was a God smiling down at him. Just when he was about to, his ability awakened, then Invalids appeared, and then Zones began to open one after another.\nJust like that, his boring life revved back up. He suddenly felt thrill again.\nThe longer he spent in a world like this, the more he felt that this was the way it should be. When things were too peaceful, things would be too boring. He wasn't one of those hypocrites who thought one needed to struggle to evolve. No…\nHe just wanted to kill.\nJust a bit over an hour ago, Xinghai learned of what was going on here. After he was told that Leonel was all alone and was actually carrying a girl on his back, he disdained to participate. This kind of boring hunt, what the hell did it have to do with him?\nHe could have never imagined that this prey would be so interesting. It made him a bit curious, almost like a cat who found an adorable mouse.\nAfter finding himself a nice tall tower, he picked out his favorite sniper rifle and settled in.\nIf one knew his personality and saw him now, they would find the scene to be completely out of their expectations. How a man who lived for battle and blood could remain motionless for so long, to the point of not even seeming to breathe, no one would be able to tell.\nYet, this was exactly what Xinghai had done. His right eye remained trained on his scope, the barrel of his rifle as steady as the surface of a calm lake. Even after he saw his prey, his heart beat remained smooth and unhurried. One would never guess that this was a man he had waited over an hour for.\nAs though his sniper rifle was a part of his body, he pulled the trigger in unison with a deep breath. As he exhaled, the bullet exited the barrel as though on a line and pierced the shoulder of his prey.\nBANG!\nThat was when something completely out of Xinghai's expectations happened. The sound of the second bullet didn't come from his gun… but his prey's!\nIt was impossible. Sniper rifles of the 21st century had a range of about a kilometer at best. However, those of the 25th could shoot from ten kilometers away. Not only were they equipped with far stronger bullets, but they also came with an on board AI capable of executing the calculations a sniper needed with much more ease than a human.\nDue to the size of the inner city and the situation, Xinghai hadn't found it necessary to be so far away. So, he picked a tower just a kilometer and a half away from where he guessed Leonel would appear.\nWith the power of his sniper rifle and at such a short distance, Leonel could have died on his first shot. But, wanting to play around a bit, Xinghai aimed for Leonel's shoulder first. He wanted to see his prey squirm and struggle for life, maybe even beg for mercy.\nBut, who knew that his prey would actually be able to react to a small extent. Like that, the bullet that should have been powerful enough to blow his arm off was actually obstructed by the tactical armor, causing it to lose some momentum and only pierce into his arm instead.\nAnd, as if that wasn't shocking enough, without the slightest hesitation, his prey turned toward his direction as though their gazes could meet across the impossibly long distance and fired a single bullet.\nXinghai could feel it. That bullet radiated and dripped with confidence. He didn't fire a second and didn't even wait for it to land. His prey turned and sprinted into the park, disappearing into the depths of the small forest.\nDanger overwhelmed Xinghai's senses. It was impossible, but he knew what would happen. This bullet would hit him. He was as good as dead.\nWhat a funny joke this was. If someone told him that someone could aim an ordinary rifle with a single arm and accurately shoot down a target over a kilometer away, with how sadistic Xinghai was, he might just cut the person to pieces with his favorite swiss army knife.\nBut here it was, happening before him now.\nThe bullet tore through the air, invisible in the night sky. Sometimes, it would catch the moonlight's rays and glisten a beautiful silver before disappearing once more as though entering the void.\nSSSHHHUUUUUU\nThe bullet tore into the tower.\nIn the last moment, Xinghai blinked away, disappearing and appearing one meter to his left.\nBANG!\nSilence fell. The only thing that could be heard in the high tower now were Xinghai's ragged breaths. He didn't even react when he felt violent bits of shrapnel, coming from his sniper rifle, assaulting him and tearing into his flesh.\nAfter a long while, Xinghai stood, completely naked. If others were here, they would see his military uniform and gear laid on the floor where he had been lying just a moment ago, burnt to a crisp. As for his sniper rifle… it was in pieces.\nSlowly, Xinghai made his way to the remains of the barrel. It had split apart as though an explosion had gone off inside of it.\nIt took a while, but Xinghai finally understood. The instant he shot his prey, he had given him everything he needed to know about his location. In the blink of an eye, his prey took that information and fired back. The shot was so precise that the bullet even entered the very nozzle the original bullet came from, almost taking Xinghai's life.\nAt this moment, Xinghai was in a sorry state. Bits of shrapnel had torn into the right side of his body. Luckily, he had timed his blink just right so that the brunt of the explosion passed him by. But, he was still a bit injured.\nXinghai grinned.\nThe sight of a man smiling with an entire side of his face dripping in blood was enough to send cold shivers down one's spine. But, it only became more obscene when Xinghai licked his lips like a rabid dog.\nThis prey. He wanted it.",

      "content": "From their own tower, Miles and Simeon watched this happen with flickering expressions.\nAt first, they thought that Leonel was just flailing about like a headless chicken. They fully expected that the sniper would fire a second time to end his life. But, the second shot they were expecting never came. The only explanation was that Leonel's singular shot was effective in disrupting the sniper or even… killed him.\nThe two looked at each other, the hint of coldness between them obvious.\nFor Miles, he wanted Leonel and Aina out of the picture so that he could better control the situation of Royal Blue Province. With his father gone to the capital, this was a time for him to establish his authority and gain some power for himself. The sudden appearance of two Variants would make those plans nearly impossible.\nUnfortunately, without proper cause, he didn't dare to lay a hand on one Variant, let alone two. But who knew that Leonel would do something as foolish as committing an act of murder? This was like a pie falling from the skies and into his lap.\nFor Simeon, his goal was even more obvious. The idea that a bastard child of the Brazinger family could now hold such power was impossible for them to accept. As things stood now, he was still the only one aware of Aina's Variant status as only he paid attention to the outside world. The other members of the family and families like them disdained to do such a thing.\nHowever, if the family found out about Aina's existence and realized he had acted but failed to bring her back, he would suffer some punishment without a doubt.\nUnfortunately, the hands of both of them were tied. One had an ability that was useless before Leonel, and the other was nothing without his genetically modified minions. They could only stand and watch as things unfolded…\n**\nThough Leonel had escaped into the small forest, he didn't expect it to provide him much cover. In fact, it was highly likely that there was another ambush waiting for him here.\nAt the end of the day, this wasn't a true forest. It was just a park. How could he expect to find thick vegetation and foliage to hide him in?\nInstead of giving this place his hope, Leonel stopped behind the first tree he could.\nWith Aina's ax being so large, he was confident in its ability to protect the back of their heads and backs. All he had to do was focus on his front. But he had to be quick, there was no telling if other squads could be converging from his back now that his location had been exposed.\nLeonel grit his teeth and pulled on the bullet in his shoulder. Due to his movement in the last second, it hadn't penetrated too deeply. He couldn't help but be impressed with the armor of the black tactical gear he was wearing.\nHe moved his left shoulder around a bit.\n'It's painful, but not to the point of being crippling. Let's go.'\nLeonel dashed forward a cold glint in his eyes.\nThose hiding in this small forest never thought that he would stop at the first line of trees, but it also seemed that they were unaware that their spots of ambush were all seen through by him during that moment of rest.\nLeonel slipped his rifle into his spatial bracelet and pulled out two handguns. They were all he needed.\nWithout slowing down even a beat, he raised his arms.\nLeonel's hands seemed to have a mind of their own. In one moment, they would be moving faster than a whip, in the next they would be as steady as a statue.\nIn those moments of steadiness, a single shot would ring through the forest, followed by a slight spark of light and the muffled groans and pained cries of men and women.\nThose faint sparks of light sometimes illuminated Leonel's face. Even hidden behind a helmet, one could see the smoothness of his brows and the unforced nature of his closed eyes. If it wasn't for the fact he was moving so quickly, one would think that he was asleep.\nLeonel bolted through the forest in a manner of minutes. In his wake, all that was left were corpses and a series of trees with a single bullet hole through their trunks.\nDeep breaths fogged the inside of Leonel's helmet as he sprinted across the edge of the park. He was almost there. The city square and the final line of defense would soon be before him.\n'How do I get past this…?'\nAs his mind was running wild, Leonel took out a second tactical helmet and slid it over Aina's head. That sniper from before scared him a bit. He thought that Aina would be safe on his back, but that bullet caught him completely off guard. There was no telling just how many snipers of that caliber there were, and he was about to enter an open field once again.\nHe caught a faint glimpse of Aina's sleeping face. Her cheek rested on his shoulder and her breathing was steady. She looked like a peaceful little fairy.\nLeonel couldn't help but smile. For a moment, the fatigue in his limbs completely vanished. He really was a lovestruck fool.\nAfter he secured the helmet on her head, his eyes became emotionless once more and then tipped over and became cold. It was fine if they all just got out of the way. If that was the case, he could let them be. But if they wanted to play a role in his Aina becoming a prisoner, they would have to pay the price.\nLeonel closed his eyes once more and reloaded the clip of two rifles. Then, he stood as though using the last of his strength to keep his back straight and began to fire like a madman.\nHe had done his best to gain an advantage. After stepping out from the last tree and onto expertly cobbled roads, the only thing between him and a lineup of 200 soldiers was a large water fountain with a mermaid sitting on a whale's back.",

      "content": "From the vantage point of the small troop, it was difficult to see Leonel from behind the water fountain. But, his bullets seemed to have eyes of their own.\nFlying through the mermaid's arms, beneath the whale's fins, through the jets of water, he rained hails of lethals shots toward them as though he could see through everything.\nSometimes, his bullets even hit the statue. But, despite the sturdy material it was made of, they pierced right through. Leonel seemed to always perfectly aim toward the weakest and thinnest parts of the statue, tearing through it like tofu.\n\"Fire!\"\nA commander roared, suddenly seeing his troop fall into turmoil. It had only been a few seconds, but over a dozen of his men had fallen, unable to rise again.\nBANG!\nAnother sniper rifle rang out as a hail of bullets came from the troop of 200. But, Leonel pretended as though he hadn't sensed anything, his steps only shifting slightly.\nThe loud clanging of metal resounded as the bullet rebounded off of Aina's ax. Despite the power, Leonel's stance was strong and steady. It was like he didn't know his neck had been moments away from being pierced through.\n\"Narrow the formation!\" The commander barked.\nLeonel's lips shrunk into a fine line.\n'I can't shoot anymore down from this angle. If I can take advantage of the fountain, so can they… In that case…'\nLeonel's fire suddenly concentrated on the water fountain.\nSeeing that no more men were falling, the commander felt that his previous command had been the perfect response. Leonel wasn't the only one who could take advantage of cover.\n\"Hold! HOLD! FORWARD!\"\nThe troop charged. There was barely a hundred meters between them and Leonel. As long as they closed in on him, they could fan out the formation and he would be surrounded.\nBut what happened next left them speechless.\nLeonel suddenly dashed forward and leapt into the air. With all his might, he kicked with both legs at the whale's head.\nThose who caught faint glimpses of this were left speechless. The action seemed ridiculous. However, those thoughts couldn't last long.\nWith a BANG, the water fountain collapsed and the remains of the mermaid and whale soared through the air for a moment before skidding violently along the ground.\nThe commander of the troop's eyes widened. He could have never guessed that Leonel's concentrated fire was aimed at the base of the statue's connection to the fountain. In that moment, he had weakened it just enough to kick it to the ground.\n\"Scatter! Scatter!\" He roared.\nUnfortunately for him, Leonel was riding atop the sliding whale, his hands pointed forward with two tactical rifles. Almost like a charging cavalry, he madly surged forward, bullets raining down with him as their point of origin.\nThe whale slid across the ground, smashing into the front line of the troop and squashing several of them before finally slowing down.\nLeonel didn't even bother with the rest of the scattering troop. This was the perfect opportunity.\nHe jumped down from the whale, dashing toward the inner city doors with all of his might.\nBullets rained down toward him, but they all clanged off of Aina's ax.\nHowever, in all his fervor, Leonel had forgotten one thing.\nThe moment he stepped out of the inner city and back into the outer, he felt that his Force was no longer restricted. This was good.\nWhat was bad was that he had forgotten that there was an outer city. And in the outer city, he saw a unit of eight waiting below the steps for him. These eight alone gave Leonel far more pressure than those 200 soldiers behind him had.\nLeonel gaze met theirs, his breathing ragged. It felt as though a hot coal was traveling through his lungs.\n'Dammit.'\nLeonel had already been pushing past his limits for too long already. He had been half a step into his grave before he even entered the Fort, let alone now after being madly chased for over an hour.\nJust now, he had been on the highest of highs, thinking that he had escaped, only to find that he hadn't at all. He came crashing down heavier than he went soaring up. The pain in his body seemed to want to tear him apart.\n\"Put down the weapons, boy. You've done enough harm.\"\nThe man who led the group seemed to be quite old, but his eyes and voice held a youthful vigor to them. There was something especially magical about his voice that made one want to bend over backwards to please him.\nSeeing that Leonel was a bit dazed, the special unit slowly mad their way forward, encircling Leonel.\nIt wasn't that Leonel couldn't tell what what was happening. In fact, from the very beginning, the pleasing voice hadn't influenced him at all. He just wanted a bit more time to rest, just a bit longer to catch his breath.\n'I'm so tired…' Leonel thought with haggard gasps.\nHowever, the special unit continued to approach and Leonel realized that the few seconds they would take to surround him wouldn't make much of a difference to the situation of his body at all.\nLeonel's grip of his rifles tightened. He willed them to flex as though pulling out the last of his strength. Once they were close enough he would move and leap over this hurdle too.\nWho would have known that at that exact moment, just when Leonel was going to hit another wall, he would suddenly feel that his back was exceptionally light all of a sudden?\nHis eyes blinked open, but he hardly reacted when a shadow appeared between the eight whose expressions were now changing drastically.\nA scythe of red-gold energy severed their necks at once, causing a rain of eight fountains of blood to shoot into the skies.\nBeneath the rain, a petite woman took a black helmet off, her appearance making Leonel's heart, which had been steady even through all of this, beat wildly.\nThe crimson droplets seemed to radiate beneath her aura, her amber eyes shining so brightly that they appeared to be golden. Her long hair fluttered in the wind, catching the moonlight like a waterfall beneath the cool night air.\n\"Aina…\"\nAt that moment, Leonel suddenly understood something.\nAccording to the analysis machines of the Empire, Aina's ability fell under the healing type. This had always been odd to Leonel because the way Aina had described her ability to him, it didn't seem to have anything to do with healing.\nBut now it seemed that he was wrong. Healing might very well be the foundation of Aina's ability and was the root of her strength. But, her healing must only work on her own body.\nAina probably guessed how things would go if they returned, but instead of stopping Leonel, she allowed him to go back and see the truth of the world for himself. It was possible that she had been healed for over a day already. No, maybe she never spent very long injured in the first place.\nWorried that they might be being monitored, she continued to feign her injuries to make them underestimate the pair and only made a move at the most opportune time.\nAina took out a jewelry headpiece and put it on. A small, fingernail sized gem dangled from her forehead, looking like a drop of water.\nThen, she turned toward Leonel and smiled lightly.\n\"You've done enough, I'll handle the rest.\"\n\"So beautiful…\" Leonel mumbled like an idiot.\nAina blushed profusely, her Valkyrie-like aura vanishing like a receding tide.\nFeeling embarrassed and seeing that Leonel still wanted to stare for a bit longer, she marched up the stairs, grabbed his wrist, and pulled him along. If she didn't do this, this little fool would stare for who knows how much longer. It wasn't as though they were out of the woods yet.\nThe moment she turned away from Leonel's bumbling appearance, her gaze turned cold.\n'This little fool really made an enemy out of the Ascension Empire just for me… In that case, anyone who stops me from taking him out of here can be cleaved in two.'",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 900 powerstones ... and we're apparently already closing in on 1200... *sigh*]\nIn truth, Leonel was a bit embarrassed that he never realized that Aina had been awake the whole time. He had done his best to ignore the fact she was on his back, or else he would have lost himself in the softness of her figure. How could he, a lifelong virgin, resist the feeling of those two soft things on his back. He ultimately had no choice but to practically ignore her completely.\nLeonel shook his head as he ran at Aina's pace. Now that he had lost a couple hundred pounds on his back, his fatigue didn't seem as bad anymore. Well, that and the fact he didn't seem to be needed.\nAina was like a one woman artillery unit. She didn't seem to need Leonel's help at all. He would only occasionally snipe some danger in the distance. Now that his Force wasn't restricted, it seemed that his Internal Sight increased almost tenfold.\nFrom what he could see, he had an area of sharpness and an area of vagueness. Within about 200 meters, he could see things as though he was looking at them with his own eyes. Between 200 and 1000 meters, everything gradually grew foggy until he couldn't sense anything.\nWhen he paired this foggy region with the primal instincts of the primitive consciousness, he was able to sense general areas which harbored danger and killing intent. Like this, he sent warning shots in those directions. Whether he hit them or not, he didn't care. He only wanted to disrupt their rhythm so they couldn't snipe at Aina.\nWhat Leonel couldn't have guessed was that Aina didn't actually need his help at all.\n\"Stop shooting, you'll only expose our exact location. Let them snipe. They won't be able to touch a hair on your head.\"\nWhen Leonel heard these words, he blinked. How had the roles reversed so suddenly? When did he become the damsel in distress?\nIt wasn't long before Leonel understood where Aina's confidence stemmed from.\nThey charged down the densely packed region of residential homes.\nFrom the inner city doors to the outer city gates, there was a main road that plowed straight through to connect them both. This wasn't exactly a great design as it made the Fort easier to breach if the main gates fell, but Leonel assumed it was like this for the sake of convenience.\nLeonel thought that Aina would avoid the main road. Their only advantage now was the fact there was only a pair of them. They should take advantage of this and try to find another exit. Leonel didn't believe the Leum family would be stupid enough to make a city with only one gate. It was possible that Miles had hidden the others with his ability. In that case, he just had to get close so that he could see through them with Internal Sight.\nBut, Aina didn't do this. She charged through the straight main road. If one came, she cut him down. If two came, they both lost their heads. If ten came, they fell all the same.\nHer efficiency was scary to the point Leonel felt numb. It took Leonel almost two hours to exit the inner city, but Aina seemed to be closing in on the Fort's gates in less than 20. Nothing was capable of stopping her.\nThe truth was that this was due to the fact the outer city had no Force disrupting towers, so the technology available was much weaker here. But, Leonel seemed to have forgotten this and only had endless praise for Aina.\n\"Halt!\"\nThe next poor commander stepped up, trying to stop them.\nUnfortunately, her fate was not much different than those who came before her. It wasn't as though the special units would all remain idle in the Fort. The one Aina took out in one fell swoop was the only one not stationed at a distant Perimeter.\nAina's eyes suddenly flashed as the bang of a sniper rifle rang out.\nLeonel's heart stopped. He could sense the bullet enter the sharp range of his Internal SIght and could see that it was perfectly aimed at Aina's forehead. But, he simply wasn't fast enough to stop it.\nWho knew that Aina would have begun moving even before the shot rang out? He was so lost in worry that he didn't even notice she had shifted her attention toward that direction long ago.\nHer ax swung downward, cleaving the bullet in two.\nWithout even a pause, she took another step forward and swung again, cleaving another bullet that was aimed for Leonel.\nLeonel blinked in shock. 'She wasn't faster than the bullet, she just acted before it could get here as though she predicted it…'\nA moment later, Leonel's gaze focused on the headpiece on Aina's head. It had a delicate necklace-like structure that wrapped around her head like a headband. The singular jewel it had dangled from her forehead like a clear drop of water.\nHe suddenly understood. Leonel received a Quasi Bronze Reward. How could Aina not receive one as well?\nAina turned back and charged forward again. Her ax alternated from taking heads to cutting down bullets. The way her body danced with that battle ax twice the size of her body made her look like a crimson fairy. The night was dark all around, with the sole exception of the red-gold aura around her body.\n\"… I know that my mind is my greatest weakness too. But this can help me cover for that. Just rely on me for now.\" Aina said confidently.\nLeonel finally understood. While he thought he had no choice but to bow to the demands of the Empire, Aina never even thought of that as being an option. She hid the fact she had this treasure, which was the reason why the wererat was able to catch her off guard. Now that the situation had reached this point, there was no reason for her to continue hiding it at all.\n'Good… I was worried that the Junior Governor Duke might come around for a last stand and catch Aina off guard. But if her mind is protected by a Quasi Bronze treasure that seems able to increase her perception, there's no problem then.'\nLeoenl felt that he could finally breathe easy. The way things were going now, even if he simulated it with his Dream World, the likelihood of them leaving this Fort unscathed was over 90%.\n'What should we do after we leave though…' Leonel frowned.\nEventually, he realized that the only option was to leave Earth. They stood no chance staying here. Their only option was to hope the dictionary could find them a high enough rank Zone to enter so they could earn a teleportation award to another world.\n'Uncle Montez will probably be able to tell me about which worlds are relatively safer and more accepting of outsiders…'\nLeonel was lost in his thoughts when it happened.\nThe explosion was so loud he couldn't hear anything for a long while. No, he could hear something. It was a loud, high-pitched noise. If Leonel had to pick something it reminded him of, he would immediately think of the flat-lining of a heartbeat. It was the kind of sound a hospital's emergency room would have on replay…\nBlood dripped from his ears and a searing heat assaulted him. It was like a wall of invisible fire had crashed into his body. The wind it came with was almost strong enough to knock him off his feet.\nThe heat was so excruciating Leonel had no choice but to close his eyes. The last sight he saw was Aina frozen in place in front of him. She was perfectly fine, but she seemed to be just as shocked as he was.\n'… They…'\nLeonel's mind went blank. He opened his eyes once more to find AIna in the same place. But, the residential homes that had been ahead of them were blown to pieces. A rain of stone and rubble fell all around.\nAs Leonel's hearing slowly came back, the first thing his ears latched onto was the screaming.\nFrom the start of Leonel and Aina's escape, they hadn't seen a single civilian. They hid and cowered in their homes, not wanting to get involved. Likewise… The two of them left them alone.\nBut now, their screams filled their ears like treacherous demons clawing at their hearts.\n\"Ha…\"\nLeonel's bottom lip hung loosely, a sound that seemed a cross of a sad laugh and a sigh escaping thanks to them.\nOn a distant tower, Miles watched on without a hint of emotion. They had only missed because the weaker technology they were strapped to without the Force disrupting towers was a bit lacking. But, he was confident that there wouldn't be a second time.\nHe didn't dare to use such a tactic in the inner city. Those people were nobility. But, what were these poverty stricken leeches to society worth to him?\n\"Fire again.\" He said coldly.\nAnother volley was launched. This time, its aim was true.",

      "content": "\"No!\"\nLeonel shook himself awake, dragging up what reserve strength he had managed to regain while allowing Aina to lead to swoop her into his arms. He tried to cover Aina completely, hoping that her ax could block the rest of the attack.\nBOOM!\nPain like nothing Leonel had ever felt in his life before assaulted his body. Without suspense, he was sent flying. He couldn't even tell up from down anymore, let alone telling just how far it was he had flown.\nThe Quasi Bronze chain necklace on his neck splintered. It was just a tiny crack, but it came with a sound almost as loud as the bomb itself. Or, maybe Leonel's sense of sound had just been completely thrown off as well. He really couldn't tell.\n\"Aina? Aina!\"\nLeonel roared, barely able to hear his own voice. Only after shouting with all he had did he faintly hear himself.\nAina's state was far more sorry than his own. He had tried his best to cover her back while her ax had covered much of her front, but her legs and some of her arms had been completely exposed.\nLeonel's blurry vision teared up when he saw her, a lump quickly swelling in his throat.\nHer legs had been charred beyond recognition. What was once delicate, fair skin was blackened beyond recognition. It was so bad that she didn't even bleed, even her blood itself seemed to have burnt to ash.\nHer arms were in a slightly better situation, but this somehow made it more gruesome. Severe burns of the fourth degree almost exposed her bones. Her flesh bubbled almost like water, producing a scene that made one's stomach upturn.\nLeonel's knees and palms surrounded her almost like a mother protecting her cubs. He wanted to scream and roar, but his inner organs didn't seem to want to allow that.\nBlood leaked from his orifices, partially obscured by the soot and grime that coated his body.\nLeonel quickly shuffled around in his pockets. When he found the bracelet he was looking for, he slipped it onto Aina's wrist as gently as he could.\nRegret filled his heart.\n'I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid. I should have given it to her earlier. Why didn't I give it to her earlier?'\nHe felt as though something was clawing at his chest and eating his flesh.\nHe had had this bracelet ever since he exited the Mayan Tomb. It was only a Tier 4 Black treasure, but since it was one time use, it was countless times more powerful than other treasures of its tier. He chose it just for Aina, so that he could protect her and help her.\nBut, when he saw her kill Conrad like that, he began to question everything. Even after he learned that she had killed Conrad for the sake of protecting Yuri, he still couldn't forget that scene.\nLeonel knew that he liked Aina more than even he, himself, could put into words. But, there was always a piece of himself that remained restrained, a part of him that couldn't accept her. So… He never gave her the bracelet he saw as the symbol of his feelings.\nHe was so stupid. Impossibly stupid. Regret was seeping through his veins like a venomous poison.\nLeonel roared like an enraged wild beast, ignoring the pain of his inner organs. He could hardly hear it himself, but it spread throughout the Fort like a shockwave.\n\"Fire.\"\nMiles coldly watched on, a disdainful glint lighting his eyes. His only regret was that such a good treasure would likely not survive the wreckage and would have to be buried along with them.\nTo the side, Simeon's expression was far more sadistic. He remembered Leonel's voice when he shot that bullet toward him just two hours ago.\n'Unfortunate'. Those were the words he had said. As though the interaction had been meaningless to him. Watching Leonel suffer like this after humiliating him like that made him the itch in his heart lessen.\n'It's too bad the child of that whore will die without repaying the family for the genes she was given. But, so be it.'\nLeonel's maddened roar was drowned out by the explosion.\nBOOM!\nLeonel felt the bones of his body fracture and crack as he slammed into something heavy. His vision was too blurred to see where he was, he could only barely tell with his Internal Sight. The only thing he knew for sure was that he was holding onto Aina.\n\"Li…\"\nLeonel heard a weak voice by his ear along with the splintering of another treasure. The gem of the bracelet he had just slipped onto Aina's hand fractured and dimmed, falling from its socket.\nAt first, he thought the voice was trying to say his name, but this wasn't true.\n\"Little fool… Take it.\"\nLeonel blinked, feeling something pressed against his chest. It was only after his senses were barely half recovered that he realized it was Aina talking and she was pushing something against his chest.\nHe looked down to find a tall and slender piece of paper between her hand and his chest. No, it looked too much like a piece of fabric to be called paper. However, all Leonel could see was Aina's hand. How she managed to continue holding on to her ax in one and lift the other to give him this thing, whatever it was, Leonel had no idea.\n\"This… Is a tick… et. Just pour… your Force into… it and… it will ta… ke you to… an… other… world. I've al… ready vet… ted it… it shou… ld be sa… fe.\"\nLeonel's expression flickered, his throat running dry.\n\"Fire.\" Miles once more said coldly.\n\"Ju — Junior Governor Duke, we can't do that. They've been blown too close to the walls. If we shoot again, we'll compromise the safety of the Fort. Some Invalids have already been attracted by the noise.\"\nWithin the tower, the commander of the post hesitated but still clenched his teeth to explain. He was already horrified by Miles' actions. Now that he had found such a good excuse, he had to make use of it. Miles might not care about the common people, but he at least cared about his own safety… right?\n\"Who cares, we'll just build another wall.\" Miles said coldly.\nThey had built such a great wall in such a short period of time. They could easily do it again. Not to mention the fact that it would just have to be a repair and not a complete reconstruction\nThis time, another official stepped in.\n\"Junior Governor Duke, the alloys we used to build the wall were all from emergency stores in case of a Class 9: Red event like this one. They've been used up already and we won't have the technology or safety to mine such ores again in the short term.\"\nEveryone held their breaths, waiting for the Junior Governor Duke's response.\n\"… Send all available units down.\"\nThey all sighed breaths of relief.\n\"You heard the Junior Governor Duke! Send down the orders!\"\n\"Wait.\" Miles suddenly stopped them, causing them to feel nervous once again. \"Call Tier 5 Admiral Bennett as well.\"\nBy the Fort walls, Leonel still hadn't realized he had been sent so close to his original goal. But, even if he had, he hardly had the strength to move now and there were enemies all around.\n\"… Take it!\" Aina spoke firmly. \"They won't… kill me. The… Bra… zinger family ne… eds me…\"\nShe fumbled around weakly and also managed to find a pill.\n\"This can … stimulate your… po… ten… tial for five minutes… but it… will leave… you we… ak for th… ree days af… terwa.. rd. Only take it if… you fi… nd dan… ger on the oth… er side…\"\nAina coughed violently.\n\"I look like… I'm in a … bad state but my … body will… heal soon… Don't… worry…\"\nLeonel gripped Aina's hand which had pressed against his chest once more.\n\"What world is it?\" Leonel asked with a gruff voice.\nAina's soft lips curled into a smile, seemingly happy that Leonel would ask this.\n\"It's called… Terrain…\" She laughed a little before chuckling. \"… It seems that… we aren't the… only ones with bad… naming sense…\"\nHearing that Aina's voice was slowly getting steadier, Leonel smiled, the grip he had on her small hand tightening slightly. It seemed she hadn't been lying. Her body really was recovering at an astonishing speed.\n\"You're right, Earth and Terrain really are bad names.\" Leonel responded lightly. His words seemed to put Aina at ease for a moment. But, she froze at what she heard next.\n\"Wait for me there. I'll come to get you with a present far better than that bracelet, I promise.\"\nAina didn't have the time to react before the paper turned fabric she had pressed against Leonel's chest was pasted onto her forehead.\nThe last thing she saw was Leonel's smile and the gentle, loving looking in his eyes before she vanished.\nA teleportation ticket could only work for one life form at a time. Even the Metal Spirit Aina had been holding onto for him couldn't follow her in.\nBut, Leonel was calm as he looked at the red pill in his hand. Without hesitation, he weakly stood and swallowed it.",

The cold within his gaze bubbling forth.\nMiles and Simeon felt a cold sweat mat their backs. For a moment, they found it difficult even to breathe, let alone move.\n'… It would take me 8 minutes and 36 seconds to make it there and kill them in this state… It's not enough time…'\nLeonel had never felt such a strong desire to kill. It was worse than just wanting to end someone's life. It was deep to the point of wanting to feel the warmth of their blood.\nHe was pissed.\nOf course, he was mad about not being able to kill them. But, he was even more pissed off about his own weakness.\nIt felt cliche. He was certain that he had read the same exact line in a hundred if not a thousand books, shows and movies before.

However, this wasn't the truth at all. What Leonel actually didn't like was the idea of someone dictating what it was he could and couldn't do. The feeling of someone cornering him like that left him enraged.\nEven he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life yet, so how dare someone else decide his course for him? Who were they to do such a thing? To treat him like a puppet on a string they could pull every which way they desired?\nThose innocent people who died today were just like that. Weak. Having their lives, their fates toyed with on a whim. Was he really much different from them?\nLeonel had never been an ambitious person. From a certain perspective, it could be considered to be one of his flaws. Maybe the only thing in his life he had ever truly wanted was Aina's answer to his confessions. That singular, childish want had actually pushed him to such an extreme. He didn't even really remember how it happened, but here he was. He was now an enemy of the Ascension Empire behemoth.\nThat was how simple Leonel was. Such a small thing yet he was willing to go so far for it.\nAina wasn't the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, that was Joan. She had only ever said his name once. He didn't even feel that he knew much about her.\nIt was just a feeling. It was a feeling that told him that there was no better woman to be by his side. So, he strove to make that happen. It was nothing more and nothing less.\nIf others heard his thoughts, they would think that he was crazy. Such a man… If he ever had ambition… If he ever had something he wanted to accomplish… Just how scary would he be?\nHowever, now, Leonel wanted a second thing.\nTheir heads. Until he had both of their heads leaking with blood before him, he wouldn't rest.\n'The next time I come, I'll make you pay for taking Aina from me.'\nThese were his true thoughts. He didn't mention the innocents who had fallen even once. This was somewhat cruel… But it was human.\nLeonel turned toward the tall silver walls of the Fort. He was not even a hundred meters from them now. With the strength flowing through his body and his shoes, it wouldn't even take him 30 seconds to leap over it, defeat the guards on the walls and leap down to the other side.\nHowever, it was at that moment he suddenly heard a familiar voice.\n\"Let me go!\"\n'… James…?' Leonel frowned, looking back.\nBy now, many guards had long since surrounded Leonel while he was deep in thought, they were even within ten meters of him. But, Leonel had simply ignored them, not sparing them a glance.\nHowever, he hadn't expected to hear James' voice here.\nJames' father was a Tier 5 official. Even among those in the inner city, his status was high. While Miles dared to brazenly kill commoners, James shouldn't have been in any danger. So, what was going on?\nWas Miles this stupid? He could still keep control of the situation before, but if he started targeting nobles too, he wouldn't be able to keep hold on power for long.\nLeonel's gaze landed on James who was about 20 meters away, struggling under the control of a man with his face obscured by a black tactical helmet. Even in the dark, it was easy for Leonel to make out the gun to James' temple.\nOne of the commanders who hadn't moved due to the overwhelming pressure emitting from Leonel sneered, his knees still trembling somewhat as he drummed up his courage.\n\"Obediently allow yourself to be captured, or else your friend will suffer a fate worse than death.\"\nLeonel stood somewhat at a loss, giving the units who had been surrounding him more courage.\n\"Leo! Don't listen to them! Just run!\"\n\"…\"\nLeonel didn't say anything for a long while. In reality, it was barely five seconds, but those five seconds somehow seemed like an eternity.\nHowever, to those watching, it only seemed natural. Wasn't he just struggling, trying to decide whether to escape with all his might or save his best friend? But, the words Leonel said next left them at a loss.\n\"James. Are you sure you want me to kill him?\"\nLeonel's voice was calm and even. This was already shocking enough, but the words he said were even more ridiculous. What did he mean by that?\nJames suddenly hesitated, his face painted with confusion.\n\"I've never seen your father before.\" Leonel started slowly. \"But, this only makes sense. My father retired from his Tier 5 position and I don't come from a large family, so it only makes sense that I'm not worthy of rubbing elbows with the Bennett's too much.\"\nThe more Leonel spoke, the paler James became.\n\"People about six feet tall aren't rare, but those who could be as tall as you are quite a small percentage. You have an A-grade defensive ability, compared to others, what you should fear the least are low class guns that can function without Force disruption. Lastly, it would be quite stupid for Miles to turn on the nobles that help him keep everyone in line, don't you think?\"\nLeonel continued to calmly speak as though not sensing more and more units closing in on him.\n\"So, I will ask you again, James.\n\"Are. You. Sure. That. You. Want. Me. To. Kill. Him.\"\nLeonel's words were like a hammer taken to a stake at James' heart.\nSeeing that James didn't respond, Leonel shook his head.\n\"I'm disappointed… I really… took you as my closest friend…\"\n\"Bullshit!\" James suddenly roared. \"You pretend to care about so many things, you pretend to be kind hearted, but all you really care about are things ending up exactly like you want them! You don't like killing only because you don't want to deal with the guilt! You don't like playing football only because you didn't get to choose it! You only want to do things your way and nothing else matters!\"\nLeonel frowned. He couldn't make sense of the jumbled mess James was speaking. He could feel that this 'friend' of his had had this on his mind for a long time, but he wasn't eloquent enough to put them into words in any sort of short and concise way. Even more so, Leonel didn't know where this was coming from.\nYet, somehow, even without a true cohesive line connecting his thoughts, James' words seemed to stab at something deep within Leonel's heart.\n\"You're a fucking sociopathic hypocrite!\"\n\"…\"\nLeonel looked toward James who was bordering on hyperventilation. There was a slight hint of pain in the depths of his eyes that he was unable to hide.\n\"… I don't know whether or not the things you said are true.\" Leonel finally responded. \"I really don't care about many things. Goals? I don't have any yet. When my father mentioned the fact that my mother was actually still alive… I didn't feel much. In all my life, I never even asked him about her.\n\"There are very few things that I am certain of. The first is that I love my dad. The second is that Aina is the woman for me. The third was that you were the person closest to me outside of my own dad… but it seemed that this was me being too naive.\n\"What I do know, though, is that regardless of what reasons you have… At this moment, you're trying to push me toward my death.\"\nJames' face became as white as a sheet. No matter how hard he tried, he simply didn't have a response.\nLeonel turned toward the man holding a gun to James' head.\n\"I hope it was worth it using your son like that, Mr. Bennett.\"\nLeonel turned and left. Of course, there were numerous attempts to stop him, but they were all foolhardy. Miles even grit his teeth and fired the canons once more, not caring for the damage that was done to the walls, but Leonel simply used his shoes to leap out of the range of the explosion.\nWithout the burden of Aina and her ax, and being so close to the walls thanks to Miles' mad volleys, Leonel survived within his five minute timer.\nWith that, he vanished.",

      "content": "Leonel walked slowly, using his silver rod to hold himself up.\nHis once handsome face was obscured by soot and grime, his brownish-gold hair loosely hanging downward. One could barely see his pale green eyes between its strands, but what one could see would make it impossible not to shiver.\nThere was some sadness in there. After all, now Leonel had no one. His father had gone off on his own to some unknown place, Aina was now on another world, and now, the last person he thought he could trust on Earth had turned on him as well.\nCompared to the horrible things truly unfortunate people have to deal with, this wasn't much. However, to Leonel, who had never really suffered in his life, it was a huge blow.\nHowever, this wasn't what would shake people to their core. What was so shocking in those eyes was the coldness. An indifferent, calculating coldness.\nLeonel hadh't even left the range of the Fort's influence, but he was calculating. Like an emotionless machine, he ran through plan after plan, each of which would lead to the death of Miles and Simeon.\nAs he watched them die in his Dream World again and again, the gaze in his eyes grew colder… more inhuman.\nThe faint lights of dawn could be seen on the horizon. Soon, the night would end and the sun would rise.\nLeonel's steps only grew slower and slower, his body becoming less and less able to hold itself together.\n\"Since you're already here… Is there a need to continue hiding?\" Leonel spoke plainly.\nHe had noticed this person long ago, but hadn't said anything. He had been hoping that this person would come out and attack him. To the current Leonel, sooner was better. His body was already in a sorry state. If he was forced to continue, he wouldn't be able to take another step.\nLeonel had thought of pretending to find a place to hide and rest. Like this, he could wait for this person to make their move then. However, he felt that if he lied down now, his body would shut down.\nAt that moment, a shadow slowly came out.\nHe looked like an oriental man with dark black hair and eyes. But… that was the only thing normal about him. The weird things were almost too numerous to list, but even the short version could make one's expression twist weirdly.\nFor one… The man was completely naked. He wore not a single thing. Other than the weird chain from his neck that held a card that dangled from one of its links, the sniper rifle strapped to his back, and the knife in his hand, he had nothing else on him.\nSecondly… His body was covered in tattoos. In the 24th century, a tattoo artist teamed up with a leading expert in biological nano technology to create what they called 'Vision Tattoos'. They were essentially tattoos that moved along one's body in a repetitive, loop-like fashion. Almost like a 'gif' from the 21st century.\nIf it was just the fact this man had a vision tattoo, it would be fine. But… why was his vision tattoo a porno?\nIt was so weird that Leonel didn't even think to ask himself why it was the technology of the vision tattoo seemed unaffected. His virgin eyes couldn't leave the plump woman being plowed by three men at once. He couldn't help wondering if she was okay…\nThe third weird thing about this man was the fact that half of his body was covered in bandages. Yet, not only had he chased Leonel, but he was actually smiling so masochistically, as though he was enjoying his own pain.\nWho else could this person be if not Xinghai?\n\"… I wanted to wait until we were out of the range of the Fort so that no one would interfere in our battle, but I didn't expect your body to be so weak now. I bet if that Junior Governor Duke knew this, he wouldn't have given up chasing you so quickly.\"\n\"Are you finished?\" Leonel asked without much of a change to his expression.\nXinghai didn't get mad at such words. Instead, he sighed.\n\"It's a shame. You were good prey, but I don't have the time to wait for you to recover. Plus, I'm injured too and it's your fault. So, things are fair, don't you think?\"\nXinghai licked his lips and took a step forward, but what he saw next made him freeze.\nLeonel flicked his wrist and a grenade appeared out from his spatial bracelet.\n\"Since that's the case, let's die together.\"\nLeonel smiled, yet it seemed colder than even Xinghai's own. Before Xinghai could do anything, Leonel pulled the pin.\nHowever, despite the panicked look on his face, Xinghai was internally sneering.\n'This idiot.'\nXinghai laughed within his heart. Then, he prepared his blink ability and activated it. However, what he saw in the last moment before he disappeared made his eyes squint in confusion.\n'… He threw the grenade away from us…? What…? Oh no!'\nBANG!\nThe sound wasn't from the grenade. Leonel had chucked it so far away that compared to this bang, it was nothing.\nWhen Xinghai appeared once more, he found a gun placed onto his chest, its hot nozzle burning his skin.\nHe looked up at Leonel in shock. Then, fell over. Dead.\nLeonel watched indifferently as the last of Xinghai's life faded. At that moment, he felt like his arm was about to implode. Without Force disruption towers, the recoil mitigation technology of the handgun didn't work anymore, so he had to take the brunt of it himself. However, even though he was prepared, it had still hurt like hell.\n'It's too bad that you talk too much…' Leonel thought, walking toward the card that Xinghai had hung from his neck in curiosity.\nThe moment Xinghai gave Leonel too much information to deduce some things from, he was finished. He never stood a chance. Even he had no idea, even in death, how Leonel had seen through him so easily.",

      "content": "[Bonus chapter for 1500... next week there will be bonus chapter per 350 powerstones instead >;] ]\nThe moment Xinghai said his injuries were caused by Leonel, it made the latter think of a few things. There was no one he injured like that. Could it be that Xinghai was referring to the canons Miles was using?\nBut, when Leonel saw the sniper rifle on his back, he realized something else. Could this have been the sniper he shot at? Shouldn't he be dead? Leonel had been very confident in that shot…\nThat was when Leonel understood. If that sniper managed to survive, there was an 84% chance that he had an ability that allowed him to do so.\nJudging by Leonel's observation, there was a 7% chance this ability was defensive and a 91% chance that this ability was evasive. It was less likely to be defensive, or else Xinghai wouldn't be so injured. Leonel then decided that this ability was either related to high speed, some sort of invulnerability, or potentially teleportation.\nIn the beginning, Leonel had given teleportation the lowest odds because he intuitively knew it must be a rare high class ability. However, when Xinghai stepped toward him, Leonel realized his speed stat was far too low, so teleportation moved up a rank. That left invulnerability and teleportation.\nSo, Leonel set up a test with the grenade. He didn't believe that Xinghai's ability was impregnable, or else he wouldn't have been injured. He also didn't believe that Xinghai's ability had a long duration, or, again, he wouldn't have been injured.\nThis led Leonel to ultimately conclude that Xinghai's ability was short term invulnerability or short distance teleportation. Regardless of which it was… He was finished the moment he took Leonel's bait.\n'This is really too inconvenient.' Leonel shook his head. 'If I didn't have to speak out loud to the dictionary, I wouldn't have to go through so much trouble. It could have just directly told me what I needed to know…'\nThis event was one no one was destined to know about. It happened in a place without spectators and Leonel didn't even seem to care much about it. However… If others were to know what happened here… How Leonel, an 18 year old boy, played a Five Star Arms Professional to death while barely able to stand on his own two legs…\nThe world would come to know that a monster had awakened.\n'Slayer Legion?' Leonel's eyes narrowed as he looked at the card Xinghai left behind.\nThe Slayer Legion… It was a name not many knew about. This wasn't because they tried to hide themselves. It was quite the opposite, actually. There was nothing this group wanted more than to be widely recognized and renowned. However, they were always pressed beneath the thumb of the Ascension Empire.\nThe few who knew its name were either high ranking government officials or other unlucky individuals that happened to be present during one of its many attempted and failed campaigns.\nBy now, those who were clever enough had likely already guessed exactly what this 'Slayer Legion' was. It was precisely the rebel army that dared to face up against the mighty Ascension Empire.\nIn order to dehumanize and emasculate the rebels, the Ascension Empire suppressed news of them to the extreme. It was to the point that many weren't even aware that they had a name at all.\nLeonel didn't expect Xinghai to be affiliated with them. He was quite bold to wear it around on his neck like that. But, then again, he didn't exactly seem like a normal individual.\n\"The rebel army, huh…?\" Leonel flipped Xinghai's card in his hand. \"… I'm not interested in joining, but I can probably use these guys to kill them faster…\"\n**\nIn the lofty Ascension Province, there was a palace that stood as tall as a mountain. Beautiful golds and silvers were all around, displaying an impossible to grasp majesty.\nWithin the royal court, nobles from all across the land were gathered. If one were to not be aware of the Metamorphosis, it would be impossible to guess from this place that such a horrible event was going on. Let alone how immaculate the Ascension Palace looked from the outside, even much of the Ascension Province seemed completely unaffected.\nStill, despite how many powerful men had gathered here, there was one man who had so much presence that they were all completely drowned.\nHe sat on the throne with a light smile on his face. He looked to be quite old based on his wrinkles, maybe almost 60 years old. But, he had a youthful exuberance that rivaled a 20 year old man in his prime.\nHis hair was a bright white-gold that almost seemed to radiate its own light. His eyes were like two green emeralds, twinkling as though they were gems. His beard was full and almost looked like a lion's mane, but it was so meticulously groomed that not even a single strand was out of place.\nHe was handsome to the point of being inhuman and charismatic to the point of being untouchable. He had the kind of air that made it impossible for one to continue holding onto their anger before him.\nHe was Emperor Gervaise Fawkes. The man who wielded the most power on Earth.\nAt this moment, a man kneeled before him with an ugly expression, explaining a great many things that he listened to seriously.\n\"Outrageous!\"\nOne of the nobles roared as they listened to this story.\n\"Two children actually dare to be so brazen just because they were awakened as Variants?! What is your Royal Blue Province doing, Governor Duke Leum?! You can't contain two commoners?!\"\nThe kneeling man wore an ugly expression, but he didn't refute, waiting for His Majesty's response. He knew that his enemies in the court wouldn't allow him room to maneuver now that his son had made such a big mistake. The only option was to come clean. Hiding it would only make things worse.\nSuddenly, the Emperor began to laugh. The laughter was so jovial and happy that the Royal Court was stunned silent.\n\"Leonel Morales is it? HAHA!\" Emperor Fawkes continued to laugh. \"You're asking me what to do about a teenage boy? Do whatever you want, go all out. Kill him if you can, though I doubt you'll be able to.\"\nThe words left them speechless. What was going on…?\nHowever, Emperor Fawkes continued to laugh.\n\"Killed a few nobles? Killed several thousand commoners? Disobeyed direct orders? So what?!\n\"If you can, you can go ahead and kill him. In fact, if anyone can kill him, I will reward you greatly. The second Province we clear after the Ascension Province will be yours if you succeed.\"\n\"… Pardon…?\" Governor Duke Leum thought he must have heard incorrectly. That must be it… right?\nUnfortunately, Emperor Fawkes continued to laugh.\n\"Leonel, is it? My daughter truly gave me a great grandson. Kill some more, rampage some more, who cares? A Fawkes man should be exactly like this.\"\nGovernor Duke Leum directly fainted. He collapsed to the ground, willing what he had just heard away in his dream land.",

      "content": "The Ascension Royal Court was in an uproar.\nThey all knew that Emperor Gervaise Fawkes had had two children in his lifetime — his eldest daughter and his younger son. The talent of the latter didn't need to be mentioned. Whether it was his intelligence, elegance, or personal strength, not a single one was lacking.\nHowever, despite his talent, the Emperor never formally handed the Crown Prince title to him despite it being tradition to do so. No one was aware of the reason why. But, Gervaise Fawkes was a near mythical figure. Those who dared to question his decisions simply didn't exist anymore.\nWhen it came to the princess, though… they were completely in the dark. The last time she was seen, she wasn't even ten years old. Since then, she hadn't made any public appearances. No one knew where she was.\nIt was only now, with the help of the Emperor's words, that they were aware that she was not only alive, but had married and even had a child? How could it be that the Nation's First Daughter could be married without them being informed? Just what sort of secret was hidden behind this?\nOf course, many of them thought it was some sort of conspiracy. But, this idea was quickly thrown out. If it was as simple as the Princess disobeying her father and marrying a man he didn't accept, why would she disappear before she even turned ten? It can't be that she got married as a toddler, right?\nIn addition, judging by the Princess' age, she should be about 65 years old right now. But, her son was only 18. So, what secrets could have filled the time between her 10th birthday and her 47th?\nRegardless of what the truth was, the royal court was at a loss.\nThe Emperor was encouraging them to go out and kill Leonel if they could, and even promised such mouth watering rewards. But…\nWho of them actually dared to take the first step?\n**\nAfter the daily gathering of the Royal Court ended, the Emperor could be found silently meditating, a radiant smile on his face.\nSwirls of Force slowly entered his body. Compared to Leonel, the speed was much slower. But, it seemed that he was taking his time as though taking a nice, slow paced stroll.\nIf one looked closely, it was possible to see the deep lines of wrinkles on the Emperor's face slowly receding. A long while later, he looked to be even younger than he had this morning.\n\"Imperial Grandfather.\"\nSeeing that the Emperor had finally opened his eyes, a young man with sharp brows humbly kneeled before him.\nThe young man's hair was also a bright white-gold, albeit a few shades dimmer than the Emperor. It seemed that the genes of the Fawkes were quite strong, because his eyes were also a deep shade of green.\nHe had a handsome, confident bearing. His shoulders were wide and powerful. And, though he didn't dare to bring a weapon in the presence of his grandfather, the calluses on his otherwise blemishless hands proved that he was adept at using one.\n\"Noah… Why have you come to see this old throne?\"\nThe Emperor's smile didn't fade. He looked no different than a grandfather chatting with his grandson.\n\"… I have a cousin?\" Noah asked, probingly.\"\n\"Of course. You've had a cousin for 18 years already. You're just a little older than he is.\"\nNoah felt a bit frustrated by this answer. The Emperor obviously knew what he meant by asking this question. The point wasn't that he had a cousin, the point was about why this was hidden.\nHowever, Noah had known his grandfather for long enough to know that it would be useless to ask directly. He had to find another way.\n\"… Are you really going to allow those nobles to try and kill him?\"\nThe Emperor's smile deepened.\n\"Yes.\" He replied. \"A talent isn't worth much if it's grown in a greenhouse.\"\n\"A talent…?\" Noah's jaw involuntarily set. \"Is he more valuable to you than me, Imperial Grandfather?\"\nOne might expect a grandfather put in this sort of situation to go out of their way to settle the hearts of their grandson, but the Emperor did nothing of the sort. Instead, he pondered for a while before nodding as though this was obvious.\n\"His mother is more talented than your father. And, his father is beyond what your mother could imagine. Isn't this just the logical conclusion?\"\nNoah felt his heartbeat slow as though it was sighing in resignation along with him. This sort of answer, he wasn't surprised by it. What he was surprised by was the latter part of the statement.\nBeyond his mother? His father was born on Earth but his mother… How could that be? Just where did Leonel's father come from to gain such an evaluation? It even faintly sounded like even his Imperial Grandfather, a man who wasn't scared of anything, held some faint reservations about this man.\n\"If it's like this, Imperial Grandfather, why did cousin not grow up with me?\"\nThe Emperor remained silent, continuing to smile at Noah. But this only made the latter feel as though he was being drowned in his own sweat.\n\"Those who grow up in good environments often end up being useless.\" The Emperor finally replied.\n\"But…\"\n\"You're wondering why I say his father and mother are both better than yours, yet in the same breath also say he didn't have a good environment to live in?\"\n\"… Yes.\"\nThe Emperor's smile deepened. \"It's the same reason why your mother can't actively take part in your life just yet. Did you think she didn't have a reason for this?\"\nNoah's eyes widened. This was the first bit of happy news he had gotten since this conversation began. It was a simple sentence, but he felt it suffocating him with joy.\nOf course, what Noah didn't know was that despite not being able to actively take part… Leonel's father still stayed by his side despite the restrictions. As for why his Imperial Grandfather hid this important piece of information, it was impossible to tell.\nFeeling much better, Noah smiled brightly.\n\"Imperial Grandfather, I would like to leave the Ascension Province and seek out cousin. Then we can face his coming challenge together. You said that a talent in a greenhouse isn't worth much, right?\"\nThe Emperor shook his head. \"No, this is his challenge, not yours.\"\nNoah quickly lowered his head, realizing that he had gotten a bit too ahead of himself.\n\"However… if you're going off to try and kill him, I can allow you to go.\"\nNoah felt as though he had been dunked into an ice bath. He flexed his muscles with all of his strength, trying to stop his own trembling. But, the Emperor continued as though he didn't notice his grandson's odd state.\n\"Those Tier 7 officials are really too useless. I could tell that none of them would have the backbone to act. Maybe only that Governor Duke Leum would do something when he's pushed into a corner.\"\nThe Emperor's smile deepened.\n\"That said, not everyone is useless. That Brazinger family and those like them are foolish enough not to fear me, those Tier 8 and above officials as well. Should be an interesting time for your little cousin.\n\"I have great expectations for the little guy, HAHA! What a good grandson, a good grandson indeed.\"\nThe Emperor laughed for a while longer before turning back to Noah.\n\"Go on now, LIttle Noah. There are a lot of starving dogs that have turned their eyes on our piece of meat. And, there are some larger ravenous beasts that want to take a chunk out of our Earth.\n\"You and your cousin will be the figureheads of your generation. Don't disappoint me.\"\nIn his laughter, the Emperor's aura had leaked from his body. The presence was so imposing that Noah almost lay down flat on the ground. He felt that he couldn't drag up the courage to do anything in opposition to this man.\n\"… Yes! Imperial Grandfather!\"\n**\nIn the basement wreckage of a collapsed building, Leonel sat against a dusty wall with his muscles spasming in pain. However, his face remained completely expressionless.\nTo an outside observer, it almost looked like all sorts of snakes and insects were wiggling beneath his skin, yet Leonel didn't seem to notice. His mind was focused on something completely different.\n'The Segmented Cube swallowed up that sniper's dead body too… It can't be that it wants me to eat his corpse like I did with the octopus… right?'\nIf Leonel had the spare strength he needed to form them, he would definitely be shedding tears right now. Why did his father leave him behind such a perverted treasure?",

The feeling of having your body split apart out of your control, yet only being able to lie on hard, stone floors was really too unbearable. If he had a tent treasure like Yuri had, this would be much more convenient.\n'Yuri… I wonder if she'll be okay…'\nLeonel frowned at this thought. The only reason why he was able to escape the outer city was because he only had to worry about himself. He knew that going back to get Yuri was impossible. If he had, they both would have died.\nHe was worried about more than just Yuri. He had no idea if Miles would try to make use of his teammates against him or not.\nLeonel shook his head. He knew there was no point in thinking about these things. He just had to grow stronger.\n'Since I can't move, what can I do?'\n\"Hey, do you know why the Segmented Cube took in the corpse of that sniper?\"\n[ *Ping* The corpse is useful ]\nLeonel frowned. \"Why is it useful?\"\n[ *Ping* The abilities of existences at and above the TIer 7 Black grade condense within the Ethereal Glabella Evolution Crystals. Force Crafters can refine these into limited use items. ]\nLeonel was speechless. Though this was better than having to eat the corpse, was it that much better? Something about using a human body to refine items made him feel uncomfortable.\n\"Wait…\" Leonel suddenly thought of something. \"… Does that mean that the octopus was taken for that reason as well?\"\n[ *Ping* Replying to Seed, yes. ]\nLeonel's lip twitched. The sniper's ability might really be useful to him, but wouldn't he have to grow tentacles in order to make use of the octopus' ability? Where was the cool factor? How could he show his face to Aina again if he did such a thing?\n\"Hold on a second, the Segmented Cube is a lab, right? Doesn't that mean I should be able to enter it?\"\n[ *Ping* Yes. ]\n\"Then why the hell am I still here? It can activate on its own to take that pervert's corpse but can't see that I'm struggling out here?\"\nLeonel took out the Segmented Cube, fuming. He didn't know if there was anywhere comfortable to rest in the lab, but it should at least be cleaner than this dusty place, right? How could it treat him like this? What kind of weird fetish did this cube have to have to like corpses more than the living?\n\"Hey, little guy.\" Leonel knocked on the cube with a knuckle. \"Can you let me in?\"\nThe Segmented Cube vibrated, then separated into its pieces once more. Leonel felt his vision go black and, a moment later, he found himself in a small ten by ten by ten meter space.\nOn the outside, out of Leonel's vision, the pieces of the Segmented Cube floated around where Leonel had just been sitting. Its jigsaw-like pieces were connected by a faint white light, taking up the same amount of space as Leonel could see from the inside.\n\"This is the lab?\" Leonel blinked, unaware of what was going on outside.\nLeonel struggled to stand and looked around.\n'The Force concentration in this place is a lot higher.' Leonel's brow raised.\nOn one side of the lab, there was a silver rack filled with what looked like snowglobes. But, Leonel's eyes widened when his gaze landed on them.\nWithin two of the snowglobes, he could see the corpse of the octopus and that sniper floating. It seemed that they had been compressed and placed inside. Leonel guessed that this must be the lab's method of preservation.\nOther than the silver rack, Leonel found the bookshelves and cubicles filled with scrolls his dad left behind on another side of the room. In the middle, that odd table with half-spherical wells that was in the basement was here as well. Though, Leonel wasn't certain of what it could be used for.\nThinking of something else, Leonel reached into one of the large pockets of the tactical gear he had stolen from the Fort and brought out the Metal Spirit.\nThe little guy bounced around like an elastic ball, pinging around the confines of its cube as though still trying to escape. But, Leonel could tell that it was just excited.\n\"Why is this little guy so excited to be here?\" Leonel asked.\nHe thought he would find some great treasure here, but aside from the rack of snowglobes, there really wasn't anything else special.\n[ *Ping* Replying to Seed, Spirits need high concentrations of Force and their preferred element to grow and evolve. The half Metamorphosed Earth is akin to a barren wasteland for it. In comparison, the Segmented Cube's inner space is much better. ]\n\"The Segmented Cube can generate Force?\" Leonel asked expectantly.\n[ *Ping* No. ]\nLeonel frowned. It can't generate Force? Then why is the concentration so high? At a moment like this, he really hated that the dictionary only ever answered his questions directly and hardly embellished.\n\"Why is the Force concentration so much higher here, then?\"\n[ *Ping* The Segmented Cube has a sterilization ability. ]\n\"Explain this ability to me.\"\n[ *Ping* Replying to Seed ]\n[Sterilization: The refinement and purification of Force. ]\n\"So the concentration of Force here is dependent on the outside world? What Dimensional grade has it reached?\"\n[ *Ping* Yes. The current concentration is about equal to a Mid-level Fourth Dimensional World. ]\n\"Mid-level? Worlds of the same Dimension are separated as well, huh…\"\nLeonel forgot his pain in all his curiosity. He only wanted to learn more and know more. He found all of this fascinating.\n\"… Wait! The concentration of Force… If I use the lab, wouldn't that make Invalids come after me? Crap!\"\nLeonel panicked for a moment. He had already been in here for several minutes. This was more than enough time for Invalids to close in on him.\n[ *Ping* No. The lab is able to hide its Force activity. ]\nLeonel's eyes widened before he began to laugh wildly. He was only forced to stop after he felt his lung might come flying out from his throat. This pain was really too unbearable.\nHis progress had always been limited by those damned Invalids. Even if he was still in the Fort, it wouldn't make a difference due to those Force disrupting towers. But now, with the lab, he could practice [Dimensional Cleanse] without worry. Wasn't this fantastic?\n'I'll have to wait for my body to recover before I can do any Force cultivating. But, in the meantime, I can do other things…'\nAina said he would feel weak for three days. So, during those three days, his healing would be exceptionally slow. After those three days passed, though, his body would be able to slowly recover at a more normal pace.\nAs for how long it would take him to recover after that? Leonel didn't know. But, regardless, since the lab could hide him from Invalids, there was no need to move from this place for now.\nLeonel's mind ran wild for a moment. What was the best use of his time?\nAfter a while, Leonel made a decision.\nHe walked to the odd table and took out two ores, a pair of gloves, a quill, and finally, the Metal Spirit.\n\"How do I make this little guy my official Familiar?\"",

Usually, the dictionary would respond right away, and even if it didn't, it would tell him that the information was omitted. So, what was going on?\nA moment later, the hologram of his father gained life to it once more, causing Leonel's eyes to light up. It seemed his father had left more than one recording behind. Since this one activated now, it must mean that this was quite important.\n\"You finally activated this, little cry baby?\" Leonel's father shook his head. \"It's about time.\"\nLeonel bit his teeth and remained silent, he refused to fall for the same trick twice. His father had gotten him once, but if he got him a second time, he would never live this down. So, he only silently watched as his father picked at his ears.\nLuckily, it seemed that his father was already satisfied after tricking him once.\n\"I'm not certain which Familiar you've managed to get your hands on, but if it's a Metal Spirit, good. If it's not, it's still good. Regardless of how useful a Familiar is to you, remember to treat it like a partner and a friend. If I find out one day that you've treated it as a tool, I'll peel a layer off your ass with my palm.\"\n'… So vulgar…' Leonel almost couldn't refrain from rolling his eyes.\n\"If you're smart, you've probably understood from my words that the most important part of a relationship between a Familiar and a Force Crafter is friendship and intimacy. The more in sync your hearts are, the better the results will be.\n\"If you've managed to find a Metal Spirit, just say 'Yes' and the dictionary will direct you to that recording.\"\n\"Yes.\" Leonel replied\nLeonel's father smiled, pushing up his glasses.\n\"Lucky, lucky. Metal Spirits are fairly weak in the infancy stages. In fact, before our Morales Clan took them to be our favorites, they were quite looked down upon by the Force Crafter world. Most other Force Crafters prefer Flame Spirits.\n\"Before one even gets to the Metal Spirit, there are a whole host of Familiars one might think of first. Wind Spirits are especially beloved by those who focus on the Force Art aspect of Force Crafting. Natural Intelligence Spirits have calculative minds far beyond that of us humanoid creatures. The list goes on and on…\n\"However, a Metal Spirit, especially when combined with our Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, has been widely recognized as one of the best. Those with Metal Spirits are the best at crafting small and intricate parts. This may sound like a meaningless thing, but everything starts with a foundation.\n\"Nothing large and complex can be created without the small and simple. Thanks to this, our Morales Clan has a reputation in craftsmanship that puts dwarves to shame. One day, when you're confident, take a look at the mechanisms of that dictionary I left you. That day, you'll be able to see the prowess of our Morales Clan.\"\nLeonel's father laughed heartily.\n\"Anyway, I will get to the point. The simple answer to your question is that you can't. Making a Familiar your official companion is a long process. There's no such thing as making it submit. Well… there is, but I would never allow you to do such a thing. In fact, if you ever come across someone who has, you should directly kill them.\"\nThe coldness in his father's voice made Leonel shiver. His father had never said something even remotely close to this. In fact, much of the reason Leonel's moral code was like it was, was due to his father's guidance. It was his old man that taught him his kindness. To abruptly say such a thing was too… jarring.\nLeonel's father shook his head as though feeling he had said something he shouldn't have. He hesitated for a moment. Leonel felt like his father was trying to decide whether or not to delete the recording and start again. But, in the end, he decided to press forward and leave things as is.\n\"… All you can do to make a Familiar accept you is treat them well. There will come a time where you two become inseparable. Take it to nice environments, treat it to nice food, and don't keep it imprisoned for too long. Let it roam free, it won't easily leave the side of a person it's familiar with. After all, in the beginning stages of its evolution, it's not much more than a child.\"\nLeonel nodded in understanding.\n\"The last thing to do is to give it a name and train by its side. Metal Spirits, in comparison to other spirits, have a very high demand on the dexterity of their partner. I've left a step by step training plan for you in the dictionary to be used alongside blueprints that were in my office.\n\"Remember, the most important thing is your personal strength. Do not spend too long on Force Crafting. Your old man has made this mistake before. If I wasn't so fascinated with it in my youth, I would be ten times more powerful than I am now. But, I had to give others a chance, if I really was any more powerful, the universe might not be able to accept my existence anymore, HAHA!\"\nLeoenl smiled and shook his head. If he knew that his old man really wasn't joking, then maybe his reaction would have been a bit different.\nAfter the message ended, Leonel took a deep breath and walked to the Metal Spirit. It was still bouncing around crazily.\nWhen it noticed Leonel had appeared above it, it plopped down and formed a little puddle as though pouting. Leonel really couldn't help but think that it was quite adorable.\n\"Well… Be free little guy.\"\nAs soon as Leonel opened the lid of the transparent cube, the Metal Spirit shot up like a spring and hit the ceiling. Then, without a pause, it rebounded across the room.\nLeonel smiled as he watched it. He thought the little guy might have some resentment toward him for keeping him locked up for so long, but it really was like a child. Its memory was short and the only feelings it seemed to have for Leonel were those of gratitude for setting it free. It didn't seem to remember that it was only locked up to begin with because of Leonel.\nAfter a long while, the Metal Spirit grew tired of its new environment and settled down onto the table. Force began to whizz around it, disappearing into its little body like a typhoon.\nLeonel watched on silently and allowed it to do as it pleased.\n'It seems that the Force the lab can sterilize at once is limited. I can already faintly feel it dissipating. That probably means that I'll need to wait for the lab to replenish itself every time I finish using [Dimensional Cleanse]… That's fine, it's still better than not being able to practice at all.'\n\"Alright, what's the first lesson that old man left behind for me?\"\nLeonel decided not to bother the Metal Spirit for now. Since Leonel himself couldn't use the Force in his current state, he might as well leave it to the little guy.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Book One: The Basics ]\n[ Lesson One: Hazards ]\nLeonel nodded. At least his old man was serious when it came to this sort of stuff. The dangers should be the first things he learns about, lest he almost kill himself again like the time he foolishly modified a Force technique.\n[ 1. Metal Spirits ]\nLeonel frowned. 'Metal Spirits are dangerous? Then why did dad say to let it free. Don't tell me this old man is trying to get me killed…'\n[ Metal Spirits are highly corrosive lifeforms. Their instinct is to devour. In order to evolve, they need to consume large amounts of Force and high level minerals. Unfortunately, Evolvers happen to have high concentrations of both. It is advised to never allow skin to skin contact with a Metal Spirit. Even veterans who have been by their partner's side for many years can still suffer at the hands of their Metal Spirit Familiars. ]\n[ Whenever you are handling a Metal Spirit, be sure to wear the proper defensive gear. The minimum requirement is a pair of Force Skin Gloves. However, for a beginner, a full Force Skin Suit is more appropriate. ]\nLeonel looked up at the ceiling above his head, the grief evident in his eyes. His old man really was trying to get him killed.\nThe good news was that he now knew what those gloves Montez gave him were.\nThe bad news was that those gloves were a mere minimum requirement, yet they were all he had. To make things worse, he had set them on the table when he brought the Metal Spirit out. And now… The Metal Spirit was swallowing Force from right on top of them.\nLeonel suddenly felt that the little guy had become much less adorable.",

Feel free to comment your suggestions, I'll pick the one with the most likes :) don't be dirty, think of the children :'< ]\nAfter this slip up, Leonel realized that he was most definitely not in the best state to continue pushing himself. He didn't know what he was thinking. He still hadn't slept a wink since the matters with the weremen and his body was collapsing on him. It was best that he set this aside and come back when his mind was fresh.\nLuckily, after this, Leonel learned some useful things about the lab.\nFirstly, the state of the lab was dependent on the amount of Force it had access to. Since this was only a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional World still in the process of completing its Metamorphosis, the lab could only enter what the dictionary called: Phase One.\nSecondly, each Phase had two settings. One was the Lab Setting and the other was the Abode Setting. The Lab Setting was self explanatory, but the Abode Setting was geared toward resting and recovery.\nLeonel was so happy he almost shed real tears. After entering the Abode Setting, the Metal Spirit was left in the Lab Setting, allowing him to breathe a sigh of relief.\nThe Abode Setting of Phase One had one main attraction. It was a pool that was eerily similar to the one Montez allowed Leonel to bathe in. According to the dictionary, it was filled with Black Grade Soothing Waters. Leonel assumed that it could be improved by entering Phase Two.\nThe Black Grade Soothing Waters weren't very beneficial to increasing his strength any longer. But, it was perfect for speeding up his recovery.\nThat said, what Leonel loved the most about the Abode Setting wasn't the pool, but, rather, the bed. He wasn't sure if it was simply because of how tired he was, but he swore it was softer than a cloud. Without a doubt the best bed he had ever slept on.\nLike this, Leonel did nothing in the next three days but sleep, eat octopus meat, and recover in the Soothing Water pool.\n**\nOn the fourth day, Leonel dressed head to toe in the tactical gear he had stolen from the Fort and cautiously entered the Lab Setting to find the Metal Spirit still snoring away on top of the Force Skin Gloves.\nThough Leonel inwardly cursed, he still resolved himself. He was already about 80% recovered by this point, so he felt his mind was much clearer.\nMaybe the smartest thing to do would be to use the cube that had imprisoned it before to move it away, but Leonel took his father's words to heart. This little guy was meant to be his friend, his companion. Clearly, he didn't like being imprisoned. In that case, Leonel didn't want to antagonize him.\nThe rest of the process went surprisingly smoothly. The Metal Spirit, maybe due to having absorbed so much Force, was quite languid and just slipped right off the black gloves. If it wasn't for the little bubble it formed and popped on its surface to greet Leonel, the latter would have thought it hadn't noticed at all.\nBreathing a sigh of relief, Leonel slipped the gloves on and left the little guy alone. For now, he still didn't know enough to interact with it. Then, he began his studies in earnest.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Book One: The Basics ]\n[ Lesson One: Hazards ]\n…\n[ 4. Finger Strain ]\n[ To a Force Crafter, your most important treasure isn't your partner, but, rather, your fingers. It is important not to execute complex movements before you're ready or else you can cause irreparable, hidden and lingering injuries to your hands. These injuries can often build artificial bottlenecks to your progress. Refer to Book One: The Basics - Lesson Two: Stretches and Strengthening… ]\n…\n[ 9. Force Art Reactions ]\n[ Force Arts are an incredibly complex subject matter, even the most accomplished Force Artists would never dare to say they know everything. This is why it's important to blueprint your ideas and test their feasibility. If two Force Arts clash and react violently, you may die before you know what happened. Refer to Book One: The Basics - Lesson Five: Force Art ]\n…\n[ 17. Reactive Metals ]\n…\n[ 23. Third Dimensional Electrical Engineering ]\n[ 24. Fourth Dimensional Electrical Engineering ]\n…\n[ 37. Overfeeding and Metal Spirit Potential ]\n…\nSomeone else might have been overwhelmed, but Leonel soaked in everything he saw as though he was a sponge. He didn't seem to get bored or tired. In fact, a very familiar aura began to spread from him the moment he began learning in earnest.\nTo Leonel, it had never mattered whether he loved to do something or not, he always took it with the utmost seriousness. In fact, compared to other things, since his father loved Force Crafting so much, he had a better opinion of it as well. So, of course he would try his best.\nBefore he knew it, he had already cleared the first Lesson of Book One and moved on to Lesson Two.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Book One: The Basics ]\n[ Lesson Two: Stretches and Strengthening ]\nUnlike Lesson One which listed a seemingly endless barrage of hazards, Lesson Two focused entirely on what Leonel's father claimed was his most important tool. Instead of learning Force Crafting skills, Lesson Two was all about exercises… for his fingers?\n[ 1. Flexibility]\n[ … ]\n[ 2. Speed ]\n[ … ]\n[ 3. Strength ]\n[ … ]\n[ 4. Dexterity ]\n[ 4.1 Precision ]\n[ … ]\n[ 4.2 Acceleration ]\n[ … ]\n[ 4.3 Deceleration ]\n[ … ]\n[ 5. Force and Your Hands ]\n[ … ]\n[ 6.

His dad was really asking for too much.\nUsually, one could begin the first applications of Force Crafting as long as you reached the Tier 1 Black level in all Grade One exercises. But, Leonel's dad was asking him to reach a level of hand and finger strength only those on the verge of becoming Bronze Grade Force Crafters would have.\nTo put this matter in perspective, not all Force Crafters would even reach Grade One designation before beginning to work on Bronze Grade crafts. Most would only complete all Grade One exercises to a Tier 6 Black level before moving on.\nHowever, thinking of his father's smug face, Leonel grinned. That old man was so proud of his Force Crafting. What kind of face would he have if Leonel surpassed his requirements?\nAbove the Grade One designation there was the Advanced Grade One designation and the Superior Grade One designation, each for the SS-grade and SSS-grade level respectively.\nUsually, only those who had Force Nodes in their hands could reach the Superior Grade One designation. But, Leonel already knew where his next Force Nodes would go and knew his hands weren't appropriate locations for them.\n'In that case, Advanced Grade One designation it is. First, the flexibility exercises…'\nLeonel's eyes shone brightly as he began to move his fingers according to the exercises his father left behind. If there was one thing he loved to do, it was win. And now, he was competing against the phantom of his father.\nA competition across generations.",

      "content": "Leonel completely lost himself in a new world. Though he wasn't sure about why he had to do all of these hand exercises just yet, Leonel had already completely forgotten about that curiosity. His mind was entirely focused on the target he had set for himself.\nAccording to his father's training program, flexibility was the very first step to training the fingers of a Force Crafter. Without flexibility as a foundation, everything else would come harder. The flexibility exercises were almost like a mechanic diligently oiling even the smallest components of their machines, building it up so that even the smallest corners were in top working condition.\nOnly after laying a foundation of flexibility would Leonel turn his attention to strength and speed. Upon reaching this step, Leonel would begin working in dexterity exercises which would teach him how to use his newfound strength and speed.\nOf course, everything would once again circle back to flexibility. Every training day began with and ended with stretches. At the end of it all, there would be a cycle of recovery.\nAfter about two weeks, Leonel felt that he should heed his father's advice. Focusing too much on Force Crafting would be detrimental to him, especially since it wouldn't help him take down Miles and Simeon.\n'I've been here for a while, yet no one has come.' Leonel narrowed his eyes, looking down at the wrist watch still strapped to his arm.\nThis thing was his greatest worry. He always felt that it was only a matter of time before it was used to track his location.\nBefore, Leonel could only take the risk of staying in the same place. After all, if he could be tracked, whether he moved or not wouldn't make much of a difference. In fact, moving when he was heavily injured would only negatively impact him.\nBut after so long, nothing had happened. He had even almost forgotten about it.\n'Hm, maybe it's jammed just like all the other technology? I remember that after the Paradise Islands fell, it went completely silent. It wasn't until I entered the Mayan Tomb that it showed signs of life again… Maybe I only have to worry about it inside of a Zone then?'\nLeonel could only accept this line of thought. Regardless, he wasn't afraid.\nHis body had recovered completely by now and he even felt that it was stronger than it had been in the past. He felt that this might be because more of the residual effects of his dad's vomit brew were being released again.\nHe wanted to know more about that, actually. He even asked the dictionary about it. Unfortunately, he got an *Information Omitted* response in return.\n'I guess I should enter the Spear Domain again.'\nLeonel took a deep breath and got up to leave the Lab Setting.\nBefore he could, the little guy jumped up from the table and landed in his palms, snaking around his fingers and hands as though saying goodbye.\nLeonel smiled. Since he had the Force Skin Gloves on, he wasn't worried.\n\"I'll be back tomorrow.\"\nA bubble formed on the Metal Spirit and popped with a *Boop* sound before the little guy hopped back onto the odd table with wells.\nHe still hadn't given the Metal Spirit a name. He wanted to listen through Lesson Three first since it seemed to be important in understanding the relationship between a Metal Spirit and a Force Crafter. He didn't want to make another stupid mistake that could be avoided.\nSoon, Leonel had made his way to his bedroom after going through Grade One recovery treatments for his hands. Then, he laid down comfortably, not wanting to bash his head on the floor again, and stretched his Internal Sight toward the Spear Domain ring.\nWHOOSH\nLeonel felt his body go light again as though his consciousness had been forcefully sucked out from his mind.\nWhen his vision cleared, he was once again in that hellish spear graveyard.\nDark reddish black skies hung above his head, spears of all shapes and sizes were dotted around him, and a heavy pressure that might crush him at any moment rested on his shoulders.\nThis time, Leonel understood a lot more and didn't blindly begin to walk around. He had questioned the dictionary thoroughly before coming here and had learned a great many things.\nFirst, this wasn't his real body, it was a manifestation of his self formed of his Soul Force or spirit, as Leonel preferred to call it. Second, there was a constant pressure being exerted on him not by the world, but by the spears themselves.\nEach spear was connected the consciousness of the owner it had previously. These consciousnesses were the equivalent of the state Leonel was currently in. As such, they exerted pressure on Leonel's spirit form.\nThe closer a spear was to that massive mountain peak that pierced the skies ahead, the more powerful the consciousness and thus the harder it was to walk forward.\nAt Leonel's current strength, it was already a miracle that he could survive in this place. Usually, it would only be possible after grasping Spear Force. Only then would one be able to resist the pressure of the spears here. However, Leonel's ability gave him a great buff to his spirit that allowed him to circumvent this.\nRegardless, Leonel could only take a single step and touch a single spear before his spirit gave out. So, he had to be more selective this time.\nHe had gotten great gains from the primitive spear he took out last time, but he didn't want to take up a spear like that again. In order to make full use of the primitive man's combat ability, Leonel had to sink his mind into the same state. However, Leonel wasn't a blood thirsty, battle hungry kind of person. He preferred to be calm.\nWithout sinking into that primitive mindstate, Leonel could at best use about 70% of the primitive man's abilities. This wasn't bad, actually, as it taught him a lot. But, it could be better.\n'I'm not good enough in the spear to use his abilities without just copying him, which is why I need to sink into that mind state… But, if I learn more and build a solid foundation for myself first, I'll be able to use 100% without changing my demeanor.\n'For now, I need to find a spear that meshes with my personality better. Something calm and calculating, but filled with a firm resolve…'\nLeonel took his time, quietly scanning each spear in range of a single step of him by turning his head. He didn't dare to reach out with his Internal Sight, or else he'd be blown away without even being able to choose.\nAfter a while, Leonel smiled bitterly. Without his internal sight, he really couldn't make a decision. It was because of his Internal Sight that he had been able to pick out [DImensional Cleanse] before. But now, he could only rely on his eyes. He didn't know enough about spearmanship to make judgments like this.\nLeonel took a deep breath. 'I guess I can only choose randomly, then.'\nAfter a while, he made a choice and reached forward.\nThe spear had a wooden shaft as well, much like many of the spears in this starting line, but it wasn't crudely made like the primitive spear. It was made of a flexible, light wood that was about 1.8 meters in length. Its blade was just as thin as the shaft and was formed with four sides like a prism. The shade and tip were separated by a golden colored wrap which the feathers of a colorful bird hung from.\nIt was quite a beautiful spear. Though it was made of cheap materials, it was clear the craftsman cared about his or her work, which was why Leonel chose it.\nBut, it was a decision he instantly regretted.\nOnce again, he found himself in an all new world, but he didn't even have the mind to take a look around because… when he looked down he found that his chest had suddenly grown two massive, soft mounds. And, as though that wasn't bad enough, there was a distinct cold draft of wind sweeping through his legs.\nWhy was he wearing a dress…?",

      "content": "Leonel could only keep his tears to himself. Since he wasn't able to control himself when he entered the consciousness of the spear owner, he could only be a passive observer.\nThe world itself was nothing special. It didn't have the exotic feel that the jungle of the primitive man had. Instead, it seemed to be a small village, not much different from the first village Leonel and Aina landed in the France Zone.\nThe woman was currently practicing her spearmanship on a few wooden targets. The moment Leonel set his sights on her movements, he completely forgot how aggrieved he was just moments before.\nEach of her strikes carried a blinding speed with them. The slight whistling of the wind that came when it reached the end of its acceleration made Leonel internally shiver. It was perfectly timed every time. Her spear would always reach the peak of its speed just before it hit the target and would leave a hole so perfect that the four sides of the spear's blade could be clearly seen.\nIt reminded Leonel of a venomous snake. Her spear would lull one to sleep then suddenly accelerate, only biting down when it had reached its optimal potential. Though she wasn't as savage as the primitive man, Leonel could still sense her underlying venom. She held an ideology no less vindictive and blood thirsty than the primitive man had.\nA loud whistle caught the attention of both Leonel and the woman whose body he was in.\nThe lady was soon approached by a group of three led by a young man with a bare chest rippling with muscles that seemed carved of steel. They immediately began speaking in a language Leonel couldn't understand, but, quite frankly, he didn't need to understand to see the leering and lewd gazes they looked at him, or rather, her, with.\nIt was only now that Leonel was no longer distracted by the woman's spearmanship that he got a good look at exactly what kind of beauty he was in the body of. If she were to be described in just a few words, Leonel would choose: stimulating to an impossible degree.\nLeonel realized now that if there was no guarantee that the spear would have a male owner, then there was probably no guarantee that the spearman would be human either. This woman was definitely not human. Even if he was beaten to death, Leonel wouldn't believe that she was anything other than a succubus.\nShe wore nothing but two pieces of beast skin clothing. One was a strapless wrap that binded her chest, and the other was a short skirt that didn't even make it midway down her thighs. And, as though that wasn't enough, there was a slit on one side, exposing even more of her legs.\nHer skin was dark, soft and flawless. Her every movement seemed to emphasize the flexibility of her body — the way her hips winded like a pendulum, the way her breasts bounced with her every slight movement, even the way her hair waved in the wind.\nIf Leonel wasn't fused with her body, he would likely appreciate the view even if he didn't react much to it. But, since he was, he felt jittery and uncomfortable. This feeling only got worse when the woman seemed to start flirting with the three men as though she would take them back to her home for a round far more wild than anything Xinghai had tattooed to his body.\n'Please, for the love of all that's holy… Don't do this to me…!'\nUnfortunately, the woman didn't seem to hear Leonel's screams. Or rather, this world was never designed for her to be able to.\nShe continued to flirt with the three men, making suggestive comments and displaying her tantalizing figure without restraint or embarrassment.\nHowever, by the grace of some god up above, when the three men extended what Leonel interpreted as an invitation, the lady turned them down. Then, she said something that must have been an insult because the leading man turned red with rage.\nThese men probably thought it would be simple to vent their rage, but what happened next left Leonel, who wasn't even the target of the succubus-like woman, shivering.\nHer spear was like the stinger of a murderous wasp. Due to the design of her blade, her array of attacks were all variations of a piercing motion. Yet, even with the lack of variability provided by hacks, chops and slashes, her moves seemed impossible to deal with.\nNo matter how Leonel simulated, no matter what tricks he used, no matter how hard he tried, he realized that there would only be one conclusion if he were to battle this woman…\nDeath.\nShe toyed with her enemies, a seductive smile curling her soft lips as she stabbed toward them again and again.\nThe three men tried to run away after their pride had been crushed, but the succubus' speed was too dazzling. She fluttered around like a butterfly, cutting off the escape of three of them with ease and a beautiful smile on her face.\nAt some point, other people of their village converged to watch the good show. It wasn't long before Leonel realized that this wasn't 'their' village at all. Rather, it seemed like these three men were outsiders who had been completely ignorant of this woman's power, and now they were paying the price for it.\nLeonel lost count of the number of bloody holes that filled their bodies. They screamed in agony, wanting to die, but the woman didn't seem intent on letting go of her playthings.\nA long while later, the screams of the men finally died down.\nBlood marred the practice grounds, but not a single drop had touched the seductive beauty. In fact, that same smile was still on her face, looking toward the three dead bodies as though they were a masterpiece rather than the corpses of three men who had just been living and breathing.\nIn that moment, the woman's consciousness seemed to turn toward Leonel, something that shocked him greatly. He felt a cold sweat cover his back as her eyes seemed to invite him to play as well.\nHe startled awake, shooting up from his bed. The heaviness of his breath hung in the air as he tried to breathe, his chest heaving.\nA long while later, he looked at the spear in his hand, his calmness returning to him. A cold gleam was sparked in his eyes. This wasn't exactly the consciousness he was looking for, but Leonel felt that it suited him quite well.",

      "content": "[Bonus Chapter for 700 powerstones :) The chapter for 1050 coming soon]\nThe location was a bustling harbor.\nHalf a dozen ships were docked parallel to the shore, each of them with a large ramp coming out from their sides. It was possible to see many crewmen rushing up and down these ramps. Some of them were pulling large pieces of cargo, others were casually chatting, and a small few were barking out orders from on high.\nThe ships themselves were quite an odd sight to behold, especially in the 25th century. Instead of being magnificent steel behemoths, they were all ordinary wooden ships. In fact, they all had sails and a lower level that seemed to have slits for long armed oars.\nThe dozen ships weren't very large at just about 40 to 50 meters in length. However, off the shore, a distance away, it was possible to see a large mother ship at almost 200 meters in size. It seemed to be overlooking the operation.\nAt that moment, a young man made his way from the distance toward the harbor with slow steps.\nHis hair was messy and long, colored with a brownish gold. It swayed in the wind, occasionally covering the glow of his pale green eyes. His face had a hint of a slowly maturing immaturity to it. The start of a youthful and unkempt beard was beginning to line his jaw, giving him a gruff but handsome appearance.\nHe was dressed simply. A pair of sweatpants and sneakers graced his lower half while his torso was fitted by a tight long-sleeved and black compression shirt that shimmered with hexagonal patterns. There was even a silver chain with an almost imperceptible crack hanging from his neck.\nHe was the kind of existence that was all too rare after the Metamorphosis descended. If it wasn't for the exquisite spear on his back, one would think he was nothing more than an ordinary teenage boy.\nBut the oddity still remained obvious. The boy was too… clean. How was it possible for a lone traveler to cross the Province so casually? He even looked like he was having a nice stroll.\nHis face didn't carry the heaviness one who had just put their life on the line should carry. In fact, he seemed carefree. If it wasn't for the calculating flicker that passed his eyes every so often, one would think he was naive.\nOf course, those tasked with guarding the perimeter of the harbor immediately noticed this young man. After all, he didn't try to hide his presence at all. But they were left at a complete loss. How were they supposed to handle this situation?\nObviously, their task was to repel weak Invalids and report strong ones. But, there wasn't exactly a protocol for handling a lone human boy…\n\"Hello.\"\nThe boy's voice snapped them out of their shock. They couldn't help but feel embarrassed that he was the one to speak first. Any hope they had had of establishing who was in charge was thrown out the window.\nIt really wasn't their fault though. Who walks through a city of Invalids so casually, even to the point of wearing a smile on his face?\nThe scouts on duty looked at each other.\n\"Who are you? State your name and purpose.\"\nSomeone of the team of three finally stepped out and said this. Though he was trying to reclaim some face for his scouting squad, the slight tinge of red on his face showed that he was better at hiding his embarrassment and thickening his skin compared to others. That was about all.\nThe young man smiled and took a card out from his pocket.\n\"My name is Leonel Morales, I'm here to join the Slayer Legion.\"\nThe eyes of the three men sharpened. Their unprofessional attitude vanished and their backs became as straight as javelins. Leonel could tell by their stats that they were much weaker than he was, but their auras alone showed that their experience in battle was far beyond his own.\nThe scout who had stepped forward first looked Leonel up and down. The more he looked, the more suspicious Leonel became to him.\nHow else could a teenage boy come out from that death trap alone without a scratch on his body? Even his clothes were immaculate. The only explanation seemed to be that he was a spy.\n'… It can't be that the Empire would send such an incompetent spy, right?' The scout's brow furrowed in confusion.\nIn the end, he shook his head. He was a scout, not a commander. He would leave this decision to the bigwigs. At this point, if Leonel really wasn't a spy, that meant he was powerful enough to travel alone unscathed. Their Slayer Legion was always in need of helpers.\nPlus… That was an invitation card in his hand. An invitation card likely meant he had already been scouted and chosen by their leaders. In that case, he had even more reason to bring Leonel in.\n\"You two stay here.\" The lead scout said. \"I'll bring him in.\"\nThe two remaining scouts watched Leonel disappear with their partner with deep apprehension.\n'They're cautious, but still not as cautious as I thought they'd be…' Leonel thought to himself. '… If the Slayer Legion is run by anyone with half a brain cell, they've most definitely taken advantage of the Metamorphosis to infiltrate the Fort. In that case, it's very likely that they've heard of me before, this should make things easier on me.'\nLeonel was well aware that he would be seen as a suspicious entity if he came here so openly. But, he was banking on his being a fugitive to make things smoother. It was unlikely that they'd conclude he was a spy like this.\nSoon, Leonel was brought over to one of the smaller ships. He followed the lead scout beneath the deck and down a well lit corridor with a much wider width than he was expecting.\nEverywhere he passed, odd gazes fell onto him. It was obvious that everyone here was quite familiar with one another, so the sudden appearance of a stranger had them all putting their guards up.\nThe knocking of a knuckle onto hardwood woke Leonel from his thoughts.\n\"What is it?\"\nA rough voice entered Leonel's ears. But, he could faintly tell that it had a feminine quality to it.\n\"Captain Sela, I've brought a … defector.\"\nThe lower deck seemed to freeze. Many who had been walking around, going about their business, stopped and looked toward Leonel in unison.",

He wasn't the type of person to get stage fright, he only wished their gazes would be a little less intense.\nThat said, Leonel didn't blame them. After all, it was indeed true that he wasn't very sincere in joining them. He only wanted to make use of them in order to take down Royal Blue Fort. As for the future? Leonel really hadn't thought much about it.\nWithout knowing exactly what kind of association the Slayer Legion was, he wouldn't casually put all his eggs in a single basket. And, even though Earth was his home, the matters revolving around James, not to mention the Brazinger Clan, was making it seem less and less homely to him.\nIt was obvious to him by now that his father wasn't from Earth. In that case, didn't that mean he had a home somewhere else?\nThe only use Earth had to him right now were the Zones it produced. He needed to either clear the first SS-grade Zone or clear an SSS-grade Zone so that he could exchange a Tier 9 Black reward for a ticket to Terrain. This was all he wanted.\n\"… Come in.\"\n\"Go on.\" The lead scout ushered toward the door.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. \"Aren't you going to follow me in?\"\nThe lead scout and the others who had been staring at him had weird expressions on after hearing his question.\nAfter a while, Leonel understood their intentions. It seemed that they had quite a bit of belief in this captain of theirs. Clearly, they didn't believe he had the ability to harm her on his own. They were confident to the point of not even caring to enter along with him.\nTo such a thing, Leonel could only shrug. He pushed the cabin door open and entered. What he saw, though, left him a bit speechless.\nLeonel never thought that he would ever have to use the word 'burly' to describe a woman, but there really was no better descriptor for Captain Sela.\nShe was a large woman of almost seven feet tall. She was shaped like a round tank with towering breasts that still somehow managed to be smaller than her large gut.\nOne might call her fat, but when Leonel looked toward her, he didn't have that thought. The reason was simple. Though she could be described in such a way, her body was still brimming with power. Leonel even saw through that her speed and agility weren't low at all, even approaching 1.00.\nCaptain Sela stood from a chair she seemed to trust far too much and walked over toward Leonel. She was silent, but her steps made Leonel feel as though she alone was causing the ship to sway.\nWhen she was just half a meter from Leonel, she stopped, towering over him.\n'Despite how she looks, she actually smells quite nice… Why is this scent so familiar, though?' Leonel's brow furrowed slightly.\nCaptain Sela looked Leonel up and down. She seemed curious about him. The boy didn't fear her and even allowed her to get so close without flinching. There were very few people within the Slayer Legion who could do such a thing. It was either that this boy possessed some real strength or that he was simply ignorant to the point of stupidity.\nIt was a full minute before Captain Sela felt that she had observed Leonel for long enough. Someone else might have felt too embarrassed to continue on for so long, but it seemed that this Captain didn't care.\n\"What's your name?\"\n\"Leonel Morales.\"\n\"Is that so? I'm aware of the names of all those the Slayer Legion reaches out toward, but your name has never been mentioned. In that case, why shouldn't I execute you as a spy right now?\"\nLeonel inwardly cocked an eyebrow. He had only told the lead scout that he had come here with an invitation card, but he had yet to tell Captain Sela this. However, after a moment, he realized that the card was still in his hands. After observing him for so long, it would be quite negligent of the captain to miss something like that.\n'She remembers all of the names…? I doubt that. As an organization that wants to take down the Ascension Empire, they're definitely extremely cautious. Someone I could meet so easily definitely doesn't have high security clearance so there's no way she would have access to so much information.\n'Even beyond that, let's say that I'm wrong and am simply overestimating this Slayer Legion. An organization like them would definitely need to send out tens of thousands of invitations at worst. If they didn't, they would never have the manpower they needed to match up against a behemoth.\n'There are some risks that come with recruiting on such a large scale, but I doubt the Legion cares about the Empire finding out. Most of the invitations are likely smokescreens. With so many invitations likely sent, it's impossible for her to remember all of the names.\n'In that case, there's another reason she's sure this invitation isn't my own. The first possibility is that invitations come with tiers of their own, this might be a high level invitation. If it is, there are probably less people who receive it, so it might indeed be possible for her to know that my name isn't on the list.\n'The other possibility is my age. I'm too young. There are too many loopholes to exploit here. The Legion might not send invitations to those as young as me. It's also possible that young recruits are on a short list as well, making them easier to remember.\n'Of course… The last possibility is that she's just guessing.'\nLeonel found his mind running like this all the time these days. He had always been a calculating person, but his ability had amplified it several times over.\nIn just a split second, he had already nailed down several theories, one of which was correct. But in Leonel's mind, it simply didn't matter which was the truth. All he needed to know was that Captain Sela was trying to play mind games with him. And, in that case, he could play some games of his own as well.\nLeonel smiled. \"If I took this invitation from someone else and was worried about how you might react to this, why would I tell you my real name? The truth is that this invitation isn't mine, I just happened to pick it up. But, my sincerity is true.\"\nCaptain Sela's eyes narrowed. Leonel wasn't wrong. If he was a spy, he would be the most incompetent spy in history.\n\"… You'll be given probationary status. All Shackled members will retain this status. In the meantime, I'll take you to get your ability and strength registered.\"\nWhen Captain Sela said 'Shackled', Leonel could feel her gaze shift over to his wrist watch as though it was a plague. However, toward this, he could only smile bitterly.\n'Does this mean that they have a method of removing this thing?' Leonel's eyes narrowed. 'In that case, it's even more worth it to stay if for nothing else than this.'\nWith that, Captain Sela took Leonel to be registered, but it seemed that Leonel was destined to be unlucky.\nWhen he wanted his abilities to be underestimated so he could fly under the radar, he was suddenly exposed as a legendary Variant. But, now that he wanted the Slayer Legion to approve of his abilities as quickly as possible so he could move up the ranks…\n[*Beep*]\n[Subject: Leonel Morales]\n[Ability: *Name Unassigned*]\n[Ability Type: Sensory]\n[Ability Grade: D]\n[Margin of Error: Critical]",

      "content": "Leonel felt a headache coming along. He had forgotten to take into consideration that the technology the Empire had access to versus the technology the rebels had access practically belonged to two wholly different worlds.\nWhen Leonel first entered the Mayan Tomb, he had thought that his ability was D-grade because of his wrist watch. It wasn't until later that he realized his ability's potential was too great for such an evaluation. In fact, according to his father's dictionary, his ability was graded as a Quasi Bronze Grade ability, meaning it was on the verge of surpassing Earth's current limits. Simply put, his ability was already a half-step beyond the SSS-grade.\nUnfortunately, the parts of his ability technology on this level could comprehend was too limited. It only sensed a small increase to his perception, but not much else. Other than acknowledging that there was a high amount of error, the machine didn't respond to Leonel's tears.\n\"D-grade, huh? Not the best, but not too horrible, I guess. As a sensory type, you'll be pretty good for scouting. We've been planning on expanding our perimeter units anyway.\"\nCaptain Sela casually spoke, not noticing Leonel's darkened expression.\n\"I was wondering how you managed to get here unscathed. It seems that your sensory ability should be good even amongst D-grade abilities, hm? A critical ranked margin of error, though? I've never seen this display before…\"\nLeonel sighed. There was nothing much he could do about this. He really hadn't used his sensory abilities to make it here. Well, he had, but not in the way Sela thought. He had even sought out opponents. The only reason he looked so clean was because of the self-cleaning function of his silver chain necklace.\nSeeing that Leonel was just an average talent, the curiosity the other crewmen had toward him lessened. D-grade talents? They had too many of them. Still, it was a bit of a relief that he wasn't an F-grade talent.\nIt was widely known that F-grade talents were of little use. In addition, since Leonel's ability type wasn't physical, he was more useful than a usual D-grade talent as well. Overall, he was a decent addition, but nothing worthy enough for them to take time out of their busy schedules to inquire about.\n\"Alright.\" Captain Sela clapped her meaty hands together. \"I'll assign you to Scout Leader Zhang. You've come at a good time, we still have a bit more things to do before we set off, so this is a good time to train new recruits.\"\nAs though trying to shoo Leonel away, Captain Sela passed off her duty of leading him to someone else.\nIn truth, it was already a huge show of respect for her to lead Leonel to his assessment personally. She probably saw something special in him when he faced her without fear. But it seemed now that of the two options — him being powerful versus just being ignorant — the latter was the truer statement. In that case, she had no reason to stay around him as the Captain of her own ship.\n**\n\"You're the new recruit? Leonel Morales, is it? A sensory ability? Good, good.\"\nThe Scout Leader was quite a skinny, willowy man of average height. His body wasn't very impressive especially since he seemed to be getting on in age, but his eyes were sharp and his tongue was fast. Leonel guessed he wouldn't only be good at scouting, but would be a great undercover agent as well.\nCaptain Zhang spoke quickly, not allowing Leonel the chance to get in a few words for himself. Originally, he had thought that the others just thrust the new recruit to him because they all looked down on scouts. But, seeing that Leonel had a sensory ability, his mood brightened.\n\"Usually, those bastards in upper management just throw the useless trash to me and expect them to come out like treasures. Why those useless idiots don't understand just how good scouting can save lives is beyond me…\"\nLeonel was speechless. He thought that everyone was scared of Captain Sela, but this Scout Leader Zhang disparaged her without regard for even his own image.\nIt wasn't like Leonel was the only one here either. Even the recruits he was taunting as useless trash weren't all that far away.\nAs the scouting unit, they didn't have a ship of their own. Rather, they were separated between the ships. So, it could be said the Scout Leader Zhang was the only Captain-level personnel without a ship to command on his own.\nSince they were currently docked, the scouting units were given a large military tent to act as their temporary base. The tent alone was at least 10 meters tall and 20 in radius. So, it was safe to say that most, if not all, of the off-duty scouts were here. But, he didn't hide his voice at all.\nAfter ranting and praising Leonel for what seemed like hours, Captain Zhang finally passed him on to a man by the name of Malt.\n\"You'll be placed in Scout Leader Malt's squad. Ask him anything you want to know about. Depending on your performance, we can talk about your future prospects at a later date.\"\nCaptain Zhang gestured toward a man almost a head and a half shorter than Leonel. He seemed quite young, not even 30, but he was already balding. Despite this, he had a wide smile on his face as he happily greeted Leonel.\n'… Scout Leader?' Leonel had a weird expression on his face.\nCaptain Zhang was called Scout Leader by Captain Sela. But now, Captain Zhang was calling someone else Scout Leader?\nMalt laughed heartily and put his arm around Leonel's shoulder. It was quite a comical scene since he had to stand on the tips of his toes, but he didn't seem to mind at all.\nHe began to whisper in Leonel's ears as though they were already close friends.\n\"I'll let you in on a secret, little brother. I heard through the grapevine that Captain Sela and Captain Zhang were once quite… close. It didn't end well, apparently. So now, they're always at each other's throats and never hesitate to take subtle jabs at each other.\n\"Captain Zhang's biggest insecurity is that he doesn't have a ship of his own to command. But, Captain Sela always pokes like this, dropping his Captain title and calling him Scout Leader.\"\nThough Malt continued to speak as he led Leonel toward their destination, the latter was internally shivering.\nHe couldn't help but remember how big and burly Captain Sela was. Then he compared that to Captain Zhang's skinny figure and his graying hair…\n'What an… interesting couple…'\nIt seemed love really was blind.",

One of them seems to be a D-grade mind control type Invalid. The other four are F-grade Invalids under its control.\"\nLeonel's Internal Sight focused on a group of five Invalids. Four of them had what looked like leeches at the base of their skulls. The Invalid that controlled them stood in the center with tentacles coming out of her head.\nIn the past, Leonel would have cringed at such a sight, but he had gotten used to it by now. Those who successfully awakened usually managed to avoid any weird mutations. But, Invalids — who were essentially the ones who failed to awaken their abilities and thus lost control of their minds — weren't so lucky. Many of them had obvious deformities just like this.\nOf course, those who were successful in awakening their abilities weren't guaranteed to not have mutations. But, most could hide them until their ability was needed.\nFor example, the metal A-grade Invalid Leonel met long ago. Had he successfully awakened his ability and not become an Invalid, he wouldn't have to walk around like a metal man all the time.\n\"Oof. Mind control types are the hardest to deal with. Luckily it's just a D-grade one. Good job, little brother. We'll handle it from here.\"\n\"HAHA!\" A hard slap hit Leonel's back. \"Great job, rookie. I'll go bash them up for you.\"\nLeonel could only bitterly smile as Malt led a group of three toward the Invalids.\nIt had already been two weeks since he came to the Slayer Legion, but this was about all he had done in that time. Other than the training he did in the Segmented Cube during his personal time, he was basically just a glorified compass.\n'Well… At least these guys treat me well.'\nThe big guy who just patted his bag went by the name Gerolt. He was part of a partnership program between the Scout Units and the Ground Combat Units. He was essentially in charge of their protection as they cleared out Invalids who got too close to the harbor.\nAside from him, the two others were an ordinary man and a young woman who looked like she was a teenager despite the fact she was apparently 30 years old. They went by Davy and Lisa respectively.\nThose two were among the 'trash' Captain Zhang mentioned. They didn't have scout related abilities but were rather combat oriented. Because their abilities were relatively weak, they were slotted into the scout units.\nOf course, things weren't exactly as simple as this. Before the Metamorphosis, many of the Slayer Legion's members were already present. As such, they had roles they were already very much used to. This was why even though Malt had awakened a sensory type ability, he still charged along with the others, leaving Leonel behind.\nLeonel sighed watching Gerolt pull a massive mace from his back and take the vanguard. A moment later, though, he caught himself.\n'Since when was it that I would rather take part in a battle than take a backseat?'\nLeonel's brow furrowed slightly. It was a fleeting thought he didn't have much of a chance to linger on because the battle was already over.\nGerolt beamed, laughing jovially. In the back, Malt caressed one of his guns in a silk cloth, caring for it as though it was his own child. He wasn't acting like a man who should have been their leader at all. At this point, even the stoic Davy and the quiet Lisa were smiling.\nTheir days had simply been too leisurely with Leonel around. Invalids never sneaked up on them anymore, they got great and detailed reports on them before even getting close, and they hadn't met any B-grade or above Invalids. He was practically their lucky star.\n\"Let's return. We'll be able to report some great gains this time. I think I'll finally be able to afford the extended clip.\" Malt's eyes glowed like a child on Christmas day.\n\"Rookie, you're too good. How do you feel about joining the Ground Combat Unit?\" Gerolt grinned.\n\"Are you trying to poach my talent? Don't even think about it.\" Malt growled.\nGerolt was even taller than Leonel, so there was no need to speak about just how much shorter Malt was than him. Yet, the latter didn't back down, even tapping the nozzle of his gun against Gerolt's chest.\n\"He's wasted here. Your Scout Unit is lacking.\" Gerolt didn't seem disturbed by Malt at all.\n\"And your Ground Dog Unit is any better? Tell me the last time you mutts were of any use?\"\nGerolt snorted. \"Everyone knows the ground is the core strength of an army.\"\n\"… W-we shouldn't fight.\" Lisa said softly.\nUnfortunately, her words were completely drowned out by the roars of the two men.\n\"The ground is the core of an army's strength? Do you think this is the 17th century? I can name tons of units more valuable than yours without much effort! The Air Combat Unit, the Navy Combat Unit, the Research and Technology Unit, the Space Combat Unit, the —\"\n\"You think I won't bounce my mace off that balding head of yours? Why don't you just shave it all off?\" Gerolt growled.\nEven if he looked a bit simple, he wouldn't just sit here and let Malt list all the units of the Slayer Legion. The fact he wanted to try was insulting enough.\n\"Oh, I'm so scared. Gerolt the Mace, the man who was so useless to even the shitty Ground Combat Unit wants to harm little old me. How are ground units useful in this day and age? If you tried to march to the Empire's capital, you'd get blown to smithereens before you took your second step!\"\nLeonel and Davy looked up at each other at the same time and shook their heads. With Lisa scurrying around like a little mouse, trying to stop the both of them, and Gerolt and Malt at each other's throats again, it seemed that only the two of them were even somewhat normal.\nSuddenly, Leonel looked off toward a particular direction. His brows furrowed slightly.\n'It's only an A-grade Invalid, but without knowing its ability, I can't guarantee that I can keep them safe. I had a feeling that things were going a bit too smoothly recently.'\nThe A-grade Invalid Leonel sensed was out of the range of his sharp Internal Sight and was within the foggy region. He could just vaguely tell its strength from this distance but nothing else. However, it was most definitely headed in this direction.\n'I doubt that it's locked onto us specifically… This direction also happens to be the direction of the harbor. This is a good opportunity.'\nAt first, Leonel felt that it was unfortunate that he was being underestimated as this would slow his plans. But, after some more thinking, he realized that this wasn't as bad as he thought.\nIf he was too powerful, the Slayer Legion would always put their best foot forward in his presence. It would be easier to judge a person's character by how they treated those weaker than them.\n'From what I've seen, the strongest amongst them only has a B-grade ability. An A-grade Invalid is definitely a huge threat to them, potentially catastrophic. I'll observe for a bit…'\nLeonel knew by now that this was just a small portion of the Slayer Legion. They were actually here to scour the wreckage of Royal Blue Province and harvest raw materials from the collapsed structures. One could imagine that the materials used to build a city of elites were invaluable.\nHowever, this was just the nice way to put it. They were basically just scavengers.\n'Let's see how they pass this test…'\nLeonel's expression returned to normal as though nothing had happened. Soon, they had returned to the harbor. It hadn't even been a minute upon their return when the warning signals began to blare.\n< \"Alert! Alert! A-grade Threat Detected!\" >",

      "content": "Gerolt and Malt, who had still been at each other's throats, froze on the spot.\n\"A-grade?\"\nThey mumbled these words together, the fear in their eyes evident. At the same time, they felt quite lucky that they had managed to return to the harbor.\nAt that moment, the six Captains rushed out from their ships while the seventh, Captain Zhang, left his tent. Each began barking out orders, but it became very obvious, very quickly, that there simply wasn't much time to prepare.\n\"Come on, we're under Captain Sela's charge.\" Malt finally began acting like a Squad Leader again.\nLeonel frowned. \"Not Captain Zhang?\"\n\"No. The Scouting Unit has always been separated between the ships not much unlike the Research and Technology Unit. Our squad is under Captain Sela.\"\nThough Malt said this and they even joined up with the burly captain's group, they were pretty much no different than background characters. Malt might have been disparaging the Ground Combat Unit earlier, but they were the ones who took charge this time around.\n\"Hoho, is that Bear Mace Gerolt I see? Come back to seek our protection?\"\nA man no smaller than Gerolt seemed to have locked onto their group as they passed by. Their movements were simply too conspicuous. After all, they were rushing from the front of the harbor to the backline since they had just returned. Many eyes had been on them from the beginning. But, realizing that they were just a scouting squad, many directly ignored them.\nGerolt cast this man a glance but said nothing else. It was quite a surprise for Leonel who had just watched this man argue with Malt for the last half month. He hadn't known that this large man had the ability to not respond.\nUnfortunately, the man who spoke didn't seem to take this very seriously as his hearty laughter only grew.\n\"Don't worry, Bear Mace. We'll take the front line for you. Wouldn't want another squad wipeout on our hands, it's best that you observe from a safe distance.\"\nGerolt's steps paused for a moment, his eyes narrowing. But once again, he said nothing.\nThe man's laughter was chorused by his squad around them, but no one else said anything. The moment was too tense. Honestly speaking, they took this as a reprieve from the looming danger. Even Captain Sela, who was present for the entire matter, didn't say anything.\nLeonel frowned.\n\"There's a battle that's going to be happening here soon. I think it's better you focus on that rather than getting some meaningless jabs in.\"\nFor Captain Sela's troop, hearing Leonel's voice was probably the last thing they expected at this point. Many eyes couldn't help but turn toward him. However, what they saw left them furrowing their eyebrows.\nHe was too young. He looked too fragile. No matter how they looked at it, he was just a rookie who was getting involved in something he shouldn't have. But, at the same time, they found it hard to directly refute his words.\n\"… Ha, I didn't know Bear Mace had fallen so low that he needed a kid to protect him now. Boy, you should stay away from this one. He's a blight wherever he goes. There's a reason we call him —\"\n\"I get it. Haha, very funny. Bear Mace is quite a clever nickname. Since you're clever enough to think of it, you should be clever enough to know when you should and shouldn't be saying certain things. You're a grown man, why are you acting like a petulant child?\"\n\"Leonel.\"\nThe sudden voice of interjection made Leonel frown. All this time, Captain Sela hadn't said a word, but she was suddenly speaking now?\nTo the man who was the target of Leonel's barrage of words, though, she was like his saving grace. If it wasn't for the possibility of him losing too much face, he would probably bow his head and thank her at this very moment.\nLeonel's gaze met hers but he didn't respond.\n\"That's enough.\" Captain Sela continued with furrowed brows.\nLeonel's expression didn't have much of a change, but he was inwardly disappointed.\n\"I see.\" He said plainly. \"Let's go, then.\"\nThe second part of his words were aimed toward his squad. There really wasn't much time left, they didn't have the luxury of lurking around here any longer. He had had a good impression of Captain Sela, but he didn't think that she'd be this kind of person.\nHe had an idea of why she had done it. To the coming battle, the ground units were too important and their mental states were even more important. Though the man's words were cruel, it also had the effect of alleviating the tension of the troops. But, after Leonel berated him, they had become high strung once more.\nIf Captain Sela didn't step out to protect the leader of her vanguard and show them that she was on their side, it would be difficult to calm them down again. Plus, wasn't it a small price to pay?\nThe man was known as Aitken was the leader of her strongest ground combat squad. As for Leonel, he was just a scout who had made a small name for himself in recent days. Who she would pick was obvious. If she could trade a tense relationship with Leonel for a stronger vanguard, why would she hesitate?\nLeonel was intelligent enough to understand this. He seemed like an immature kid, but he had been leading his peers all his life. He understood the importance of mental state.\nHowever, what he had never done was allow the disparagement of one of his own just for some cheap points. That was the sign of a terrible leader. If the upper echelon of the Slayer Legion was all like this, they were doomed from the very beginning.\n\"Hold on.\" Captain Sela's frown deepened. \"I heard from Squad Leader Zhang that —\"\n\"I don't know a Squad Leader Zhang.\" Leonel responded. \"Could it be that you're referring to Captain Zhang?\"\nCaptain Sela's expression grew dark.\n\"Kid, you should watch your mouth.\" Aitken growled.\n\"Did I say something wrong?\" Leonel put on a confused expression. If it wasn't for the fact he was clearly at odds with Captain Sela now, others would really believe that he had no idea what he was saying.\n\"… I've heard from Captain Zhang that your scouting ability is the best we have.\" Captain Sela stopped Aitken from speaking anymore. \"The greatest danger we face now isn't just the A-grade Invalid, but the other Invalids that might be attracted by the battle. I will need you to stay here with me to point out approaching dangers.\"\n\"Captain Sela…!\"\nGerolt finally couldn't take it anymore. Leonel had stepped out for him in the first place and he had already wanted to say something earlier. But now Captain Sela wanted Leonel, who was just a little scout, to stay with the vanguard? Wasn't that just forcing him to his death?\nLeonel's gaze narrowed as well.\n\"Are you disobeying a direct order from a Captain?\" Captain Sela didn't seem to hear Gerolt at all and only continued to look toward Leonel.\n\"No, where would a little scout like me get such guts? I'll be counting on Captain to protect me well.\" Leonel said with a smile.\n\"Ignorance is bliss.\" Aitken said with a sneer.\nCaptain Sela gave Leonel a profound look, but said no more.\n\"I won't stand for this!\"\nJust when they all thought it was over, Gerolt swung his mace out from his back and slammed it down, causing a loud boom that finally caught the attention of the other Captains and their squads.\n\"Gerolt.\" Leonel patted him on the shoulder. \"It's fine.\"\nOthers might think that Captain Sela was just targeting him, but Leonel could see through the logical flow of how things had gotten here. Maybe had he not corrected her about Captain Zhang's title, she wouldn't have reacted this way.\nBut, regardless, it didn't matter much to him.\nAn A-grade Invalid? He had killed seven even before forming a single Force Node. Plus, there wasn't any time left to argue about it.\n\"I'll be fine, Captain Sela will protect me. Get to the back quickly.\"\nIn the distance, the Invalid was already approaching. But, what Leonel saw made him frown slightly.\n'That's not an Invalid…'\nA gorilla-like creature which was two meters tall even when walking on its fists slowly approached.",

He had just assumed it was an Invalid previously. There was something about this creature that reminded him of one.\nHe had originally sensed the creature with the foggy range of his Internal Sight. Due to this, he had made an error in judgment.\n'Is this another beast like the octopus?'\nLeonel's frown deepened. As ridiculous as it was, the appearance of the octopus was still something he could accept. After all, the Royal Blue Province was located on the coast. It wasn't impossible for such a thing to happen even if the likelihood was low.\nHowever, a gorilla? They were too far away from their natural habitats. The chances of one appearing here should be even lower than an octopus having attacked him in the city.\n\"Did Captain Sela ask for you four?! Move to the back and don't ruin my formation!\" Aitken roared to Malt and the rest.\n\"You…\" Gerolt almost imploded once again.\n\"Soldier, get to the backline now.\" Captain Sela stared daggers at the scouting squad who seemed reluctant to leave Leonel's side.\nGerolt was brimming with anger. It seemed that he really might swing his mace any moment now. However, Captain Sela's next words were like a bucket of cold water being poured over his emotions.\n\"Are you trying to be court-martialed?\"\nCompared to the real army of the Empire, those of the Slayer Legion feared these words even more. They were already fugitives. If they were rejected from the rebels as well, just where would they go? What could they do with their lives? They'd basically be finished.\nIn a way, joining the rebel army was like giving the key to your life to another. There was no longer a way out.\nGerolt and the rest of Malt's squad became drenched in sweat. With pale faces, they could only cast guilty looks toward Leonel and slowly disappear toward the back of the formation.\n\"Form up!\" Captain Sela roared.\nAt this point, the gorilla was still leisurely strolling toward their direction as though it hadn't sensed their hostility at all. It looked toward the six units of the Slayer Legion as though observing fun toys. It didn't seem to take their formations seriously at all.\nEach of the six units was led by a Captain. The only one without a troop to lead of his own was Captain Zhang, but he stood beside another Captain who was a handsome man with eyes as black as his hair.\nThe number of warriors under each Captain didn't surpass 30 by much. But, this still meant that the gorilla was facing almost 200 alone.\nThe more it acted like this, the weirder Leonel felt it was. What was going on?\n\"Fire!\"\nThe roar came from a woman that went by Captain Gelen. She was considered an arms specialist amongst the seven captains. In fact, Malt had once been a part of her unit before he awakened his ability and was pushed to the scouting units.\nA rain of bullets came down toward the gorilla.\nIf it was any normal primate, their death would be sealed. However, at that moment, the carefree beast suddenly roared, standing on its hind legs and beating its chest.\nA silver glow instantly coated its massive body, forming just before the bullets reached it.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nThe bullets rebounded as though meeting a steel wall.\nSolemn expressions coated the faces of the rebels. Those were the strongest arsenal of weapons they had. Their group wasn't provided enough funds by the Legion to build Force disrupting towers. In fact, their mere existence was top secret, or else it wouldn't only be the inner city of the Fort that benefited.\nSince bullets were useless, their only option was to rely on the treasures they gained from entering Zones.\n\"Charge!\"\nThis time, it was Captain Sela who roared. Not giving the troops time to lose their morale, she ordered her vanguard to take the initiative.\nLeonel shook his head. 'This isn't going to work. Their organization is terrible. This creature is large, but still scales well to a normal human. Attacking it with so many when its defense is so sturdy is foolish. Captain Sela sending a small vanguard forward is the smartest decision, but… they're too weak.\"\nAitken took the head of the charge, a tall tower shield strapped to his left all and a trident piercing forward in his right.\nThe gorilla retaliated fiercely, another roar leaving its lips as it lashed out at the tower shield with two hammer fists.\nAitken lowered his stance, bending his knees and exploding forward with all his strength to meet the blow.\nA roar left his lips, but the subsequent sound left his ears ringing.\nAitken slid back against the ground, crashing into his squadmates and knocking them off their feet. Their forward momentum was completely thrown off and half of them lost the ability to attack in the blink of an eye.\nCaptain Sela's expression changed. It wasn't just her either. Even Leonel's own expression changed, albeit for different reasons.\nFirst, this gorilla was no normal A-grade threat. It was most definitely infinitely close to the S-grade. And second… The activation of that silver barrier had caught the attention of several Invalids.\n'That's impossible! The dictionary said that Invalids ignore threats from other species. What the hell is going on?'\nCaptain Sela and the other Captains grit their teeth to join, but Leonel stopped them.\n\"Captain Gelen! Captain Remon! There are three groups of Invalids coming from 2 O'Clock! The strongest of them is of the B-grade! Captain Patrice! Captain Sayer! Captain Girard! There are two groups of Invalids coming from 11 O'Clock! There are two B-grade Invalids with them!\"\nThe voice was one many of the Captains and rebels didn't recognize. But there was something about its confidence and fullness that made them believe the words.\nHowever, just when they were about to move according to his words, Captain Sela interrupted.\n\"Boy, know your place! You're sending off five squads to deal with B-grade threats and leaving just one for an A-grade threat? Are your words even trust worthy?! Charge!\"\nCaptain Sela led a support unit toward Aitken's squad that had nearly been completely wiped out. Her words seemed to snap the other Captains awake. Those who had seen Captain Sela's conflict with Leonel earlier even thought he had done this on purpose in order to push her toward her death.\nSeveral unsatisfied gazes landed on Leonel, leaving him shaking his head. But, before he could say anything else, Sela had stepped onto a chariot that shot out a chain toward him.\nLeonel blinked toward the incredulous scene. 'What the he —\"\nHe couldn't even finish the thought before his wrists were bound and Sela's chariot shot forward, leaving him running with all his might to keep up lest he be dragged along the ground.\nRage swelled up in Leonel's chest.\nHe had sent five squads away because he was confident in handling this A-grade threat on his own. Let alone using someone else's hand to kill Sela, he could do it himself with absolute ease. But now he was being accused in this way? And chained to a chariot like some sort of prisoner, no less?\nEven a man with ten times the kind disposition Leonel had would feel endless fury at this point.",

      "content": "[I'm changing the bonus chapter requirement to every 500 powerstones. In return, I promise not to change it for another month. You can only blame yourselves for being too? powerful <3]\nLeonel was furious. He had never expected for such a thing to happen.\nNo matter how much stronger he was than Captain Sela, he wasn't at the point where he could break chains with nothing but his brawn. Even the alloys of the 25th century were beyond his means, let alone the fact that this chariot was a C-grade treasure she must have gained as a Zone reward.\n'I was careless…' Leonel's gaze blazed with a cold light as he was forced to continue running.\nHe never thought that Captain Sela would be so brazen. She probably thought that he was trying to get her killed, which was why she had reacted like this, but at this point, Leonel didn't care. The incompetence of the Slayer Legion was turning him off from them more and more.\nAitken slammed his tower shield in the ground, trying to get a stronger foothold against the gorilla.\nBy now, there were only three that could remain standing in his squad, including himself. He could tell that support would be coming soon, so he was only doing his best to hold the creature back. Though he was a dick, it seemed that he wasn't a coward who left his squadmates behind.\nUnfortunately, he wasn't very powerful. He seemed to have an ability that boosted the density of his muscles, but his strength was hardly over 0.80.\nIt was at that moment that Captain Sela came rushing in.\n\"Damned beast!\"\nAnother chain came rushing out of her chariot, trying to lock the beast down.\n'Idiot!' Leonel roared in his mind. Unfortunately, the next scene was bound to play out exactly as he had expected.\nThe chain snaked forward, wrapping around the gorilla's thick forearm just before it could launch another attack toward the squad.\nAitken looked up, pleasantly surprised. In fact, when he saw the sorry state Leonel was in, having to rush after the chariot with his hands bound like that, there was even deep satisfaction in his eyes.\nThough he had been a distance away, Leonel's roar of commands had covered the entire battlefield. How could he not be enraged after Captain Sela exposed his intentions. In fact, by now, many thought that Leonel had a voice compelling ability and had long since put up their guard against him.\nSeeing that the gorilla was tied down, Captain Sela's eyes brightened.\nShe raised a sharp broad sword with a two meter long blade from her back, hacking down with all the might she could muster.\nBut, she had forgotten one key detail. Tying someone down necessitated that you had a strong enough anchor. The best way to use this chariot's ability was to make use of its high maneuverability. The chain was meant to be a hidden card pulled out at an opportune time, not something to open a battle with.\nSela had managed to catch Leonel off guard and had the forward momentum of the chariot to help her keep control of him.\nHowever, the chariot was going toward the gorilla, not away from it. And now she had shot out a chain and wrapped its forearm. She had even grown confident enough to send a direct attack. But…\nJust when the Captains and soldiers were feeling excited, the gorilla slammed its free arm into the ground, roaring with all its might and swinging its bound arm upward.\n'Goddammit…'\nThe chariot lost its footing, soaring into the air and taking Sela and Leonel along with it.\nLeonel followed the arc of the chariot helplessly, both of his wrists bound together.\nBANG!\nThe chariot crashed and skid across the ground, its bronze light dimming somewhat.\nThe gorilla rose to its legs, its fists beating wildly against its chest. The sound was deafening. It felt as though a sound wave was tearing their eardrums apart.\nLeonel grunted, landing on the ground heavily. He rolled further and further completely out of his control.\nThough his chain necklace had taken the direct strikes for him, his inner organs still stirred upon impact. And, as though that wasn't enough, the chariot he was tied to was now rolling toward him.\nLeonel rolled to his back, facing his two feet toward the coming chariot in hopes of stopping it with his legs. Unfortunately, reality was cruel to him.\nA ledge of the chariot got caught in the ground, causing its skid along the ground to stop in favor of it popping into the air and crashing down toward him from above.\nLeonel grimaced.\nWithout a choice, a green light lit on the sole of his treasure shoes. He slammed down hard, sending him skidding along the ground faster and just out of the range of the chariot.\nFinally, the bronze chariot slowly came to a stop, but Leonel's expression was as dark as it could be. His fury was near reaching a tipping point.\nLeonel pulled at the chains on his wrist, but they still wouldn't budge. It might not have been that bad if his hands were bound individually, but with them stuck together like this, he couldn't even use a spear. And, it was obvious bullets wouldn't work on this beast.\nHe cast a glance toward Captain Sela who had landed in the distance. The chariot had been going at 50 kilometers an hour at least and it was obvious she didn't have a defensive treasure as good as his own. She could only rely on that thick skin and that armor she wore.\nAs expected, she was covered in blood and gravel. Leonel guessed that if it wasn't due to her awakening as an Evolver, she would have already died.\nAt this moment, the other units were still charging, having lagged behind Captain Sela's chariot. They had seen everything happen and couldn't help but look toward the gorilla in horror. However, for some reason, the gorilla only seemed to have eyes for Leonel now.\nLeonel's expression turned awful. 'Could it be this thing sensed me use Force just now?'\nThe situation was as bad as it could get. His hands were bound, there was a chariot weighing hundreds of pounds chained to him, and now this thing had locked onto him. And, as though that wasn't enough…\n\"Invalids! Invalids are coming!\" Captain Zhang roared.\nJust as Leonel had told them before. One group at 2 O'Clock and another at 11 O'Clock. Three B-grade Invalids between them. And now they were all here.\nIt was at that moment that the gorilla leapt across several meters, casting a vast shadow over Leonel as it raised its two fists into the air.\nLeonel ground his teeth. He had already decided. This damned Slayer Legion would have nothing to do with him after today.\n**\nIn the distance, there was a large ship slowly swaying off the harbor. Leonel had seen it the first time he stepped onto the harbor, but he had never considered why it was that it was there and why it seemed that no one from within it had done anything despite the looming threats.\nWithin this massive 200 meters long wooden ship, two men stood on the deck, watching the scene unfold.\n\"Are we really not going to help?\" One of them asked.\n\"This group is too incompetent. If they're not forged in fire, if they don't lose their lives today, they'll lose it at a later date. There wasn't much of a chance before the Metamorphosis for our lower level soldiers to get real fighting experience, but now we can slowly temper them…\"",

The gorilla directly ignoring them and jumping after the boy they saw as nothing other than a scout who overestimated himself and infuriated Captain Sela was completely out of their expectations.\n\"Rookie!\"\nGerolt and Malt's shrill cries reached Leonel, but they were simply too far away to do anything to help. Leonel was on his own.\nAt that very moment, Aitken and his injured squad members were taking advantage of the gorilla being distracted to retreat as quickly as they could. It became obvious that they had no intention of stepping into those muddied waters again. Even Captain Sela's life and death was unknown at this point, why would they risk themselves for a boy who was just being so arrogant mere moments ago.\nTo the units of the six Captains, Leonel was essentially finished. Still, the only ones who felt even the slightest shred of remorse was Captain Zhang who brought Leonel into his unit and the four squad members he had spent the last two weeks with.\nStill, none of them could do anything even if they wanted to.\nHowever, Leonel, the person in question, watched on with a cold expression.\nTiming his escape perfectly, he darted forward, leaping just out of the range of the gorilla's descending hammer fists. He pulled on his chains hard, taking advantage of the heavy chariot and his own strength to sweep the chain across the gorilla's ankles and knocking it off its feet.\nLeonel jumped toward the gorilla's back as it fell, wrapping the chain that bound his wrists across its neck. He pressed his knees down on either side of the beast's spine, pulling his arms back hard.\nThe veins of his arms bulged and the pain of the chains pressing against his wrists was excruciating. But Leonel continued to pull, wanting to break the gorilla's neck in one move.\n\"ROOOOOAAARRRRR!!!!\"\nThe gorilla bellowed, trying to lash out toward Leonel's hands.\nBut, Leonel shifted once more. His legs moved, sliding his knees from the gorilla's back and placing the soles of his feet flush against the beast's triceps.\nHe stamped down hard, pulling up with his arms as though he was trying to stand up, but the chains across the gorilla's neck were stopping him from doing so.\nIt seemed that the gorilla was finished. The control Leonel had over its neck was commanding. If it wasn't for its sturdy body, it would have already lost its head. But, the beast hadn't given up.\nWith another roar that made Leonel's ears ring, a familiar silver light coated the beast's body. In that moment, the soft flesh of the gorilla's neck became harder than steel. Leonel knew immediately that it had become impossible to break its neck anymore.\n'There must be a short duration for this ability, or else it wouldn't be turning it on and off like this. We'll see how long you can last!'\nUnfortunately, the gorilla didn't give Leonel the time. The moment it got the slightest bit of reprieve, it rolled to its back, trying to crush Leonel with his heavy weight.\nWithout a choice, Leonel could only leap away. A normal gorilla wasn't even 400 pounds, so Leonel was confident in outlasting the beast. However… He knew quite well that this wasn't a normal gorilla.\nAfter being freed, the gorilla felt a deep sense of humiliation that fueled its rage. In those moments, it had felt the call of death. It had really almost died at the hands of a puny human boy.\nIt rose up, lashing out with its fists toward Leonel, but the cold glint it found on the latter's face left it shivering.\nLeonel yanked the chain around his wrists again. In all its rage, the gorilla failed to realize that when it had rolled to get Leonel off its back like that, it had inadvertently wrapped the chain around itself loosely. This time when Leonel pulled, it was no longer as simple as tripping it. This time, its legs were tightly bound together, causing it to fall over once more.\nLeonel took hold of the opportunity, dashing to the side and picking up the two meter long broadsword Captain Sela had lost control of when the chariot went flying. It was impossible for him to use a spear properly, but it was easier to use a two-handed weapon with his hands bound like this.\nBy the time he brandished it, the gorilla had stood once more. Its eyes focused on Leonel with a crimson red, its snarls throwing hot air and flying spittle from its sharp canines. Its teeth glistened beneath the high sun almost like the tusks of a wild boar.\nTheir gazes clashed in the air before they dashed forward in unison.\nLeonel didn't know how to use a sword. But, he hadn't known how to use an ax back then either. However, what he did know were two things.\nFirst, the gorilla's attack pattern was too simple. And, secondly, its shield ability couldn't be abused. Better yet, this shield ability had just been used.\nLeonel's figure was nimble. The faint shadow of the succubus spearwoman could be seen in his movements.\nHe flitted around like a ghost, ducking out of the range of the gorilla's fist.\nAppearing to its side, his broad sword flashed forward, leaving afterimages in the air as it aimed for the gorilla's arm.\nCLANG!\nIt chipped and rebounded off of the silver light, but Leonel's movements didn't pause. He madly circled the gorilla, dodging and striking whenever he got the chance.\nThe haggard breaths and enraged roars of the gorilla rang over the battlefield.\nSuddenly, the silver energy shield flickered and Leonel's cold, calculating gaze blazed to life as he stepped forward like lightning.\nThe broad sword pierced forward completely unlike a sword. Despite the weapon in his hands being as clear as day, for just a moment, to those observing, it felt that it wasn't a sword in his hands at all… but rather, a spear.\nPCHUUU\nThe sword shot through the gorilla's neck. It had such a wide blade that the gorilla's collarbone and forehead were pierced in unison.\nThud.\nWith a dull sound, the gorilla fell, leaving Leonel standing over it expressionlessly.\nHis unkempt dirty blond hair was kicked up by the wind caused due to the beast's fall, waving about like a flowing river. His breathing was steady and unhurried. It was almost impossible to tell he had just been through a battle if not for the dead gorilla lying before him.\nThe battlefield was so silent the drop of a pin could be heard. They had all watched it from start to finish, but even having witnessed it themselves, they couldn't believe it. Even Aitken felt his knees trembling. Just what had he provoked?\nHowever, it was then that something unexpected occurred.\nThe gorilla began to shrink. Soon, there was nothing left but a naked man who died with his eyes wide open.",

      "content": "'A man…?' Leonel's pupils constricted.\nHe finally understood. The Invalids had been drawn here by this man's silver shield ability. Back then, Leonel had been confused, wondering why it was that they had been when the dictionary had told him earlier that Invalids wouldn't antagonize creatures from another race.\n'Is it that man from the Brazinger family again?'\nLeonel frowned, spreading his Internal Sight to the max. If Simeon was here, it would be a good opportunity to deal with him.\nAccording to the dictionary, Simeon had some sort of gene manipulation ability that fell into the SS-grade. There was a chance that this man was another one of his experiments…\nOf course, it was also possible that this gorilla form was just this man's ability. After all, Leonel used his own ability all the time but never attracted Invalids unless he used Force. If he thought about it, it also made sense if this man's transformation was his ability while the silver light was some sort of Force technique.\n'Am I overthinking it…? Is he not involved?'\nLeonel raised his head and swept a glance over the Slayer Legion units. Just the simple act made them feel as though their chests would burst from the thumping of their hearts.\nAt that moment, the Invalids led by B-grade threats had entered the range of the battlefield. Leonel had finished off the gorilla so quickly that there wasn't even an opportunity for them to influence the battle. However, Leonel didn't even cast them a glance. Was it even his problem anymore?\nIf they couldn't handle three B-grade Invalids on their own, could they even count themselves as a rebel army? Plus, Leonel wasn't a pushover even if he had a kind heart. After seeing Captain Sela's ridiculous actions, none of them stepped forward to say something, let alone help him.\n'I guess I was expecting too much from them. What could an organization that's done nothing but lose to the Empire for decades possibly have to offer. It's better if I just hone my Force Crafting and clear Zones as well. It won't take me more than a year to have enough trump cards to deal with the Junior Governor Duke and that man from the Brazinger Clan. Then I can go and find Aina…'\nHaving already made up his mind, Leonel ignored the cries of the rebel units and walked to the chariot that had bound him. Soon, he looked through the mechanisms and found what he needed to release the chains from his hands.\nLeonel sighed, rubbing his bruised wrists. 'I was too reckless this time. If I had been prepared for anything, I wouldn't have gotten caught like that.'\nIn the end, he was too inexperienced and had grown too confident. It was fine to be confident, but it had to come from a place of knowledge and strength. Leonel had the strength, but he was still lacking in knowledge.\nIn this world, there were too many unique abilities and treasures he had to account for, getting caught off guard would happen frequently. The only way to perfectly combat this would be to be cautious. If he had been, there was no way a mere Captain Sela could put him in such a situation.\nLeonel looked around again to find the rebel units fighting for their lives against the B-grade Invalids. Sometimes, pleading gazes would meet his own, making him feel guilty. In the end, he was still a bit soft and couldn't completely harden his heart. Ultimately, these people had been misled by Captain Sela. He didn't want to leave them hanging.\n'Fine, fine. Whatever.'\nLeonel took out his atlatl and three darts from his spatial bracelet. Killing B-grade threats was as easy as breathing for him. Three Invalids, three darts, three throws and three deaths. It was that simple.\nAs for the C-grade and lower Invalids, this time, he really did leave it to them.\nAt that moment, the weakened Captain Sela struggled to stand. Her left arm was bent at an unhealthy angle and a side of her face seemed to have skidded along the ground and was thus ruined by severe cuts, burns and blood, but she stood nonetheless.\nShe had no idea what had just happened and couldn't even see the gorilla any longer. All she saw was Leonel standing on her chariot.\nIn truth, Leonel was planning on leaving now. He just could have never imagined that instead of treating her injuries properly, this Captain Sela would actually come to find trouble with him in her half-dead state.\n\"Get away from my chariot!\" She snarled.\nLeonel cast a glance at her and shrugged, leaping off the chariot and turning to leave. However, completely out of Captain Sela' expectations, his destination wasn't the harbor where it was far safer, but rather back into the ruined city. It was obvious that he was intending to leave.\n\"You… Where do you think you're going?\"\nLeonel didn't have any intention of answering, so he just kept walking. Why would he even bother to stay here? This Slayer Legion was nothing but a joke. Their Captains were fools, their fighting strength was weak, and as if this wasn't enough, they apparently didn't have issues targeting their own men.\nAn organization rotting from the inside-out like this didn't deserve his effort. It seemed that Earth really had nothing left for him.\nIt was a thought he never thought he would have, but now it was as firm as a lighthouse in a dark, foggy night.\n'They might still have some use.' Leonel thought. 'In the small likelihood that that man was one of his experiments and he finds out it was taken out in this harbor… he might send more to investigate. In that case, I can find out a bit more about this Brazinger family.'\nLeonel's gaze grew frosty. If it wasn't for them, he would have never been separated from Aina.\n\"… Do you think that the Slayer Legion is a joke?! You think it's possible to join one day and leave the next?! Why aren't you all doing anything?!\"\nHearing this question, many looked at Captain Sela with weird gazes. He just took down an A-grade threat with his hands bound. Then he took down three B-grade Invalids with three flicks of his wrist. Do something about it? Wasn't that the real joke?\nLeonel's footsteps paused.\nOf course, it had absolutely nothing to do with Captain Sela. She could scream ten times harder and he still wouldn't listen to her ramblings. The reason he stopped was because a man had suddenly appeared before him. And, though he didn't know it, this was the very same man who had been observing the battle from the large ship in the distance.\nThough Leonel didn't know this, he had seen how this man got here with his Internal Sight. He rode the waves of the water with his bare feet then launched himself here… Yet, the process was so quiet that no one but Leonel seemed to notice his actions at all.\n\"It seems I will have to reward you with a promotion, Captain Sela. When you sent a report that a recruit came in with a stolen invitation card, I hadn't thought much of it. But it seems that your intuition was right. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would have never thought that this kid was a spy.\n\"I should have known… A critical margin of error wouldn't appear without reason.\"",

      "content": "Leonel cocked an eyebrow. There was something weird about this situation. It was missing the edge it should have, or maybe it was something else he couldn't quite put his finger on.\nHowever, Leonel had already suffered once today from not being cautious enough. He had no intention of making the same mistake twice. Instead, he silently observed, his senses primed to their peak. He seemed to be relaxed, but there wasn't a single detail within 200 meters of him that he missed.\nCaptain Sela's eyes flashed with happiness when she heard the man's words. As a Captain, of course she knew who this man was.\n\"Make things a bit easier on yourself, young man. Don't resist and come with me.\"\n\"… It's no wonder you all have never stood a chance against the Empire.\"\nEven in the 25th century, there were certain offensive things one should never say. Racial slurs, culturally insensitive phrases, ignorant and uninformed statements… However, even among all of these things, maybe saying such a thing amongst a field of rebels was amongst the worst.\nAt that point, even the carefree man who had just rode a wave to block Leonel's path had a stiff expression. If Leonel could read the man's mind, he might have felt a little bad.\nThe truth was that this man hadn't come here to make trouble for Leonel. He had said those things, but that was only to keep up a certain facade. He had good reasons for treating Leonel the way he did and if the boy just cooperated a little bit, he would know the reasons why in just a few moments.\nBut this boy just had to go and say these things. Why was he so brazen? Doesn't he know that he's surrounded by 200 people? Even if he took down the gorilla, he would die meeting such a large group as long as there was one person near his battle strength. As far as the man was concerned, Leonel could at best match him. In that case, getting into a fight with their group would only lead to his death.\n'… Ah, dammit, kid. How am I supposed to continue now? If I don't respond with anger, those with eyes here will get suspicious. But, if I do fight you, how can we end this peacefully? Dammit, dammit.'\nAt this point, the man realized he had acted a bit too rashly. He should have approached with a better plan, but this was the best he could do in such a short time.\nIf he waited any longer, Leonel would have left. After Leonel left, there was no guarantee that he wouldn't be secretly watched by others. In this case, it would be even more suspicious if he tried to meet him in secret.\nEven if by some miracle he managed to successfully meet Leonel after he left without alerting anyone else, there was no guarantee that he would be able to sneak Leonel back like he wanted to.\nThis should have been the perfect opportunity. He should have been able to 'arrest' Leonel while showing favoritism he shouldn't have. Then, he would have been able to 'imprison' him and thus gain a perfect excuse for why Leonel was with them.\nIn this way, those keeping an eye on the rebels would underestimate them more, thinking that their leaders were trash for getting rid of a talent like Leonel for short term benefits. And, at the same time, they would be able to secretly bring Leonel to their side and gain yet another hidden trump card.\nEverything was so perfect, but this boy was displaying too much confidence which left the man uneasy. Suddenly, something that should have been a simple task became incredibly difficult and there was no longer a path for him to take it easy on Leonel.\n'Damned hot blooded kids and their damned pride, fuck.'\nWith no other choice, the man's face twisted into a feigned rage.\n\"Kid, you sure have a big mouth.\" He growled. \"Remember this well, I am Lieutenant Damian Warner. Today, I'll teach you a lesson on behalf of your parents!\"\nLeonel's expression darkened.\nHe couldn't read the man's mind. Even if he found this situation weird, he tossed all thoughts of finding out what was wrong after hearing such words. His dad had disappeared to who knows where, but that didn't give this man the right to comment on it.\nLeonel's aura grew heavy, the silver pole of his bike appearing in his hands.\nDamian realized that there was something wrong with the atmosphere almost immediately, but by the time he realized he might have said something wrong, the blunt tip of Leonel's rod was already before him.\n'Shit, shit, shit!'\nThis speed, this technique, this strength. Each and every one was far beyond Damian's expectations. He felt as though a whole world was bearing down on him and that no matter what he did, he wouldn't be able to dodge.\nThe shadow of a spear was projected into his mind. He couldn't help but think… 'If this was a spear, wouldn't I be dead now?'\nDamian quickly crossed his arms, taking the brunt of Leonel's strike with his forearms.\nBANG!\nWithout suspense, he was sent flying. It wasn't until he had moved back almost ten meters that the ground beneath him suddenly 'awakened', stretching up into the skies like a wave and catching him like a soft pillow.\nLeonel's eyes narrowed. 'It seems his ability isn't as simple as water control. This is an S-grade power at worst, and I still feel like I'm underestimating it.'\nLeonel was using his rod instead of his spear because he wanted to separate himself from the influence of his Spear Domain Lineage. He felt that his comprehension of his Lineage Factor was too weak and that the only way to find out exactly what made it tick was by comparing his abilities with it and without it. In addition, he felt that he didn't need his Lineage Factor to defeat this man.\nHowever, this ability put quite a bit of pressure on him. He had only seen a small glimpse of it, but he saw endless possibilities. If this man was even somewhat competent, he too should be able to handle A-grade threats just as easily as Leonel did.\nWhat Leonel didn't know was that the man's expression was growing gloomier and gloomier. Having sensed Leonel's strength, he realized that taking him in like this would be even more difficult. As if things weren't bad enough… His arms were broken.\n'This little devil. No wonder he embarrassed Royal Blue Fort and the Leum family like that. Who created this little monster?'\nDamian's arms hung limply to his side, wanting to shed real tears when he saw Leonel charging toward him again.",

      "content": "Leonel's speed was beyond the limits of a mortal. However, with his experience in martial arts, Damian realized that it wasn't as simple as pure pace. There was something odd about the rhythm of Leonel's steps that made him seem even faster than he was, as though he was approaching from all sorts of impossible angles at once.\n'How is this possible? I've immersed myself in martial arts for decades, why can't I match up against a little boy?!'\nDamian roared in his mind, but he realized that he couldn't allow this to continue in this fashion and for so long at that. However, what he didn't know was that Leonel was disappointed by his performance.\n'I'm still missing something, she was far better than this.'\nHowever, as soon as this calculative thought appeared in Leonel's mind, it was thrown out. This wasn't because it was wrong, but rather because he was pissed.\nFirst this Slayer Legion was incompetent to the point they rated his ability within the D-grade. Then he was targeted by one of their Captains without reason. To make matters worse, that captain had actually tried to kill him.\nAll of this was already enough to push someone to the edge.? But, as though they wanted to make sure he was aware of just how worthless this organization was, this prick had appeared and actually mentioned something about teaching him a lesson in place of his father?\nIn what felt like the blink of an eye Leonel had appeared before Damian, his body sinking into a low crouch that concentrated all the torque of his hips toward the ground and rebounded it back up toward his piercing rod.\nIt was a beautiful synchronization of the primitive man's body control and the primitive woman's speed.\nDamian fell back, a fluid pillar of earth appearing before him and Leonel.\nAs though expecting this, Leonel's steps shifted. His body flitted across the air, leaving shadows in the wake as his slid to Damian's side, only to find another wall of earth waiting for him.\n'These walls aren't solid. In order to move them, he's sacrificing the sturdiness of the earth. But since he can't manipulate material without negatively influencing its rigidity, how is it that he could ride a wave like that?'\nLeonel didn't dare to come in contact with Damian's wall of Earth, he could only continuously avoid it. Who knew if this was Damian's ploy? If he entered the seemingly fluid earth and Damian solidified it, it would be too late to regret it.\nEven as Leonel felt that he was getting a headache trying to deal with Damian's ability, Damian himself was in an even sorrier state.\nHis arms weren't broken to the point of suffering a clean snap, but there were most definitely several fractures. Regardless, his arms were as good as useless.\nNow, with his arms in this state, he couldn't use weapons. And, even if he could, he didn't want to draw a gun on Leonel lest he accidentally kill the kid. How could he know that Leonel didn't have to worry about bullets due to his Quasi Bronze chain necklace?\nLeonel frowned, retreating explosively only to find a wall of fluid earth blocking his path backward.\n'Not good.'\nCompletely out of expectations, instead of continuing to retreat, Leonel firmly planted and shot forward with everything he had. At this point, even Damian was caught off guard. He had thought that Leonel would continue to run, trying to escape the range of his abilities.\nHowever, while Damian was trying to end this peacefully, Leonel still believed this was a battle he might lose his life in. In such a case, he wouldn't take a chance on guessing where Damian's range ended.\nIf the range was within ten meters, Leonel might be able to escape. But, if it was ten times that, Leonel would be trapped and then his life would be in the hands of another.\nHowever, if he was as close to Damian as possible, he wouldn't trap himself, right? There was no guarantee the Damian didn't have another way to escape, but between the two options, Leonel's calculative mind quickly deduced that this had the least risk.\nDamian's eyes flashed. At that moment, the land Leonel was running on suddenly began to sink.\nBut, as though having already thought of this possibility, Leonel's expression didn't even change.\nWith a thought, his soles glowed green once more as he stamped down hard, sending him flashing to the side once more.\nDamian's eyes widened in surprise, not catching why it was that Leonel seemed unaffected by the swamp-like ground. Leonel hadn't jumped high into the air before using his treasure shoes this time, so their effect was extremely low profile this time around.\nStill, Damian was experienced in combat and reacted quickly, erecting another wall of fluid earth after judging Leonel's landing location. But, he suddenly felt uncomfortable when he saw Leonel's lip curl.\nLeonel, who had just been in the air, shouldn't have been able to change his direction at all. By all rights, it should have been impossible. But, in that moment, another green light flashed from Leonel's other shoe and he suddenly took a sharp turn that seemingly defied the laws of physics.\nDamian hardly registered what had happened when Leonel had shot through a gap in his walls of earth.\nHe panicked, trying to quickly close them down into a cage. But, it was too late.\nLeonel's foot slammed into his chest, pushing him to the ground. Damian's vision spun and by the time he could see again, he felt a cold rod pressing against his throat.\nFrom the outside, all the rebels saw was a half-sphere of fluid earth. Leonel and Damian were completely blocked from their view, but they still were left stunned.\nThis sort of battle, had it really been between two humans? Even if it wasn't as exaggerated as the earth splitting and sky shattering, it was still enough to leave them in awe. Captain Sela especially felt as though a lump had been firmly lodged in her throat.\nThis sort of battle prowess… D-grade? Which bullshit engineer built the machine that said his ability was D-grade?!\n\"Wait! Wait! Wait!\"\nWhat the rebels could have never expected was that the Lieutenant Damian they all respected so much had put his hands up in surrender. Leonel had his silver rod on his throat and a foot on his chest, was it really possible for him to do anything else but this?\nLeonel frowned. The smartest thing to do would be to apply pressure and break through Damian's throat now, but he hesitated hearing his words.\nDamian sighed in relief seeing that Leonel didn't act to kill him immediately.\n\"I know you're angry with me, but I had to do things this way so that you could join without attracting the eyes of others.\"\nThe lieutenant obviously didn't want to play with his life anymore so he immediately got to the point.\nLeonel frowned. Could it be that the Slayer Legion wasn't as useless as he thought? However, he had no intention of releasing Damian so easily. His ability was too powerful. If he was a bit more experienced with it, Leonel would have been finished. This encounter truly taught Leonel the terror of abilities.\n\"Keep speaking. I won't release you until I hear something worthwhile. You better be quick as well. If we stay here for too long, your plan will fail even if you convince me.\"",

      "content": "Damian bitterly smiled. Of course he understood what Leonel meant. If they remained in here for too long, no matter how convincing their previous act was, it would become suspicious. In that case, it wouldn't matter if he convinced Leonel to play along.\n\"There's not much I can tell you.\" Damian said through gritted teeth. \"But I think you're smart enough to know why this is the approach we must take. The more competent we seem, the more attention the Empire will pay to us and the less chance we'll have in the long run.\"\nLeonel had already thought as much, but this wasn't enough to convince him of anything.\n\"Do you think that the Empire is stupid? I doubt they're unaware that this is a facade.\"\n\"It doesn't matter if they know, they'll still underestimate us. A vague threat will always be taken less seriously than a tangible one. As long as they don't know the true extent of our depths, it'll be easier for them to neglect us.\"\nDamian was trying to speak quicker and quicker, not wanting to give up this chance. If they could take in Leonel secretly, this would be great.\n\"I assume by your words that you know who I am? Unless you were really crazy enough to try this stunt after seeing the small bit I showed?\"\nDamian's lip twitched. 'Small bit'? How much more was there? He was already in this state!\n\"Yes, I know that you're Leonel Morales and know that you're a Variant. In addition, I also know of what happened at the Fort.\"\n\"Good, that makes things easier. I'll agree to join and help your Slayer Legion as long as you support me to take down Royal Blue Fort within half a year and you help me take this damned wrist watch off. If you say yes, I'll let you take me out of here as your 'prisoner'.\"\nDamian's expression changed.\nThis matter was simply too big. It wasn't that they didn't want to take down the Fort. In fact, if they were willing to pay a small price, it wasn't impossible to take the Fort down even without Leonel's help. The issue was that it wasn't worth it.\nThe Slayer Legion still wasn't ready to appear boldly in the real world just yet, so what good was the Fort to them? It would do nothing but make them an immobile and vulnerable target.\nIn addition, the Governor Duke, the true powerhouse of the Royal Blue Province, wasn't here. So, at best you'd be taking down his son who hadn't even really grown into a man yet. This was another reason why it wasn't worth it.\n\"I know what you're thinking.\" Leonel said expressionlessly. \"But, is it really as you're thinking? You're on this expedition right now to scavenge the broken pieces of fallen buildings… Wouldn't it be much better to directly snatch the technology of the Royal Blue Fort?\"\nDamian's eyes suddenly shone bright at these words. If it was looked at from this angle… it was indeed possible.\nThe truth was that he had quite a bit of freedom when it came to what exactly to do with this group. Their value wasn't very high to the Slayer Legion and they were essentially here just to train and hopefully become useful in the future. If he wanted to attack the Fort, he could make the decision alone…\nTaking a deep breath, Damian's eyes sharpened with resolution.\n\"I can't make the decision to remove your Shackle, but I can agree to attack the Fort with you after some more preparation. But, since you're such a high profile recruit, it will be necessary for you to gain a more… thorough clearance.\"\nLeonel paused for a while, looking at Damian quite intently. It was to the point the latter couldn't help but squirm.\n\"Alright. I hope you keep your word.\"\nDamian sighed a breath of relief when Leonel finally removed his rod and foot from his body.\nOn the outside, the rebels were quite anxious. They had no idea that such a conversation was happening. Everyone one of them believed that an intense battle was taking place within that cage of earth.\nWhen the fluid earth finally began to crumble, they all held their breaths before bursting into a chorus of cheers.\nDamian stood at the front, proudly walking with Leonel's rod in one hand and a rope formed of fluid earth in his other. Attached to the end of this rope were Leonel's bound hands. He stalked forward slowly like the prisoner he was.\nNo, actually, upon closer inspection, his feet were bound as well. He was only moving because their lieutenant was sliding him across the ground with his ability. How magical.\nThat was their lieutenant! He was so powerful!\nCaptain Sela felt as though a weight had been lifted from her chest and she couldn't help but smirk. Though, since half her face was covered in bloody, burnt and peeling skin, she looked even more unattractive than she usually did.\nDamian smiled brightly. \"Captain Sela, for your role in this you'll definitely be rewarded well. It might not be impossible for you to become a Colonel.\"\nCaptain Sela felt giddy with excitement. She put on an expression that might have been adorable on a 5 year old girl but looked simply ridiculous on her before she sent a sneer Leonel's way.\nLeonel, however, had his head down, his eyes aimed toward the ground. Beneath his drooping hair, his calm, calculating gaze was hidden.\nIn the distance, Gerolt, Malt, Lisa and Davy clenched their fists tightly. They didn't know what all this spy talk was about, but they did know that Leonel had saved them all not just once, but twice. First with the A-grade threat and then by taking out the three B-grade Invalids.\nEven beyond this, his ability had saved them who knows how many times during their rounds. It was just that he was so good they never ran into trouble so even they didn't have an exact number…\nHowever, they were too weak. There was nothing they could do to help him.\nIn the end, they had known Leonel for too little time. They were unable to bring themselves to risk everything for his sake. And, even if they did try to… What exactly could they accomplish?\nOf course, the person in question, Leonel himself, wasn't bothered by such things. He was an understanding person for the most part, so he wouldn't hold grudges for something like this. It was only as simple as that their friendship would likely never deepen beyond this surface level.\nThat said, Leonel wasn't even actively thinking about such things. He wasn't even aware of their complicated feelings.\nAt this moment, his Internal Sight was completely focused on the corpse of the man, turned gorilla, turned back to man. He wanted to check on as many clues as he could at the 'crime scene' before things were moved around.\nSomething still felt fishy about the whole thing.",

      "content": "A long while later, Leonel had been escorted by Damian to the large ship in the distance. There, there was surprisingly another man waiting. What was surprising wasn't the fact that there was such a man, but rather that he was quite literally the only other member on board.\nThat was right, a ship of 200 meters in length, rivaling any luxury yacht, was accommodating just two men… How did this work, exactly?\n'It can't be that Lieutenant Damian can use his ability to move such a large ship… right?'\nLeonel felt his heart skip a beat. If this was true, it likely meant that it was easier for Damian to control water as opposed to earth. In that case, if the latter had any evil thoughts, even Leonel wouldn't be able to do much about it.\nHowever, even after thinking to this point, Leonel remained calm. The reason was precisely his previous run-in with the octopus. He couldn't imagine what kind of powerful creatures were lying in wait in the depths of the ocean right now. Even in the 25th century, Earth still didn't know everything about its waters.\nWith the threat of him releasing his Force, Damian wouldn't likely dare to act rashly. Plus, Leonel believed that the lieutenant was being sincere. Leonel believed himself to be quite good at reading people, even his own best friend of over a decade couldn't fool him at a critical juncture, let alone Damian who he was especially cautious of.\n\"… I can't take it anymore!\"\nDamian's voice snapped Leonel out of his thoughts even as the fluid earth wrapped around the latter's wrist and ankles fell with a 'plop'.\nThe lieutenant's face paled, his arms falling and trembling to his side. It was only now that Leonel remembered that this guy probably had numerous fractures in his forearms. It was a wonder he had been able to keep up the act for long.\n\"What are you standing around for?! Hurry up and heal me! This kid is a little devil.\"\nDamian had completely lost his noble air. He looked no different from a little boy complaining to his big brother, a sight that left Leonel rather speechless. He had always wanted a little sibling since he was an only child, but he felt like changing his mind after seeing this.\nLeonel had only barely had this thought when he realized that the man Damian was speaking to actually resembled him quite a bit. Could they actually be brothers?\nThey were about the same height, had the same sandy tanned skin, and both had deep brown eyes.\nAfter appeasing Damian, the second man walked forward and smiled amiably.\n\"I'm Vice Commander Joseph Warner, it's nice to meet you.\"\n'Same last name? So they are indeed brothers…'\nLeonel smiled in return. \"Leonel Morales. What exactly is it that you two want me to do? I'd like to make something clear first. Though I'm alright with collaborating with Slayer Legion to take down Royal Blue Fort, I have yet to decide to join you all longterm.\"\nJoseph raised an eyebrow and looked toward his younger brother. They had just gotten here, so he obviously hadn't had the opportunity to learn what Leonel's requests were.\nSoon, he learned of everything and fell into pensive thought.\n\"… Taking down the Fort would indeed be a good opportunity. In addition, we might be able to recruit some fresh blood as well. I'm certain that there are many common folk who are unsatisfied with the Junior Governor Duke's actions.\"\n\"I was surprised.\" Leonel suddenly interjected. \"I thought it would be harder to convince you two to attack the Fort. Why is it easier for you to agree to this in comparison to helping me remove this wrist watch?\"\nJoseph and Damian looked at each other and smiled.\n\"You're new to the Slayer Legion, but you've probably already seen that things aren't what they appear on the surface. Most of our public appearances are just facades. For now, we haven't truly formed up.\n\"Lieutenants and above have quite a bit of freedom at our current stage. You can almost consider us like ancient time generals who can take action without consulting with our king first. This gives us greater flexibility and better adaptability. Since this region is the territory we oversee, whether to attack the Fort or not is entirely up to us two brothers.\n\"However… the wrist watch is a special case. The secrets behind how to remove it are tightly guarded by the highest echelons of our Slayer Legion.\"\nLeonel's lips curled. \"Shouldn't you be giving me a speech about how noble your cause is and that you would stop at nothing to end the Empire's tyranny? Why are you so blatantly exposing that you're hoarding such important secrets to yourselves?\"\nJoseph laughed. \"No one is so noble. While it's true that we don't agree with the paths the Empire has taken and do believe that we have the higher moral authority, we aren't angels either.\n\"Like all organizations, we need a hierarchy, we need incentives, we need our people to have goals to strive for. This is the only way.\"\nLeonel quite appreciated Joseph's attitude. He had expected to find some cliche, die-hard rebels with tragic backstories that were worth the tears of all the women in the world, but what he actually found was much more real. Though these two brothers might still have faced some sort of tragedy in their past, at least for now, it wasn't important.\nAfter thinking this far, Leonel nodded internally. The trouble with taking this watch off wasn't just how sturdy it was. Though the material was hard, there were many things that could still destroy it. The trouble was finding something that could destroy it without taking his hand and most likely his arm along with it. That was much more difficult.\n\"Alright, that's enough of that. My brother made the right decision, taking on the Fort is a good opportunity and will provide us with far more rewards than what scavenging these broken buildings can. But, we'll need to wait for the rest of our team to get back before we can start planning something like this.\"\n\"Rest of your team?\" Leonel's brows raised with interest.\n\"Yes. They're the main force of my brother and I, they can be considered to be the true elites of our Division. But, right now they're training themselves in several Zones. Of course, we've already had a few clashes with the Fort over Zone entries as well.\"\nLeonel couldn't help but be quite confused at these words. Did Sub-Dimensional Zones only appear on land? What about the vast ocean? Was there a need for them to fight over Zones on land if there was so much vast space on the ocean?\n\"It's about time we report in anyway. They should be back in a half a month to a month at most. After that, we'll have to go back to base and report our progress like we do every half year. You can take that opportunity to learn a bit more about us. We really are the best option for a fugitive like yourself.\"\nLeonel inwardly chuckled. This was somehow both the best and worst pitch meeting imaginable. Ultimately, Joseph was right. He was nothing but a fugitive. Where else could he go if not to them?\n\"That said… In the meantime, you'll have to help us put on a little show.\"\nLeonel had a bad feeling when he heard Damian's words and saw his evil smile. He looked like a man excited to finally get his revenge.\nDamian took out a collar from who-knows-where. Leonel couldn't help but shiver when he saw arcs of electricity coursing through two small silver plates hidden on its inner lining.\n\"It can't be…\" Leonel's jaw clenched.\n\"Don't run away little brat, you really made me suffer before.\" Damian's grin grew wider. \"You just need to obediently act like a little slave for a small while.\"",

      "content": "\"You've seen him too, right?\"\n\"Hmph, serves him right. Wasn't it very stupid of him to come here alone? He must have thought himself to be invincible, but didn't Lieutenant Warner take him down just the same?\"\n\"Lower your voice a bit.\" The one who spoke sent a playful smack to the back of his friend's head. \"That's still a person who took down an A-grade Invalid on his own. He could kill you with a glare.\"\nThe recipient of the smack laughed.\n\"Kill me? With that thing around his neck? Even if he had a wrong thought he'd be fried into barbecue chicken.\"\nConversations like this seemed to happen all the time these days. Whenever a group passed by the pillar at the gate of their harbor, their thoughts would inevitably drift to the young man forced to stand guard there.\nHe stood atop the pillar, legs crossed. His hair and immature beard were just as unkempt while his clothing was just as casual. But, now, he had a collar wrapped tightly around his neck that flickered with arcs of electricity from time to time.\n\"What are you two doing around here?! Scram!\"\nA sudden roar shocked the two gossiping men, sending them scurrying into a distance. Comparing Gerolt's large physique to themselves, they knew they didn't stand much of a chance.\nGerolt looked up at the young man who sat on the pillar and sighed. The young man didn't seem to notice his presence, but could Gerolt blame him? Scaring away those who ran their mouths too much was about the best he could do.\n'It's not right. None of them seem to remember that that damned lieutenant wasn't the one to step out and save their lives, it was Leonel who did. Since he could defeat Leonel, why didn't he step out earlier to kill that A-grade threat?'\nGerolt was fuming, but he couldn't even raise up his courage to contradict Sela who was nothing more than a captain. How could he do anything against a lieutenant?\nAfter casting another glance toward Leonel, Gerolt turned and left.\nLeonel, who was on top of the pillar, didn't seem to have much of a reaction to this. For one, none of them knew that he wasn't actually a prisoner, this was just a facade. Even the electric collar on his neck was just a little trick, it did little more than leave his skin a bit numb. And second, if he interacted with Gerolt on friendly terms, that would probably make this whole act a waste. So, he ignored him.\nHis life was pretty leisurely right now, in fact. He had become the 'guard dog' of the rebels, standing guard here for 12 hours everyday. For others, this might have been a complete waste of time. But, with his Dream World, Leonel could still progress.\nLeonel found that when he did nothing but clear his mind and meditate like this, he had thoughts and ideas he never even considered before. In an age of technology, people rarely took time to themselves. And, even when he entered Zones which had no such distractions, he was constantly on guard, worrying about his life.\nBut now, he could breathe and relax. This whole pretending to be a prisoner gig wasn't half bad.\n'… I'm such an idiot, why didn't I think of that? Since Metal Spirits are known for their corrosive ability and in the art of refining metals, can't I just have the little guy melt this wrist watch for me? I wouldn't even need the Slayer Legion at that point.'\nThis was just one of Leonel's many fleeting thoughts. In fact, he felt that he could just barely split his thoughts into two streams, allowing them to draw conjectures along two completely different avenues. It was almost like combining the computing power of two computers to gain results faster.\nLeonel had barely grasped this ability when he was escaping back to the Fort. He had been trying to absorb the primitive man's combat experience as quickly as possible and formed three simulations in his Dream World. However, the third had been so bare bones that it could hardly be considered one. So, two was Leonel's real limit, and even then, it drained his spirit very quickly without the support of [Dimensional Cleanse].\nStill, this was only a fleeting thought of Leonel's. Right now, he still didn't dare to touch the little guy with his bare hands and he only had protective gear for his palms and fingers. His wrist would still be exposed. So, without some experience or assurances, he wouldn't dare to act rashly just yet.\nIn reality, this was a thought Leonel had had days ago. What he was focused on now was completely different.\n'Just where is the perfect location for my Ninth Node?'\nIf before Leonel wasn't very worried about this, believing he had time to figure it out, he was now getting a bit anxious.\nIn the past month or so, he had already formed his Fourth and Fifth Nodes within the lab. He could form his Sixth any time as well, but hadn't because he needed to allow the lab to accumulate more Force, or else he would run out when it came time to form his Second Star.\nIt could be said that Leonel faced practically none of the bottlenecks Aina had mentioned. In fact, his speed was blinding to the point of being incredulous. If there were knowledgeable individuals monitoring his progress, they'd be numbed with shock.\nIt should be mentioned that Earth only had a few million people left of their population. The rest had either died during the Paradise Island tragedy or become Invalids. Of those people, those like Aina who had families pass down Force cultivation techniques to them numbered in the few hundred at most. All others had to earn their own in Zones just like Leonel…\nNow, considering this, how many could get a good technique? Even if you put aside the fact that Leonel's technique was among the best in the Fourth Dimension and didn't mind the fact not just anyone would be able to get a Tier 9 Black reward… what then?\nThis was all to say that Leonel's strength was frightening. Those who had as many Force Nodes as him had all begun long before the Metamorphosis truly descended.\nBut now, his own speed was knipping at his heels. At this pace, it wouldn't be long before he formed his Eighth Node… But he still had no idea where his Ninth should go!",

      "content": "Leonel's brow furrowed as his mind spun. At the same time, his fingers stretched in odd positions, moving them like individual striking snakes.\nHis First Node was with his brain stem. His Second and Third Nodes were along his spine. His Fourth and Fifth Nodes were fused into the walls of his lungs. According to his current plan, his Sixth Node would be fused into his stomach. The Seventh and Eighth Nodes would be split between the chambers controlling the outgoing flow of his blood and the ingoing flow.\nUp to this point, this arrangement had a near 100% compatibility with him and he felt that it was near flawless. Yet, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find a Ninth Node with as much compatibility with him.\nIf others knew about Leonel's arrangement of Force Nodes, they just might call him insane. Most sought after boosts to strength in their arms and legs — essentially, things that could directly upgrade their battle prowess as quickly as possible. Yet, all of Leonel's choices were supplemental, yet absolutely perfect for laying a foundation.\nWith Nodes in his spine and brain, when his Force was activated, and even passively, his thinking speed and reaction time was exponentially better than his peers. The Nodes in his lungs increased his air intake and oxygen siphoning ability. The Nodes within his heart would perfectly supplement the increased capacity of his lungs, not to mention the Node in his stomach as well.\nUltimately, the blood was the centerpiece of the body, it was interwoven and interconnected with every corner, right along with the nervous system. So, in Leonel's mind, forming his nodes with these two systems as the core was only right.\nBut now, he was at a loss. He even began to doubt himself somewhat. What if he was wrong from the very beginning? He had indeed started to choose the locations of his Nodes without consulting anyone…\nLeonel had always been confident in himself. Maybe a bit too confident considering all the mistakes he had made since the Metamorphosis descended. However, he still felt certain that he wasn't taking an incorrect path…\nLeonel's head snapped up to look into the distance. He stood.\n'Another one, huh…'\nWith a sigh, Leonel hopped down from the pillar, causing those who had come back after Gerolt left to scurry off and hide once more. Who knew why these people were so bored to hang around him like this just so that they could make sure that he heard their words.\nIt had been quite a long while since Leonel had dealt with such a thing. If he recalled correctly, during his first few weeks in the Royal Blue Education System, he was quite looked down upon since he lived on a Paradise island. But, by now, that seemed like a lifetime ago.\nAfter making his rounds and wiping out the approaching Invalids once again, Leonel once again pretended to 'run away', only to be zapped back into submission by the collar around his neck.\nHe was quite used to this routine after half a month. He walked back to the harbor with head lowered and his hair hiding his eyes once again.\n\"Another escape attempt? Seems I'll have to speak with Lieutenant Warner about this. I'm not sure why you can't just be an obedient guard dog.\"\nThe first time Leonel heard this voice, he thought it came from a respectable female captain. Now when he heard it, he only managed to feel annoyed. Why this Captain Sela insisted on being so annoying was beyond him.\nThat said, he wasn't very surprised by her appearance. After all, in order to keep up appearances and not raise suspicion, Captain Sela was tasked with overseeing what she called his duties as a 'guard dog'.\nLike always, Leonel simply ignored her. Once the matters with the Fort were concluded, there would no longer be a need for him to stay here. He could pretend that Damian brought himself elsewhere or that he escaped. Either one would be fine.\nCaptain Sela watched with a pleased smile as Leonel obediently walked back into the harbor. The side of her face was still bandaged from her previous injuries, making her look even worse than she usually did.\nOnce he had disappeared, gone now that his 12 hour shift was concluded, her smile disappeared and became indifferent. First she ensured that the next guards took up their duty. Leonel alone was enough to guard half the day, but several dozen men and women were needed when he was off duty. After accomplishing this, she headed back to her quarters.\nShe seemed to relax after getting back into her room, her burly figure suddenly changing its gait to that of an elegant woman with swaying hips. But the issue was… her silhouette made those who saw it want to vomit instead of appreciate the sight.\nStill, without a care, she walked to the bathroom, humming a little tune as her clothes fell to the ground one by one. It wasn't long until a blubbery, top heavy figure appeared. Still, it was more toned than one might expect. What happened next, though, was astonishing.\nCaptain Sela's burly body began to shrink as she sauntered toward the bathroom. By the time she stepped off the hardwood and onto the tiles, her figure had become slender and the backview was enticing to the point of inducing a nose bleed.\nHer bottom became pert with just the right amount of jiggle. Her slender legs moved along with her hips, following a hypnotizing rhythm. The sight one could behold when she finally reclined in a pre-made wooden bath could make the blood boil. The clear water could hardly hide the shapeliness of her soft breasts.\nAs if all of this wasn't enough, she shed the bandages on her face, revealing delicate features that brought her looks together with a bow. She was most definitely a prime beauty, the likes of which few could match.\nAt that moment, a slight vibration came from her wrist.\n< \"Report.\" >\nA commanding tone demanded from the other end, but the sound waves were so unique that no one but Captain Sela herself could hear them.\n\"… Things are going well. I should be receiving a promotion soon.\"\nAfter giving her usual report, Captain Sela ended it with these words.\nThere was a long pause on the other end.\n< \"You don't see anything fishy about all of this?\" >\nCaptain Sela shrugged. \"It doesn't matter. Even if it's all a ploy, they'll give me appropriate rewards so that I can continue shielding Leonel Morales. By then, I will start displaying some of my true abilities and they will recognize me for other reasons. It took me decades to become a captain, but now I can become a colonel. Who cares if it's just a ploy?\"\nThe voice was silent for a long time once again but didn't respond. After a while, it became obvious that the person hung up.\nCaptain Sela reclined with a smile, a devilishly beautiful curl coating her lips.\n\"You're using me? Well, I'm using you too…\" She said with a light giggle.\nIf Leonel were here, he would finally remember just why it was he had smelt a familiar fragrance from Captain Sela. It was because the slender woman in the tub was precisely the very same Secretary Marquisette Maia he met at Royal Blue Fort.",

      "content": "Another half month passed by in a flash. Finally, the teammates Damian and his brother Joseph had spoken of before had made their way back, making the empty 200 meter wooden yacht far more lively.\nLeonel didn't have much interaction with these people. Though Damian and Joseph claimed to trust them with their lives, the less people who knew a secret, the better. As a result, Leonel stayed in a room on the lowest level of the boat and didn't leave. Obviously, his guard duties had been passed on to someone else.\nJoseph had said that a high-level recruit like himself had to go through a deeper acceptance process. However, Leonel had seen through a while ago that this 'vetting' process was not much different from the Empire marking down all his secrets and treasures. The Slayer Legion and the Ascension Empire really didn't seem to have much of a difference between them from what Leonel had seen. One just happened to be weaker than the other, or so it seemed.\nDespite knowing this, Leonel played along. He was truly curious to know more about the Slayer Legion. Aina had said that success in the future could influence the past, so who knows? If the Slayer Legion gained a modicum of success with their endeavors, they might be able to provide him with certain benefits now.\nEither way, Leonel felt like he needed to see more of the world. The problem of his Ninth Node was weighing on his mind. Though he knew that completing the evolution and gaining a Fourth Dimensional Body could be done with just one Force Node, he obviously wanted to succeed with all nine.\nLike this, Damian and Joseph separated. Joseph remained behind to oversee their lesser recruits while Damian led them toward what he called their checkpoint. According to the latter, the checkpoint changed every half year and was a floating military base. All those in their sector would converge toward it.\nSince Royal Blue Province was ranked third amongst the Provinces, there were quite a few big shots assigned to this Sector. In addition, the Slayer Legion was several factors more lawless for obvious reasons. So, Damian warned him to be careful.\nStill, it would take several more days to reach the checkpoint, so Leonel wasn't thinking about such things currently. Instead, he had entered the Segmented Cube once more and was finally forming his Sixth Node.\nViolent swirls of Force surged into Leonel's body. He was like a bottomless hole, devouring Force that had been accumulating for a whole month without any reserve.\nJust like before, his Sixth Node formed in just half an hour before sweeping changes took hold of his Ethereal Glabella, forming a second star that pulsed just as brightly as the first.\nLeonel's body began to squirm and tremble. If one looked closely, it was possible to see muscle fibers wiggling beneath his skin, bulging and compressing again and again in an endless cycle.\nAccording to the creator of [Dimensional Cleanse], forming a One Star Constitution was enough to make you the cream of the crop. After forming it, the impurities in Leonel's body were expelled in droves. This process expelled much of the lingering shackles of a Third DImensional Body. As long as this step was reached, forming a Fourth Dimensional Body wouldn't pose any issue at all.\nHowever, in the end, this was just the first step. In fact, its impact could be considered to be the smallest of the three Stars, and for good reason.\nThe Second Star was a true remolding. Though the pain surpassed even when Leonel formed his First Node, the benefits were countless times more potent. It wasn't just Leonel's muscle fibers that were breaking down, reforming, and compacting in on themselves, but even his bones and inner organs.\nAs Leonel clenched his jaw, the crackling of his bones could be heard. The longer the process went on, the brighter the glow of his skin seemed to become. He looked like a deity who had stepped down from a loftier world, come to spread his blessings.\nLeonel's hair fell once more as layers of his skin began to shed, but this time, it grew back much faster. He felt as though his whole body was somehow both being broken down by a sledgehammer and floating on a cloud. The two contrasting feelings left him in a complete daze, as though his mind could slip away at any moment.\nBut, he pushed through. Much like a Lineage Factor would give more benefits the longer one retained their consciousness, so too would the formation of the Second Star. Leonel had no intention of letting this opportunity go.\nFor some reason, he had still failed to awaken his Spear Force. And, he had yet to awaken his Metal Synergy Lineage either. In the end, the only option he had for increasing his power quickly were his Force Nodes and his constitution. And… They most definitely didn't let him down.\nLeonel felt that not just his body, but his Internal Sight and his ability were strengthening many times over. Before, the region of sharpness for his Internal Sight was just 200 meters, but he felt it rapidly doubling. At the same time, he felt his Dream World growing sharper and could tell, even without testing it, that his simulations would be a few degrees more accurate.\nLeonel could once more sense the endless potential of his ability. It might not be as flashy as Damian's, but if he used it appropriately… The sky was the limit.\nOver half a day later, Leonel finally opened his eyes, his body covered from head to toe in sweat. The situation was so bad that there was even a shallow puddle beneath him. Though his breathing was heavy, his eyes shone like two lanterns, a deep rooted confidence growing within him.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 1.99; Speed: 1.78; Agility: 1.83; Coordination: 2.01; Stamina: 2.13 (+0.05 - nullified); Reactions: 2.03; Spirit: 2.32; Force: 0.60]\nLeonel's new stats left him speechless. Just what kind of strength was this?\n\"Scan my ability.\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Evolution Stage: Tier 3 Bronze ]\n[ Evolution Type: Sensory ]\n[ Evolution: Dream World, Dream Sculpt ]\n[ Dream World: A virtual world formed in the mind capable of running simulations of the real world with a certain degree of accuracy. ]\n[ Dream Sculpt: Ability to create a perfect, immutable, and unforgettable memory fragment with 100% accuracy. ]\nLeonel's eyes widened. 'My ability was Quasi Bronze before, but now it's Tier 3 Bronze?!'\nThough Leonel didn't know much about this new world order, he was absolutely certain that having an ability that surpassed their Dimensional Grade was ridiculous. One had to remember that the 'Black Grade' was assigned to the Fourth Dimension. This was why high level abilities could swing battles so fiercely, especially since Earth was still a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional World.\nLeonel had the equivalent of a Fifth Dimensional ability! Of course, this was still ranked very low amongst the Fifth Dimension, but its influence on the Pseudo Fourth Dimension could be imagined. After breaking through this barrier, Leonel was certain that his simulations would all be above 90% now.\n'Hm?'\nLeonel's eyes widened once more. He hadn't even finished being astonished by his improvement when he noticed something about his hands.\nHe had reached the Advanced Grade One designation…",

      "content": "Leonel looked at his hands, feeling a bit shocked.\nHe was certain that he had still not reached Grade One designation yet even after almost two months of diligent training. But now, he had suddenly leaped over that and reached the Advanced Grade One designation? There was only one explanation… [Dimensional Cleanse].\nLeonel was pleasantly surprised. Did this mean that when he formed his Third Star he would be able to reach the Superior Grade One designation without forming Force Nodes in his hands?\nLeonel's eyes brightened, immediately taking back all the disparaging remarks he had made about the technique's creator. Even now, he had vastly underestimated [Dimensional Cleanse], he had never thought it would be this good.\n'I have to find a way to get my hands on the latter parts. If the upper portions are as good as this first part, that would be amazing.'\nLeonel laughed like a little kid, testing out his fingers as though he was playing the air like a piano. He felt almost like a newborn baby with the coordination and strength of an adult. His fingers felt so fresh that he couldn't even crack them.\n'I can finally listen to the third book.'\nLeonel didn't care about anything else and immediately immersed himself within the teachings his father left behind. Unknowingly, Force Crafting had become less about a competition between him and his father and more about his own curiosity. Even he himself didn't realize just how eager he had been to learn more until now.\nThe feeling of being blocked off for so long left him feeling a bit anxious. But all that weight was now gone and he smiled like a little kid.\n**\nA week later, Leonel finally stood on the deck of the wooden yacht. He could feel curious gazes shooting off toward him from time to time, but since Lieutenant Damian didn't say much about him, those around didn't question it either. They immediately knew that Leonel must be some new recruit.\nLeonel wasn't paying very much attention to the stares, though. Instead, he was looking toward the behemoth of a structure in the distance. He had no idea that the mobile checkpoint would really be so… monstrous.\nIt was a massive steel structure that stood like a metal box in the ocean. Even towering waves didn't seem capable of shifting it one way or another. It was so impossibly immobile that Leonel had a hard time believing that this place was capable of moving at all.\nBut, this was where the descriptions ended. Aside from some landing pads for helicopters and runways for planes, there were no other landmarks on the massive steel behemoth. Leonel could only guess that all of its most important structures were hidden within.\n'What a feat…' Leonel thought with a light gasp.\n\"Impressive, huh kid?\" Damian grinned, slapping Leonel's back hard.\n\"Shouldn't you be focused on steering the ship?\"\nIf Leonel took his eyes off of the floating checkpoint, he could see numerous ships approaching from all angles. A few were even nearby and sailing along in parallel. But, none of these ships were wooden like Damian's. It was either Damian's sector had poor funding, or Damian purposely chose this design to make use of his ability.\nDamian rubbed his nose, laughing lightly.\n\"So you saw through that too, huh? I only take control of the ship when we're forced into a corner. It's a trump card, so I don't use it casually.\"\n\"I see…\" Leonel mumbled.\n\"Hey, Lieutenant? Are you really still not going to tell us who the kid is?\"\nA lady wearing a skin-tight black jumpsuit walked over, her eyes watery with grievances as though she might start crying at any moment. The first thought Leonel had about her was that if catwoman was real and jumped out from her comic, this was what she would be like.\n\"He's a new recruit, you can call him Leo.\"\nThe lady's eyes brightened. \"In the past, new recruits never got to go to the checkpoint. It was only after the Metamorphosis began that they changed the rule to make an exception for a certain group of people. Don't tell me you're a Variant like Lieutenant?\"\nMany curious gazes looked over.\n\"Come on, kid. Show me your power, quick, quick. I'm curious.\"\nLeonel scratched the back of his head awkwardly.\n\"I can't, my ability is a sensory type.\"\nThe lady pouted in dissatisfaction, but her curiosity had been piqued. She had heard of Variants with all sorts of wild and crazy abilities. Her Lieutenant alone could overturn the oceans, just how crazy was that? But, she had never heard of a sensory type Variant. She wondered what Leonel could do.\n\"Alright, alright. Stop hounding the rookie. We're here.\"\nAt first, Leonel thought that the wooden yacht would crash into the side of the massive floating metal cube. But, instead, a tunnel opened up on the side.\nLeonel was mystified. He wondered what sort of clever engineering allowed such a thing to happen without the whole compound being flooded with salt water. But, his thoughts didn't have much of a chance to linger on this before he was astonished once more.\nThe dark tunnel ended and flooded them with light, opening them up to a huge hidden city.\nLeonel was quite used to big cities. After all, he traveled through one everyday to get to school barely a year earlier. But this one left him fascinated.\nWithout the sun, the city had no choice but to rely on high-res panels that simulated the sky. As though realizing this wasn't enough, the light yellow glow of lanterns could be seen dotted all around the skyline, looking like fireflies buzzing in the night.\nThe city below wasn't nearly as congested either. It had a homey feeling, as though everyone knew everyone else.\nThe most magical thing, though, was its reminiscence of Venice, Italy, a city Leonel had read about in the past. The large wooden yacht could float through the city with ease, allowing Leonel to take everything in.\nIt was beautiful.",

      "content": "The wooden yacht slowly went through the city, following loops and curls until it finally docked at a busy harbor.\nUp ahead, a building that looked quite similar to a grand city hall stood. Instead of having doors, it had large archways that accepted ingoing and outgoing traffic. The entire first floor was open to the wind and elements while the above floors stood on the archways as though they were their legs.\nOf the many docked ships at the harbor, groups of people walked out. They were all armed with various weapons. Some wore half or full armors, others wore robes like priests, and some others were dressed quite normally. If it wasn't for the Metamorphosis, Leonel would have thought this to be some sort of comic convention.\n\"Let's go.\" Damian spoke to his team before turning his attention to Leonel.\n\"This building is called the Southern Lookout. Those with Sectors located in the south have to come here to report every half year. In addition, it's also the place we come to introduce the new members of our elite teams.\"\nLeonel nodded in understanding and followed along, sweeping his Internal Sight over as much as he could and committing them to memory.\nSoon, the group had lined up in a long queue. The process somewhat baffled Leonel. Why was all of this so bureaucratic?\n\"… the rankings had some movement.\"\n\"Really? What happened?\"\n\"I heard that 'Chasing Wind' killed a target with an S-grade evaluation so they moved up from the fourth spot to the third, pushing down 'Thunderous Clap' by one.\"\nLeonel, in all his boredom, caught a few conversations with his Internal Sight. He found that he could use this sixth sense of his not only as an eye in the sky, but also as an extension of his other senses. If he wanted to, he could even 'feel' like he was touching someone who was hundreds of meters away from him.\nThat said, he was very careful with this ability. For one, it drained his spirit much faster than when he just used it for sight. Secondly, when he used it as an extension of his touch, others seemed to notice. And, thirdly… let's just say he had regretted using it as an extension of his nose already. It was just once, but to him, that was enough for a lifetime.\n\"There are rankings?\" Leonel asked Damian.\n\"Rankings? Yes. How do you know about that?\"\n\"I just overheard a conversation. Something about 'Chasing Wind' and 'Thunderous Clap'?\"\n\"Hehe, you've heard of them too, kid?\" Catwoman, as Leonel liked to refer to her, interjected, pushing her soft cheeks between the arms of Damian and Leonel.\n\"According to the higher ups, youths below the age of 30 adapt to the Metamorphosis far better than the older generation does. It's an unfortunate reality, but the truth. Our abilities have far more room for evolution than those old fogies.\n\"The ranking is just a little competition between the shining stars of the Slayer Legion. We have a list called the 'Empire's Swine' list. Threats are ranked on it. In order to move up the 'Promising Future' rankings, you gain contribution points from taking out threats on that list.\"\nWhen Leonel heard this, his interest dimmed down by several measures. He had no intention of getting so involved with the Slayer Legion, and even if he did, he didn't very much like the idea of targeting people just because they were a little talented. If they had committed atrocities, that was one thing. But if they were just casually living their lives and making contributions to the Empire, Leonel didn't believe that they deserved to die.\nHowever, there was still one more thing he was curious about.\n\"'Chasing Wind' and 'Thunderous Clap', those are aliases?\"\n\"Mhm, mhm.\" Catwoman answered for Damian once again. \"The real name of such talents are always hidden. We have our own confidential system to verify their contributions. But, the top priority is ensuring that they're not in turn targeted by the Empire.\"\nLeonel nodded, finally understanding. If possible, he would also like to go by an alias.\nAn hour later, it was finally their turn. They made it to the front to find a long counter. Behind each station, there was an older gentleman or woman waiting. According to Damian, they were rebels who had already retired from service. Obviously, the Slayer Legion wouldn't treat them poorly after they had given their whole lives to the cause. So, many of the simpler, less physically intensive, tasks were given to them.\nHowever, they might have been a bit too old because the man manning the counter Damian, Leonel and the others were assigned to was dozing off to the point of lightly snoring. Even after ringing the small bell on the counter, he wasn't stirred.\nIt was only after the impatient catwoman pressed the bell a few times in a row that the old man's head, which had been nodding away, snapped awake.\nThe old man groggily yawned, smacking his lips as though telling himself that the nap was good. The members of Damian's team seemed to realize that it wasn't the catwoman's actions who woke the old man up, but rather that he got up because he felt like it. Toward this, they could only bitterly smile.\nThough this old man was just a receptionist, they couldn't afford to be rude. Sometimes, the retirees here were once bigwigs who surpassed even Damian's brother in rank. Even when they weren't such big shots, the Slayer Legion protected them to a fault. After all, if an organization didn't protect their veterans, they were finished. Who would wholeheartedly work for them?\nSo, they could only watch as the old man picked up a phone by the counter and dialed a number.\n\"… Yes… Mhm… The usual please… Extra cheese and meat… Don't forget to leave a kiss on the box like you usually do…\" The old man giggled lewdly, almost like he was a teen secretly chatting with his girlfriend while trying not to wake his parents up.\nThe catwoman was irritated many times and was even muttering to herself, but the old man pretended not to hear anything.\nAfter a while, he set down the phone. But, just when Damian was ready to step forward… he actually reached toward his pocket and pulled out a box of cigarettes.\n\"… Ah, break time.\" He said with a light smile, about to walk away.\nBlack lines formed across Damian's forehead. If the old man really left, they would need to join another queue, all to wait yet another hour. Others couldn't help but look toward them with pitying gazes.\nJust as the old man was about to leave, he swept a glance over the group as though to apologize. But who would believe he was sincere with the way he had acted until now?\nIt was then, though, that his gaze stopped on Leonel who also had a bitter smile on his face.\nThe old man's eyes widened. \"It's you!\"\nLeonel blinked in confusion. 'Could it be this man knows what I did at the Fort? That wouldn't be good right…?'\nHe looked toward Damian with a bit of worry in his eyes, but he could have never expected what he heard next.\n\"Leonel Morales, right? Greatest quarterback prospect in the last century? Can I have your autograph?!\"\nAt this point, let alone everyone else, even Leonel was speechless.",

      "content": "Leonel scratched the back of his head, feeling a bit embarrassed.\nThe truth was, even he, himself, had almost forgotten just how famous he was. But, he had neglected that fact for good reason.\nFirst, it had been too long. His life of training everyday for football seemed like a lifetime ago. After all, it had been a bit over a year now since the Metamorphosis began and he had experienced longer than that within Zones.\nSecond, even if he was still playing football, people coming up to him like this was rare. After all, he usually lived on a Paradise Island. Everyone who lived on one was like family. They had watched him grow up, so obviously they wouldn't fanboy over him. And, when he wasn't home, he was on campus. Who on their campus wasn't an elite of an elite, obviously they wouldn't fawn over him like this.\nThirdly, he had still been an academy student. His level of fame compared to a player in the NAFL was still lacking. It could be said that he was only approaching them in name recognition because he was among the very best academy players of all time.\nAnd, finally… football was a sport where everyone wore helmets. The average fan wouldn't be very familiar with his face to begin with. Only those who loved the sport and followed it diligently would know his face at first glance like this old man did.\nStill, the embarrassment Leonel was feeling wasn't because the old man had spoken too loudly or even because numerous gazes had fallen onto him. Rather, he was embarrassed that he had neglected something so important.\nHow was he supposed to keep hiding his identity like this? By now, at the very least, those in the immediate vicinity all knew his name. And, because he hadn't thought anyone would be able to link his face to the Fort incident, he hadn't come with his face covered either.\nIt seemed he had made another mistake.\n\"Sure.\" Leonel finally said, knowing he didn't have much of a way out of this.\nThe old man laughed like a little kid. His thoughts of going out for a smoke were thrown to the back of his mind. He hounded Leonel with questions, not minding the weird gazes he was getting.\nIt was only then that those who didn't follow football began asking around and finally learned a bit about who Leonel was. Of course, you couldn't expect everyone to be sports fans, but this day was the day Leonel learned that even those who couldn't be said to be his fans still recognized his name.\nLeonel smiled bitterly. 'It seems that Royal Blue Academy made quite a bit of money marketing my name. Shouldn't I be a rich man, then? Why haven't I seen any of that money?\"\n\"… Ah, look at me.\" The old man smacked his own forehead. \"I completely forgot to introduce myself. You can call me Hutch or Old Man Hutch. I'm a big fan of yours, Morales. The game has gotten softer over the years, so I had lost interest in watching the NAFL. On a whim, I decided to watch the Academy League and haven't missed a single game of yours since. It's such a shame that the NAFL has been suspended until further notice, or else I would have loved to watch you teach those so-called professionals how to play.\"\nThe old man rambled on and on. He seemingly had an endless supply of air to give to his words.\n'This man's breath control is outstanding.'\nOthers might gloss over this, but Leonel was shocked. Ever since he formed his Fourth and Fifth Nodes into his lungs, he had been experimenting with breath control. It was a wonder just how much of a difference a perfectly timed breath made to power output. There was a reason there was a recommended breathing rhythm whenever one lifted weights.\nDamian, the catwoman, and the others, though, were frozen.\n\"Vixen…\" Damian mumbled toward the catwoman in a low voice. \"… What did he just say his name was? Did I hear correctly?\"\nThe catwoman gulped, her alluring aura completely gone.\n\"H-Hutch… He definitely said Hu - Hutch…\"\n\"He couldn't mean the Hacker Hutch, right…?\"\nThe catwoman's lips trembled, but she didn't dare to nod. Because if she did, the reality would be too scary.\nHutch was a legend. He was one of the best software engineers in history and unsurprisingly gained a Five Star evaluation during his Gene Analysis Exam.\nHowever, this wasn't a reason to fear him, one might say. Was there a need to be afraid of such a man? So what if he was good with computers?\nAnd therein lied the problem…. The Hacker Hutch was a play on words. He was known for his wizardry in software engineering. But, he was even more known for hacking his opponents to death.\nIn a civilization of advanced technology like theirs, there should have been no reason for anyone to use weapons in such a fashion. It was barely alright now that the Metamorphosis had descended. However, obviously, Hutch was retired, so his era was long before the Metamorphosis.\nJust what kind of sick, sadistic person did you need to be to gain such a nickname in this era? He had all sorts of fantastical weapons to choose from that would cause the military officials of the 21st century to drool. Even during his era, even mechsuits fitted with machine guns wasn't an impossible ask.\nYet… The old man preferred a blade. Not just any blade either, but specifically a machete.\nThat was right, the amiable old man fanboying over Leonel without a care in the world, even tossing aside his own dignity without a care for the thoughts of others, was a man known for dissecting his enemies with a bloody, rusted machete. It was certain that even the upper echelons of the Empire feared his name.\nAs for his former title, it was above even Joseph's Vice Commander title. In his prime, he was known as Supreme Hutch. That alone was four levels of rank beyond Joseph.",

      "content": "Under Hutch's rain of questions, Leonel could only smile and take it. Compared to this old man, he wasn't nearly as passionate about football, but he didn't mind talking about the game he devoted so much of his life to. Even compared to the old man who seemed to have dedicated his whole retirement to the sport, he was several levels above.\n\"… Aiya, I has hoped to one day become a coach, but it seems that my knowledge is still too lacking. As expected, as expected.\"\nLeonel's lip twitched. How would a rebel become a coach, exactly? He'd be lucky if the Empire didn't point all their weapons toward him the moment he even stepped foot into one of their provinces.\nHowever, Hutch seemed completely unaware of his status. Or, maybe he was just so free and unrestrained that he dared to do anything. He was quite an adorable old man, Leonel couldn't help but take a liking to him.\nOf course, Leonel had no idea about his past. If others knew he was calling Hacker Hutch adorable, the weird gazes he received would probably drown him in embarrassment.\n\"Ai, look at me, rambling on and on. You came here for the check-in, right? No problem, no problem. Just have your leader come forward.\"\nLeonel smiled and turned toward Damian. But, his expression turned a bit weird when he saw just how pale Damian's face was. Was there a need to react like this? It can't be that Damian was a fan as well, right?\nAfter a while, Damian realized that he should probably pull himself together. If he made Hacker Hutch wait, who knew if this old man wouldn't hack him to pieces next.\nHe cleared his throat with maybe too much strength before stepping forward.\n\"Yes, your honorable. We're here for our biannual check-in. I've already prepared the report, please take a look.\"\nHow could he dare to call Hacker Hutch by his name? Let alone the fact he didn't know if the old man was fond of his nickname or not.\nDamian respectfully handed a file over. If one opened it up, one wouldn't find words at all. Rather, it was all written in a special kind of braille that was almost imperceptible to the eye. This 'braille' was a special language that only the computers of the Slayer Legion could understand. This allowed the process to be expedited and also kept confidential.\nHowever, what shocked Damian was that instead of feeding the files into the computer like one was supposed to, Hutch actually began to… read it? What the hell was going on?\n\"Hm? Why don't I see anything about Morales on here?\"\nDamian's eyes widened. It can't be that the old man actually read it, right? That's impossible! Let alone the fact it was hard to even see the braille, each file was encoded. The possible combinations couldn't even be counted in the trillions. How was this even possible?\n\"… He is a new recruit. Actually, we were planning on registering him today as well.\"\n\"Oh? So it's like this? Alright. I'll register him beneath my Fleet, then.\"\nOnce more, Damian was struck speechless. But, before he could refute, the old man had agilely leapt over the counter and grabbed Leonel's shoulder. Leonel couldn't even react before he felt an undeniable strength take hold of his body.\n\"Your body is pretty good, Morales. Didn't expect that. Let's go.\"\nLike a little boat in a storm, Leonel could only helplessly disappear behind the counter, Hutch's hand latching onto his shoulder like a clamp.\nDamian, the catwoman, and the others watched on without knowing how to react.\n\"… Lieutenant, what just happened…?\"\nDamian cleared his throat. \"I hope that kid doesn't blame me. This really isn't my fault at all.\"\nDamian knew that Leonel didn't want to get tied up with the Slayer Legion, he only wanted to partner up with them for a moment. However, the attack of a Fort was too large of an operation. After all, there were only eight such structures on the Ascension Continent.\nIf Damian were to report such a campaign during the next check-in but be unable to provide a proper accounting for Leonel, it would lead to some problems.\nThink for a moment if there was a lieutenant who suddenly succeeded in something grand, but the members of his team were very obviously unable to accomplish such a thing alone. Wouldn't this raise suspicions? What if this was a scheme set up by the Empire to give one of their spies more merits?\nIn that case, Damian had no choice but to get Leonel properly vetted, or else instead of gaining from this expedition, he might lose out terribly instead and even be labeled as a potential traitor.\nLeonel understood this as well, which was why he didn't fight against coming here even though he knew it wasn't the safest choice. But, he could have never expected that he would be abducted by a madman in such a way. Why was he so unlucky?\nIf Hutch was a normal man, everything would be fine. It wouldn't be a big deal. But, a Supreme held a completely different connotation.\nThe 'Fleet' Hutch mentioned was the largest denomination within the Slayer Legion. Only a Supreme could head a Fleet and there were only four Fleets in the Legion. Being personally pulled into a Fleet like this was practically like dragging Leonel into quicksand.\nDamian could imagine how bitter Leonel would be. He went from only partnering with the Slayer Legion to suddenly being hounded by one of their highest ranking members.\nBut, there was another problem here. If Hutch was in this place, it meant that he should have long since retired. He didn't head a Fleet anymore, so how would he pull someone in?\nWho would have known that a day later, a certain bit of news would rock the Slayer Legion?\nSupreme Mighelle, after only ten years in the position, abdicated.\nThis alone would have been shocking enough had others not gossiped about seeing him walking out from his headquarters with swollen lips and a forehead several sizes larger than it had been just that morning.",

      "content": "Leonel sat blankly staring at a wall.\nIt had already been three days since he came to this checkpoint city, and he had stared at this wall for who knew how many hours, but his brain refused to wake up from this dream. How the hell had he gotten here?\n'How is that old man so powerful? I feel like I can't do anything to him…'\nLeonel felt quite helpless. He felt that that day the old man took him away, he had most definitely not used Force. Leonel's senses were too sharp to miss something like that. What was even more shocking, though, was the fact that the old man's stats were pushing 3.00. This is what truly left Leonel speechless.\nIf it was just this strength, it would be insane enough. But, what truly shocked Leonel about the old man was the sturdiness of his body. He was almost like the Metal Invalid Leonel met all those months ago. But, unlike that Invalid, his stats hadn't been tempered down by his own weight.\nAfter some thought, Leonel's mind drifted toward something in particular. When his father retired as a general, he had gone to work as a researcher. It was while in that position that he produced the vomit brew Leonel was forced to consume daily.\nTo this day, Leonel didn't know what the name of that department was. All he knew was that his father was involved in the evolution of human food and the consumption of it. The Ascension Empire had brought technology basically to its upper limits, so they wanted to test the limits of the human body.\nIf the Empire could run such tests, why couldn't the rebel army do so as well? If Hutch was part of these experiments and could be considered a success, then maybe the waters of Earth were far deeper than he thought.\nBut, if such was the case, then why was Hutch the first person he had seen with such ridiculous stats? If such a good thing existed, Leonel believed that the old man definitely wouldn't be the only one to benefit.\nFor example, the Governor Duke's son had stats that could barely be considered average among non-athletic humans even before the Metamorphosis. If the son of a Governor Duke wasn't allowed to partake in such benefits, how could others?\nOf course, there was the possibility that only the Slayer Legion had access to such technology. But, if that was the case… wouldn't the Empire have been taken down long ago? What could they do against a legion of super humans?\n'Maybe I'm just over thinking all of this. What if the rebels have someone amongst them like that monocle wearing prick? If someone awoke the abilities to alter their genetics, that could explain it too… But if that was the case, why would they choose an old man first?'\n\"Agghh.\"\nLeonel ruffled his hair with both had as though trying to hurry his brain to the answer. But, not unexpectedly, he failed.\nPENG!\nAt that moment, someone threw a kick at Leonel's door, sending it flying off the hinges… again.\n\"Time to train!\"\nLeonel's expression darkened. \"Old Hutch, I've already told you a million times, I have no intention of joining the Slayer Legion. If you keep treating me like this, the day you train me to be your better is the day I'll directly betray the Slayer Legion.\"\nIf other rebels knew that Leonel was speaking to Hacker Hutch like this, they would plop to the ground in fear for him. Who of the rebels dared to speak to this madman in this way? Wasn't that just asking for death?\n\"HAHAHA!\" Hutch laughed uproariously. \"Speak of that the day you defeat me. Otherwise, obediently listen to me, boy!\"\nLeonel felt helpless. Did this old man really think he couldn't defeat him? If Leonel activated his Force, his stats would also be pushing 3.00. If he used his Spear Domain Lineage Factor on top of that, defeating Hutch wouldn't be impossible.\nUnfortunately, this entire city hidden without a block of metal was covered in Force disrupting towers. And, secondly, even if it wasn't, Leonel would still feel hesitant. The spear was a killing weapon, after all. And, his Lineage Factor didn't seem to activate when he used blunt weapons. Though he was annoyed by the old man, he definitely didn't want to kill him.\nWhen Hutch first took him away, Leonel thought that he just wanted to talk more about football. But who knew that when this old man sensed how strong his body was when he resisted being pulled away that he would actually react so crazily?\nFirst, he stormed into Supreme Mighelle's Fleet headquarters and claimed that he would be taking over. When Supreme Mighelle obviously resisted, he beat him to the point he was black and blue.\nThen, he claimed a 'Promising Future' quota for Leonel, directly booting one of the youths who had previously held the position away in favor of him. It was suffice to say that this enraged a great many people, but Old Hutch was a madman that seemed to do whatever he wanted.\nEven after Leonel explained that he wanted nothing to do with that ranking, Old Hutch actually brought out a stick and started whacking him with it in the name of 'training'. No matter what logic Leonel used, the old man didn't seem to care in the slightest.\nLeonel's shoulder was clamped down once again and he once more let out a helpless sigh.\n\"Old Hutch, I'm definitely not participating in that Promise Tournament.\"\n\"You have no choice, Morales. Who asked you to now represent my face? Not only must you participate, you must get first place.\"\nLeonel almost couldn't refrain from rolling his eyes. Why did he say it like he asked for this? He most definitely didn't ask for this.\n\"I don't need your training to get first place even if I did participate.\" Leonel said, a bit annoyed. Who wouldn't be annoyed in his current condition? He was currently flying like a kite in the air because this damned old man was running too fast.\n\"Hohoho, you look like a good little prep boy, but I see right through you. You're actually so arrogant. If those other youngins heard you, you wouldn't even need me to enrage them. You'd do it by yourself.\n\"Hehe, good thing I recorded you.\"\nLeonel was left speechless once again before almost fainting in rage. But, the old man didn't seem to notice as he was once more dragged to the training grounds.",

      "content": "Old Hutch threw Leonel out when they reached the training ground. A normal person might have fallen and rolled a couple times, but Leonel was able to regain his bearing and land on his feet, a helpless expression in his eyes.\nThe old man walked to the side toward a rack of weapons. Well, one might call it a rack of weapons, but it was more accurate to call it a rack of machetes. This old man apparently didn't allow any other weapons to enter his sight.\nThe training ground was old and dilapidated. It was located in the basement of a place Leonel could only assume was Old Hutch's home. The ground was built of broken concrete, the ceilings were covered in half shattered light bulbs that probably hadn't appeared in a home since the 20th century, and there was a faint musty smell of sweat that hung in the air.\n\"Old Hutch, I've told you again and again that I have no interest in using a machete as my weapon. I use spears.\"\n\"Hmph, the machete is a man's weapon. I'll be damned if you're going to waste your talent.\" The old man snorted but then smiled. \"That said, if you show me a bit of your skill, I might change my mind.\"\nLeonel was exasperated. This back and forth conversation sounded like it was the first time they were having it, but the truth was that this had happened two times before already. However, Leonel was really reaching the end of his rope this time.\nThe more time he spent with this old man, the less adorable he thought he was and the more pissed off he got. The first few times, it might have been a funny story to tell in the future, but now it was becoming an annoyance that was ruining his future plans.\nAina was in who knows how much danger right now. Miles and Simeon were still sucking air and Leonel had no idea what plot the latter was potentially laying down. After all, he didn't believe that that gorilla-man had popped up out of thin air. And, Leonel still had no idea where his father was.\n\"Fine.\"\nLeonel's furious gaze calmed to the point of lacking ripples. His abrupt change caused Old Hutch to raise his brows. He had expected Leonel to react just the same as he had the previous two days, disdaining to fall for his taunts.\nOver the past two days, Leonel had completely ignored the old man, only casually brandishing a machete to get him off his back. But now, Leonel had reached the limit of his patience.\nWith a flip of his palm, a silver rod appeared in his hand. He stood tall, his tranquil gaze bearing down on the old man.\nOld Hutch looked toward the rod in curiosity. \"That's what you call a spear?\"\n\"I'd prefer not to kill an old man just seeking companionship.\" Leonel said indifferently.\nOld Hutch blinked before bursting into an uproarious laughter.\n\"Kill me? I knew it, I knew it. You really are an overconfident little brat —.\"\nThe old man might have wanted to say more, but Leonel had already moved. His body was lithe and flexible. Somehow, despite moving in a straight line, it felt as though he had cut off all paths of retreat.\n\"Oh?\" The curiosity of Old Hutch was suddenly piqued.\nWith a crooked grin, the old man stepped forward, swinging his machete down. It seemed like a casual movement, but Leonel could feel the weight of a mountain behind it. This old man… was strong.\nHowever, Leonel wasn't the same as he was just a few days ago. He had always felt that he was missing something when it came to imitating the primitive woman, but now, he knew what it was. It was flexibility.\nThough men had certain advantages when it came to martial arts, so too did women. The primitive woman especially seemed to move as though her bones were made of water and her flesh was carved of dew. That sort of flexibility was exactly what Leonel had been missing this hold time.\nHowever, flexibility wasn't something one could casually improve upon. It took years of consistency to reach such a point. And, even those who could boast great flexibility would show decline in their abilities if they slacked off.\nLuckily for Leonel, after forming his Two Star Constitution, his body had been remolded. In everything beside his size and strength, he was practically like a newborn baby, allowing him to lay an even better foundation of flexibility for himself.\nNot only did this allow him to break through to the Advanced Grade One designation, but it allowed him to imitate the movements of the primitive woman to a much greater degree.\nBANG!\nThe tip of Leonel's rod perfectly met the old man's blade edge. However, instead of rebounding off of each other, they seemed to become stuck, causing Leonel's eyes to widen.\nHe pulled his rod back, deftly dodging Old Hutch's follow up strike, but the result was the same.\nLeonel's brow furrowed, his gaze becoming more serious. This time, he no longer held back.\nA ran of piercing strikes came at the old man from all sides. Leonel's speed was inconceivable, fluttering around the old man as though his stamina was endless.\nHis rod fell like droplets of rain, blurring shadows of silver streaking across the room as he attacked the man from all angles.\nYet, no matter what he did, his rod always seemed to become stuck to Old Hutch's machete as though they were two parts destined to be fitted together.\nLeonel's gaze narrowed. He was shocked by the ability of this old man. Even relying on the skills of the primitive man and woman, he seemed completely unable to find an opportunity to break through his defenses.\nWith a flicker of his eyes, the rod in Leonel's hands vanished, only to be replaced by a true spear. His aura completely changed and the pressure bearing down on Old Hutch multiplied severalfold.\nThe old man couldn't help but blink in surprise. In a moment, his casual appearance became serious as his feet finally began to shift.\nAs Leonel's blood boiled, his power seemed to multiply. He was completely immersed in the feeling, he could almost smell the old man's defeat.\nHis heart yearned for it. He wanted nothing more than victory.\nIt was maybe only at this moment that it became clear that it wasn't that Leonel didn't have any ambition, but rather that he only had this simple wish. To always win. Nothing else mattered.\nSeeing the look in Leonel's eye, despite the pressure on him, the old man grinned.\n'What a good kid… Unfortunately, you're still several decades too young to think of defeating me.\"\nSuddenly, the man's aura changed as well. Though it was just the faintest of light, Leonel's senses were too sharp to miss the slight glow that coated the old man's blade.\nSSSHUUUUUU\nThe machete's edge perfectly met the tip of Leonel's spear. The spear's prism-like tip stopped in the air for but a moment before it was split. In fact, the machete continued down and would have chopped Leonel's hand off had Old Hutch not shown mercy.\nLeonel's steps paused, looking at his ruined spear with a shocked gaze. His breath hung heavily in the air as his chest heaved. It was only now that he realized he had been battling the old man for a few hours and was exhausted. But, he didn't have a mind to think of that.\n\"Force… That was definitely Force… But it was different at the same time… Blade Force…?\"",

      "content": "Leonel was astonished. This Force could be used beneath the disruption of the towers?\nHe didn't know much about Force Strengthening Deviations, nor had he ever seen one. But, he was quite certain that what he had just seen was Blade Force.\nLeonel's father had said that there were certain things about the Spear Domain heirloom that he wasn't allowed to know until he grasped Spear Force, but even to this day, he had still not yet grasped it. Who would have known that this damned old man would have long since comprehended it?\nAt this point, Leonel came to another understanding. The old man's strength wasn't because of an ability or because of some special food. The reason his body was so strong was precisely due to his Blade Force.\nFrom Leonel's minor understanding, Force Strengthening Deviations weren't as simple as just making one's weapon more powerful.\nFirst of all, not all of them were related to weapons. And, secondly, even those that were could grow and nurture the body, strengthening it over time.\nThe old man must have comprehended Blade Force a very long time ago, likely even before the Metamorphosis, allowing his body to be much stronger than others. In this case, his strength made much more sense.\nWhen a Force Strengthening Deviation was comprehended, it would take form in the Ethereal Glabella, exactly like Leonel's Stars. In fact, the Stars in Leonel's Ethereal Glabella could be classified as Force Strengthening Deviations as well. It was just that whereas Spear Force would make a spear's attack more potent, the Stars in Leonel's mind nurtured his spirit and quickened his recovery of it!\nHearing Leonel's words, Old Hutch was stunned before he broke out into laughter.\n\"So you know about Blade Force, little brat? Not bad, not bad. I have indeed comprehended Blade Force. I was 42 years old back then, now I'm almost 150.\"\nLeonel felt a bit numb when he heard this. Though technology had extended life expectancy, from the 21st century to the 25th, a normal lifespan only went from 80 years to about 120. However, he had never heard of a 150 year old man capable of jumping around like a spry monkey.\nAt the same time, Leonel finally felt a heartfelt respect for the old man. Comprehending Force related abilities back when Earth was still a Third Dimensional world was difficult beyond imagining. This old man's talent in blade arts was most definitely outstanding.\n\"Old Hutch, teach me how to comprehend Spear Force and I'll participate in the tournament for you.\"\nLeonel's pale green eyes shone brightly. For a moment, they were like lanterns in the dull light of the basement, boring holes into the old man's body.\nHowever, instead of receiving the answer he thought he would, Leonel saw Hutch frown for the first time in the three days he had known him.\n\"Morales, do you think comprehending Blade Force is a joke? I thought before, when you were insisting on using the spear, that you had some lingering attachments to it. This is why I was willing to let you show me your talent. But, from what I see, you have no real attachments to the spear at all, you didn't even react when I destroyed your weapon. How could you possibly comprehend Spear Force with your current mindset? How could you gain the acknowledgment of a weapon if you don't love it?\"\n\"Love it?\" Leonel's expression changed.\nDid he love the spear? The simple answer was no. It was a weapon he randomly picked up only because it was convenient. He had snatched it from a small gang who dared to speak inappropriately of his Aina. After that, he just so happened to learn that he had a spear related Lineage Factor, so he stuck with the spear. It wasn't more complicated than this for him.\nBut even setting this aside, Leonel couldn't understand why it was that the old man said he had to love his spear to comprehend Spear Force. None of this made any sense. He couldn't find a logical reason for why love would be necessary to the equation.\nIf it was about this, then didn't that mean Leonel would never comprehend Spear Force? It wasn't like he could fake his love for a weapon right? If he learned that he had a sword, or machete, or bow and arrow Lineage Factor right now, he wouldn't hesitate to leave the Spear behind.\nTo him, the spear was just a tool. Why was there a need to love it?\nSeeing Leonel's changing expression, the old man shook his head. If it was so easy to pass on comprehensions like this, nothing in the world would be difficult.\nAfter a moment, Leonel took a deep breath.\n\"Old Hutch, show me your Blade Force just one more time.\"\nLeonel's mind was difficult for others to understand. He was a kind soul, but he was equally as cold and calculating. He had a soft heart, but he couldn't stand losing. He was capable of feeling pity that his spear was now destroyed… but he couldn't feel that heartbroken emotion Old Hutch expected from him.\nOld Hutch's initial instinct was to reject, but after seeing Leonel's staunch gaze, he sighed.\n\"Fine, fine. I will show you once more. Consider it repayment for kidnapping you.\"\n'Oh, so you're aware that you kidnapped me too, huh?'\nThough he said this, Leonel still felt a sense of loss. He could see that Old Hutch had lost interest in him after seeing him exert his spearmanship. It wasn't because he wasn't talented enough or because he wasn't skilled enough, it was rather because he didn't care about the weapon in his hand.\nAt such thoughts, Leonel could only shrug. He couldn't force himself to have emotions he didn't have. But, that lit a fire in his heart nonetheless.\nHe had to love his weapon to comprehend Spear Force? Bullshit. He would show this damned old man who had been annoying him all this time that he needed no such thing.\nA vast, boundless aura shrouded the basement room as Leonel focused his entire being on the machete in Old Hutch's hands. He didn't even notice that Hutch's eyes flickered with killing intent he quickly suppressed.\n'This damned brat, if I didn't stop myself in time, his aura would have made me lash out to kill him. I thought I was on the battlefield meeting a formidable opponent for a second…' Old Hutch shook his head. '… Still, you have so much talent yet you're wasting it. You place so many things below your vision, so you hardly care about anything at all. I want to teach you a lesson, but I'm afraid that our Slayer Legion really doesn't have many at your age who can defeat you.\n'But, I won't bring those brats out. If I did, they would at most be able to match you. By then, you would think that maybe the road you're on is fine, when the reality is that you should be far better than them. You're hampering your own progress…\n'In that case, I'll allow you to despair for a bit. Without humbling yourself, reaching the pinnacle is impossible.'\nA violent surge of wind whipped around the training grounds, leaving Leonel in a trance.",

      "content": "On that day, the Southern Lookout was in an uproar. It might have even been more accurate to say that a tempest of rage had swept over it, stifling them to the point that they couldn't wait to vent their anger on somebody.\nOne might think that this rage was due to some actions the Empire took against them. After all, this was the mighty Slayer Legion. They were an organization created for the sake of taking down the behemoth that ruled Earth. Who else could enrage them so much if not their sworn enemy?\n??\nBut, reality was cruel and usually very far from expectations. This time around, the entity that had enraged them wasn't the mighty Empire at all, but rather a little boy of barely 18 years old. In fact, this boy had only joined them for all of three days, yet managed to claim all of their ire.\nFirst, it was said that he was taken under the wing of Hacker Hutch, the very man who smacked the face of Supreme Mighelle in public.\nIf it was only this, maybe the young man could dodge the guilt by association label, however, what came next was even worse. A recording of the young man saying that he could rank first among the Promising Youths even with Hacker Hutch's training was released, leaving the young men and women of the Slayer Legion fuming.\nAs though that wasn't enough, just today, the young man's alias was finally released.\nEveryone knew that all those who could list on the 'Promising Future' rankings were all youths with great potential that had caught the eye of various higher ups.\nThe truth was that not everyone could appear on the list just because they wanted to. If one wanted to have their progress tracked and their feats seen by all, it was necessary to gain the acknowledgment of an official of at least the Commander rank, a step above Joseph.\nOnly upon receiving this recommendation would others start paying attention to you. In addition, your name would appear at the bottom of the Promising Future rankings.\nIn order to protect these youths, aliases were chosen. In addition, whenever appearing in public, each of these youths would wear specialized masks created by the Research and Technology units of the Slayer Legion.\nThe name one chose was incredibly important. After all, it would follow them for a lifetime. Choosing a name was akin to branding yourself.\nHowever… Who could have imagined that that arrogant prick would choose the name: 'Indomitable'.\nCompared to the other names on the rankings that were usually formed of word couplets or poetic sayings, the singular word at the very bottom stood out to everyone. When this was coupled with the news they had been receiving over the last few days, it was easy to guess what the public opinion toward the young man 'Indomitable' was.\nAs for the man in question, Leonel himself, he would likely want to cry tears if he was aware. But, the truth of the matter was that he wasn't. As for the name? Of course he wasn't the one who chose it. In fact, he wasn't even aware of what was happening. He was completely engrossed in his spear.\nOne would think that if he was practicing, he would be testing out his movements, maybe redoing the same attack again and again. But, Leonel was actually frozen in place.\nEver since Old Hutch performed the last move, Leonel hadn't moved a single inch. He stood there, staring into space.\nHis actions caused the old man to sigh and shake his head. Sometimes, the old wanted to pass on their wisdom to the young, but would the young always listen? Unfortunately, there were some things in life that could only be learned through trial, error and continuous failure.\nHe believed that Leonel's attempts were foolish and had even told the little brat as much, but Leonel obviously wasn't listening.\nWhat he wasn't aware of, though, was that in his mind, Leonel was replaying his long battle with the old man over and over again. Then, he would replay his final demonstration of Blade Force before cycling it all back to the beginning again.\nLeonel didn't believe it. Everything he had learned about Force was so logical up until now. Even the energy itself was rooted in concepts of quantum physics. He didn't believe that something like Blade or Spear Force suddenly became so arbitrary.\nUnlike what the old man was thinking, Leonel didn't actually disregard his words. In fact, Leonel believed that the old man wasn't lying to him. Or, at the very least, he believed he wasn't lying. And, this thought alone was enough for Leonel.\nWhat was it? What was it that a veteran like Old Hutch could confuse for such an arbitrary feeling? What could trick him to such an extent?\n'Love… That wasn't what he was talking about… He meant unconditional love… That's the kind of feeling he has for his machete.'\nIt was a small difference in wording, but the moment Leonel had the thought, his eyes shone like two stars.\n'Unconditional love… unconditional love… The root of unconditional love is unconditional trust, it's based in instinct. A mother or father loves their child simply because the baby is theirs. On the surface, it seems no more complicated than this. However, this 'instinct' is still rooted in logic. It's the will to see their offspring grow, to continue their bloodline, to not have their families come to an end by their hands… to continue to leave their mark on history…'\nThe light in Leonel's eyes grew brighter and brighter. At one point, they became like burning torches, the paleness of his eyes disappearing to give way to two flashing emerald gems that could light the night sky.\nLeonel felt like he understood something.\nWhat Old Hutch thought of as 'unconditional love' was just an unconscious reliance on his own talent for blade arts. He trusted his own talent to the point it could be described as instinctual, as a part of himself. This trust, this love, this unconditional love, and further, this unconditional trust, is what allowed him to comprehend Blade Force in such a poor environment.\nLeonel, too, could rely on this unconditional love. If he fell back and stopped trying to find logical reasonings at every corner, he could have relied on his Lineage Factor to comprehend Spear Force no differently than Hutch relied on his talent. In fact, by now, Leonel's Spear Force could have long since surpassed Hutch's Blade Force by leaps and bounds. All he had to do was have that same unconditional trust in his own talent, to blindly follow it and allow it to lead the way...\nBut this wasn't the kind of person Leonel was. He didn't like the feeling of being led by the nose, even if it was his own bloodline. He liked to understand the root of things, to comprehend them to the point of making them his own.\nBy now, Leonel understood. The reason his Lineage Factor had had such a small effect on him to this point was because he wasn't trusting it as much as he should. He didn't have the blind faith in it someone else would have… At the same time, it made sense why his father had left so little about Spear Force in the dictionary. There was no need to explain Spear Force because Leonel's Lineage Factor should have told him about everything he needed to know!\nThis 'love' Hutch spoke about wasn't his path. He could rely on his Lineage Factor, but he didn't want to. He wanted to comprehend his Lineage Factor, to unveil all of its secrets and allow it to lay bare before him. Rather than relying on instinct, he wanted to rely on logic, on reasoning…\nIt might have sounded very fancy, but it boiled down to one point.\nHe wanted to win. He wanted to be Indomitable.",

      "content": "On this day, the Southern Lookout was bustling. Actually, it could be said that the past week was easily the liveliest time of the year. Not only was it the time for the agreed upon biannual check-in, but it was also the time for the gathering of Promising Youths.\nMany saw the check-in at the Lookouts to be a small vacation from the days of putting their lives on the line. It could be said that this gathering acted as the main attraction, placing a nice bow on the events of the last week.\n??\nAt this time, many had come together toward the center of the Venice-like city, ready to enjoy all the excitement.\nThe arena at the center of the Southern Lookout was quite beautiful indeed. It seated about 10 000 people normally, but this only counted the seats available directly on the property.\nTo the sides of the arenas, there were many artificial rivers of water that allowed boats to float around. If the seating capacity of these various steel behemoths was taken into account, the number of spectators could easily reach 50 000.\nThough this number of individuals might not necessarily come out to watch usually, the events of the past week were too shocking. How could any of them bear to miss this event? As a result, let alone 50 000 people, there were even more trying to push their way in.\nThose with special water based abilities were making quite a sum of money today, just taking in these people to have a look.\nAs for who these people had come for? Who else if not that young man known as Indomitable?\nOn the arena stage, there were already several masked young men and women who stood silently. Their posture could be considered perfect and each of them had the bearing of a military man or woman. Their discipline was immaculate.\nEach of their masks held a different symbol that represented their title. One might have pictured a roaring lion, another might have a slithering snake, some had images more abstract painted on theirs, while yet some others were completely straight forward and opted for words.\nThere were about 40 youths present. The actual number of Promising Youths assigned to the Southern Lookout was easily double this. However, not every youth on the ranking would come forward. After all, this was an organization created for the sake of taking down the Empire, not all of them had the time to spare out of their dangerous daily lives to take part.\nUsually, barely 20 would appear to put on a good show for the masses. But this time, double that number had come, and for obvious reasons at that.\n\"These kids are quite anxious it seems. To think that they didn't come out when we provided such good rewards, but are eager to now just because a little boy said a few words.\"\nA group of three stood in an overseer's box, looking toward the arena. Amongst them, there were two men and a single woman. Though they seemed smiling and reserved, it was obvious by the fact they had been chosen to oversee this battle that they were at the Commander rank at a bare minimum.\n\"It can't be helped.\" The woman replied. \"They all have seniors that give them treasures like the ones we reward all the time. Plus, even though they're young, they understand the concept of protecting themselves. The less famous they are, the better it is for them. Stepping forward for short term benefits is unwise.\"\n\"You say this like we're the bad guys for trying to give them a little incentive.\"\n\"I do find the whole rankings to be a bit silly. Why did we create them at all? You know that I was among the few who directly rejected the idea. We should be protecting these youths, not thrusting them into the spotlight like this.\"\nThe woman clearly didn't like the proceedings. This was only the third gathering to ever take place. After all, the Promising rankings were only created after the Metamorphosis. It was widely known that youths had greater potential during this evolutionary stage, so emphasis was placed on them.\nRegardless, this woman felt that this was only more reason to stop this practice, but it was too difficult to go against the tide.\nOne of them men sighed. \"Violet Rain, the higher ups have their own concerns as well. Earth's situation is quite precarious right now, not everything is as it seems on the surface.\"\nHearing these words, the woman fell silent. She too knew that the behind-the-scenes matters weren't so simple. But, even if there were logical reasons, she still found it to be a difficult pill to swallow.\nAn event like today was exactly what she had been worried about. No matter how sensible they were, the young was still the young, after all. They were only provoked just this little bit and look at how many of them had come out this time. In fact, if it wasn't for the fact the rise of 'Indomitable' was too sudden, she was certain that even more would have come. Maybe all over 100 Promising Youths would have come this time had Leonel appeared just a little earlier.\nThough she didn't share this with anyone, the vigilance in her heart was raised by several levels. Who knew if this was a ploy by the Empire to learn more about the future pillars of the Slayer Legion?\nThe reason she didn't dare to voice such concerns was precisely because of Hacker Hutch. Since Indomitable was tied to Hacker Hutch, it could be said that he was endorsed by the latter as well. Not many would believe that such a legend had betrayed them.\nBut, wasn't it exactly because of this that the plan would be so perfect? After all, it wasn't like retired officials of their Legion hadn't become disillusioned to the point of defecting in the past… The path they as rebels walked was too perilous.\n\"Yes, yes, yes. I know I how you feel. Well, today you might just get to see that kid you hate so much get his just desserts. Look up there, two in the top five actually remained behind.\"\nThe man pointed toward two young people, one of which was a young man and the other of which was a young woman.\nThe young woman wore a tight fitting green tracksuit. The leggings clung close to her toned legs and her jacket was half unzipped, revealing a sports bra that held back her breasts. Though her chest couldn't be said to be large, it was still eye catching, causing a few youths to look over and gulp down every so often.\nHowever, after seeing the green, spiraling swirls painted onto the young woman's mask, none of them dared to harass her. They knew immediately that this was the new third ranked on the Promising Future list, 'Chasing Wind'.\nThe young man stood a few columns away from her, his back as straight as a javelin. His full, sturdy chest jutted out like two blocks of stone, pushing against his simple white shirt as he clasped his hands behind his back.\nHis mask was covered in the image of a dark cloud. Everyone knew who he was by this symbol. He was the youth who had just been pushed down a spot by 'Chasing Wind', 'Thunderous Clap'!\nHowever, though these two were here and had even looked around on several occasions, they only saw masks with symbols they recognized. The man named Indomitable was nowhere to be seen.\n'Could it be that he would provoke them into coming like this then dodge responsibility himself? If so, this plot is too sinister…' An ugly expression twisted the image of the beautiful woman in the overseer box.\nBut, at that moment, a hysterical laughter cut through the chatting voices of the crowd waiting for a show.\n\"Old Hutch, let me go dammit! I was so close!\"\n\"Shut up, brat. You said that you would participate if I showed you my Blade Force one more time. Do you think I would let you miss this gathering? Dream on!\"\nA young man was sent tumbling into the arena, entering in as sorry of a state as one could imagine.\nHe huffed a sigh and stood after his body stopped rolling, sending a glare toward the old man who had crossed water to bring him here.\n'Force can be used to walk on water? So cool.'\nDespite his glare, the young man was actually quite intrigued.\nFinally, seemingly noticing that this situation wasn't quite right, the young man looked up to find over 40 burning gazes looking toward him.\nThe young man raised an eyebrow. 'Why do they all look like they want to eat me alive?'\nWho else could this young man be if not Leonel?",

      "content": "The gazes of over 40 youths fell onto Leonel. When they saw that his mask had no markings on it at all, they immediately guessed that this man should be the so-called Indomitable.\nAs for Leonel, he was as confused as ever. What had he done to attract such hatred?\n??\n'Is it because I was late…?'\nLeonel felt a wave of fatigue hit him all of a sudden. It was only now that he remembered he hadn't slept in almost five days. He had been diligently comprehending something when the old man suddenly appeared, grabbed his shoulder, then tossed him here.\nIf it wasn't for his high spirit, staying awake for so long would be impossible even if his body was many times more powerful. Unfortunately, his spirit had taken quite a bit of a hit now.\n\"Sorry, I was late.\"\nThese were the first words Leonel said, but they only made the gazes of the over 40 youths that looked toward Leonel burn brighter. This wasn't only because of what he said, but also because they recognized his voice. It was the very same voice that said it could defeat them all even without Hacker Hutch's training.\nAs for Leonel's words themselves, how could they take it seriously? In fact, they found it to be quite insulting. If his words didn't imply disregard, then what else could they imply?\nThey had all gotten here early, all to teach Indomitable a lesson. Yet, not only did he not appear on time, making them wait for him, but they had all just heard his voice clearly. Even to this point, he still hadn't wanted to come. Had it not been for Old Hutch, he might have not come at all. How could they not feel unsatisfied?\nSeeing the atmosphere wasn't quite right, Leonel smiled bitterly and scratched the back of his head. But, at that moment, a yawn inadvertently came from his mouth, causing him to subconsciously cover his lips despite having a mask on. It couldn't be helped, he was too tired.\nHowever, what he had forgotten was that since he was wearing a mask, no one could see his sheepish grin. But, they all very clearly heard his yawn. This made their already furious gazes spit fire.\nAt this point, even if Leonel wanted to explain, no one would listen.\nThe sound of a throat clearing rang over the arena.\n\"Indomitable, I presume? Please take your place on the arena and we can begin.\"\nLeonel turned his head back toward the overseer box, seeing that the voice came from there, then complied. It seemed he really wouldn't be able to get out of this. He was usually well-liked wherever he went. This could be said to be the first time in his life where he was truly public enemy number one for reasons that were completely out of his control.\nThough Leonel complied with the voice, his every action was under the scrutiny of too many people. His appearance in comparison to the perfect military form of the other youths on the stage with him stuck out like a sore thumb. It was clear that whether it was his posture or demeanor, he was lacking completely. He threw their perfect formation into disarray.\nHis steps weren't even, his back was slouched, and his eyes were perpetually half closed.\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, he kept yawning.\nThe flickers of deep disdain and disgust continuously came his way, but by this point, Leonel didn't have the mind to care for them. He had fallen into a trance once more, seemingly trying to grasp something that had just been within his reach.\nOver the last several days, he had been trying to comprehend his Lineage Factor and by extension Spear Force, but he had ended up stumbling upon something completely different. It left him quite shocked, actually. In truth, he had almost completely forgotten about his infatuation with Spear Force.\nUnfortunately, his absentminded gaze and his continuous yawning not only made him the public enemy of the youths, but also the crowd watching on. They hardly even paid attention to the Commanders who were in charge of reading out the rules of the gathering.\nThe more they paid attention to Leonel, the more he didn't seem to notice them, and the more enraged they became. Then, when they reached a tipping point, Leonel would yawn again, making veins bulge like slithering snakes on their foreheads.\n\"… The first will be Indomitable, I assume you don't mind?\"\nAt first, Leonel didn't register the words. After all, he didn't know his name was Indomitable now. He wasn't the one who chose the name.\nBut, after a moment, he seemed to recall that the woman who spoke from the overseer's box earlier had also said Indomitable when referring to him. He hadn't thought much about it because his mind was too sluggish to care for other things. But now, he suddenly made the connection.\n\"Who, me?\" Leonel looked up, only to find several more glares aimed toward him. \"Sure, sure. Yes, yes.\"\nHe hurriedly spoke. He had no idea what was going on, but he thought his best option was to agree, or else these people might really pounce on him.\nThe woman in the overseer's box frowned. She had already had a poor impression of Leonel from the beginning, but his actions since coming here infuriated even her.\nUnder Leonel's confused gaze, the other youths who had shared the stage with him cleared out and left, not forgetting to send a few more threatening gazes toward him. Toward this, he could only be helpless.\n'Am I supposed to leave too, or?'\nLeonel hesitated. He was apparently supposed to go first, but he didn't know what he was supposed to do. Luckily, he got an answer quite quickly.\nThe ground separated to reveal a hidden underground passageway. Others couldn't see what was going on with just their eyes, but even with his weakened spirit, Leonel could tell that there was a small group of Invalids coming toward him now, all of which were at the A-grade. He could see that there were a total of five of them.\n'Am I supposed to defeat them?'\nLeonel came to an understanding, then. Since that was the case, everything was pretty straight forward then. In truth, Leonel's mind was groggy, all he really wanted to do was sleep, but whenever he had such thoughts, his curiosity got the best of him and he continued to study that weird feeling he grasped just a few days ago.\nNow that his mind had cleared once more due to this tournament and he didn't have that curiosity to distract him from his fatigue anymore, all he wanted to do was take a nap.\nThe five A-grade Invalids stalked their way up from the hidden underground passage. The crowd had been quite interested in seeing all of their weird mutations and quirks. After all, there was a high chance that Invalids at the A-grade would have such oddities attached to them. But, they didn't get much of a chance.\nWith a flip of his hand, an atlatl appeared in Leonel's palm. With his increase in strength after forming a Two Star Constitution, defeating A-grade Invalids was as easy as a flick of wrist.\nFive streaks of silver pierced through the air, leaving howling winds in their wake. A moment later, they shot through five foreheads, blasting the A-grade Invalids apart only for them to turn into several motes of light.\nSeeing that the task was done, Leonel couldn't refrain from yawning again. He went off to the side to find a place to rest. He didn't seem to notice the silence of the arena when he sat back down. In fact, he had just been feeling tired a moment ago, but instead of closing his eyes, he actually sank back into that absentminded head space.\nA light of fury flickered in the female Commander's eyes.\n\"Indomitable is disqualified for breaking the rules.\"\nUnfortunately for her sanity, Leonel didn't seem to hear this either.",

      "content": "Leonel really hadn't heard this voice at all. In fact, his eyes were still vacant. The only thing that made it seem that he was awake was his occasional yawn. Still, it was as though the outside world had nothing to do with him.\nA rain of 'BOO's' came from the crowd. Clearly, they had been infuriated beyond reason. It was only after their rage became like a tempest that Leonel was startled awake and looked around in confusion.\n??\n'Why the hell are they booing?'\nLeonel looked up toward the overseer's box, thinking that he might find a clue. But, all he saw was a woman looking toward him with an infuriated gaze while the two men beside him had helpless expressions. This only made him more confused.\n\"What happened…?\"\nLeonel mumbled these words to himself, but the youths who were near by him heard them and couldn't take it anymore.\n\"You're still saying bullshit like that at this point?! You're disqualified! If you were going to throw the gathering like this from the beginning, why the hell did you waste all of our times?!\"\nThe young man who spoke wore a mask painted with a fierce roaring lion. It was just that this lion, instead of having a brownish gold mane, was completely black. Someone more? knowledgeable than Leonel would immediately recognize this young man as 'Roaring Black Lion'.\nNo one knew whether the name was chosen for this reason or not, but the young man did happen to be black. What wasn't covered by his mask or his clothes revealed dark skin with pulsing muscles beneath. He was a bit shorter than 'Thunderous Clap', but he was definitely stockier.\n\"Disqualified?\" Leonel blinked in confusion. \"I broke the rules? What rule did I break?\"\nAt this point, Leonel felt a little bad. He hadn't been paying attention when the female Commander was listing the rules, so he didn't know what they were at all. Without knowing, he could only apologize. How could he refute if he didn't know what he was refuting?\nLeonel assumed that maybe he wasn't allowed to use weapons. If that was the case, he could only take this on the chin. He had only wanted to end his turn as quickly as possible so that he could rest, but it actually came back to bite him like this.\nRoaring Black Lion frowned when he heard Leonel's words. This was about the last question he had expected to hear. He, along with everyone else, assumed that Leonel had gotten himself disqualified on purpose.\n\"Treasures gained with Zones are banned for this gathering. In order to maintain fairness, we can only choose weapons from the racks to the side.\"\n\"Oh…\" Leonel mumbled. \"… That's unfortunate. Sorry about that, I must have missed it.\"\nDid that mean he got to go? This wasn't a bad result. After all, he had fulfilled his promise to the old man by coming here.\nRoaring Black Lion's lip twitched. Could it be that this young man really hadn't heard anything? He could only look on as Leonel stood and slowly walked toward the exit of the arena with an absentminded gaze. He didn't seem to hear the torrent of boos raining down on him.\nIf it was up to Leonel, as long as he participated in something, he would have liked to take first. However, he also wasn't the type of person who despaired in his failure either, not to mention the fact his mind was completely preoccupied by something else.\nUnfortunately for Leonel's thoughts of rest, would the madman Hutch really allow him off so easily?\n\"Hey, little girl, directly allow this brat into the next round.\"\nThe three Commanders in the overseer's box was suddenly stunned by the presence of a fourth person. Regardless of which of them it was, they had no idea when someone had appeared in their midst.\nThe woman was the first to recover from her shock and register the old man's words.\nHer expression flickered several times. No matter what thoughts she held close to her heart, she didn't dare to be disrespectful to Hacker Hutch. However, how could she go back on her word. She had just listed the rules and Leonel blatantly disregarded them. Now she was supposed to reinstate him? How could she do something like that?\nTaking a deep breath, the woman gathered up her resolve.\n\"Commander Violet Rain greets Supreme Hutch.\" Violet Rain saluted seriously. \"I cannot comply with Supreme's orders, Indomitable has broken the rules. We cannot cause the integrity of the gathering to suffer.\"\nThe two men by Brigit had weird expressions upon hearing this. Wasn't she disparaging the gathering just a few minutes ago? When had it become so important to her?\n\"This is an order.\" Hutch said without a care, finding a couch to lie on and plopping down.\nIt was unknown where he got it, but he had carried a large pizza in with him and started munching away without a care in the world.\nFury lit Violet Rain's eyes. This was… so unreasonable!\nYes, it was unreasonable. But, so what? These were Hutch's thoughts.\nAny army had a strict hierarchy. This was even more so for a rebel army like the Slayer Legion. The consequences for disobeying an official just one rank above was already steep, let alone someone three ranks above her like Hutch.\nViolet Rain's chest billowed with the waves of her anger. But, what could she do? Other than her face reddening and her ears almost jetting out steam, there wasn't anything else.\nBy this point, the audience below felt that the situation was getting weird. Leonel was already almost out of the arena and it had already been several minutes since his turn ended. Why was it that the overseer's box hadn't said anything about which of the Promising Youths was next?\nAt that point, the forceful clearing of a throat could be heard over the arena. In truth, though it was as such, one could almost mistake it for the sounds of a dying cat. Who knew what kind of internal struggle the person who made the sound was undergoing?\n\"The… previous decision has been revoked.\" A female voice spoke through gritted teeth. \"… Indomitable will directly move on to the next round.\"\nAfter a moment of silence, the arena erupted. Gazes of indignation and fury fell on a particular young man and the overseer's box.\n\"This is bullshit!\"\n\"Just because he's the underling of a Supreme?! Rules don't matter anymore?!\"\nAt this point, the loudest voices were the youths near the stage. Their roars called out toward the overseer's box like a raging typhoon.\nIf Leonel was already hated before, it could be said that maybe only the Emperor of the Ascension Empire was a greater enemy to them all now. And, even then, it was close.",

      "content": "Leonel kept walking in his absentminded state. He really hadn't heard the words of Commander Violet Rain at all. He was immersed in his own world. In fact, he might have walked all the way out of the arena had he not suddenly felt that someone was standing in front of him.\n\"Hm?\"\n??\nLeonel frowned and looked up.\nIt was accurate to say that Leonel was quite tall. In fact, since his academy days, he had grown another inch or so. Now, he stood at 6'4. So, despite the fact the young man standing before him had quite an overbearing aura, Leonel, upon looking up, even despite his slouched back, stood taller.\nSeeing this, the young man narrowed his eyes, but his momentum didn't dampen in the slightest.\nWhen the crowd saw this young man confronting Leonel, their eyes blazed with passion. The rolling clouds painted over the young man's mask made his identity clear. They couldn't help but feel their blood boil, hoping that the young man would redress their grievances.\n\"Is there a problem?\" Leonel asked.\n\"I only want to let you know one thing.\"\nThe man's voice was like a thunderous boom. He didn't seem to be trying to speak loudly, but his voice naturally projected as though he was a man perfectly suited to lead.\nLeonel's first instinct was to think that this young man had a voice related ability like Admiral Millan. However, Leonel's senses were far sharper than they had been in the past. He could even vaguely get a sense of a person's ability as long as they tapped into it, though not nearly as thoroughly as the dictionary. But, this was still a good thing. After all, he couldn't always speak to the dictionary out loud and letting others know about its existence might not be a good thing.\nThis was all to say that Leonel felt that this young man's ability might not be so simple.\n\"One thing?\" Leonel asked in confusion.\n\"I hope that you'll get yourself disqualified for the second round as well. Or else, if we meet on that stage, I'll make sure you leave on a stretcher.\"\nLeonel was stunned.\nIn his life, this was the first time he had come across such a situation. After all, he lived in a society with rules and regulations. Maybe only when Conrad tried to kill James by throwing him out of a window did Leonel vaguely come across such a thing. But this was most definitely the first time someone had so blatantly said something like this to him. How could he not be left speechless for a moment?\nFor a while, Leonel didn't seem to hear or feel anything. By the time the crowd's noise faded back into existence for him, the boos had become cheers. It was obvious they had heard the young man's words.\n\"Thunderous Clap, you're my idol!\"\n\"Teach him a lesson!\"\nLeonel came back to reality, realizing that this wasn't a dream. Is this the kind of place Earth had become now? People could just blatantly threaten another and even gain the cheers of a crowd as a result?\nSomething within Leonel seemed to change at that moment. It wasn't anything large. In fact, he could summarize it just a single word: acceptance.\nIf this was the world he lived in now, maybe that was fine too.\n\"So there's a round two?\" Leonel mumbled to himself. \"I guess I was only disqualified for the first round then…\"\n\"If you're scared, then scram!\"\n\"Look at him, he didn't even dare to move after Thunderous Clap put him in his place. Maybe he'll leave the arena directly!\"\nLeonel mumbled to himself. But, by now, Thunderous Clap had already walked away under a chorus of cheers. The crowd might very well have taken Leonel's pause as a sign of fear, but the truth was that Leonel had already returned to his own world.\nWhat a joke. Who was he? He was the greatest quarterback prospect in easily the last several generations. How many games had he played in enemy territory? Let alone these insults, he had heard ten, even a hundred, times worse. He had learned to tune it out a long time ago.\nBut, what the crowd missed in all those jeers was that the moment Leonel's heart settled down, blinding, flickering lights jumped within his eyes. Unlike in the past, these lights were real. It was to the point that if one had met Leonel's gaze now, they might even be blinded for a moment. Thunderous Clap's words had unlocked something within him.\nLeonel turned and walked back to his seat.\nHe had no idea that the rules had been broken for him. In his mind, he had failed in the first round but received a chance at the second. In that case, he would sit and wait for his turn. He had no idea that he had gone from the coward who couldn't respond to Thunderous Clap, to the shameless young man who threw the face of all Promising Youths.\n\"… Next, Thunderous Clap.\"\nCommander Violet Rain's voice seemed to be far more at ease now. It was obvious to most the Thunderous Clap had vented some of her rage for her, and in the coming round, if this 'Indomitable' wasn't sensible, then she just might get to see a great show.\nShe looked toward Hutch with a half satisfied expression, but who would have known that old man wouldn't even be paying attention? In fact, he was still nibbling away at his pizza without a care in the world.\nAt that moment, Thunderous Clap stood and walked to the stage. The ground opened up to reveal five more Invalids.\nHe sunk into a horse stance, his fists clasping against the sides of his body.\n\"Thunderous Clap isn't using his rod!\"\n\"He's making a point, obviously. Some shameless people only know how to cheat with the fancy weapons they get through nepotism.\"\n\"Haha! Show him who's truly 'Indomitable'! Even without your weapon, you're his better!\"\nThunderous Clap's eyes flashed as a low shout like his lips.\nThe stage beneath his feet quaked and cracked as he shot forward, appearing before the first Invalid in the blink of an eye.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nHis body was like the center of a storm. Violent vibrations and cacophonic booms seemed to follow his every movement, leaving destruction in his wake.\nHe passed through the group of Invalids in a flash.\nFor a moment, it seemed like nothing had happened, even when Thunderous Clap smoothed out the wrinkles of his clothes and everything fell into silence. But, in the next instant…\nBANG!\nThe five Invalids combusted. It was as though someone had planted a bomb within their bodies, allowing them to explode from the inside out.\nThe motes of light they became shot into the air under the pressure before slowly descending back toward Thunderous Clap. This sight alone made him look as though he was a favored child, basking in the rays of the skies.\nThe atmosphere reached the peak. Thunderous Clap's performance caused the arena to erupt to the point the ground shook.",

      "content": "The crowd went wild, basking Thunderous Clap with praise. At this point, even most of the Promising Youths who usually would be blazing with battle intent right now felt proud. This was simply human nature. When one shares an enemy, previous petty disputes can be ignored.\nHowever, the subject of public outrage wasn't paying attention to these matters at all. He sat on the ground cross legged, leaning on his thigh and supporting his head up from his chin with a hand. He stared blankly at the ground.\n??\nFrom an outsider's perspective, he seemed quite listless. But the tangible light that had been bouncing in his eyes only grew fiercer and fiercer as though he was slowly comprehending something new.\nNumerous gazes descended onto Leonel once more. But, no one could see the odd phenomena with his head lowered. As for Thunderous Clap, after speaking those words to Leonel, he hadn't even bothered to cast another glance toward him.\nThe first round continued, numerous youths going up one after another. The atmosphere was much better than it had been initially as many felt their anger having been vented, so a casual enjoyment of the gathering ensued.\nOne after another, the youths went up to show off their abilities.\nIt turned out that defeating the Invalids wasn't the true requirement. According to the rule Leonel missed out on, one was only meant to survive the confrontation for ten minutes. Anything at and beyond this would be considered a pass.\nThough Leonel casually killed the five Invalids, it could be said that he went above and beyond despite breaking the rules. Of course, this also meant that Thunderous Clap had also accomplished more than what was expected of him.\n\"… Violet Rain, no matter what, you're a Commander. Is there a need to look so happy?\"\nOne of the male Commanders by Violet Rain's side, a man who went by the code name of Mellow Trees, rebuked playfully. He could see that with each performance that surpassed Leonel's, this companion of his would smile wider and wider.\n\"I never knew that Violet Rain would hate a teenage boy so much.\"\nViolet Rain snorted and didn't say anything. Of course, this was because Old Hutch was still a small distance away and could most definitely hear their conversation. It was fine for them to tease her, but if she really said anything in affirmation, it was impossible to tell whether she'd have a good ending or not.\nHer happy expression became gloomy again upon hearing their words. But there was nothing much she could do. Luckily for her, the next youth was enough to make her smile again.\n\"Next, Chasing Wind.\"\nThe crowd seethed with excitement once more as a young lady wearing a tight, green tracksuit made her way onto the stage. Her every movement was graceful and carried an air of charm, but it was very obvious that it wasn't her trying to be seductive. It was a natural feeling ingrained within her bones. It could be imagined that even in battle, she would still maintain the same graceful bearing.\nChasing Wind casually looked through the weapon rack, testing out a few swords. Obviously, it seemed she had no intention of going barehanded like Thunderous Clap had. She felt no need to get involved in the dick measuring contest between men. Though, that wasn't to say she wasn't dissatisfied with Leonel as well, she just chose to remain quiet about it.\nAt least, these were her original thoughts. But, she began to look upon Leonel quite curiously when she saw him remained unmoved through all of this. Others might have written it down as cowardice, but she thought there was something weird going on that she couldn't quite put her finger on.\nStill, she threw it to the back of her mind…. Wouldn't she find out during the second round?\nThe young lady picked a well balanced short sword and made her way to the stage, standing calmly as though unblemished by the outside world. When the Invalids appeared, her picturesque figure suddenly moved, flashing forward in a light gust of fragrant wind.\nLike Thunderous Clap's suitably thunderous performance, she, moving as light as a feather, painted the perfect picture of Chasing Wind. Whenever one watched her movements, they couldn't help but take in every bit of her actions. The beautiful twinkling of her eyes, the rhythmic swaying of her hips, the delicate grunts that left her lips…\nShe fluttered between the Invalids like a butterfly, her speed too quick for them to attack properly. Her sword left lines of silver in the air, drawing graceful arcs that passed by five necks as though going through air.\nThe tips of her toes lightly landed on the ground, a small circle of wind and dust being pushed out as though clearing a place for her to land. How could such a beautiful woman be allow to fall onto a dirty stage? Even nature itself wouldn't allow it.\nWithout suspense, the cheers of the crowd erupted once more.\n\"Marry me Chasing Wind!\"\n\"Marry you? On what basis exactly? Take a look at yourself in a mirror once in a while.\"\n\"I don't care! If I can't marry Chasing Wind, I'll stay single the rest of my life!\"\n\"Don't you think you guys are a bit too fanatical? You've never even seen her face before. For all you know, her eyes are slanted and her face is covered in pockmarks.\"\nThe crowd within the vicinity of the middle-aged man who spoke these words looked at each other in a speechless moment before pouncing toward the man in unison as though they had agreed to it before hand. That day, there would no doubt be a man who left the arena beaten black and blue.\nViolet Rain watched Chasing Wind leave the stage with a gratified smile on her face. It was as though she was looking at a youthful version of herself. She didn't doubt that there'd be a day when Chasing Wind was a Commander just like her. In fact, she would likely be promoted beyond that.\n\"This concludes the first round, those who have qualified can now move on to the second and final round, of which… there are eight of you.\n\"These include: Thunderous Clap, Chasing Wind, Roaring Black Lion, Seer, Falling Leaf, Erupting Volcano, Precious Moment, and… Indomitable.\"\nA wave of boos rang.",

      "content": "[Only 1 chapter today. I was kidnapped away for birthday related matters, so this is all there is]\nThe smile on Violet Rain's face grew brighter and brighter. It was finally time for this farce to come to an end. Now that the second round had come around, there was no longer any words to hide behind.\n??\nA devious light flashed in her watery eyes as she turned on the voice projection system once more having gotten her fill out of the crowd's boos.\n\"I will now explain the rules for the second round as I did for the first.\"\nOne of the male Commanders by Violet Rain's side had a weird expression hearing these words. They were supposed to share hosting duties, so it was meant to be his turn to explain things. They had done this a couple times before already, so Violet Rain should be familiar with the process.\n'Whatever. The rules for the second round have always been the same anyway. It doesn't need to be me.'\nHowever, he had only barely finished thinking this when he was suddenly stunned by the next words he heard.\n\"The second round this time will be a seeded elimination tournament where your performance from the first round will be taken into account. You will be split into seeds one through eight.\n\"The first battle will be between seed seven and eight. The winner of the battle will go on to challenge seed six, while the winner of that will go on to challenge seed five. So on and so forth.\n\"In the end, whichever seed remains standing will be allowed to challenge the best performer from the first round.\"\nAfter being stunned a while, the two male Commanders looked toward each other and smiled bitterly. Even if they were beaten to death, they wouldn't believe that this wasn't targeting a certain person. But since Violet Rain hadn't done anything too outrageous, they really couldn't say anything. Plus, it wasn't like they could make her retract the rules she had already said, right? They had already lost face once today after readmitting Leonel.\nThe second round was indeed usually an elimination tournament. But, it was a normal one in which everyone battled at once. Eight would become four, then two, then eventually one. This modification of Violet Rain's was appearing for the first time in the history of the gathering.\nUnfortunately… since this was only the third gathering, no one picked up on the oddity. They only felt that the rules had changed, but they didn't think there was anything wrong with it. Like this, Violent Rain got away with it…\nPlus, even if things weren't like this, would the crowd really turn against Violent Rain for the sake of Leonel? If anything, they would give her their full support for dealing with the shameless man who dared to call himself 'Indomitable'.\nAs for the man who was being targeted himself? He wasn't even aware. Leonel hadn't taken part in the other gatherings so how could he know what was normal and what wasn't when even the fanatics in the crowd didn't?\nViolet Rain's smile grew as she continued.\n\"The bottom of the rankings will be decided by who lasted for the longest after crossing the minimum ten minute requirements. As for those who had the ability to kill the one or more Invalids, they will be even above that. Those at the very top will be decided by whoever defeated the five Invalids the quickest.\n\"Like this the seeds are as followed…\n\"First Seed: Chasing Wind. Second Seed: Thunderous Clap. Third Seed: Roaring Black Lion. Fourth Seed: Erupting Volcano. Fifth Seed: Falling Leaf. Sixth Seed: Precious Moment. Seventh Seed: Seer. And the Eighth Seed: …\n\"Indomitable.\"\nThe crowd was silent for a moment before cheers erupted once more.\n\"HAHA! Serves him right!\"\n\"Good luck going through our gauntlet of geniuses, 'Indomitable'.\"\n\"Indomitable? More like Indumbitable!\"\n\"… That was lame.\"\nAnother fight broke out in the crowd.\nViolet Rain allowed the crowd to get rowdy to their hearts content before continuing.\n\"Once again, I will reiterate the rules and regulations.\n\"First, anyone who kills their opponent will be subject to judgment by military law. This is a time of war, remember that. Your sentence wouldn't be anything lighter than the death penalty.\n\"Second, only weapons from the racks provided can be used.\" She took her time to emphasize the word only, and for good reason. \"Those weapons are all of the C-grade and can ensure fairness.\"\n\"Third, if I stop the battle for any reason, anyone who fails to obey in a timely fashion will once again be subject to military law. Disobeying the Command of a superior officer is worth at least a demerit.\"\nThis time, Leonel made it a point to listen to the rules so that he wouldn't make a mistake again. But, when he heard that the weapons of the rack were of the C-grade to ensure fairness, he had a weird expression. Though, no one could see it behind his mask.\nHis atlatl and darts were treasures from he received after clearing the Mayan Tomb Zone. They were C-grade treasures… So why was he disqualified?\nToward this, Leonel could only scratch the back of his head and shrug his shoulders. It didn't seem to matter anymore. After all, she had said that only weapons of the rack could be used, not that only weapons at the C-grade could be used. Though the difference was minor in a large sense, Leonel couldn't complain about it.\n'Oh, I guess since these are the rules, I should go up now.'\nLeonel stood and inadvertently yawned again. Toward this, he could only shake his head helplessly. He was truly too tired. It wasn't like he was doing it on purpose.\nViolet Rain's expression darkened. This boy should be very clear that she was targeting him now, yet he actually dared to be so carefree.\n\"First battle. Eighth Seed Indomitable vs. Seventh Seed Seer.\" She said stiffly.\nLeonel made it to the stage first, only to find a young man walking toward him. He had a scrawny build and a singular closed eye was painted on the forehead of his mask.\nIn his hand, Seer held an odd short staff with a bulbous head. Compared to the gazes of raging hatred Leonel had gotten used to seeing, Seer's eyes were calm and tranquil. His brows only barely furrowed when he saw that Leonel not only yawned, but also wasn't holding a weapon.\n\"Begin.\"",

      "content": "[We'll be back to double chapter uploads tomorrow. Thank you for the birthday wishes <3. Also, I should say that we'll likely be going back to the bonus chapter system in september once school comes back around for me. I'll let you all know]\nSeer raised his staff toward Leonel the moment the words fell. An arrow of peculiar energy quickly formed, dashing toward Leonel at a much faster speed than most could muster.\n??\nIn that instant of time, even with his spirit severely drained and his ability being sluggish as a result, it was as easy as breathing for Leonel to see that this attack had an agility of just over 1.00. It was quite swift, all things considered. But not enough for Leonel to take it seriously.\n'I guess I'll just push him off the edge of the arena.' Leonel thought.\nSince he had paid attention this time around, he was well aware that there were three methods of victory. He could choose between knocking his opponent out and rendering them unable to battle, forcing them to admit defeat, or pushing them outside the bounds of the arena. Either one was fine, Leonel didn't have a particular preference.\n'What's really interesting though is that abilities don't seem to be limited by Force disrupting towers, nor are special branches of Force. I didn't think about this before, but my Internal Sight relies on my spirit which is technically a kind of Force, yet I used it to escape the Fort. I actually overlooked something so simple…'\nLeonel's mind wandered. He usually wasn't this type of person. He always took every task, no matter how simple, with the utmost seriousness. However, the problem this time was that his mind was too sluggish, he was almost in a drunken state.\nThough Leonel was only like this because he didn't sense much of a threat from Seer, others seemed to take this as him being frozen in place due to fear.\nNot only did others not find this to be pitiable, they even took amusement in it. They seemed to already see the sight of Leonel being blasted off the arena under a chorus of laughs.\nHowever, in the last moment, Leonel seemed to remember where he was and shifted to the side. To an outside observer, it almost look like he stumbled out of the way, allowing the arrow to just barely whiz by him.\nThe sudden movement caused Leonel's mind to spin. He really didn't expect that he would be in such a sorry state just because he stayed awake for a few days.\nHis eyes blinked and he shook his head, trying to clear his vision.\n'A nap would be really nice about now…' Leonel thought to himself.\nLeonel didn't have to raise his eyes to sense that another arrow was coming his way. But, this time, he took a step long before it reached him. His action seemed without cause, but he had already dodged long before the arrow left Seer's staff.\nStep after step, Leonel meandered his way through the battlefield. His gait was weak and without rhyme or reason, but seemed to dodge Seer's strikes without much issue. From the outside, he looked like a drunk man stumbling forward, though it wasn't so exaggerated.\nSeer kept trying to make distance between them, doing his best to continue his barrage. But he was very obviously losing his composure.\nAt some unknown point, the jeers of the crowd shouting out that Leonel was fearful had slowly died down, weird expressions coating their faces one after another.\nBy the time Leonel had made it within a step of Seer, the latter didn't even notice that he had continuously retreated to the edge of the arena. Just when he wanted to take another step back, he found nothing but air, causing him to tumble backward with a shocked expression on his face.\nHe knew that this should have been impossible. He wasn't a fool, he too had heard the rules, so he knew stepping out of bounds meant a loss. But, he could have never expected that he would somehow still make such a stupid mistake. He thought that he had been circling the arena, maintaining a good distance from Leonel… So when did he get forced into a corner like this?\nWhen Seer looked up, all he found was that Leonel was actually yawning again, causing his face behind the mask to blush with shame, embarrassment and rage.\nLeonel squinted his eyes and shook his head as though trying to chase his fatigue away. He hadn't even noticed the change in the Seer's once calm eyes. By the time his vision cleared again, he saw that a young woman was helping Seer up and glaring toward him with fierce eyes.\nThough Leonel couldn't see her face, he was quite certain that her angry appearance was quite adorable. Her eyes alone were enough to tell him this.\nShe, as a participant, of course wore a mask. The design on hers was quite involved compared to others. The center of her forehead had the drawing of a seed and from there, a cycle of growth was drawn around her round face. Eventually, a flower bloomed before the cycle ended with another seed.\nLeonel had seen her amongst the eight seeds of the second round and judging by the pseudonyms, he guessed that she could be either Falling Leaf or Precious Moment. More likely the latter as there was someone else with a mask that more conformed to the former.\nAt that moment, the crowd that had fallen silent suddenly erupted once more.\nThe chorus of boos was deafening.\n\"Disqualify him! Get him out of here!\"\n\"When did such a bastard appear amongst our promising youths?!\"\nIt could only be said that the rebels truly were infuriated this time. It was one thing for Leonel to defeat his opponent. But, his act of looking down from the stage and even yawning after Seer had already lost was simply too much. You could defeat a man, but humiliating him was going one step too far.\nHow could they know that Leonel was only yawning because he was truly tired. As for 'looking down' on Seer, that had a similar reason as well. He didn't want to waste energy by making unnecessary movements, so he stood in place until the next match began. After all, he would be fighting again.\nUnfortunately for the crowd, the Leonel of now already had turned a deaf ear to their reactions. He couldn't even hear them any longer. His world was filled with silence.\n\"… Indomitable wins. Next match, Indomitable vs Precious Moment.\"\nAt that moment, the young girl who had helped Seer stand furiously marched onto the stage, her little body billowing with rage.\nLeonel shuffled from the edge of the arena, his feet barely lifting up from the ground as he turned to face her.",

      "content": "Leonel really didn't have the mind to think about why yet another person was angry toward him. His half closed eyes sized up the petite little girl.\nTruthfully, he didn't have much of a reaction toward women who weren't his Aina. It could even be said that his personality around Aina was skewed as a result of this. Usually, he was rather detached from most things even if he had an amiable smile on.\n??\nSeeing this petite girl before him, others might have had thoughts of going easy on her. But, Leonel didn't spare such a thoughts toward this at all. Rather, just like with his last opponent, he was thinking of how to defeat this woman as easily and quickly as possible.\n\"Go on Precious Moment, teach him a lesson!\"\n\"Show the bastard what a real Promising Youth looks like!\"\nViolet Rain watched all of this from the overseer's box, a gloomy expression on her face. She found that there was most definitely something wrong with Leonel's battle with Seer. However, all thoughts she had of analyzing the battle flew away when she saw Leonel yawn. At this point, even the male Commanders by her side couldn't help but frown. They too believed that Leonel had gone too far.\nOld Hutch laughed uproariously when he saw this scene. Since Leonel had been in his home the whole time, he of course knew why Leonel was constantly yawning. The reason he had been able to get Leonel's recording in the first place was because his home was covered in cameras and various security devices, so he was aware that Leonel had stood in the same place without moving for a whole 5 days.\nHe had to say, he admired the dedication of the boy even if he was certain that it wouldn't bear any fruit. That said, he had no intention of explaining this to these people. What could he say? He was an old man who liked watching the world burn. Who else was going to entertain him in his old age if not this boy?\nEarth had entered a calm before the storm. Old Hutch didn't feel like waiting for things to get interesting again, so why not make his own entertainment?\n\"Begin.\"\nThe moment Violet Rain's displeased voice filled the arena once more, Precious Moment moved, her small body charging toward Leonel with a full head of steam.\n'She wants to fight me bare handed? Is it related to her ability?' Leonel frowned slightly.\nAfter the shock he went through with Aina, he no longer dared to assume the strength of a person by their size. The issue was that he could clearly see that Precious Moment's strength stat wasn't even half of his own. Yet, she was still charging toward him like this.\nAt this point, Leonel felt a little regretful that he hadn't been paying attention to the previous battles, or else he wouldn't be guessing like this.\nHowever in the end, he threw these worries to the back of his mind. This wasn't really a matter of choice as the little girl was already right before him.\nLeonel caught a twitch in Precious Moment's shoulder and immediately calculated the trajectory of her punch before she even threw it.\n'I'm not far from the edge of the arena, I can probably just push her right off by using her momentum against her…'\nHowever, Leonel could have never expected that Precious Moment's initial punch was actually a feint. Just as he moved out of its trajectory, her arm stopped halfway along its path and pulled back against her body before another fist was sent toward him.\nA fierce glint could be seen in Precious Moment's eyes. The sight of Leonel's loss was practically guaranteed to her at this very moment.\nShe chose the name Precious Moment for a very specific reason. Her ability could be considered a sensory type as well, evolving similarly to Leonel's. She could read the cause and effect of events to predict what would happen next. Of course, the scope of her ability was extremely limited, but was absolutely perfect in a one on one battle like this one.\nShe had already predicted what would happen next. She saw through the fact that Leonel seemed to be able to see through the trajectory of her attack. He would then try to wrap around her and push her off the stage.\nKnowing this, she threw a feint, then immediately followed up with a second punch aimed exactly where Leonel was dodging.\nWith him being off balance like this, her victory was practically guaranteed. She might not be as strong as someone with an offensive ability, but she was still far stronger than a normal human.\n'Oh…?'\nThis was all Leonel thought when he saw Precious Moment's feint and follow up attack. Ultimately, his battle experience was still a little bit green. He wasn't yet able to easily distinguish between a real attack and a feint. He was mostly able to rely on his ability to always react quickly.\nThat said… Precious Moment was still underestimating him a bit too much. Her ability only worked when her enemy was within a certain physical limit. If they were beyond this… it simply didn't matter how much she could predict if she was unable to react.\nLeonel's dodging body suddenly grew a step faster, sliding out of the way of Precious Moment's second fist.\nIn one swift motion, he wrapped around her back, pushing a foot out and knocking her off the platform.\nEven as she fell from the arena, Precious Moment couldn't help but be stunned.\nShe was bound to not be the last. Under the continuously growing ugly expressions of those within the crowd, and Violet Rain especially, Leonel seemed to stumble his way through victory after victory, taking down Falling Leaf and Erupting Volcano in quick succession.\nAnd, even when Roaring Black Lion stepped onto the stage before him, his yawns had still never stopped.\nOld Hutch's laughter seemed to grow more and more unbridled. It was as though he was afraid others wouldn't hear him and forget their fury.\nViolet Rain ground her teeth, looking down toward the arena with a reddened gaze.\n'It's fine, it's fine.' She thought to herself, taking deep breaths. 'Roaring Black Lion was among the only three to defeat the five Invalids, albeit slower than Thunderous Clap and Chasing Wind. Defeating Indomitable shouldn't be a problem.'\nA sinking feeling took hold the pit of her stomach. If her own rule change allowed Leonel to use all seven of these geniuses as stepping stones, it would be too infuriating.",

      "content": "\"You're really good at pissing everyone off.\"\nThese were the first words Roaring Black Lion spoke. He stood tall with his arms crossed over his broad chest.\n??\nLeonel smiled bitterly. \"Would you believe me if I said it wasn't on purpose?\"\nRoaring Black Lion looked him up and down as though trying to decide whether or not Leonel was telling the truth. When he had spoken to Leonel previously, he hadn't gotten the vibe that he was an arrogant man. In fact, back then, he had half expected Leonel to sneer at his words from back then and tell him to screw off. He had been hoping for that result so that he would have an excuse to teach him a lesson, but things didn't end up working out like that.\nAfter that, he felt that Leonel kept giving him a weird feeling. It was an odd gravity that made others want to pay attention to him, and this pull was even stronger than Thunderous Clap who was a well known leader amongst the Promising Youths.\nHowever, that feeling was completely contradictory to the hatred Leonel was garnering. Would a leader who could surpass even Thunderous Clap in charisma be so hated?\nAnother person might have thrown this thought to the back of their minds as soon as they had it. But, Roaring Black Lion was a man who relied heavily on his instinct. This became even more so after awakening his ability.\nNot only did he smell the faint scent of death on Leonel, he could even tell that many of the things that happened today weren't exactly as they seemed.\nSuddenly, Roaring Black Lion began to laugh as the crowd booed toward Leonel's response. How could they believe that all of this had been a coincidence? Since they couldn't turn their rage to Hutch, who else could face their anger if not Leonel?\nThey felt stifled watching Leonel win battle after battle. Now, they were pinning all of their hopes on Roaring Black Lion's shoulders.\n\"I want to see your strength!\"\nThe roar of the Promising Youth's voice was several times louder than Thunderous Clap's.\nIn that moment, his body began to expand, the clothing on him expanding along with him as though it was specially designed for this moment. Black fur erupted across his body as his hair sprouted, becoming a mane that pushed against his mask.\nHis mask was removed by him. What was left wasn't the face of a human, but rather a fiendish lion with eyes deeper than a black abyss.\nRoaring Black Lion had grown to almost two and a half meters tall. He still stood on two legs and seemed to be a humanoid beast of sorts, but the power in his limbs put any full beast to shame.\n\"There it is! Roaring Black Lion's transformation!\"\nThe crowd was seething with excitement. Roaring Black Lion hadn't used his ability during the first round, so this was the first time they had seen it today. How could they not be excited? It was said that he was twice as powerful in this state!\nLeonel's eyes narrowed slightly seeing such a scene.\n[Roaring Black Lion]\n[Strength: 2.71; Speed: 2.12; Agility: 1.97; Coordination: 1.92; Stamina: 2.83; Reactions: 2.73; Spirit: 0.03; Force: ???]\nThe crowd completely regained their liveliness when Roaring Black Lion brandished his claws.\nHe raised his head into the skies and billowed with all his might.\n\"ROOOAAARRR!!\"\nThe arena quaked. In that moment, the roar drowned out even the crowd themselves.\n'That wasn't a simple roar…' Leonel's frown deepened.\nHe felt that his blood and his muscles cramped upon hearing that roar. It actually had the effect of demoralizing him and weakening his strength.\nAll of this suddenly made sense. Roaring Black Lion likely had an ability with great evolution potential. A normal strength enhancing ability wouldn't allow him to rank amongst the top Promising Youths even though the strength boost from his transformation was so obscene.\nLeonel regained his calm.\nTaking a step to the side, he calmly walked to the edge of the arena.\n\"Haha! Is he going to quit?\"\nThere wasn't just one person in the crowd who believed this. Even Violet Rain's gloomy expression loosened up a bit as she sighed a breath of relief. Unfortunately for her, though, this feeling didn't last for long.\nLeonel walked to the weapon rack and scanned it for a moment before pulling out a plain black rod. It wasn't that he didn't want to take a spear, but if he did and the ring on his finger didn't acknowledge it, it would crumble to dust. So, using a rod was his only choice.\nPlus, he had a good impression of Roaring Black Lion. At the very least, he was far more pleasing to the eye compared to the others that were here. In that case, he had no intention of harming him.\n\"A rod? Isn't that Thunderous Clap's weapon of choice? Indomitable uses a rod as well?\"\nLeonel sluggishly yawned once more, walking back to face the beast that now stood over half a meter taller than him.\nHe stopped ten meters from Roaring Black Lion, his eyes tired, but tranquil.\nSilence fell over the arena for a moment.\n\"Begin.\"\nRoaring Black Lion lashed out immediately, not pausing even for a moment.\nHis claws left streaks in the air. If it wasn't for the ban on killing, they would have been fully extended. However, for the sake of the rules, he attack with his palm. Yet, even with this being the case, his silvery claws twinkled beneath the arena lights, contrasting his ferocious appearance with something quite dazzling and beautiful.\nLeonel didn't move at all.\nA palm almost as large as his chest descended toward his tired figure. It seemed for a moment that there would be no suspense to the battle at all. It was even to the point where Roaring Black Lion's massive figure seemed to enshroud him completely.\nJust when it seemed Leonel would be sent flying, he suddenly moved.\nNo one could tell what happened. In one moment, Leonel was standing in place. In the next, a blinding light had covered him from head to toe. He seemed to vanish in place, and by the time he could be seen by the crowd once again, the butt of his rod had landed on Roaring Black Lion's broad chest.\nBANG!\nThe loose fabric of Leonel's sweat pants fluttered wildly beneath the air pressure of his own speed as Roaring Black Lion was sent flying. Almost like a streaking meteor, he left a black arc in the air, crashing outside the arena and skidding along the ground in a sorry state.\nSilence.\nAt that moment, Old Hutch, who had been leisurely enjoying his pizza stood up violently, leaping to the windows of the overseer's box as though he couldn't believe what he had just seen.\nLeonel calmly picked up the mask Roaring Black Lion had tossed aside, throwing it toward his collapsed figure just as the latter's ability dissolved. The mask left a trail in the air, landing just well enough to cover the youth's face.\nHowever, Leonel no longer cared about this. His head had already turned toward the place where Thunderous Clap sat.\n\"Hurry up.\"\nThese were the only two words he spoke. His fatigue seemed to vanish, the flickering lights that danced across his body growing more intense with each passing moment.",

      "content": "Silence.\nNo that wasn't entirely correct. There was indeed one sound remaining in the now quiet arena. On first inspection, it was a bit like breathing that hitched every so often. However, after a moment, it became clear that it was light snoring. Someone was actually sleeping. In fact, all of the people in the arena couldn't help but look between this sleeping young man and his recently decimated opponent.\n??\nOn the ground, laying right beside Roaring Black Lion, Thunderous Clap lay weakly, coughing up several mouthfuls of blood. As for the culprit who put him in this state? He was sleeping like a baby without a scratch on him, having collapsed under his own fatigue.\nThe scenes of what just happened continuously replayed in Thunderous Clap's head.\nThat man told him to hurry up and get onto the arena. As he had his own pride, he obviously obliged, believing that, even after watching the fashion in which Roaring Black Lion lost, he could still win.\nHowever, all he saw was a flash of gold. Then, he felt a sharp pain on his chest. And, before he realized what happened, he was lying on his back, nursing several shattered ribs.\nIn the overseer's box, Violet Rain's expression was solemn. One would expect her to be enraged, but this wasn't the emotion she had at this moment now at all. All she felt was astonishment.\nBut, her astonishment couldn't match up to Hutch's at all. This was because while everyone was shocked that Leonel managed to defeat Roaring Black Lion and Thunderous Clap — both in a single blow — he was shocked due to that radiant energy that was coming from him.\nThere was something about that energy that was extremely similar to his Blade Force, but it wasn't exactly like that either. It was somehow different but the same at once.\nHe didn't need to think more about it understand. Leonel had comprehended a Force Strengthening Deviation. But, it wasn't Spear Force. It was something else entirely, something that even seemed somewhat more formidable.\nIn the stands, Damian, the lady he called vixen, and the others were also shocked. They had been here from the very beginning, but they had remained silent the whole time.\nThey were among the few who knew that Indomitable was Leonel. But, did they dare to step out and defend him? Not to mention the fact the commentary of the crowd had been fairly benign, if they really did step up to defend Leonel, they'd probably get beaten black and blue.\nDamian had been aware of how great Leonel's strength was. Those youths up there would give even him a hard battle, and he was a lieutenant. But, didn't Leonel defeat him just the same?\nThe reason he was shocked wasn't because Leonel defeated them… It was because he had done so with just a single strike. Didn't that mean that Leonel could defeat him with a single strike too?!\nSo many eyes had landed upon Leonel, yet he continued to sleep without a care in the world. It was as though the hard arena ground had become the softest of beds.\n\"What a brat…\"\nHutch sighed and made his way down to the arena. Before the eyes of everyone, he reached down, grabbed Leonel, and swung him over his shoulder as though he was carrying a sack of potatoes.\nIf Leonel was awake, he might have had the presence of mind to get angry about this, but he was clearly in a state where he could sleep in just about any condition.\nThunderous Clap's gaze of shame and anger landed on Leonel. But, even if the latter was awake and willing to fight him again, he could hardly move an inch. Just breathing wracked his body with pain far more severe than anything he had ever experienced before.\nThinking back to those words he spoke to Leonel, a deep sense of humiliation welled up in his heart.\nIt honestly wasn't his fault that things reached this point. Anyone who saw Leonel's actions without understanding the backstory behind them would think him to be an arrogant bastard. Thunderous Clap had always been a straight forward and by the books kind of person, so he wanted to teach Leonel a lesson. He just never imagined that this would actually backfire.\nThe truth was that Leonel had already been reaching his limit after so many battles. He didn't tell Thunderous Clap to hurry up and get on the stage because he was arrogant, but rather because he only had the strength left for one more strike.\nLeonel couldn't be said to be a confrontational person, but Thunderous Clap's previous words had touched his bottomline. He refused to settle down until he could return the latter's words back to him.\nAfter the deed was done, Leonel directly fell asleep.\nDue to this, everyone knew that Chasing Wind would be named first among the Promising Youths, but there was no one who congratulated her. They were all aware that the young man who had truly earned the first place was the one they were all watching snore right this very moment.\nHer expression couldn't help but flicker several times as she watched Hutch haul Leonel away.\nJust what was that attack he used? Was that related to his ability? How could he be faster than her?\nThese were all the thoughts that swirled around in her mind and it left her stifled to the point she wanted to shout into the skies.\nIn the minds of the rebels who didn't know Leonel's true character, the villain had won today. Indomitable had stamped down on their pride, all while yawning the whole way. Then, when he saw they really couldn't relieve his boredom, he directly fell asleep.\nHe completely disregarded them. He didn't care for their emotions, their rage, their heartache. Like an evil mastermind, he played with their emotions and left them in a puddle of their own tears.\nWhen Leonel had disappeared off into the distance, Thunderous Clap could no longer hold on and directly passed out beside Roaring Black Lion.\nThis legend was bound to spread throughout the Slayer Legion, maybe even to the point it would reach the ears of the Empire…",

      "content": "Leonel awoke with a stretch. It felt so good that he held the pose for several moments, unwilling to leave that satisfying feeling behind.\nHe sat up with a smile. He was oddly happy at this moment. A burden that had been weighing on his heart felt as though it had been lifted. Plus, after finally getting some sleep, he felt refreshed and his spirit was even stronger than it had been just a few days ago.\n??\n'Even though he was an asshole, I have to admit that this Thunderous Clap person did indeed help me. If it wasn't for him, who knew how long I would have taken to come to such a realization.'\n\"You're awake?\"\nLeonel was so startled by the sudden voice that he practically jumped out of bed. He hadn't even noticed that the door had opened just now to reveal a very familiar and very annoying old man.\nOld Hutch shook his head, his face filled with disdain.\n\"How could you possibly sleep like this on a battlefield. I could have slit your throat a hundred different ways.\"\nLeonel's lip twitched. He had lived in a Mayan Tomb and faced thousands of Spaniards alone in that time. If there was anyone who knew how to sleep while being alert, it was him. But, was there a need for that right now?\n\"Since you're awake now, don't you think you owe me an explanation?\"\n\"Huh?\" Leonel didn't know what the old man meant by this.\n\"You were so confident in getting first place, yet didn't you only get second? You practically threw my face out there. How can I show myself in public anymore?\"\nHearing this, Leonel almost couldn't refrain from rolling his eyes. He may have been second, but did Chasing Wind really dare to claim first? As far as he was concerned, who was the superior among them all was obvious. But, he had simply been too tired. After teaching Thunderous Clap a lesson for the words he spoke, Leonel couldn't be bothered to enter the final round.\nOld Hutch could obviously see through Leonel's expression, but he didn't seem to want to let up.\n\"I don't care what reasons you have. I was promised a first place finish, yet I didn't get it. So, I'll be taking something in exchange.\"\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. What the hell did this old man want now?\n\"That light you used to defeat that brat Thunderous Clap and that other brat Roaring Black Lion. What was it?\"\n\"Oh…\"\nLeonel understood what was going on now. This old man just wanted to ask him this question without losing face. So he made it seem like Leonel owed him an explanation. Leonel could only say that Old Hutch was indeed shameless enough.\nIn the end, Leonel shrugged.\n\"I was studying my Lineage Factor and happened upon another one. I felt a very strong connection to it so I coaxed it out. The result should probably be some element based Force Strengthening Deviation.\"\nLeonel casually explained, but the words alone caused ripples to go off in Old Hutch's heart.\n\"Had I not been distracted, I would have comprehended Spear Force already.\" Leonel mumbled.\nThe truth was that he had been comprehending Spear Force, but this Lineage Factor intrigued him, mostly because it most definitely wasn't like the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor his father described. That likely meant there was a third Lineage Factor in his blood.\nIt could only be said that there simply wasn't enough time between Leonel's epiphany and the gathering, or else he would have been even more monstrous.\nAfter setting himself on the path of logically deducing his own talent and Lineage Factors, a whole new door had been opened to him.\nThe bad news about this path was that he would progress slower than his Lineage Factor would otherwise allow him to. Theoretically, that is.\nRelying on instinct and talent is usually much faster. This was just the way of life. However, Leonel had a certain advantage those who were lacking in talent did not have: his ability.\nLeonel's analytical ability was far beyond most. As a result, his progress was actually faster than it would otherwise be by relying on talent and intuition.\nThis not only meant that Leonel could forcefully awaken his Lineage Factor's himself as long as he grasped a small inkling of them, it also meant that he was no longer restricted by the so-called 'awakening' phase of the Lineage Factor either.\nAccording to Aina, the longer one maintained consciousness after awakening their Lineage Factor, the stronger it would be. However, for Leonel who was slowly comprehending his Lineage Factor himself, it didn't matter if he stayed awake for a single second or several days. Eventually, he would unveil all the hidden mysteries of his Lineage Factor. At most, if he didn't stay awake for long enough, it would be slightly more difficult than it would otherwise be.\nThat said... Hadn't Leonel just stayed awake for five days? That was even longer than he had when he awakened his Spear Domain Lineage Factor.\nLike this, the 'bad' of his path was essentially expunged as long as his ability continued to evolve.\nWith this, the good was nearly endless. Aside from thanking Thunderous Clap, Leonel really had to thank Hutch as well. Or else who knows if he would have ever stumbled on this path at all.\n\"So that light really was a Force Strengthening Deviation?\"\nOld Hutch finally responded after a while. Hearing Leonel say that he could have comprehended Spear Force already by now made him want to give the brat a smack, but he refrained since he wanted to know more.\n\"Yes…\" Leonel said slowly. \"… I still know very little about it. All I've unveiled is that it can increase my speed by a large margin. I still have to study it more…\"\nThere were many things Leonel left out.\nFor example, he was certain that if this Lineage Factor wasn't from his father, then it must be from his mother. In addition, he hadn't only unveiled that the Force Strengthening Deviation he had learned through his Lineage Factor could boost his speed, but he also knew that it had terrifying piercing power. Had he used this latter ability, he would have directly killed his opponents with ease even if he only used a rod.\nBut, Leonel still wasn't at the point of divulging his everything to Hutch even if he was grateful to the old man.\nWhat Leonel and even Old Hutch didn't know was that what Leonel had grasped was Light Elemental Force. Old Hutch might have known what this was, but Leonel's explanation was simply too vague and purposely omitted many points.\nIf others knew that Leonel had comprehended such a thing, the shock would be immeasurable. Even among Force Strengthening Deviations, Light Elemental Force was among the strongest. Its versatility was near inexhaustible and its strength was undeniable.\nHowever, even with this being said, the real reason it would arise shock was because it was simply too rare. Amongst several worlds, there might only be two or three people to grasp such a thing. And, families with Lineage Factors related to it were even rarer.\nIt was no wonder Leonel instinctually set aside comprehending Spear Force in favor of it. Compared to Spear Force, Light Elemental Force was beyond by an impossible degree.",

      "content": "\"Is this why you came here, Old Hutch?\"\nIn truth, Leonel was more interested in this old man leaving him alone. Not only did he want to comprehend Spear Force, but he also had many other things to do. He really hoped that Damian hadn't left by now, or else he had no idea how he would get back to Royal Blue Province.\n??\n\"Not exactly.\" Old Hutch said after a moment. \"There's a Hunt that was planned to take place for the first time this year. It's a great training ground for you little brats.\"\n\"Not interested.\"\nLeonel responded without hesitation. What a joke, he had already wasted so much time here. Every day he spent on Earth was another day that passed in Terrain. In fact, for all he knew, time was dilated across worlds as well just like they were in Zones. He had no way of knowing until he went there.\nHe had no idea why Hutch was trying to get him to participate in these meaningless activities, but he truly was not interested. Even before he comprehended Light Elemental Force, it was unlikely that anyone in his age group could defeat him. But now, it was even more exaggerated. He simply saw no merit in it.\nAt this point, Leonel understood that his advantage was simply too vast. His father was likely from a higher Dimensional world, so his body had more talent than those born in a Third Grade Dimension like this one. It couldn't be helped.\nOf course, there were those like Aina who seemed to match up to him due to their mysterious families. But, this was even more reason for Leonel to not care about the Slayer Legion. The fact the fourth rank youth of their Southern Lookout could be defeated in a single strike by him likely meant that the Slayer Legion likely had no such families, and as a result, didn't have a bright future.\nLeonel still remembered Aina's words. Success in the future could track back and influence the past. Though it was difficult for him to wrap his mind around, he only needed to understand that this was a fact. Since the Slayer Legion didn't have such special families, it only meant that their future was equally not as special.\nThat said, Leonel wasn't very optimistic that those youths from families like the Brazinger's were a match for him either.\n\"Don't be so quick to dismiss this opportunity.\" Hutch said without a care. \"This Hunt won't be as simple as you think it is.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nHutch nodded confidently. But, seeing that Leonel was still skeptical, he decided to explain a bit. It was obvious to him now that Leonel would be a future pillar of Earth, so he should be privy to a few things that others weren't.\n\"Since you even know about Force Strengthening Deviation, you probably know already that many were aware that this Metamorphosis was coming before it truly descended.\"\nLeonel's expression darkened a bit at these words. Of course he had already guessed this. How many billions had died falling from Paradise Islands due to the higher ups keeping this information to themselves?\nIt seemed now that even the Slayer Legion was aware of this ahead of time, something that made Leonel even more disappointed in them than he already was. Was this really a so-called rebellion of the people? Why was it that this Slayer Legion never seemed to act as a grassroots movement should?\nHutch sighed upon seeing Leonel's gloomy expression.\n\"Things aren't always as simple as they seem on the surface, brat. If we made a move to try and save everybody, Earth's population would have likely been wiped out by now.\"\nLeonel frowned upon hearing this.\n\"The likelihood of successfully awakening your ability is too low. It's even lower if you come from a poor background.\"\nLeonel clenched his jaw. He understood this well. The weaker your background, the less likely you were to succeed in the future, and as such, you couldn't effect change in the current timeline that would then, in turn, help your future path. These people were the least likely to awaken their abilities. It was a difficult chicken and the egg situation.\n\"If we tried to save everyone, Earth would have been overrun by Invalids. Even though Invalids also provide opportunities to improve upon killing them, they are incredibly dangerous as well. They don't need to rest, eat or sleep.\n\"These are things you probably already know, but what you don't know is that when the concentration of Invalids is high and that of humans is low, Variants that consume other Invalids can appear in high concentrations. When this happens, the Invalids that awaken their intelligence once again appear in droves.\"\n\"… Isn't that a good thing?\" Leonel asked.\n\"No. It's the worst thing. Invalids who awaken their intelligence are no longer humans. They're Variant Invalids who still live to devour us. The only difference is that they're smarter in their approach. In addition, they all have the ingrained ability to control other Invalids. Don't think for a moment that they'll go back to the person they once were after they awaken…\n\"Variant Invalids are far stronger than us. As the saying goes, the harder something is, the more rewarding it is as well. The path Variant Invalids have to go through to truly awaken is far more arduous than us, and as such, the benefits are far greater as well.\"\nOld Hutch could tell that Leonel still wasn't convinced by all of this. The kid didn't believe sacrificing the lives of so many just because of a potential calamity was worth it. These were still people… They weren't betting stakes one could choose not to take the risk on.\nThe old man could only sigh once more.\n\"Kid, there are too many eyes on Earth. The potential of our world is the greatest to be birthed in a very long while. There's no end to the greedy eyes that see us as a feast to take part in.\n\"If we are stuck in this prepubescent stage for too long, taking too much time to clear our world and form up our centers of power again, then, when we lose the current thin veil of protection we have, we'll be screwed.\"\nLeonel remained quiet. Even if he understood, he didn't like it at all.\n\"… What is this Hunt you were talking about?\"",

      "content": "After a while, the old man left, leaving Leonel to his thoughts.\n'It's interesting, I guess…'\n??\nLeonel didn't expect to be interested in this Hunt. But in the end, the old man had actually managed to convince him. Plus, it would apparently not interfere with his schedule to go back as Damian and the others would still be stuck here for a while longer.\nAccording to the old man, the Hunt had been being planned not just a few years, but decades even. It might not even be an exaggeration to say more than a century, in fact.\n'Project Hunt' could be considered to be one of Earth's contingency plans. If Hutch's words were to be believed, it was likely that a similar practice was taken on by the Empire as well.\nThis so-called 'Project Hunt' was an attempt to raise Evolved Beasts. As Leonel had so unfortunately found out already, humans weren't the only ones who could awaken.\nThe project itself spent years diligently breeding and cross breeding different species of animals to create incredibly powerful creatures. The hope was that upon the descent of the Metamorphosis, these creatures would awaken miraculous abilities that would allow humans to benefit.\nThese beasts would become great natural resources. Their meat would be the best tonic for human warriors, allowing them to progress at much faster speeds.\nAlso, according to Hutch, beasts have much larger Ethereal Glabellas upon awakening. This is not only due to their larger size in general, but it can also be considered an evolutionary buffer to their intelligence. After all, beasts are innately inferior in this aspect. Those who successfully awaken are thus compensated in this way.\nThe larger Ethereal Glabellas of beasts are considered to be delicacies that can even improve the speed of evolution of one's ability. They're called Beast Crystals.\nThinking back to the octopus stored in the Segmented Cube, Leonel suddenly understood why it was that the latter had wanted the former so badly.\nAfter all of this, Leonel was even more impressed with exactly where these projects took place. When he asked Old Hutch about that, the old man hadn't held back.\nApparently, Project Hunt took advantage of the fact that Earth only had one super continent and spread the project across several off-land islands. Each of these islands had their own unique environment, pushing the evolution of beasts in certain aspects.\nNow, after so much preparation, it was finally time to reap the rewards of their labor of over a hundred years.\nLeonel wasn't interested in the beasts for the potential boost to his ability. Since his ability had already broke into the realms of the Fifth Dimension, he doubted that there were any beasts on Earth that could help him improve any further.\nBut, Old Hutch had let it 'slip' that the closer Earth approached to the end of the Metamorphosis, the more striking changes would take place. Soon, there would be Force Crystals forming and these islands could be ideal hot spots. After all, even if one appeared in the city on the main land, it wasn't as though Leonel could dig through the layers of dense stone and metals to reach them.\nThese places would be perfect toward helping him fill his Segmented Cube to the brim to pave a path for his later breakthroughs.\nEven this, though, wasn't the main reason Leonel's interest had been piqued.\nAfter so long, Leonel was finally ready to create his first Force Craft. In fact, he had already settled on two designs. One was a weapon and the other was an upgrade to a treasure he already had.\nThe second design, the upgrade, was related to his treasure shoes. However, the main point was that the main design around the upgrade was reliant on the suction cups of the octopus.\nBy now, his purpose might have been obvious. He wanted to see just what other Evolved Beasts existed. If there were any that were particularly useful, he might be able to design more useful upgrades…\nLeonel took a deep breath and finally stood from his bed. A moment later, he had already entered the Lab Setting of the Segmented Cube's Phase One.\n\"Hey Little Tolly.\"\nAfter completing Lesson Three and learning everything there was to know about the relationship between familiars and their Force Crafters, Leonel named the little Metal Spirit Tolliver, a name the little guy seemed to like quite a lot.\nLeonel smiled lightly, slipping on his protective gloves and allowing the little Metal Spirit to excitedly snake across his fingers. For a moment, man and spirit seemed to become one. Leonel's fingers danced and Tolly's body seemed to respond instantaneously, changing its movements along with Leonel's will.\nA long while later, Leonel finished playing with Tolliver and placed the little guy on the table, turning a serious eye toward the several large pieces of paper laid out before him.\nAfter Leonel learned everything there was to learn about Lesson Three, the next touched on Force Art, and the Lesson after that was titled 'Functional Design'. This Lesson not only taught him basic concepts of design, but, most importantly taught him about drawing blueprints.\nLeonel had never taken an art class before, nor was he familiar with calligraphy. After all, this was the 25th century, nobody writes anymore. So the first few attempts he made were abysmal. But, over time, with how high his coordination stat was, not only did he improve by leaps and bounds, his penmanship could even be said to be quite beautiful.\nCalligraphy on Earth referred to the writing of characters. In ancient Eastern countries, this was especially important to their culture. However, the West had quite a few practitioners as well.\nTo Force Crafters, Calligraphy referred to the art of drawing Force Arts. Each branch of Force Art was a unique language with its on unique quirks. A steady hand and a keen eye was, of course, important for all of this.\nThankfully, Leonel's basics were exceptionally robust. Due to the Force Art he had drawn on the back of his palm, his knowledge of Third Dimensional Force Arts was incredible. So, when he moved on to Fourth Dimensional Force Arts as he was now, the result was him improving at unimaginable speeds.\nThe blueprints before Leonel now were the product of several hours of work. But, he still felt like something was missing. It was an intuition that kept nagging at him. He knew that if he designed his first weapon based on these designs, it would fail.\nAt that moment, Leonel suddenly slapped his forehead.\n'Idiot. Why waste time drawing all of these blueprints in real life when you have your Dream World?'\nLeonel closed his eyes and sunk into a state of meditation. A moment later, he found himself in a wide blank space, but there was a bright smile on his face.\nA quill identical to the one Montez gave him manifested in his hand. This was the product of a Dream Sculpt he forged.\nThen, he began to draw in the air.\nThe scene was absolutely dazzling. The sight of several layers of blueprints being built atop of each other with glistening transparent lines made it almost feel as though Leonel was playing God.",

      "content": "It was as though a whole new world had opened up to Leonel.\nEven someone with an ability as analytical as himself had been having issues with the blueprinting process. It wasn't that his mind didn't have enough computational ability, but rather that he simply didn't have enough experience.\n??\nSince this was his first creation, it was only made of three parts. Yet, the process of transferring those ideas to their individual blueprints, then visualizing the 2D in 3D while ensuring that all the parameters are within appropriate margins of error was difficult for a newbie like Leonel.\nImagine for a moment that you had to design a screw and the hole it would screw into. From the outside, this seems incredibly simple. However, this isn't the case at all.\nThe grooves of a screw that allow it to solidly embed itself into the appropriate hole could be measured in millimeters. If the hole is a fraction too big and the screw is a fraction too small, suddenly, the error compounds and you have a useless screw on your hands.\nThis was the absolute simplest example. What if the parts are more complex than this? What if there's more than just two parts to consider?\nLeonel was dealing with three parts currently, but he already had a headache. Ensuring that machine parts work smoothly as one even when they were manufactured separately was probably the bane of all engineers. But now, Leonel felt that he had solved this problem that plagued all beginner Force Crafters.\nIn the blink of an eye, Leonel had drawn out the blueprints for all three of his parts and laid them flat in the air. Though his arm moved as though he was really 'drawing', this was his dream world. Was there even a need to actually do so? At most, this was a little fanfare.\n'So it's like this…'\nLeonel's eyes shone brightly, internally kicking himself for not realizing he could use his Dream World in this way.\nIf he entered his Dream World, then used Dream Sculpt to build up the individual parts of his creations, it was possible to test everything before he even began. Not only this, but he could check the feasibility of his designs without causing irreparable changes to the materials he was handling.\nLeonel pinched his fingers toward one of his blueprints and pulled them apart, causing the design to expand. Before Leonel's eye, what once was a flat drawing gained form.\nIn a flash, the other two pieces followed suit, then, along with the closing of Leonel's hands, they came together and formed a complete treasure.\nIf someone else was here, they would immediately recognize it as a handgun, albeit a uniquely shaped one.\nThe nozzle was incredibly long and narrow for a gun of its kind. It was just over a foot in length, but barely a centimeter and a half in width.\nIts handle was thick and ergonomic. If Leonel were to reach out and grasp it, it would perfectly form to his hand. However, if one looked closely, it was possible to see many small holes spread all across its surface.\nThis was the true secret of this gun. It could work with bullets, but the main reason Leonel created it was thanks to its ability to function even without bullets.\nThat was right, Leonel designed this gun to work similarly to the invisible attacks of the Mayan Priest or the arrow of Seer's staff. All he had to do was pour his Force into it and it would form and shoot the projectile for him.\nAs for how this projectile would compare to Seer or the Mayan Priest, Leonel was certain that its speed and piercing power would be more than double. However… Those were calculations he had made before he awakened his Light Elemental Force. If he used Light Elemental Force instead of normal Force, the effect would definitely be even more exaggerated.\nThe trouble was whether or not his design could take it and whether the Force Arts he chose to pair with this treasure would be enough.\nLeonel exploded the size of his design again and narrowed his eyes, allowing the hovering design to spin slowly before him. He wanted to grasp every single little detail.\n'The design I settled on is very simple. The nozzle, the hollow grip, and the weight.\n'When I pour Force into the gun, the weight within the handle is pushed up. The moment the energy is released, the weight will shoot back down to its original position. Depending on how much Force I use, the rebound can be either stronger or weaker. Thanks to this, the recoil mitigation can be properly scaled depending on the situation…'\nCompared to the anti-recoil technology of the Empire's best guns, Leonel's could be considered to be rudimentary to the extreme. In fact, he knew there were many problems with it.\nFor one, the current design only accounted for vertical recoil, but not horizontal. Leonel felt that this was an easy fix. If Leonel angled the weights ascent and descent, he could account for this as well.\nLeonel mentally made the changes that were needed. And, thanks to his Dream World, they immediately manifested in the design before him, causing him to smile beside himself.\n'The next issue is the nozzle. The longer the nozzle, the more time the bullet will have to accelerate, but it also makes it a weak point of the design.'\nLeonel thought about this for a long time. If things remained like this, he didn't believe that the nozzle would last very long. It was too fragile.\nAfter a moment, Leonel came to a conclusion.\n'It's impossible to create something perfect. Everything has give and take. Instead of worrying so much over this, I should instead modify the design so that the nozzle is a fail point that can be easily swapped and replaced.'\nWhen Leonel came to this decision, instead of making the nozzle stronger, he actually purposely made it much weaker. There was no need to invest too many materials into something that was bound to fail. Not only did he make it weaker, but he added many natural breaking points so that repair would be easy and simple.\nThese break points would not only allow the nozzle to fail in predictable ways, but it would also ensure that its failure wouldn't harm Leonel. It would be too great of a joke if Leonel's gun exploded and killed him mid battle.\nLeonel planned on making two guns and ten nozzles. This way, he could swap the nozzles mid battle if necessary.\nWhen Leonel settled on the final design, he used Dream Sculpt to create perfect memory fragments within his mind. Now, he was ready to begin.",

      "content": "Leonel exited his Dream World and smiled, taking the little Metal Spirit into his hands and playing with it again.\n\"This'll be our first project together, Tolly. Are you excited?\"\n??\nTolly split into numerous balls of silver, jumping around Leonel's hands like little globules of mercury. The little guy didn't need to speak for Leonel to know that it was excited.\nRecently, Leonel had been feeding it a lot of metals. Earth might have not been a Fourth Dimensional world just yet, and as such, was lacking in high quality minerals that came with this evolution. But, they as a people had squeezed everything they could out of the materials they did have, creating alloys that this little Metal Spirit loved to eat at its current stage of evolution.\nTolly's favorite snack was an alloy of platinum and iridium. Using it, the little guy had already reached the Fifth Black Tier.\nLeonel was very careful not to overfeed Tolly, though. According to the hazard lesson, doing so could cause 'Overflow'. It was a dangerous state spirits could enter where they sought to devour everything.\nToward this, Leonel could only shake his head. His father had actually likened the state to a stomach ache. How such a catastrophic event could be as simple as a stomach ache was beyond him.\nLeonel took a deep breath and went into a state of meditation. This time, however, it wasn't to enter his Dream World, but rather to prepare his mind and settle his heart. His father said that the most important thing in a successful crafting was one's state of mind.\nHis oppressive aura unwittingly surged out from him, causing the playful Metal Spirit to grow silent and solemn. It was easily affected by Leonel's presence, its own will becoming somewhat suppressed.\nThe first step in crafting was exactly this, Spirit Unity.\nDuring the process, Leonel and Tolliver would have to work as one. It was necessary for their thoughts and actions to be one in the same.\nAt that moment, Leonel's dull gaze became bright once more and two familiar ores appeared before him.\nTolliver separated into two, coating each one of his palms as he grasped toward the first ore.\nThis unrefined ore was known as 'Black Urbe Ore'. It was part of the 'Urbe' class of metals. Those of this class were exceptionally good at forming alloys and had strengthening effects on metals they were melded with due to their special chemical structure.\nUrbe ores were a strategical resource no matter which world one was talking about. They were a foundation piece in almost every treasure in existence and were key components in treasures that needed to fuse two volatile materials.\nBlack Urbe Ore was considered the lowest grade. However, if it was combined with the high level metal technology of Earth, it was like giving wings to a tiger.\nEven compared to other Pseudo Fourth Dimensional worlds, Earth was incredibly advanced. If strength was strictly compared, Earth was most definitely the strongest such world in the history of the universe. Actually, it wasn't so exaggerated, but Earth was most definitely top ten.\nLeonel already had a plan in mind and the sniper rifle he took from Xinghai's corpse would be perfect.\nIt was time to begin the second step: Purification.\nThere were many ways to approach purifying a metal. In the world of Force Crafting, 'purification' wasn't as simple as removing impurities. It was more accurate to say that this was the process of a Force Crafter 'treating' a material to create a wanted result.\nConsider steel, for a moment. Technically, steel is just iron with a certain concentration of added carbon. If Leonel's goal was to make steel, then his 'purification' process would be taking iron and smelting carbon into it, thus producing the desired product.\nOne must know that even amongst steel, there are various stages, purities and strengths among them. This is all decided by the process taken in forging the metal. Urbe ore, likewise, works in this fashion.\nLeonel's goal was to temper the Black Urbe ore such that its chemical structure was perfectly suited to the alloys of the sniper rifle. How well he performed this task was decided by a 'Compatibility' rating. Depending on the metals and materials used in the craft, the Compatibility of a metal prepared, even in the same exact way, could vary.\nThe methods he had to choose from were Smelting, Macro-Separation, or Oscillation. Leonel had already learned all three, respectively, via the techniques [Melting Hands], [Dancing String] and [Delicate Touch].\nWithout hesitation, Leonel began to use [Delicate Touch]. The ore became like a bouncing ball trapped between the cage that was his fingers.\nThe movement of his hands became blinding. Despite the fact his arms and wrists were locked in place, his fingers continually flicked at the ore, causing it to slowly, but surely, turn a deeper and deeper shade of red as its body became hot. However, the odd part was that this red only seemed to appear in spots that didn't seem capable of spreading their heat elsewhere.\nThe Oscillation technique was one of Induction. It was the process of agitating the chemical structure of the metal and raising its heat. But, it was special in that it could target very specific chemical bonds, causing them to break and restructure themselves according to the Force Crafters will.\nThis alone made the Oscillation method the most difficult of the three. Controlling things on such a micro level while ensuring that the heat wasn't spread was nearly impossible for beginners. Of course, Leonel wasn't really controlling things on an atomic level. He was simply able to use his strong Internal Sight to separate the ore into larger sections to be tempered individually.\nIt was impossible for the current him to create a 100% Compatible Metal as that would require being able to use his Internal Sight to scan minerals at the level of chemical bonds. However, about 60% was well within his grasp.\nIf others knew that Leonel was confident in such a thing, it would definitely cause an uproar. Even veteran Black Grade Force Crafters would find 50-60% acceptable while 40% was passable. Something like 70% was already above average, 80% was elite, 90% was legendary, while 100% was basically folklore. Who could claim to be capable of commanding the trillions of atoms in an ore perfectly?\nLeonel's Force poured from his body and into Little Tolly without reservation, the rhythmic drumming of his fingers growing faster and faster.\nBeads of sweat fell from his forehead, but he didn't even take the time to wipe them, his eyes shining brighter and brighter with each passing moment.\n'[Dancing String]!'\nLeonel's rhythm abruptly changed as Tolliver shot out from his palms, covering the reddened ore.\nLeonel pinched his fingers on either side of the ore and pulled, elongating the hot ore into a thin line, folding it over itself, and pulling once more.\nAs though he was working a dough, Leonel stretched and folded the metal continuously, his fingers oscillating in a mesmerizing rhythm.\n'Perfect. 67% is better than what I was expecting.'\nLeonel didn't allow himself to bask in his success. He immediately reached toward the sniper rifle he had already separated into its parts the moment the Black Urbe Ore was prepared.\nCompared to the Black Urbe Ore, dealing with the pre-processed alloys of the sniper rifle was much easier. The compatibility rating of the Urbe Ore was precisely decided by how well it could meld into these alloys. This meant that the last of Leonel's task was simply to combine the two and then inscribe his chosen Force Arts.\nHe could almost see the final product before him. And, considering he had practiced many times in his Dream World already… was failure even possible?",

      "content": "Leonel really didn't expect that he would be the subject of so many glares again so soon, but this was the reality before him.\nAt this moment, he stood on the deck of a ship anchored a distance away from an island covered in a forest so thick one could hardly see in a few meters from its coasts. However, even with such a beautiful destination before him, Leonel found it difficult to enjoy because the youths that took part in the gathering were all sending looks toward him that just might tear him apart.\n??\nHowever, Leonel really couldn't mind any of this now because compared to a few days ago, he was even more excited to go on this hunt.\nAccording to what the leading Commander of this Hunt just said, a Commander that just happened to be the very same Violet Rain who oversaw the gathering, this Hunt would decide who would gain a quota to enter an SS-grade Zone.\nThis was most definitely an unexpected surprise for Leonel. Since Old Hutch hadn't known that Leonel had been scouting out high level Zones, he had never said anything about it. The old man hadn't said a word about it, thinking that he was successfully tricking Leonel into another task. He had no idea it would have convinced Leonel to join much quicker had he been more honest.\nAs for the reason why Leonel was looking for high level Zones, that was obviously so that he could earn a Tier 9 Black Reward so that he could go to Terrain and find Aina. Unfortunately, Leonel had vastly underestimated just how rare high level Zones were. It could be said that he was both lucky and unlucky to stumble upon the France Zone the way he had.\nStill, if others knew that Leonel was dissatisfied with the rarity of high level Zones, he would probably be beaten to death. After all, each Zone needed to be cleared, it was a requirement. If Zones weren't cleared, a world would never be able to finish their Metamorphosis and could even have its timeline swallowed. It was most definitely in Earth's best interest that these Zones were as rare as possible.\nOf course, such being the case, entering such a high level Zone wasn't a joke. This Zone apparently had a 12 person entry limit, and only three spots would be available to them. The rest would go to high ranking officials of the Slayer Legion who had great combat experience.\nBut, this alone was enough for Leonel to take this Hunt more seriously. Entering this Zone was essentially his ticket to seeing Aina again. If it could be said that before he was only a bit curious about what benefits this island might bring him, now he wouldn't allow anyone to get in his way.\n\"… those who collect the most Beast Crystals will be ranked accordingly. However, do keep in mind that this island isn't a controlled environment like you're used to. There's no way to know what kind of abilities these animals have awakened nor is there anyway to tell what sort of threat they pose.\n\"And, if you believe the beasts are the only danger, you'd be wrong. The Eastern Lookout will be participating in this Hunt as well. Be wary of the human heart.\"\nViolet Rain scanned the youths with an apathetic gaze.\nThough her eyes landed on Leonel for a moment, it didn't linger there any more than it did on another person. It seemed that she had regained her bearing as a Commander in recent days. At the very least, her one sided hatred of Leonel wasn't bubbling to the surface anymore.\n\"I've said all I've needed to say. You all can go.\"\nThe youths were stunned.\nThey could go? What was that supposed to mean? They were still hundreds of meters from the island!\nEven if it was before the Metamorphosis, swimming in the ocean like this wasn't exactly the safest thing. Even if one disregarded the potential dangerous creatures, just swimming against the waves alone would sap up their energy.\nAll of this was amplified several times more after the Metamorphosis. It was widely accepted that the oceans of Earth were practically a forbidden zone now. If it was already difficult to explore the oceans before, it was at the point now where no one even dared to do so.\nIt was at that moment that the boat they were all on suddenly rocked, caused by someone using it as a spring board to leap toward the open waters.\nWhen they saw who it was, flames of competition couldn't help but be lit in the depths of their souls.\nThis was the man they all hated. If they lost to him in strength, it was still fine. But, if they lost to him in courage too… where would they put their faces?\nThunderous Clap watched Leonel's figure leap through the air. The eyes he had toward the latter didn't seem to contain the hatred it once had. Instead, there was a deep unwillingness and the fire of a competitive spirit.\nIn truth, he still didn't believe he had misjudged Leonel. Since the others still weren't aware of the circumstances behind 'Indomitable's' rise, they still thought Leonel was an arrogant prick. It was just that he happened to be an arrogant prick with the strength to back it up.\nHowever, hatred wasn't the emotion he had for Leonel. All he had said was the truth. He really could beat them without Hutch's help. In that case, it wasn't arrogance, it was simply a fact.\n'I wonder, between him and those top few… who's stronger?'\nThunderous Clap was only ranked fourth. Yet, he knew that those the Slayer Legion truly saw as their future pillars wouldn't even be risked by being allowed to appear on the rankings. It was quite a joke. His goal was those people, yet he couldn't even rank first on the list they disdained to appear on.\nThis was all to say that he couldn't fathom why it was they had allowed Leonel to appear on the list… But to him, this was a good thing. He could finally measure himself to those hidden monsters, he finally had a target to chase after.\nThe gazes of the youths watched on as Leonel glided across the waters as though it was solid ground. Then, one after another, they dove in.\nViolet Rain's watery eyes twinkled at this scene.\n'I guess it isn't so bad even if he might be a spy. Like this, these little pups can have a fire lit beneath them…'",

      "content": "'Alright, it seems that this is the limit.'\nAt this moment, Leonel crouched on the highest branch of a tree that could support his weight, concealing himself within the dense foliage as he analyzed the gun in his hand.\n??\nThe gun had quite a simple sleek silvery black look to it. Its nozzle was especially long and narrow, leaving it heavily weighted toward the handle. But, Leonel favored this design very much. Since it was like this, the long nozzle wouldn't influence his shot downward.\nThough the gun looked to be intact, if one looked closely, it was possible to see several fine cracks along its surface. Leonel estimated that this nozzle could at most take two more shots before it broke along the points of weakness he purposely built in.\nAfter testing it, Leonel knew the limits now, and they were exactly in line with the experimentation of his Dream World. A single nozzle would last somewhere between 20 to 30 normal Force shots. However, if he used his Light Elemental Force, it would at most last 2 to 3 at most.\nIf Leonel used the second phase of the gun and loaded it with a projectile he modified from his atlatl darts, then it could shoot just one.\nThough things were like this, there was good news as well.\nLeonel twisted and pulled the chipped nozzle off. After slipping his protective gloves on, he pulled Little Tolly from the Segmented Cube and got to work.\nHe immediately activated [Melting Hands]. This technique worked similarly to [Delicate Touch] in that it heated up materials using the oscillation of atoms, however, it was much simpler to use because its application was broader. Since the nozzle's alloys were already set, there was no need to use [Delicate Touch] to fine tune the metal characteristics, so it was more of a brute force technique rather than a finesse technique.\nLeonel's fingers worked deftly. Almost like a musician plucking the strings of a harp, he worked in unison with the little Metal Spirit, melting down the metal.\nUpon sensing that the metal had reached the ideal temperature for molding, Leonel used Spirit Unity with Little Tolly to project the Dream Sculpt image of the nozzle's blueprint. This communication with extremely steady and completely without flaw, displaying the prowess of Leonel's ability once again.\nMost beginner Force Crafters who use Metal Spirits struggle with this step. The advantage of Metal Spirits is that they were able to mold metals into incredibly intricate parts just by comprehending the will of their partners, however, was this really so easy?\nHow many could think of a single thing without straying? Even if you wanted to focus on a single thing, could you guarantee you wouldn't have a few stray thoughts? And, even if you succeeded in not having any, could the image you projected truly be perfect?\nThe human mind was known for playing tricks. Often, memories are easily distorted. The only way for a Force Crafter with a Metal Spirit familiar to circumvent this weakness is by constantly tweaking the image they send through Spirit Unity. Only in this way can they ensure the final product is perfect.\nHowever… Leonel had his Dream Sculpt? Was it even necessary for him to do such a thing? The image he projected would always be perfect.\nLittle Tolly acted quickly, wrapping the melted body up and shaping it into a thin rectangle of metal in what seemed like the blink of an eye.\nLeonel's eyes flashed, his palm flipping over to reveal a quill with a beautiful white feather.\nTaking advantage of the moment, Leonel's hands moved swiftly. Force Art after Force Art was drawn across the surface of the floating rectangular piece of metal.\nOf these Force Arts, there were three kinds. One was a Force Compression Art, the second was a Force Acceleration Art, and the third were Force Barrier Arts.\nThe Force Compression Art concentrated the Force Leonel poured into the gun into a fine point. The Force Acceleration Art made the nozzle into a rail gun that accelerated the Force bullet continuously. And, finally, the Force Barriers were arranged along the inside of the nozzle such that the bullet was forced to follow a winding path that would give a stronger spinning action to the final product.\nThere were multiple Force Arts of each kind dotted along the inside of the nozzle, making it look as though it was densely packed with graffiti. Yet, it still exuded a mysterious and somewhat ancient aura.\nThe moment Leonel penned the last Force Art, the rectangular sheet of metal rolled close under Little Tolly's manipulation, forming a nozzle completely identical to the one that Leonel had just melted down. The only difference was that this one didn't have even a single crack on it.\n'16 minutes and 24 seconds. Not bad, I'm getting faster.' Leonel smiled to himself.\nIf others knew that he had just Force Crafted while squatting on the balls of his feet, high up in a tree… It was just best you didn't compare yourself to others.\nObviously, with how much time it took, Leonel couldn't do this mid-battle. But, it was definitely not too much of an inconvenience. After all, he had two guns and ten nozzles total. The only reason he had bothered to reforge this nozzle now was for the sake of preparedness. Since he had time now, there was no need to ruin a second nozzle, or else he wouldn't have time to cry later should a worst case scenario situation happen.\nLeonel put the gun away after twisting the newly made nozzle onto it. Then he smiled, watching Little Tolly rush around his fingers as though the little guy was seeking credit.\n\"Yes, yes. You did very good.\"\nLeonel didn't want to keep putting the little guy into the Segmented Cube, so he let Little Tolly stay out. His father had made it clear that keeping the little guy cooped up wasn't a good thing, so it was only right he let it out every once in a while.\n'Alright, I've already collected over 20 Beast Crystals from a few B and A-grade threats. I guess I should look for a greater challenge this time…'\nAccording to Violet Rain, B-grade crystals were worth one point, A-grade were worth ten points, and S-grade were worth a hundred. There was a month of time, so though Leonel was fairly certain he was far ahead at the moment, he knew this wouldn't be enough for him to slack off.\nSuddenly, Leonel shook and fell from the tree branch.\nTo an outside observer, it seemed that he had lost his footing and was now paying for it. But, just a moment later, the branch he was sitting at was blasted away. No, even the side of the tree trunk it was attached to looked like something had taken a bite out of it. The issue was that… there was nothing there!\nDespite the fact there was nothing to be seen with the eyes, Leonel's alertness was on high. He felt all the hairs on his body stand up, the residual effects of fusing with the primitive man's consciousness still benefiting him.\n'Dammit, if I fall to the ground like this, I'll definitely break a few bones.'\nLeonel's jaw clenched. At that moment, his back was facing the ground as he fell and his eyes were trained on the place the branch he squatted on had just been. If he didn't brace himself for the fall, he would suffer. But, he still didn't dare to turn away.\nLeonel involuntarily blinked. It was a normal action, no different from the thousands of times he had already done it in his lifetime to this point already. However, he could have never imagined that, this time, it would come with dire consequences.\nIt was only a split moment, but when Leonel opened his eyes once more, a streak of black was already about to hit his chest.\nWas it going to do to his torso what it just did to the tree? And why was it that his instincts were screaming at him? Telling him that his Quasi Bronze chain necklace would be of no help…",

      "content": "Leonel's thoughts accelerated. A moment later, he understood where this feeling was coming from.\nIn the past several months, he had learned quite a lot about Force Crafting. In that time, how could he not look into his Quasi Bronze chain necklace? After suffering the barrage of several bombs, it had suffered a few minor cracks, but Leonel could tell that those 'minor' defects actually decreased the strength of the treasure by as much as 10%.\n??\nDuring his studies, Leonel had learned about the type of treasure his necklace was. As an energy based defensive treasure, it also came with several downsides.\nOne of those downsides was an inability to function in the presence of Force disrupting towers. This was something Leonel learned personally, much to the sadness of his shoulder. But, most importantly, it was incredibly fragile when meeting higher level Force types.\nWhat did this mean? It meant that whatever was in the process of attacking him now had grasped a Force Strengthening Deviation.\nWhether or not this Force Strengthening Deviation was powerful or not compared to other didn't matter. All that mattered was that it was at the very least a level beyond normal Force.\n'Dammit. Aren't these deviations supposed to be rare? How the hell did I randomly come across one like this?'\nAs Leonel continued to fall to the ground, he couldn't help but lament his bad luck once again. At the same time, he caught the faint inkling that though this 'Project Hunt' provided good opportunities, it could very well create new enemies for Earth as well.\nIf there were other beasts this powerful… Let's just say Leonel didn't want to think about it.\nJust as the black light was about to collide with his chest, Leonel's right sole lit up and he stamped down hard, sending him shooting off to the side.\nAs he did this, he couldn't help but shake his head. First it was the chariot, now it was this weird creature. When he chose these treasure shoes, he had never thought that instead of using it to glide through the air, he'd always be using it to escape a sorry state.\nLuckily, he had already upgraded his treasure shoes. Now, the cool down on their activation was only 30 seconds and they also provided a boost to his leaping ability.\nThe moment he gained some distance, Leonel took out his two pistols, firing four rapid shots, two from each.\nSHUU! SHUU! SHUU! SHUU!\nUnlike a normal gun, the sounds of Leonel's shots were no different from whistling wind. However, even compared to a gun of the 25th century, though the range was at most half a kilometer, Leonel was confident that the piercing power and lethality was a few levels higher.\nFour pellets of white energy shot forward, spinning so quickly that they left spirals of air in their wake. For the span of the blink of an eye, it seemed like they were the center of their own miniature hurricane.\nHowever, before they could even land on their mark, Leonel's eyes widened.\nThe line of black energy vanished into thin air, blinking away before the energy spheres could hit it.\nPUU! PUU! PUU! PUU!\nThe four bullets tore through the opposing tree, leaving the same number of small holes in its bark and easily tearing their way through the other side before disappearing into the foliage.\nThe rustle of leaves of sounded as Leonel disappeared into the dense canopy of a tree he had kicked himself toward. He landed on a branch with a dull thump, the wood beneath him swaying up and down beneath his weight.\n'… It disappeared?'\nLeonel couldn't help but think back to Xinghai's blink ability. Could it be that this weird beast both had such an ability and access to a Force Strengthening Deviation? Wasn't this too exaggerated? If it had been any other youth who came across this creature, they'd likely already be dead.\nThe greatest trouble was that Leonel's Internal Sight was seemingly having problems locking onto the target, almost as though it was able to hide from the fluctuations of his Soul Force. This made this beast a hundred times more complicated to deal with.\n'This is at least an SS-grade threat…'\nLeonel silently waited for the beast to strike again. When facing an enemy like this, the worst thing he could probably do would be to move about randomly and allow it a chance to find an opening. It was best he stayed still, raising his awareness to its maximum and keeping his reflexes primed.\nAs Leonel did this, he began to concentrate his Internal Sight into a smaller radius. This was a technique he learned in Force Crafting. It was usually used so that a crafter could maintain quality control of their craft by increasing their observational ability, but Leonel now realized that it applied perfectly to combat as well.\nHe never thought there could exist something that could hide from his Internal Sight, but now he had been taught a lesson. He really had to be ready for anything in this new world order.\nThe sharp range on Leonel's Internal Sight was continuously compressed by him. It took a toll on his spirit to do this, but he didn't have any other choice. How else could he deal with an enemy he couldn't see?\n200 meters became 100. 100 meters became 50. 50 meters became 25. At this point, Leonel had reached his limit and as much as five minutes had already passed. But… there was no sign of the beast that had attacked him.\nLeonel clenched his jaw and continued to wait, not moving even after half an hour had passed. But, there was still no sign of the creature.\nWith sweat pouring down his forehead, he had no choice but to release his Internal Sight, allowing him to gasp deep breaths. He knew by now that the likelihood the creature was still stalking him was low.\n'Was it scared away…?'\nLeonel had always heard that animals were more afraid of humans than humans were of them. But, he didn't really know if this was true or not. At the very least, it seemed that this beast was gone.\nJumping down from the tree, Leonel soon landed on the ground. After taking a look around and realizing that the creature really wasn't going to attack him, he began to approach the center of the island with more caution.\nLeonel flipped his palm over, causing a silver disk to appear.\n\"What Force Strengthening Deviation did that beast use?\"\n[ *Ping* Replying to Seed, there are fluctuations of Dark Elemental Force in the air ]\nLeonel didn't react much to this, but this was only because he wasn't aware of just how unlucky he was. Dark Elemental Force was just as rare as Light Elemental Force. Yet, he had actually been marked by such an entity.\n**\nAt that moment, on the other side of the island, another ship could be found anchored. A group of youths jumped from its side, swimming toward the shore with ambitious glints in their eyes.\nHowever, neither those youths from the Eastern Lookout, nor the youths that came with Leonel from the Southern Lookout, was aware that there was a third gathering taking place as well.\nNearby a large lake on the island, a gathering of beasts was taking place. Though none of them exchanged words in a human sense, there eyes seemed to tell a different story.\nFrom an outsider's perspective, all that could be heard was a series of grunts and growls. However, if one paid close attention and removed themselves from their preconceived notions…\nThese animals seemed to be having a meeting.",

      "content": "Unlike the youths from the Southern Lookout who had been stimulated by Leonel to the point none of them even suggested forming a group upon entering the island, the youths of the Eastern Lookout were different.\nWithout someone like 'Indomitable' egging them on, they didn't think twice before forming groups of two or three, walking through the dense forests together.\n??\nThe top three youths of the Southern Lookout, setting Leonel aside, were Roaring Black Lion, Chasing Wind, and Thunderous Clap. Likewise, the Eastern Lookout youths had their own top three as well.\nOne would expect these youths to be leading groups of their own, maybe having too much pride to share a stage together. But, this wasn't the case at all. In fact, the top three youths of the Eastern Lookout formed a group together, hoping to maximize their profits and monopolize all three spots to the SS-grade Zone to themselves.\nRanked seventh on their Promising Rankings, there was a young woman who went by the name of Flowing Wind, a name not much different from the third ranked of the Southern Lookout, Chasing Wind.\nHer form of dressing was particularly provocative. Other than a sports bra and a pair of skin tight spandex shorts, she wore nothing else. Though her face was covered by a mask tattooed in red swirls not unlike Chasing Winds green swirls, her fiery figure alone was enough to set one's mind ablaze.\nIt could only be said that she put more worth in her looks than her own safety, or else she would never wear such a thing upon entering a forest with unknown dangers like this. Well, it was either that or she was extraordinarily confident in her abilities…\nRanked fifth on their rankings, there was another young woman who went by the name 'Pisces'. The first feature about her that stood out was her flowing blue hair. What was even more striking about this color was that it was possible to tell that this color was definitely not dyed in the slightest. It could only be said that her awakening had caused this mutation…\nMaybe it was something weird about the culture of the Eastern Lookout, but Pisces too was dressed particularly inappropriately. Though her clothing wasn't as provocative as Flowing Wind's, she still wore a flowing blue dress that was completely out of place. Not only this, but her dainty bare feet could be seen poking out from its folds with every step. She hadn't even worn shoes.\nAs if these two weren't weird enough, the third of the was a young man ranked second on their rankings. He went by the name of King of Seas.\nHe carried around a golden trident that stood a head taller them him. It reflected the rays of the sun so well that it illuminated the forest despite how few rays made it through the thick canopy above.\nThis alone wasn't enough to raise an eyebrow. The true problem was that he was wearing nothing but a speedo, revealing his bronzed torso and thighs, each portion of which was rippling with muscles.\nAs though this wasn't enough to leave a person speechless, his speedo seemed to be made out of a brass metal, making it look more like a chastity guard than a piece of clothing. It was impossible to tell whether this young man had done this on purpose or not.\nIt could only be said that this group of three was simply too weird…\n\"There's something off about this forest.\" Flowing Wind spoke in a low voice. \"Though we've already gathered a few beast crystals, it doesn't seem to be as many as we should have.\"\nThere was definitely something off. According to theory, animals should have the same chance at evolution as humans did. After all, there was no reason for the Laws of the Universe to favor humans over any other species. It wasn't impossible even for plants and vegetation to evolve.\nThis was all to say that even if humans didn't go out of their way to breed powerful animal sub-species, they would have likely awakened powerful members among each other regardless. If this was taken into account, the beasts they had come across to this point should be far more powerful. But, from Flowing Wind's perspective, they seemed to be quite… normal.\n\"Your perspective is just skewed.\" Pisces said lightly. \"With the three of us here together, how could these animals not be easy to deal with? If you just consider the fact the most we've come across are B and A-grade threats, this is impressive enough.\"\n\"Maybe…\"\nIt seemed that Flowing Wind was itching for battle. She was completely unsatisfied with the challenge and even somewhat regretted forming a team with these three. If things were like this, wouldn't the next month be too boring?\n\"If you're really feeling bored, there's still some other entertainment on this island.\" Pisces said with a light smile. \"We could just find a few of our peers from the Southern Lookout to exchange some pointers with.\"\nKing of Sea's gaze sharpened at these words. It seemed that even though he was stoic and a man of few words, this prospect still made him feel quite anxious.\n\"Hm?\" Flowing Wind's steps paused. \"Finally, something interesting.\"\nWithout saying a word, she shot into the distance, not even explaining her actions to her two team members. It was almost as though she didn't care whether or not they followed her.\nAfter sending a glance toward one another, King of Seas and Pisces could only shoot forward. Flowing Wind was their scout, without her, finding the next target would be a few times more difficult.\nIn the distance, Roaring Black Lion was in a fierce battle with a black bear. Considering he had already entered his beast form and the thin line of blood flowing from the corner of his lip, it was obvious that he wasn't having an easy time.\nIt was a small clearing of green within the dense forest, yet it managed to contain such a savage battle. The palms of Black Roaring Lion and the black bear continuously slammed against their opposition's chest. They looked like two madmen having a contest of brute strength.\nIf one looked closely, it was possible to see that the immediately vicinity of the black bear seemed to have sunk into the ground as though its great weight was effecting change on a much grander scale…\nFlowing Wind appeared by the edge of the clearing, her eyes lighting up when she recognized Roaring Black Lion's beast form.\n'Rank fifth on the Southern Lookout rankings… hehe, seems like I'll have a good harvest today.'",

      "content": "Half a month later, Leonel could still be found walking around the forest. Though his harvests could be considered to be great, he was still in an incredibly sorry state.\nHis Quasi Bronze chain necklace managed to mend his clothes in places they had once been torn, but the limp in his gait, the caked blood and dried wounds on his skin, not to mention the paleness on his face were things it couldn't do anything about. This led to a situation where his clothes were in mint condition, yet his body looked like it had just gone through a hundred consecutive battles.\n??\nIf one had followed Leonel from the start to now, one would see quite a weird scene. First, Leonel would find himself a beast to target. Second, he would easily kill that beast. And, finally, just when he was feeling complacent in his victory, that very same damned streak of black would attack him from an unpredictable angle.\nAt this point, Leonel had already had dozens of fights with that unknown beast. And though it couldn't be said that he always definitely lost, he most definitely didn't win either.\nIt really was too much. He had no idea why this thing was targeting him, but it rarely even allowed him a moment to rest.\nBy now, Leonel had learned from the dictionary that Dark Elemental Force, and his Light Elemental Force for that matter, weren't normal Force Strengthening Deviations. Each was incomparably rare and powerful. But, this only made him feel more aggrieved.\nJust what were the odds of a beast with such a rare ability deciding to target him? Where was the justice?\nAt first, Leonel thought that maybe those with Dark Elemental Force had some baked in bias against those with Light Elemental Force. But, this didn't seem to be the case at all. He almost laughed at himself for having this thought.\nThis wasn't some cheap anime his dad liked to watch. There wasn't any light side versus dark side nonsense going on here, this creature just apparently didn't like the way he looked. What other explanation could there be?\nLeonel sighed.\nIn a motion he had practiced one too many times, he flipped his palm, allowing his long-nozzle pistol to appear. He hardly shot a glance at his target before he fired, causing a white pellet of energy to pierce through the left eye of a fox that had been stalking him in some thick bushes. The poor thing hardly new how it died.\nAnd, once again, as though on cue, a flash of black headed for the back of Leonel's head.\nLeonel dove forward, ducking and rolling out of the way.\n'Eat this.'\nLight Elemental Force surged from Leonel's hand and into the pistol. A sharp eye would easily notice the nozzle bulge a small bit before a bead of golden energy shot out from it, barely able to hold out under the power of the bullet.\nSHUUUU! BANG!\nThe streak of black dodged once more as usual, but Leonel heard its faint 'yip' that almost sounded like the bark of a small dog. It usually made this sound whenever Leonel sent an attack toward it that could threaten it and it was something Leonel had been hearing more and more often lately.\nThe golden bullet collided with a tree that would take ten men to wrap around. Yet, it was blasted through as though no more resistant than a piece of paper.\nThe bark, the wood, its innards, all of it, was completely vaporized.\nEven though Leonel didn't have much of a reaction to it now, the first time he had seen the strength of Light Elemental Force, he was stunned silent.\nLeonel grit his teeth. 'You damned beast.'\nThanks to this thing, he couldn't eat, sleep, or even relax. Yet, there was still half a month more in this hell hole. How could he not be aggrieved?\nUnfortunately, before he could launch another attack, the beast disappeared again. Once again, from start to finish, Leonel didn't even catch a glance of what it was. He only managed to decipher that it must be a small creature of some sort. Outside of that, he really knew nothing else.\nLeonel took a deep breath, calming his agitation. He found a tree to lean against and slid down, taking a rest.\nAside from this particular annoyance, this Hunt couldn't be said to be completely without merit.\nFor one, he had come into contact with many beasts that provided interested prospects for Force Crafting. The only unfortunate part was that none of these would help him to repair his chain necklace. Unfortunately, he didn't have the skill to repair such a high level treasure.\nHis two pistols could be ranked around the Tier 5 or 6 Black. It could be said that it was his accuracy and his Light Elemental Force that made them so lethal. In his hands, they were no weaker than a Tier 9 Black treasure, but in someone else's, Tier 6 was the best they'd be able to hope for. Such a treasure was about Leonel's limit at this moment, something that left him a bit disappointed.\nBut, if these matters were put into perspective, just how shocking was it that Leonel, who had just stepped foot into the Force Crafting world, could already be considered a Tier 6 Black Force Crafter?\n'Hm?'\nLeonel noticed that there was someone coming toward him. But, since it was a human and not an animal, he didn't bother to move. This wasn't because Leonel assumed that this person wouldn't be hostile. The words Thunderous Clap had spoken to him were more than just a small wake up call to him about the kind of world he lived in now. Rather, it was that he didn't think this person in particualr could harm him even if they wanted to.\nWhen that person entered the clearing Leonel was resting in and saw that it was him, they were stunned for a while.\n\"Indomitable, it's you.\"\nThe person didn't seem to be hostile. Of course, Leonel immediately recognized him. It was none other than Erupting Volcano, one of the young men Leonel had defeated during the gathering. It was easy to tell from the molten magma drawn directly onto his mask.\n\"Hello.\" Leonel said as a polite greeting.\nThough Erupting Volcano's face was covered by his mask, Leonel could tell from his eyes that he was stunned. Toward such a thing, he could only bitterly laugh. Did they all really take him to be such a bad person? Even to the point they were shocked by something as simple as a greeting?\nErupting Volcano suddenly felt hesitant, not knowing how he should approach.\nLeonel laughed lightly. \"If you have something you want to say, just say it. I won't bite you.\"\nHearing such words, Erupting Volcano relaxed slightly.\n\"I don't know how much you know about what's going on right now?\"\n\"What's going on?\" Leonel's brow furrowed.\n\"As expected, you really weren't aware. In the past half month, there've been a few skirmishes between us and the Eastern Lookout participants. We were caught off guard because most of us traveled alone while they traveled in groups. A lot of us got ambushed and had our stash of beast crystals taken away…\"\n\"So that's what happened…\" Leonel mumbled.\n\"You know about it?\"\n\"Well, a group did try to rob me a few days ago. But…\"\nErupting Volcano smiled bitterly. Leonel didn't need to finish. He knew those people hadn't succeeded. Shaking his head, he continued.\n\"What's more pressing is the lack of S-grade and above beasts. Even A-grade beasts have been getting scarcer and scarcer.\"\nLeonel frowned. Now that he thought about it, this was true. He only didn't notice because that creature was always attacking him. He knew that little thing was at least an SS-grade threat. With such a beast constantly haunting him, where would he get the time to think about why stronger creatures weren't appearing?\n\"It can't be that we've already hunted them all?\" Leonel asked probingly.\nErupting Volcano shook his head. \"That's impossible. Even though this island isn't as big as a continent, it's still at least a hundred kilometers in diameter. The population of beasts should be in the tens of thousands. We don't even number a hundred total, how could we clear them all in a few days?\"\nLeonel nodded. This made sense.\n\"So none of you have an answer to this?\"\n\"Well… we've been trying to go to the center of the island for a long time. The problem is that there are a lot of rivers and lakes blocking the way there with dense populations of dangerous underwater creatures. I'm actually part of a scout sent out to find and stragglers so we can come together to make a push.\"\nHearing this much, Leonel fell into his own thoughts. Ultimately, he chose to follow only for the sake of his own curiosity. Why were the beasts acting so weirdly?",

      "content": "Near the center of the 'Project Hunt' island, there was a gathering of not so inconspicuous youths taking place. Some were looking toward one another with vigilance and hostility that could hardly be concealed.\nIf one could set aside the peculiarity of the atmosphere, the surroundings itself was quite? beautiful. Many lakes, rivers and rolling hills could be seen. The only issue was that it all seemed quite unnatural.\n??\nIt felt impossible that such a scenery could be formed organically. It was almost like a painter laid down a fantasy world on their canvas, only for it to somehow pop up and become a reality.\nThe rivers wound in and out of the lakes like ribbons of water flowing as they pleased. Some of them didn't even take the green hills as obstruction, crawling up their sides and falling down the other in small waterfalls.\nIt really was a beautiful sight. But, it seemed that none of the youths had the mind to care about such things as they looked toward each other with vigilance.\nRoaring Black Lion stood to one side, his gaze practically spitting fire as he looked toward a group of three youths. There were numerous wounds across his body, making it obvious that Leonel wasn't the only one having a hard time during this Hunt. But, judging by the hostility in his gaze, it was obvious that while Leonel was suffering at the hands of a beast, it seemed that he had suffered at the hands of his fellow man.\nIt wasn't just him who had such wounds and carried such animosity. Aside from Chasing Wind — whose indifference was maybe somewhat obvious considering the speed at which she could escape — they all had such gazes, even Thunderous Clap.\nToward such eyes, Pisces, Flowing Wind, King of Seas and the rest of the Eastern Lookout youths could only chuckle. Who asked the Southern Lookout Promising Youths to be stupid enough to travel alone? If it wasn't for this, would they have suffered such obvious losses?\nOf course, there was one group amongst the Eastern Lookout fellows that didn't seem to be having such a great time. However, rather than having their eyes trained on a particular person, they were constantly scanning the surroundings as though trying their best to find their prey.\n\"I know I'm beautiful, but is there a need to stare at me so intently?\" Flowing Wind blinked her eyes and brought her elbows together, winking flirtatiously at Roaring Black Lion and Thunderous Clap, both of whom had suffered due to her.\nThe action was really too provocative. She was hardly wearing much to begin with. Now with this, it felt as though all her assets might pop out at any time.\nThunderous Clap didn't even spare her a glance, but Roaring Black Lion looked her up and down. Despite the rage in his eyes not dispelling, it seemed he was perfectly fine with enjoying the show. And why not? He didn't have to turn a blind eye to her beauty just to get his revenge, right? He would teach her a lesson regardless.\n\"If you want to look some more, I don't mind. But you'll have to get a little closer.\" Flowing Wind said sweetly.\n\"I wouldn't mind coming closer, but you look a bit fragile. I might accidentally snap you? half.\"\n\"Oh? But that's exactly what I want.\"\nFlowing Wind blinked with expectation as though hoping Roaring Black Lion would cross the distance between them at that very moment. She looked every bit the part of a woman who couldn't wait a moment longer.\nHowever, the underlying murderous intent was clear to the point that if one closed their eyes and only focused on her words and not her tantalizing figure, it would sound as though she was inviting you to the depths of hell rather than her bed.\nThat said, Roaring Black Lion didn't seem to notice as he took numerous broad steps forward. In a moment, he was so close to Flowing Wind that her ample chest just barely grazed along his ribcage.\nShe stood with her hands on her hips, looking up at Roaring Black Lion with an 'expectant' glint in her eye.\nJust when it seemed that the atmosphere might take a turn for the worse, the sound of shuffling grass and a snapping twig sounded. Many looked over to find a pair walking toward them, both of who were young men. One had molten lava painted onto his mask, while the other wore a plain white one.\nEveryone on the Southern Lookout side seemed to recognize both young men and even shot complicated gazes toward the latter. However, a hint of confusion could be seen amongst those of the Eastern Lookout. Well, almost all of them.\nThere was one particular group that seemed to have found the prey they were looking for. Almost like ravenous dogs tied to a chain they couldn't wait to free themselves from, they stared toward Leonel with all the animosity they could muster.\n\"You know who he is?\"\nPisces who was used to being the only one of her group of three who thought about the overall situation noticed this distinct change.\nThrough gritted teeth, a young man who had red veins painted across his mask and went by the name 'Ruptured Artery', spoke.\n\"We were tied up in a tree and couldn't get down for three days because of him. We nearly starved to death.\"\nPisces frowned upon hearing this information.\n\"He was alone?\"\n\"… Yes.\"\n\"And he still subdued you all without killing you?\"\n\"Yes…\"\n\"Or injuring you?\"\nAt this point, Ruptured Artery stopped speaking. He was already enraged enough without having to deal with the odd gazes he and his group was now receiving.\nHowever, the others of the Eastern Lookout could only look toward Leonel with vigilance. Ruptured Artery wasn't the best among them, but he wasn't the worst either. If he participated in the Southern Lookout gathering, he would have been the fourth or fifth seed. On top of that, he had been alone, yet he had been tied up in a tree without the ability to resist…?\nEven with all this being said, the reason they were so apprehensive was because Leonel was a complete unknown… They had never even heard of him until this very moment.",

      "content": "Leonel didn't react much to all of the eyes on him. He was much more interested in learning what was going on here. This place looked so beautiful, but judging by the fact they were all at least a hundred meters away from the nearest riverbank, nothing was as simple as it seemed.\n\"Hello.\" Leonel spoke first. Though he didn't think the amiable smile he had on right now was helping very much considering the fact he was wearing a mask, he still used it out of force of habit.\n??\nThose of the Southern Lookout responded to Leonel's greeting with awkward nods, while those of the Eastern Lookout didn't say much of anything. Most were only curiously observing Leonel, however, the young man in question walked by them all and approached the closest riverbank.\n\"Indomitable, wait!\"\nSurprisingly, it was Roaring Black Lion who called out. Hearing the voice, Leonel couldn't help but stop and look back.\n\"It's dangerous. There's a group of creatures hidden in the lake led by an exceptionally powerful leader. Some of us almost lost our lives.\"\nWhen he was saying these words, Roaring Black Lion sent glares toward the Eastern Lookout youths once again. They had reached this place long before they had, yet hadn't said a word. Obviously, he had more than just one grievance with this group of people.\nLeonel nodded. \"Got it. Just want to check something.\"\nLeonel turned back and continued to walk forward. Roaring Black Lion didn't try to stop him again, he had already done all he could. Plus, it wasn't like he could stop Leonel by force.\nIt wasn't long before Leonel had made it to the side of the closest river. He tried to reach in with his Internal Sight, but he suddenly found that passing it through water was a lot different than air. In fact, his range was reduced by a factor of ten, barely stretching down a couple tens of meters.\nIn truth, this should have been enough to make it to the bottom of most rivers. But, the issue was that not only was this river much deeper than usual, but even if it wasn't, the fact was that there was still the rest of its length and width to deal with. Even if he could see to the bottom, he could still only look to the left and right a few tens of meters.\nIt didn't take Leonel long to decide that it was a fruitless endeavor. Instead of continuing to do something useless, he flipped his palm, causing the corpse of a deer with particularly sharp antlers to appear in his hands.\nThe others were stunned by this. Some even had eyes that gleamed with curiosity and greed, most of whom came from the Eastern Lookout. It wasn't that those of the Southern Lookout were better people, it was just that they knew enough about Leonel to not foolishly think of stealing his things.\nSpatial treasures were already innately high grade treasures. They were all at least A-grade treasures. But, this alone wasn't enough for the to turn their greedy eyes toward Leonel. The most important point was how large of a space Leonel's spatial treasure must have.\nWhat they didn't know was that this carcass wasn't taken from Leonel's spatial bracelet, but rather from his Segmented Cube.\nIn recent days, Leonel was really lamenting not knowing more about the Segmented Cube earlier. It was actually able to house Little Tolly just fine even while within his spatial ring. Had he known this earlier, he could have stored Aina inside it while he escaped that day instead of sending her off to some unknown world.\nBut at this point, he could only sigh. It wasn't like he could go back in time.\nLeonel turned his attention back to the riverbank. Then, with strength that surpassed a normal human, he tossed the deer carcass toward it.\nThe reaction was immediate.\nThe calm surface churned. In one moment, there was not a life form in sight. But, in the next moment, the water suddenly fell as though a pit hole had appeared at its bottom. Then, a massive mountain of blue shot up.\nBeneath the towering wave of water, Leonel could faintly catch a glimpse of beautiful, reflective blue scales.\nWithout hesitation, he pulled out his pistol, shooting a single normal shot. He thought that this would be all he needed to end things. But the result was far outside of his expectations.\nDING!\nLeonel's shot didn't even leave a dent. It rebounded off, causing Leonel to look in shock as his shot landed on a nearby patch of grass, burrowing into the soil.\nAfter a moment, Leonel smirked.\n'Well, good thing I picked that beast in particular.'\nThe massive scaled creature fell back into the waters, causing waves to flood over the sides toward Leonel. However, he didn't move, weathering the storm.\n\"… What is he doing?\"\nThis was a question many of the youths were asking each other. Why was he standing in such a dangerous place? It should be obvious that normal methods weren't enough now.\nKKKKKKKUUUUUAAAAAAAAAA!!\n'There it is.'\nLeonel's gaze gew focused. This was exactly what he was looking for.\n'Don't blame me.' Leonel grinned to himself. 'I've lost count of the number of times I've gotten fish bones caught in my throat. Consider this a little payback.'\nThe rage of the massive beast shook the river. Leonel could imagine its pain. That deer he had fed it was no joke. Leonel had defeated it easily, but after testing the strength of its sharp antlers, the result shocked even him.\nOne could imagine the damage it could do inside that creature's stomach.\nHowever, this wasn't all Leonel wanted. He was still biding his time, still waiting.\nBy now, the other youths realized that Leonel had done something. As for whatever it was, it was clear that it was very effective.\n'There it is!'\nThe creature surged up once again, doing whatever it could think of to try and alleviate the pain it was suffering.\nAt that moment, Leonel did the unthinkable and jumped into the air with it.",

      "content": "Leonel surged toward the towering beast.\nWith his improvement to his treasure shoes, even without activating its formation, his leaping ability was now beyond the realms of reason. Even jumping 20 to 30 meters into the air was no longer impossible. In a flash, he had already appeared above the creature, his palms flipping over to reveal two pistols.\n??\n'Wow…'\nDespite the fact his goal was to kill this creature, Leonel couldn't help but hesitate in the last moment. It was simply too much of a work of art. Before the Metamorphosis, seeing such a beautiful creature was too difficult. Or, even if they did exist, they were on a much smaller scale than this.\nHe could immediately tell that this creature was some kind of mutated coy fish. Its scales were various shades of blue, varying from what was almost a deep black to a sky blue. Its fins shot through the air almost like a pair of wings and its tail fin, especially, flowed almost like the hair of a gorgeous woman.\nIf there were any hardcore environmentalists here, there was no doubt they'd rip him apart for even daring to have thoughts on such a creature. But, at this point, the dye had been cast. If he didn't shoot not, he would be the one in danger.\n'Sorry big guy.'\nLeonel fired a series of shots, unrestrainingly concentrating his shot on the eyes of blue coy fish.\nKKKKUUUUUUUAAAAAAAA!!!\nThe bullets of white left spiraling trails of spinning wind in their wake, tearing a path through the raining water that shed reflective droplets in every which direction.\nThe damage was undeniable. A spray of violet blood leaked from the blue coy's eyes as it body tried to flop back down to the river. But, would Leonel allow this?\nA layer of green enveloped Leonel's right sole. He launched himself forward, sending a strong kick toward the massive fish that knocked it toward the land.\nWithout pausing, the sole of his other shoe lit, stopping his rebounding force and sending him back toward the shore.\nLeonel thought it would all be over at this point. A fish out of water, no matter how large it was, was just a fish out of water. It was self explanatory. In fact, it was even more exaggerated considering how injured it was now.\nBut, Leonel had forgotten to consider one important thing. Just what was this coy fish's ability?\nJust when the blue scaled coy fish was about to land on solid ground. A shocking change took place.\nIt took a dive as though it was going into water.\nAt first, Leonel thought that this was simply because it was blinded. Maybe it was in so much pain that it hadn't even registered the fact Leonel had just kicked it. But in the next moment, Leonel was left speechless.\nThe ground the coy fish should have landed against suddenly became as fluid as water. No… That wasn't it. It had actually become water!\nLeonel could only watch as what once was solid land suddenly became a lake. And then, as the fish rampaged, completely blind to its surroundings, it became a winding river.\nSuddenly, everything made sense. The odd structure of this island, the seemingly fantastical ways lakes and rivers appeared, the random and impossible to explain waterfalls… It was all the doing of this fish!\nLeonel's eyes widened, realizing that blinding this beast was maybe one of the worst things he could have done. Now it was blind, in pain and enraged? On top of having such an ability?\n\"Run!\" Leonel roared.\nFrom start to finish, the youths of both Lookouts had been watching with shocked expressions. Leonel's actions seemed to get more and more wild with each passing moment.\nLeonel fell through the air. The process was completely out of his control. He had already used both platform jumps of his treasure shoes, and though he had improved them greatly, the cool down time was still 30 seconds.\nWhere the was dry land below him before, there was suddenly a vast and steadily growing lake. Well, maybe calling it a lake wasn't accurate because the erratic movements of the coy fish made it look like a toddler had randomly scribbled onto a page.\nHowever, Leonel wasn't worried. If it was before, he would fear a battle on the water. But, after he observed Old Hutch's use of Force, he was able to glide on the surface of the lake.\nAs far as he knew, there were no Invalids on this island. Maybe they had already been weeded out by the beasts or maybe they taken out by the overseers of Project Hunt. Even if this wasn't the case, the Invalids who would appear here would all be beast types, so they wouldn't be interested in Leonel to begin with. So, he wasn't shy with using his Force at all.\nLeonel landed heavily on the surging waves below, his body sinking in to the point his hip were submerged before the bouyancy of his Force sent him shooting back up.\n'This is difficult.' Leonel thought, his jaw clenched.\nHe had used this ability to run from the boat that brought him here to the island. But, back then, the ocean had been fairly calm. He hadn't thought that it would be so much more difficult when the water was agitated.\n'I need to end this quickly with a Light Elemental shot…'\nHad Leonel not been too conservative in his approach before, he most definitely could have ended this earlier. But, it was impossible, even for him, to predict everything.\n\"Haha! Dealing with such a beast is what I'm built for!\"\nAt that moment, the quiet and stoic King of Seas suddenly became a totally different person, charging forward in his brass speedo with trident in hand.\nLeonel frowned but he didn't say much. If there were others with water abilities, it really could be useful. Those without them had already heeded his advice and retreated by a long measure. The only exceptions were those who were seemingly able to use Force just like him.\n'The Slayer Legion has Force users…?'\nLeonel felt that maybe he had to reevaluate this group of rebels again.\nWhile his mind was half wandering, half focusing on the battle before them, their movements had caught the attention of the beast toward the center of the island. Their intelligent eyes flickered with a peculiar light.",

      "content": "Leonel's eyes madly scanned the body of water beneath him. Since his Internal Sight was so limited upon entering liquids, his best reliance was his eyes.\nThough it was true that this coy fish's ability was troublesome, there were some benefits to it as well. For example, the bodies of water it created were perfectly clear and without impurities, making it much easier to see through. The only thing that could disrupt Leonel's vision was the agitated water. But, wasn't this agitation perfect for telling exactly where that massive fish was?\nAt that moment, King of Seas soared into the air, diving down. Leonel faintly caught the sight of his skin growing greenish blue scales just before he entered the water.\nLeonel didn't stop him. With such an ability, King of Seas was indeed a good candidate for taking the vanguard. The trouble was that Leonel was certain this fish was far stronger than King of Seas judging by his stats.\nHowever, King of Seas had two advantages. Firstly, Leonel had already blinded the coy fish. And, secondly, Leonel had yet to get a clean look at his stats after his transformation. It was possible that Leonel had underestimated him.\nPisces shot a look toward Flowing Wind. But, after a brief communication with their eyes, the latter shook her head no.\nPisces immediately understood. It seemed that Flowing Wind's scouting ability was useless in the water. After confirming this, she shot forward along the green grass while Flowing Wind rose into the air, stepping on the wind as though it was solid ground.\nAs though not to be outdone, Chasing Wind soared into the air as well, followed quickly by Thunderous Clap.\nRoaring Black Lion hesitated for a moment, but chose to stay back. That said… It didn't mean he would do nothing. He quickly morphed into his humanoid beast form, filling his chest with air and billowing out with a roar that shook the surroundings.\nLeonel had been right. Roaring Black Lion's ability wasn't as simple as a transformation and a strength boost. He had a suppression ability he called King of Beasts. Though it worked on humans, it was especially effective on animals and had much more room to grow.\nIn this sort of situation, even though he couldn't partake in the fight directly, his role was still invaluable.\nAfter his roar, the wild movements of the coy fish slowed considerably, allowing King of Seas to catch up and land a resounding strike with his trident to its side.\nA tornado of water blasted forward, sending the coy fish upward with an unquenchable momentum.\nPisces reacted quickly. Droplets of water seemed to form around her like sparkling lights as her dress and hair fluttered. Though she could be looked down upon for actually wearing a dress to such an occasion, one could only admit that she looked amazing doing it.\nFlowing Wind and Chasing Wind reacted at that instant as well, causing the wind in the surroundings to kick up a storm that fused in the rising tornado of water.\nKKKKUUUUUUUUUAAA!!!\nThe coy fish shot higher and higher into the air, unable to extricate itself. It was completely helpless.\n\"HAHA! This kill will be mine, King of Seas!\"\nKing of Seas controlled the water around him, forming a miniature tornado of his own to shoot into the skies after the coy fish.\nWhen he appeared, many couldn't help but be stunned.\nGreenish blue scales covered him from head to toe. Odd fish-like membranes snapped closed and open over his eyelids. Fins jetted out the side of his face and webbing coated the distance between his fingers and toes. Anyway you looked at him, he was a fishman of legend.\nHe grinned a savage, jagged grin, a sharp row of teeth shimmering beneath the sunlight as he soared into the air.\nPulling his trident back, he mustered all his strength, using the water tornado beneath him to propel him forward and bring more power to his strike.\nHe could almost see it. The sight of the fish being skewered.\nWhenever he activated his ability and entered this form, his blood would boil. As though he had a long lineage of Ancestors who lived for battle and blood, an excitement the dug deep into his bones would take hold of him. Because of this, a young man who was usually quiet and stoic would now have these outbursts where he had to kill. His trident needed to taste blood or else he wouldn't rest.\nWho knew that in all his confidence, his trident would rebound off of the coy fish's scales as though he had smashed into a steel plate?\nHis savage expression changed as a jarring pain assault his arm. The rebound force was so strong that he felt his shoulder almost dislocate completely. And, despite the fact it didn't, he could sense a few micro tears pulling at the muscles in his arms.\nThe coy fish was sent flying toward the ground again, but this time, no one seemed happy about it. They all knew what would happen. The ground would turn into a body of water once again, and who knew if they'd be able to catch that fish again?\nBut it was at that moment that a young man who had been doing nothing but scanning the lake's surface this whole time suddenly moved. It was too bad for this coy fish but… 30 seconds had passed.\nThe water beneath Leonel's feet bubbled as his Force surged into his legs.\nBANG!\nThe surface beneath his feet exploded as he launched himself into the air. Due to losing some of the momentum, he only managed to jump ten meters, but to Leonel, he felt that this was more than enough.\nThe moment he felt his momentum faltering, another green light blossomed beneath his sole. This time, he jumped over 20 meters, appearing above the flopping fish, two pistols in hand.\nHe didn't hold back this time around. Both pistols were outfitted with a bullet that jetted out from the nozzle like an arrow. In fact, instead of calling it a bullet, it would be more appropriate to call these loaded pistols harpoons.\nIf it was a regular shot, Leonel could shoot 20 to 30 times. If it was a Light Elemental Force shot, Leonel could shoot two to three times. But, if it was this harpoon modified from his darts… he could only shoot once.\nThere was a good reason for that.\nBANG!\nKKUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!\nThe coy fish flopped to the ground with a resounding boom. But, this time, there was no new lake or river to speak of.",

      "content": "Leonel landed on the coy fish, exhaling a long breath. At the same time, a bit of fear couldn't help but creep into his heart as well as a bit of anticipation. This coy fish's ability was really too sinister. If he had been fighting alone, it could be said that he would have had a much harder time even if it ended in his victory. As for why he was filled with anticipation, it was of course because if he could refine the ability into a treasure, the potential applications were tantalizing.\nLeonel most wanted this ability for its application in escape. He could tell that the coy fish wasn't creating water, but was instead transforming earth into water. If this was a treasure instead of an ability and it was tweaked a bit, wouldn't it be possible to escape through the ground?\nThere was another type treasure Leonel was thinking of making, but for now, he lacked the skill. Of course, he hadn't forgotten about Xinghai. If he could turn Xinghai's 'blink' ability into a treasure, his combat prowess would take another leap. But, Leonel neither had the necessary materials, nor the skill to do anything with this idea.\nAny such treasure would be of, at the very least, the Quasi Bronze Grade. Obviously, this was beyond him.\nLeonel sighed, looking at the pistols in his hands. The nozzles had exploded from the inside out, leaving them useless. Unfortunately, now was definitely not the best time to repair them, so he could only continue from here with eight nozzles remaining.\nAfter putting them away, Leonel made his way to the wound in the coy fish's eye and coated his arm in Force. Reaching inside and relying on his Internal Sight, he was able to dig out the beast crystal with ease.\nThe beast crystal looked like a smooth blue pearl, emitting a faint watery smell. The kind one would experience by a freshwater lakeside.\n\"What do you think you're doing?\"\nLeonel frowned, turning back to see King of Seas looking toward him with an unfriendly gaze. He had already dismissed his ability transformation, but judging by the red in his eye,? he was still suffering from a bit of blood lust.\nIt was immediately obvious to Leonel that he was looking at the beast crystal in Leonel's hand. It was only now that Leonel remembered that to the other Promising Youths who had come with him, the Beast Crystals provided an opportunity to evolve their abilities.\nEven if Leonel discounted King of Seas, there was still Pisces as well. How could they not both want a Beast Crystal from such a powerful water-type creature?\nWhat Old Hutch had neglected to tell Leonel was that if one ingests a Beast Crystal from a creature with similar abilities, there's even the possibility of mutating and improving one's ability as well, making it even more desirable.\nThis beast was at least of the SS-grade in the eyes of these youths. Just how much would their abilities improve if they were to ingest it?\nKing of Seas was especially looking forward to the potential defensive boost to his scales if he ingested it. Back then, his trident hadn't even left a scratch after his full powered attack.\nAs for Pisces, she was especially fond of the water transformation ability. As things stood now, she could only pull water vapor from the air when there were no other sources around.? This was the source of all those beautiful sparkles floating around her when she attacked.\nIf she was able to evolve her ability in this way, it could be said that she would instantly become one of the most powerful on Earth, let alone her generation.\nRegardless of who it was between them, it held lethal allure.\n\"Hey, you ungrateful bastards from Eastern Lookout. Indomitable got the final kill, don't you think you're a bit too shameless asking what he's doing? Obviously he's taking his spoils.\" Roaring Black Lion didn't back down even a step.\n\"Taking his spoils?\" Pisces asked indifferently. \"It was all seven of us who worked together to take down the fish, yet he didn't say a word before digging out the Beast Crystal himself. Even if he deserves the largest share, something that's still up for debate, he should at least discuss it with the rest of us, right?\"\nThose from the Southern Lookout frowned. What was up for debate? They all saw that King of Seas couldn't even scratch the beast's scales with his strongest strike. As for the rest of them, they only played a part in launching it into the air, something Leonel already proved would happen regardless as long as they were a bit more patient.\nIt could be argued that Leonel could have taken the beast out without help at all. The only reason those of the Southern Lookout stepped in was because they didn't want to remain idle while the Eastern Lookout youths acted.\nRoaring Black Lion sneered. \"Don't say I didn't warn you. He's not a person you can deal with just by ganging up like you did with me.\"\nFlowing Wind and Chasing Wind descended from the skies. Since Flowing Wind didn't need the Beast Crystal as he ability had nothing to do with water, she didn't join in. As far as she was concerned, this wasn't an Eastern versus Southern Lookout issue. This was purely a fight for benefits. There was nothing personal.\nShe felt no need to put herself in any potential danger for the sakes of King of Seas or Pisces even though they were teammates.\nToward Roaring Black Lion's words, Pisces and King of Seas sneered.\n\"Can't deal with just him?\" King of Seas laughed, the red in his eyes brightening a bit more.\nIf Leonel's guns hadn't broken right before their eyes, they might still fear him. But they all saw for themselves how they splintered and exploded. Of course a weapon capable of killing an SS-grade threat was enough to make them fear, but wasn't this weapon destroyed now?\nOf course, these two simply had no idea that Roaring Black Lion wasn't referring to Leonel's treasures at all. How could they know? By now, they had already assigned the loss of that Eastern Lookout group led by Ruptured Artery to Leonel's guns. Now that they were out of the picture, there was nothing to fear.\nLeonel scanned King of Seas and Pisces, his gaze expressionless.",

      "content": "The Leonel of the past might have really been surprised by this turn of events. In the world he was used to, even if people held such greed in their hearts, they wouldn't display it so openly. But, after his run-in with Thunderous Clap, he had already come to accept it. This was his new world now.\n\"I will be taking this Beast Crystal as it's useful to me. I'll also be taking a few of its scales and meat as well, but with a beast of this size, there's more than enough to go around for us all.\"\nLeonel said words he was planning on saying anyway before King of Seas spoke. If he really wanted to slight these people, he could easily take the entire beast into his Segmented Cube. With his strength and means, would any of them even be capable of stopping him from doing so?\nThe fact he hadn't was already an act of kindness.\nIn Leonel's mind, the most important thing to him now as getting back to Aina. In order to do so, he needed to have adequate strength. It was impossible to tell what might be going on on Terrain.\nWhen it came to matters related to Aina… He had no patience for nonsense, even if half that nonsense came from a beauty.\nA suffocating aura bloomed from Leonel's body.\nHe had never been able to control this aura, but whenever his emotions became especially focused, it involuntarily leaked.\nToward this change, it wasn't just King of Seas and Pisces that suddenly found it difficult to breathe. Even the youths from the Southern Lookout could only look toward Leonel with ghastly pale expressions.\nThey had never sensed such a thing from Leonel, and how could they? That day, Leonel had been so tired. How could he possibly focus his emotions? Had he been able to focus on the task at hand like he usually did, they would have long since been drowned out by his aura.\nIn that moment, the red in King of Seas' eyes completely retreated as though it had met something it feared.\nLeonel hadn't done a thing. He simply stood there and spoke. But, even if he told others that he wasn't purposely trying to suppress them, who would believe him?\nAll the youths from the Southern Lookout only looked toward Leonel with more fear. Could it be that he had really held back that day? Or had he really been tired? That hadn't been a joke?\nAfter realizing what was happening a flash of embarrassment and anger appeared on King of Seas' face. However, but he could do anything about it, what happened next left him stunned.\nThe very guns he thought were already broken were taken out by Leonel once again. They could only watch as he calmly twisted the broken nozzles off and replaced the? with new ones as though nothing had ever happened.\nKing of Seas and Pisces couldn't help but gulp.\nThis was already Leonel's final warning to them. If they really insisted on continuing, then he wouldn't mind teaching them a lesson. The last group that tried ended up in a tree for a few days, Leonel had no problem doing that again.\nThough there was now hesitation in the eyes of the two water ability users, Leonel could see that their resolve was slowly growing firmer.\nThis sort of opportunity, it came once in a lifetime. Most of the water ability beasts could only be found in the ocean, but who dared to venture into it? The waters were simply too dangerous and who knew what beasts evolved down there out of their control?\nIn addition, just being an aquatic beast didn't guarantee a water ability either, and even if it did, it was unlikely to be as good as the one in Leonel's hands right now.\nEven with all this being said, there was another, maybe even more important, reason they had to do this. This place was one where they would be the strongest. And, they could tell that Leonel wasn't comfortable with battling inside of water. If they tried to take this battle elsewhere, their strength would be greatly diminished.\nThere was no better place for them to battle than by all of this water.\nKKKKKKKRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!\nJust when everyone was preparing for battle, the sound of a raging beast came from the distance.\nLeonel's pupils shrunk. 'It's not just one beast.'\nBANG!\nAn explosion caused many of the youths present to feel their ears rupture and begin to bleed. At first, it was impossible to tell exactly where this explosion had come from and what had caused it. It was simply too loud. But, a moment later, a raging pillar of billowing white steam shot into the air in the distance.\nThe pillar was so thick and vibrant that it could be seen from over ten kilometers away with a clearness that made it feel as though it was right before them all.\n'Force?'\nLeonel's eyes widened. That pillar, he could feel it. It was a flood of Force with a level of density he couldn't fathom.\n'Is that the Force Crystal mine Old Hutch was talking about? Is it supposed to explode like that?'\nWorry began to bubble up in Leonel's heart. Before, he was freely using his Force because he was certain that there weren't any Invalids on this island. With his density of Force, the Invalids that could threaten him were too far away. Plus, they would all be creatures of another species, so they wouldn't bother with him either.\nBut, this density of Force was on another level. In addition, if it really came from the Force Crystal mine, that meant it didn't come from any one species and might very well attract creatures of all kind.\nIf this island was suddenly surrounded by an infestation of aquatic Invalids, what could they do? How the hell would they get out of this place?\nLeonel's blood ran cold.",

      "content": "Leonel was likely the first to realize the problem, but he most definitely wasn't the only one. In the recent battle, many of the youths had displayed some level of Force manipulation, whether small or big. There was no doubt they knew exactly what the geyser in the distance was.\n'This isn't good….'\nNot only would this geyser cause the island to be quickly surrounded by aquatic creatures, but there wasn't any guarantee that these creatures wouldn't come inland as well.? It was wishful thinking to hope that they wouldn't. Leonel had already learned that lesson once before.\n'The only way is to quickly stop that thing.'\nAfter making this decision, Leonel aimed his pistol at the fish corpse beneath his feet, powering it with lethal Light Elemental Force, and firing.\nHis sudden action caused many who had been paling under the stress of the sudden change of events to whip their heads toward him. However, by then, Leonel's purpose had already been accomplished.\nHe had perfectly aimed his shot toward a vulnerable point between the scales of the coy fish, causing them to bend at that point. Then, he reached down and pulled up with all his might, ripping the scales free from the dead beast's body.\nHe worked quickly. In what felt like the blink of an eye, he had already pulled off over ten beautiful blue scales, each of which was over a foot in length and about half of that in width.\nWhen he had about 20 in his possession, Leonel stopped, having stored them all within his spatial ring. Then, he looked off into the distance.\n\"If you all want to survive this, I suggest we put aside petty disputes for now and head over there. If we don't stop it, we're finished.\"\nLeonel's calm voice had a magnetic appeal to the youths around him. They couldn't help but instinctively want to listen.\n\"Going over there? Are you insane?\"\nOf course… How could everyone be of one mind. Where there were those with one thought, there would always be those with the opposing. This was just the way of the world, the way things worked.\nThe person who spoke was none other than Ruptured Artery. Despite his history with Leonel, he hadn't spoken out of spite. Instead, he spoke on instinct. How could that place not be dangerous.\nThis coy fish was the very first SS-grade threat they had ever met, and they all very clearly realized that they couldn't do anything to it. If it wasn't for Leonel, they would have forever been unable to cross this region toward the center of the island.\nKnowing this, it was obvious to them that there was likely more than one such creature like this here. And, this also explained the scarcity of beasts as well. If they linked all of these points together… there was most definitely a hoard of dangerous beasts maybe no less powerful than the fish beneath Leonel's feet ahead.\nAfter thinking to this point, how could they possibly dare to continue forward? The best choice was to wait for their overseeing Commander to come back and retrieve them.\n\"I will only say a few more words to convince you. If they fall on deaf ears, I won't be responsible for what happens to you after this.\n\"One, you're not the only one's in danger. Your Commanders, waiting off shore for you all, are in even more danger than we are. There's nowhere to hide on the open ocean.\"\nLeonel had hardly begun when the youths turned several shades more pale. Having thoughts that their Commanders were infallible would be utterly stupid. The Metamorphosis just began. Even though higher ranking officials could be said to have far greater combat experience than them as youths, the truth was that there wasn't a large power disparity between them and their Commanders.\nThere were very few exceptions to this. Geniuses like Old Hutch who could make progress even in a Third Dimensional world, then explode with all their potential now were incredibly rare. Simply put, there were most definitely no such people amongst the Commanders.\n\"Second, time is of the essence. Even if the Commanders could deal with the initial wave, could they survive a second, a third, a fourth? If you want any hope of making it off this island, the quicker the geyser is dealt with, the better.\n\"And third… you really don't have much of a choice.\"\nLeonel looked into the distance with a solemn expression. The direction he was looking at was surprising. In fact, he was looking toward the complete opposite direction of the Force geyser.\nThe dense forest of trees began to rumble and quake.\nFirst, it was subtle. It was an ever so slight swaying of the grass or rustling of the leaves. Then, it felt as though the ground itself was trembling. Soon, even the thick trees themselves began to swing to and fro as though made of rubber.\nThe Promising Youths looked toward their backs with an eerie cold permeating their hearts.\nThey suddenly understood what Leonel meant. Though the number of beasts in the forest was less than they imagined there would be, there were still many there. It was enough for Leonel to have killed over 20 in just his first few moments on this island. Even if the number was lacking… If they were all to converge on this point…\nThey really didn't have a choice but to continue forward. If they tried to fight against the tide of beasts… wouldn't they be swallowed whole before even realizing what happened?\nHaving said what he needed to say, Leonel didn't hesitate to dash into the distance toward the geyser, thinking to himself that he most definitely needed a treasure capable of transportation soon. But unfortunately, that would require crafting something much larger than he ever had before.\nIn Force Crafting, difficulty wasn't just decided by the overall grade of the treasure, but also the size of it. A craft that was extremely small or large was definitely much harder to craft even compared to a craft several levels higher in grade.\nHowever, now wasn't the time to think about such things. Leonel could only lament his bad luck. This was supposed to be an easy trial he could place first in with a minimum amount of effort. Why had it suddenly become a life or death situation?\nSomething about all of this felt off. Things weren't so simple as they seemed.",

      "content": "Leonel crossed lake after lake and river after river. He knew that the youths were quickly following behind him, hoping to put some distance between them and the beast hoard coming from the dense forests.\nThe wild, thunderous roars and booming tremors seemed to be getting closer and closer.\nLeonel's Internal Sight remained vigilant, but his expression was only growing more and more solemn. He noticed that his senses were growing less sharp. It was almost as though something was interfering with his ability to see the whole picture clearly.\n'It must be the increased density of Force, or maybe its the fact that Force is so unrestrained and volatile…'\nLeonel didn't have a perfect answer, but this was his best guess. However, he didn't get a chance to think of any more examples because his footsteps suddenly came to a grinding halt.\nHis heels dug into the ground in an exaggerated manner, it was to the point he almost fell backward.\nJust now, he had reached the top of the largest hill in this stretch of land, only to find a sight that his heart plummet.\nThough this was an island with a relatively circular shape, there was just a single path toward the center of it. This was precisely why the actions of the blue coy fish had stalled the youths for so long. With it taking control of the single path forward, they had to either find a way to bypass it or kill it the very same way Leonel had.\nThe reason that there was just this singular path was because entrances from all other angles were flooded with deep valleys that seemingly had no entry points. Together, they became deep pits with unfathomable depths.\nFlowing Wind and Chasing Wind had already considered the idea of simply flying over these valleys. But, for whatever reason, that still ended in failure. As for exactly why, maybe only those two women knew.\nAt this moment, those valleys became those eerie death pits once more, trapping them. The trouble was that they weren't trapping them outside, but rather, inside this time around…\nHowever, just this alone didn't warrant this reaction from Leonel. He had already known about the deep valleys that blocked the path to the center of the island. After all, he had been here for half a month, how could he not think of venturing further in to find more targets?\nThe trouble was that his path had been blocked. He wasn't omnipotent, nor had he reached the point of being able to cover the island completely with his Internal Sight. As such, just like the other youths, he had to slowly explore the island, trying to find another entrance in.\nIt was then that he was lucky enough to run into Erupting Volcano and was able to learn that it was precisely because this one entry point faced the location the Eastern Lookout youths entered the island that they were able to find it first, followed by those of the Southern Lookout.\nSo, why was all this important? Why was it that Leonel was frozen in place, even to the point of becoming an anchor that stopped the youths from moving forward any longer? …\nIt was because the moment he reached the top of the hill, he saw an army.\nOne shouldn't mistake these words to mean that a group of humans were below. No. Each and every one of those 'soldiers' in Leonel's line of sight were beasts.\nThey were separated by their species. One group of a few dozen was led by large bear that stood at over five meters tall with brownish gold fur. Another was led by a tiger no smaller than the bear, except its stripes were a bright red-gold instead of the normal black. Yet another was led by a snake over ten meters long, covered in black scales…\nAs if these three weren't imposing enough, there was still another three.\nThere was a spider with vicious steel incisors and countless beady red eyes. Its size was the smallest at just three meters in length, but such a thing hardly stopped its grotesque visage from displaying its full might.\nThe next was a lemur, a monkey like creature with a zebra striped tail. It was far larger than it should have been, standing no shorter than the red-gold striped tiger…\nHowever the last was maybe the most shocking of all. It didn't seem to be a beast at all. Or rather, it was, but had been stripped of all its flesh. It stood on all fours not much unlike an ape would. From head to toe, it was nothing but bone.\nIts body was covered in a faint transparent light that seemed to reflect the vision of an armor, but it would often flicker and disappear as though lacking the ability to maintain its own form.\nThese six creatures were easily the most powerful. However, what truly shocked Leonel were the orderly 'soldiers' to their backs.\nEach of them had a troop of their own, neatly arranged as though they truly were an army of humans rather than beasts. Each took control of their own species, wielding absolute authority.\nThe golden brown bear had a troop of bears. The red-gold striped tiger had a legion of tigers. The black-scaled snake's troop filled the air with endless hissing… Each had their own centers of power. Even the bone ape had a legion of apes, though their flesh and blood was intact.\nLeonel quickly tried to calm his breathing. However, any hopes he had of not being noticed had already long since been thrown out the window. The instant he had made it to the top of the hill, he found six pairs of eyes trained on him.\nThe bestial, murderous intent made it feel as though a bucket of ice water had fallen onto his head. His heart beat involuntarily slowed.\nAt that moment, the brownish gold bear roared and turned its head toward the spider legion. To Leonel's dismay, the spider's numerous beady red eyes landed on him once again, its mandibles snapping together in what looked like a response.",

      "content": "The youths who charged forward with Leonel paled. Their legs grew weak to the point some of them all but collapsed. There was even a good portion of them that wanted to turn and run this very moment. But, when they thought about the horde of beasts to their back, they realized that there really was no place to go.\nWere they really finished? Just like this?\nSome of them were here for a chance to enter an SS-grade Zone. Now that they thought about it, just how foolish were they? A single SS-grade threat like the coy fish had stumped them for so many days already until Leonel came, wasn't it too much of a joke to be striving for such a quota?\nThe more they thought like this, the more they disparaged themselves, and the greater their fear grew.\nIn the distance, the horde of spiders was swiftly moving forward, their eight limbs shimmering beneath the sunlight and slicing through the wind. They could only imagine what it would feel like being pierced by one of those things… How horrible would their deaths be…?\nThough these youths were part of the Slayer Legion, their childhood's weren't much different from Leonel's. Fights between the Empire and the rebels were much rarer in those days compared to after the Metamorphosis. It could only be said that they were marginally more prepared than other youths since they received military training.\nBut now… they froze up. Facing a beast one on one was one thing, but suddenly facing over a hundred charging forward like this made them feel as though their lives were already finished. This would really be their last day on this Earth.\n\"Hey!\"\nLeonel suddenly roared, shocking them out of their thoughts. His voice was so loud that it traveled over a mile, even overshadowing the rushing sound of Force surging out from the geyser up ahead.\n\"If you don't want to die, pull yourselves together! You see over there, there's a network of caves. Our goal is to cut through here and make it there. Then we might stand a chance. I'll take the vanguard, don't lose sight of my back!\"\nThey all saw what Leonel was pointing toward.\nAfter the rolling hills of green the blue coy fish had called home, the land suddenly became bleak and desolate, filled with grayish black gravel-like land. This bleak land was connected to the valley system that blocked their entrance from other regions. Without any context, it looked no different from a land of death.\nNearer toward the center of this land of death, there was another hill. Though this hill wasn't as tall, it was very wide. It was made completely of dull grayish black stone and had numerous holes of varying sizes dotted across its surface. In truth, it was more accurately described as a hive rather than a hill.\nThe geyser of Force, still jetting out into the skies, came out from this very hive, out of a hole at the very center of it all. Leonel could also tell that the origin of this geyser was incredibly deep underground.\nThinking of the deep valley system, Leonel couldn't help but think that they were connected in some way. But, even though he intuitively felt this, he didn't have the time to put his brain power toward trying to figure it out. The spider legion was already closing in. In the beginning, they were over half a kilometer away, but now, they were already less than half of that.\n'We have the high ground right now, but trying to maintain this position is stupid. Those beasts seem to have intelligence, so if they see that the spider legion is losing, they won't just sit idly by.\n'The good news is that they only sent one of the six groups after us, leaving a gap in their defenses we can take advantage of. The bad news is that we still need to make it through the spider legion and those other five legions if we want to seek refuge in that hive.'\nLeonel gritted his teeth. He knew they needed to charge, there was no other way.\nThe truth was that turning back to pierce through the horde of beasts toward their backs would be easier. They had far less organization and would definitely be weaker than this threat up ahead. But, if they did that… then what?\nThere were definitely even more beasts headed here from the ocean, having sensed the surge of Force. If they couldn't deal with this problem in front of them, they would be finished.\nLeonel flipped his palm, a familiar spear appearing in his hand. Compared to the last time when its spearhead had been split by Hutch's blade, it had already been repaired.\nHow could he come here without first comprehending Spear Force? After Leonel did this, the dictionary unlocked a lot of information about the Spear Domain ring for him. There were many useful things, but what was most important to him now was the fact that spears acknowledged by the ring can be repaired!\nUnfortunately, he had left the primitive man's spear outside for too long, causing its consciousness to dissipate. As a result, the ring no longer acknowledged it and was unable to repair it. But, this primitive woman's spear was different. Not as much time had passed and since it was just a low level spear of the Spear Domain, it didn't even take an hour to repair fully.\nLeonel's aura completely changed, becoming even sharper and more violent than before.\nSeeing this, the youths inexplicably felt a sense of calm. Before, when the aura was aimed toward them, they found it difficult to even breathe. But now, having experienced the aura of protection Leonel's teammates had for so many years already, they suddenly felt their strength surging.\nLeonel took out the dictionary and slipped it into his pocket. With the situation like this, he couldn't afford to keep it hidden any longer.\n\"What's the weakness of that spider king?\"\nLeonel's sudden words caught the youths who had just regained their bearing off guard once again. But, they were even more shocked when there was an actual response.\n[ *Ping* Replying to Seed, the seam between the head and body is a vital point. ]\nLeonel didn't even turn back after hearing this.\n\"Follow me, I'll carve out a path.\"\nHe could feel his blood boiling. He understood that this was his true state. The state his Lineage Factor was meant to be in.",

'I haven't gotten back to Aina yet, I have no intention of dying in this place.'\n\"I'm sure you all heard that.\" Leonel said without turning back. \"Aim well.\"\nLeonel dashed forward, his speed so swift that it almost looked like his feet weren't touching the ground.\nTo his back, the youths clenched their jaws. By now, in the chaos of the moment, those of the Eastern and Southern Lookouts didn't have the luxury of continuing to remain separated.\nKing of Seas and Pisces were still fuming over what happened earlier, but did they have much of a choice? If they didn't band together now, wouldn't their slim chance at survival become even slimmer than it already was?\nStill, despite the situation, those of the Southern Lookout had complicated feelings of their own. They couldn't help but feel odd about Leonel's actions to this point. Wasn't he supposed to be arrogant and insufferable?\nSomeone with those kinds of personality traits would probably use their superior power to force them to act as meat shields. If it came down to it, and Leonel forced them to take the vanguard, would they even be able to say no? Where would they go? Without a pillar of support like Leonel, what were their odds of survival?\nLeonel crossed the last line of grass and stepped onto the gravel-like land of death. To him, it simply didn't matter whether those to his back followed him or not. He was a person with a soft heart. This was precisely why he had taken on the role of their vanguard. However, it was impossible for him to put himself in anymore danger should they choose to hesitate.\nThe loose land beneath his feet was kicked up into the air as his hair whipped about wildly. There was something freeing knowing that all of his opponents were just beasts, as though an inhibition on his heart had been removed and he could finally let loose.\nAt that moment, a familiar roar sounded behind Leonel, causing his lip to curl into a more prominent smile. It seemed that they had finally decided to follow.\n'[Call of the Wind]'\nThe ease with which Leonel used this technique simply couldn't be compared to the first time he had done so. It looked as though he had only casually flicked his wrist a few times, yet several lines of white curled in the air, finding the gap between the head and thorax of several spiders in the blink of an eye.\nLeonel could at most use this technique a few times in the past. But now, using it over a hundred wasn't an issue. Before he had even met the frontline of the charging legion, almost a dozen large spiders had already fallen, their mandibles chopping at empty air.\n'As expected, the smaller ones have the same weakness as the larger one…'\nHow could all of these spiders be of the same sub species? Things would never be so convenient. Let alone this spider legion, even the legion of the tiger and bear weren't completely homogenous.\nBut, what stood true was that like converged with like. The spider legion was mostly made up of? various mutated arachnids and different kinds of insects. The tiger legion was most constructed of large cat-like beast. So on and so forth…\nNow that Leonel had a firm grasp of their weakness, he wouldn't allow them to stop his path forward. Especially not now that he had support coming to his back.\nIn another few strides, Leonel had met the spider legion. The youths charging closely to his back couldn't help but be shocked by his dauntlessness. But, if they knew that Leonel first trial in this world was facing an army of Spaniards with no weapon outside of a bicycle… they would think much differently.\nThis fearlessness, this dauntlessness, the firmness of his stride and the straightness of his back… he had earned them all with his blood, sweat and tears.\nLeonel's movements became ethereal, his steps carrying a bit of the elegance of the primitive woman. As devastating as [Call of the Wind] was in the long range, in the short range, it was even more so.\nLeonel carved a path, sliding past the sharp legs and chomping pincers of insects and spiders around him.\nIf all he had to do was make it past, he would have long since stepped through the air. However, he held his ground firmly, every pierce of his spear reaping another life.\nSuddenly Leonel took his left hand off the staff of his spear, flipping his palm to reveal his pistol.\nHis hips spun as he fired a single shot.\nIn the distance, Precious Moment had fallen. She scrambled to pull back, ignoring the hard gravel scraping across her palms and bottom as she hurried back. The mandibles of a mantis-like creature snapped toward her, not caring for the tears and snot running down her face.\n\"Emilia!\"\nSeer roared from a battle to her side, but he knew he wouldn't make it in time. Disregarding himself, he pointed his staff toward the mantis, blowing it away. But, before he could sigh in relief, he realized the spider he had been fighting was now free to attack him.\nA leg glistening like steel shot toward his chest. He could almost see the scene of his chest being pierced right through.\nHowever, he could have never expected a single shot to find its mark at that very moment.\nThe spider had hardly raised its legs before it fell limply to the ground, unable to get up again.\nSeer looked toward the direction of the shot, only to find Leonel's back looking back at him. A feeling of gratefulness welled up in his chest.\n'He fired that shot even before I saved Emilia… Just how did he predict what would happen…?'\nUnfortunately, this wasn't the time for him to ask this question, because his savior was facing his own problems now. After seeing Leonel take out so much of its own, the spider king which had been taking a backseat suddenly couldn't any longer.\nLeonel's jaw steeled. \"Give me a rundown of this spider's abilities.\"",

He had been very worried about the webs of these spiders when he charged, but he didn't expect that the matter would be even more troublesome than he originally thought.\nTo make matters worse, this still wasn't considered an SS-grade threat? Tier 7 Black, that translated to S-grade. But, what was with the 'Elite' tag, what did that mean? Now that he thought about it, Leonel remembered that the octopus was classified as Peak Tier 7 Black. So there were separations like this?\nNo matter how curious he was, Leonel knew that this wasn't a time to ask this question. All he needed to guess was that this spider was a greater threat than the octopus. Knowing this, he had to ask questions that could help him keep his life.\n\"Can my chain necklace block the toxicity?\"\n[ *Ping* Replying to Seed, the energy shield can block about 80% of the venom's toxicity. ]\nLeonel's frown deepened, but his footsteps didn't stop.\nHe dashed toward the spider, but when it seemed they would clash, he suddenly changed directions, headed off to the side with all the might he could muster. He knew that the spider would chase after him because all along the way, his spear had never stopped. He continued carving a path forward, out pacing the spider by a measure.\nLeonel could tell by the spider's stats that its speed was actually much higher than his own. However, it's agility was very low. Making it navigate a battlefield like this, especially when it had to be careful not to poison its own legion, was about the best thing Leonel could do at this moment.\n\"Is there no other way to deal with the spider's venom?\"\nLeonel knew he needed to be incredibly specific when asking questions to the dictionary. It wouldn't simply offer him up answers based on the situation. So, Leonel had slowly learned to keep an open mind and ask things he might not usually ask.\nIn his mind, he didn't have anything else that could deal with venom. But who knows if this was really true?\nOutside of his expectations, it seemed he was correct to ask.\n[ *Ping* Light Elemental Force has a strong healing effect and is the bane of many toxins. Seed's Light Elemental Force is still too low to be considered immune. ]\nLeonel's eyes widened. \"Too low? There are levels to Light Elemental Force?\"\nLeonel really didn't expect this. He thought that a Force Strengthening Deviation was as advertised. He didn't expect for there to be more.\n[ *Ping* Yes.]\nEven in the midst of the battlefield, Leonel couldn't help but curse under his breath. Couldn't this damned dictionary be a bit more forgiving? Why did every answer need to be so short and to the point. It really never touched on anything he didn't directly ask it, Leonel couldn't help but wonder how many things he had missed out on because of this.\n'Forget it, now isn't the time to ask this. That damned spider is hot on my heels.'\nLeonel knew he couldn't put too much effort into running away from this spider. Though he felt he could escape on his own, he was meant to be acting as a vanguard currently. If he strayed too far, instead of opening up a path, he would be allowing the other youths to get swallowed up.\nThe youths who had come to this Hunt still number about 80 or so. With such a number, even though they were still vastly outnumbered, it was definitely better than going in alone. Leonel needed them as much as he didn't have the heart to leave them here to die.\nSo, he could only hope that the combination of his Light Elemental Force and his energy shield was enough to hold out.\nLeonel's spear flickered forward, leaving after images in the air as he pierced another spider through. Compared to the massive three meter long spider to his back, the ones before him were barely half a meter long. But, were still far larger than what one would expect.\nThe gross creatures sent a chill up even Leonel's spine, but he still pushed them down his spear like a kabob before turning back and whipping them toward the quickly approaching spider.\nCHIIIIIIIIIIIICHIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!\nThe spider leader's leg lashed out, slicing the soaring corpses in half with a single strike and causing a rain of green guts to fall from the sky.\nIn that moment, its vision was obscured, allowing Leonel to rapidly close the distance.\nLeonel ducked down and slid across the grey gravel, trying to get beneath the spider's body to attack its weak point. But, just as he was going to succeed, the spider leader seemed to realize that something was off.\nIts mouth opened, its mandible-like protrusions snapping as a violet fog fell from its mouth.\nLeonel quickly held his breath, explosively retreating.\n'Damned dictionary. It said venomous touch, it never said anything about venomous fog.'\nAt that moment, a white strand of silk shot out like a bullet. No, it wasn't completely white. Beneath the sunlight, it reflected a slight hint of fluorescent purple. It was so subtle that even with his senses, Leonel almost didn't catch it.\nLeonel immediately recognized that this was the spider's true ability, he had wrongly accused the dictionary this time. Venomous Touch was described as a venom infused into every fiber of the spider's being… that would include its breath!\n'Damn…'\nLeonel rolled out of the way in a sorry state, just barely managing to dodge the bullet of silk. But, the insect beast behind him's cry of pain made it obvious that it wasn't so lucky.\nLeonel turned back to find it quickly turning purple, then black, then erupting into a cluster of dark fog and ash. If he didn't know better, he would think that it had been burned in a furnace…\nIt was now that Leonel suddenly realized that maybe the other five legions of beasts hadn't made a mistake just sending the spider king here.",

      "content": "Leonel's expression grew dignified.\nHe was reluctant to use his Light Elemental Force. It wasn't because he was trying to hide it, but because the consumption was too great. Not only did it drain his spirit, but it also drained his Force at a much faster rate. Though his Spear Force also had the same impact on him, it wasn't nearly as exaggerated. But, this also made sense since his Spear Force wasn't as powerful either.\nBut, at this point… What choice did he have?\nHONG!\nThe dull color of Leonel's eyes suddenly lit brightly, a blinding glow shooting out from within their depths.\n'Come on, you damned bug.'\nLeonel flashed forward, leaving a streak of gold in his wake. He looked like a shooting star streaking across the battlefield, catching the eye of several of the youths battling for their lives. Their blood couldn't help but boil watching Leonel face up against this spider king on his own.\nWas this his ability? They all seemed to have this thought.\nLeonel crossed into the foggy venom domain of the spider king, sending several piercing strikes forward at once.\nThe spider king's response wasn't slow. Its sharp steel-like legs deflected the first few as its mandibles chopped at Leonel.\nWhen it saw Leonel retreat out of the way, another streak of silk shot from its mouth, heading directly for him.\nShockingly, Leonel didn't dodge this time, facing the strike head on as a pistol appeared in his hand, already loaded with a dart.\nBANG!\nCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!\n\"Ugh…\"\nLeonel was sent flying. It felt as though the spider king's projectile was a javelin crashing into his chest.\nHis face turned red and bulged, only for a projectile of blood to fly from his mouth.\nThe enraged and pain filled roars of the spider caught the attention of the other legions of beasts, but they all hesitated to come forward. There was a reason they were still standing out side the large hill-like hive. They were waiting for the right opportunity to charge in and gain benefits for themselves, if they really left now, who knows what could happen?\nThese beasts were obviously not stupid. Since this place had such a large pull toward them, it obviously had a massive pull toward others. This was why they were standing in this position. But, despite having evolved, their thoughts were still relatively simple and straight forward. It was difficult for them to respond with great flexibility.\nBefore they could even make a decision, the situation changed again.\nThe rumbling of beasts that came from out of the forest suddenly sounded much closer. They could only look over to find hundreds of wild beasts charging over the hills, barreling through and crossing into the gravel filled lands.\nCompared to the beast legions with their respective kings, it was clear that these beasts had much less intelligence. Their tongues hung out from their mouths, a red tint coloring their eyes as though they had lost their minds. They wanted nothing more than to find the source of all this rich Force.\nAnother sharp crack rang out in Leonel's ears as he slid across the ground. He was very much familiar with this sound. He knew that his chain necklace had suffered another break.\nSweeping his Internal Sight over it, his expression somewhat paled. The first break had caused its efficacy to drop by 10%. This time around, the treasure only had 70% of its initial strength left.\nLeonel didn't even have a mind to care about his current situation. This treasure had saved his life too many times already. If it really broke completely, it would be too great of a loss to swallow.\nHe grit his teeth, glaring toward the screaming spider who seemed to not even have a mind to organize its own troops.\n'I should have pierced its brain with that strike, but maybe I was too optimistic. I don't know anything about the anatomy of a spider… or maybe it didn't pierce that deeply?'\nLeonel shook his head hard. \"RUN!\"\nHe snapped the youths who were too focused on battle out of it. They needed to take advantage of his beast tide to apply pressure on the other beast legions. If they were to get caught up in it, their last chance would go up in a puff of smoke.\nLeonel grit his teeth, ignoring the pain racking his body to stand.\nHe sent a glance across the battlefield, sighing a faint breath of relief when he saw that everyone had managed to barely keep some forward momentum and, most importantly, stay together.\nUnder Leonel's lead, they bolted toward the legion of beasts, their trail being followed by a tide of wild beasts. The spider legion didn't seem to know how to react with their leader screaming out and writhing in pain. They were soon swallowed by the beast tide.\nLeonel's heart almost beat out his chest with his every stride, once again swearing to himself that he would most definitely get some sort of transportation treasure.\nAs he ran, Leonel looked down at his chest with a solemn expression. A web spread out, covering half his chest and his shoulder. With every passing moment, it ate into his energy shield, causing the cracks across it to grow.\n'Dammit…'\nWithout a choice, Leonel took off his tight, black compression shirt before it could continue to corrode the energy shield. He coughed violently, unable to mind the state of his body as he ran.\nHe really couldn't believe it. He thought that by now, facing even an SSS-grade threat wouldn't put him in too sorry of a position. But now he had suddenly found out that there were still S-grade threats that could push him to this state. At a time like this, he couldn't help but lament that his ability was auxiliary and not attack based.\nLeonel shook his head as the distance between him and the five legions closed.\nHe once again heard Roaring Black Lion's roar sound out from his back. He didn't need to look back to know the beast tide had slowed somewhat because he could clearly see that even that beasts up ahead were greatly affected.\nLeonel didn't have the mind to care about anything else. All of his being was focused on charging through the gap left by the spider legion. He wouldn't let anything stop him.\nHis oppressive aura involuntarily shot out from his body, covering the lands before him in a layer of oppression.",

      "content": "Leonel controlled his speed. He was more than capable of leaving the trailing youths to his back far behind, but would doing this benefit him? If anything, it would put him in danger. Not only did he need to maintain their pace such that they were ahead of the beast tide, he needed to ensure they could also remain together.\nWith him in the lead, he perfectly took into account the speed and stamina stats of everyone. By now, any youth worthy of being part of this group had a complete set of stats above 1.00. This was more than enough to cross the remaining 400 or so meters in just half a minute.\nThey had already crossed half the distance before the legion of beasts couldn't sit idly any longer. Leonel didn't know why it was that they were still waiting, but what he was certain of was that they didn't want anyone entering before they did.\nThe brownish gold bear stepped forward, roaring as though giving a warning.\nThe beast tide behind the group of youths faltered for a moment, but it seemed that they had completely lost all reasoning.\nIt was clear that this fact completely enraged the brownish gold bear. He raised up onto his hind legs, billowing into the skies before slamming his front paws down.\nThe earth suddenly became turbulent. It seemed for a moment that nothing would happen, but then an earthen tide suddenly rose into the skies, causing Leonel's expression to change violently.\n'Earth control? This bear needs to die.'\nThe moment Leonel made the decision, he didn't hesitate.\nThe only chance for him and the youths with him to survive was to enter the hive network, making use of the network of tunnels to both hide and find a path toward the source of the Force geyser. However, if there was an earth controlling beast that entered into a network of tunnels with them… They wouldn't even know how they died.\nIf others heard Leonel's thoughts, they would think he was crazy. Though his line of thinking was correct, how could he possibly spare time for such a thing? Anyone else would focus on surviving this situation first, then worry about what came later, later.\nHowever, Leonel had been a star quarterback. Every move he made on the football field considered what might happen five, ten, even twenty plays later. Sometimes, it wasn't worth taking a victory if it guaranteed a loss later. Likewise, it was sometimes worth it to eat a loss for the sake of ultimately grasping victory.\nLooking at the compression shirt in his hand, Leonel's eyes flashed.\n\"Do your best to dodge!\" Leonel roared.\nThere was a limit to his abilities. While he could put himself on the line to deal with this beast, he couldn't also help them all dodge this attack. But, he wasn't worried. These were all promising youths for a reason.\nWithout hesitation, Leonel's speed suddenly doubled, then doubled again. He looked like a streak of light tearing across the graveled land, leaving a trail of dust in his wake.\nHe leapt over the three meter wall of earth with absolute ease.\nBy now, his distance from the bear king had already shrunk to 50 meters. At this point, he could even see the reflections in its large black eyes. He could sense its fury, its rage, its killing intent. But, his heart remained steady.\n40 meters. 30 meters. 20 meters.\n\"ROOOOOAAARRRR!!\"\nSeemingly worried about the coming beast tide, the bear king didn't force his legion to charge toward Leonel. Plus, in its mind… how could he possibly not be able to deal with a single human by itself?\nThe size difference was striking. The bear stood at over five meters tall, yet Leonel was barely two. Even the former's palm seemed capable of swatting him into a meat patty, but Leonel dauntlessly approached.\nAt that moment, the bear king seemed to sense Leonel's oppressive aura. Its rage had muddled its senses for a moment, but once Leonel came so close, it felt to him that hell had suddenly descended.\nThe bear was shocked for a moment, only to find that Leonel had suddenly appeared in the air above it, pointing a… black shirt at it?\nConfusion colored the bear's features. Why was this human pointing a piece of cloth at it?\nThe bear king's intelligence was just starting to develop, but the scene before it was completely baffling. It couldn't combine the threatening aura it felt from the human with the scene before it.\nFor the first time, a beast would pay a price for its rising intelligence. If it was still a normal bear, it wouldn't have hesitated to turn and run. It didn't have emotions like pride, it only had instincts of survival.\nBut, by now, it had grown the fondness for kingship. It had become intoxicated with power.\nIt had already sent the spider forward before, causing it to suffer a major setback. If it didn't step up now, the other beast kings would be disatisfied. This was his role to take on.\nBANG!\nThe moment it opened its mouth to roar its fear away, a searing pain ripped through its tongue and throat.\nAt first, it was the pain of having its flesh torn and pierced. But, in what felt like an instant, its vision grew blurry. It happened so quickly that the human that had been 'standing' in the air above it didn't even have time to land on the ground before its inner organs were completely corroded.\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath as the bear collapsed. He had known that the spider king's poison would be potent… but he most definitely didn't expect it to be so exaggerated. He couldn't help but feel a cold shiver run down his spine. If it wasn't for his chain necklace, he would be finished.\nAfter taking a look at the fourth nozzle he had completely ruined, Leonel sighed, landing on the ground heavily.\nWith a dull bang, the bear king fell to the ground.",

      "content": "The fall of the bear king was almost like flipping a switch. The shocked beasts suddenly began to release howls of rage. The beasts under the bear king's rule especially lost control, charging forward without regard for anything.\nBut… What shocked Leonel was the direction they charged. Instead of coming toward him like he had expected, they actually charged toward the Force geyser, leaving Leonel speechless.\nHe had thought that out of some sense of loyalty, these bear beasts would go all out and fight him to the death. But, it seemed that he had greatly overestimated them. Or, maybe he was just lacking in understanding.\nUltimately, these were wild beasts. They hadn't evolved to the point their thoughts were as meticulous as humans. Only the S-grade Elites among them were slightly better, but even then, that seemed to have as many downsides and upsides judging by the way the bear king died.\nIt was likely that even SSS-grade beasts couldn't match up to humans in intelligence. They might only be capable of doing so after entering the realms of the Fifth Dimension or higher.\nEither way, this was a good thing for Leonel. The path toward the hive now suddenly had two massive holes in it, and there was even a horde of bear creatures opening the path for him.\nTaking a look over his shoulder, he found that the youths had just about caught up during his battle. After a faint nod, he bolted forward, not having time to reprimand the Segmented Cube for sucking up the bear king's corpse. What the hell could he do with that poisoned meat? He didn't even feel like the Beast Crystal would be safe to use any longer. But, now wasn't the time to consider any of this.\nThere was suddenly a new challenge before Leonel now. Despite the fact the hive was now practically right before them, what would they do after entering it? And, what was the situation inside?\nThough their large number was an asset before, if the tunnels of the hive were narrow and cramped, this advantage would quickly become a disadvantage.\nLeonel felt a headache coming on, but he followed the charging bears in without hesitation. He could only ignore the roars coming from the remaining four legions of beasts.\nUnlike the beasts Leonel didn't charge into the first tunnel he could. After reaching the range of the hive, he leapt up, quickly climbing the hill-like structure and dropping down a tunnel with a fairly shallow fall.\nSeeing Leonel's actions, the youths followed with little hesitation. His method was indeed the best. The beasts were straight forward, so they automatically entered the easiest holes of the hive, but who said they had to do so as well?\nEntering the darkness, Leonel suddenly felt a calmness still his heart. He almost felt right at home. How long had he spent in those dark Mayan tunnels, using nothing but his sharp senses to navigate his path ahead.\nHe had an instinct to run forward as quickly as possible, but Leonel didn't do this. Instead, he turned around and held his ground, waiting for the youths who followed in after him.\nThe tunnels were wide enough for about four robust males to walk shoulder to shoulder at once. Not too narrow, but also not too large.\nWhile this was a bit of a disadvantage with their numbers being about 80, it was a disadvantage the enemy had to contend with as well. Though Leonel's approach sent them away from the majority of beasts, he would be too naive if he thought that not a single one would follow them in.\nHe could sense that the spider king hadn't approached the hive for whatever reason, but this was good news. He wouldn't know how to deal with that beast king's poison breath in such a small place. If it really came, he would have no choice but to run.\nAt that moment, the first line of youths caught up with Leonel.\n\"Run by me, I'll hold the line here and kill any beasts that follow us in.\" Leonel said quickly.\nRoaring Black Lion and the other top youths of the Southern and Eastern Lookouts were the first to catch up, unsurprisingly. When they heard Leonel's words, they understood his intention and nodded.\nKing of Seas and Pisces hesitated for a moment, but they still followed suit. If they really stirred up problems right now, they probably wouldn't just be the enemy of the Southern Lookout youths. At that point, maybe even their own people would turn against them.\nTheir gazes flickered as they retreated and Leonel pretended not to notice…\n**\n\"Bear King died?\"\nAt that moment, a familiar youth's eyes opened wide. He stood frozen on the spot, unable to understand. Compared to his reaction when wererat 006 died, this was far more dignified. He knew exactly how powerful this creature of his was, yet it had died? Could it be that other powerful beasts had appeared? That was impossible, he had scouted the entire island and taken all the SS-grade threats under his control. Unless those beasts from the ocean really got here so quickly?\n\"Young Lord, is something the matter?\"\nAt that moment, the others looked toward the youth, realizing his weird expression. They all understood that something outside of their expectations must have happened. The group that had been traveling down a particularly dark tunnel couldn't help but pause their steps.\nThe young man stood silent for a long while, not responding to the questions his subordinates had for him. He was trying to decide whether or not he should call in the other beast kings to deal with this potential threat, but in the end, he shook his head.\nSince only Bear King died, it likely meant that other the beast kings had come together to deal with the situation. If he called them in now, it might very well be allowing that creature a chance to enter where it might not otherwise be able to.\nLeonel had always assumed that the beasts were waiting outside the hive for a specific moment… Maybe the Force geyser was dangerous or maybe the mine it originated from wasn't perfectly ripe yet… Aside from this, he hadn't thought of another possibility… The possibility that the beast kings were guarding the entrance at the request of their master.\nThe youth looked up from his thoughts. \"Let's go, we need to explore these tunnels and find the path toward the Force Crystal mine faster.\"\nThe guards around the youth looked toward his multi-lense monocle and didn't dare to disobey.",

      "content": "Leonel sat at a corner of the cave, breathing heavily.\nCompared to a few hours ago, he was in a far sorrier state. At least, he looked to be.\nThough his clothes were fairly clean due to the abilities of his chain necklace, the rest of him was dead tired. His visage was pale, his fingers twitched every so often due to the exhaustion of his muscles, and his breathing was haggard.\nWithin the cave that branched from the tunnels of the hive, the other youths were present as well. Some of them sent worshiping gazes toward Leonel while others had more complicated looks.\nAmong them, King of Seas and Pisces were especially left feeling complex. They knew now how powerful Leonel was but it only left them feeling even more helpless.\nAfter a long while, Leonel's breathing finally calmed. He really wanted to go to bed at this point. His sleep in recent weeks hadn't been great due to that Dark Elemental beast. However, he obviously couldn't do so now. This was no different than the calm before the storm.\nThey had dealt with their initial safety, but if they still cared about their longterm safety, they had to find a way to deal with the geyser. Though the cave they were in now seemed calm, this wasn't the case at all.\nThe wind in here was especially volatile. It wasn't enough to hurt any of them, but the fact there was strong wind in a cave located so deep underground was already enough to raise an eyebrow. In addition, Leonel really didn't know if there were any other dangers associated with the Force geyser, so sleeping in such a place was definitely not an option, at least not until he handled some things.\nTaking a deep breath to finally calm his heart, Leonel took out the silver disk dictionary.\n\"How dangerous is this Force geyser?\"\nDue to the overall silent atmosphere, Leonel's sudden voice definitely drew a lot of attention, especially since many had been sparing him glances to begin with. At first they thought he was talking to himself, but then they suddenly remembered that weird voice that replied to him before when he asked for the spider king's weakness and couldn't help but listen intently.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ The term 'Force geyser' is unrecognized. Judging by Seed's meaning, 'Force Eruption' is being referenced. ]\n[ Force flows from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. The human body is considered to be a semi-closed system. When approaching a Force Eruption, there is the potential of inducing a Force Node Implosion which can result in the crippling or death of the person in question. ]\nHearing this response, the youths immediately paled. Even Leonel grew several levels more serious. Did this mean that their best option was to ride out this Force Eruption until it came to an end?\n\"How long do Force Eruptions last?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, it depends on the cause. ]\n\"What can cause Force Eruptions?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Force Eruptions can be caused by the evolution of Force Mines, the death of powerful beasts, the evolution of worlds, the eruption of Sub-Dimensional Zones… ]\nThe dictionary went on to list what seemed like an endless number of cases. In the end, Leonel had no choice but to cut it off.\n\"How long will this one last?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Fluctuations detected. Force Eruption 93% similar to evolution of Fourth Dimensional Force Crystal Mine. 37% similar to birth of Crystal Spirit. ]\n[ Calculating… ]\n[ 128:12:37:05 ]\nAt first, Leonel didn't understand what the numbers meant, but when it clicked for him, his jaw couldn't help but clench.\n\"128 days, 12 hours, 37 minutes and 5 seconds…\"\nWhen the other youths figured it out themselves, they paled even worse than they had before. How could they last for so long? That was practically half a year!\nWhere could they get the food and water they needed? Even if they could somehow find a way to solve this problem, would they really be safe all this time?\nThe worst part was that this was just the time it would take for the Force geyser to stop. Who knew how long the Force in this area would stay at a high concentration? As long as there was a vast difference between the Force in this region and others, it would still be a hot bed for powerful creatures.\nAs if all of this wasn't enough, even after the Force reached an equilibrium, would that guarantee that the beasts who came would leave? What if they took this as their permanent residence? And, even if they didn't, how long would it take them to leave?\nIf all of these things were taken into consideration, the time they needed to spend here could easily cross a year, maybe even two or three.\nThe more they thought, the more they despaired. Would this really be the place they died?\nLeonel's eyes narrowed. He had absolutely no intention of dying here nor did he have any intention of staying in this place for so long.\n\"Is there any way to stop a Force Eruption ahead of time?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ The Force Eruption of a Force Crystal Mine is a natural process used to increase the Force concentration of an evolving world… ]\nHearing to this point, Leonel couldn't help but despairing a bit as well. If this was a natural, necessary process. Didn't that mean they had no choice but to wait? However, the next part sparked his light of hope once again.\n[ … the process involves forming Natural Force Arts. To speed up the action of drawing these Natural Force Arts, it is necessary to infuse the Force Crystal Mine Core with high level Force Strengthening Deviations. ]\nGrasping onto this faint hope, Leonel's heart grew agitated.\n\"What are Natural Force Arts and how are they related to the Force Crystal Mine?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, Natural Force Arts are the creation of natural phenomena and often power naturally occurring evolutions. Complex runes are currently being slowly drawn on the Force Crystal Mine Core, the Force Eruption is the result of this process. ]\nAfter knowing this, Leonel only had one question left…\n\"What can I do to get close to a Force Eruption without dying?\"",

      "content": "\"That's too reckless, we can't do that!\"\n\"And what are we going to do if not? Wait here for death?\"\n\"He's right. What are we going to eat and drink? We won't last even half a week in this state.\"\nThe raging debate of the youths went back and forth. It had already been two hours since Leonel's dictionary last spoke, yet they still hadn't come to any sort of consensus.\nLeonel leaned against a wall, not saying much of anything as he watched on. He had already made his decision. He would most definitely be traveling down to find the Force Crystal Mine Core. The only reason he hadn't yet was because he was allowing his body to recover.\nHe had drawn too deeply into his reserves. Even before he battled the coy fish, that Dark Elemental beast had put him in a sorry state. His battle with the spider king and bear king only made an already bad situation worse. As if that wasn't enough, it took him another few hours to kill all the beasts that entered the same tunnel they had.\nFor now, he needed sleep and rest. After that, he would think of a plan.\nHe didn't know enough about how this hive was constructed. It was very possible that it was separated into segments that couldn't be accessed from one another no matter how much one walked through them. In that case, it might be necessary to exit this network of tunnels and enter again through another entrance.\nThinking to this point, Leonel couldn't help but sigh to himself. Why was nothing ever easy?\nUnfortunately, he had learned long ago in the Mayan tomb that his Internal Sight couldn't penetrate walls. At best, he could snake it through the paths and look ahead.\nLeonel suddenly looked up, feeling that someone had suddenly sat by his side. It didn't take him long to realize that it was Roaring Black Lion even in the dim lights.\n\"It's funny to watch them, don't you think?\"\nLeonel chuckled slightly. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\"They're separated into two groups. One group is too cowardly to go and wouldn't dare risk themselves. The other is also too cowardly even though they're pushing for us to go. They have no intention of putting themselves in the line of danger at all. They're only so adamant because they think we'll take on the brunt of the troubles for them.\n\"Which one do you think is worse?\"\nRoaring Black Lion did find this clown show to be quite funny. All of those powerful enough to actually make a difference weren't even speaking. Those like Leonel, him, Thunderous Clap and even King of Seas' group, were all in their own little corners of the cave. It was like they were allowing the weak to make the decision for them.\nThe truth was that since they were the most powerful, they suffered the most to get them here. How could they have the energy to mind this argument? Most of them already made their own decision.\n\"Which is the worst?\" Leonel thoughtfully smiled for moment. \"Probably the seven of us who aren't speaking at all.\"\nRoaring Black Lion was shocked by Leonel's response for a moment before he broke out into laughter.\n\"Interesting, interesting.\"\nThough Roaring Black Lion's laughter caught some attention, it wasn't long before the heated discussion continued.\nHe felt that Leonel wasn't wrong. All seven of them were sitting back, watching those far weaker than them debate back and forth as though their opinions meant anything. It was almost like watching the truth of the world play out before them.\nHow often did the weak argue their points, hoping to make their voices heard, only for those at the top to completely ignore them and move along as they pleased? The common people probably lamented this about their politicians all the time.\nLeonel sighed. He couldn't help but think of the deaths of all those commoners on the Paradise Islands. Was that really the only way to do things? If his father wasn't from a higher world, would he also be so unlucky?\nSometimes he couldn't help but think he wasn't very special. Maybe one could say he worked hard, but he definitely wasn't the hardest worker. There were probably those out there working ten times, even a hundred times, harder than him. Yet, they probably didn't have even half of his results.\nWhat should he tell these people? Too bad? Be born with better parents in your next life?\nSeemingly sensing the heavy thoughts his innocent question brought down upon Leonel, Roaring Black Lion patted his shoulder.\n\"I wanted to tell you thank you, I didn't get a chance to before.\"\nLeonel blinked. \"Thank you? For what?\"\n\"For covering my face after our battle. And, I guess for also clearing a path for all of us to get this far. I know you didn't have to.\"\nLeonel's brows raised. He didn't expect such a simple action of his to elicit such thankfulness from Roaring Black Lion. He hadn't even really thought about it much back then. He only thought that since they were all obviously hiding their faces for a reason, he should help them out with that.\nLeonel himself didn't really care much about the mask he wore either. He only wore it for the sake of blending in. The Empire definitely knew everything about him already. At this point, there wasn't much of a need to hide himself in this way.\n\"Though that brute over there doesn't say it, he's thankful too.\" Roaring Black Lion said with a laugh, pointing toward Thunderous Clap.\nLeonel smiled. \"There's no need to thank me, it didn't take much effort on my part at all.\"\nRoaring Black Lion looked Leonel up and down as though trying to figure something out.\n\"What, is there something on my face?\"\n\"You're too easy to talk to, sir Indomitable.\" Roaring Black Lion said in an overly servile manner.\nLeonel laughed. \"I didn't even pick that name, didn't you guys pick it for me?\"\n\"Who the hell would give you that name? Stop bullshitting.\"\nThe laughter of the two men seemed to ease the tension they were feeling. However, Leonel didn't expect that another would sit beside him at this point, and it would actually be Flowing Wind.",

      "content": "\"Hey, hey. What do you think you're doing here little vixen?\" Roaring Black Lion had an immediate reaction to Flowing Wind's appearance. It was clear that he didn't like her much.\n\"Nobody's here for you, you brute. Don't even know how to treat a lady.\"\nRoaring Black Lion was stunned speechless for a moment. Wasn't this the same woman who told him he wanted to see him break her in half? She practically had an innuendo fitted into her words every other sentence. Why was she pretending to be prim and proper now? Wasn't this too shameless?\nBut, when he saw how she wanted to get close to Leonel, he couldn't help but roll his eyes. This little vixen really was too shameless.\nLeonel sensed the soft mounds pressing against his arm. He had been forced to throw away his shirt, so his torso was still completely bare at the moment, making the sensation especially tantalizing.\nLeonel shifted away slightly, causing Flowing Wind to pout. Unfortunately, she couldn't see Leonel's reaction with his mask. But, she subconsciously thought that he was embarrassed.\nFlowing Wind's gaze swept over Leonel's toned torso, her eyes lighting with an appreciative gaze. It seemed she liked what she saw, maybe a little too much.\n\"They call you Indomitable?\"\n\"Unfortunately.\" Leonel mumbled.\nFlowing Wind was confused by this response, but it only made her more interested in Leonel.\n\"You're quite powerful. Usually they don't let those as powerful as you out. How'd you manage to come here?\" Flowing Wind asked curiously.\n\"I was kidnapped.\" Leonel mumbled just as unenthusiastically. He wasn't sure what Flowing WInd meant by those words, but he was too lazy to ask.? \"Anyway, I'm going to sleep. I haven't had a good night's rest in too long. Let me know what happens while I'm gone.\"\nBefore the two could wonder what Leonel meant, he got up and moved to an empty corner of the cave, allowing the Segmented Cube to take him in.\nThe youths watched on as the Segmented Cube unfolded, taking up about a ten meter region. This was at least 10% of the cave, but no one dared to feel dissatisfied. Without Leonel they wouldn't have even made it so far.\nRoaring Black Lion and Flowing Wind's gazes met without Leonel between them, sparks flying.\n\"Aren't you going to scram now?\"\nFlowing Wind giggled as though she hadn't heard the words.\n\"Is that friend of yours gay?\"\nRoaring Black Lion was stunned speechless. What the hell was wrong with this woman? Even the most… robust of men wouldn't care for a woman when they were that tired. There were many a fallen soldier on the battlefield that was the bed room due to this exact reason. What a poisonous woman, poking fun at such a thing.\n\"Do you think you're that special?\" Roaring Black Lion retorted.\n\"… Yes.\" Flowing Wind said shamelessly.\nLeonel collapsed into bed, falling into a dream land. He felt quite thankful that that little beast that had been harassing him all this time hadn't appeared since he entered the center region of the island…\n**\nWhile Leonel was sleeping, the Commanders who were off shore of the island were battling for their lives.\nViolet Rain looked off into the distance toward the Force geyser billowing into the skies. Her expression couldn't help but flicker between helplessness and a complicated feeling.\nSuddenly, another massive tentacle surged up from the turbulent sea.\n\"Damned beast, die!\"\nHer hair fluttered, turning a slight shade of dark violet. Her eyes gained the same tint as she raised her arms into the air.\nViolet clouds appeared above her head before a torrential rain of violet droplets fell.\nSSSKKKKRRRREEEEEEEE!!!!\nWith every droplet that fell, another piece of flesh was melted away. In what seemed like the blink of an eye, a tentacle of over ten meters in length became nothing more than bubbling, putrid liquid on the surface of the ocean.\nViolet Rain's ability was likely one of the only reasons Southern Lookout's ship had managed to last so long. The longer she kept it activated, the more toxic the surrounding waters became, and the less likely creatures were to approach them. As a result, most of the beasts took the long way around their ship, avoiding them entirely. After all, the source of the Force they wanted so much wasn't coming from the Commanders.\nHowever, despite this, Violet Rain's expression only grew uglier and uglier.\nShe couldn't help but worry about the youths on the island. But, she also knew that charging ahead to go to save them would only lead to her and the crew's death. Her strength wasn't far above that of the youths. In fact, she wouldn't necessarily win in a battle against any of them.\nThough her ability was powerful, it was also extremely taxing to use as well. It was simply impossible for her to use it endlessly.\n\"Mellow Trees! What's the situation, have you managed to call for reinforcements yet?!\" Violet Rain called out.\n\"We're trying our best, but the Force Eruption is making communication difficult. We might have to leave the range of the island entirely first.\"\n\"No!\" Violet Rain vehemently disapproved.\nWhat if the youths came to the shore looking for them? At least with her here, there was a small safe haven around the poisoned waters she created. At least the youths would stand a chance if they waited.\nBut, if they left, what would happen to the youths? How could Violet Rain know that all of the youths she was worried about had already entered the eye of the storm?\n\"Violet Rain, we need to way the pros and cons here…\" Mellow Trees tried to persuade.\n\"Stop, stop, stop.\" Violet Rain waved a hand. \"I don't believe for a second that we are the only ones aware about this Force Eruption. Not only are we aware, the Eastern Lookout Commanders definitely are as well. And, it won't be long before the Lookouts themselves are aware as well. We have to stay here and wait for reinforcements. Keep trying to see if you can get a message through.\"\nThe other Commanders looked at one another and sighed. Violet Rain didn't have a higher status than any of them, but she was the closest to her next promotion because her ability was rated within the S-grade. For now, they could only listen to her words.\n'Damned brat, you better not really be a spy. As long as you aren't, help those kids get out of there…'\nWho knows how Leonel would react if he knew Violet Rain was thinking about him like this?",

      "content": "Leonel woke up, a long yawn pulling at his lips. Though he didn't sleep for as long as he wanted to, it was enough for him to regain some of his energy at the very least.\nHe stared at the ceiling blankly, wondering what his next course of action should be.\nAfter a while of coming up with nothing, he dragged his body to the pool in the Abode Setting, stripping his clothes and jumping in. Before he realized what was happening, he had already fallen asleep again.\nWhen he woke up once more, he smiled bitterly to himself. It seemed that his thoughts of getting ahead of these matters could be thrown out the window now. He wasn't sure how long he had been asleep, but it was most definitely at least a day, maybe two.\nWith a sigh, he stood and stretched. One would expect his skin to be a bit prune-like after staying in water for so long. But, it seemed that this water was quite special.\n'What to do… What to do…'\nLeonel knew he needed to find the source of the Force geyser, but this was easier than it sounded.\nThough the Force geyser blew a hole through the hive, if Leonel approached it from the outside, he would only be asking for death.\nAccording to the dictionary, the only way to protect one's self against a Force Eruption was to form what the dictionary called 'Force Skin'. This was apparently a Force manipulation type technique.\nForce Skin added a layer of protection to one's body using Force. As long as one created one of high enough concentration, the Force around the Force Eruption wouldn't detect the low Force concentration within your body and would thus not try to enter your Force Nodes.\nThere were a few problems with this though, the main of which was stamina. It took a lot to create such a high density Force Skin. That meant that it was in their best interest to delay the time they spent in direct contact with the Force geyser as much as possible.\nObviously, if they wanted to do this, they couldn't enter from the top of the hive, or else their Force Skins would give out before they could even get close. Their best option was to take advantage of these network of tunnels to block the brunt of the Force Eruption and only expose themselves when they were already as close as possible.\nUnfortunately, this was easier said than done.\nLeonel absentmindedly switched the Segmented Cube into its Lab Setting. It was only now he realized that the Force concentration of the Segmented Cube had actually recovered so quickly. In fact, not only had it recovered, it was the highest concentration Leonel had ever seen it at.\n'This should probably be enough for me to form my Seventh and Eighth Nodes…'\nThough he thought this, Leonel hesitated to do it. Without knowing where his Ninth should go, he felt a bit doubtful of himself. What if he really was taking the wrong path?\n'Maybe I should ask the dictionary…'\nLeonel threw this to the back of his mind. Now wasn't the time to think about this. Whether he had nine Nodes or six, he would still need to get as close to the Force geyser as possible if he didn't want to die. What was more important now was figuring out how to deal with this situation.\nLeonel's gaze swept across the shelves of snowglobes. By now, they were filled with all sorts of creatures, each perfectly preserved. He had already killed well over 200 beasts since he stepped onto this island, so there were definitely quite a number.\nSuddenly Leonel's eyes widened when his gaze landed on the snowglobe housing the SS-grade coy fish's Beast Crystal.\nNow that he knew that even the spider king was only of the S-grade, albeit of the Elite S-grade, Leonel had a feeling the coy fish was probably just of the Elite S-grade as well. He didn't believe there was a big difference between the two, it was just that the spider king's ability was too troublesome to deal with.\nHowever, this wasn't the reason Leonel reacted like this. The moment his eyes landed on the Beast Crystal, an idea popped into his head.\nHadn't he ignored King of Seas and Pisces' displeasure precisely so that he could use this Beast Crystal to create an escape type treasure? What if instead of using it to escape, he used it to carve a straight line toward the Force geyser instead?!\nLeonel's eyes glowed like two bright torches when he thought to this point. He got so excited that he stirred his aching body a bit too much, causing a jolt of pain to knock him back into reality.\n'Having the idea is one thing, but executing on it is a completely different matter. I also don't know if I have the necessary materials to make such a treasure…'\nLeonel's brow furrowed, but then he suddenly thought of something.\nIf the dictionary could scan and find Zones, could it scan and find other things? If that was the case, maybe it wasn't even necessary for him to refine this treasure now.\n\"Are you able to find your way through these tunnels?\" Leonel asked expectantly.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, Father Overlord has not programmed this function into the dictionary. When Seed is skilled enough, it will be possible to upgrade and modify the dictionary himself. ]\nLeonel almost couldn't refrain from rolling his eyes. He should have expected that his father would program in a name like that for himself.\n\"… What kinds of things can you scan for, then?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, the dictionary can scan for anything within its database. ]\nLeonel shook his head at this response. Clearly this was making things more complicated that it needed to be. Essentially, this dictionary had the technology necessary to scan these mines, but not the programming necessary to turn this into useful information for him. It was either that this was an oversight, or his old man was purposely making things difficult for him.\nTaking a deep breath, Leonel threw these things to the back of his mind.\n\"Scan for ore veins within this network of tunnels for me.\"\nLeonel didn't believe that a hive that hosted a Force Crystal Mine Core didn't have other ores lying in wait for his use. This was the ideal environment for the formation of such treasures.\nSince he didn't have the materials he needed, he would just have to mine them on his own.",

      "content": "When Leonel reappeared within the cave, several eyes looked toward him at once. Their reactions were so quick that Leonel could practically here the wind their spinning heads caused.\nToward such a reaction, he could only smile bitterly. It seemed that they really had been waiting for him. Not a single person was missing from the time he had left to now. What else could they be doing if not waiting for him?\n\"Have you all come to a decision?\" Leonel asked.\nThe youths looked at one another, but it seemed that the answer to the question was no. They had likely just gotten tired of arguing and let the matter rest for now. At least… that was what Leonel had thought before he realized that many of them were even avoiding his gaze as though being embarrassed by something.\n\"What about you all?\" Leonel asked with narrowed eyes.\nThough it was the same question, this time, Leonel very obviously aimed it toward the six others who could be considered near his level of strength.\nPisces stood upon hearing these words, walking toward Leonel with a confident expression. Though there didn't seem to be disdain in her gaze, this was only because she knew that Leonel was much more powerful than she was. However, there seemed to be something that had greatly boosted her boldness regardless.\n\"While you were away, we came to a consensus as a group.\"\n\"Oh? Did you?\"\nLeonel looked past Pisces, sending a questioning gaze toward the others.\nHe only got a shrug from Roaring Black Lion. Thunderous Clap avoided his gaze as though he too was embarrassed. As for Chasing Wind, though she met his gaze, there was a tinge of guilt within her eyes. But, for some reason, she would feel even more guilty not meeting Leonel's gaze, so she put in effort to not look away. As for Flowing Wind, she was observing the situation as though she was a passerby, happy to see the world burn.\nThough Leonel couldn't see their faces, making it difficult to tell their true intentions, he still had a good idea.\nRoaring Black Lion didn't seem to care about what was going on. He only shrugged to show that he had nothing to do with what was happening, but he couldn't do much to change anything either.\nThunderous Clap likely put the most effort into trying to stop what was happening, but he too couldn't move the needle. He seemed to take this much harder than Roaring Black Lion, something that made Leonel smile beside himself. He found this Thunderous Clap to be quite adorable.\nAs for Chasing Wind, her gaze seemed to make it seem like she had made the most logical decision for herself. As such, though she felt 'bad' for Leonel, it wasn't to the extent of changing her decision. Her actions of meeting his gaze was to let him know this.\n'Interesting, interesting…'\nThe last person Leonel looked at was King of Seas, he seemed to have the most sour look in his eyes as though he was losing out even more than Leonel. After seeing this, Leonel had a decent idea of what 'decision' these people had come to.\n\"I don't agree!\"\nBefore Pisces could even explain what was going on, Seer suddenly called out.\n\"I don't agree either.\"\nPrecious Moment affirmed Seer's words.\nThe two of them had been saved by Leonel at a critical moment. Had it not been for Leonel, they would be dead. How could they agree to this?\nIn truth, it wasn't just them that had been saved. Even setting aside the fact that Leonel taking the vanguard had kept their casualties to a minimum, there were many others he had directly saved just like the two of them.\n\"Your opinions were already heard. We came to a consensus as a group. Further words are meaningless. I'm sure you already remember the vote totals.\" Pisces spoke coldly, not allowing the two to say any more.\nShe swept a glance of indifference toward them before looking back toward Leonel with her lofty expression as though everything was playing to her tune.\n\"In your absence, we decided that our best chance at survival was for you to hand over the SS-grade Beast Crystal to me. As long as I ingest it, there is a high chance my ability will mutate to gain some characteristics of the coy fish. In that case, maneuvering through these tunnels will become much safer for us all and we'll be able to follow the advice your treasure gave us.\"\nThat day, they had all heard the words of the dictionary. So, they knew well the importance of approaching as closely to the Force geyser as possible before facing its direct might. If Pisces could awaken this ability, it really would be their best chance.\nLeonel didn't have much of a reaction to this. Instead, he looked toward King of Seas.\n\"And why did everyone choose you and not him?\"\nA tinge of red flashed by King of Seas' gaze. It seemed that he now hated Pisces just as much as he hated Leonel. But, there was nothing he could do about it anymore.\nPisces sneered, thinking that Leonel wanted to sow discord. But, she replied calmly as though everything was still easily within her grasp. In her opinion, the big obstacle had been King of Seas, not Leonel. It wasn't because the former was more powerful than the latter, but because only the former could sway public opinion away from her.\n\"It's simple, really. King of Seas' affinity with water can only be considered auxiliary. His main ability is his transformation into a merman. This allows him greater defense, strength and speed, in addition to a boost to these things while in the presence of water. Of course, he also gains the ability to breathe under water as well.\"\nPisces explained patiently and without hurry.\n\"However, water manipulation is my main ability. Compared to him, the likelihood of my ability mutating is far higher. So, if we were to take a chance on anyone, it should most definitely be me.\"\nNumerous people nodded to this, even Chasing Wind. It seemed that she had also been swayed by this logic. It did indeed make sense. And, in Chasing Wind's opinion, it would be quite selfish of Leonel to refuse. After all, he didn't have a water ability.\n\"I hope you don't take offense to this.\" Chasing Wind suddenly spoke. In fact, if Leonel thought about it, this was the first time he had ever heard her voice. \"We are only trying out best with what we have. Had you had a water ability, none of us would have agreed to this.\"\nLeonel nodded toward this. He indeed didn't feel angry about this. That said…\n\"I understand where you all are coming from and there isn't anything wrong with your line of thinking.\"\nPisces' smile bloomed when she heard this, almost as though the Beast Crystal was already in her hands.\n\"Unfortunately, I still can't agree.\"\nToward this, Pisces' expression could only darken.",

      "content": "\"You…\" Pisces swallowed her anger and regained her calm. \"… Are you sure that's the decision you want to make? I know that you are very powerful, but this is a matter of life and death for us all, do you understand this?\"\nLeonel could already sense several hostile gazes aimed toward him. The only ones who didn't seem to have this reaction were Seer and Precious Moment, along with Roaring Black Lion, Thunderous Clap, and, surprisingly, King of Seas. It seemed the last took quite a bit of pleasure in Leonel rejecting Pisces.\nOf course, there was also Flowing Wind who seemed excited by this turn of events. Only now would she be able to watch the best show.\nCalming Wind furrowed her brows, looking toward Leonel with disappointment.\nLeonel shook his head. These people really wanted to fight him?\nHe had to admit, he really couldn't beat them all. This space was too restricted, for one. And, secondly, his body still hadn't recovered from making sure they all got here safely, ironically. Of course, if he wanted to run, he didn't think that any of them had the speed to keep up with him, but, without the map of the tunnels, there was no telling whether or not he would run into a dead end before he escaped.\nOf course, he had already memorized the path they took to get here, but that led outside. What was he going to do, run back to those beast legions? Who knew what kind of wild nonsense was happening out there right now?\nUltimately, he really didn't have the ability to deal with all of them.\nThough he was disappointed in what was happening, he could understand where they all were coming from. Those from the Southern Lookout still had a somewhat jaded opinion of him. It was only due to his recent actions that those ill feelings began to turn around somewhat.\nHowever, humans were creatures who often fell victim to group think and confirmation bias. Whatever good impression they had of Leonel was easily overridden by his actions now. To an outside observer, his actions did indeed seem selfish.\nFrom one perspective, Leonel didn't have to give his things to others if he didn't feel like it. But, this time, this matter involved all of their lives. How could they just sit idly by?\n\"Indomitable, don't be so shameless. This isn't about you.\" Ruptured Artery, who already hated Leonel to the core to begin with, couldn't help but to stand out at this moment.\nThe rowdiness of the group of youths seemed to only grow with each passing moment. Pisces didn't even have to say a word and many had already defended her position for her.\n\"That's enough, this doesn't need to devolve to violence.\" Calming Wind finally stood from her seated position, walking toward Leonel.\n\"Indomitable, please think of the overall situation. Is it really appropriate for you to act in this way?\"\nLeonel was starting to feel a bit annoyed. After all, he was human. As much as he wanted to be 'understanding', he had limited patience as well. But, still, since he knew their intentions weren't overly sinister, he kept whatever bubbling dissatisfaction he had down.\nInstead of exploding with anger, he flipped a palm, allowing a familiar silver disk to appear.\n\"Scan her ability.\" Leonel said calmly.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Generating nomenclature… ]\n[ Evolution Stage: Tier 6 Black ]\n[ Evolution Type: Elemental ]\n[ Evolution: Water Sense, Water Manipulation ]\n[ Water Sense: Greater affinity for Water Elemental Force. 50% boost in comprehension and power in using water based Force Techniques.? ]\n[ Water Manipulation: Control over the Water Element. ]\nPisces widened her eyes. Even the Slayer Legion Lookout hadn't been capable of giving such sharp analysis of her ability. What was going on? And, more importantly, what was Leonel's purpose?\n\"What is the likelihood she would gain the water metamorphosis ability upon absorbing the coy fish's Beast Crystal?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, Father Overlord did not program this function into the dictionary. Once you are skilled enough, it will be possible to upgrade the dictionary. ]\nPisces, whose heart had constricted, sighed a breath of relief. Her smile bloomed once more as she felt Leonel's display had failed. What would he do now that his little trick was going nowhere?\nLeonel, seemingly having expected this, though, didn't show much of a reaction.\n\"What are the chances of mutating an ability upon the ingestion of a Beast Crystal?\"\nIt seemed that the dictionary wasn't able to perform ultra specific tasks. Leonel had a feeling that his father purposely created it this way. Like this, he would be able to gain supplementary knowledge without relying on the dictionary to do every and anything for him.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, without a Crystal Absorption Technique, the likelihood is 1 in 10 000. With a Crystal Absorption Technique, the odds are closer to 1 in 10. ]\nPisces' expression, which had just regained some color, paled once again. She definitely didn't have such a technique, or else she definitely wouldn't have reacted this way. But, after a moment, she recovered again.\n\"I get it, you've proved your point.\" Pisces said calmly. \"But, compared to you who has a 0% chance, my odds are still better.\"\nThose who had begun to falter after hearing the odds steeled their hearts. Pisces was right. A 1% in a 1% chance was still better than a 0% chance.\nLeonel pretended as though he hadn't heard Pisces.\n\"What are the chances a Force Crafter has in extracting a specific ability from a Beast Crystal?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ A Force Crafter with a Crystal Spirit Familiar has a 100% chance. All other Force Crafters have a percentage chance depending on their skill and their strength in comparison to the beast the crystal was taken from. ]\n\"What are the lowest odds?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, about 10-20% as long as the Beast Crystal shares its Dimensional Grade with the Force Crafter. If trying to extract an ability from a higher Dimensional creature, 0%. ]\n\"Am I a Force Crafter?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Yes. ]\n\"What are my odds of success?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Taking Seed's ability into consideration, Seed has a 78% chance of success. ]\n\"And if I awaken my Metal Synergy Lineage Factor?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ That would allow Seed to take greater advantage of the senses of Seed's Metal Spirit which would boost the chance of sensing the ability in question. In this case, it will be about 92% ]\nThe more Leonel spoke, the paler Pisces became. It was as though she could see the Beast Crystal she thought of in her dreams slipping away.",

      "content": "Leonel was pleasantly surprised that the dictionary was able to give him the odds he needed. He was prepared for it to be unable to do so, just like it wasn't able to read Pisces' specific odds. But, if he thought about it, it made a bit of sense.\nThe dictionary his father left him had two major purposes. The first was to inform him about things he was ignorant of and the second was to guide his Force Crafting. It made sense that it was unable to use its scanning ability for tasks unrelated to Force Crafting, but could when the topic at hand was crafting itself.\n'Since it's like this, it's a bit more acceptable.' Leonel nodded to himself.\n\"I think a 78% chance is better than a 0.001% chance, right?\" Leonel asked.\nPisces gritted her teeth, but she really had no response.\nForce Crafting? This was already an incredibly rare profession to begin with. For those of Earth who had just taken their first step toward evolution, the rarity was even more exaggerated. The Force Crafters of Earth could be slotted into two categories. Either they were curious scientists who held positions as researchers even before the Metamorphosis descended, or they were among the very few who awakened Force Crafting related abilities.\nThis was all to say that this profession wasn't prevalent in their minds. They could have never imagined that someone with combat effectiveness as high as Leonel would also be a Force Crafter. In fact, there were many of them who still didn't know what a Force Crafter even was.\n\"I hope you all see now that I wasn't trying to be selfish. I really am our best chance. If there's anyone else with a higher probability, I really wouldn't mind handing the Beast Crystal over.\"\nLeonel wasn't saying this just to say it. He really did see the point of view of the youths around him. Their ask of him might have seemed unfair from one perspective, but it was also not overboard either.\nIn addition, even if he had to give the coy fish's Beast Crystal over, he could still bet on himself by trying to complete a similar treasure using the bear king's Beast Crystal. The only reason he had set it aside for now was because the bear king's body was contaminated.\nAt this point, Calming Wind felt a bit embarrassed. She had gone from, albeit somewhat reluctantly, meeting Leonel's gaze, to now wanting to find a place to hide herself as quickly as possible.\nBowing her head slightly, she apologized sincerely.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nShe didn't say anything else as she retreated, causing Leonel to have a better impression of her. It seemed that the youths from the Southern Lookout really weren't bad.\n\"It's not a big deal, I didn't take any of it personally.\" Leonel replied, causing many to sigh a breath of relief.\nThe gritting of Pisces' teeth was practically audible. She had been so close, all for it to come crumbling down.\n\"How can we take your treasure's words seriously? How do we know you didn't make it say that?\"\nThe moment she spoke these words, she instantly regretted it. Her hatred had clouded her vision, causing her to say something stupid. At that point, it wasn't just Leonel who looked toward her with a weird gaze.\nIf she didn't trust the dictionary so much, why did she use its words as an excuse before when she thought getting the Beast Crystal was possible? It seemed more than a little selfish to say something like this now.\n\"Forget it, do whatever you want.\" Pisces was unwilling to hear the response she was sure she'd receive, so she cut her losses quickly, retreating to her previous sitting position.\nLeonel sighed when he saw the animosity in her eyes. Everything had been so much easier before the Metamorphosis.\n\"I still need some time to finish the craft. A few days to find the materials I need and another few days to blueprint everything. In at most a week, it should be completed.\"\nThe youths nodded toward Leonel's words, but they were still feeling a bit anxious. It had only been two days since they entered this cave, but there were already many problems to face.\nMany of them wanted to wash themselves, but had no place to do so. Compounding with that, there was no place for them to… release themselves, so many had to travel out of the cave to find uninhabited corners to release their bowels. It was the kind of situation that most definitely couldn't last for very long.\nLuckily, many of them had come with abode type treasures. After all, they knew comfort would be a luxury on the Hunt. It was thanks to this that things were somewhat better.\nBut, the reserves of water and food would be quickly eaten into.\nSeeing this, Leonel knew he had to settle their hearts. So, without hesitation, he took out three large beast corpses.\n\"Those of you with fire abilities, help the others separate out and cook this meat. Don't worry, I have enough meat to last us a few months. As for water…\"\nLeonel turned a gaze toward Pisces. \"I hope that Pisces will help us out with this. With the density of Force in the air and the help of your ability, I'm sure that condensing large amounts of water from the air shouldn't be a problem, right?\"\nPisces' eyes flashed with a clever glint, but in the next moment, she poured a bucket of cold water over her own schemes. The same way she could use public opinion to sway Leonel, Leonel could do the same to her as well. In fact, it was even more effective on her since Leonel was so much stronger than she was.\nIf she really tried to withhold water from these youths, her ending wouldn't be very good. In the end, she could only nod.\nLeonel smiled brightly, taking off his mask. The youths were stunned by this, not thinking he would do such a thing.\n\"So handsome.\" Flowing Wind's eyes lit up as though she wanted to eat Leonel up from where he stood.\n\"You can all call me Leonel. We're all in this together.\" Leonel said lightly. \"I'm not here to lead you all, nor will I make you do anything you don't want to do. As long as we stick together, getting out won't be a problem. I promise.\"\n\"Tch, you pretty playboy.\" Roaring Black Lion said. \"Don't you know saying such flowery words only makes them want to follow you more?\"\nHis sudden comment made many look at one another and burst into laughter. It felt like a weight that had been on everyone's shoulders suddenly dissipated.",

      "content": "After settling everything, Leonel stepped out from the cave, numerous eyes on his back as he vanished into the darkness.\nWatching his receding figure, King of Seas couldn't help but laugh. It seemed he got a kick out of seeing Pisces eating shit. All the anger he had had in the past day vanished into thin air, leaving him feeling comfortable.\nIt could only be said that humans were indeed weird creatures. King of Seas had gone from hating Leonel's guts to supporting him in the span of a day.\nAs for Pisces, she could only hatefully glare in Leonel's direction, but there was nothing she could do. Just like the logic had once been on her side, it was now on his. As if that wasn't bad enough… she didn't expect Leonel to have so much charisma…\n**\nLeonel leisurely strolled through the dark tunnels. Though he was still feeling the pain of his injuries and there was a severe lack of light in his surroundings, he was quite comfortable now.\n'This might be a better opportunity than I originally gave it credit for.' Leonel smiled so widely his eyes squinted.\nThe reason Leonel was so happy was because when he asked the dictionary to scan the surroundings for ore veins, the results had been far beyond his expectations. The hive was practically a treasure trove!\nThough the Force Eruption was only now occurring, it could be said that this Force Crystal Mine had been maturing for a long time already. As a result, this was the best environment Earth had for the creation of Fourth Dimensional minerals.\nNot only was the presence of Pseudo Fourth Dimensional minerals incredibly high, but there were even some veins that had already manifested true Fourth Dimensional minerals.\nIt could be said that Earth's progress in metallurgy was far beyond that of many worlds of their stature. However, the fundamental truth was that these alloys were still fragile in the face of Force.\nThis was why Leonel had to fuse Urbe Ore into the alloys he took from the sniper rifle. If he didn't do this, his pistol crafts would have been even more fragile than they were now.\nHowever, if Leonel were to use Pseudo and true Fourth Dimensional metals in his crafts, he would be able to create higher grade crafts with less effort.\nIn addition, even though Fourth Dimensional metals he was still too weak to refine could be saved for the future. In all likelihood, these metals would be very valuable even in true Fourth Dimensional worlds!\nBut now, Leonel practically had them all to himself. Thanks to the dictionary, he could easily find them through the thick walls. And, with the help of Little Tolly, the mining process wouldn't be much of an issue either.\nSeemingly sensing Leonel's excitement, the little Metal Spirit coiling around his fingers bubbled with happiness, eager to be of help.\nLeonel smiled lightly, watching the little guy play around his hands.\n'Alright, the first target is the closest, a vein of Whispering Breeze Ore…'\nLeonel quickly made his way forward. He ran into several dead ends at first since the dictionary could only point him in the general direction, but he eventually inched closer, memorizing the pathways as he went along.\nSoon, Leonel had made it to a seemingly ordinary wall of earth. Other than being slightly damp and cold to the touch, there was nothing different about it. But, Leonel trusted the dictionary.\n\"Alright little guy, let's start.\"\nLittle Tolly split into numerous little silver balls, bouncing around Leonel's hands with excitement before it coated the latter's palms.\nLeonel pressed his hands into the wall, entering Spirit Unity and using Toliver's keen senses toward valuable minerals to 'see' the hidden veins.\n'There it is…'\nAfter sensing it, Leonel began to channel Force into his Metal Spirit. Not much unlike projecting the shape of the part he wanted, Leonel made sure to only carefully carve away the pieces of earth not related to the valuable ore.\nIn truth, Little Tolly did most of the work. Even without Leonel's support, it was made to melt away and absorb minerals. In fact, it might very well be possible for Leonel to rely on his Familiar to carve a path toward the Force Eruption rather than forging a craft with the coy fish's Beast Crystal. The only reason he hadn't was because he didn't want to overwork the little guy.\nCarving out a bit of rock covering a vein was one thing, but digging through hundreds of meters of earth was a complete other thing.\nSoon, a silvery green metal shone before Leonel. It had quite a resplendent light as though it was crowned by a halo.\nHigher Dimensional metals always had halos like this. The only exception was Black Urbe Ore. As long as it was within a world beneath its Dimensional grade, it would always shine like this as though scared others were unaware of its value.\nThe more Dimensional grades a metal surpassed its current world by, the grander the halos that covered it would be. Similar logic followed for other natural treasures and even beasts and humans.\n'Whispering Breeze Ore… Its an excellent Wind Elemental Vessel and known for its sharpness and light weight. Not bad. It might be useful when I finally get around to making the movement treasure…'\nLeonel would often think of Captain Sela's chariot. Though she was a vile human being, her chariot wasn't at fault.\n'Elemental Vessels' were a type of ore. Just like Urbe Ore which was a great foundational metal, known for its ability to stabilize two opposing minerals that would otherwise not mesh, there were other families of metals as well. Elemental Vessels was a family that had an advantage toward containing certain Elemental Force types.\nAs a Wind Elemental Vessel, Whispering Breeze Ore was exceptionally good at containing the Wind Element. It also got its name due to its high level of stability. Its able to take in a large amount of Wind Element and make use of it while maintaining quiet and steady operation. This was quite ideal for forging a vehicle.\nLeonel smiled brightly. For the little guy, chewing through the normal rock around the vein wasn't a problem. It didn't even take half an hour before it was completely exposed. After that, Leonel could practically pull out the whole thing with his bare hands.\n'One down, hopefully many more to go… I'll definitely need to find a good Water Elemental Vessel… If I can find a Dual Water-Earth Elemental Vessel, I might be able to make the craft even better by integrating the coy fish's and the bear king's Beast Crystals…'\nIt seemed the saying really was true. There were only benefits to gain in the midst of danger.\nAt any other time, such a large treasury of minerals would have been monopolized by The Empire or the Slayer Legion. But now… As much as Leonel could take, he would take.",

      "content": "Many hours later, one could find Leonel in a familiar position. His hands were pressed flush against a wall as Force slowly flowed out from his hands.\nThough this seemed simple for him, it was actually quite difficult. Since he forewent placing Force Nodes in his hands, it was a bit more difficult for him in comparison to another to achieve this result. But, with how high his spirit was, how could his Force control not also be great?\nSoon, another ore had manifested. This time, it radiated a dirty gold light. It was quite similar to the fur coat of the bear king, albeit much less resplendent.\n'Black Tempered Vein Ore…' Leonel smiled happily.\nVein Ores were another family of metals. They could be considered another ore type that was almost as important as Urbe Ores. However, they were just barely lacking.\nIn truth, the value of Vein Ores was above Urbe Ores. However, the reason Urbe Ores could be considered a step above in usefulness was because it had an impossibly wide variety of applications. One could use Urbe Ores in practically every Force Craft imaginable. It was for this reason that the universal currency of the universe were Urbe Coins.\nHowever, Vein Ores were used in particularly intricate creations. They had characteristics very similar to Force pathways that linked one's Force Nodes. When they were used in crafts, they allowed Force to flow more freely.\nThat said, this wasn't the most important use of Vein Ores. Their greatest use was in drawing more permanent Force Arts.\nTake for example Leonel's pistol craft. He had to draw the Force Arts directly onto the alloys he fused with his Black Urbe Ore. However, had he liquefied a compatible Vein Ore first, and then used it to inscribe the Force Arts, their power would gain a great boost. In addition, it would greatly strengthen the nozzles as well, allowing them to withstand many more shots.\nThere was a final more secretive use of Vein Ores as well. In fact, Leonel wouldn't even be aware of this had it not been for the words of the creator of [Dimensional Cleanse].\nAccording to the creator, there was a special type of Vein Ore that could be absorbed. The special energies of this Vein Ore could be used to strengthen one's Force Nodes.\nThough this wouldn't increase the amount of Force one could hold, there were many other benefits to this.\nFirstly, it would be possible to replenish one's Force Nodes faster. It was necessary for many to artificially cap their consumption of Force to avoid damaging one's Force Nodes. Though Force Nodes are self-created, they can't be willfully abandoned. This is a law enforced by the Universe itself. So, injuries to Force Nodes needed to be avoided at all costs.\nSecondly, this would make it easier to compress Force Nodes in the future when it becomes necessary to cross the boundary of a higher Dimensional body.\nFor someone like Leonel, this second point was especially important. Though his Force Nodes being constructed of a hundred cells sounded grandiose, the truth was that this made his future path far more difficult as well. The more Force he had, the harder it was to compress, and the more pressure there would be on his body.\nThe third reason was enough for any Force cultivator to go wild with greed. Everyone was limited in the number and length of Force pathways they could create. Especially in the beginning phases of creating a Fourth Dimensional body, many could only connect their Force Nodes via a single path. But, this greatly limited their Force wielding abilities.\nWith the help of a special Vein Ore, it was possible to create many more Force Pathways, allowing one to unlock many Force wielding abilities usually reserved for higher Dimensional warriors.\nThis aside, there was a fourth reason that would greatly benefit Leonel even now.\nIf his Force Nodes were sturdier… wouldn't it also be much easier to withstand the Force Eruption?\nUnfortunately, Black Tempered Vein Ore wasn't the Vein Ore he needed to undergo this process. In addition, according to the author of [Dimensional Cleanse], it was best to wait until forming all nine Nodes before undergoing this tempering process. So, no matter how eager Leonel was for this benefit, he could only throw it to the back of his mind.\n'Alright, I think I've cleared out all the ore veins in this section of tunnels… as expected, not all the tunnels are linked. If I want to explore more tunnels, I'll have to leave the hive and enter through another entrance…'\nLeonel was hesitant to do this. He didn't know what the situation was outside. If he left, he would probably expose everyone to danger again. Even if he set everyone else apart, he still needed to worry about himself. After all, he would still need a while longer to recover to his peak.\n'Forget it, forget it. I've harvested enough for now and have all the materials I need. Even though I didn't find a Dual Water-Earth Elemental Vessel ore, I did find an Earth one. If I combined that with the Rushing River Vein Ore I found, it would still be possible to combine the two Beast Crystal abilities…'\nMuch like Elemental Vessels, there were different types of Vein Ores as well. Rushing River Vein Ores were especially good at inscribing for Water Elemental Force Arts. So, if Leonel was careful with his planning, it would be possible to combine the two without much issue.\nJust like before, Leonel took his time to dig the entire vein out. He knew that if he kept the core of the vein intact, it might be possible for the vein to grow more ores for him in the future. Who knows, maybe the Segmented Cube had this ability as well. Even if it didn't, Leonel would still do this.\nJust when Leonel was content with his gains and about to return to the cave to get started on the blueprints, his steps suddenly froze.\nThere, on the wall he just extracted the vein from, there were faint cracks.\nIt was incredibly difficult to spot, but there seemed to be a faint light coming from the other side. If it wasn't for the fact most of the hive was so dark, it wouldn't have been so hard for Leonel to spot the cracks because even if his side was dark, the other side would be flooded with light.\n'This part of the wall is so thin…? I can probably pass my Internal Sight through then to see if it's worth getting Little Tolly's help to knock it away. It might not necessarily be a good thing to have a path to another network of tunnels…'\nAfter having this thought, Leonel snaked his Internal Sight forward, passing through the gaps to see what was on the other side. But, the result left him stunned speechless.\nNot only was the other side almost like an entire separate world, what shocked him the most was that there were actually other people there. Not just the fact they were other people, but the fact they were other people with characteristics Leonel was all too familiar with.\n'Red hair… red eyes… The Brazinger Clan?'",

      "content": "Leonel was shocked. The very last group of people he could have ever expected to find here was the Brazinger Clan. Wasn't this the personal island of the Slayer Legion? Didn't they monitor it? Were they really so incompetent to allow others to sneak in here so easily?\nLeonel had already had a hard time taking the Slayer Legion seriously, but it felt as though their every action really only made him look down on them more.\nAfter a while, he calmed himself. He realized that he had only reacted like this because of how hard the past few days had been. It seemed that even he needed someone to vent his frustration on.\n'Stay calm…' Leonel closed his eyes, steadying his breathing and his heart rate.\nHe had already promised himself to remain calm in all things. It was still hard since he was just an 18 year old boy, but not everyone was made perfect in a day. In time, he'd temper his disposition.\nAfter Leonel steadied himself, he began thinking of what could possibly be happening here.\nHe doubted that the Brazinger Clan had come in after them, there was a high probability they had come here first. In that case, could it be the Force Eruption was predicted by them? Or was it that they wanted to take advantage of the ore treasury that was this hive?\n'There's another possibility as well…' Leonel furrowed his brows. '… According to Old Hutch, things aren't so simple as they seem on the surface. Could it be that these Project Hunt Islands were never the sole property of the Slayer Legion to begin with?'\nWhen Leonel had this thought, he felt that his whole world had been turned upside down.\nHutch seemed to talk like the decision to let the commoners of the Paradise Islands die was a mutual decision. Was the relationship between the rebels and The Empire really so simple?\nThe more Leonel thought about it, the more confused he became.\n'Forget it, thinking about it myself won't get me anywhere. I'll observe them first.'\n…\nThe space on the other side of the cracks really did seem like an entirely different world. It felt as though one had to step inside a spatial crack to reach it, but the truth of the matter was that it was within the hive just like every place else.\nThough the space was dark much like the other network of tunnels, there was a dim halo of light around it. This light didn't come from the sun, but rather the countless plants littered all around!\nThat was right, this space within the hive looked no different than a garden. And, the halos of light being emitted from the plants were none other than the halos natural treasures had in the presence of a lower Dimensional world!\nThere didn't seem to be any large source of water anywhere within the cave, making their existence baffling. The only hints of liquid were the drippings that fell from the stalactites on the ceiling.\n'Mellow Dew Stalactites!'\nLeonel trembled slightly.\nMellow Dew Stalactites could form a single drop a day. Each one of these drops were the greatest nourishment for natural treasures, whether those natural treasures were plants like the ones in this cave space, or the current ores in Leonel's possession.\nThe dew drops also had exceptionally high concentrations of Force. They could essentially liquefy Force, creating what could be classified as a Force Strengthening Deviation despite the fact it had no other characteristics aside from its high concentrations.\nJust to put these matters into perspective, just a single drop from these Stalactites was enough to form any one of Leonel's Stars. This was how exaggerated the matter was.\nYet, the ceiling of this place was formed by at least 50 Mellow Dew Stalactites. It was no wonder this place didn't need any water to grow so many wonderful plants. A single drop of that dew would be enough to raise even an acre of Fourth Dimensional plants without issue.\nUnfortunately, Leonel didn't know what these plants were. He could tell they were valuable, but he wasn't a Force Pill Refiner, so how could he know anything about them? Luckily, he could rely on the dictionary if need be. He was certain these higher Dimensional plants were in its database.\n\"Wow, I didn't think we'd find something like this. How do you think these plants managed to grow here?\"\nThere were two men, both of similar stature. They seemed to realize they had stumbled upon something valuable, but they didn't know how valuable it was. Their knowledge was limited. All they knew was that due to all these halos of light, these were definitely at least Fourth Dimensional herbs.\n\"Let's mark this place down and let the Young Lord know about it. Right now, the priority is still to find a path toward the Force Crystal Mine. We're running out of time.\"\nLeonel's gaze flashed. 'Young Lord? Could he be talking about that monocle guy?'\nA hardly concealed rage flashed through Leonel's gaze. He had always been one who found it difficult to kill. It was only after countless battles that his heart began to slowly accept the kind of world he lived in now. However, if there was someone he wouldn't hesitate to kill, two someones, actually… it was the Junior Governor Duke and that monocle wearing young lord of the Brazinger Clan.\n'It seems they split up to cover more ground. Their aim is also the Force Crystal Mine… I can't guarantee that monocle wearing bastard won't be interested enough in this place to set everything aside to come here first. These two might not know the value of Mellow Dew Stalictite, but that doesn't mean he won't…'\nA resolute glint took hold of Leonel's gaze. Though he was injured, he was still confident in taking on these two. Plus, if he could capture them, he might be able to dig out more information about what the Brazinger Clan was doing here and if they had any connection to the Slayer Legion…\n'No, they shouldn't have a connection, or else we wouldn't have been sent here at this time.'\nEven as Leonel was thinking this, he had already sprung into action. Taking advantage of the darkness, he stealthily had Little Tolly devour the thin, cracked wall and rolled into the world of grass and plants.\nWithout hesitation, he quickly followed after the two men who had just left the wide space of greenery.",

      "content": "Leonel looked down toward two unconscious men. He had already guessed that taking them down wouldn't have been a problem, but even he hadn't expected it to be so easy. In fact, it could be said that he was a bit too heavy handed.\nHowever, Leonel hadn't had a choice. This whole knocking people out and taking hostages things was completely new to him. TV shows always made it look so easy. Just a simple karate chop to the back of the neck, right? So why had it given him such a headache?\n'Forget it. I'll use those vines to tie them up in the Segmented Cube and bring them back.'\n\"How do I harvest these plants?\" Leonel asked.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, the best choice is to make use of the Segmented Cube's Suspended Animation ability. ]\n'Suspended Animation?' Leonel was confused for a second before he understood. 'Oh… It must mean the snowglobes.'\nThe snowglobes of the Lab Setting had always been a mystery to Leonel. At first, he had thought there was a finite number. But, after he had collected the corpses of a couple hundred beasts, he realized that the 'snowglobes' multiplied without end. It seemed there would always be enough for his needs.\nAlso, he realized that corpses weren't the only thing he could hold in them. All of the ores he had collected had been taken in by them as well.\n\"What exactly does the Suspended Animation ability do?\" Leonel asked.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Suspended Animation: Phase One ability of the Segmented Cube's Lab Setting. It is able to house the living and the dead in the exact state they entered as no matter how much time has passed, evading the harshness of the passage of time. ]\nLeonel nodded. This was about what he had expected. His spatial bracelet could somewhat replicate this feat, but it wasn't the exact same.\nThe reason why things in his spatial bracelet were non-perishable was because living things couldn't exist within it. As a result, there was no bacteria or fungi, so how could things go 'bad'?\nBut, from the explanation of the dictionary, it seemed that the ability of the snowglobes was far more profound than this. It also didn't seem like it restricted the living either.\n'This is perfect. I was worrying about how I would store all these plants, but if this is the case there shouldn't be a problem.'\nThough everything seemed to be going smoothly initially, Leonel was soon lamenting his plight. Unfortunately, the space within each snowglobe was limited. So, he had to uproot each plant individually before moving on.\nHow could this not leave him feeling aggrieved? If the Lab Setting could produce these snowglobes endlessly, why couldn't it make one with more space in it?\nSoon, Leonel realized that it wasn't a matter of space. Despite the bear king being over five meters tall, it still fit in one. Yet, these plants, root and all, were barely a foot tall in most cases, but they took up an entire snowglobe to themselves.\nIt seemed that the ability of the Suspended Animation wasn't as simple as Leonel thought. It was likely that the snowglobe was capable of perfectly adapting to the object it took in, adjusting its settings appropriately depending on the item.\nUnsurprisingly, it took Leonel several hours to take in every plant. It would have been faster, but he didn't want to accidentally harm them. So, he could only move slowly.\nSoon, the garden had fallen into darkness, the only hint of light coming from the shimmering stalactites above.\nLeonel gasped for breath, stretching out his back.\n'Plundering treasures is actually such hard work…'\nThough he said this, he looked around the garden with a sigh. Who knew how many years it had taken for it to reach this state?\nHe wanted to take away the soil beneath his feet and the stalactite on the ceiling of the space, but he really had no means to. It had already taken him so long just to uproot the plants, how could he shovel all this soil into the Segmented Cube? Even aside from that, he had no idea where to even begin with the stalactites. They were easily 20 meters above him and each the size of a tall human man.\nJust when Leonel felt that he could only leave such treasures behind, the Segmented Cube appeared on its own again. It separated into its jigsaw-like puzzles and shot across the room, enveloping it completely.\nLeonel blinked and by the time his vision cleared, the once beautiful garden had become just as bland as every other cave in this place. The only hint that it was once something more were the vines and lush patches of moss that covered the walls.\n'…'\nLeonel was speechless. If it could do this, why the hell had it let him waste so many hours here?\n'Forget it, forget it…'\nAll the things his father left him were too mischievous. He couldn't help but feel that they were making fun of him at every corner.\n'Let's clear out the ores in this network of tunnels then return to the group. I shouldn't leave them for so long…'\nLeonel didn't hesitate any longer. He didn't know how long it would take for the rest of the Brazinger Clan to notice the absence of their two family members, so he worked quickly, exploring the new network of tunnels.\nHis luck was great. He managed to find a Water Elemental Vessel. Though it would have been better to find a Dual Water-Earth Elemental Vessel, having a Water and an Earth Elemental Vessel was definitely the second best option.\nHe also found more Vein Ores that would give him greater flexibility in the Force Arts he could draw and even found a few large deposits of Urbe Ores. It was clear that this network of tunnels was more greatly influenced by the Force Eruption and thus had more treasures.\nAs expected from this conclusion, Leonel found that this network of tunnels had several paths leading several tens of meters downward.\n'Since this is the case, it'll be easier to make it to the Force Crystal Mine if this is our starting point…'\nLeonel quickly made his way back to where the garden once was. Then, making use of the vines and bits of moss that remained, he cleverly covered up the hole he had come from. Afterward, he made his way back to the cave the youths had taken as their base.",

      "content": "\"Wake up.\"\nLeonel spoke coldly, pouring a bucket of frigid water he had gotten from Pisces over the heads of the two Brazinger Clan members.\nIn truth, Leonel had no need to get his water from Pisces, he only did it as a show. Since he had the Black Grade Soothing Waters pool, he was much better off than those drinking normal water.\nStill, he made a show of politely asking Pisces for water everyday to try and smooth her attitude out a bit. Like this, it was much easier to maintain the balance of the group and it made her feel more comfortable thinking she had a modicum of power over him.\nThough, if Pisces knew that the 'precious' water she so 'graciously' bestowed to Leonel was being used in this way, it could be imagined how she would react.\nThe two Brazinger Clan men were startled awake.\nTheir first attempt was to move, but upon realizing their hands and feet were bound, a tinge of fear colored their hearts.\nLeonel wasn't worried that one of their abilities could help them escape. Before he woke them up, he had the dictionary scan them. The one with the more square jaw had an auxiliary type ability that made his neurons fire faster, thus giving him greater reaction time and greater thinking speed. The one with the slightly thinner face had a vibration type ability. This one was a greater threat, but Leonel had already crafted the cuffs on his hands to be beyond his ability to vibrate out of.\nAfter realizing that the two of them had been captured, the two clan members glared toward Leonel. But, inwardly they were feeling confused. There were others here? How was this possible?\n\"First, tell me your names.\" Leonel asked simply.\nAfter a while, it became obvious to Leonel that they had no intention of responding to him. But, seemingly having expected this result, he only nonchalantly nodded.\nWith a wave of his hand, the poisoned corpse of the bear king appeared, causing the two men to pale.\n\"This poison is pretty tyrannical, don't you think?\" Leonel said casually.\nAfter a few moments, he stood and pulled the thinner man away. At such a sight, the square jawed man trembled violently, the fear evident in his eyes.\n\"No! No! I'll tell you my name, I'll tell you my name!\"\nUnforunately, no matter how hard he struggled, he and Leonel still vanished, leaving the square jawed man in a sorry state. He was so scared that he directly fainted, unable to maintain his consciousness. However, he had no idea that Leonel and the thin faced man had simply gone to the Abode Setting, letting his fear stew.\n\"Oh, you'll tell me your name now?\" Leonel asked.\n\"Yes! Yes! My name is Cheri!\"\nA weird expression coated Leonel's visage at these words. Cheri? That meant darling in French… The man sure had quite the… unique name.\n\"Alright then Cheri, I have a few questions to ask you, you'll answer them honestly, right?\"\n\"Right, right!\"\n\"Good.\" Leonel nodded in satisfaction. \"It would be a shame if the stories of you and your partner didn't add up, right?\"\nHearing this, Cheri's trembling became several times more violent. He had indeed only planned to tell Leonel part of the truth. But, what if his partner didn't tell the same lie he did? Then, wouldn't he be asking for his own death?\nThis kid was so sinister!\nHe suddenly understood why it was Leonel had separated them. It wasn't so that he could kill him, but rather so that they would have no idea what story the other told. Like this, if they wanted to live, they would have no choice but to say the truth because the truth was the only thing they could guarantee the other would know.\nHaving thought this far, any thoughts of struggle the man had suddenly crumbled.\nHe was a member of the Brazinger Clan, how could his will really be so fragile? Unlike those who grew up in Earth's common society, they from hidden families had completely different upbringings. They had been ready for the descent of the Metamorphosis since long ago and had begun training since their birth. That included him despite the fact he was only from a branch family.\nMuch of his fear had just been an act to get Leonel to lower his guard, maybe then he could find a chance to escape. But, who knew this teenage boy would be so cunning?\nSeeing Cheri's flickering gaze, Leonel grinned, causing the former to shudder.\n\"My name is Jian, my name is Jian. Please forgive me.\"\nLeonel laughed at this. So this Jian was trying to make fun of him by having him call him Cheri? What a conniving fellow indeed.\nJian shivered. He had no idea if his partner would expose his name as a lie, so how could he continue to hold back?\n\"Good.\"\nLeonel walked to the bath house that held the Soothing Waters Pool and threw Jian against the tiles. Then, he found a stool and sat down.\nJian's shivering grew fiercer. This time, he didn't have to fake it. What place could be more convenient for clearing up a dead body in comparison to a bathroom?\n\"Since we're both on the same page, there's really no problem, right? I can see that you're not a useless person, so you already know that everything I ask you, I will ask your partner. Be sure to be honest with me. After all, I may not have a great ability, but the one thing I do have is a great memory.\"\nJian nodded outwardly, but inwardly, he was cursing. Didn't have a great ability? He took them both down before they even knew what was happening. They didn't even have a chance to use their abilities before their worlds went black. How was this not having a great ability?\n\"Alright, first question. Did that monocle wearing bastard come here with you?\"\nJian's eyes widened. The killing intent coming from Leonel enveloped him completely, causing his heart to shudder.\nThis young man knew about their Young Lord? What relationship did he have with him? Could he be from one of the other hidden families? Did they catch onto their Young Lord's plans?\nAccording to the agreement, only the younger generation of their families' main branches could interact with the world until the Fourth Dimensional Metamorphosis was complete, so could this kid be a Young Lord from another hidden family?",

      "content": "\"I'll take that as a yes.\"\nLeonel's icy voice woke Jian from his thoughts. He could only shut his mouth, keeping his mumbling to himself. He didn't know what his Young Lord had done to piss this young man off so much, but he could tell that he should refrain from asking.\n\"What did you come here for?\"\nJian gulped. \"Our Young Lord didn't tell us much. All we know is that there's a Force Crystal Mine and that the Young Lord needs it for some reason.\"\n\"How did you get in here through the beasts? Is there another entrance to the hive?\"\nJian's gaze flashed with a peculiar light. But, remembering that Leonel would ask this same question to his partner, he could only throw all thoughts of lying to the back of his mind.\n\"… Those beasts are under the control of Young Lord.\"\n\"What?\"\nLeonel couldn't hide his shock. At the same time, a cold sweat permeated his back. That monocle wearing bastard actually had such an ability? That's impossible. Leonel remembered very clearly that he had already asked the dictionary to read out his ability.\nFrom what Leonel remembered, their Young Lord's ability was of the SS-grade. He had the ability to change the genetic information of a target. Judging by the fact his subordinates were weremen, Leonel assumed that in order to change this genetic information, he needed to take it from another source.\nBut, none of this had anything to do with controlling beasts. Could it be that his ability evolved? Or could it be part of his original ability? Or maybe it was someone under his command who had such an ability?\nLeonel's mind was spinning.\nThe level of danger such a fact brought was unimaginable. With the control of six, now five, Elite S-grade threats, Simeon was practically invincible. And, there was no telling if he had other beasts following along with him now. Leonel didn't believe that he would really enter without the slightest hint of protection.\nWhile Leonel was thinking, Jian didn't dare to even breathe too loudly. The aura coming off the boy in front of him made him shiver to his core.\n\"He has the ability to control beasts? How long has he had this ability for?\"\nLeonel's question didn't make sense on the surface, but while his mind was wandering, he caught onto the faint inkling of something. If his thoughts were correct, a lot of things would suddenly make sense.\n\"This… It should be recent. The Young Lord has been running a lot of experiments lately, trying to iron out the kinks in this ability. He only perfected it a few weeks ago…\"\nLeonel's eyes narrowed. \"The gorilla man who attacked the Slayer Legion at the shore that day… That was him, right?\"\nJian was shocked. Seeing this, Leonel didn't need him to answer, he knew it was the truth.\nThe matters of that day hadn't made any sense to him before. Why would a man with an A-grade threat level throw his life away so randomly? He attacked Damian's unit seemingly without cause or purpose, leading to his eventual death.\nBut, after that, they couldn't find any clues about him. Not only was there not a shred of anything on his person, he wasn't recognized as having a grudge with anyone in the Slayer Legion either.\nNone of it made any sense…\nBut… What if one looked at it from a different angle? What if that man was just a guinea pig? What if he was Simeon's way of testing whether or not he could force others to throw their lives away at his command?\nThe more Leonel thought, the colder the chill in his heart became. This Simeon… Really deserved death.\nAt the same time, there was a hint of fear that blossomed in Leonel. Such an ability, it was too treacherous. If Simeon could really manipulate one's genes such that they had to obey his every command… just what kind of power could he wield if he was allowed to run amock? What would happen if Aina had really landed in his hands?\n'He needs to die.'\nA frigid aura permeated the bathhouse. Leonel had already sentenced Simeon to death. He wouldn't allow that bastard to leave this hive alive.\n\"How close are you all to finding the path to the Force Eruption?\"\nJian coughed, clearing his throat.\n\"We've only explored about 30% of the entrances, but the deepest one only goes about 50 meters below the surface. The Young Lord told us to mark down any unique caverns we found and report to him in a week…\"\nLeonel's sneer deepened. \"What kind of protection does that bastard have?\"\n\"The Young Lord has his elite guards with him, they've all been genetically enhanced. Not a single one is weaker than an S-grade threat. There are nine of them and they follow him around everywhere. Even when we split up, it was only us ordinary guards that left the group. The rest remained with him.\"\nLeonel's eyes narrowed. So many S-grade threats was definitely beyond his means. And, from what Jian said, that was their floor. Who was to say there weren't a few beyond that?\nFor the first time, Leonel felt frustrated with his ability. He was maybe the only person on Earth with an ability that surpassed the SSS-grade, but because it was only auxiliary, the amount of strength it provided him was limited. If his ability was of the same grade but of the offensive nature instead, just how much power would he have?\nLeonel really didn't want to let that bastard go, but the more he grilled Jian about the protection his Young Lord had, the more he realized that he couldn't take Simeon lightly.\nThe most ironic part was that this was likely his fault. A couple months ago, when he first met Simeon, he hadn't had this kind of protection around him. That bullet Leonel almost put through his skull is probably precisely the reason he was so cautious now.",

      "content": "Leonel grilled Jian with several more questions then knocked him out and dragged him back into the Lab Setting. Without a word to his partner, he threw him into one of the snowglobes, causing no small shock to the square jawed man.\nNot wanting to end up like Jian, how could he not go all out in an attempt to satisfy Leonel? But the truth remained the same. In the end, he too was knocked out once more and thrown into a snowglobe.\nLeonel took a deep breath and sat down, his mind running.\nThough he could have asked the two about Aina's past, he decided against it. This was something he wanted Aina to tell him herself. It just wouldn't feel the same if someone else had to tell him. Plus, he wanted to respect her boundaries.\nThat said, even aside from that, the heavy pressure Simeon brought him was beyond his imagination.\nWhat a joke he was. He had a Tier 3 Bronze ability, but he was being pushed into a corner by a Tier 8 Black ability. He was sure that if his father knew he would never hear the end of it.\nLeonel shook his head, staring blankly into space. After a while, his vacant eyes gained a steely coldness.\n'I'm certain that Simeon's ability didn't originally have anything related to control. The reason he can now is because he's mastered his ability to the point of squeezing out all of its potential, eventually allowing him to gain this new branch ability. I don't believe for a second that he can do something that I can't.'\nThe 'branch' abilities of Leonel's main ability seemed to have awoken randomly. First it was Dream World, then it was Dream Sculpt.\nOn the surface, both appeared without rhyme or reason, but was this really the case?\nDream World appeared to him when he really wanted to calculate the best orientation of his Force Nodes. This will eventually allowed him to gain his ability to simulate matters in his mind.\nDream Sculpt appeared when he wanted to find a way to make use of the treasures he wasn't allowed to take outside of the Zone. This will eventually allowed him the ability to ingrain perfect and permanent thoughts into his Dream World.\nThere was even the third ability he only recently named, Dream Clone. That ability was birthed when he really wanted to learn the primitive man's combat style as quickly as possible. This allowed him to split his mind and learn the same technique many times faster.\nEvery time he needed an ability within his means, it felt as though he could produce it as long as these things fell within the purview of his Dream World.\nSimeon's ability was a wakeup call to Leonel. He realized now that abilities weren't immutable things. They were made to grow and evolve along with their host. Why else would Leonel's ability still be growing even now? It was likely that it would still grow into the future.\nLeonel took a deep breath. 'That's right, I need to open myself up to more possibilities…'\nLeonel shook his head furiously. To think that he really almost had thoughts of letting that bastard off for now.\nAbsolutely not. He would make this hive Simeon's grave.\nAfter a while, Leonel stood.\n\"I have so many materials and even more Beast Crystals. If I can't make something to get out of this situation, I might as well not go and find Aina at all.\"\nLeonel had already decided. There would be three keys to his success.\nFirst, he would definitely find the path to the Force Eruption faster. There was most definitely an even greater treasure trove waiting for him.\nSecond, he wouldn't hesitate any longer. He would form his Seventh and Eighth Node. Continually doubting himself wouldn't get him anywhere. Maybe after doing this, he would find some clues about his Ninth Node.\nIf worse came to worst, he would just abandon all of his Force Nodes. Though there was a massive taboo against doing so, the price was comparatively shallow for those in the lowest Third Dimension, only after stepping into the Fourth or higher would abandoning one's Force Nodes become akin to a death sentence without incredibly special circumstances.\nAnd third…\nLeonel's mind drifted toward the first Dream Sculpt he ever made. It seemed like a simple golden staff, missing its flag. But, Leonel knew quite well the kind of devastation this thing could cause.\nLeonel knew better than to use this staff to control humans. He had seen how badly Joan ended up with his own two eyes. And, back then, she had only been controlling normal humans.\nBy extension, Leonel also knew that controlling high ranking beasts with it would be foolish as well. Those beast kings had already awoken their intelligence and thus had strong wills of their own. If Leonel tried to take control of them, his ending would be just like Joans.\nHowever… what about those weaker beasts who were only following the beast kings out of fear for their power? Just how quickly had the bear beasts beneath the bear king abandoned him after he died?\nAccording to Jian and his partner, Quinn, Simeon should have only taken control of the beast kings then used them as a proxy to control the other beast hordes.\nPlus, those beast kings definitely had their hands full holding off the tide of beasts coming from the ocean even as Leonel stood here. In that case…\nLeonel smiled coldly. If Simeon thought of using the beast hordes against him, he would be in for a rude awakening.\n**\nOut on the sea, the Commanders of the Eastern and Southern Lookout were still fighting for their lives. Though, those with Commander Violet Rain were definitely fairing much better.\n\"I did it! I managed to get a message through!\" Mellow Trees roared with happiness he never thought he would have over such a simple matter.\nViolet Rain's smile bloomed. Though they didn't get a response because the link was swiftly cut off again, this much was enough. Now, they just had to wait.\nWhat they forgot to consider was the fact the one in charge of their Southern Lookout now was Hacker Hutch… Who knew what maddening ways that senile old man would respond to such a call for help…",

      "content": "A week later, Leonel stepped out from the Segmented Cube. His features seemed quite haggard, an unkempt beard 'gracing' his jaw and his messy dirty blond hair sweeping across his shoulders. But, his eyes remained as sharp as swords.\nWhen the youths noticed Leonel's appearance, they all perked up, traces of anticipation painted on their faces.\nLeonel smiled lightly. \"I've succeeded.\"\nThey were simple words, but they alone made the youths feel that a massive burden had been lifted from their chests.\n\"There's no time to waste.\" Leonel said with a confident air. \"We've already long since decided who would go and who would stay. Let's move out if you're all prepared.\"\nThe lineup that chose to follow Leonel was quite interesting. Thunderous Clap, Roaring Black Lion and Flowing Wind all stood to move with him.\nThunderous Clap's ability was similar to Jian's vibration ability, but much stronger by several levels. The mysterious Quake Force he used could be considered a Force Strengthening Deviation, so he would be joining.\nIn addition, Flowing Wind, despite being from the Eastern Lookout, was also willing to help. Her Wind Elemental Force output was a level beyond Chasing Wind's. In addition, she had much more auxiliary applications to her ability like the power to use wind to scout out her surroundings. So, she was an ideal choice.\nFinally, there was Roaring Black Lion. Among the remaining youths, he had the strongest defenses. In addition, there was no guarantee they wouldn't run into beasts on their journey. His ability to dampen their strength would be greatly useful.\nAs for the rest of the top rankers, they stayed behind to protect the group from any unforeseen circumstances. It was simply impossible for them to take so many with them.\nWith that, the group of four set off.\n\"We're going to cross over into another network of tunnels. I found this place while I was looking for ores previously.\" Leonel explained as he quickly made his way toward the hole he had created a week prior.\nHe knew that he was running out of time. Much of the reason he left Pisces and the others behind was because he was afraid of this hole being found.\nAccording to Jian and Quinn, they were meant to report in a week. When they didn't report as they were meant to, Simeon would most definitely check in on the network of tunnels they were assigned to. By then, there was no guarantee that this hole wouldn't be found.\nIt wasn't long before Leonel had led their group of four to the hole, crossed to the other side, and diligently covered it back up again.\nAfter he was done, he dashed forward again, snaking through the tunnels as though the map of their pathways was tattooed to the back of his hand. Soon, he made it to his destination: the point with the most direct path to the Force Crystal Mine.\nLeonel came to a sudden stop at a seemingly ordinary wall and turned back toward Thunderous Clap, Roaring Black Lion and Flowing Wind.\n\"Before we go, I have something to tell you three. I didn't tell the others because I didn't want them to panic, but it's best you three know in advance.\"\nThe three looked toward Leonel. Seeing his serious expression, they too became serious. Would things not be so simple?\n\"There is another group of people in here aside from us. In fact, earlier, I had captured and interrogated two of them. It's very possible that we could run into them.\n\"I believe that we're ahead of them, but it's best to be cautious. I suspect that there might be another path toward the Force Crystal Mine, I'm just not entirely certain. I just have a feeling that the valleys weren't created without reason…\"\nThe three youths frowned.\nThe complex network of valleys was precisely the reason they could only enter the center of the island through one passageway. They wrapped around the center of the island such that there was only one path forward.\nEven beyond that, Flowing Wind actually had no ability to fly over it. She felt that the Force was incredibly volatile in that area, making it difficult for her to steady her ability properly. When she realized this, she hadn't dared to continue forward, lest she fall to her death.\nIf the valleys were the result of some odd phenomenon related to the Force Crystal Mine… their odd attributes would be much easier to accept.\nOnly when the three nodded seriously did Leonel flip his palm, causing many things to appear.\n\"First, each one of you take these.\"\nLeonel handed each of them silvery-green mouthpieces that looked somewhat like a cross between a flute and a whistle.\n\"These are my creations. I made them out of Whispering Breeze Ore. They're only Tier 1 Black Grade treasures, but they allow you to breathe under water and earth for three hours. After that, you'll need to allow it to recharge for half an hour before you can use it again.\"\nThe three nodded in understanding, watching as Leonel continued to take out nine total resplendent blue scales.\n\"These are another set of my creations, three to the each of you. They're refined from the coy fish's scales, they could be able to form an artificial Force Skin that melds and amplifies with your own. By my calculations, they should each be able to last half an hour under the full pressure of the Force Eruption. I'm not sure how long it will take us to stop the Force Eruption… we'll have to play it by ear.\"\nLeonel took a deep breath and turned back to face the wall, putting the silver mouthpiece between his lips.\n\"Stick close to me.\" Though his words had come out in a mumble, they still managed to understand him.\nLeonel could only roll his eyes when he felt two soft mounds of flesh press against his back. Who else could it be if not Flowing Wind? Could this be considered sexual harassment?\nLeonel didn't have time to spend on the matter as an intricate ring on his finger glowed. Just like this, the seemingly solid wall before him became akin to a curtain of mud.\nHe pushed through it with slightly more difficulty than it would take to walk underwater. Still, it wasn't too bad. The only disadvantage was that he couldn't see anything and his Internal Sight was severely restricted in this kind of environment. However, he could rely on his obscene calculation abilities to maintain his sense of direction with relative ease.\nLike this, the four youths formed a train, the three to Leonel's back closely following by linking their arms. What was especially magical, though, was that the wall of earth they left the range of reverted back to their original states soon after.\nThough Leonel could see nothing but a vast darkness before him, he could feel himself getting closer.\nHe kept his hand in the lead, ready for it to enter clear air once again. And, a moment later, that was exactly what happened.\nLeonel felt the resistance against his hand suddenly vanish and came to a grinding halt.\n'Argh…'\nLeonel wanted to groan, but he kept it in. He felt a sharp pain in his hand as though it could be lacerated to minced meat in but another few moments.\nWithout hesitation, he pressed his first coy fish scale against his body, causing a radiant blue to cover him like a thin layer of skin. He had already long since taken off his chain necklace, saving it for a critical moment.\nAfter this, using his hand, he extended his Soul Force forward, stretching his Internal Sight outward.\nWhat he saw made him grind his teeth in anger.\nThere was a vast underground space. Its ceilings were at least 100 meters tall and it was over a kilometer from end to end. It was filled with shimmering crystals so bright that had Leonel been looking at them with his eyes, he was sure he would have to squint.\nOf course, all of these dimensions were just Leonel's approximate guesses. The Force was so volatile that his Internal Sight was incredibly fuzzy. The sharp range was severely reduced, causing his calculations to be lacking.\nWhat had made him angry, though, was the fact that there was someone who had gotten here before him. More accurately, there was a beast that had gotten here before him.\nLeonel's hand had appeared near the ceiling of the wide space. So, if he stepped out now, he would fall 100 meters to his death. Down below, there was an adorable creature, taking a nap without a care in the world.\nIts fur was a lustrous black, its whiskers and small nose twitching as though it was having a particularly good dream.\nIts body was long in considered of its proportions. It had such a small head, but it was easily a foot and a half from head to toe.\nThis adorable creature was actually a little black furred mink. But, despite having never seen it in its true form before, Leonel couldn't help but grind his teeth.\nThis little bastard was definitely the beast that had been harassing him for so long.",

      "content": "Leonel suppressed his annoyance in his heart. He would definitely deal with that annoying little mink, but he also had to be cautious.\nFor one, that little mink could somehow sleep within that torrent of energy without any problems while he had simply stretched out a hand into it yet almost couldn't withstand the pain.\nSecondly, after so many days of battle with the little mink, Leonel knew that it most definitely wasn't simple to deal with. He even felt that its danger level was a level beyond the beast kings outside. He was thankful that all of their exchanges had lasted for a short time, or else maybe he would have been on the losing end far more times than he wanted to admit.\n'Why can it just sleep there so easily? Didn't the dictionary say the only way to survive in this environment was Force Skin? It doesn't look like that little bastard is using it…'\nThe little mink seemed to have a cloud of black fog perpetually hanging around its body, but this wasn't exactly like Force Skin at all.\n'It must be its innate ability… That means its Dark Element Force Strengthening Deviation might also comes from its innate ability…'\nLeonel took a deep breath. He couldn't consider this any longer.\nNow that he knew there was this beast guarding the Force Crystal Mine, he knew that he had to take it out. He didn't know why, but this little mink loved to attack him. Maybe the little guy thought it was a joke, but Leonel's life had been on the line every time. He couldn't take any chances.\nAfter making a decision, Leonel started slowly descending. He had appeared too high, if he stepped out now, he would just fall to his death. But, if he went too low, his treasure would likely stop working.\nThe entire floor and much of the sides of the open space were covered with Force Crystals radiating resplendent lights. All the way here, Leonel had to navigate around ore veins because he knew his treasure wouldn't work against high level minerals. Obviously, the same went for Force Crystals.\nUnable to communicate with the others, Leonel had no choice but to make an explosive move. With Flowing Wind positioned right behind him, he believed that she would be able to stop their fall with her ability, albeit shakily considered how volatile the Force here was.\nLeonel leapt out from the wall. Force and sharp winds whipped against his body as he fell down toward the sleeping black-furred mink.\nWith a flip of his palms, two pistols appeared, both outfitted with harpoons. This time, he had no intention of holding back. If he could kill this beast before it woke up, that would be for the best.\nBANG! BANG!\nLeonel's gaze lit up. He knew his shots hit the mark. And, from start to finish, the little mink hadn't moved. In fact, it seemed that his shots were so powerful that it directly blasted apart the platform of Force Crystals the little mink had been sleeping on too. But, this made sense. After all, compared to those massive beasts outside, this little guy was really small. It was no surprise Leonel's attack went right through it like that.\nLeonel landed heavily on the ground, a jolt of pain shooting through his legs as his blueish Force Skin fluctuated wildly beneath the pressure of the Force Eruption.\nHe shook the stinging sensation out of his lower half. It seemed that his fall had quite an impact on him, he should have definitely used his treasure shoes. But, he had been saving them in case the little mink woke up in time and made a move on him. If that happened, he would have needed his shoes to dodge, or else he would have been a sitting duck in the air.\nHowever, Leonel could have never expected what he witnessed next.\nWhen he looked up, he was stunned silent. The little mink was still there, sleeping its time away as though nothing had happened.\nThe two darts Leonel had shot out were still there as well. One went through the little mink's head and the other went through its body. However…\nIt was like the little mink was an illusion or in a completely different reality. Its body seemed corporeal, but Leonel attack went through it as though it had no substance at all, almost as though this was just a projection and not a living creature.\n'What the hell…'\nLeonel's heart tightened.\nAt that moment, Flowing Wind unsteadily dropped to the ground, carrying Roaring Black Lion and Thunderous Clap along with her. Her control over her ability was extremely poor in this place, but it was at least enough to slow their descent. Either way, Leonel hadn't brought her here for her combat prowess, but rather to help in quickening the maturity of the Force Crystal Core.\n\"You… why'd you kill such an adorable little guy?\"\nFlowing Wind reprimanded Leonel without the slightest hint of her previous lusty personality. In the blink of an eye, she had suddenly become a mother hen protecting her chicks.\nLeonel almost couldn't refrain from lashing out. Adorable? This little bastard had almost killed him who knows how many times?\nAfter a while, Flowing Wind and the others also noticed the oddity. If such a small creature was hit with such force, shouldn't it be a rain of blood and guts by now? Why did it seem like Leonel's darts had been embedded into its body?\n\"It's incorporeal? Is it fake?\" Thunderous Clap muttered.\n\"I don't think it's fake…\" Leonel said slowly. \"… But don't be fooled by its appearance. This little thing almost killed me several times.\"\nThe eyes of the three youths widened. Almost killed Leonel? Which of them didn't know how powerful Leonel was? Yet, such a small beast was a danger to him?\nHearing such words, they could only put their guards up.\n\"I didn't get a chance to do this before because it was too fast, but maybe now…? Tell me about its abilities.\" The dictionary appeared in Leonel's palm as his eyes narrowed with seriousness.\n[ *Ping* Evolved life form detected. ]\n[Simplified Title: Mink]\n[State: Evolved … Evolving]\n[ Abilities: … *Ping* Generating nomenclature… ]\n[ Shadow World: An ability that takes control of the world hidden from the stars. ]\n[ Evaluating power… *Ping* ]\n[ Evolution Stage: Elite Tier 9 Black ]",

      "content": "Leonel involuntarily held his breath.\nThis description… It was the simplest he had ever seen. It was also the most vague he had ever seen. The only description he had seen that carried this level of vagueness was his own. His own only became more detailed after he began using the dictionary to document his ability, which is why it now had a breakdown of all his abilities from Dream World to Dream Clone. But initially…\n[ Calcualtive Mind: An ability capable of simplifying the complex. ]\nThis was what the dictionary had first told him about his ability. It never said anything about his Dream World, Dream Sculpt or Dream Clone ability. Aside from himself, he had never seen an ability as simply explained as the little mink's Shadow World.\nBut, what also shocked Leonel was the 'state' of the little mink. Not only did it say 'Evolved' but it also said 'Evolving'.\nThe little mink's ability was already classified with the Elite Tier 9 Black level. If it evolved, wouldn't it cross over into the Bronze level just like Leonel?\nLeonel took a deep breath to steady his beating heart.\nUnlike him, the Little Mink's ability seemed exceptional for combat. Leonel couldn't even touch it despite the fact it was sleeping right in front of him. How was it even possible to do anything to this little guy?\nJust with this ability alone, the little mink was untouchable in Fourth Dimensional Worlds. Only under the suppression of a Fifth Dimensional World would its ability begin to show some weaknesses. But, considering it was currently evolving into the Bronze tiers, it seemed that this wouldn't be true for long…\nLeonel decided to leave his darts in place. He didn't dare to approach the little mink too closely anymore. But, he also knew that it was simply impossible for them to just leave now. Their success would decide the life and death of tens of people.\n\"How long will it take this little thing to finish evolving?\" Leonel asked.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, 3:21:51:05 ]\n'3 days, 21 hours, 51 minutes and 5 seconds huh… Hopefully that's enough.'\nLeonel chose to go with the assumption that the little mink would stay asleep for as long as it was evolving. In that case, maybe they would have enough time to help the Force Crystal Mine mature.\n\"Let's hurry.\" Leonel said, receiving the agreement of the others.\nThe four youths turned their attention toward the raging tempest of white, gushing Force toward the center of the wide space.\nThe mine was over a kilometer in width and length. Of that space, the geyser took up barely 20 meters of width. But, its presence was imposing.\nIt was an odd feeling. Unlike geysers of water, this Force Eruption hadn't made a single sound after its initial burst. It bore a hole through the network of tunnels above it and remained completely silent, even to the point the youths could easily chat.\n\"Alright, Roaring Black Lion, you'll have to protect Flowing Wind. You all know what to do, right?\"\nThe youths nodded.\nThunderous Clap had a Force cultivating technique and had formed four Nodes. So, his ability to keep up his Force Skin was relatively better. But, Flowing Wind had yet to do so for whatever reason, so she needed the protection of Roaring Black Lion. This was definitely a testament to how great her ability was.\n\"We just pour our Force Strengthening Deviations in, right? Sounds simple enough…\" Flowing Wind mumbled. But, it was clear that she wasn't very confident.\nSteeling their wills, the youths moved forward, approaching the geyser of white from different angles.\nThe moment they crossed the barrier, they realized that things were completely out of their expectations. Let alone the towering danger they expected, it almost felt as though they were walking through a spray of sparkling water on the hottest of summer days.\nHowever, instead of making him feel more relaxed, Leonel's heart clenched as he pushed his way toward the Core.\nThough he disparaged the dictionary sometimes, how could he not trust something his father had left for him? His father was the one person who he trusted with his everything. Even if the things he left behind would sometimes tease him in unexpected ways, they wouldn't ever truly put him in danger.\nSince his father's dictionary put so much emphasis on how dangerous Force Eruptions were, how could Leonel ever take them lightly? The fact things seemed so calm and even relaxing made his hair stand on end.\nThey say that there were forms of death where one would feel incomparably relaxed near the end. Some said that there was no better euphoria than drowning…\nSomething about this Force Eruption reminded Leonel of such things…\nSoon, Leonel had made it to the Force Crystal Core. Without a better descriptor, he could only say that it was beautiful.\nIt was the most perfect sphere Leonel had ever seen. It stood amidst an array of Force Crystals that looked like the petals of a blooming flower. Despite the fact it was the cause of such a shocking event, it was completely still. It was almost impossible to tell that it was the source of all of this at all.\nIt radiated an assortment of colors, shimmering a resplendent rainbow. However, if one looked closely, it was possible to see golden lines being slowly drawn just beneath its surface. These lines seemed to exude an ancient mystery and were even somewhat more resplendent than even the rainbow colors of the Force Crystal Core. If it wasn't hidden beneath the Core's surface, it would definitely easily outshine its radiance.\n'Those must be the Natural Force Arts…'\nLeonel looked up to see three pairs of eyes looking toward him solemnly. It seemed that they felt this matter shouldn't be so simple either.\nLeonel narrowed his eyes and took a step forward, lightly touching the core with a finger.\nImmediately, his expression changed as he quickly retracted his hand. But, it was still too late.\nThe Force Skin protecting his hand burst. Soon after it, the skin on his left hand splintered and shattered into a rain of blood. Even the bones of his fingers were visible to see.\nLeonel's Force quickly surged, pushing the torrent of Force rampaging around within him out with brute force.\nBy the time his heart settled down and he looked toward the Force Crystal Core with a solemn expression, all he could feel was a spine tingling pain from his hand.",

      "content": "Leonel's face slightly twisted in pain. No matter how used he was to injuries by now, the feeling of having his hand practically explode from the inside out left him wanting to cry out.\nThe other three youths looked toward him with fear evident in their eyes. It was just a simple touch, but Leonel's ending had actually been so terrible. If he held on for just a fraction of a second longer, just how much worse would his injuries be?\nLeonel took several deep breaths.\nMaybe the worst part about all of this was the loss of his hand. A Force Crafter's hands were the most important part of their body. With his left hand in this state, it simply wouldn't be possible to craft anything.\n'… I'm too reckless…'\nLeonel clenched his jaw.\n\"Retreat.\"\nLeonel ordered this the moment he saw how helpless the situation was. That break in his Force Skin had shaved off more than half the remaining time the Force Skin treasure he had forged had. It wouldn't be long before it shattered completely. By then, there was no telling how horrible his ending would be.\nHowever, just when he wanted to retreat, Leonel's expression changed.\nIt had been so easy to walk in, but he found that the way out made him feel as though he was walking against quicksand.\nLeonel's expression immediately became ugly. What the hell was going on?\n\"What's going on? I feel like I can't take a step back no matter how much I want to.\"\nRoaring Black Lion's voice held a rare instance of trepidation and fear. This was the very last thing they expected to happen. Why was it so easy to enter but not easy to leave?\n\"It seems I've underestimated this Force Eruption again…\" Leonel smiled bitterly.\nThere were all sorts of natural traps in the world, even before the Metamorphosis. All of them were easy to enter but difficult to leave.\nA Venus flytrap wouldn't have any qualms about allowing a fly onto its petals, but would it so easily allow one to leave? A beast wouldn't hestiate to allow its prey into its mouth, but would it so easily release it?\nThis trap in particular reminded Leonel of a phenomenon that could happen in rivers and dams. Anyone swimming near a dam would be asking for death. The interaction between the rushing water suddenly met by an immovable force would cause a pattern of currents that would easily allow a human in, but make it impossible for them to leave.\nThe number of people who had died to such a phenomenon were too many to count. Leonel had just never expected that the flow of Force here would be able to replicate such a thing.\nLeonel smiled bitterly. \"Sorry guys… It seems I was still a bit reckless.\"\nLeonel sighed. He knew that once again this was a case of the dictionary being very specific with its answers. He asked about how to mature a Force Crystal Core ahead of time, but hadn't asked anything about something like this.\nThe three youths couldn't help but be disappointed. But, how mad could they be? It wasn't as though Leonel had sent them into this danger alone. He had stepped forward first and had even been willing to retreat when things weren't going well. This was something completely out of their expectations.\n\"Don't worry.\" Leonel said firmly after a moment. \"I promise to take you all out of here.\"\nThe resolution in Leonel's voice shocked them. They hadn't expected that even now, he would still take responsibility. Usually, someone with as much power as him would definitely not have the time to care about them now.\nWithout another word, Leonel directly sat on the ground, entering a meditative state. He weakly supported his left hand on his lap, doing his best to ignore the pain.\n'I have almost 30 coy fish scales. Each of them can provide 30 minutes of protection. Between the four of us, that's enough for a bit over three hours and a half.'\nThe three youths looked toward Leonel, then looked at one another. There were clear hints of despair on their faces, but what could they do?\nThunderous Clap tried to fight his way out, throwing out thunderous punches that rocked the air, but he found himself sliding back with every strike.\nFlowing Wind and Roaring Black Lion tried their hands at it too. In fact, the former had the greatest shot and even almost succeeded, trying to ride the flow of Force. But in the end, just when it looked like she might succeed, she was blasted backward. Had it not been for Roaring Black Lion catching her before she landed on the Force Crystal Core, her outcome would have been even sorrier.\nLeonel's mind spun. However, no matter how hard he thought, everything pointed in a singular direction: Force Strengthening Deviations.\nThe only way to overwhelm Force was with Force of greater quantity or quality.\nRight now, he couldn't spare thoughts toward maturing the Force Crystal Core. Wasting stamina on it would just make it so that they were less likely to survive. With only a little over three hours, every small bit of stamina could decide life and death.\n'I need to improve my Light Elemental Force or my Spear Force…'\nLeonel's eyes flashed open. He pushed forward his only good remaining hand, stabbing out toward the edge of the Force Eruption's influence.\nBut, what he saw left him feeling helpless. Even with the amplification of his Spear Force, his [Call of the Wind] only traveled a meter before being shattered completely.\nTaking a deep breath, Leonel attempted to fuse his Light Elemental Force into the attack. It wasn't a perfect fusion, but it was barely enough to gain a small amplification.\nHe pierced out once more, but the result was just as depressing. It barely passed the two and a half meter mark before being crushed. That was still almost a full eight meters from the edge they needed to escape from.\n'The closer to escaping the energy fluctuations it was, the harder it is to cross. The one to two meter distance was at least twice as difficult to cross as the zero to one meter distance… I need to improve…'\nLeonel could only turn his hopes back to the dictionary. It said that there were levels beyond… right?",

      "content": "Leonel turned a complicated glance toward the dictionary in his hands.\n\"Tell me about the levels of Force Strengthening Deviations.\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Force Strengthening Deviations are divided by quality and type. Type can range from Weapon Types to Elemental Types, while quality is decided by Evolution Potential and range of ability, also known as Evolution Branches. ]\n[ Evolution Potential: The potential for improvement. This is decided by the amplification ability of a Force Strengthening Deviation. All Force Strengthening Deviations have the ability to reach the pinnacle, but the amount of amplification they provide varies. ]\n[ Evolution Branches: These are the number of routes a Force Strengthening Deviation can take. Not all of the same type and sub-type are born equal. There are differences in strength between Spear Forces and even Light Elemental Forces. ]\nLeonel's brow furrowed. There was so much information. He didn't know if it was worth it to know all of it. After all, he only had three hours left. He had to make a decision. Sitting here listening to a history lesson on Force Strengthening Deviations would just be asking for death.\n\"Tell me about my Light Elemental Force specifically.\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ The Light Elemental Force Seed has comprehended comes from a Lineage Factor. This is somewhat different from a Force Strengthening Deviation comprehended naturally or awakened through and ability. ]\n[ A naturally comprehended Force Strengthening Deviation is limited by either one's comprehension or the source one has used to comprehend it. ]\nLeonel was confused by this for a moment, but after a while he understood. By 'source' the dictionary was referring to natural sources of Force Strengthening Deviations. For example, if one found a battle ground and there were many Spear Force scars along the ground, it would be possible to comprehend Spear Force from them. But, one would be limited by the expertise of the expert that carved the scars in the first place.\nOf course, one could also naturally comprehend Spear Force on their own much like Hutch comprehended Blade Force. In that case, it was on one's own shoulders to improve and evolve one's Spear Force.\n[ A Force Strengthening Deviation awakened through an ability would be limited by the Evolution Stage of one's ability. But, Seed's Force Strengthening Deviation is limited by the Lineage Factors of your Lineage Factor. ]\n[ The origin of Seed's Light Elemental Force is the Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor. ]\nLeonel's heart suddenly skipped a beat.\nTime dilated and he could feel that his breathing had slowed to a crawl. In that moment, his eyes became dim as though he had been trapped in an illusion.\nIn the beginning, all he saw was darkness. But, after a while, he could faintly see a small dot in the distance that radiated a bright light.\nHe blinked just a single time, but the moment his vision cleared, the light had completely covered the range he could see.\nThe sight was incomparably beautiful. A bird with eyes radiating with wisdom and feathers as white as snow looked down toward him. Its golden irises didn't have a hint of disdain or loftiness. Rather, it looked down as though a senior appreciating a junior. The gentleness touched Leonel's heart.\nCOOOOOOOOOOOCOOOOOOOOOOOOO\nA mighty call left the owl's beak as it flapped its wings once more, vanishing from Leonel's sight. But even still, the image continued to replay in his mind. And, as time began to regain its previous pace, Leonel's heart followed and quickened many times over.\nWhen Leonel's dull gaze regained its light, he found that his breathing had quickened and he was drenched from head to toe in sweat.\n'Wow…'\nSnowy Star Owl… What kind of creature was that? Leonel had no idea. But he somehow felt that it was incomparably majestic. Leonel wasn't sure how his Lineage Factor stacked up to other Light Elemental Lineage Factors, but what he did know was that this Lineage Factor made him feel extremely comfortable.\n[ The Snowy Star Owl is known especially for its speed, wisdom, and miracle healing. As such, Seed's Light Elemental Lineage Factor can be considered to have three main Branches of Evolution. ]\n[ The first branch is simply known as the Movement Evolution. Among Force Strengthening Deviation, Light Elemental Force only loses to Space Elemental Force in this regard. However, within the Speed sub-branch of the Movement Evolution Branch, the Light Element is unmatched. ]\n[ The second branch is known as the Support Evolution Branch. The Wisdom sub-branch and the Healing sub-branch both fall under this category. ]\n[ Both sub-branches can only be effectively used when combined with one's other Lineage Factors. Meaning one's level of Light Elemental Force can thus unlock Lineage Factor abilities and techniques to be used as one. ]\nWisdom? Healing?\nLeonel didn't know what these sub-branches were, but this Evolution Branch concept really reminded him the evolution trees of a role playing game. Was that how Lineage Factors worked as well?\nHe had thought that his Light Elemental Force had exceptionally good penetrative abilities, but judging by the words of the dictionary, this wasn't its main ability.\n\"Why do I feel that my Light Elemental Force had good penetrative ability?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, this is a result of Seed's Spear Domain Lineage Factor. ]\nLeonel furrowed his brows. \"Isn't my Spear Domain Lineage Factor much weaker than my Light Element Lineage Factor?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed: You're an idiot. ]\nHearing these words, not only did Leonel's face darken, but so did the other three youths who happened to be nearby him. Even in the situation, the sudden odd words almost made them burst into laughter.\nLeonel could tell that the 'You're an idiot' part was very lifelike. It seemed that it was yet another recording left by his father, but this time, it was just a short message.\n[ The strength of the Spear Domain Lineage Factor is in its ability to combine countless disciplines into one. This is why the Spear Domain Heirloom is filled with spears, each tied to a different consciousness and each with a completely different style. Only by combining many disciplines into one will the Spear Domain Lineage Factor truly show its might. ]\n[ The reason Seed's Light Elemental Force seems to have great penetrative abilities is because of the effect of Seed's Spear Domain Lineage Factor. It has integrated Seed's Light Elemental Force somewhat, giving it such an ability. ]\n[ Also, though attacking is not a main ability of the Snowy Star Owl, it is still an Elite Sixth Dimensional Mythical Beast. It would not be too weak in this regard. To lower Dimensions, its attack ability can be considered godly. ]\nAfter hearing all of this, Leonel finally understood. The penetrative ability of his Light Elemental Force occurred due to the influence of his Spear Domain Lineage Factor. But, since he had looked down on his Spear Domain Lineage Factor, he never actively tried to look into its secrets, thus inadvertently suppressing it.\n\"If that's the case…\"\nLeonel's blood rumbled, a spear appearing in his hand.\nWithout even getting up, his eyes flashed as he pierced forward. This time, he felt that the integration of his Spear Force and Light Elemental Force had risen by several degrees.\nPUUUUU\nLeonel's eyes glowed with a fierce light. \"Four meters!\"\nIt wasn't only him who was excited, but Flowing Wind practically pounced into his arms and gave him a kiss.\nThere really was hope.",

      "content": "After the initial bout of excitement, Leonel immediately calmed himself.\nWhat was there to be proud about? He had only touched four meters, there were still six more to go. And, it had now become even more obvious to him that the difficulty of crossing that distance doubled with every meter he passed. The fact he had directly jumped from two and a half meters to four was a testament to just how great his Spear Domain Lineage Factor was, but that was all. Was it even possible to improve enough to cross the remaining distance?\nThe other youths seemed to realize this as well. So, their smiling expressions soon faded.\n\"Handsome, hurry up and improve some more. I'm too young and beautiful to die.\" Flowing Wind said this as though joking around, but there was a well hidden fear in her tone. It wasn't something that Leonel would miss.\nLeonel took a deep breath.\n\"You three enter my spatial treasure. It should buy us more time.\"\nLeonel wasn't confident in the Segmented Cube's defensive ability. This wasn't because he was doubting its peak prowess, but rather because it was still in Phase One. In Phase One, it was essentially still limited to Third Dimensional Abilities. So, it was impossible for its abilities to be too grand.\nHowever, if these three youths entered the Segmented Cube and he placed it in his spatial bracelet, then he only needed to activate one Force Skin to protect them all. Like this, his less than four hour time limit would be over thirteen hours.\nThe three youths looked at each other and nodded.\nHere, they were only a burden to Leonel. It would be good if they could help in some way.\nLeonel sighed a breath of relief and took out the Segmented Cube.\nHe found that it was frenziedly absorbing the Force in the surroundings. At this pace, it might only be a few days before it could accumulate enough to evolve into Phase Two. But, Leonel obviously didn't have this long to wait.\nJust when Leonel was about to allow the youths in, he suddenly made a pleasant discovery.\n'The Segmented Cube can't leave this place, but it's still a natural Force barrier…'\nLeonel's eyes glowed with excitement. He hadn't put too much hope in the Segmented Cube. In fact, he had covered it with his Force Skin when he pulled it out just now. But, what he never expected was that it would actually be capable of forcefully absorbing any Force he gave it.\n'It can take volatile Force, absorb it, and make it docile!'\nIn that case, didn't that mean that Leonel's time limit wasn't limited to 13 or so hours anymore?!\nLeonel grinned as the three youths looked toward him in confusion.\n\"It seems we don't need to die here today.\"\nBefore the three could ask Leonel what he meant, the Segmented Cube expanded and enveloped the three of them.\nOn the outside, the Segmented Cube expanded to a ten meter diameter, hovering in the air above the Force Crystal Core.\nIt shuddered and trembled, bouncing back and forth between the two opposing edges of the Force geyser, but it eventually managed to reach an equilibrium.\nWithin the Abode Setting, the four youths watched on nervously as a violent earthquake took hold of the world within the Segmented Cube. They only managed to sigh a breath of relief after everything finally settled into a low rumble.\nLeonel wasn't any different from them. He too had been worried about the result, but luckily it had all paid off.\n\"There are a few rooms here. Feel free to pick one. There's also plenty of food and water. I'll definitely get us out of here.\"\nLeonel nodded to the youths. But when they saw the sadness on his expression, they couldn't help but be stunned.\nThis should have been a happy change of events. Why was it that Leonel didn't seem the slightest bit happy?\nLeonel turned to leave.\nFlowing Wind wanted to step out and stop him, maybe even try to cheer him up, but she found that two sturdy hands had landed on her shoulders, stopping her from moving forward.\nShe was completely stunned to find that both Roaring Black Lion and Thunderous Clap had tacitly agreed to stop her as one. She couldn't even react before Leonel had disappeared from her sight.\n\"Why the hell did you two stop me? He's our savior, shouldn't we at least say thank you? There's no reason for him to be feeling like that.\"\n\"You don't get it.\" Roaring Black Lion said with a snort. \"Even if things worked out in the end, his pride is still wounded.\"\n\"Pride?\" Flowing Wind's brows furrowed. Though it was blocked beneath her mask, one could imagine that it was quite a lovely sight to see.\n\"It's ultimately his fault that things turned out this way.\" Thunderous Clap spoke. \"There's even an argument to be made here that we're only alive by a fluke. Even stumbling into the ability of this abode type treasure was a mistake.\"\n\"What the hell are you saying? We made our own choice to come here with him. Plus, he was in just as much danger as us. Only a bastard would blame him for information we all lacked equally.\"\n\"You still don't get it. I don't know what's weighing on Indom… Leonel's mind, but whatever it is, he definitely feels like his performance makes him unworthy of meeting those goals.\n\"He takes himself to be responsible for our lives. Whether it was coming to this hive or accelerating the maturity of the Force Crystal Core, they were all his ideas. But, he's seemingly made one mistake after another.\n\"For a man like him, he definitely feels inadequate.\"\nFlowing WInd snorted. \"If it was just garbage male pride, you should have just said so from the beginning. But he's so handsome and caring at the same time, this lady definitely likes him.\"\nRoaring Black Lion and Thunderous Clap looked at one another helplessly. This Flowing Wind girl was definitely too far gone.",

      "content": "Leonel sat on a chair in the Lab Setting, staring out blankly into space.\nIn truth, in the beginning, even he wasn't fully aware of why he was feeling like this. It could even be said that Thunderous Clap and Roaring Black LIon understood before even he had. It could only be said that the objectivity of a third party was great.\nHe had come here with every intention of instantly getting to work, diving into training until he could barge his way out. But, instead of doing any of that, he found himself frozen in time.\nAfter a long while, he finally understood the emotion he was feeling…\nShame.\nHe had made too many mistakes. Initially, he kept brushing them off as though they were nothing more than jokes. But it seemed that as time passed, the 'mistakes' he made continued to have more and more serious consequences. It came to the point where even though this most recent mistake of his had no real consequences yet, he simply couldn't put up with himself anymore.\nWhat truly baffled him was that he wasn't immediately certain of how to fix this. Wasn't it only natural that someone as young and uninformed as him make so many mistakes?\nBut, the more Leonel thought about it, the more he felt that this excuse was exactly that… an excuse. In a world like this, who cared if he needed time to mature? Would the spider king's venom wait for him? Would the Force Crystal Core let him go on account of his youth? Would Simeon leave him be until he matured?\nThe answer to all of this was obviously no. No one owed him such a thing.\nCompared to others, how much better was his starting position? Whether it was his talent, the treasures his father left for him, or the Lineage Factor his mother left for him… How many times luckier was he than another?\nTo this day, he still had no idea how well his teammates were doing. Did James fall out with them after being snubbed by him? What about Yuri? She was one of Aina's only two friends. How was she doing with them? Was she okay?\nCompared to these people, wasn't he considered to be lucky?Was this what those psychologists deemed as survivor's guilt?\nMaybe that was exactly what it was. Leonel felt undeserving. He made so many life altering mistakes, yet managed to survive every time by the skin of his teeth. Sometimes it might be due to his own wit, but how many more times had it just been luck?\nMemories were constantly pulled up from the depths of Leonel's mind, each one striking a cord with him.\nWhen he first exited the Mayan Tomb and Aina killed Conrad with a single strike. During their journey to the Fort, he had even had thoughts of being unwilling to live anymore.\nHow ridiculous had his actions been back then? He even went out and fought seven A-grade Invalids back to back. Maybe that had been under the guise of protecting his friends, but wasn't the truth that he was just seeking death?\nHow lucky had he been to survive that? Did he even deserve to survive that? His abilities back then couldn't even compare to the current him. A single A-grade threat was more than enough to threaten his life…\nThen there was the time within the Joan of Arc Zone. Due to his own selfishness, he forced both him and Aina into a corner. Instead of waiting until both armies had whittled their strength down, he stupidly charged in.\nBack then, without a word, Aina had still chosen to follow him. But, had he not found Joan's weakness at the last minute, wouldn't they have both died?\nHow lucky had he been to survive that? How could he eve think of blaming Aina for lying to him about the entry quota when he, himself, was so selfish?\nThen there was the battle at the Royal Blue Fort. He had foolishly traveled back to the Fort, thinking that everything would be over as long as he made his way back. But, that ended up in Aina almost dying, and now she was in a world he knew next to nothing about. Who knew what kind of hardships she was undergoing now?\nHow lucky had he been to survive that? If he hadn't been so naive, wouldn't Aina still be by his side right now?\nLeonel continued to blankly stare at the wall, his heart beat slowing to eerie speeds.\nWhat a joke. Even with Aina by his side right now, would he even be capable of protecting her?\nHere he was again. Another stupid mistake. He was suffering here because of his own foolishness, his own naiveté.\nHow lucky had he been to survive this?\nHe could have avoided it. Had he just been more cautious, had he just asked more questions, had he just not gotten ahead of himself...\nThis all ultimately stemmed from his own personality. Nothing ever entered his sights, nothing ever caught his attention. The only exception to this was Aina, and other than knowing that he appreciated her demeanor, Leonel couldn't quite explain his infatuation either. He only knew it existed.\nBut, what right did he have to have such a disposition if those things he always put beneath his notice always became roadblocks he could only rely on luck to surpass? What right did he have to be arrogant?\nHis father always said the two most important things in life were Respect and Persistence. But had he ever truly engraved these words into his heart? Or had he only ever taken them perfunctorily?\nHow could he claim to have Respect and Persistence in all things if he was constantly placing himself above everything?\nLeonel suddenly thought of the kind eyes of the Snowy Star Owl. Such a beautiful majestic creature. To it.. He was nothing more than an ant. Yet, it looked toward him with such fondness and love.\n'Never again.'\nLeonel's heart thrummed.\nHe didn't mean that he would never make a mistake again. If he dared to think such a thing, wouldn't he have learned nothing? This would just be the same conceit packaged in a different way.\nRather, he was acknowledging that his character needed to be tempered. This feeling of shame… he didn't want to feel it again.\nWENG!\nA bright golden glow shot from Leonel's eyes. He inadvertently sunk into a state of contemplation. He was so lost in his own thoughts that he didn't even notice his Spirit improving by leaps and bounds…",

      "content": "Within Leonel's Ethereal Glabella, a striking change was occurring.\nIn the beginning, it had been a world of white fog. It could be said that the only tangible existences within it were the two white stars hanging in the air. However, now, everything began to slowly change.\nAfter comprehending Spear Force and Light Elemental Force, two new objects appeared in Leonel's Ethereal Glabella. The first was a 12 sided star. It was very small, barely being about a foot in diameter, but it glowed with a resplendent light. The second was a transparent Spear Soul. It had a fuzzy body one had to squint to make out and its blade seemed very dull. But, it still gave off a bit of the sharpness one would expect from a spear.\nAt that moment, however, a violent trembling took hold of the world.\nFirst, the 12 sided star began to vibrate. With each tremor, it grew a fold in size.\nAfter several moments, its size even dwarfed the round white stars in the sky to the point that they even began to orbit about it.\nWENG! WENG! WENG!\nThe moment that transformation was complete, the white fog of the realm began to recede. No, it was inaccurate to say that it was receding and far better to say that it was being compressed.\nThe more the fog was compressed, the less white it seemed and the more golden it became. It wasn't just the white fog itself, but even the Stars of the [Dimensional Cleanse] technique seemed to be gaining tinges of gold along their fiery surfaces.\n[Spirit: 2.32]\n…\n[Spirit: 3.00]\n…\n[Spirit: 3.89]\n…\n[Spirit: 5.23]\n…\nLeonel's spirit didn't stop growing until it rammed up against the 6.00 barrier, stopping just shy of it at 5.98.\nOne had to remember that Leonel's stats had always been arbitrary. For example, he always set his Force stat at 0.10 per Force Node he had, then stat'd out everyone else accordingly. His physical stats were somewhat less arbitrary, but still only based on estimations. However, his spirit stat was just like his Force stat and completely based on his own prowess.\nAs a result of this, a number like 5.98 was hard to put into perspective. However, due to his sudden awakening, Leonel had gained memories that seemed to both have always been his, yet were somehow new at the same time.\nThanks to this, he came to understand something.\nSpirit between 0.01 and 3.00 could be considered to be within the Fourth Dimensional Realms. Having just 0.01 and even 0.001 was enough to represent the awakening of Internal Sight. Anyone who could do this was able to cultivate a Force Node creation technique.\nSo what did this mean? Spirit between 3.01 and 6.00 could be considered to be within the Fifth Dimension!\nThe numbers weren't pretty since Leonel had formulated the system on his own. But this was already enough to shock one completely.\nLeonel still couldn't be considered to have formed a Fourth Dimensional Body yet. He would need to perfect the part of [Dimensional Cleanse] he had first before he could do that.\nYet, despite this, his spirit had already crossed into the Fifth Dimension and even seemed a hair's breadth from the Sixth. It was simply inconceivable.\nSpirit wasn't like physical stats. Those kind of stats would need a massive increase before undergoing a qualitative change. But, Spirit was so hard to gain in the first place. Leonel had never even met a person aside from himself that was even close to the 1.00 barrier, let alone approaching the 6.00 barrier like him.\nThe difference was too striking!\nLeonel's eyes flashed open, a beam shooting out from within them against his will. It was a long while before his eyes dimmed from a bright green back down to its usual pale ivory color.\nA slow breath left his lips.\nHis mind felt so fresh and clear, yet he didn't have the self satisfied attitude one would expect. He knew well that this improvement was all in thanks to a Lineage Factor he didn't earn himself. What use was there in being proud?\nHe had made such a big show of wanting to 'comprehend' his Lineage Factors on his own, but hadn't he relied on his talent in the end anyway?\nBut the current Leonel wasn't the same Leonel of the past. He wouldn't allow such things to hold him back.\nHe wouldn't completely rely on his talent, but there was no need to directly ignore it either. There was no need for him to be hypocrite, on one hand ignoring the god given gifts he had been handed, and on the other, still relying on them to escape dangerous situations by a hair. He didn't want to be that kind of person.\n\"What stage is my ability at now?\" Leonel asked.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Evolution Stage: Elite Tier 9 Bronze ]\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath. It seemed his conjecture was correct. His ability and his spirit work in a feedback loop. If he could use [Dimensional Cleanse] to nurture his ability and by extension raise his spirit, then raising his spirit should by extension increase his ability's cap.\nLeonel's aura blossomed with confidence. However, this wasn't a confidence borne of arrogance, but rather a confidence borne of ability — a striking difference to the version of himself just a day ago.\nLeonel looked toward his injured left hand. He had just unlocked the first Wisdom Branch of his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor. It was known as Northern Twelve Stars according to the memories that had appeared in his mind.\nIf he wanted a chance to heal his left hand quickly, he would need to awaken the first Healing Branch. However, after a moment of thought, he directly decided against this.\nHis mind seemed to be working on a different gear entirely. He immediately thought of several possible solutions and disregarded all but the best.\n\"Of the Pseudo and True Fourth Dimensional plants I collected earlier, list all those that have healing properties and tell me about all of their effects.\"\n[ *Ping* ]",

      "content": "At that moment, within the Southern Lookout, Old Hutch could actually be found within his office. Or, more accurately, the office he had snatched from the previous Supreme.\nThough he was here, it seemed he was only so physically. By the way he put his wrinkled feet up and was snoring away with a box of pizza sliding around his chest, he most deifinitely wasn't here mentally.\nBANG!\nAt that moment, a young lady slammed her small palm on the table, causing it to directly split in two. She couldn't have been more than 16 or 17 years old, but she didn't give Old Hutch the slightest bit of face as she startled him awake.\n\"Damn perverted old man. You called us here for something urgent yet you're sleeping without a care in the world?!\"\nTo the young lady's side, there was a quiet young man who was seemingly used to all of this. He kicked at one of the falling wooden pieces of the once whole desk, just barely allowing it to catch a piece of falling pizza before it stained the expensive carpets.\nOld Hutch and the young lady looked toward the young man.\n\"Clean freak.\"\nThey snapped as one, causing the young man to roll his eyes.\n\"Why did you call us here old man?\" The young man asked.\n\"Oh… Why did I call you here? I forget…\"\nOld Hutch smacked his lips. Who knows what he was dreaming about for his eyes to be so misty.\n\"Damn old pervert…\" The young woman spit out through gritted teeth.\n\"Ah, that's right. There's a Force Eruption on the B Sector Project Hunt Island. Go help them out.\"\nThe brows of the two youths furrowed.\n\"Just the two of us? Are you crazy?\" The young woman snapped.\n\"What? Aren't you supposed to be geniuses?\"\n\"Don't joke around, old man.\" The young man's frown deepened. \"We're supposed to be getting ready for the SS-grade Zone. If we get injured in a beast tide, how will we go?\"\n\"I'm sure we've got plenty of Healing Type ability users in this place.\" Old Hutch said lazily.\nJudging by the look of the young man and woman, they wanted nothing more than to tear Old Hutch apart. But, they knew they weren't a match for this old man. Causing him to lose a small bit of face every so often was the best they could do.\n\"Fine, fine. Things aren't so simple as they seem. I received an intelligence report a while ago that the Brazinger Clan is involved.\"\n\"Weeks ago? And you still let those kids go?\"\nThis time, it was the young man and Old Hutch's turn to look at the young lady weirdly. Her 18th birthday was still a couple months away. Many of those 'kids' she was talking about were older than she was.\nThe young lady, though, didn't seem to notice their weird gazes and kept glaring at Old Hutch.\n\"They needed to be tempered a bit.\" Old Hutch said with a yawn. \"Plus, I thought it would be a while more until the Force Eruption occurred. Those Brazinger family brats probably got caught off guard as well or else they wouldn't have come either.\"\n\"Fine, fine. But that still doesn't explain why you're only sending the two of us.\"\n\"Those hidden families like to find excuses to bend the rules all the time. If I send someone better, they'll move in under the guise of 'protecting' their young brats then directly take whatever it is they want. This Force Crystal Mine is too good to give to them.\"\nSeeing that the two were still frowning, Old Hutch got up and patted their shoulders with a grin on his face.\n\"You two don't have much of a choice.\"\nThe expressions of the two darkened.\n\"While you're out there, look out for a brat who goes by Leonel. You three should probably work together to get out of there. Off you go.\"\nThe two youths looked at each other.\nThat Project Hunt Island was one of the weaker ones. It could only be considered somewhat special due to the fact it had a Force Crystal Mine. But since the Slayer Legion was waiting for it to mature, they still hadn't touched it.\nAs for them, they obviously went to Project Hunt Islands with greater challenges. They felt no need to waste time on this island.\nBut, this said, they weren't blindly arrogant. If they were, why would they feel so apprehensive about going to an island with an ongoing Force Eruption? They knew exactly how dangerous such a thing would be. If they blindly went, they'd be asking for death.\nOf course, this didn't mean they weren't confident. They both believed that if they were cautious, no harm would come to them. It was just that it would be impossible to save the 80 or so youths that went with just the two of them alone.\nThis was all to say that they were a bit baffled that Old Hutch would be talking about this 'Leonel' as though he was their equal. If he was, wouldn't he be rubbing elbows with them? Why would he be over there?\n\"Don't underestimate that kid, he's quite arrogant and awakened Light Elemental Force.\"\nThe two youths finally raised an eyebrow in curiosity. Light Elemental Force? That was exceptionally rare. At least, there was no one in their Slayer Legion with such an ability. From what they knew, there was only that person currently in the Capital with it…\n\"Either way, you'll be entering the SS-grade Zone with that brat soon. So, you might as well get used to teaming up.\"\nThis time, Old Hutch didn't play any games. If this was just a normal encounter, he might have tricked these two into hating Leonel first. But at a time like this, even he couldn't be careless. It would really be a pity if those youths all died.\nBut, there was something even more important to grasp from this… Old Hutch was still willing to risk these lives just so that the Brazinger Clan wouldn't have an excuse to claim the Force Crystal Mine…\n**\n\"Young Lord, we've completely lost track of Jian and Quinn. Should we check the tunnels they were assigned?\"\nSimeon's brow furrowed deeply.\nIf they wasted time doing this, they would lose at least a few more days. But, what if they didn't and the reason the two disappeared or died was as a result of encountering the Force Eruption? In that case, wouldn't they be missing out?\nJust when Simeon was about to make a decision, another group suddenly converged on them. Of course, they were also part of the Brazinger family.\n\"Young Lord, we have good news.\"\nA man with red hair and eyes, similar to the rest of them, stepped forward with a happy expression.\n\"You found the Force Crystal Mine?\" Simeon's eyes brightened, already forgetting about the disappearance of his two subordinates. Who cared if they died if the mine was found?\n\"We can't be certain, but we have found something good.\" The man quickly explained, not willing to allow Simeon to become disappointed. \"We found a passage out of the hive.\"\nSimeon frowned. He had already felt unhappy when the answer was no, now this fool was telling him about a passage out of the hive? There were hundreds of those. If it wasn't for this, how would they have so many tunnels to explore?\n\"No, no, no. Sorry Young Lord, I'm a fool who's terrible with words. What I mean is that this passage out of the hive leads to the valleys. We stepped out and found that the Force Concentration was many times higher there. It's possible that there's a more direct path to the mine through the valleys.\"\nIt was only after hearing this that Simeon's expression brightened once more. They had tried many ways to descend the valleys, but they all ended in failure. A few of his subordinates had even died in the attempt. If there was another path, this was perfect.\nThe likelihood that there was a direct path to mine through the valleys was exceptionally high, especially since it was theorized that the valleys themselves were caused by the mine to begin with!\n\"Excellent! Lead the way.\"",

      "content": "Leonel looked at his left hand, flexing it slowly and testing each of his fingers one by one.\n'It's a little weaker than it has been in the past. It will probably take me a few weeks to recover completely back to the Advanced Grade One Designation. For now, I'll have to do with Grade One Designation.'\nThere had been plants among the few Leonel took out that could return him back to the Advanced Grade One Designation immediately, but they all had lingering side effects. The only way to perfectly recover so quickly — in the case of such low level herbs, anyway — was by drawing on his life force. But, this was a path with many lingering problems.\nThe herb Leonel chose was actually a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional healing type herb known as Three-Vein Mending Weed. It was quite a common healing herb and was perfect for a body still within the Third Dimension like Leonel's. If he wanted to heal the same injury while he had a Fourth Dimensional body, it would take a much stronger herb like Four-Vein Mending Weed.\nInstead of overdrawing his life force, Mending Weed used its Natural Force Art to nurture flesh wounds and supplement their healing. These Natural Force Arts were drawn directly from the 'veins' that were within their namesake.\nTheir healing abilities were less exaggerated, but due to their way of doing things, the lingering issues were much more acceptable.\n'I have to be careful.' Leonel thought seriously.\nWounds like his could have easily crippled him for life. Without godly medicine, one's path to grow stronger could easily be completely impeded by a single severe injury.\nLuckily, the Leonel of now felt that he was far steadier than he had been in the past. Though it couldn't be said that he had completely changed, he at least felt that he was on the right path now. He hopefully wouldn't make such rash decisions again.\n'I still can't believe it took me two days to complete a Dream Sculpt of the Three-Vein Mending Weed…'\nWhen Leonel learned the secrets of the Mending Weed, he had been very interested in its Natural Force Arts. But, he could have never expected that even with the evolution of his ability and the fact his spirit had entered the peak of the Fifth Dimension that it would still take him so long to perfectly copy it.\nOne had to remember that it only took him about a day to Dream Sculpt Joan's flag pole. That treasure could only be counted as being within the Third Dimension but Leonel's spirit was just at the beginning stages of the Fourth Dimension back then.\nBut now, his soul was in the Fifth Dimension and this Three-Vein Mending Weed was in the Third, but it still took him two days!\nThis experience taught Leonel something very important… Natural Force Arts were not a joke. If he really thought it would be so simple to speed up the maturation of the Force Crystal Core… he was sorely mistaken.\nToward such a conclusion, Leonel could only smile bitterly. Just how naive had he been?\nHe struggled so much to etch a Third Dimensional Natural Force Art into his memories, but the Force Crystal Core was now trying to complete a Fourth Dimensional Natural Force Art. How could these things even be compared?\n'I need more strength.'\nLeonel no longer felt the need to rush. He would go at his own pace. Rushing everything and being headstrong was how he constantly got into trouble.\nHe knew that the little mink would wake up just one more day and a bit. He also knew that it was very likely Simeon might find the Force Crystal Mine any time now. But, if he was always rashly doing things, wouldn't he just be rushing himself to death?\nOnly by being steady in his every step and earning his conceit and arrogance would he be able to safely weather this storm.\nEven though this was Leonel's new mindstate, he wouldn't just waste two days as he had just done without reason. Everything needed to be done in moderation.\nThe reason he saw fit to waste these two days was precisely so that he could have a better understanding of what he was facing. Now, he was aware of just how domineering Natural Force Arts were. By his estimation, compared to Force Arts created by humans, they were a Dimensional Tier higher.\nIn that case, Leonel knew that what he needed to do now was grow more powerful.\n'So what should I do? Form my Force Nodes? Or comprehend my Metal Synergy Lineage Factor?'\nAfter a moment of calculation, Leonel landed on the second option. His thoughts now were incomparably quick. Compared to before, he could complete the same train of thought that might have taken him an hour before in just a few moments.\nLeonel sunk into a state of contemplation. Compared to the past, his ability to see through his Lineage Factors with the help of his Soul Force was several levels more potent. It wasn't long before he sensed the last dormant Lineage Factor within his blood.\nBefore, it was only a vague feeling he had to meditate on for several days. But now, he could practically see their visualizations. It looked like several shackles binding tightly to his blood vessels.\nLeonel could see it all, as though several small and intricate Natural Force Arts were floating around his body. He could easily follow them all, it was as though he had shrunk and entered his body, following the paths his blood flowed through.\nLeonel got lost in the feeling. He had almost completely forgotten that he was here to unlock these shackles, not observe them. But, his body felt like a universe unto itself. Its depth and complexity seemed to be no less… it was mesmerizing.\nBefore Leonel realized what was happening, he had followed his blood into his kidneys, passively observing as the crimson liquid went through a cycle of purification. No, it couldn't be said to be crimson, his blood seemed to carry a tinge of holiness from his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor…\nThe cycle of purification left Leonel in another daze. The human body really was a beautiful thing. Everything worked together like a well oiled machine.\nSuddenly, Leonel startled awake as though his mind had been struck my lightning.\n'My kidneys!'\nLeonel understood why he had never been able to find his Ninth Node. It was because his 'ninth' was actually his Ninth and Tenth!",

      "content": "Leonel's breathing quickened slightly. He was absolutely certain. If he managed to form a Ninth and Tenth Node, one for each of his kidneys, the compatibility with his body would reach 100%. Not only that, but the benefits would be immeasurable.\nIf he formed Force Nodes in his brain, spine, heart, lungs and kidneys, his control over his body would reach an unprecedented degree. Not only that, but if he controlled the purification process of his blood through his Force, wouldn't his ability to comprehend his Lineage Factors become that much more potent?\nAfter a while, Leonel calmed himself.\nThe difficulty of forming a Tenth Node was an unknown entity to Leonel. He still knew too little. He didn't even know if such a thing was possible.\nAll he did know was that there was a limit to the number of Force Nodes a body could contain. Nine was the theoretical limit.\nAt the same time, though, was this really an infallible rule? Wasn't the limit of Force Nodes decided due to how much Force one could handle? But didn't some people have larger Force Nodes in comparison to others? In that case, were all Force Nodes really created equal?\nLeonel's Force Nodes were constructed with 100 cells. Most people could only form Force Nodes with one or a couple cells at most. In that case, didn't Leonel form their equivalent of dozens of Force Nodes?\nIn the end, Leonel shook his head. Even though this seemed like sound logic on the surface, he wouldn't act on it just yet. He would definitely hound the dictionary with more questions, but now wasn't the time.\nIt would take time to research whether his plan was feasible. But unlocking his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor… could be done now!\nWENG!\nLeonel's aura suddenly became incomparably heavy. Even the chair beneath him snapped and crumbled, causing him to fall heavily to the ground. But, he was so focused in his state of meditation that he didn't even notice.\nHis dirty blond hair began to whip about wildly, flashing with a bright bronze color before dimming once more, only to shimmer with it once again.\nLeonel could see it clearly. The opening of his Metal Synergy Bloodline, compared to his Snowy Star Owl and Spear Domain Lineage Factors, was much more involved.\nHe could see it before him now. Within his blood, there were five massive gates. However, compared to the first, the next four were too far away. Leonel could tell that no matter how hard he tried, he would never be able to reach those gates, at least not with his current strength.\nRealizing this, he focused completely on the gate right before him. It was a massive bronze door, covered in shackles that wrapped around it endlessly.\nThis singular door was built with several levels. Like a nesting doll, the smallest door was surrounded by larger and larger doors. There were nine in total, with the largest door amongst them looming so tall that even when Leonel craned his neck vertically, he couldn't see its peak.\nLeonel took a step forward. He felt that with every step he took , a greater and greater pressure weighed on him. It was as though this door was doing everything in its power to force him to his knees.\nLeonel smiled lightly. If it was just a few days ago, his spirit would have directly been blasted out of this place. By then, he would have no choice but to wait for his Lineage Factor to be awakened naturally. But now, this pressure was still within his ability to withstand.\nSoon, Leonel's palms were pressed against the doors. Due to his stature compared to the massive doors, he could only touch the smallest.\nWhen he pushed, he felt that he could easily open the first, even with its chains on. But, he found that the second nested door hardly budged. It was only after he put in some effort that even the third nested door showed signs of movement.\n'So the harder I push, the more likely it is for the larger doors to budge, huh…?'\nLeonel had no idea that in the outside world, the colors he was radiating were wildly changing.\nWhen he barely opened the first door, his hair radiated a dull bronze color that almost looked like dirty copper.\nWhen he pushed hard enough for a reaction to occur in the second door, this muddied bronze became clearer.\nBy the time he elicited a response in the third door, his hair shone like polished brass. It almost felt as though the fine filaments of his hair were no different than refined metal.\n'Interesting…' Leonel thought, looking up toward the highest ninth door. 'Well since I'm here, I might as well try my best, right…?'\nAt that moment, a mighty aura radiated out from Leonel body. Even the Segmented Cube began to vibrate wildly. Compared to the past, this aura of his seemed several times more indomitable. It seemed that tempering his character had had other effects as well.\nA mighty roar left Leonel's lips as he pushed.\nWhat Leonel didn't know was that while he was straining with his utmost, in a world countless light years across the universe, violent changes were taking place as well.\nThis was the family home of the Morales family. In fact, it was more accurate to call it a family planet as the entire stretch of space was owned by them and them alone.\nAt that moment, changes were occurring in their Ceremonial Room.\nThis sacred place was incomparably vast. In fact, if one had the mind to pay attention, though this place was located within the main estate of the Mortal family, it was somehow larger than even the planet they called home!\nIn the distance, sticks of incense stood taller than even mountains, wafting out a refreshing scent that filled the land with a thin veil of fog. At the base of where these mountainous stick of incense stood, there was an alter that carried several sacred tablets.\nThose who knew the teachings of the Morales family were aware that each of these tablets carried the names of a generation of Morales family descendants. And, at that time, the tablet of the current generation, known as the Nova Generation by the family elders, suddenly radiated out a blinding light.\nAt that moment, the several family higher ups who treated this place as a cultivation holy land suddenly snapped awake.\nWhat was going on? A Lineage Factor awakening? But everyone of the Nova Generation had already awoken…",

      "content": "The elders of the Morales family were left speechless. But, they all suddenly thought of a possiblity.\nTheir gazes met across hundreds of miles. It seemed that even though each was kneeling on a prayer mat all to their own, without a single sign of life even tens of miles around them, it was as though they were right next to each other.\nA double awakening!\nTheir Morales family was split into two factions. But, the history between these two halves of the family was long and tumultuous.\nIn the past, the Morales family also had two halves. However, back then, what divided them was the awakening of the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor. The awakening of this bloodline split the family into elites and commoners. Those who awakened it could enter the main branch, while those who failed could only lead the sub branches of the family.\nHowever, this status quo didn't remain like this. Many generations ago, a second Lineage Factor was birthed within their bloodline. This created not one main branch, but two main branches of the family!\nBack then, this had been completely astonishing. The rarity of a Dual Lineage Factor Clan was unimaginable. And, it was precisely this awakening that allowed the Morales Clan to surge up from the middle ranges of the Seventh Dimension to the absolute peak.\nStill, though the Morales family faced the world as one, there were inevitably disputes between the two factions. The complexities and intricacies of these disputes didn't need to be touched upon for now, but what was important to understand was the difficulty in awakening these two bloodlines.\nThe Spear Domain Lineage Factor was the weakest upon awakening. Though it had great potential for growth, it could also very easily remain weak to the point where even some Sixth and even Fifth Dimensional Lineage Factors could suppress it.\nAs a result of this, there were comparatively more who touched upon the Spear Domain Lineage Factor and their starting points were all the same. There was no distinguishing these bloodlines until they were given adequate time to grow, only then would it be possible to understand whose was stronger.\nBut, the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor was different. Not only was it far more difficult to awaken, it had a far more robust hierarchy system attached to it.\nOne can imagine how this might cause problems. On the one hand, the Spear Domain Lineage Factor had amazing growth potential and a high population of evolvers within the Morales Clan. On the other, the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor was much rarer and comparatively more powerful at the outset.\nThose who initially grasped the Spear Domain Lineage Factor were branch family members who were disatisfied with their position beneath the main branch. While many of the Metal Synergy branch were purists of the family. After all, much of the accomplishments of the Morales family was in thanks to this Lineage Factor!\nWith a family suffering such inner strife, the best way to continue to maintain the balance was to have many young leaders who carried both Lineage Factors. Only that way could animosities of the past be slowly ebbed away and the family could be forged into a solid steel plate.\nKnowing this, it was no wonder the elders were so excited. They would have another double awakened youth from the Nova Generation! They had already far surpassed the number from the last generation, but who knew they would still receive another?!\nTo put this into perspective, the last generation, the Nebula Generation, only had three such characters. But, if this newly awakened youth was added, the Nova Generation would have eight!\nOne had to know that the greatest power of the Spear Domain Lineage Factor was its ability to aggregate the abilities of its host to form the greatest spear heritage. This meant that anyone who awakened both within the Morales Clan was already predestined to be an elite amongst elites! The Metal Synergy Lineage Factor was that powerful!\nThe elders excitedly made their way to the altar one after another. But, despite their excitement, they didn't lose their sense of propriety. This was a sacred land, they had to maintain due composure and respect.\nOne after another, they performed their bows and kowtows, reverently praising their Ancestors before closing in on the altar one by one.\n\"Our Morales Clan is truly blessed.\" A crooked-toothed elder grinned wildly, hardly able to hold back his happiness. \"What do you old fogies think, you think this one will open the ninth door as well?\"\nThe elders stroked their beards in happiness, not even minding the crooked-toothed elder's comments. If they were old fogies, wasn't he doubly and even triply so? Just look at that ugly yellow grin. He really lost face for all Seventh Dimensional entities.\n\"It really does seem that all the stars are aligning. In the Nebula Generation, only one opened the ninth door on their first try. The others could only open it on a second attempt before moving on to the Fifth Dimension. Yet we have seven such youngsters already.\"\nThe elders laughed heartily. Their expressions were filled with familial warmth. Though the tablet was burning too brightly to see which name it was that was causing the change, to them, it didn't matter who it was. Weren't they all part of their Morales family?\n\"Hoho, those are the clear bronze lights of the third door already. Let's see how far this brat goes…\"\n…\nAt this moment, Leonel had no idea that his actions were being watched. Though it wasn't exactly like that and they could only be said to be able to see which door he was attacking, he could never imagine that someone else could monitor what he was doing from countless light years away. The means of the Seventh Dimension were far beyond his comprehension…\nHowever, even if he did know, he wasn't in a state to mind. His heart was as still as a lake, his mind as focused as the pierce of a spear.\n\"HA!\"\nHe roared in his mind as the fourth door began to move.\nFlickering bronze patterns began to squirm across his forehead. If one looked closely, it would almost look like Leonel had tattooed a resplendent brass crown onto his head…",

      "content": "\"The fourth door.\"\nThe elders smiled brilliantly. This speed and momentum was excellent.\nThere was a reason the longer one remained awake, the greater potential their Lineage Factor would have. However, this wasn't a universal truth. At least for more complex bloodlines like this one, there were qualitative changes to look for.\nWho cared if Leonel spent several days in this state if he only opened up to the second door? Likewise, who cared if he only needed several minutes if he could open the ninth?\nIt could be said that the higher the grade of the Lineage Factor, the more unique quirks it would have and the less likely it would be to conform to the norm. The Metal Synergy Lineage Factor was exactly like this!\nThe lights radiating from the Nova Generation's stone tablet began to wiggle with complex runes. Soon, these runes formed a crown not much unlike the crown etched onto Leonel's forehead. It radiated a gorgeous and pure bronze color, the kind that could only be gained after polishing a metal again and again and again.\n…\nWENG!\nLeonel's body quaked as even the floor of the Lab Setting cracked beneath his might. Phase One was simply too fragile. Just the aura of his Lineage Factor alone was enough to cause it to tremble.\nLuckily, its self healing properties kicked in. With such a large store of Force around it thanks to the Force Crystal Mine, how could it not repair itself quickly?\nBronze runes began to spread down Leonel's back. They were boxy and straight forward in nature, being carved of straight lines and sharp corners. If one looked closely, it was possible to notice that they followed the pattern of Leonel's Force Nodes, only appearing where they appeared as though drawing a map of his inner body on his skin.\n…\nThe elders were astonished.\n\"This little brat only formed Six Nodes? Which elder is guiding him?\" A ferocious elder's beard whipped about beneath his fierce breath. One could almost mistake him for a bull. \"Who allowed such a talent to ruin himself like this?!\"\nMany of the other elders frowned as well. They didn't reprimand the bullish elder for reacting like this at all despite this being a sacred land.\nWhich of them didn't know that it was best to awaken one's Metal Synergy Lineage Factor after perfecting one's Fourth Dimensional Foundation? All of the other seven youths had formed Nine Nodes, suppressing the talent of their Lineage Factor until they could explode forth with all their momentum. Doing so with less would put much more pressure on oneself.\nNow, all of them could clearly see the patterns stretching down from the crown. With their insight, how could they not tell that Leonel only had Six Nodes?\n\"At least the foundation of those Six Nodes is at the peak. With the size of those patterns, this brat definitely used at least 80 cells to form his Nodes…\"\nThe other elders nodded, but this only made them feel that it was even more of a pity. If they found the elder that was leading this brat, they'd definitely beat the former until he cried blood. Who would take responsibility for ruining such a genius?\n\"The sixth!\"\nThe crooked-toothed elder called out.\n…\nThe sharp patterns bloomed across Leonel's body. This time, it no longer remained on his back and instead spread out across his limbs and chest, covering his body in a resplendent bronze that was almost difficult to look directly at.\nEven sitting, he looked like a Roman God carved of the most exquisite brass. The energy he wafted alone seemed to make the air around him countless times heavier.\nLeonel breathed heavily, his breath coming out so hot that it left billowing white steam in the air. It was just the sixth door, but it was already so difficult. It also had to be said that he had only opened it a sliver, who knew how much strength it would take to open it all the way.\nEvery time a pattern was drawn onto his body, it felt as though he was lifting a heavier and heavier weight. With each passing moment, his muscles would snap under the tension. If it wasn't for the resplendent light shrouding his body, it would be possible to see ghastly bruises spreading beneath his skin.\nLeonel's 'hands' were still pressed against the first door, but his strength had influenced the sixth. The seventh and beyond were still looming over him as though taunting him without restraint.\nA deep rooted resolution caused Leonel's heart to quake. He roared with all his might, taking a step forward.\nBANG!\nThe seventh door shuddered, its shackles rattling wildly. The sound of its chains banging about resounded in Leonel's mind, making him feel as though a piercing headache would tear his soul apart.\nWENG! WENG! WENG!\nLeonel's body finally couldn't bear the pressure. His skin splintered and cracked, raining down a torrent of blood that seemed to fuse with the bronze light around his body. The eerie crimson gave him a devilish air, especially as his hair whipped about wildly.\nAt that point, even the Abode Setting wasn't left unscathed. Roaring Black Lion, Flowing Wind and Thunderous Clap could only look at one another with apprehension in their eyes. Could it be that this abode treasure couldn't withstand the Force Crystal Core any longer?\nWithin his Bloodline World, Leonel stood leaning against the first doors, his head hung low. His hair covered his features completely, giving him the disheveled appearance of someone at the end of their rope.\nHis breathing came out ragged and unharmonious. It seemed that he really might not be able to take a single step more.\n…\nThe expressions of the elder's dimmed. They all felt that it was a pity in their hearts as they watched the patterned lights surrounding the tablet wavering. Had this brat of the Nova Generation been just a bit more patient, it wouldn't have been a problem to open all nine doors on the first try.\nTheir Lineage Factor was special. The difficulty of entering their Bloodline World would become progressively more difficult with each entry. Likewise, the opening of their Lineage Factor Shackles would also increase in difficulty. This was why it was so important to open as many as one could on the first try.\nBut, some bastard had ruined the future of this prodigy, how could they not lament it in their hearts?",

      "content": "Leonel breathed heavily, his hands still firmly placed on the first door.\nWas this his limit?\nThe truth was he didn't know the significance of his accomplishment. Something like opening seven doors on the first attempt was already extremely rare in the Morales family.\nTo put this matter into perspective, there were about a billion youths of this current Nova Generation. This was how insanely large the Morales family was.\nOf these billion youths, half would not even awaken a Lineage factor at all. Of the remaining half, about 70% would awaken the Spear Lineage Factor and just about 30% would awaken the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor.\nThis meant that there were 150 million youths with the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor awakened. Regardless of whether these youths were children born from Morales family women who had been married off to other families or not, they would all be considered as part of the Morales family main branch.\nOf this 150 million, 90% would only open the first door on their first attempt. Such people would only be able to open a maximum of the second or third door before they were forced to move onto the Fifth Dimensional barrier.\nThis left 15 million. Of this amount, another 90% would only be able to open the second door on their first attempt. For these people, no matter what they tried, it would be impossible to touch the fourth door as the fourth represented a qualitative leap. This was because the fourth door was the first marker of the Metal Synergy Runes!\nThis left just one and a half million. Of this amount, less than 100 000 would ever touch the fourth door. Not even 10 000 would managed to open the fifth. And, not even 1 000 would manage to touch the sixth!\nFinally, there was yet another qualitative leap. In some weaker generations of the Morales Clan, there might not be a single person who managed to open the seventh door on the first try! And, even in stronger ones, the number would most definitely not exceed 10 by a large margin!\nSo, one can imagine how talented the Nova Generation was. Not only was there one who had opened the ninth door on the first try, but there were an entire seven. Someone like Leonel who could open seven with just SIx Nodes was completely unheard of, however his talent was completely overshadowed due to the negligence of his 'senior'.\nThe truth was that what Leonel was aware of was the fact his attempts would only get more and more difficult with each attempt. He wouldn't naively jump into making mistakes like he had in the past. It was just that he had no choice. In this dangeous situation, if he didn't quickly grow stronger, he would only die here.\nThis was the price for his previous mistakes.\nBut, Leonel was unwilling. Even though he didn't know the significance of these doors, he simply didn't like having to stop at seven. He didn't even know others were watching him, nor did he know the true significance of the amount of doors he opened, but he just didn't want to stop here.\nLeonel slowly clenched his fists. His nails scraped along the surface of the first doors. With how sturdy it was, he could only leave a bloody trail.\nHis head tilted up, a resolute gaze flickering as he gazed toward the small opening in the door before him.\nThen, as though he had been grasped by a tinge of madness, he roared.\n…\nThe elders sighed as a collective, many of them turning away. At this point, they didn't even want to know the name of this youth, they could all only feel that it was a pity. If they knew the name of this youth, they might just feel that it was even more unfortunate. It was easier to avoid heartache if one didn't have a face to attach to it.\nSometimes it was easier to ignore tragedies with a large number of casualties as long as you were distant enough from the people it affected.\n\"I'm going to kill that damn bastard who led this kid astray.\" The billowing beard of the bullish elder was still frolicking about. His eyes were practically red as he watched Leonel's wavering runic patterns.\nWENG!\nIt was at that moment that those very runes suddenly turned red.\nThe elders looked over in astonishment.\n\"This kid is trying to get himself killed!\" The crooked-toothed elder's carefree grin had long since disappeared. Now he just looked forward in horror.\nThose red runes, they had seen them many times before. Youths who weren't satisfied with their results would sometimes have will power that surpassed their means. As a result, they would try to push ahead, but this would only end up damaging themselves. No small number of youths had killed themselves in this way.\nThey all recognized these signs very well. Bloodline Deviation.\nEven if Leonel failed to open all nine doors on the first try, it was still fine. He might have a chance at a comeback in the future if he worked diligently. After all, this was just the start of his path. But, if he died now, it was all for naught.\nThe elders became flustered.\n\"Dammit! Which planet is this kid from?! Contact all of them now and find out which prodigy is breaking through! Immediately stop him!\"\nThe bullish elder roared out orders to seemingly empty air, but the whole of the planet heard him. His rage caused a mad and immediate scramble that turned the entire Seventh Dimension into a frenzy.\nBut, no matter how they looked, they could have never imagined that Leonel was countless light years away on a small planet called Earth…\n…\nWithin his Bloodline World, Leonel's eyes had turned completely red. He seemed to have lost himself in a trance. All he had eyes for was the expanse of darkness beyond the crack in the doors.\nHis main body in the Lab Setting had become a rain of blood. The flickering crimson seemed to finally fuse perfectly into the beautiful, resplendent bronze. Instead of tainting it, it felt as though the light had gotten even brighter, creating a new red bronze color that shimmered like both gold and ruby.\nHowever, he had no idea that this only brought him a step closer to death.",

      "content": "Leonel could feel his blood seething. It was an exhilarating feeling that made him feel as though he was treading on clouds. He could never think that such ecstasy would cause panic countless galaxies away.\n'How wonderful would it be if I could feel this way for all of eternity…'\nIt was a simple thought — innocent, even. But it was this very thought that led to the deaths of so many Morales family youths in the past.\nThis feeling, it was like a drug. It was the kind of euphoria one could hardly find in life, yet it was also the very kind of euphoria that could rend the soul and send one to an early death.\nThe elders of the family could only watch on helplessly as the red lights grew fiercer and fiercer. Even when they saw the signs of the eighth door opening, they no longer felt the same happiness. All they saw was the tragedy of another fallen genius.\nIt could be said that though these elders were aloof and hardly made their presences known, they were filled with familial affection. Even that ungrateful bastard who stole their two family heirlooms was still spoken of fondly by the majority of them. After all, he was that singular genius of the Nebula Generation they spoke about who managed to open the ninth door on his first attempt.\nEven though they had seven more geniuses of this caliber, how could they not feel heartache? They only blamed themselves for not finding this prodigy earlier.\n…\nWithin the Lab Setting, the changes happening to Leonel shouldn't have been obvious. If it wasn't for the fact his own blood was pooling around his body as though seeking to form its own pool of liquid, it would be hard to tell that anything was happening at all.\nBut, at this moment, the instant Leonel touched upon the eighth door, the very same runes that had been etching them onto his skin made their way onto his bones. If his body was sliced open and his skeleton was revealed, it would be possible to see runes of red bronze being carved into them.\nThe sound was especially grating on the ears. It sounded as though a fork was being raked across a steel pot, grinding into it again and again.\nHowever, Leonel felt none of this pain. In fact, the longer it went on, the better he felt. It was almost like a release, a spike of dopamine he couldn't get enough of.\nMany would see pain as an annoyance. But in many ways, pain was the reason one could stay alive. The absence of pain could very easily lead to death. It was a necessary part of life.\nBut Leonel didn't even notice this. Even as his body was falling apart, there was a bloody smile hanging on his face. It would have been quite a sweet smile, the very smile he practiced to show to Aina, yet now, it just seemed… sad.\nWithin the Bloodline World, Leonel's figure looked no different. He had practically become a man of blood, dripping from head to toe as his fists pushed flush against the first door.\nHis eyes continued to gaze through the crack as though the expanse of darkness held his most fervent desire.\nIt was no longer a matter of will power. Could this even be considered will power? He loved this feeling. Could doing something that felt so good even require will power? -\n…\nThe crimson light within the Morales family sacred land had grown overwhelming. It pierced into the skies, growing to a height that almost matched the mountainous stick of incense.\nThe pillar was intertwined with runes of bronze, radiating a beautiful and majestic color. But, to the elders, it looked no different from the send off of a genius. A prodigy, dead just like this, even without letting the world see his brightness.\nMore and more elders shook their heads to leave. They weren't willing to dampen their moods any longer. Someone else would investigate this matter thoroughly and find all those responsible. This was definitely a capital crime. Whoever was responsible deserved to be executed.\n…\nLeonel's ragged breaths sounded out. By now, he sounded more like a beast in heat rather than a man near the end of his life.\nHe felt like he was so close. If pushing open the eighth door felt so good, how good would the ninth door feel? Wouldn't the pleasure drown him?\nHowever, at that moment, Leonel suddenly frowned.\nWhy did he feel a nagging itch in his heart? What was this annoying feeling.\n'I have to go to Aina…'\nYes, he already knew this. Wasn't that why he had to get out of this place? He would have a greater chance at saving Aina if he opened the ninth door. With how powerful this Lineage Factor was, wouldn't he be able to sweep through Terrain with ease?\nYes, yes. That was right. All he needed to do was open the ninth door.\n'Respect and Persistence in all things…'\nYes, he already understood this. Why was this running through his mind now? Wasn't he persisting right now? He was trying very hard. It was just that his reward for his persistence felt too good. Was that his fault?\n'Do you really understand what these two words mean…?'\nHis father's smiling visage appeared in his mind.\nThat old man was being annoying as usual, wearing that smug smile as he pushed his glasses up with a finger.\nOf course he already understood what those two words meant.\n'Do you really…?'\nLeonel faltered.\n'Nothing easily gained is worth attaining…'\nLeonel trembled.\nHe thought he had understood this fact as well. Wasn't that why he had been so stubborn previously? It was even to the point he ignored his own talent and tried to comprehend his Lineage Factors on his own.\nWasn't that what his father had met by Persistence?\nBut why did he feel like that understanding was so shallow… It was shallow to the point even he had abandoned those thoughts, realizing that it was his own haughtiness that brought him to this point.\nThe voice in his mind didn't speak again, but Leonel found that the doors he was pushing up against suddenly forced him to slide back. It was as though they were trying to remind him to push back… as though they wanted to remind him just how important opening the ninth door had been to him just a moment ago…\n'Nothing easily gained is worth attaining…'\nLeonel's dull eyes suddenly gained a sharpness. At that moment, a pain the likes of which he had never felt in his life suddenly assaulted him.\nHe raised his head and roared in pain, his cry shaking even the Force Crystal Mine.",

      "content": "The pain, it was unbearable.\nLeonel felt as though countless tiny knives were ripping through his skin and bone. He had never experienced such a thing in his life.\nIt could be said that the worst injury he had ever suffered was a few fractures to his ribcage. Even the flesh wound his hands had suffered had been mildly less painful than that. But, compared to this, those injuries were akin to an irritating paper cut.\nAt that moment, Leonel had every intention of letting go. It was too painful. If he just let these doors close, everything would be alright. Then, he could take a rest, and try again later. That would be fine, right?\nLeonel hadn't been one to lie to himself. He knew that he wasn't the hardest worker. He also knew that he didn't have the most resolute will.\nThese weren't things one was born with. The reason his father tried to ingrain those two values into him time and time again was to remind him the value of growth.\nHe was an 18 year old boy. He had hardly faced any hardships in his life. Though he lived on a Paradise Island, he had never truly felt restricted by it. And, even though he had lived in such a place, it wasn't as though they were slums. Each Paradise Island was well tended to and provided for.\nExpecting him to have the will to trample the heavens and sunder the earth like some anime character was absolutely ridiculous. Let alone having such will, he wasn't even sure what he wanted to do with his life just yet. He was a kid. Though he had some talent, he was ultimately just that. A kid.\nFor a kid like him, such pain was absolutely unbearable. But somehow, whenever he thought of letting go and allowing these doors to slam shut, tears uncontrollably fell from his eyes.\nSuch a thing surprised even himself. He wasn't an emotional person. Though he had been worried about his father when the Paradise Islands fell, he didn't break down back then. When Simeon and the Junior Governor Duke decided to fire into the homes of innocents, he hadn't burst into tears. Even when his father mentioned that his mother was still alive… his emotions hardly fluctuated.\nBut, there were also many times he did inexplicable things outside the bounds of his calm and cold logic, things even he couldn't explain. He put his life on the line to save the lives of English and Frenchmen he didn't know. He wanted to be with Aina for reasons even he found difficult to put into words. And right now… he really, really, really didn't want to let go.\nThese were tears of frustration, pain, and conflict.\nHe could feel the doors making him buckle under their weight. It was as though they were enraged he had suddenly regained his senses and now wanted to make him pay the greatest price. They wanted nothing more than to shatter him to a pile of bone and flesh.\nIf he took a step back, they might still give him a chance at survival. But, if he dared to take another step forward…\nThey would go all out to kill him!\nSometimes in life, the different paths people follow can be decided in an instant.\nThat was what people who were pretending to be profound said, anyway. In reality, things weren't so simple. A single decision couldn't change anything. It was a continuous stream of decisions that would decide the path you would follow.\nIt might take ten or even a hundred correct decisions to take a single step on the path you wanted. Maybe along the way, you might make many incorrect decisions as well. But only by persisting would you eventually become the person you wanted to be.\nLeonel was just a kid. A boy of barely 18 years old. Up to now, he had already made several incorrect decisions. However recently, he finally made his first correct one. That was to quell his arrogance and admit that he was wrong. And now… he would make his second.\nIt was quite the pitiful sight. When the world spoke of his exploits in the future, they would never know that an overlord who could overturn the universe with a single palm was once a young boy who had a face filled with tears and snot during his first attempt to release the shackles of his bloodline…\n\"AGH!\"\nLeonel took a step forward. He heard the sound of his legs cracking, but the adrenaline rush flowed throughout his body, masking the pain for but a moment.\nHe screamed his throat hoarse. Even he didn't know why he kept going. All he knew was that these damn tears wouldn't stop if he took a step back.\nThat was right. He wasn't crying because of the pain. That was his story, and he was sticking to it.\nBANG! WENG! WENG! WENG!\n…\nWithin the sacred land of the Morales family, the elders suddenly snapped their heads back in the direction of the red pillar of light, only to find that the red color was receding to be replaced by a resplendent purple light. It was the kind of beautiful violet that would enchant any woman, yet carried an air of nobility that made one want to prostrate themselves. Even these elders of who knows how many years felt the urge to bow down.\n\"Purple light? What's going on?\"\nThe elders were stunned. They didn't know what this purple light meant.\nThe flagship color of their Lineage Factor had always been a shimmering bronze. The only exception was during Bloodline Deviation when it would become red, but that was basically a death sentence. The number of clan members who had survived Bloodline Deviation in their long history could be counted on one's hands…\nBut violet? This had never happened before. Even the nine doors of the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Dimensional shackles of their Lineage Factor didn't carry such a color. They would always be bronze, the only difference was the brightness of their light and their strength.\nOf course… the fact their bloodline shackles had five sets of doors and not four like the masses thought was a deeply held secret. Leonel hadn't thought much of it when he saw five sets of doors, having no idea how tightly held such a thing was.\n\"The ninth door!\"\nSuddenly, one of the elders called out in shock. They had been so caught up in the shocking color that they hadn't noticed that the signature of the ninth door had appeared.\nThe first three doors was a progressive purification of their bronze color… the fourth door formed the Runic Crown… the fifth form was the Force Node Runes… the sixth form the Force Skin Runes… the seventh form the Force Vessel Runes… the eighth form the Force Bone Runes… and the ninth form… Was the Force Halo Runes.\nA grand violet bronze halo appeared above Leonel's head, causing the ground beneath him to shatter. In fact, it was to the point that a hole was blasted through the Segmented Cube entirely, causing him to almost fall through and directly onto the Force Crystal Core below. Luckily, a barrier was quickly formed, protecting him from such a tragedy.\nAt that moment, within his Bloodline World, Leonel pushed with his last bit of strength, causing the nine doors to blast apart of their own accord.\nHe hardly noticed the lights of bronze and violet that descended onto him before he fainted.",

      "content": "The elders stood completely stunned. They had no ability to understand what was happening.\nIt wasn't like there had never been anyone who survived Bloodline Deviation before. However, their number was extremely small. In addition, those who survived would all lose the right to enter their Bloodline World again in addition to losing access to their Lineage Factor. They would essentially be crippled in that respect.\nBut, this was obviously not what was happening here. Everything pointed toward a successful awakening. If it wasn't for the fact there was a royal violet color infused with the usual bronze, these elders would think that Leonel had somehow reversed everything at the final moment.\nJust… what was happening?\nThose elders who had turned to leave charged back, each of them jostling for position. If before they wanted to know nothing about this youth, they now wanted to know everything. How could they miss out on learning this youth's name?\nThe lights slowly faded and the hidden tablet began to gradually come into view.\nThe tablet seemed to swallow all the violet bronze lights in the air, converging on a single name at the very bottom of the stone tablet.\n'The bottom? This brat is so young?'\nThe rankings on the Nova Generation Tablet, or any ancestral tablet for that matter, wasn't based on standing or rank or anything of the sort. It was purely based on the time you were born.\nThe eldest of the generation would be ranked first while the youngest would be ranked last. It was only after a certain coming of age event that the order would be reshuffled. By then, age would no longer be the deciding facter of rank.\nBut, one could imagine how large a tablet that could hold a billion names would be. Yet, ironically, ranking last was just as conspicuous as ranking first, especially since Leonel's name stood out so much!\nUpon awakening the Spear Domain Lineage Factor, a name would gain a sharp edge to it that radiated a kingly might. In the universe, there were many weapons factions, but the struggle between the spear and the sword had always been the most violent. Both of them were seen as the king of weapons by their respective wielders, so there would always be clashes between the two.\nUpon awakening the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, a name would gain a heavy aura and also a bronze sheen to it, standing out from the other stone carved names.\nObviously, upon awakening both, one would gain a fusion of the two.\nIt was already outstanding enough that Leonel's name had both characteristics. After all, there were only seven others like this. However, even compared to them, his stood out just that level more because in addition to a bronze sheen, his name was also surrounded by a violet aura.\n\"Leonel Morales…\" The crooked toothed elder muttered. \"… Have any of you heard of this brat?\"\nThe elders looked at one another for confirmation, but all they found were numerous shaking heads. There were a billion youths, how could they know all of them?\nIn truth, with their strength, memorizing the names and faces of a billion people wasn't an issue. The issue was whether or not they found such a thing to be worthy of their time.\n\"He's this generation's little brother, though. If I remember correctly, the last time a name appeared on the Nova Generation Tablet was 18 years ago…\"\nThe elders sucked in a cold breath. Awakening both Lineage Factors before 20?\n\"Let's look at the Nebula Generation Tablet.\"\nHearing this suggestion, the elders all nodded.\nThe timelines in the universe were never linear. The future could influence the past in the same way the past could influence the future. If their son awakened in this fashion, it was possible for the father to gain some benefits as well. In this way, it might be possible to learn who Leonel was through who his father or mother was.\nHowever, the elders found no changes on the Nebula Generation Tablet.\nThey all looked toward one another with a solemn expression.\nThe only way such an awakening wouldn't influence the previous generation is if the previous generation was already too powerful to cause such a change. But, the number strong enough to fall into this category would definitely not number more than a thousand.\nThe issue was if any of these thousand had such an outstanding descendant, how could it be possible that they'd be unaware?\nAs such, there were only two explanations.\nOne possibility was that this person of the Nebula Generation purposely withheld this offspring of theirs… If this was the case, the elders couldn't help but shudder. How could there ever be a good reason for doing such a thing?\nThe second possibility was…\nThinking of this, all the elders had gazes that shone like bright torches. There was only —\nJust when the elders were thinking this, several powerful auras suddenly converged and a mighty voice sounded out from the skies.\n\"… The violet winds rise north…\"\nA soft sigh rang through the sacred lands.\n\"… Forget the matters of today and don't investigate any longer. The child is not within our lands.\" A sigh rang out once again. \"… Just as much of a troublemaker as his father…\"\nThe elders below didn't dare to say much. Even after all the auras disappeared, they only looked at each other once and left silently. Inwardly, they all knew that their second speculation must be correct.\n**\nWithin the Segmented Cube, Leonel gasped awake just in time to find a last thread of violet bronze light seeping into his body.\nHe smile bitterly as he looked around. The Lab Setting was a complete mess. He was shocked to find that there was even a hole beneath where he lay. If it wasn't for some sort of odd energy barrier, he would have fallen right through.\nHowever, just when he was feeling depressed, a strong surge of Force suddenly swept through the Segmented Cube.\nLeonel's eyes lit up. He immediately understood what was happening.\nThe Segmented Cube had absorbed enough Force to enter Phase Two!",

      "content": "Leonel smiled.\nThe evolution didn't take very long at all. In fact, it could be considered to have happened in the blink of an eye.\nThe Lab Setting doubled in size. But, surprisingly, the outside view of the Segmented Cube actually shrunk by a size down to a five meter radius. In addition, it seemed that it's exterior was a level sturdier. At the very least, the Force Eruption no longer seemed to affect it as much anymore.\nLeonel didn't have time to slowly figure out what changes occurred, so this time, he directly asked the dictionary.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, Phase One of Segmented Cube provides Suspended Animation and the Black Grade Soothing Water. Phase Two provides the Bronze Grade Soothing Waters and Evolution Nurturing. ]\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. \"What is Evolution Nurturing?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Natural Treasures within the means of Phase Two can be nurtured for growth. ]\n\"What is within the means of Phase Two?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ At and below the Fourth Dimensional Grade. ]\nAfter a few more questions, Leonel came to understand everything.\nIt turned out that he was right to store the ores and herbs he gained within the snowglobes. In there, they could be nurtured to slowly grow and produce more of their kind. Though it would still take a long time, it was better than nothing.\nIn addition, according to the dictionary, it he found more Cores of the same kind, he could place them within the same environment and they would be able to mutually work together to expedite growth.\nAfter knowing this, Leonel immediately separated the snowglobes into groups and put like minerals and herbs together. He didn't even have to stand to do this. After entering Phase Two, especially with his powerful spirit, he was able to control most of the matters of the Segmented Cube with his mind.\nThese ores would become especially important to him in the future. Not because of Force Crafting, but rather because of a special ability of his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor. Unfortunately, he didn't have the time to explore this right now.\nLeonel finally tried to push himself up. But, what he could ahve never expected was that he would fall flat on his face an instant later.\n'What the hell…? Why am I so heavy?'\nLeonel's expression changed as he swept his spirit over his own body. The change to his stats left him speechless.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 4.57; Speed: 0.87; Agility: 0.63; Coordination: 0.91; Stamina: 1.13 (+0.05 - nullified); Reactions: 2.03; Spirit: 5.98; Force: 0.60]\nFirst, he was stunned that his strength actually more than doubled. But, in return, his speed and agility had actually fallen by more than half, not to mention his stamina. On top of that, his coordination, which had once been among his highest stats alongside his spirit had actually plummeted as well.\nHe immediately understood. His Metal Synergy Lineage Factor had actually increased his weight by so much. Now, he wasn't much different from the metal A-grade Invalid he had met all those months ago, having great strength, but even greater limitations to his ability to use it.\nLeonel didn't panic after realizing this. He didn't believe that such a powerful Lineage Factor would have such a great weakness. If he was no different from a mere A-grade Invalid, the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor wouldn't be worth all the praise and adulation the dictionary gave it.\nAfter taking a breath, Leonel used his overwhelming spirit to sweep through the changes in his body. Soon, he found the problem.\nThough the Runes on his skin had already disappeared, that was just a superficial measure. The Runes that ran through his blood vessels, and even more importantly his bones, had yet to recede.\nAfter a moment, Leonel felt he could control them and slowly forced them into retreat.\nSoon, the heaviness of his body vanished. He realized that his strength was still great, being above 3.00, but the reduction to his speed was much less exaggerated. In fact, compared to before, his speed and agility had also increased.\n[Leonel Morales]\n[Strength: 3.27; Speed: 2.17; Agility: 2.64; Coordination: 2.01; Stamina: 4.98 (+0.05 - nullified); Reactions: 2.03; Spirit: 5.98; Force: 0.60]\n'My Lineage Factor is stil in its infant stages. If I was with the Morales family, the moment I completed my awakening, I would immediately start absorbing all sorts of precious ores. But, I don't have the luxury to do so right now.'\nThere were two main abilities of the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor that allowed it to reign supreme. The first was its Divine Metal Absorption ability and the second was its Divine Armor Deity ability.\nLeonel believed that the weaknesses in his Lineage Factor would all be solved by the time he began to practice these two abilities.\nLeonel was beginning to feel that his stat system was too limited. When he finally had time to relax, he had to think of something better…\nWith that thought, Leonel stood and entered the Abode Setting. He had to speak to the other three youths. However, he didn't expect the three of them to look at him as though they were seeing some kind of monster. If it wasn't for their masks, their expressions might have been even more exaggerated.\nFlowing Wind stepped forward, looking Leonel up and down.\n\"Handsome… How'd you get more handsome?\"\nFlowing Wind looked up at Leonel with a serious expression.\nThe changes in Leonel were simply too exaggerated.\nNow, he stood just over two meters tall, crossing the 6'6 mark. His skin was just as tanned as it had always been, but it seemed smoother and more flawless, even to the point of radiating an incredibly faint bronze light.\nAs though this wasn't enough, his dirty blond hair had become a bright copper color. It was like his hair had been formed by individual, flexible filaments of the metal, sweeping across his shoulders with an inhuman sheen to it.\nBut the greatest change was to his aura. They all gravitated toward him uncontrollably. As unreserved as Flowing Wind usually was, even she felt somewhat stifled at this moment.\nAt this point, he really did look like some Roman God.\n\"Huh?\"\nLeonel tilted his head in confusion. He hadn't observed himself in the mirror. Even when he used his spirit to observe his body, it was only the inside of his body. So, he had no idea why their reactions were so exaggerated.\nThat said, he didn't have the time to mind it.\n\"I'm confident in bringing us all away now and have a way to mature the Force Crystal Mine Core. Stay put here, I will take us out soon.\"\nWith the Segmented Cube gaining such a Phase Two ability, Leonel really could mature the Core now.\nEverything should have been made simple but… The only issue was that the situation outside had changed, leaving Leonel a bit helpless. Thanks to the evolution of the Segmented Cube, Leonel could even access the situation outside its walls now.\nFirst, the little mink had woken up and was even curiously observing the Force Eruption.\nIf that was all, things would still be fine. But, with the increase in his spirit, Leonel could finally see the edges of this vast kilometer long space clearly. Thanks to that, he noticed several tunnels he hadn't in the past. And… one of those tunnels led to a valley a group of people were currently exploring…\nIt wouldn't be long before they found this place.",

      "content": "Leonel dropped down from the Segmented Cube, a hint of caution in his pale green eyes. But, after a moment, he realized that he was indeed correct.\nEven without activating his Runes, the Force Eruption only put a minor amount of pressure on him. It was enough for him to feel uncomfortable, as though he was suffering from a stomach ache. However, it was no longer enough to threaten his life. And this was without his using a Force Skin!\nLeonel knew that if he activated his Force Runes now, even if it was only the crown of the fourth door, this discomfort would vanish completely. However, there was no need to do this, at least not for now. He still wanted to observe the situation.\n\"How long will it take to mature the Crystal Core if the Segmented Cube used its Evolution Nurturing ability?\"\n[ *Ping*]\n[ 12:23:04 ]\nLeonel was pleasantly surprised. Just half a day?\nBut after some thought, he felt that this made sense. The Segmented Cube was a treasure from a higher Dimensional world. In addition, its goal was to evolve the Crystal Mine into the Fourth Dimension, not the Fifth. As such, how could it not do so with ease?\nDespite learning this, Leonel didn't have the Segmented Cube begin so quickly. In fact, it might very well be the Force Eruption that helped Leonel make it through this.\nLeonel's spine tingled, causing him to subconsciously turn in a certain direction.\n'This damned little mink…'\nLeonel realized then that his thinking might have been a bit naive. He had almost forgotten that there was another being who could ignore the Force Eruption as well.\nAt that moment, the little mink was still gliding around the walls of the Force geyser. After Leonel's spirit had crossed into the Fifth Dimension, not only had the range of his Internal Sight increased explosively, even to the point of being capable of crossing tens of kilometers, but Force of the Fourth Dimension was no longer able to hinder his senses.\nSo, whereas in the past he could hardly see the situation around him in this place. Now, everything was as clear as day.\nIn fact, it should be said that Fifth Dimensional Internal Sight should be capable of far more than just this. After all, a Fifth Dimensional entity acting upon even the Fourth Dimension was akin to stomping ants, let alone a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional world like this one. But unfortunately, Leonel was still limited by the weakness of the rest of his body.\nStill, in this sort of situation, it was more than enough.\n'I don't think it knows I'm here… But should I battle it now, or…?'\nThe little mink might have only been 10 meters from him, but it had no ability to see or sense Leonel. After all, not everyone had spirit as monstrous as him.\nAt that moment, Leonel's senses latched on to a hearty laughter. If he was only relying on his ears, this laughter would have never reached him. After all, there was too much Force in the air, making this large space — that should have been a great echo chamber — become insulated from noise.\nLeonel's lip curled. It seemed that they had finally found this place.\n'Why not make my two enemies fight one another?'\n…\nOutside the Force Mine, Simeon couldn't hold back his laughter. He was usually a reserved individual who thought of nothing else but his own struggle for power. But at this moment, he was genuinely too happy.\nLeonel and the other youths had only made it to this place barely a month ago, but he had already been here for much longer, looking for a path to the Force Crystal Mine.\nHe had always known it was here, but it wasn't as though he could ask the Slayer Legion for their map. Unfortunately, he had really met too many struggles. What should have been a quick and easy mission to infuriate the Slayer Legion had become a test of his own mental fortitude.\nBut now, it was perfect. Everything was worth it now. In fact, the Force Eruption was also a great help to him. With it, it would be unlikely that the Slayer Legion would send their promising youths here. It was too much of a risk. In addition, they couldn't send anyone of the elder generation, or else his own backers wouldn't sit idly by.\n'I can steal all your wealth and you can't say anything about it… How satisfying!'\nAfter regaining his calm, Simeon's expression once more settled back to his usual haughty air.\n\"Seven, take the vanguard. You must last 10 minutes, or of what use are you to me?\"\n\"Yes, Young Lord!\"\nSimeon named all his subordinates by numbers even though they had their own names. Even the wererat Leonel had killed before was known as rat 006, one of his more precious test subjects.\nHowever, those who could be called by numbers without prefixes were most definitely the most powerful of his men.\nAfter taking the vanguard, Seven's Force surged. But, he wasn't the only one.\nEight men and women stood around Simeon in a protective circle. However, around them, in an even larger encirclement, there were at least 30 other warriors. It was these 30 that also surged with Force along with Seven.\nThe Force coalesced, winding together almost like a living breathing beast.\nTo the naked eye, it seemed as though nothing at all was happening. However, if one had awakened Internal Sight, it would truly be something worth witnessing.\nThe Force rose up. At first, there was only a vague cube-like manifestation. But soon, this cube began to break into peaks and valleys.\nThe start of the process was slow. But akin to a ball rolling down a hill, it became faster and faster. Then, it seemed like in the blink of an eye, it all solidified, forming a grandiose palace. No, it was more accurate to say that this was a small replica of a palace, only capable of housing 100 or so people if they all stood as close as possible to one another.\nAt this point, the Palace had become corporeal. Like this, even those without Internal Sight could make out its vague outline. And, to those with Internal Sight, it felt like an air of majesty was crashing down upon them, wanting them to kneel in submission.\nSimeon and his men huddled together. After their Young Lord was satisfied, they walked through the path they had found, stepping into the boundless underground world of the Force Crystal Mine.\nSimeon felt like he was walking on a cloud. If he knew that Leonel hardly reacted to this world of crystals, he would have shamed him as a country bumpkin. This place was filled with billions of Force Crystals! Just how many elites could be raised by this kind of mine?\nHowever, Simeon knew that it would be foolish to try and take it all away. This was still the Slayer Legion's territory. His plan wasn't to seek out these little benefits. What he wanted was the Force Crystal Core. Even though the Force Eruption was outside his expectations, he? still had methods to deal with it.\nIn addition, he was also excited about the natural treasures that could be birthed in this environment. Force Crystal Mines were always accompanied by such treasures.\n'I'll retrieve the Core first. Then, I can seek out other benefits after it's secured.'\nThe group continued to walk forward. Their destination was very easy to spot. After all, a geyser of white that could even be seen with the naked eye was right before them.\nLeonel watched all of this happen from within the Force geyser, feeling quite helpless. There were such techniques to protect against Force Eruptions as well? It truly made his own methods seem poor by comparison.\nIn the future, when he gained enough skill to upgrade the dictionary, he would most definitely change this straight forward habit of its…\n'Go on little mink, help me vent some of my frustration…'\nThe moment Leonel had this thought, the little mink had already pounced, causing him no small bit of pleasure.\nHowever, his smile slowly faded, giving way to a cold intent. The monocle wearing bastard definitely needed to die today.\n…\nThe little mink was feeling quite pleased with itself.\nIt had been the first to find this place thanks to its small size and unique abilities. Walls? How could they possibly stop it. It could pass through them with ease.\nUnexpectedly, its ability was actually triggered to another level upon reaching this place. Now it was even more formidable than it had been in the past. The only detestable thing was that someone had actually attacked it in its sleep. How despicable.\nDidn't that person see how adorable it was? How could it stand to attack it?\nLuckily, it had great abilities and that despicable person hadn't been able to touch a hair on its noble head, or else how would the world live on without it?\nThe little mink didn't think much about these things. It only knew that if it had gained so many benefits just from being so far away from the Force Eruption, how many more benefits would it gain by approaching the center? Something was telling it that there was something very good over there, but there was also something else telling it that it was very dangerous as well.\nSo, it ran around the outside, sometimes on the ground, sometimes gliding through the air, trying to see if it could get a greater sense of what was hidden inside.\nIt could only sigh to itself as it continued to circle the Force geyser. It had found such a good playmate, it was a shame that its playmate had disappeared. It couldn't sense its playmate as easily as it had before.\nHm?\nThe little mink looked up and beared its adorable little teeth.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nSomeone actually dared come here to snatch its things? Were these the despicable people that attacked it?\nIt was definitely going to teach them a lesson.",

      "content": "The members of the Brazinger family were caught completely off guard.\nIn one instant, they were happily thinking about all of the rewards they would reap on this journey, and in the next, a flash of black light appeared before their palace of Force, crashing into it with a loud BANG!\nThe little mink rebounded off the shield, confusion coloring its adorable features.\nIt was clear that it hadn't been hurt by the rebound. In fact, this was a benefit of its Shadow World ability. Its body was perpetually existing on two planes, so any attacks it suffered would only be half effective. It could only be said that the little guy had a truly broken ability and who knows how it had evolved now?\nStill, that didn't stop the little mink from being shocked. The only thing it had ever been unable to go directly through was the light attacks of its playmate. It didn't think that this illusory palace could also stop it like this.\nIf the Brazinger family people knew what the little mink was thinking, they'd likely be coughing up blood in rage.\nThough the little mink hadn't managed to cross through their defenses, its actions had caused Seven to directly spit up several mouthfuls of blood. The backlash was so severe that the palace nearly collapsed. If it wasn't for the fact Seven feared what his Young Lord would do to him if he really let the palace fall, the technique would have collapsed in the first instant.\n\"Young Lord! This little beast has comprehended a Force Strengthening Deviation! The Four Corner Palace Formation won't last long!\"\nSimeon's expression darkened. This little beast actually dared to ruin its plans like this?\nUnfortunately, Simeon's ability wasn't beast taming. Beast taming was just a product of him putting his genetic manipulation ability into affect. In order to do this, he needed his victim to be completely restrained and he also needed time to perform several complex calculations. It was completely impossible for him to take control of this little mink with ease.\nHowever, after a few moments of thought, his frown gave way to a smile.\nA beast that had comprehended a Force Strengthening Deviation? How valuable was that? Though he had other beasts of this caliber, it was clear that this little mink's Force Strengthening Deviation wasn't normal. It was very likely of an exceptionally high grade.\nLeonel watched all of this from a distance, his expression growing solemn.\n'The little bastard actually didn't manage to break it in a single hit…'\nBy Leonel's estimations, that charge attack of the little mink carried with it over 3.00 points of strength. With it concentrated into such a fine point, its power per square inch was a few levels above even the explosions Leonel's Quasi Bronze energy shield suffered all those months ago. Yet, his chain necklace almost shattered completely back then.\nWhat did this mean? It meant that this technique, a Formation Technique as that man referred to it as, was at least on par with his chain necklace.\n\"Four, Three, Two — Go deal with that little mink. Don't let it near the Palace Formation again.\"\n\"Yes, Young Lord!\"\nTwo women and a man dashed out from the Formation. The two women were Four and Two respectively, while the man was Three. Four carried a bow and a quiver of arrows, Three carried a two-handed sword, and Two brandished a whip that had a length of over ten meters.\nLeonel quickly matched these three with the information he had gotten from his interrogation.\nSimeon's abilities were still limited. For now, he could only provide boosts to physical attributes. Though rat 006 had had a mental ability, he had awakened with it even before he was genetically modified.\nThanks to Simeon, the stats of all three of these warriors hovered around 3.00. However, if they undid the genetic locks Simeon placed on them, they would gain a 20% boost to their abilities.\nAfter matching the descriptions and weapons together, Leonel understood who they were. Four had an A-grade telekinesis ability, allowing her to control her arrows within a range of 50 meters. Three had an A-grade energy type ability which sharpened his Force, essentially giving him the equivalent of a Force Strengthening Deviation. Finally, Two had an S-grade metal manipulation ability. The links of her whip had small metal veins embedded into it, not only making it far sturdier than a normal whip, but also allowing her deft control over it.\n'That is definitely not the limit of Two's abilities… I need to be careful of her.'\nAs an extra measure of caution, Leonel used the dictionary to double check the information those two captives had given him. After confirming their abilities, he nodded.\nAt this moment, the little mink and the three had already clashed. Or rather… they had tried to clash, but all the attacks they levied went right through the little mink.\nThe three warriors turned serious.\nThree took a strong step forward. His internally cultivated Force was entirely focused on maintaining the Force Skin around him. However, his ability had shot into overdrive, causing the air to whistle around his great sword as he swung toward the little mink.\nThe little mink dodged to the side by a hair's breath, leaping toward the spine of the sword to run up it. However, in the next instant it cried out and jumped backward, its little paws having been injured.\n\"It's weak to Force Strengthening Deviations!\" Three said confidently.\nWith his ability, he could rip out Force from the air and sharpen it to magnify his attack. Though the Force was too volatile in this place for him to have great control, in some ways, this was also a benefit. If not for this, how could the spine of his blade also be sharp?\nHearing his words, the eyes of the two women lit up.\nWENG! WENG!\nSharp winds kicked up around Two while a fiery blaze lit the tips of Four's arrows.\nWithout pause, they launched their next attacks.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nThe little mink's back arched as its hair stood on end. It bared its little teeth. This time, it was truly enraged.",

      "content": "The little mink knew that all this wasn't normal. There were beasts on this island that had Force Strengthening Deviations as well, but they had still never been able to hurt it. The only explanation was that this place, while restricting the control these three had, was also amplifying their strength as well.\nIt wasn't as though the little mink's thoughts were so intricate. It mostly worked on instinct, having the intelligence of a three year old child at best.\nBut, what it did know was that if the abilities of its enemies were amplified… so were its.\nThe little mink brandished its small claw, swiping at the air.\nA scythe of black manifested, tearing through the fearsome momentum. In the blink of an eye, it was already several times larger than the little mink that had cast it out. However, it's power had also been spread out just as well.\nDespite this, the expressions of the three warriors still changed.\nThree took the vanguard, roaring as he slashed downward. Four rapidly retreated and Two brandished her whip like a cyclone, creating a barrier of sharp winds and clanging metal.\nThe three were forced into a furious retreat.\nLooking toward the enraged little mink, apprehension colored their expressions. That attack had been greatly diluted, yet it still took the three of them working together to dispel it. Just what was going on with this little mink?\nBeasts this powerful shouldn't be on this island. According to the ranking system set out by the Slayer Legion, such a beast could only appear on an A Sector Project Hunt Island. Why would it appear on a B Sector island?\nOne had to know that these regulations were tightly controlled. Project Hunt provided a great opportunity, but it could also pose a great threat to Earth as well. They were essentially raising powerful enemies for themselves. So, how could these islands not be tightly monitored?\nThe only explanation for this was either that this little mink had only recently evolved to have this level of strength or that it was simply too good at escaping… It might very well be both…\nRealizing this, the three grew serious. Though each of them was confident in taking on this little mink alone, they were on a time line. The Young Lord had already said he wanted Seven to last for 10 minutes. With how demanding the Young Lord was, one could deduce that lasting for this period of time was definitely difficult.\nNow that the Formation had actually been damaged, it was likely that he would last for even less time. If that was the case, Seven would have to be swapped out. But, Seven's abilities were the most suited to being the core of the Formation!\nIn that case, they had to end it as quickly as possible.\nFour was the first to react. Her body began to morph, her long, slender legs growing in size as large pink wings appeared to her back. Her nose grew in size as well, becoming slightly more hooked in nature as she shot into the skies, brandishing her bow and arrows time and time again as though she couldn't tire.\nThree reacted swiftly as well. His body grew half a meter in size, his back becoming somewhat hunched over. Muscles bulged along his arms and a patch of dense hair burst out from his chest.\nTwo was the last and experienced the least changes. However, if one looked more closely, it was possible to see that her nails had gained a metallic hue and grown about an inch. In addition to this, her pupils grew just a slight bit more narrowed as though she was a feline prepared to pounce.\nFrom Four to Two, each seemed more human than the last. But it became very clear, very quickly, that this only made them more powerful.\nThree's speed was completely unlike what it had been before. With Four raining down flaming arrows from all sides, the paths of retreat the little mink had were completely limited.\nThe little mink dodged time and time again, trying to find an opening to lash out, but its intelligence was still too lacking.\nIt wanted to get rid of the annoying man in front of it, but it would fall into a rage whenever Four shot an arrow at it. Like this, it kept bouncing back and forth between wanting to attack Four and Three, causing it to end up threatening neither of them.\nTwo didn't attack at all. It was clear that she was content to observe the situation, stalking her prey.\nThe 'yips' of the little mink filled the space. Even with the noise nullifying effects of the space, its enraged calls traveled far.\nIt jumped about wildly, sometimes using the ground and even sometimes using the air as a platform. But, it seemed to be getting nowhere.\nIn the distance, Leonel couldn't help but sigh. 'This little bastard is so useless. You gave me all this trouble yet you can't take down even one of them?'\nThough Leonel was shaking his head, he knew it wasn't because the little guy was weak, but because it didn't know how to use its strength. Usually beasts could make up for their lack of intelligence with strong physiques and large bodies, but the little guy had neither.\nLeonel suspected that the little guy's ability was great, but it was also highly dependent on how it was used. In Leonel's hands, he would likely be undefeatable of Earth with it. Unfortunately, it wasn't his ability, nor did he have the means to control beasts.\nThe little mink finally couldn't take it anymore.\nIt charged ahead recklessly, its deep black eyes holding a hint of red.\nTwo's gaze narrowed as her forearm flexed. This was exactly what she had been waiting for. Even Simeon's lip curled into a sneer.\n\"Don't kill it, it will have its uses.\"\nTwo nodded in acknowledgment, but her whip had already pierced forward. It shot out like an arrow, leaving a streak of black and silver in the air.\nHowever, the little mink's burst of speed was out of all of their expectations.\nIt appeared before Three, baring its teeth. Its hair stood on end as though trying to make itself seem far bigger than it was.\nThree, though caught off guard, was still a veteran of many battles.\nHe sunk into a practiced stance, using this momentum to slide a small distance away. Knowing that his sword was too large to be used at such a close distance, his left hand dropped from the hilt and pulled a knife from his hip, slashing out toward the little mink.\nHowever, what he couldn't have expected was for the little mink to completely vanish.\nSeeing such a scene, Leonel finally grinned. He was wondering why this little guy hadn't used this ability yet. It used it all the time against him. He almost felt like the little mink was playing favorites.\nThe knife slash completely missed.\nThree's eyes widened in horror, but it was already too late. The little mink's claws tore his Force Skin to pieces, tearing out a piece of his neck.\nUnfortunately for the little mink, Two's whip also arrived at that time. With her metal control, she could adjust her strike even while it was in the air. How could she not react appropriately?\nBANG!\nThe little mink was sent flying, its torso completely ripped through, leaking out a black, foggy aura along with dripping crimson blood.",

      "content": "Leonel sighed.\nThough he 'hated' the little mink for annoying him for so long, he still couldn't feel happy seeing it end like this. The truth was that the little mink wasn't just 'annoying' him, the little guy had almost driven him to his death many times.\n'Whatever, it's best it dies like this. It's too great of a variable.'\n\"Go and collect it.\" Simeon's voice rang out. \"We're running out of time.\"\nWhen Leonel heard this, his expression changed. It wasn't because Simeon was so uncaring about the death of Three, but rather because he had forgotten to consider what would happen if Simeon took control of the little mink like he had done all the other king beasts currently protecting the hive.\nLeonel had no doubt that the outside world was currenty in chaos right now. The beasts from the ocean had most definitely long since charged onto the island. Maybe the only reason they had yet to cause changes in the hive even after so long was precisely because of the beast kings under Simeon's control.\nSimeon was already so powerful. If he gained a subordinate like the little mink, it would really be over.\n'If I had known it was so weak to Force Strengthening Deviations, I could have killed it a long time ago. Dammit…'\nThe recklessness of his past was really coming back to bite him. Back then, he had used harpoons to target the little mink and not Light Elemental Force. Had he used the latter, he probably wouldn't even have to worry about it.\nLeonel knew about Simeon's ability, but he didn't know anything about exactly how it worked. He didn't know how long it would take for Simeon to take control of the little mink. If it was instant, or even if it was just a few minutes, Leonel would be in trouble.\nFive — one of Simeon's subordinates — had an A-grade healing ability. It was quite possible that if Simeon could take control of the little mink, Leonel would be in a world of trouble.\n'Even after all this, you're still giving me problems.'\nWithout another choice, Leonel grit his teeth and rushed out of the Force geyser. At the very least, he had to kill the little mink before it could be of any use to Simeon. Or, he just had to defeat them before Simeon had the chance to get his hands on the little guy.\nIt could be said that the very last thing the Brazinger family members could have ever expected was for another person to suddenly come rushing out of the Force Eruption.\nSimeon was especially shocked. He didn't immediately recognize Leonel because the changes in him were too striking. Plus, the last time he had seen Leonel was only for a brief moment in the Governor Duke's residence. And, back then, Leonel had had a tired and disheveled appearance, nothing like the valiant aura he was giving off now.\nThe true reason Simeon was shocked wasn't because he recognized Leonel, but rather because he knew more about Force Eruptions than Leonel had just a few days ago. Charging out of a Force Eruption like that should ahve been impossible, unless…\n\"Retreat! He's very powerful!\"\nSimeon immediately took command. He knew he couldn't be laid back any longer. At this moment, his true disposition took the lead, causing Leonel to raise an eyebrow.\nIt seemed he had underestimated Simeon a bit. However, that was all. He knew that Simeon was on a time crunch. But, unlike Simeon, he didn't have to worry about the Force Eruption at all.\nA spear appeared in Leonel's hand as he leapt into the air.\nHe didn't want to make it obvious that his target was the little mink. After all, the three warriors were much closer to the little beast than he was. If he made his target obvious, they might first retreat with the little mink. However… If he targeted Four first, it was a different matter entirely.\nThe expression of Four changed. 'So fast…'\nNot only had Leonel awakened the Wisdom Branch of his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor, but this had caused an indirect boost to his control over the Light Element. Though he should still be at the first stage, there was still a 10% boost over his previous speed.\nBy the time Four realized that she just might die, Leonel had already appeared before her. She couldn't help but shudder when she looked into Leonel's eyes. There was a cold, calculating glint within them as though he didn't care about how many lives he reaped.\nIn reality, this wasn't the case. Leonel was inherently a person who didn't like to kill. However, he no longer let it rule his mind. As a result, he could focus on the battle entirely.\nThis 'cold' look in his eyes wasn't indifference, but rather was the state he entered when he activated his ability.\nHis thoughts whirred past at impossible speeds. The world became a series of numbers, angles and probabilities. The entire battlefield was reflected in his mind, becoming no different from his chess board.\nLeonel's treasure shoes glowed green as he shot forward, reaching an even higher level of speed. His spear pierced through the air, appearing before Four's throat.\nHow could Four even defend? She was an archer. Even though her close combat skills were also not bad… What could she do to Leonel?\nPCHUU\nFour's eyes widened in horror, looking toward the spear piercing through her throat and spine as though she still couldn't believe it. Even as her eyes dulled… she still couldn't.\n'Why didn't I fly away…'\nThese were the last thoughts she had. Her shock hadn't come from Leonel's speed or his power, but rather the fact she really hadn't thought of something so simple. How laughable, a veteran of battle like her… dying in such a way.\nBy this point, Two had also reacted. She completely forgot about the little mink, what did it matter if there was another enemy right before her? But, what happened next shocked her even more.\nInstead of dodging her whip, Leonel actually reached out a hand to snatch it.\nTwo thought he had lost his mind, but also inwardly sneered. Was her whip really so simple to catch? Even a normal horse whip could lacerate a human's skin. In addition, she had already assumed that the light beneath Leonel's feet was related to his ability, so he couldn't also have a defensive ability, right?\nBut, reality was cruel.\nBeautiful bronze Runes covered Leonel's hands and forearms as he snatched the whip out of the air. A stinging pain assaulted his senses, yet, other than reddening a bit, his skin wasn't affected in the least.\nWith a single pull Two was sent flying toward him. She really hadn't believed that such a thing would ever happen. However, she didn't panic like Four had.\nThe whip around Leonel's arm snaked forward, trying to wrap around him entirely. After all, Two's ability was metal control. Wasn't Leonel looking down on her too much trying to do this?\nTwo snorted as she allowed Leonel to pull her through the air. She could almost see the sight of Leonel being strangled to death by her whip.\nBut, once again… reality was cruel.\nTrying to control metals in the presence of a Morales family heir? That was a bit too naive.\nTwo felt that the loving connection she had always had with metal suddenly disappear, as though it had been cut off by some cruel and callous person.\nBy the time she realized the situation wasn't good, Leonel had already pulled her to within three meters. In fact, his spear was surging toward her forehead without the slightest bit of mercy.\nIt wasn't fair. She had too many other abilities. She still had the needles she always kept around her hips and the armor that always protected her torso. Yet, it all seemed useless. A moment of overconfidence ended her life. Plus… even if she had time, could she control her needles in Leonel's presence? And what use was an armor if his target was her head?\nPCHUU.\nTwo's eyes dulled, staring at Leonel's spear in the same shocked manner Four had.",

      "content": "Leonel landed heavily on the ground, a long breath leaving his lips.\nHis body felt… good. He couldn't explain it with any other words. He just felt free and much better than he had ever before.\nHe sent a glance toward the little mink who would currently lying in a pool of its own blood.\n'Forget it, it can't do anything to me in that state anyway. Consider this payback for all that hell you put me through. Whether you live or die is up to yourself.'\nLeonel shook his head. It seemed he was still a bit too soft. But, he excused himself of this folly by remembering that Simeon was standing right before him. This was a much greater enemy.\nLeonel's gaze turned cold as his eyes met Simeon's through the cracking palace Formation. A hardly concealed animosity flickered within him.\nSimeon frowned. Why did that gaze seem so familiar?\nSuddenly, a tremble coursed through his body. He had seen that cold gaze before. It was a gaze that pissed him off whenever he thought about it.\n\"It's you!\"\nIf it was anyone else, Simeon's words wouldn't have reached him through the volatile Force. But, Leonel heard him just fine. Still… He didn't bother to respond, opting for shooting forward instead.\nSimeon's expression flickered. \"Retreat. Retreat!\"\nOne was an exceptionally tall man. He stood beyond normal human limits, reaching two and a half meters. Yet, instead of seeming slow and lumbering, he had a sharpness to him that made it seem he was the one of normal height whereas everyone else was too short.\nHe always considered himself to be invincible. At the very least, there shouldn't be more than a handful of people on Earth who could match him in strength while those families were still forced to stay in hiding.\nSo, when he heard his Young Lord so decisively order a retreat, he felt dissatisfied. It was like the deaths of Four and Two had little to no impact on him. In his eyes, he could kill the two of them just as easily, if not more so.\n\"Young Lord, let me handle him.\" One said confidently.\nSimeon looked toward One. However, his eyes didn't carry the pleasant surprise One was expecting. Instead, it held a hostile light that made his heart tremble.\n\"This Young Lord ordered you to retreat. So retreat!\"\nOne was stunned. Was the situation truly so bad?\nSimeon couldn't be bothered to care about One's feelings in this moment. One had to remember that the dictionary had broken down Simeon's abilities into two lanes. Genetic Manipulation and.., Reinforced Mind: Mental capacity several times that of normal a individual. Special emphasis on eyesight.\nSimilarly to Leonel, he was able to estimate a person's 'stats' by looking at them. He could immediately grasp that in his current state, there was a high chance that Leonel could suppress and kill One. Though it would take a while, the one commodity he didn't have now was time.\nIn addition, he had noticed the Light Elemental Force that boosted Leonel's speed and the odd Runes that coated his hand when he caught Two's whip. Both were anomalies he had no way to account for.\nAll of this didn't even account for the most important matter… Leonel was standing in this environment without the slightest hint of a Force Skin!\nEverything led to just one conclusion. They were greatly disadvantaged in this place.\nSimeon's heart couldn't help but clench when he thought of a possibility. What if Leonel waited until they approached the Force Eruption to act? Would they even have a chance?\n'Could it be he's an impulsive fool? Or is there another reason he would make such a clear mistake?'\nIf Leonel was just a fool, this was still fine. Such an enemy wasn't one Simeon had to worry about. However, if not…\nSuddenly, Simeon trembled again. He suddenly remembered the disappearance of his two lackies. If Leonel caught them and interrogated them…!\nSimeon turned his gaze toward the little mink corpse and immediately understood everything. However, instead of being relieved that Leonel didn't know how his ability worked, he was instead several levels more apprehensive.\nThis opponent… He had to be killed!\nBoth Simeon and Leonel wanted the death of the other. However, neither had an easy path toward this.\nNot only was Simeon's evaluation of Leonel now several levels higher, but so was Leonel's evaluation of the former. He had never thought that Simeon would be able to so decisively choose to retreat in the face of so many benefits.\nLeonel hadn't missed the subtle look Simeon sent toward the little mink. He immediately guessed that there was a better than 80% probability that Simeon had realized the reason he stepped out so quickly when it would have benefited him more to wait.\nHowever, Leonel had no intention of letting them leave so easily. He wanted Simeon's life even more than the latter wanted his!\nLeonel's body flickered forward, appearing before the cracking palace Formation.\nSeven had only just managed to stabilize the Formation when the Young Lord ordered a retreat. In truth, he had been sighing a breath of relief. He knew he definitely wouldn't make it to the ten minute mark Simeon expected of him.\nBut, at this moment, all his hopes were completely shattered.\nBANG!\nA sharp light pierced through the protective film.\nThe palace Formation crumbled like shattering glass, revealing Seven's figure.\nSeven violently coughed up several mouthfuls of blood. Let alone defend against Leonel's coming attack, he could hardly stand on his own two feet.\nHowever, Simeon had also been prepared. His eight lensed monocle spun around his left eye, complex calculations sweeping by at blinding speeds.\nLeonel's path was immediately blocked by several of the lesser guards Simeon had brought. He had already lost three numbered warriors, he couldn't afford to lose Seven as well.\nSimeon had brought over 30 people with him, each of whom were Force wielders. Though alone they weren't enough to take a single one of Leonel's strikes, together they were enough to obstruct him for several moment.\nLeonel frowned. Should he take it out now?\nNot even an instant later, he shook his head furiously. He couldn't risk using it against humans or else his ending would be no better than Joan's.\n'Dammit… That little mink really screwed me over this time…'\nLeonel's flashing Spear Force reaped three lives in the blink of an eye, but one group had already picked up Seven and rushed one. To make matters worse, Simeon's retreat had been even faster.\nSimeon stood with his hands clasped behind his back. He seemed to be standing on nothing, shuttling through the air like a flying god as he retreated. But, Leonel knew that this was just Six's air solidification ability.\nLeonel's eyes narrowed, but he didn't continue to chase. He knew what kind of support Simeon had outside.\nAt this point, he could only blame the fact Simeon was far more intelligent and cautious than he had given him credit for. Leonel didn't know if even he could retreat so decisively. Simeon had already called for retreat the instant Leonel charged out from the Force geyser.\nThe importance Leonel placed on Simeon rose several levels higher.\nHowever, Leonel didn't feel down. He didn't believe that Simeon would leave this island so easily. He would most definitely surround the hive in a death trap.\nLeonel's lip curled into a sneer. 'While you wait patiently for me, I'll be reaping all of these rewards.'\nWhile Leonel was thinking this, Simeon's line of thinking wasn't much different.\nSimeon's red hair fluttered in the wind, his red eyes piercing through the skies.\n'Why not let you gather up all the benefits for me? I'll just take them off your corpse.'",

      "content": "'He won't be an easy opponent…'\nLeonel flipped his palm, causing a pistol to appear in his hand. As Simeon disappeared through the path toward the valley, he fired off several shots. However, these shots weren't for Simeon at all. Rather, they mowed down several of his subordinates. By the time they disappeared completely, the more than 30 number Simeon had come with had shrunk to barely half of that.\nThough he could see Simeon's furious gaze, Leonel didn't bat an eye. After they truly disappeared, he turned back, entering the Force geyser once again. This time, he didn't hold the Segmented Cube back any longer and directly allowed it to begin speeding up the growth of the Force Crystal Core.\nAfter he came out once again, his first instinct was to begin exploring the other tunnels connected to this mine. The tunnel Simeon went through only led to the valley outside, but the others had a high likelihood of having precious natural treasures.\nHowever, he stopped when he crossed over the bleeding figure of the little mink once more. At this point, he was left speechless.\nWasn't this little guy supposed to be terribly wounded? Why was it that it seemed like it was just taking a nap?\nLeonel shook his head. He couldn't allow anymore variables to occur. So, he coated his hands with Light Elemental Force, scooped up the little mink, and tossed it into one of the Segmented Cube's snowglobes.\nHe really didn't know what to do with that little mink. Maybe in the future when he grew powerful enough to be confident in easily subduing it, he could let it go free.\nAfter dealing with these matters, Leonel's smile returned.\nThere were 12 hours until the Segmented Cube accomplished its task. And, this wasn't necessarily a deadline for him either.\nLeonel grinned. 'Consider this as a bit of payback, old man. Who asked you to bully me for so long?'\nLeonel wouldn't feel the slightest bit bad about robbing the Slayer Legion blind. Old Hutch could only blame himself.\nLeoenl dashed toward the closest tunnel, having stored numerous snowglobes within the spatial bracelet.\nHe followed the tunnel's winding paths, relying on the dictionary to detect precious ores. It wasn't very long before he gained rewards for his efforts.\n'Evolution Ore!'\nUrbe Ore was an important foundational ore and provided the basic network of strength most Force Crafts needed. Evolution Ore worked similarly in that it strengthened ores, but its use was more miraculous.\nDepending on the Ore kind, it could serve all sorts of functions. It could fuse two separate ores to create a new ore sharing both characteristics, it could be applied to a single ore and boost its effects compared to others of its ore family, and it could even be used as a catalyst to speed up ore growth.\nMuch like Urbe Ore, Evolution Ore was one of a kind. There was only one kind of it, but it was separated into many different stages. The Evolution Ore Leonel found was Black Evolution Ore. So, it could provide such effects on any Black Grade Ore and below. In translation, this meant any ore within the Fourth Dimension and below!\nLeonel was happy with this harvest. This vein of Evolution Ore had enough Essence for seven pieces.\n'Essence' was a unique concept that only applied to certain rare natural treasures. It was a method of calculation. Essentially, for an Evolution Ore to achieve its basic effects, it had to have a certain amount of this Essence.\nThe reason why this was important was because of the fourth ability of Evolution Ore. If ten pieces of Black Evolution Ore were fused together, they could form Bronze Evolution Ore! If a hundred pieces of Bronze Evolution Ore were fused together, they could form Silver Evolution Ore!? In order for a piece of ore to count as 'one', it had to have enough Essence.\nThere were very few things that could combine things of lesser quality to form treasures of higher quality, but Evolution Ore was one of them.\n'If I could find more Evolution Ore, just enough Essence for three more, I would be able to use a Fifth Dimension Ore as the foundation for my Divine Armor…'\nLeonel's eyes lit as though they had caught on fire.\nThe two core abilities of his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor were Divine Metal Absorption and Divine Armor Deity. The second was the very reason why the Morales family had evolved to become such good Force Crafters as well as warriors.\nDivine Metal Absorption allowed one who had awakened their Lineage Factor to absorb metals to strengthen themselves. This wasn't a foreign concept. After all, Leonel had been looking for the special Vein Ore [Dimensional Cleanse] mentioned. That Vein Ore would have allowed him to strengthen his Force Pathways.\nHowever, whereas a normal person would only be able to absorb these very special and niche ores, the Morales family wasn't limited by this at all!\nThe special Vein Ore, known as Force Vein Ore, and specifically Black Force Vein Ore for Leonel's current needs, could only be considered normal in strength. The only reason it was so sought after was because its special properties allowed normal Force cultivators to absorb some of its Essence.\nHowever, Leonel could absorb much stronger ores and strengthen his Force Pathways with metals others couldn't even imagine using!\nThis ability was already enough to explain why the Morales family could stand so tall. If someone's body was as strong as metal, was it even possible to harm them? This was completely unlike the A-grade Invalid Leonel had met before because this would also encompass Leonel's inner organs!\nHowever, what was most shocking was that this wasn't the Morales family's only earth shattering ability. It could even be argued that Divine Armor Deity was more exaggerated.\nAs long as one opened the fourth door of the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, it would be possible to absorb metals to strengthen one's self. However, one needed to open the seventh to gain the right to build one's own Divine Armor.\nThis ability could be considered the fusion of a Force Crafter and a warrior's dream. It allowed one to forge one's own Divine Armor and make it a part of one's body. This meant that even without a spatial treasure, one could summon their Divine Armor to protect their body as they pleased.\nWhat made this even more exaggerated than the metal absorption ability was that Divine Armors allowed a Morales family member who had opened the seventh door the power to share abilities with the ores they formed their Divine Armor with.\nIf they absorbed a Wind Elemental Vessel Ore, depending on the quality, they would just as easily gain Wind Elemental Force Strengthening Deviations. The more exaggerated the abilities of the ore, the more powerful the Divine Armor would become!\nOf course, one had to be exceptionally careful with what they chose to make their Divine Armor out of. After all, it was impossible to be a master of all. If one made their Divine Armor a hodgepodge of ores with no clear direction, you'll only end up being a jack of all trades without any sort of real power.\nThe reason Leonel was so excited was because opening the ninth door gave him the right to attempt to absorb and use Quasi Fifth Dimensional metals into his Divine Armor. But, his father had left him behind a note that made his thoughts run wild.\nIf he used Evolution Ore as the core of his Divine Armor, it might be possible for him to form a Fifth Dimensional Divine Armor while his body was still in the Third Dimension. After all, one mustn't forget that Leonel was still currently forming his foundations to enter the Fourth Dimension.\nLeonel's heartbeat quickened.\nThough Divine Armor could easily be discarded and reformed. It was best to pour one's heart and soul into one for each major tier of power. If Leonel managed to have such a good starting position, it wouldn't be necessary for him to discard his Divine Armor until he entered the Fifth Dimension.\nHowever, he was getting ahead of himself. He still needed to design his armor and he still hadn't decided what ores he would use either. Plus, just because he found seven Evolution Ores here, didn't mean he would definitely find another three. Who knew how long it would take?\nThere was one last problem as well. According to his father, this was all just a theory, even he hadn't tried it out yet. He hadn't had the computational abilities to think of it when he was young, and by the time he realized it was feasible, the Evolution Ores he needed for his tier of power were simply too rare.\nWho was to say his old man wasn't screwing him over again?",

      "content": "Leonel carefully put the Evolution Ore away before moving on to the next source the dictionary had detected. If he simply left things as they were, it would probably take decades for the Segmented Cube to naturally form the remaining Essence he needed.\nThough Leonel had no idea whether this was considered a long time or not. He still felt that he didn't want to wait it. So he was already hoping against hope that he would find another deposit of Evolution Ore.\nUnfortunately, reality was cruel. Evolution Ore was an impossibly rare metal, even more rare than Dual Elemental Metals. Finding a single deposit was already enough luck for a lifetime.\nHowever, Leonel wasn't very depressed about this. He was still a poor soul who thought that if he could find it once, he could do it again. But, he had no idea just how long it would take him… If he had, he might have cried a few tears already.\nThe current Leonel though was still ignorant of his current circumstances. His mind was filled with thoughts and designs for his divine armor. But, with every new ore deposit he found, his mind would change again, leaving him in an endless storm of thoughts he couldn't extricate himself from.\nAfter leaving the Evolution Ore deposit, he found three different kinds of Fire Elemental Vessels. One was exceptionally good as the base of short burst treasures, another was good for maintaining high temperatures for an extended period of time, and the last was a combination of the first two, though being weaker in both respects.\nWhen he left those deposits, Leonel found a Wind Elemental Vein Ore not long later and he thought of how cool it might be to combine the two. If he formed a Divine Armor with a fire base and wind veins, its multiplicative power would make up for one of his greatest weakness: his attack power.\nIt was a shame, Leonel had what was likely the strongest ability on Earth, but he was still at a disadvantage purely because his was of the sensory type. Toward this, he could only feel helpless, so he thought it might be a good idea to form a Divine Armor that could make up for this.\nHowever, soon after that Leonel found another Wind Elemental Vessel. Leonel was quite familiar with Wind Elemental Vessels, after all, the first ore deposit he had found after coming here was the Whispering Breeze Ore.\nThis Wind Elemental Vessel was known as Fluttering Leaf Ore. It was exceptionally light to the point it felt as though one was holding on to a piece of foam or a cloud rather than a metal.\nAfter finding it, Leonel immediately had a vision of soaring through skies with wings of metal. Following this, he almost completely abandoned the idea of a Dual Fire-Wind Divine Armor entirely. After all, another one of his weaknesses had always been speed, this was especially so when he fully activated his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor.\nHowever, even this fantasy didn't last for long.\nLeonel found another incredibly rare ore. Though it was also an Elemental Vessel Ore, there were tiers of separation between their rarity and value. Elemental Vessel Ores of the Fire, Wind, Earth and Water variety were the most common. Beyond that, there were what were known as Unique Elemental Vessels, and they included the Lightning Elemental Vessel Leonel had just found.\n'Damn… Lightning is cool too…'\nThis Lightning Elemental Ore was known as Second Strike Lightning Elemental Ore. It was known by this name because it needed a catalyst to activate. Once it did, it would be able to amplify the result with a 'second strike'.\nThis Lightning Elemental Ore was especially beloved by Force users who could be classified as mages like the Mayan Priest. This was especially so for mages who had lightning affinities, Lineage Factors and abilities. This was because such people could use this ore to speed up their thinking and reaction time, allowing them to finish their casting better.\nThere were many other applications to this ore as well, but what Leonel knew was that if he absorbed its properties, due to his Lineage Factor, he wouldn't need to be a lightning affinity mage at all to gain the same benefits.\n'This is no good… Every idea seems better than the last…'\nLeonel could imagine building a lightning Divine Armor with this ore as the base. Not only would he have great offensive power and speed, but it would also be capable of supporting his ability as well. Would giving him even faster thinking speed be like putting wings on a tiger?\nDue to all of these ideas and thoughts, an incredibly weird scene began to form. Leonel, who should have been happy with all of his gains, was suddenly grumbling about as though it was a bad thing for so many ores to appear here. If others knew, they might hate him even more than his Indomitable persona.\nAs Leonel grumbled, he communicated with Little Tolly as they began to melt through another wall.\nLeonel realized that after he awakened his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, his ability to communicate with his Familiar reached a new high. In fact, he found that based on their new and improved synergy, Leonel could replicate the effects of someone with a Grade Designation a sub stage higher.\nThis meant that even without reaching the Superior Grade One Designation, Leonel's skill was actually no less than such a person already. It was no wonder the Morales family chose Metal Spirits as their ideal Familiars.\n\"ROOOOAAARRR!!!\"\nBANG!\nJust as Leonel was lost in his thoughts, thinking of new Divine Armor designs, a loud roar suddenly shook his mind as he was sent flying.\nHe crashed heavily against the opposing tunnel wall, causing all the air to be knocked out of him. If this had been before he awakened, Leonel was certain that he would have broken several bones and even coughed up several mouthfuls of blood from this impact alone.\nHowever, maybe the most shocking thing was that this roar hadn't come from a beast that managed to make its way into the hive… it had come from the wall Leonel had just been excavating…",

      "content": "Leonel heavily crashed into the ground, but his eyes never left that faint light beyond the crack in the wall.\n'Domain Ore!'\nLeonel breathed out a hot breath.\nNormal ores could only contain their special properties within the walls of their bodies. Whether it was Elemental Vein or Vessel Ores, there was no way for them to show off their might outside the actual materials they were formed out of.\nHowever, Domain Ores were different. Not only did they have special properties, but it was also able to project those special properties into the outside world. This manifested as an 'aura' that could send even Leonel flying.\nIn truth, the Runes of the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor also had this effect. Once one opens the ninth door, one would gain the Force Halo Runes. These runes manifested a Domain that asserted an air of dominance. It was due to releasing a bit of that dominance that Leonel could suppress Two's ability. There were also other applications of it like forming a Gravity Domain as well. Though, in Leonel's current state, he wouldn't be able to activate it for long.\nThis Domain Ore Leonel had stumbled upon had roared, sending Leonel flying. There was no doubt it was exceptionally powerful.\nThe highest grade ore Leonel had found to this point was a Tier Seven Black Ore — the Second Strike Ore. Ores like the Evolution Ore and the Urbe Ore were considered unranked.\nThis was already a great boon for Leonel. However, for this ore to be so powerful even through such a small crack… It was at the very least of the Tier Eight Black Grade.\nThe other ores couldn't really harm Leonel. As long as he was careful, with how high his affinity for metals were, he wouldn't receive any backlash. But, clearly, Domain Ores were different. They were among the most dangerous ores to gather.\nLeonel took a deep breath and stood, walking toward the crack again.\nThis time, he released his Lineage Factor fully. He could feel his blood seething as thrown his entire body had been through into a furnace.\nBeautiful bronze Runes appeared across his body, forming a crown on his forehead and soon… even forming a halo above his head.\nGusts of winds kicked up around him as the bright lights of the Domain Ore dimmed. It was as though it sensed a threat looming over it, so it retreated as quickly as it appeared.\nLeonel was quite shocked by this outcome. He had thought it would be more difficult. But, he wasn't complaining. Though he found the violet lights around his body now to be quite beautiful, he didn't think it was out of the norm. At the end of it all, he was still a bit in the dark about such things.\nSoon, the ore was exposed completely, baring its full nature for Leonel.\n'As expected, it's a Soul Type Domain Ore…'\nLeonel shuddered. If his mind hadn't been reinforced by his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor, he would have suffered far more.\nThis Domain Ore was another favorite of mages. Leonel didn't know much about that world, truth be told. All he knew was that this was a top class material for crafting wands and staffs of the like. It could amplify Soul Force attacks.\nLeonel had been correct. This was a Tier Eight Black Grade ore known as Howling Tiger Ore.\n'It's a shame that it's an attack type Soul Domain Ore, or else it would amplify that treasure by several levels…'\nLeonel took a deep breath and carefully put the ore away. He no longer dared to be as absentminded as he was before. And, he also realized now that these gains weren't a joke either.\nIf any of these ores appeared in a knowledgeable world, who knew how many would fight for them? Leonel found it shocking that the Slayer Legion would treat this place so casually. Was it that they didn't know? Or were they that negligent?\nIn the end, Leonel had to admit he had a striking advantage. How many treasures were as good as his dictionary at finding these deposits?\nBut, at the same time, he affirmed to himself to keep these gains a secret. Even though he didn't feel bad stealing from the Slayer Legion like this — after all, he would be saving so many of their young geniuses very soon — there was no need to tell them anything about it.\n'I've spent a lot of time here, the Core should almost be matured… I should head back.'\nUnfortunately, Leonel didn't find anymore Evolution Ores, nor did he find another garden like he had earlier. It seemed that garden was a one off rarity.\nAs Leonel walked back, he clutched a pound of Urbe Ore in his palm. If one looked closely, it was possible to see the greyish black ore losing luster as though something of its was being taken away. Of course, this was Leonel using his absorption ability.\nAccording to his father, to lay the best foundation, he had to first absorb as much Urbe Ore as he could. He wasn't allowed to absorb any other kinds of ores until his body was saturated with Urbe Essence. Only in this way could his body withstand the formation of a powerful Divine Armor.\nLuckily, Leonel had found large deposits of Urbe Ore dotted across this hive. He could even be considered part of the nouveau riche since it was the world's universal currency.\nAs Leonel was on his way back, he casually paid attention to the dictionary. He hadn't expected to actually detect anything. After all, he had already been through this passage once, he was only making his way back. But, unexpectedly, there was actually a reading.\nLeonel raised his brows. 'Are you crapping out on me? Why didn't you detect it the first time…'\nThough Leonel thought this to himself, he still made his way to where the dictionary mentioned. But, oddly enough, the signal disappeared.\n'… Huh? Did it really crap out?'\nLeonel frowned, his Internal Sight blooming forth and blanketing the general direction. But… he sensed nothing.\n'Huh…?'\nAt that moment, Leonel suddenly felt like his Internal Sight had been cut off, as though he lost a portion of himself for a moment. It was an incredibly surreal feeling, as though he was standing in two different worlds at the same time.\nIn that very instant, Leonel understood exactly what it was he had found. He was too intelligent and his foundational knowledge of all things related to Force Crafting was too profound. After all, he didn't want to lose out to his detestable old man.\nIt was another Domain Ore. But, this one… The Howling Tiger Ore couldn't even shine the shoes of…\n'Warping Domain Ore…'\nWarping Domain Ore. It was a Quasi Bronze Grade Ore. However, what truly made it special wasn't its grade, though this alone was enough to make many go crazy. After all, an ore was capable of forming treasures many grades above its own should the Force Crafter be skilled enough.\nNo, the reason this ore was so valuable was because it was of an exceptionally rare family. Just like Howling Tiger Ore was of the Soul Type, Warping Ore was of the Spatial Type!\nWarping Ore had the ability to create an independent space. Its defensive abilities were infuriating. It could make a single step feel like an entire mile.\n'If I combine this into my Divine Armor…'\nLeonel's heartbeat quickened.",

      "content": "Outside the hive, the world could only be described as anarchy. The corpses of beasts filled the islands and oceans, causing the salty winds to carry a grotesque metallic fishy scent with it that made one's heart shudder.\nAs expected, the oceanic creatures had completely lost their minds, rushing for the Project Hunt Island without any sorts of reservations. Unfortunately, many of them were completely unable to do much of anything on land.\nThis truth led to a tragic scene. Many animal carcasses lay near the shore. Large and small fish and once majestic sharks lay dead, rotting in the open air. Beside them, even those creatures that could breathe air like whales, eels and dolphins found themselves without the ability to move on land, leaving them completely stranded.\nHowever, this reality didn't stop them at all. Even now, many were still struggling, madly swinging their tails and fins as they tried to inch just a bit closer to their target.\nThis scene played out all across the island. Most of the creatures fell near the shore, but some managed to travel deeper, causing the dense forests to be littered with corpses.\nAll of this alone was enough to paint the picture of the cruel reality wrought by the Force Eruption, but things further in were even worse than this.\nNot all the beasts were stalled by their immobility. Among them, there were still creatures like crabs, lobsters, frogs and turtles that made their way through. Many of them were freshwater creatures that still somehow managed to make their way to this place, making it all the more obvious just how wide the effects of the Force Eruption had reached.\nBeyond them, there were other creatures who normally wouldn't be able to make it this far who managed to awaken abilities that broke past their usual limitations. This resulted in scenes of fish swimming through the air, unwilling to allow anything to stop them from reaching their destination.\nBut, reality only grew more cruel.\nEven when these creatures managed to pass the initial barrier, they were met by yet another. Many creatures died trying to pass over the valleys. They lacked the intelligence of humans and didn't even consider trying to find another path forward, only believing they had to follow their senses toward the dense surge of Force.\nCorpses began to pile up within the valleys as beast after beasts fell to their deaths, their agonizing screams being the only marks they left on the world in their final moments.\nThis should have been enough. By now, the number that had died touched the tens of thousands. Many of these beasts didn't have great abilities or power, they only came here seeking out a chance and they paid for it with their lives… But things still somehow managed to get worse.\nThere was a small percentage of beasts that did manage to make it through. But, instead of being rewarded for their efforts, they were met by a legion of beasts left behind by Simeon.\nAnother bloody scene was left. How could those beasts compare to the organized assault of the beast kings? They were just a loose pile of sand, sporadically entering the center of the island without a thought other than getting closer to the source of Force.\nEven with the bear king dead and the spider king heavily injured, the beasts were slaughtered one after another. At least… in the beginning.\nThough the beast horde couldn't compare to the beast king legion, what remained true was that there were just too many of them. While each beast king only had a hundred or two under their control, the beasts came in tides of a few hundred each time.\nIf it wasn't for the fact the beast kings only had to defend one direction thanks to the valleys and that most of the beast horde couldn't compare to the beast kings in strength, they would have already been overrun.\nEven then, after a week of this, the spider king finally fell to his injuries. A week after that, it was the tiger king who fell.\nWith each successive death, the protective army grew weaker. The loss of a beast king also meant that their legions would scatter as well, losing their minds just like the horde of beasts that was attacking them.\n\"This is madness.\"\nA familiar young girl stood on the branch of a tall tree outside the center of the island, looking forward as though her eyes could pierce through everything.\nOn the opposite side of the same tree, a familiar young man stood as well, shaking his head.\n\"I knew that a Force Eruption could cause a lot of trouble in a low level world like ours, but I still didn't think it would be this bad…\"\n\"It can't be helped, the beasts haven't fully developed their intelligence yet…\" The girl mumbled.\nThe higher level the world, the rarer and more valuable Force Eruptions were. But, at the same time, it would come with more intelligent beasts who could think and reason just like humans could. In such cases, would they lose their minds like this and charge ahead without thinking of the overall situation? Of course not.\nThat said, that didn't mean high level beasts would ignore such events. In fact, it might even be possible for those high level beasts to take advantage of the less intelligent ones beneath them to clear out all opposition.\nBut still, even in those cases, the scene would be much more controlled.\n\"Should we go? If we let any more of those beast kings fall, it'll be even more difficult to want to get them out of that hive.\" The young man said.\n\"Don't you find it weird that these beasts are just standing there? There has to be a reason that they're the only ones who didn't lose their minds.\"\n\"It might be that one of those Promising Youths has a beast control ability…\"\n\"If they have a beast control ability, why did they run to the hive instead of charging out of the island? With control over that many, it would have been easy. The only logical conclusion is that these beasts are controlled by the Brazinger family people, so we have to be more cautious.\"\nAs though confirming her words, the young lady's eyes narrowed as she noticed a young man wearing an odd monocle walking out from one of the tunnels with his hands clasped behind his back. Just by his red hair and eyes, she could tell that this young man was from that family.\nThe beasts immediately reacted to this young man's appearance, taking defensive stances around him.\nThe young woman sighed. Sometimes she hated being right.\nSuddenly, the situation changed once again. Let alone the two Old Hutch had sent, even Simeon looked up with shock evident in his eyes.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nThe white geyser of Force suddenly concentrated into a fine line. It compressed on itself to the point it became a blinding gold that outshone even the sun hanging high in the skies.\nThen, it exploded, sending a rain of gold in all directions.\nThe raging roars and the bloody battle all suddenly came to an end. In fact, everything, including the young man and woman, Simeon and even the beasts, sat on the ground, closing their eyes in meditation.\nFor those few moments, it felt as though everything in the world was clear to them.",

      "content": "Leonel had no idea how greatly the outside world was benefiting, but there was no need for him to be jealous. As the ones closest to the Force Crystal Core, there was no denying that he, Roaring Black Lion, Thunderous Clap and Flowing Wind were most definitely receiving the greatest benefits.\nIn truth, all four of them, including Leonel, had been caught off guard. But, as though it was instinctual, they all knew exactly what they should do.\nThe maturation of a Force Crystal Mine Core came with a moment of enlightenment. The completion of the natural Force Art required a communication with the most fundamental laws of the universe.\nWhen this gate of communication is opened, not only will the mine itself greatly benefit, but all creatures within its range of influence would as well.\nCompared to others who had sunk into an absentminded enlightenment, Leonel was still able to keep a hold on to his consciousness thanks to his strong spirit. In fact, he was currently struggling, trying to decide what it was he wanted to comprehend.\nShould he use this moment to understand his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor a bit better? Or should he use the chance to calculate the feasibility of forming a Tenth Node? Or maybe he should use this chance to absorb more Urbe Ores? In this state, cultivation should be much faster as well…\nLeonel's mind spun. He even entered his Dream World, splitting into nine clones and thinking in nine different paths. After his spirit gained such a big boost, he was capable of this now. In fact, he had thought he would be capable of far more than this, but it seemed that this was his limit.\nSuddenly, Leonel jolted.\nHis eyes snapped open and he looked toward the Force Crystal Core like a hungry wolf.\nThe Core was shining with beautiful rainbow lights that were tinged with a bit of blackness. This blackness made its Fourth Dimensional Grade very obvious.\nHowever, what Leonel was focusing on wasn't the lights, but rather the complex runes that swarmed its body, exuding a majestic aura.\nLeonel had already felt that natural Force Arts were magical things. Not very much could catch his interest, but this was definitely one of those things.\nIt had taken him two days to Dream Sculpt a mere Third Dimensional natural Force Art. And, though he didn't know what benefits it would bring him in the future, he had a feeling that when he completely grasped it, the possibilities would be unimaginable.\nBut this Natural Force Art was on a completely different level. Not only was it Fourth Dimensional, but it was currently still connected to those enigmatic laws of the universe. If it was during any normal time, Leonel wouldn't dare to try to Dream Sculpt it. Who knew how many years, decades or maybe even centuries it would take him.\nBut right now…\nLeonel's heart steeled as he resolved himself.\nHe knew this was a gamble. If he focused on his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor, he could probably awaken both the Speed and Healing Branch. The benefits of such a thing would not be small by any stretch of the imagination. But…\nHe felt something calling to him.\n**\nDays later, Simeon opened his eyes. Though there was a trace of happiness there, it also carried with it a bit of regret.\nHow could he have expected that the Core would mature so soon? Had he known, he wouldn't have spent hours leaving the hive to prepare for Leonel. What worth did Leonel have to him in the face of such benefits.\nHe could only grind his teeth in anger. Leonel was definitely the closest. This would make things far more complicated now, he was already so powerful to begin with…\nSimeon had always been decisive. Without hesitation, he chose to leave, not even turning back to explain himself to his subordinates. Though One was greatly dissatisfied, so what? One could only wield so much power to begin with thanks to him. If he forgot his place, he could always be replaced.\nLeonel could have never imagined that Simeon would make such a choice. In fact, he even had a shuttle prepared, one not very different to the one used by the weremen who had attack Leonel and Aina.\nBy the time Leonel left the hive, he was stunned to find that Simeon was nowhere to be seen. After deducing the likely reason why, Leonel couldn't help but grow even more serious.\nSimeon had no idea that Leonel's combat prowess hadn't risen at all due to his choice back then, but the fact the former still chose to leave without hesitation caused Leonel to have no choice but to respect him no matter how much he hated him.\nLeonel took a deep breath. 'The bright side is that this makes things much easier. There's nothing that can really stop me from leaving this place.'\nThanks to the Segmented Cube reaching Phase Two, he finally had enough space to hold everybody, so all the youths were with him. Now that Simeon wasn't here any longer, things would be even easier.\nUnfortunately, Simeon left behind the beast kings causing Leonel no small shock. This man really didn't care about the power of the beast kings? Even though there were only three left, they were still all S-grade Elites. Their strength could be considered among the topmost on Earth…\nWhat Leonel didn't know was that these beasts were only the overlord of this B Sector Project Hunt Island… However, even without knowing this, Leonel added yet another point to Simeon. If things kept going like this, he might as well call that bastard master the next time they met.\nJust when Leonel was about to resolve himself to charge through these beasts, his eyes suddenly narrowed in a certain direction.\n'Huh? He noticed me from this far away?'\nThe young woman was stunned. It had to be said that they were at least 20 kilometers away. The only reason she could see so far wasn't due to her ability, but rather because of a Force technique she practiced. But, she didn't sense Leonel circulating any Force, so how had he done it…?\n\"Bring us over there, Badger.\"\n\"Over there? You can't mean you want me to fly, right? That's dangerous.\"\n\"Idiot, all the flying beasts descended from the skies after the Core matured. It's safe to go up there now. In fact, if we don't do it quickly and their enlightenment ends, it'll be even more difficult to leave this place.\"\n\"Alright, alright, alright.\"\nBadger took a dignified step forward, wings bursting from his back.\nThey radiated a majestic silver light. But, what was the most striking about them was their size. Each dwarfed their owner, spanning over five meters in each direction.\nTo his back, one could faintly catch the divinity of a Roc.",

      "content": "Leonel obseved the young man and woman who landed before him with a slightly curious gaze.\nFrom the way they called each other, he knew that the young man went by the name Badger. He had a simple look to him as though he never spared any thoughts toward scheming. His skin was a delicate brown color and his clothing was neat and tidy to the point of being overly meticulous. How he managed to look so fresh even when flying through the air at such blinding speeds was beyond Leonel's comprehension.\nCompared to his unkempt beard and nest of straws he called hair, this young man was several levels his better. Though, actually, now that he thought about it, his hair had become exceptionally smooth and clean after awakening his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor. Not that he checked very closely, though.\nThe woman went by the name Mayfly. She had a tall, heroic build. Even compared to Leonel, she was almost tall enough to be at eye level with him, just barely falling short. She seemed like a born leader with a sharp mind.\nHer hair was red, which initially made Leonel on guard against her as he assumed she might also be from the Brazinger family. But, after some more observation, he deduced that it was unlikely.\nThe two seemed like quite the pair, especially by the way they had made their way over. Badger actually allowed Mayfly to step on his shoulders as he flew. Leonel really didn't know how to react to such a sight. But, since Badger didn't mind, it wasn't really his place to say anything.\n\"You two were sent by Old Hutch?\"\nBadger and Mayfly looked quite stunned when they heard these words. Not many dared to call the old man by his nickname, least of all those under his command. The two of them were among the few who felt no fear before the geezer. They were surprised to find that Leonel was just as unreserved.\n\"Yes, we were sent for an attempted rescue, but it seems it wasn't necessary…\" Mayfly said with a slightly confused tinge in her voice. \"… Where are the others, it can't be that…?\"\nShe was a bit worried to ask this question. But, she had no choice. Leonel had come out alone, so she braced herself for the worst.\n\"They're all with me. They're in an abode treasure of mine.\"\nOnce again, the two youths were shocked. But after a moment, they 'understood'. It must be that there were too few of them remaining, so they could all fit in such a treasure. They couldn't fathom the idea of nearly a hundred people fitting into just one space.\nOne had to know that spatial treasures were already inconceivably valuable. The higher the Dimensional Grade, the more valuable they were. This was because spatial treasures of a lower Dimensional grade entering a higher Dimensional world would destabilize and collapse.\nIf Leonel tried to take his Black Grade spatial bracelet to a Fifth Dimensional world, the already small space would break apart and eject everything within it. In severe cases, it might even destroy everything inside before it could eject it.\nSo, one really shouldn't blame the two for assuming the worst.\nHowever, the two were soon baffled.\nAfter a few hours, the trio managed to battle their way out of the encirclement of beasts. In fact, the only beast king that survived was the skeleton monkey king. Not only were they astonished by Leonel's battle prowess, but when they returned to the ships docked off shore, they were even more stunned as they watched Leonel bring out over 80 youths from his abode treasure.\nSuch a treasure really existed… They could hardly believe it.\nAt that moment, the Commanders of both the Southern and Eastern Lookouts listened to the stories of the youths. When they learned just how much they owed their survival to Leonel, they couldn't help but look toward the young man with fond gazes.\n\"Indomitable, this time you were too reckless. You can't just expose your face like this.\"\nViolet Rain reprimanded Leonel harshly. But, somehow, she sounded more like a big sister admonishing her little brother. Plus… she couldn't wipe the smile off her face, so her attempts at looking stern fell flat.\nShe couldn't hide her happiness at all. She had been so worried about these kids.\nIt couldn't be said that things were perfect. Of the 87 youths sent, only 81 returned. Leonel wasn't a superhuman. Though he protected the youths to the best of his abilities when they charged toward the hive, there were some inevitable losses.\nBut, even this was already far beyond what the Commanders expected. Even just half surviving would have been a miracle to them.\n\"Alright, alright. That's enough, Violet Rain.\"\nA hearty laughter came from the side of the Eastern Lookout Commanders. It seemed that unlike how the youths had rivalries, the Commanders of the various Lookouts weren't like this at all.\nThe laughter came from a jovial looking man with a massive gut. Somehow, despite his apparently unhealthy wait, he looked quite fit though his bald head was especially eye catching.\nHe went by the alias Big Buddha.\n\"On behalf of the Eastern Lookout, I really thank you, Indomitable. If it wasn't for you, I really worry how this would have ended.\"\nLeonel smiled, feeling the good will of this man.\nThe atmosphere was jovial as everyone felt as though a big weight had been taken off of their shoulders. Maybe the only person who had a disatisfied expression was Pisces. Even King of Seas carried the happiness of a man who had just survived a near death experience. After Leonel snubbed Pisces, he wasn't nearly as stand offish with him. In fact, he quite appreciated Leonel. Humans were truly odd creatures.\nEveryone seemed to understand why Pisces was brooding, so no one bothered her so as not to affect the happy atmosphere.\nEventually, it was time to go their separate ways.\nBig Buddha's laughter sounded out again as he bid his farewells.\n\"I'll see you soon Big Sis Violet Rain. The opening of the Zone isn't too far away, I'll be leading these brats when the time comes.\"\nViolet Rain smiled and waved them off.\nThe two ships that had been attached by a bridge slowly separated, wading through the piles of corpses on the ocean's surface to sail toward their destinations.\nPisces sent hateful glares toward Leonel, but the latter didn't seem to notice.\nNot only had she not received the S-grade Beast Crystal, but she also knew that she hadn't qualified to enter the SS-grade Zone. According to the tallies, it was Leonel, Flowing Wind and Thunderous Clap who ranked first, second and third respectively.\nShe didn't know what to do with her belly full of hatred. She wasn't strong enough to oppose Leonel. And, with how much he had contributed to the Slayer Legion, he would probably be promoted to at least a Vice Commander.\nShe stood on the ship's helm, shaking her head. Maybe she should just forget it.\nAt that moment, she heard Big Buddha's jovial laughter again. Initially, it annoyed her. Why was everyone acting so happy when she was so unhappy?\nSuddenly she froze. After a moment of thought, a smile curled her lips.\n\"Commander Buddha, can I talk to you for a moment? I have some questions about a Force technique I'd like to ask you.\"\n\"Oh?\" Big Buddha, who had been conversing with the other Commanders smiled gently. He didn't mind guiding the younger generation at all. \"Sure, sure. We have a lot of time before we reach the Lookout.\"\nPisces' actions didn't raise any sort of suspicion. Such a thing was quite normal. However, when she began to speak, Big Buddha's expression continuously changed before it became exceptionally solemn.\n\"Are you certain? You're saying that it can deduce the abilities of people and creatures, not to mention their weaknesses, with a single scan?\"\n\"Yes, Commander. It isn't only me who saw this, there are many witnesses, you can ask anyone.\"\nBig Buddha fell into silence. He felt exceptionally conflicted. On one hand, he didn't like what Pisces was implying by telling him this information. But, on the other, such a treasure was unheard of. So unheard of, in fact, that even though he hadn't shown any greed toward Leonel's rare abode treasure, the moment Pisces spoke of this...\nIt was too valuable to the Slayer Legion. The value of such a treasure was unimaginable…\nBut this wasn't the only important point… It was said that the first four to clear a Zone received special rewards. This was because the World Spirit was taken by another person many decades earlier.\nThe Slayer Legion already knew of who was second, third and fourth. However… not a single person in the world was aware of who was first…",

      "content": "A week came and went in the blink of an eye.\nThe SS-grade Zone found by the Slayer Legion was under strict protection. While the clearing of Zones was important to the evolution of Earth, they also provided boundless prospects. The rewards for clearing such a Zone was beyond the imaginations of most.\nIn truth, one shouldn't take Leonel as the standard. To most, C-grade treasures were a luxury. They were already enough for many to fight over. The only reason the base weapon given by the Slayer Legion during the Gathering was of the C-grade was because the Promising Youths were also considered elites among elites.\nAbove that, B-grade treasures were practically national blessings while A-grade treasures and above were enough to start fueds over. From this, it could be said that Big Buddha had truly shown a lot of restraint when Leonel's abode treasure was exposed.\nKnowing all of this, one could imagine the kind of uproar an SS-grade treasure could cause. The fact that this was a Sub-Dimensional Zone with a 12 entry limit meant that at a minimum, 12 treasures were available for the taking. Even to the Slayer Legion, this was a great level of wealth.\nThe location was yet another island. The Zone itself stood quite beautiful, radiating dark blue lights as it swirled silently amidst a large clearing. It could easily be told that this clearing hadn't been here in the past. In all likelihood, when the Zone appeared, it had ripped out several trees in the surroundings. But now, it had a calmness that said it wouldn't harm even a fly — though, no one would be naive enough to believe such a thing.\nThe Slayer Legion had long since erected a network of Force Disruption Towers in the vicinity. Like this, the appearance of this Zone didn't cause another beast horde and allowed the island to remain peaceful.\nAt that moment, the entry candidates for the Slayer Legion were undergoing final check ups. Leonel could only sigh as his treasures were taken inventory of one after another. It really felt like he had never left The Empire. He wouldn't be surprised if the Slayer Legion tried to 'buy' his rewards after he exited as well.\n'Whatever, it doesn't matter. It was they who found the Zone so I guess it's fine if they take some benefits. All I want is the teleportation ticket to Terrain. If they dare to take this away, I wouldn't mind falling out with the Slayer Legion.'\nThough Leonel would feel a bit bad for Old Hutch, he hadn't known the old man for long, nor had the old man ever really done anything for him. In fact, it was the old man who owed him for kidnapping him all those weeks ago.\nIt wasn't his fault if the Slayer Legion thought of him as one of their own. He had said multiple times that he had no intentions of joining. If they really tried to think that they could just order him around as they pleased, they would be in for a rude awakening.\n\"Alright, I'm sure you all know about the rules. The Slayer Legion has a list of treasure types it's especially in need of. As long as you can claim one of these treasures for the Legion, you will be awarded the aforementioned merit points.\n\"Violet Rain and Big Buddha will be the leaders of this mission. Their commands are undeniable. Should they disagree, the decision will be left to a majority vote.\n\"Should anything happen to the both of them, commanding rights will fall to Badger, Mayfly, Mountain and Sea Eel. The same rules apply to them as well.\"\nLeonel sent a casual glance toward Mountain and Sea Eel. It seemed that their standing within the Slayer Legion didn't lose out to Badger and Mayfly at all, it was just that they were from the Eastern Lookout instead and as such, were under the jurisdiction of Supreme Monet rather than Supreme Hutch.\nIf the four of them weren't so young, it was likely that they would have already been promoted to the Star General ranks. But, instead, they held a special title reserved for the most talented youths of the Slayer Legion. They were part of what was called the Reserve Generals.\nAccording to the old man, as long as they turned 21, they would immediately be promoted to One Star General, a rank a single step above the Commander rank.\nLeonel shook his head. He wasn't interested in such a thing.\nThe Slayer Legion had disappointed him too many times already. It seemed that they made even more mistakes than he did at every turn. So, even though he found out that their true talents were hidden away from public view, he hadn't really changed his opinion of them.\nAs things stood now, he didn't have a fond impression of either The Empire or the Slayer Legion. He wasn't sure what to do with these emotions for now, and he was even more uncertain of his future on Earth as a result of these emotions, but he simply chose to ignore them for now.\nHe only had two goals in mind: Find Aina and destroy the Royal Blue Fort. He was a simple man who wanted simple things.\nIf others knew he was describing such things as simple… who knew how they would react?\nJust as Leonel was lost in his thoughts, he sensed a change in the atmosphere. When he looked over, he found that the change was due to the appearance of a person he had never seen before.\nShe was a middle-aged woman who carried a mature valiant aura that outshone Mayfly by several levels. It was clear that she had tempered her disposition over many years, giving her an innate advantage over a young woman of not even 18 years old like Mayfly.\nShe wore a silver chestplate with etchings of a spiraling phoenix on it. Her long black her swayed to her waste, waving in the wind and along with her every step.\nDespite her clearly being in her 40's, she still had an intoxicating beauty. Though, it was difficult to tell whether or not their attraction to her was due to her demeanor or her actual looks. Even Leonel, who usually showed no reaction to women other than Aina, couldn't help but be moved. This woman was truly something…\nWhile Leonel was distracted, he didn't notice Big Buddha's complicated gaze sweep over him. In the end, the large Commander shook his head an sighed. Compared to his own discomfort, his loyalty toward the Slayer Legion was several levels more important.\nLeonel didn't know who this woman was, but how could he not? This was none other than Supreme Monet.\nBig Buddha had long since passed down all the information he gained from Pisces on to her and left the final decision to his Supreme. As a Commander, he normally wouldn't even be allowed to meet such a high ranking officer, but this time, he had had no choice but to do everything he could to see her, and he eventually succeeded.\nBut, for some reason, she hadn't made any movements in the last week, so he thought that she had decided not to make a move against the young man. This had made Big Buddha sigh a breath of relief, at least now, he wouldn't have to fight with his own conscience.\nUnfortunately… It seemed that rather than not acting, his Supreme had actually been waiting for an opportune moment.\n\"Who is Leonel Morales?\"\nSupreme Monet's voice was just as valiant as her appearance, making one inadvertently want to follow her every command.\nLeonel frowned, wondering why this woman was looking for him. Even more oddly, why was she saying his name like this? In the end, he chose not to mind it. After all, he had already long since exposed himself. So, who cared if she used his name?\n\"That would be me.\" Leonel stepped forward.\nSupreme Monet looked Leonel up and down before nodding.\n\"The treasure you call a dictionary, are you willing to hand it over to the Slayer Legion or not?\"\nLeonel's eyes narrowed. Why did it seem like she wasn't asking a question at all?",

      "content": "Leonel observed Supreme Monet for a long while. He didn't seem to be in any sort of rush to answer, a response that was quite shocking to many.\nIf others were in his situation, there would be one of two reactions. The first would be to immediately agree. After all, the authority of a Supreme wasn't something most were able to ignore.\nThe second option would be to explode in anger. There was no shortage of people who thought Monet's actions were excessive. In fact, those who knew how the relationships of the top echelon worked felt even more pity for Leonel.\nKnowing that Leonel had Hutch's backing, it was only a matter of course that Monet would wait until this moment to ask this of Leonel. If she went to the Eastern Lookout to ask such a question, Old Hutch probably would have sent her packing.\nFor that madman, it wasn't even a matter of whether or not Monet's ask was appropriate or not, it was entirely about his own face.\nHowever, Leonel's response was exactly the last thing they could have expected. Aside from a slight frown in the beginning, he hardly reacted to the words at all. In fact, even Monet herself frowned slightly seeing Leonel's response. She had been prepared for either of the two obvious responses, but this wasn't something she had been ready for.\nTo make matters worse, it seemed that this young man wasn't intimidated by her gaze or presence. He calmly scanned her up and down as though he was observing any other normal stranger he was meeting for the first time.\nEventually, just when the silence was beginning to weigh too heavily on everyone's chest, Leonel finally spoke.\n\"Sorry. The dictionary was left to me by my father. Giving it to another is impossible. I appreciate your asking first, though.\"\nThere didn't seem to be anything wrong with Leonel's response. Monet asked a question and he responded appropriately. So, why did they feel so embarrassed?\nMonet narrowed her eyes slightly.\nSeeing that the situation was turning bad, Big Buddha who had guilt eating at his heart this whole time, couldn't help but step forward to try to mediate.\n\"Leonel, Supreme Monet is only thinking about the bigger picture. Your treasure is too valuable. If it fell into the hands of The Empire, it could lead to a catastrophe. But, if it was in our hands, the chance we'd have to overturn their oppressive rule would skyrocket.\"\nAt this point, Violet Rain who had been shocked by the sudden change the situation suddenly felt she understood something after hearing Big Buddha's words. Once she did, she couldn't help but turn a disappointed glance toward her long time friend.\nLeonel swept a glance over Big Buddha.\n\"Oh.\" Leonel nodded. However, just when Big Buddha and the others wanted to sigh a breath of relief, thinking that Leonel understood, his next words caused them to freeze. \"But, I honestly don't see much of a difference between you all and The Empire though. I can't tell that there would be a difference in outcome no matter who gets their hands on it.\"\nIn the beginning, Big Buddha was shocked by what he was hearing. It wasn't just them, everyone here was shocked. They all saw themselves as a righteous faction fighting for the people. When had someone ever said such words to them?\nFirst there was shock, then there was rage. Big Buddha's guilt seemed to completely vanish. At the same time, even Badger and Mayfly who had had a good impression of Leonel frowned deeply toward his words. Such a reaction didn't change even when Flowing Wind and Thunderous Clap were taken into consideration.\nThis could be expected. These youths were indoctrinated by the Slayer Legion since their birth. And, those who hadn't had parents and relatives who suffered at the hands of The Empire. Leonel's words were like a slap to their faces.\nHowever, Leonel felt that he had observed the Slayer Legion for long enough to feel quite confident about his words. He really didn't feel that there was a difference at all.\nAt this point, Leonel didn't really care what happened. The Zone was right in front of him. He didn't believe that anyone here could stop him from entering it. It was too close and his power was too great.\nThis wasn't a case of the strong oppressing the weak. Earth's Metamorphosis just began. Most people started at the same starting line. Even though Monet was more than double his age, it didn't make a difference.\nEven though Leonel still wasn't confident in defeating Old Hutch, he didn't believe that the old man could stop him if he was here either. As long as he was one of the first 12 to enter, nothing else mattered to him.\n\"Young man…\"\nBig Buddha's voice no longer seemed as amiable, but Leonel had already long since stopped paying attention. The only reason he hadn't moved to enter the Zone yet was because he wanted to know how this would end. Would Monet make a move against him before he entered? In that case, he would go all out now. But, if she chose to wait, Leonel didn't mind keeping a shred of pretenses intact for a while longer.\n\"Leonel Morales, is it…?\"\nLeonel was speechless. She had already asked his name, why is it that she was pretending not to know what it was now as though she already couldn't be bothered to remember?\nToward such a woman, Leonel really had nothing to say. He couldn't even be bothered to have a back and forth with these people anymore.\n\"From my understanding, you aren't a formal member of our Slayer Legion. I accept your decision, but there also doesn't seem to be an appropriate reason to allow you to enter our Zone either. —\"\nIt seemed like Monet wanted to say more, probably an entire spiel on why she was morally correct. However, Leonel wasn't joking around when he decided he really couldn't be bothered to listen anymore.\n\"What's her ability?\"\nLeonel's voice left them stunned. It became clear in a moment that he really wasn't bothering to listen to their Supreme anymore.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Generating nomenclature… ]\n[ Evolution Stage: Tier 8 Black ]\n[ Evolution Type: Dual Elemental Healing ]\n[ Evolution: Fire Sense, Fire Manipulation, Fire Aid ]\n[ Fire Sense: Greater affinity for Fire Elemental Force. 200% boost in comprehension and power in using fire based Force Techniques.? ]\n[ Fire Manipulation: Control over the Fire Element. ]\n[ Fire Aid: Ability to absorb the Fire Element to regain stamina and heal wounds. ]\nWhen Monet heard these words, her pupils constricted. But, at the same time, she felt a rage bubbling in her heart. For Leonel to cut her off to ask this question, wasn't his intent obvious?\nAt that moment, everyone suddenly went on guard against Leonel. However, it wasn't to the point they worried for their lives. There were too many elites here. If Leonel really wanted to do something, he would only be courting death. It was very possible that he wouldn't even be allowed to leave this place alive. As a Supreme, Monet had more than enough rights to kill someone on the spot.\nHowever, what left them speechless was that Leonel didn't even stop. As though he didn't have a care in the world, he had the dictionary expose their abilities one after another.\nToward such a thing, Leonel was quite helpless. The fact he had to speak aloud to get this information was the worst drawback of the dictionary. Unfortunately, there was no way Monet would allow him to continue on so casually.\nBut, none of them could have expected that even before anyone could make a move, the situation would change once more.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\n\"HAHA! We really have to thank the Slayer Legion this time. Finding an SS-grade Zone couldn't have been easy.\"",

      "content": "At that moment, there was movement in the skies above.\nIn order to hide this place from prying eyes, the island had been covered in dense clouds. In fact, it wasn't just the island, but the surrounding tens of miles as well. With a single glance, even someone who wasn't quite informed could tell that these clouds couldn't have possibly formed naturally. It was obvious to Leonel that this was related to someone's ability.\nThanks to this, the island had been shrouded in a perpetual darkness even though it was midday. Maybe it was in part due to this that the atmosphere from earlier felt so oppressive.\nThat said, the clouds served no other purpose aside from concealment. They didn't seem to have any offensive or defensive ability, so when the uninvited guests descended from above in a silver ship, the clouds were completely unable to stop their descent.\nThe clouds moved aside and quickly reformed, revealing a small boat of about five meters in length. Its deck carried six people.\nThe man who had spoken earlier stood at the help and looked to be about the same age as Monet. However, to his back, there were five youths no older than Leonel or Mayfly.\nSeeing these people appear, an ugly expression took hold of Monet's once calm visage. It was very obvious that she knew who these people were.\n\"You.\"\nSuddenly, Monet sent a rage fueled gaze toward Leonel, leaving him speechless once again. He also didn't know who the hell these people were, why was he being looked at like it was his fault they had appeared.\nHowever, after a while, Leonel sneered inwardly. To Monet, it didn't matter if he was responsible or not. All she had to do was pretend like he was. In such a way, she had even more reason to apprehend him. In fact, before, it could be said that her actions were still questionable. But now, even Old Hutch wouldn't be able to say anything.\n'What a conniving woman.'\nHowever, Leonel still didn't have much of a reaction to this. His mind was running through several calculations. To him, the appearance of a third party was actually an excellent turn of events.\nThere was, of course, a small chance that this could make things worse for him. This was in the case the two opposing parties decided to work together. But, judging by the situation, that seemed unlikely.\n\"There's no need to react this way, Monet. We can do this the easy way. Just give up six entry slots and everything will be fine. If not, we can always do things the hard way.\"\nIn truth, the man who stood at the helm of the silver boat hadn't expected a Supreme to be here today. He had come as a precautionary measure so that these youths didn't lose their lives. Plus, with him here, bullying those Commander rank folks below would be as easy as breathing.\nIf it wasn't for the fact she had suddenly shown up, he wouldn't even bother to speak at all, he would have directly swooped in. In fact, it was an act of giving face that he only brought a total of six including himself. This way, the backlash from the Slayer Legion wouldn't be too exaggerated.\nBut, if he had known a Supreme would be here, he would have definitely brought more people. Not so that they could enter, but so that they would have a stronger hand for negotiations.\nWhat the man could have never expected was that an esteemed Supreme would come here for the sake of a boy of not even 20 years of age.\n\"Impossible.\" Monet took a hard stance. \"Scram back to where you came from. Your Adurna family isn't welcome here.\"\nLeonel cocked an eyebrow. 'Adurna family? Is that another hidden family…?'\nSeeing how they all had blue hair and eyes, Leonel felt that this was very likely the case. At the same time, he was speechless as well. What was with all these families having the same eye and hair colors? It can't be that they were… inbreeding, right?\nLeonel shuddered.\n\"I see… It seems that this is the way you want to do thin —\"\nSHUUU!\nAt that moment, something not a single person expected to happen occurred. Leonel, without saying a word to anyone, suddenly dashed forward. His speed was so fast that sounds of the wind splitting apart followed his figure.\nLet alone Monet, even the man from the Adurna family was stunned. No one had expected such a thing.\nThis child's guts… weren't they too large?\n\"You dare?!\"\n\"Hold it right there!\"\n\"Boy!\"\nThe last roar was from Big Buddha himself. It could be said of those the most offended by Leonel's comments, he could rank at the very top. His loyalty to the Slayer Legion was far beyond anything Leonel could imagine. After all, as a person who had never truly had an undying passion in his life, how could Leonel understand this man?\nBecause of this, even when the Adurna family appeared, Big Buddha's rage had still been focused on Leonel. It was just that the boy had completely ignored him. But, as a result, Big Buddha was the first to notice Leonel's actions and was also the first to react.\nThe path forward wasn't exactly easy. The surrounding 100 meter space of the Zone had been completely cleared out. Outside of this radius, there were many crew members of the Slayer Legion tasked with maintaining the Force Disruption Towers.\nCompared to those people, Leonel could be considered to be in the middle. Many were behind him, but many were also in front of him. And, of those ahead of him, there were a few who had either passed the inspection before him or had special privileges and as such, had no need to go through such procedures.\nHowever, despite seeing these obstacles before him, Leonel's heart was calm. His actions seemed foolish, but this kind of chaos was exactly what he needed.\nAs expected, as soon as Leonel charged toward the Zone gate, the leading man of the Adurna family suddenly narrowed his gaze. He had already decided. So long as Leonel reached a certain level of closeness, he too would rush in.\nEveryone knew how Zones worked. The moment one entered, the gate would begin to close. If no others entered in time, the Zone would close. This meant that everyone would be on a timer the instant the first person entered…",

      "content": "Leonel didn't seem to hear the words of those around him. He continued to charge forward, his blazing speed leaving a trail of gold in his wake.\nHe had already formed his Eighth Node in the past week. Even though there were Force Disrupting Towers around, Earth's technology hadn't advanced to the point of being able to block Force Strengthening Deviations just yet. As a result… Who here could match him in speed?\nBig Buddha was completely enraged after being ignored by Leonel. But, why should he have expected anything else? Was Leonel going to stop just because he shouted out a few time.\nA cold light flashed in Leonel's eyes when he saw that Big Buddha was blocking his way.\nRage lit the large man's eyes. In that moment, his palms were covered by a formless energy that soon coalesced into illusory hands that dwarfed even his body in size. It was clear that the usually amiable Big Buddha was truly enraged this time. If not for this, there was no way that he would pour so much energy into his ability.\nHowever, what infuriated him even more was that Leonel obviously had no intention of engaging with him. What a joke. Why would he allow himself to be stalled in this way? Plus… how could such a big man match him in agility?\nLeonel planted his foot down hard, feinting to one side and bursting with speed to another. He was Leonel Morales, a king of the football field. Compared to fighting, these sort of evasive movements were things he was even better at.\nBig Buddha could hardly react when he found that Leonel had already burst by him, heading for the clearing around the Zone without pausing for even a moment.\nAt that point, Monet finally reacted. Though she had yelled out initially, it still took her a while to realize that something like this was actually happening. A boy of not even 20 years of age was actually impugning on her authority in such a way? How could she stand for it?\nHowever, she was too far from Leonel. She had been speaking to him from on high before, she didn't believe she needed to approach such an ant so closely. So, compared to Big Buddha, she was at least 50 meters away from Leonel. In fact, after he broke out into a run, it was already closer to a hundred.\n\"Stop him by any means.\" She shouted out an order coldly.\nBadger sighed. Of the Reserve Generals, his speed was unmatched. Even after seeing Leonel's burst, he found that it was still beneath his own. After all, his Lineage Factor boosted speed much like Aina's boosted strength. In addition, his ability supplemented his Lineage Factor as well, giving him the wings of a Roc. For him, blocking Leonel's path was truly not a problem.\nIt was just a shame. He had had a good impression of Leonel. But, after what he said about them and The Empire, all of those good feelings had gone out of the window. If it wasn't for the fact he had fought with Leonel side by side, rather than just blocking his path, he would have directly killed him.\n\"Let me.\" He said coolly.\nHearing his words, the remaining three Reserve Generals nodded. They could see that no one else could pause Leonel's steps. As long as he was stalled, this matter would be over. Since Badger had the greatest speed amongst them, it was only natural that he would go. In fact, they even cleared out his general vicinity.\nBadger fell forward, his leg stomping forth just when it seemed he might hit the ground face first. If one looked closely, it really seemed as though his thigh might burst from his pants at any time. The amount of power in his legs was already inconceivable. But then… his wings appeared.\nBANG!\nThe grass beneath his feet was completely flattened. In the distance, trees that managed to survive the appearance of the Zone swayed wildly, their green leaves being ripped from their branches.\nMonet smiled lightly, though it seemed to be more of a sneer. Badger was like a streak of silver, his speed crossing 150 kilometers an hour with ease. It seemed that he would catch up with Leonel in just a few breaths.\nBut, that was when Leonel sighed a sigh none of them could here. Beneath the raging winds… how could they?\n\"Too predictable…\" He mumbled beneath his breath.\nThe speed of the Light Element wasn't a joke. The only issue was that while Leonel had other attributes and abilities that stunted his speed, Badger was quite literally built to maximize his speed.\nHis bones were as light as that of a birds. His wings had a massive ratio in comparison to his body. He had also learned several agility Force techniques. And, as if that wasn't enough, he had a speed type Lineage Factor. Compared to Leonel who had still yet to awaken the speed branch of his Snowy Star Owl, he was indeed a bit faster.\nHowever… how could Leonel not know that? In fact, he had purposely not accelerated with his greatest speed to make sure this would play out in this way. It was too obvious that the one they'd send to stop him would be Badger.\nAnd, unfortunately for them, Badger had weaknesses just like Leonel.\nLeonel kept running as though he believed he could out pace Badger. But, this only made the others grow more confident. In fact, Monet had already begun to move. She only wanted Badger to stall Leonel, as for completely restraining him, it might very well take more than a single person.\nThe other Reserve Generals seemed to know this as well. So, after they finished clearing out a path for Badger, they too shot forward.\nIn the sky, the leading man of the Adurna family raised an eyebrow. He too felt that Leonel was finished. However, he was a bit unwilling. How could he gain some benefits from this situation...?\n'in that case…'\n\"Little Nana, help out our friends a bit.\"\nAt that time, the youngest of the Adurna family blinked her large watery eyes and took a step forward. She extended a slender finger down below and spoke in a clear, resounding voice.\n\"Bind.\"\nLeonel suddenly felt a formless pressure surround his body, causing his steps to falter. His expression changed. It felt as though he was trying to run in quick sand.\nThe innocent little girl in the skies blinked her eyes. Leonel had no idea that she was shocked that he could still run at all.\nShe extended her finger again. \"Double Bind.\"\nLeonel felt his legs snap together as though a rope had tightened around his ankles. Without suspense, he fell to the ground helplessly.\nThe leading man of the Adurna family laughed.. \"Don't say I've never helped you with anything, Monet. I think this is enough to exchange for six places, no? I hear this boy has something quite valuable to you?\"",

      "content": "Though others were likely making their own assumptions about Leonel's current state of mind, the man himself was incomparably calm as he watched the ground quickly approach him. Falling like this truly wasn't pleasant.\nLeonel had already calculated that the chance of this happening was quite high. In order to lure Badger in, he lowered his speed. As a result, the Adurna family would obviously think that he would fail. If that happened, there was a 76% chance they would act direclty against him as a show of goodwill toward the Slayer Legion, thus making their subsequent asks more palatable.\nThis was simply how the world of the upper echelons worked, a complex network of meaningless pleasantries, fake smiles, and most important of all: debts.\nIt could only be said that Leonel was unlucky. Though he had known they would try to stop him, the odds of them having such a perfect ability to do so was relatively low. He was definitely getting screwed over by the luck gods. But, even then, he didn't panic.\nJust when it seemed he would fall face first, he rolled his left shoulder forward and performed a somersault. The instant his two feet hit the ground, still binded together, he lowered himself into a strong squat and leapt forward.\nWith his current strength, such an action easily sent him over ten meters into the air, falling in a not so elegant parabola shape. However, it was unquestionable that his speed had fallen. In fact, Badger was already not much more than 15 meters from him.\nLeonel sent a casual glance toward the leading man of the Adurna family. The man couldn't help but frown when he saw Leonel's calm countenance. It felt as though Leonel could see right through him, as though he was analyzing and memorizing every little detail. It didn't seem like a cold gaze for the sake of being cold, but the kind of indifferent glance one would give a sheet filled with numbers.\nWithout suspense, Badger caught up to Leonel just as the latter hit the ground once more. He didn't speak any words, but the derision in his eyes were cleared.\nToward such disdain, Leonel could only shrug. If such simple words made them so infuriated, it only meant that the Slayer Legion was even worse off than he thought.\n\"Double Bind.\"\nThe little girl stretched her fingers out again. This time, Leonel's wrists snapped together, causing his frown to deepen.\nHe had already entered the clearing and was just 50 meters away from the Zone. But at this point, it might as well be a miles away. How infuriating.\nThe little girl's ability was truly astounding. Leonel believe that it was Tier 8 at worst.\nIf it was just as simple as binding him with something material, Leonel wouldn't take it so seriously. But, what was shocking was that this binding seemed more… mytserious than that. Almost as if the laws of physics around him had changed to make it so that his ankles and wrists were only allowed to be together. Should they be apart, it would be breaking the regulations of the laws around him.\nAt any other time, Leonel would be greatly fascinated by this. Such a concept was completely novel to him and he wondered if it was possible to apply to his Force Crafts. But, at the moment, he didn't have such a luxury…\nBadger appeared before him. But, instead of attacking directly, he swooped to Leonel's back, blocking his path toward the Zone before sending a punch toward his back.\nMonet finally relaxed slightly. This farce was over.\nBANG!\n\"AH!\"\nLeonel shook his head and sighed. Badger's bones were formed to optimize his speed and flight. Him attacking Leonel after he activated his Runes was asking for insult.\nIn truth, Badger wasn't so fragile. If not for this, how could Mayfly have been able to ride on his shoulders? However, compared to Leonel who was on the verge of forming a body as tough as a Third Dimensional metal, he was far too lacking.\nBadger screeched as the bone in his arm fractured and his knuckles contorted. He fell to his knees, holding onto his hand as his face turned flush.\nHow could it be that Badger and Mayfly would be aware of the full extent of his abilities? He had grown so powerful that he had no need to show them all of his strength as they escaped the island, not to mention the fact he had the two of them supporting him. This led to their unfortunate underestimation of him.\n\"So that's how it is…\"\nLeonel finally understood. That little girl's ability was almost like a Natural Force Art. She was imposing laws on him… It was no wonder this feeling felt somewhat similar to when he was observing the Force Crystal Core. What a fearsome ability….\nBut, Leonel knew that no ability was infallible.\nThe way that little girl always pointed at him before her ability took effect. Was it just the quirks of a child? Or was there another reason…?\nLeonel didn't believe that it had something to do with her finger. He couldn't sense anything particularly special about her movement. However, what other reasons could she have to point like that?\n'Sight?'\nLeonel's eyes narrowed.\nEveryone was closing in on him. After seeing what happened to Badger, they all redoubled their efforts. It would be longer than maybe five seconds before they were all able to surround him.\nBut, Leonel suddenly smiled.\nWith a flash, a ring on his finger glowed and the ground beneath his feet suddenly became like a pool of mud. He hadn't even sunk in to his knees when he suddenly felt the restrictions around his ankles vanish.\nLeonel's smile widened. There was no need to keep his ring a secret. It had already been reported as one of the reasons he was able to save so many youths from the Project Hunt Island. In that case, why not use it now?\nA blinding light surrounded Leonel's body. He released his Light Elemental Force without reserve as though he didn't care about the expenditure. But, it was effective. The little girl was completely unable to see him clearly, causing his binding to weaken and then break.\nLeonel jumped out from the pool of mud and grabbed at one of Badger's massive wings. The latter was in so much pain that he hardly reacted, having thought he had completed his task, only to find himself flying through the air toward a group rushing toward Leonel.\nBadger was ultimately still a Reserved General and regained his bearing quickly. He snorted in his mind, completely deriding Leonel. It was his arm that was hurt, not his wings. He wouldn't even hit these people so what was the point of doing such a thing?\nBadger's wings fanned outward and he flapped hard, stopping his forward momentum. But, it was at that moment his expression changed.\n\"Thanks.\" Leonel said simply.\nThe wind caused by Badger's movements sent an obstructive wall toward Leonel's pursuers. By the time they stopped themselves from tumbling backward, Leonel had already entered a 20 meter range of the Zone.\n\"Stop right there! Are you going to make an enemy out of the whole Slayer Legion?!\" Monet roared.\nLeonel chuckled in his mind. He had already made an enemy of the whole Empire, why would he care about the Slayer Legion?\n\"Don't worry, I'll apprehend him!\" The leading man of the Adurna family said shamelessly as he swerved his silver boat toward the Zone.\n\"Matteus, don't you dare!\"\n\"Why are you getting so worked up, I'm only trying to help.\"\nMonet was fuming, but Leonel had already leapt into the swirling portal.\nSurprisingly, at this very moment, Monet became frighteningly calm.\n\"Mayfly, Big Buddha, Violet Rain, and Mountain. Follow me. The rest of you stay put.\"\n\"HAHA! That's the way!\" The Adurna family man roared with laughter.\nNone of them seemed to notice the helplessness and anger on the faces of those who lost their place to enter, this was especially so Sea Eel and Badger who seemed to want to murder Leonel with their gazes toward his disappearing back.\nBadger clutched his only good remaining hand, flames bursting in his eyes.",

      "content": "Leonel's eyes were blinded for a moment. All he felt was that he had landed upon a soft patch of land. It was only after his sight finally came back to him that he realized he was standing atop just one of a series of rolling hills.\nThere didn't seem to be anything particularly special about this place other than the fact the air felt particularly fresh in an earthy kind of way. The Earth of Leonel's time had already put a lot of resources into developing clean energy and had saved the planet long ago. But, its air still felt somewhat artificial compared to this place.\nLeonel found it hard to explain, but he could only say that the air of his Earth felt almost too clean while this place carried just the right amount of impurity, It made people feel at ease.\nNot long after Leonel regained his bearings, a silver boat appeared in the skies. And, not long after that, Monet rushed in with Mayfly, Violet Rain, Big Buddha and Mountain.\nUpon entry, it was no surprise that 11 pairs of eyes fell upon Leonel. Some were of curiosity, some of disdain, and some of rage. The rage and disdain was mostly seen on the Slayer Legion side while the curiosity came from the Adurna side. Though, the latter seemed to carry a hint of disdain as well.\nThis only made sense, after all, Leonel was the only one here without a supporting cast. He was all alone and seen as an easy target.\nThey all knew the rules of this place. The rewards of a Zone were already set in stone in terms of their quantity. In that case, if they killed Leonel, it meant that there would be one more set of rewards for them.\nAt this point, Leonel was also feeling a bit tired. It had taken quite a bit of effort to obscure the little girl's vision with his Light Elemental Force. He hadn't thought that such a simple action would take so much out of him. He would definitely have to interrogate the dictionary about a better method.\nStill, he wasn't feeling anxious. Actually, he smiled toward the little girl.\n\"You sure caused me a lot of trouble.\"\nThere didn't seem to be any anger in his voice. He sounded like a big brother speaking to his little sister. In fact, he wasn't angry at all. He found it difficult to be angry at such an adorable little girl. She couldn't have been more than 13 or 14 years old.\nThe little girl who went by Nana seemed scared of Leonel's gaze as she hurriedly hid behind another young woman who was closer to Leonel's age.\nThe young lady glared at Leonel as though to give him a warning to not bully her little sister, but Leonel only laughed. He had always been an only child, but seeing such a scene, he felt that having such an adorable little sister wouldn't be so bad.\n\"Young man, you go by Leonel, correct? What say you to becoming a retainer of my Adurna family?\" Matteus suddenly spoke.\nHe had seen Leonel's strength. Plus… From what he overheard from Monet's conversation with him…\nMonet, who had just been planning a move on Leonel, suddenly paused, her brows furrowing slightly. They were already outnumbered by one. If Leonel joined them, it would be by two.\nShe had already been forced to enter due to the appearance of Matteus. If she didn't, their side wouldn't have anyone who could stand up to him. It could be said that this training experience they set aside for the youths was completely ruined now.\nMonet sent a glare toward Leonel as though warning him of the consequences of accepting. It was very likely that the Adurna family would just snatch his treasure and not mind him at all.\nLeonel laughed lightly. How could he not know of what Matteus was thinking? However, instead of directly refusing, he suddenly thought of something.\n\"Oh? Are you sure you want to accept me?\"\nMatteus raised an eyebrow. After a moment, he 'understood'.\n\"Don't worry, there are no irreconcilable differences between you and the Slayer Legion. In fact, Monet's actions could be considered a senior bullying a junior. You have every right to leave.\"\nMonet's expression darkened while those who followed her in seemed somewhat embarrassed. They had been so enraged by Leonel's comments that it seemed they forgot they were the ones initially in the wrong.\nHowever, Leonel shook his head to these words.\n\"This isn't what I meant.\" Leonel said with a light smile. \"I'm already aware of certain things. Old Hutch has a decent impression of me, if I inform him of what happened, dealing with this really wouldn't be much of a problem.\n\"What I mean to say is that I once almost destroyed a Fort of The Empire, are you still certain you want to take me in?\"\nMatteus' expression changed. It wasn't just him, but Monet's as well as everyone else.\nMonet frowned. Was there such a thing? She had to admit that she didn't investigate Leonel much past knowing he was affiliated with Hutch. That was about all.\nAfter a while, Matteus recovered.\n\"Just The Empire? Nothing but a puppet on some strings, yet it dares to call itself an Empire.\"\nLeonel's brows raised. This was exactly why he said so much. He wanted to know more about the relationship between The Empire and these hidden families. Matteus' response was quite… interesting.\n\"Oh, that's good.\" Leonel pretended to be relieved. \"I also killed a few members of the Brazinger family, is that alright too?\"\nAt this point, everyone almost fainted. Was this person a magnet for trouble? If it was anyone else, they might have thought he was lying for some fame, but didn't they see his boldness with their own two eyes? He even dared to forcefully enter a Zone owned by the Slayer Legion.\nMatteus' lip twitched. But in the end, his expression became solemn.\nThe relationship between the hidden families weren't so simple. They couldn't be considered to be allies, but they couldn't be considered to be entirely not either. They all shared a similar goal or goals.\nBy now, Matteus was already thinking of using Leonel in exchange for a favor. If he brought Leonel in, gained that treasure of his, and gained a debt of gratitude from the Brazinger family… Just how many birds was he killing with this single stone?\nHowever, what he could have never expected was for Leonel to start sinking into the ground right before his eyes, leaving him stunned once again.\n\"I'll think about your offer.\" Leonel said with what seemed like a genuine smile.\n\"Boy! Hold it right there!\" Big Buddha stepped forward to try and stop Leonel. \"Don't you think you've broken enough rules?!\"\nUnfortunately for them, Leonel had caught them completely off guard with his questions. They couldn't even react before his head disappeared and the earth that had once been mud went back to normal.\nBeneath the ground, Leonel held his breath before bringing one of his silver green whistles to his lips.\n'Those families really don't fear The Empire… And what was that about puppet on a string…? And that flash in his eyes when I mentioned the Brazinger family… It seems that their relationship isn't simple either…'\nLeonel shook his head, it was about time he found out just what this place was…\n[ *Ping* ]\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone detected: Merlin's Prophecy. King Arthur]\nLeonel's expression became weird. King Arthur shouldn't have been a real person, many believed he was just an embellished legend. Beyond that, though… another Merlin's Prophecy Zone? Who the hell was this person? He should have been fabricated too…\n[Sub-Dimensional Zone grade: SS]\n[Clear requirements: Save King Arthur]\n[Side Quest: Love Triangle.

      "content": "Leonel took a deep breath. He had thought that having the 99% accuracy of his father's dictionary would make things a breeze. At least then, he wouldn't have to worry about screwing himself over by accidentally failing the mission requirements.\nHowever, he could have never expected that the dictionary would be so vague at this time.\nWhat did it mean to make King Arthur a part of history? Was it acknowledging that King Arthur was fake? In that case, how could King Arthur appear in a Zone?\nAccording to Leonel's understanding, Zones were parts of past where higher Dimensions influenced the lower Dimension. Only by resolving these instances would these timelines smoothly integrate with Earth. Once this integration was completed, Earth would reach the equilibrium necessary to breakthrough and reach the next Dimensional Tier.\nBut, how did a… 'Mythological Zone' factor into this?\n\"What's a Mythological Zone?\" Leonel asked.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, a Mythological Zone is a legend of humans that has propagated enough to be on the verge of becoming truth. ]\nLeonel's eyes narrowed. He was still confused…\nHe sunk into his thoughts for a moment. He still had to wait for the two groups above him to leave, so he really did have some time to waste.\nSuddenly, his eyes flashed.\nWhen Aina was explaining to him the differences between the Dimensions, she mentioned how grand the gap between Dimensions was. If he remembered correctly, she said that one could say a novel was in the 2D while its writer was in the 3D.\nHere, King Arthur was technically a 2D construct. He was just a legend passed down through generations to the point he became a nice tale to tell to children. His stories could be easily manipulated and changed on a whim depending on the mood of the story teller.\nBut, if one thought about it from another angle, wasn't this act of continuously passing his legend down like a higher Dimensional world acting on a lower Dimensional one? In that case, wouldn't it meet the requirements necessary to cause a Zone to appear?!\nThe moment Leonel completed this thought, he felt as though an explosion had gone off in his mind. If this was true, then the danger Mythological Zones presented couldn't be underestimated.\nEntering a Zone from true history was one thing. Most people there would ultimately be normal individuals Leonel could handle with ease. Maybe only a handful would be like Joan or the Mayan Priest.\nBut in a world like this… The number of enemies that could threaten his life wouldn't be few.\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath.\nSuch a world had a high chance of becoming a Unique Zone according to the dictionary. Maybe this time, Leonel would be able to find out just what truly happened in the Joan Zone…\nWho were those people? What had Joan's purpose been? None of her actions had seemed to make any at all… Uncle Montez had also said back then that Joan's Zone had almost become a Unique Zone as well, in fact it was right on the verge…\nThere were too many questions Leonel had had no choice but to ignore until now…\nAfter a while, Leonel calmed, his eyes becoming deathly still. Then, he released his Internal Sight in full force, his calculative mind rushing into overdrive.\n**\n\"Hear ye, hear ye!\"\nIn the square of a small town, a man with a large bridge nose unfurled a scroll with a length of at least half his height. Judging by his attire, he shouldn't come from such a small place. Even the Baron of this Fief couldn't afford to wear such luxurious clothing.\n\"His Majesty has decreed that all young, able bodied men between the ages of 16 and 25 will hereby join the noble armies of Camelot!\"\nThe crowd, which had been gathered due to the commotion caused by the herald's entourage, showed a mixture of reactions. But, by an overwhelming margin, excitement ruled. This wasn't the modern era, after all. If such a conscription happened in Leonel's time, people would likely be up in arms. But, in this era, it was a matter of honor. And, for young men like this, it was their chance to rise to a higher standing in life and maybe even… become a knight!\nLeonel stood amidst the crowd with a pleasantly surprised expression. He had purposely traveled to this small town for two reasons. First, he wanted to enter a town the others wouldn't. With his Internal Sight, he definitely had a massive advantage in orienting himself in this world.\nThe second reason was because compared to the other villages that had been nearby, this was a relatively flourishing place. The options it would give him were far beyond what the closer villages could.\nHis initial plan had been to earn himself a spot within this Barony's guards and find a way up from there. He had even gotten himself a set of cheap hemp clothing from a farmer to blend in better. The only unfortunate part was that he had to cover his hair in dirt and mud so that its bronze color would stand out less.\nBut, he had never expected to run into a conscription. This made things far easier.\nAfter a moment, he understood that this shouldn't be coincidence. Since Mythological Zones were based on stories and not true history, they were far more flexible in their storylines as a result. Its possible that this conscription happened precisely because Leonel was here.\nWhen the herald was finished with his decree, he completely ignored the excited expressions of many of the young men. These commoner folk had no idea how bloody the battlefield was. All they knew of was the glory, and each of them thought their sons, brothers and lovers would all come back heroes. When, the reality was that death was inevitable for a large majority of them.\nHe turned back and signaled toward a man wearing tight fitting leather armor.\nThe man was tall, almost as tall as even Leonel. His shoulders seemed far broader though, almost making him look like a box. Due to this, despite his height, he still seemed a bit stocky.\n\"Gather up to be registered! You'll be given an evaluation based on your abilities! Clear out! Clear out! I only want to see my future men here! If anyone dares to snub His Majesty's Decree, I'll personally lop his head off!\"\nThe man's voice boomed.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow as he follow this crowd. As expected… This was just a low ranking officer but his stats already averaged 0..70. This was already better than Leonel when he first awakened…",

      "content": "It wasn't long before it was Leonel's turn to be evaluated. He stood before the stocky man who he now knew went by the name of Heckle — a name that was maybe all too apropos for his outrageously loud voice.\n\"Not bad, not bad. Your build is good.\"\nThe man repeatedly nodded. It seemed it was quite rare for him to see people as tall as Leonel, so he was quite satisfied.\n\"Attack me with everything you have. The longer you last, the better your evaluation will be.\"\nLeonel's expression became slightly weird. If he really used everything he had, this man would end up as a cripple. And that would be the best outcome.\n'I can't use my full power. If I stand out too much, they'll wonder why it was no one in this town knew me… Just enough to beat him should be fine.'\nThis town barely had a population of a thousand. If there were any outstanding people, they should have appeared long ago. So, Leonel's choice was the wisest. Of course, he had every intention of standing out more later on.\nLeonel took a step forward and threw out a punch.\nHeckle was startled. This punch was even faintly better than something he could throw. He knew that Leonel would be good, but he didn't expect him to be this good.\nHowever, when he saw the slight clumsiness in Leonel's actions, he sighed a slight breath of relief. This sort of clumsiness couldn't be faked. It seemed that despite his stature, this young man wasn't very experienced in battle.\nLeonel really wasn't faking this. It could be said that all his battle prowess came from copying the spear consciousnesses. He didn't have much experience boxing, so his form was a little off and uncoordinated. But, this was to his benefit. Like this, he could show off his potential while also not raising suspicion.\nDespite the power in his punch, Heckle easily evaded, countering with a strong uppercut. Using his smaller height and Leonel's inexperience to his benefit, he closed the distance with a step.\nLeonel was inwardly shocked. He could easily see through Heckle's movements, and even dodging was a simple matter for him. But, that was only if he relied on his true stats. If he kept suppressing himself, he might even lose a few teeth.\nJust when he felt he might just have to eat the punch, Heckle's fist came to a stop.\n\"Sorry, sorry. I got a bit too excited, hehe.\" Heckle took a step back.\nHe realized at that moment that he accidentally made Leonel's test more difficult than the others. He couldn't help it. Though Leonel was inexperienced, his raw strength was even better than his own with vast room for improvement.\n\"I'll give you a four star evaluation. Like this, you'll have a chance to become a squire for a good knight. Go on, stand off to the side.\"\nIt was clear Heckle was in a good mood finding a talent like Leonel.\nLeonel expressed his thanks with a smile, pretending to be a bit shaken before recovering.\nAccording to Heckle, a one star evaluation was only enough to join infantry. Three star was the threshold to be able to be nurtured as a leader of men. Four star and five stars were able to gain special nurturing, most of them became the squires of knights. Five star evaluations could gain a spot next to some of the best knights in Camelot. Though those knights were still short of the legendary 12 knights of the round table, they were only a step below.\nLeonel was satisfied with this evaluation. Other than a handful of three star evaluations of those from the Baron's house, there were no others even close to him.\nThe young men from the Barony frowned hearing Heckle's words. This commoner gained a four star evaluation but they only received three stars?\nHowever, did they dare to say anything in opposition? Heckle had beaten them all with absolute ease. It was likely that he was the strongest person in their town currently. What could they even do to him? In the end, they could only send glares toward Leonel, showing disdain toward his dirty appearance.\nToward such a thing, Leonel could only sigh. He knew that it would only get worse from here on out. Even though this Zone was based on a legend, he knew that the world of knights was filled with nobles. If even three star talents dared to send such looks toward him, it could be imagined what four star and five star talent nobles would say and do…\n'Whatever, let's just finish this Zone off as quickly as possible…'\n**\nA few tens of miles from Leonel's location, the others were undergoing similar experiences. However, it seemed that their entry may not have been as seamless as they once thought.\n...\nThe location was a castle that seemed to have been pulled directly out of a fairytale.\nIt was a land of complete blackness to the point even the grass that coated the land reflected like obsidian beneath the moonlight.\nAmidst this darkness, there was a mountain with peaks so sharp it might have been possible to mistake them for large spears piercing toward the skies. Blended in with this mountain range was a castle of black that carried the same jagged sharpness.\nWithin this castle, seated on a throne that carried just as much darkness, there was a woman. Her skin was so pale that one could almost see right through it. Her hair was so black that it was difficult to tell where it stopped and her throne began.\nHer dress was the same, but the cups that held up her breasts seemed to be carved out from white bone…\n\"I sense 12 stars of fate…\" She suddenly mumbled, her cherry lips parting and closing in an alluring manner.\nThe woman awoke, her irises radiating a deep blackness. However, there was a hint of confusion in her eye.\nAccording to the prophecy, there would be 12 stars of fate that could decide the path this world would take. She had always thought that those 12 were the knights of the round table…\nSo why was it that she suddenly sensed auras of fate that had nothing to do with them?\n'Interesting, interesting…'\nAt that moment, the sound of footsteps entered the woman's ears as she lazily lied on her throne.\n\"Lord Modred! There's someone who wants to see you… This servant tried to stop them but…!\"\nLeonel would probably be rendered speechless once again at this point. Wasn't Modred a man? It can't be that this Zone was taking anime a bit too seriously as well, right?",

      "content": "\"Haha! Boy, you sure are an eager one. How many times do you want to lose?\"\nHeckle laughed uproariously as Leonel suffered another punch to the jaw. The latter felt his world spin as he was forced to take several steps back. It was only after he shook his head multiple times that he finally recovered.\nIt had already been a week since Leonel had come to this world. According to the dictionary, this Zone had an even greater time dilation than the Joan Zone at 1:50. This meant that about a year needed to pass here for a week to pass in the outside world. Apparently, Mythological Zones tended to have the largest time dilations compared to other Zones of a similar rank.\nAt the moment, the moon hung high in the skies and they had set up camp for the night. A large fire sent billowing smoke upward at the center of an arrangement of tent.\nLeonel was sparring with Heckle once again. In fact, this wasn't just the second time. Leonel had already lost count.\nAfter losing the first time, he had been fascinated by the man's skill. He felt he was learning quite a lot though he continued to lose.\nThe journey to their destination was a bit of a trial as well. The wilderness wasn't safe by any means. Setting aside bandits and rogues, just the wild beasts were truly troublesome to deal with. Much like this people of this Zone, the beasts were also more powerful than they should be. So, this wasn't easy by any stretch of the imagination.\nSo, it wasn't surprising that the other recruits were dead tired. Leonel was the only one who would use such valuable rest time to torture himself some more.\nHow could they know that this so-called trial was nothing more than a joke to Leonel?\n\"Again.\"\nLeonel wiped the blood from his lips. Of course, if he didn't want to be hurt, he only had to activate his Metal Synergy Runes. But, what would be the point of that?\nHe brandished his fists once more. This time, it was clear that his stance was much more refined. His right fist hung by his chin, allowing his left to take the lead. He narrowed the target Heckle had to attack by extending his left foot and rolling his shoulder.\nIn a flash, he took a step forward, sending two jabs in quick succession.\nHeckle smiled, entering a similar stance as though mirroring Leonel perfectly. It was rare to find someone so interested in his boxing style. Usually, these brats only wanted to pick up a sword or spear as quickly as possible.\nOf course, he had no idea that Leonel was less interested in the style itself and more so just wanted to win. He found trying to defeat Heckle while keeping a cap on his stats was nearly impossible.\nIt was likely that he could grasp the technique much faster if he used his Dream World and Dream Clone ability. But, he was spending all his time at night calculating for the formation of his Ninth and Tenth Node, he wouldn't spend it on this.\nHowever… He was still making progress.\nHeckle used his footwork to dip just outside the range of Leonel's jabs. He followed up quickly, wanting to take advantage of Leonel overextending himself to wrap around his side.\nBut, Leonel had learned quite a lot in the past few days. Instead of retreating, he stepped forward as Heckle tried to sweep to his left side. With a single pivot of his hips, he and Heckle faced each other once more.\n\"Hoho.\" Heckle grinned. \"It seems your footwork got a bit better. That's right, always stay square to your opponent.\"\nLeonel and Heckle's match became a spar of movement. Around the fire, the jeers of the other soldiers could be heard.\n\"Captain, the kid's gonna beat you this time!\"\n\"HAHA! I'm never gonna let you live this one down!\"\nHeckle grinned hearing his men, not minding as all. He felt quite gratified seeing Leonel's progress.\nOf course, while there those who were happy, there would always be those who were gloomy. The youths of the town Barony had gotten tired of hearing praise for Leonel over these few days. But, they still had to admit they were no match for him. His performance during their daily marches was more than enough to prove this without a shred of doubt.\n\"Oof…\"\nLeonel suffered a fist to his chest and fell to the ground, feeling that the air had been knocked out of him once again. He couldn't help but sigh, it seemed he had lost again.\n\"Alright, alright. That's enough for tonight pretty boy brat. If go any longer, you really might win one. My old bones can't take this.\"\nLeonel was quite helpless toward this nickname. He had managed to use an ink sack from the octopus beast's body to dye his hair a deep black. Plus, with his new leather armor, he looked every bit the part of a promising squire.\nThe only shame was that his hair seemed to reject the ink. So, he had to reapply it everyday. Luckily, with how massive the octopus had been, he wouldn't run out even after a decade passed.\nLeonel smiled lightly. \"Thanks for the help Captain Heckle.\"\n'Hmph, just a useless skill…' The Barony youths looked on gloomily.\n…\nThe next week passed by swiftly. On that day, around noon, they finally saw massive castle walls in the distance. In fact, with his sight, Leonel could see five sets of walls, each getting progressively taller until they all pointed toward a majestic castle that seemed carved of jade.\nLeonel had never read about such a grand city. From what he could see, it was at least 50 kilometers from end to end, and that was just what was within the walls. As for the cultured lands around it, it was several times that.\nHeckle didn't lead them to the gates. It seemed that they still didn't have the right to do such a thing. Instead, they were taken to a place connected by dusty roads. These roads all led to an open space where numerous Captains just like Heckle had their youths standing around them.\nEveryone's attention seemed focus on a large tent up ahead.\nLeonel's ear twitched as he heard the clanking of metal. At that moment, the flap of the tent was slowly raised, causing the open space to fall into complete silence.\nIt was a knight. The excitement in the hearts of the youths ratcheted up several levels. It was as though they were all meeting their idol.\nThe knight swept an indifferent glance over them all.\n\"Those who've been selected to join the Mage Academy, stand to this side. Those one, two and three star talents, go over there. Four and five star talents, gather before me now.\"\nNumerous haughty and prideful youths puffed their chests out as they moved to stand before the knight, their eyes sparkling.\n\"Go on.\" Heckle gave Leonel a slap to the back. \"Do us proud.\"\nLeonel smiled lightly and moved forward as well. Numerous gazes swept over him, including those of the four and five star youths. However, when they noticed his standard issue leather armor, a hint of contempt could be seen in their eyes.\nLeonel could only ignore such things. However, when the knight spoke once again, the youths no longer had the time to send disdainful glances toward him.\n\"There are 57 of you? What bullshit. Do you captains think that four and five star talents are really so cheap?!\"\nThe knight roared. He didn't like the idea of going out to find talents like this in the first place. What talents couldn't they find right here in Camelot?\nTo make it worse, relying on mere captains to make this judgment was even more ridiculous.\nA sharp Force flooded out from the body of the knight, causing many of the youths before him to grow weak at the knees. Though Leonel didn't know it, many of them had bribed their captains with wealth in order to gain such evaluations, how could they not be horrified? So, in certain respects, the knight was correct to react in this way.\nHis force jetted out, drawing a massive circle of 100 meters in diameter. The cold sweat on the youths grew. In that moment, the felt as though if even a hair of that Force hit them, they would die without knowing what happened.\n\"Since you think this is all a joke, you all can battle to the death. None of you are allowed to leave this circle until only four remain. Should any of you try to flee from this circle or are kicked out of it before this happens, you'll die beneath my blade!\"\nA bloody, murderous intent soared into the skies.\nIt was only now these youths who were just feeling proud of themselves realized that becoming a knight wouldn't be so simple.. As for those who bribed their way to this position, they were even more shaken. What clowns were they? Paying to die?",

      "content": "\"I forgot to mention something else. The first 20 who die will have the captain's who recommended them follow them in death!\"\nEven Leonel was stunned by this sudden turn of events. He could see the disdain the knight held for all of them, but to order that 53 of them should be killed… wasn't that a bit too much? Even beyond that, he was even dragging the captains into this?!\nAt that moment, the training grounds turned completely silent. Not to mention the youths locked within the circle, even the captains that had selected them couldn't stop themselves from shaking. What were mere captains worth in the face of a true Knight?\nThose captains who knew they had bended the rules in exchange for benefits all paled considerably. Even those who had followed the rules were trembling. So what if they followed the rules? In a battle royale, who was to say that someone deserving wouldn't die? In that case, wouldn't they be screwed?\nMaybe the only one who didn't have a great reaction was Leonel. He didn't notice when it was, but he had been in so many life and death situations to now that he was no longer affected by just this much.\n\"What are you all standing around for?\" The knight growled. \"If someone doesn't die within the next minute, all 57 of you can die.\"\nThe words were like a spark that lit a raging fire. Leonel had only managed to raise an eyebrow at the words before he found several attacks coming toward him, one of which was actually coated in Force!\nLeonel frowned. 'He didn't give us any weapons? No, some of them do have weapons, it's just that he couldn't be bothered to care whether or not everything was fair…'\nThe more Leonel thought about it, the more he disliked this knight. Testing them was fine, by why was it that this test was so despicable? The worst part was that those who were more likely to have bribed their captains were the most likely to have the best equipment on them.\nHowever, the fact one could attack Leonel with Force definitely meant that he was worthy of his title of four or five star genius.\nHeckle paled when he saw so many attack Leonel right from the start. It was as though they all had a tacit agreement to get rid of the 'lesser thans' first.\nHeckle had followed the rules. He never once took a bribe. But, if Leonel were to die so early on, it wouldn't matter. He would have to follow him in death.\nLeonel sighed. He could faintly see Heckle's face drain of all color from his vantage point as a dagger and two fists came his way.\nHe shifted backward, sinking into his boxing stance. He could sense every change within this hundred meter range. In fact, he could already see that within the next second or two, at least three talents would fall, all of them dressed just as simply as him.\nA flicker of rage sparked in Leonel's heart. What a cruel world… In that case, they shouldn't blame him for not showing any mercy.\nLeonel's left fist flattened out, whipping out in a downward slapping motion that cleanly hit the dagger wielding hand. His actions were so fast that the young man before him hardly had time to react before he found his wrist swelling with pain.\nThe dagger clanged to the ground as the young man called out in pain, but Leonel had already moved on from him, facing the two remaining punches.\nHe rolled his shoulder, causing the fist to skim off his defenses. The strike alone should have carried nearly 1.00 in strength, but Leonel's Runes flickered beneath his armor out of the sight of everyone else.\nLet alone causing damage to him, Leonel's attacker was lucky to only catch a piece of Leonel. Before the young man could even react to the bursting pain his fist felt, Leonel had already taken a step forward, his hips winding and his back foot pivoting against the ground hard as he sent a punch toward the final fist.\nHeckle's face drained of all color. He could see the benefit of his training with Leonel right before him, but he could also see the Force coated on the final young man's fist. He knew how strong Leonel was… but his background was too lacking. He simply didn't know about these things. If he met this fist head on… he was finished.\nBANG!\nHowever, completely out of Heckle's expectations, Leonel's sent the young man flying. A mournful, muffled cry sounded through the training grounds. But, it was completely drowned out by the sounds of battle.\nLeonel frowned. 'Killing with my fists is too difficult. Had that been my spear…'\nLeonel sighed. He couldn't take out his spears now. If he did, he would expose his spatial bracelet. Who knew what kind of consequences that would have?\nBut…\nLeonel's steps didn't pause as he pressed his two fingers together and turned, jabbing a bloody hole into the throat of the young man who threw the normal fist.\nWith another step, he entered the range of the young man with the dagger. The latter held onto his wrist, crying out in pain. But, Leonel didn't seem to care as he threw a punch toward his head.\n'[Call of the Wind]!'\nBANG!\nThe young man's head exploded into a cloud of blood.\nLet alone the crowd, this shocked even Leonel. He had only applied [Call of the Wind] to his fists because he found that his fingers were too vulnerable to continue using like a spear. Since he didn't want to expose his Runes so easily to toughen them up, this was the better option.\nBut, never had he expected the result to be so exaggerated.\nAt that moment, a hushed silence fell over the battlefield.\nBlasting a person's head apart with a single punch… What kind of concept was that?!\nThe young man who had awakened Force and attacked Leonel earlier trembled fiercely. He didn't even seem to register his broken arm as he tried to scramble backward. The further he got from Leonel, the better.\n\"HAHA! You did it Leonel! You awakened Inner Strength!\"\nLeonel smiled bitterly when he heard Heckle's words. At this moment, that wasn't necessarily a good thing.\nSeveral pairs of eyes landed on Leonel. They all knew what to do. Several youths had already stood out amongst the crowd, killing targets not long after Leonel had.. If they didn't band together against these youths, they would die.",

      "content": "Heckle seemed to realize that he had spoken out of turn, but it was too late to regret it. He had been on the brink of life and death just a moment ago, yet Leonel suddenly pulled a reverse that saved his life. How could he not be excited?\nA moment later, Heckle's expression had tensed once more.\nLeonel frowned and entered his stance, not forgetting to pick up the dagger on the ground first.\nAnother three slowly moved toward Leonel, their eyes flickering with hints of caution. This caution was not only for Leonel who was before them, but also toward one another. It wasn't as though they had suddenly begun to trust each other just because they tacitly understood they needed to work together.\nSeemingly understanding this, Leonel no longer hesitated as he dashed forward. He completely ignored the young man with a broken arm, deeming him less of a threat. With the strengthening on his Internal Sight, Leonel knew that this young man had only formed a single Force Node and it was in the very arm Leonel had already broken. He was practically a cripple.\nWhen Leonel entered a five meter radius of the three before him, he shot out the dagger in his hand. It whistled through the air, piercing one of them through the throat.\nIn what felt like a flash, he appeared before the remaining two, his eyes flickering with a cold, calculative light.\nHis speed was simply too fast.\nHis palm appeared on one of their chests. As though being met by an unstoppable force, the young man was sent flying through the air, crashing into a few that were taking the opportunity to surround Leonel.\nLeonel's fist jabbed forward. Under the influence of [Call of the Wind], it felt as though hurricane force winds were ripping the young man apart, leaving his face distorted even before Leonel's strike landed.\nAnother rain of blood shot into the skies as another corpse fell beneath Leonel's fist. However, Leonel himself was still frowning.\nIt looked impressive that their heads were exploding like this. But, the truth was that this simply displayed Leonel's lack of control.\n[Call of the Wind] was initially a long range attacking technique meant to be applied to arrows, darts and similar weapons. Leonel had modified it to be used with a spear, but the essence of the technique remained the same. Both allowed him to focus his Force into a point.\nHowever, his fists seemed completely incapable of doing this. It made Leonel realize that maybe his mastery over this technique wasn't as great as he initially thought. If he could apply better control, he felt [Call of the Wind] could be maybe even 10 times more powerful than it was now.\nAs Leonel thought, his body flickered amidst the four and five star talents. His steps held the shadow of Heckle's skill within them, mixed in with a hint of the primitive spearwoman.\nThere seemed to be a mysterious rhythm to his steps as though he wasted not a single movement. It was as though he could plan several movements ahead, deftly escaping encirclements — advancing on a whim, retreating with a thought…\nLeonel came to realize in that moment that there was more to fighting than just launching the strongest attack. All this time, he had been using his ability to think of ways land his blows. He always felt that as long as he landed a good hit, with his strength, the battle would be all but over.\nBut, what would happen when his opponent was several times more powerful than him? Or, more appropriate to the current situation, what if he was simply outnumbered and moving to take down one person would cause him to be vulnerable to another?\nHe suddenly understood now…\nHis body felt lighter, his steps grew softer, and even a mysterious aura began to emanate from his body.\n'This is it… this is what I felt when I was watching the primitive woman battle…'\nLeonel could have long since taken another spear from the Spear Domain ring, but he hadn't all this time because he felt he still hadn't fully understood.\nWhen he watched the primitive woman battle, he remembered being in awe. She had faced so many enemies, yet, not only did she defeat them, but even when they wanted to escape, all of their paths of retreat were cut off.\nThe more Leonel thought about that scene, the more incredulous he found it. How could one person stop several from running away? If it was just a matter of her speed being several times greater, that would be fine. But, Leonel knew that though she was faster than those men, it hadn't been exaggerated to that point.\nThat only left one explanation… there was something mysterious about her movement… Not only was she faster than them, but it also felt like they couldn't take even a step forward without her permission…. Complete control…\nAll this time, Leonel had been so focused on his flexibility and imitating her lightness and quickness. But, this was all superficial. The truth behind the mystery of her footwork was her mind and the way she manipulated her opponents…\nLeonel sank into a trance. The entire battlefield reflected in his mind as though he could see it all from above.\nHis hair fluttered in the wind as he walked through the youths that attacked him, yet, they couldn't even touch the hemp of his clothes.\nThe knight's eyes narrowed. He had been observing the entire battlefield and there really were four youths who had caught his attention before, which was why he set the requirement to just four. But, he had never expected a fifth to appear.\nAnd not only that but…\nAt that moment, the knight's narrowed gaze widened as a wave of shock overwhelmed him.\n'General Star!'\n\"Stop! Stop! STOP!\"\nThe sudden roars of the knight caught them all off guard. How was it so easy for a group of people who had just been hell bent on killing one another to suddenly come to a grinding halt like this? However, who really dared to ignore the words of a knight?\n\"You, you, you, you and you. The rest of you can scram back to the one to three star talents.\"\nEveryone was stunned. Weren't they supposed to be fighting to the death? What was happening?\nAs for the young men who were called forward, they too were stunned. Including Leonel. He didn't think that the knight would suddenly grow soft hearted, so what was happening exactly?\nLeonel and the other four youths looked at one another. Not a single one of them wasn't covered in blood, but it was obvious at a glance that none of it was their own.\nOne of them was wearing standard issue leather armor like Leonel, but the other three had patches of metal armor here and there, making them look like real warriors. It was clear their standard was better in comparison to Leonel.\n\"You five and those hoping to become Mage Apprentices follow me.\"\nThe knight turned and walked toward the first gates of Camelot, not explaining anything to anyone. But, no one dared to question him… least of all the bribed captains who just got a new lease on life.. It was safe to say they wouldn't dare take such payment again in the future.",

      "content": "Though Leonel was baffled by the sudden turn of events, he soon decided to cautiously proceed. He felt that this might be another instance of this Mythological Zone finding him opportunities. He had no idea that things weren't this simple at all.\nThat said, the current Leonel was fascinated by the Mage Academy the knight mentioned. The knight had originally split off the youths that would be attending this academy to one side, but before Leonel could observe them, he suddenly found himself in a battle royale to the death. So, for obvious reasons, he hadn't had the time or mind to pay to them at all.\nAfter questioning the dictionary, Leonel had learned a lot of things about Mythological Zones. But, maybe the most important thing was that anything that could happen here was capable of happening in the real world.\nDue to this, Mythological Zones were highly sought after in high level worlds. In fact, world wars — the likes of which could make Earth's own world wars look like child's play — were almost guaranteed every time one appeared.\nThis may sound odd. There shouldn't be anything different about this Zone in comparison to others. One also needed to remember that the so-called 'rewards' of the Zones weren't prepared by the Zone itself, but rather higher level worlds investing in the progress of Earth. It could be said that Zones didn't have any rewards for clearing them at all aside from helping bring one's world closer to the next evolution tier.\nThings only began to change when Gold Zones were taken into account. One could only begin taking treasures out of Zones at this level. In any lower level Zones, they would disappear.\nThat said… Mythological Zones were a special case.\nIt was still impossible to take treasures out of Mythological Zones unless they were Gold in grade. Since this was still considered a Black Grade Zone, Leonel was obviously out of luck in this regard. However, the crux of the value of a Mythological Zone was exactly in those earlier words… Everything that happened in a Mythological Zone could happen in the real world.\nOn the surface, this seems like a useless detail. But, really think about it for a moment… What if a Mythological Zone had a completely new power system? What if they had a completely unique way of utilizing Force or drawing Force Arts? Wouldn't that mean that whoever explored a Mythological Zone would gain access to this completely new system?\nThe value of such a thing was unimaginable!\nFor this reason, Mythological Zones were seen as treasures of the universe. Though it was impossible that they would always provide a completely new magic system, there was always the chance of such a thing. And, even when this chance ended in failure, it was always possible to find unique views that could progress already established branches of power.\nWhat Leonel lacked the most now wasn't strength, but knowledge in how to apply it. He only had one technique — [Call of the Wind]. Aside from this, he was completely relying on his own instinct and the battle sense of his spear consciousnesses.\nHe had initially been planning on using some of his rewards from this Zone to solve this weakness before he left to Terrain. But, if he could get the techniques he needed from this Mythological Zone instead… the benefits might be unimaginable.\nOf course, even with this set aside, Leonel was fascinated by the Mage Academy. If everything that happened here was really possible in the real world… what would happen if he joined the Mage Academy instead?\nIf he had the chance, he would. But, unfortunately, for whatever reason, Heckle hadn't tested his aptitude to become a mage.\n'Forget it, it's most important that I focus on completing the missions. Learning this Mythological Zone's unique power systems comes secondary…'\nLeonel couldn't forget that he was on a timer. Every Zone had a hidden timer hanging over the heads of those who entered it. He had found this out the hard way in the Joan of Arc Zone.\nAccording to the dictionary, the timer for this world was set to around 10 years. That was the equivalent of 10 weeks to the outside world. He had to figure things out by then.\nThat sounded like a lot of time, but Leonel knew that it wasn't. In that time, he needed to gain enough power and prestige in Camelot to actually affect change. In an already established Kingdom like this one, let alone 10 years, even 30 might not be enough.\nBut… displaying his talents just might be a great help to that. So, if he had the chance, he would display them more. Now that he was here, there was no need to keep holding back. He'd begin to slowly show what he had.\nLeonel was lost in his thoughts when a sudden voice awakened him.\n\"Elys, I've brought your brats. Hurry up and scram out here.\"\nLeonel looked up to find that they had already long since enter Camelot. Not only had they entered, but they had gone as deep as the third city section.\nCamelot had five walls and five gates. The most outer wall open to a section known as the outer city, the second gate led to the upper outer city, and the third, where they were now, was known as the inner city.\nBeyond that, the fourth gate led to the noble city and the fifth led to the true core of Camelot.\nOf course, these were just colloquial names. Officially, all of these cities were collectively known as Camelot. If one could live here, they were already the cream of the crop. But, where people could have divisions amongst each other, they would…\nCurrently, Leonel and the group of youths had been led to the inner city and were now before the doors of a small shop. Compared to the large buildings all around, it seemed out of place. Through the windows, it was possible to see bookshelves that covered the whole shop. It was to the point that books that couldn't find a place were strewn about wildly.\nAt that moment, a woman wearing dark blue mage robes and a pointed hat that seemed to big for her head pushed her way out and faced the youths and the knight.\n\"Them?\"\nThe woman frowned. Or rather, Leonel thought she did. It was a bit hard to see her face through her drooping hat.\n\"These are the brats the captains picked. If you want to blame someone, blame them. If it wasn't because I lost that bet, do you think I would have picked them up for you?\"\nElys waved her hand that looked surprisingly fair. At this point, Leonel was expecting an old hag. If it wasn't for the barely noticeable curves and her voice, he wouldn't have been able to tell she was a woman at all.\n\"Alright, I've done my part. Now, you five. Follow me.\"\nLeonel saw a barely perceptible flicker of excitement in the knight's eyes when he said these words. Causing him to be confused.\nIt seemed Elys noticed this as well and looked up curiously. She was likely quite familiar with this knight and wanted to know what could excite him. But, Leonel would have never expected her eyes to land on him.\nWell… He thought it landed on him. Her body seemed to be pointed in his direction. It was simply too difficult to catch a glimpse of her face.\nSuddenly, her body trembled violently as though she could fall over at any moment.\n\"Jarin! Are you trying to steal talents from me?! Do you believe I won't blast you into ash right now?!\"\nThe knight who had been ready to take them away looked toward Elys with an incredulous expression.\nWhen he saw where Elys was looking, he protected Leonel to his back.\n\"Don't you dare, old witch. This is my future general!\"",

      "content": "\"…\"\nLeonel didn't know what to say.\nThis was the inner city. Everyone here thought themselves to be refined people of the upper middle class. Seeing a knight and a mage get into a screaming contest in the middle of a busy cobble stone street was definitely not the norm for them.\nHowever, whereas they would scold and lambaste a commoner doing such a thing, none of them dared to offend a knight, and least of all a knight that didn't mind offending a mage.\nMages were rarer and thus more valued. Any knight who didn't mind arguing with a mage was definitely one with relatively high standing even amongst knights. As a result, instead of seeing these two as uncultured, those nearby were rather curious to find out just what could cause two individuals of such standing to act in this way without care for their image.\n\"What bullshit General Star? This young man is a born mage! Are you trying to waste his life away?\"\n\"Nonsense. Do you know how rare General Stars are? Our Kingdom only has 31, and 13 of them are the Lords of the Round Table and His Majesty! I'll fight it out with you right here, old witch!\"\n\"Bah, who's an old witch? This lady here is still very young! Say one more word of nonsense and I won't hold back any longer!\"\nElys looked up toward the knight, Jarin, her hands on her hips. Like this, Leonel could finally catch a glimpse of her face and he had to say that she truly was a young lady. A gorgeous young lady, at that.\nBut, judging by the way Jarin kept calling her an old witch… he had a feeling there was more to this story.\nAt this point, the youths who had walked here with Leonel couldn't help but cast weird and somewhat envious looks toward him. By now, it was obvious to them all that these two were fighting over him. Even the crowd who had been standing around couldn't help but cast a few more looks toward Leonel.\nGeneral Star? They were all aware of how prestigious such a title was. And, even if they weren't, Jarin's words were more than enough to explain it to them.\n\"Old witch, are you really trying to fight me for a General Star? This matter will definitely be brought to His Majesty's attention within the week! Is this really the battle you want to fight?!\"\n\"You understand nothing! Those bullshit captains know even less! They dare to give such a talent over to you block heads?! This young man could become a Three Star Magus given enough guidance and you're talking to me about a damned General Star?!\"\nJarin's expression flickered wildly.\nThere were indeed 31 General Stars. However, a Three Star Magus…? There were only 7 of them in the entire Kingdom. Their statuses were so high that only His Majesty himself could order those old fogies around.\nIf things were like this, it was obvious which had the higher standing. But, Jarin was still unwilling to give up.\nGeneral Stars weren't just born like talented mages were. General Stars usually awoke later in life after one had experienced many things. One as young as Leonel… If he ignored King Arthur, this would be a first in their history!\nHowever, Jarin was feeling incomparably aggrieved. How had the captains missed out on something like this?\nWait… How had even he missed it?\nSeeing the confusion on Jarin's face, Elys sneered.\n\"You fool. How could you muscle heads be worthy of seeing through his talent? His Spirit Pressure has already reached the standard of a Three Star Magus! He just hasn't learned how to control it yet!\"\nJarin grew ashen. Was such a thing really possible?!\n\"Dammit! Old witch! I'll definitely fight it out with you today!\"\nJarin unsheathed a broadsword to his side, not even pausing for a second as he slashed out toward Elys.\n\"Damned muscle brained bastards! You think I wasn't ready for you?!\"\nAn illusory aura surrounded Elys. Though Leonel was unaffected, the youths around him trembled, some of them even directly fainting.\nElys swept a glance over them and harrumphed. \"Trash.\"\nA wand appeared with a flick of Elys' palm. She drew a line in the air, sending a strike out toward Jarin's sword without a care in the world.\nThe result should have been obvious. A dainty woman holding something that looked like a tree branch. A big, hulking man swinging down a two-handed blade with all his strength. Which one came out on top was obvious… right?\nBANG!\nThe reality was completely out of expectations. Both Elys and Jarin took one step back before they both moved once more.\nJarin charged forward to gain a head of steam while Elys retreated with light footsteps, her wand waving in the air with an elegant cadence as she mumbled beneath her breath.\nLeonel's eyes shone. He was certain that what she was doing was invisible to most people, and even maybe invisible to Jarin, but he could see two Force Arts quickly forming to her back. At the same time, she sent out simple Force bullets to obstruct Jarin's path. All the while, she seemed calm and collected as though everything was in the palm of her fair hands.\nJarin caught Leonel's attention as well. His Force control was exceptional. Leonel could see that his whole blade was coated with Force, yet it was so tightly controlled that it was hardly perceptible even with Leonel's senses.\nThat wasn't all either. Jarin seemed capable of incorporating his Force into his every step, his every movement. There was nothing wasted and his actions carried a fluidity to them that could enrapture those with enough foresight. Though his actions seemed far less elegant than Elys' own, in Leonel's eyes, they both had the same amount of skill.\nTheir battle seemed fierce, their strength surpassing even what Leonel could do by a small margin. Yet, not only was there no destruction of property, even the people around seemed completely unaffected.\nThis was the true reason Leonel found them to be stronger than himself. This level of control… he most definitely didn't have it.\n\"Old witch!\"\n\"Muscle brained rogue!\"\n'Should I stop them… Or…?'\nLeonel was at a bit of a loss.\nJust when he was going to try and mediate, he suddenly felt two overwhelming auras converging onto this place.. They were powerful to the point Leonel's blood ran cold. From the instincts he gained from the primitive man, he could tell that he would have to put his life on the line to fight these two…",

      "content": "From the east, a towering figure leapt over several buildings, landing heavily on the ground. Cracks spread along the cobbled roads, but the figure didn't seem to notice as he bent his knees and launched himself into the air once again, bounding across hundreds of meters with every leap.\nFrom the west, a willowy figure fluttered through the air like a leaf. They swayed in the skies, making it seem like they just might fall from grace at any moment. Yet, they managed to keep a steady pace, heading toward their destination with a purpose in the deep oceans of their eyes.\nBANG!\nThe first figure landed heavily before the group of youths, causing the ground to quake. From their vantage point, he seemed so tall that he blotted out even the sun, casting a shadow over them all.\nHe wore silver armor accented with outlines and embroidery of red. It make him look like a raging flame even when he stood completely still.\nHe stood at almost seven feet tall. His jaw seemed sharp enough to cut grass and his eyes held a cold, murderous will within them that made those who got too close tremble uncontrollably.\nThe second figure fluttered to the ground slowly. It felt like even if there were fields of grass beneath his feet, they wouldn't even bend beneath his weight.\nHe wore deep maroon robes. His long hair rested against the small of his back, not a bit shorter than his long beard. Not only did they share the same obscene length, but they also shared the same snow white color to the point it was almost difficult to look at the man directly.\n\"Sir Lamorak!\"\n\"Magus Aliard!\"\nJalin and Elys came to grinding halt. It was obvious at a glance that they had called these two here, hoping to catch each other off guard. But, obviously, since they had both appeared, it seemed that neither had gained the upper hand once again. As such, even while they were greeting their superiors, they still sent sidelong glares toward one another.\nAliard smiled amiably, stroking his long beard. Compared to Lamorak, he was definitely several levels more approachable.\nHowever, those of the crowd nearly had a heart attack when they heard such titles.\nMagus Aliard? He was a Three Star Magus and one of the 7 most powerful mages of Camelot!\nSir Lamorak?… He was one of King Arthur's 12 knights!\nLeonel didn't know who Magus Aliard was. But, he had read enough fairy tales to know who Sir Lamorak was. At this point, even he felt that this situation was getting a bit out of control. He hadn't expected things to go this way at all.\nHe had spent so long planning his next moves before he made a decision, but at every turn it felt as though this Zone was the one pulling him by the nose.\nWhen these two got closer to him, he realized that his previous assessment had been too conservative. If he were to fight one of these two alone, even if he put his life on the line, his chance of living would be less than 10%! If it was both of them together, he could likely only wait for death!\nLeonel took a deep breath. He affirmed to himself once more that he needed to revise his power estimation system.\nBut, at the same time, he was confused. Elys had said that his Spirit Pressure was already at the standard of a Three Star Magus. He didn't know exactly what a Three Star Magus was, but he assumed that Spirit Pressure was this world's name for what he called spirit and his father called Soul Force.\nIf he really was at this standard already… why was it that he felt this Magus was an insurmountable mountain? He didn't have an aura anywhere near this imposing.\n\"Master, you mustn't let them take this boy! It'll be a big loss to the mage world!\"\nElys siezed the initiative and spoke first. She knew how domineering Sir Lamorak was. If he just directly snatched Leonel, there wouldn't be time for her to shed tears.\n\"Sir Lamorak! This boy is a General Star, we can't let him off!\"\nBefore Aliard could respond, Jarin spoke up as well, unwilling to give up either.\n\"Oh?\"\nThe two men looked toward Leonel for the first time.\nAt that moment, Leonel felt as though two mountains were weighing down on him. He could only feel aggrieved at this point. Was this really only an SS-grade Zone? Then what the hell would he have to go through in an SSS-grade Zone?\nHe had realized after fighting the beast kings that the divisions within the final three levels of a Dimension had massive leaps between them. If not for this, he wouldn't have thought he was battling an SS-grade threat when it was really just an Elite S-grade threat. But… this still felt a bit too exaggerated.\nAliard's calm, caring eyes gave way to shock after a moment. As for Lamorak, sensing a General Star wasn't as straight forward as sensing Spirit Pressure. But, he was still stunned by the strength hidden within Leonel's body.\nThough others couldn't tell, as an experienced knight of the round table, Lamorak could tell that the strength within Leonel's body wasn't very far from his own. In fact, he could feel a slight scent of threat coming from Leonel at the same time.\nWhen had their Kingdom gained such a talent?\nIt was then the atmosphere completely changed. Jarin and Elys had both thought that their respective masters would immediately begin contending over Leonel as well. What they could have never expected was for the temperature to suddenly drop by several degrees.\nLeonel's hair stood on end as he explosively retreated. He didn't even feel the slightest hint of safety even after he had placed ten meters worth of distance between him and the two men.\nNeither Lamorak or Aliard moved a single inch, but Leonel felt as though a guillotine was hanging over his neck, ready to fall at any moment.\n\"Who are you? Who sent you to my Camelot?\"\nLamorak's words caused a coldness to well up in Leonel's heart.",

      "content": "Leonel felt a heaviness on his chest. He suddenly found that it was several times more difficult to breathe as though all the oxygen in the air had been sucked away by some unknown force.\n\"Speak, boy.\" Lamorak's words grated against Leonel's ears, beating them like a drum. It felt like his head might explode if he listened too closely. \"Or else, I'll slaughter you where you stand.\"\nLamorak and Aliard were immediately on guard. A normal talent was always something to celebrate. But, if a talent was too monstrous, rather than being a joyous occasion, it would cross over and become something completely different.\nA body rivaling that of a knight of the round table? A Spirit Pressure rivaling that of a Three Star Magus?\nRather than truly believing that Leonel was such a genius, it made more sense to believe that he was a hidden evil with bad intentions. It was simply impossible for someone so young to have such ability. There had to be another explanation.\nLeonel's frown deepened. 'What the hell is wrong with me?'\nLeonel hadn't felt this way since the Mayan Tomb. This uncontrollable, insatiable fear that seemed to want to swallow him whole. He found it difficult even to calm his mind the slightest bit.\nAfter a moment, Leonel eyes focused on Aliard, his expression becoming even more serious. He didn't know exactly what was happening, but he had a strong feeling that it was the fault of this seemingly amiable man.\nThere was a slight glow in his eyes. It was nearly imperceptible, to the point even Leonel began to question himself. In that time, the fear he felt multiplied several times over, unwilling to relinquish the hold it had on his heart.\nLeonel turned his gaze back toward Lamorak, the goosebumps spreading rapidly across his skin without pause. He shook his head furiously, trying to calm his mind. But, he found it impossible to do so.\nThe frustration in his heart grew several levels greater and he began to feel an irrational anger. He didn't even really know where it came from.\nFor some reason, he kept having flashbacks of Jarin forcing them to fight to the death. Then, the scene of Elys calling the others trash simply because they couldn't withstand her Spirit Pressure ran through his mind.\nAll of the bad impressions he had of Camelot suddenly exploded forth hundreds of times over.\n\"Are you going to speak or not, boy?!\"\nLamorak's voice clapped like thunder in his mind, pushing Leonel over the edge.\n\"Piss off!\"\nLeonel suddenly roared, his voice piercing the veil and rampaging across Camelot. At that moment, Leonel's suppressed Force spread out in a tidal wave, causing billowing white steam to fill his surroundings.\nHis hair shot into the skies, the ink he had used to coat it vaporizing to reveal a blinding bronze sheen that shimmered no differently from polished metal.\nRunes uncontrollably appeared all across Leonel's skin. This was his true state. Without suppressing his Lineage Factor, these beautiful bronze runes radiating a royal violet color would uncontrollably cover his body.\nBeneath his weight, the cobbled roads cracked as he turned a pair of red eyes toward Lamorak. It was this annoying man who kept roaring at him, giving him such a splitting headache. It had truly infuriated him to the max.\nAn oppressive aura erupted from Leonel's body, bearing down on Camelot like an Emperor descending from the skies.\nThe Runes finally stopped spreading across Leonel's body. At that moment, he looked no different from a Roman God. His billowing hair, the bronze halo above his head, the crown drawn across his forehead… Even his eyes radiated a sharp light.\nAliard's expression changed. It wasn't just him, all those who had been around found it difficult to comprehend what was happening. At that moment, it felt as though a third heavy weight of Camelot had appeared, someone with no less strength than a Three Star Magus or a Knight of the Round Table.\n\"Boy! Do you think Camelot is a place you can act as you please?!\"\nBefore anyone could stop him, Lamorak had shot forward, a massive mace with a cylindrical head appearing in his hands. No, it wasn't a mace, it had no sharp points, it was a completely blunt weapon, carrying an impossibly heavy weight behind it.\nThis only served to infuriate Leonel more. As though he had lost his mind, he took a step forward and sent out a punch.\nThose watching paled. A fist against a heavy weapon like that? Even if they weren't fighters, the ending to such a thing should have been obvious.\nBANG!\nAnd, as expected, Leonel was sent flying. His body shot out like a broken kite, crashing through the buildings of the inner city without regard.\nAt this point, Jarin and Elys could finally grasp what was happening and their faces slightly paled. If they had really allowed such a spy into Camelot, the consequences would ahve been disastrous. Ironically, they could only look toward one another with gratitude. If it wasn't for the other battling with them for Leonel, they wouldn't have been forced to call their master's here and this matter wouldn't have been exposed so soon.\nAs for giving Leonel a chance, they believed they had seen all they needed to see.\nThough they didn't know what those Runes on Leonel's body were, they knew that such a thing had never appeared in Camelot before and as such had a high likelihood of originating from an outside place. In this land, there were only two factions. Camelot and Modred's Demon Army. If Leonel wasn't from the former, he was obviously from the latter.\nPlus, on top of that, they had all seen how Leonel's hair color was hidden from them. What reason would he have to hide such a thing if not to cover up something?\nLuckily, this was over. They could only hope that their masters didn't blame them too much. After all, wasn't this still a merit? If not for them, who knew how far this spy would have risen up?\nWho knew that at that very moment, the very Leonel that should have already been dead with walk out from within a pile of wreckage, blood leaking from his lips…?\nAt that point, let alone the crowd, Lamorak was especially stunned. At the same time, he grew several levels more serious. This threat… had to be eliminated.\nA mighty roar left the knight's lips, his Force billowing around him. But, unlike Leonel's which manifested like an uncontrolled geyser, his was compressed to the point of even carrying a faint red color.\n\"Die!\"",

      "content": "Leonel shoved off a massive slab of building off of him. Finally, it seemed that his eyes showed a bit of clarity, likely due to the thumping pain in his arm currently.\nHis right hand wasn't a mass of bloody flesh as one might expect, but it wasn't that far off either. His bones managed to survive the ordeal with a few fractures, but the skin on his knuckles was completely obliterated. It could be said that for a normal human, this arm could be considered useless for the foreseeable future. But Leonel was able to ignore it somewhat at his current stage.\nUnfortunately, he didn't have the luxury of dwelling on this for any decent period of time because Lamorak was already charging toward him, his lumbering figure causing the ground to shake.\nLeonel's expression turned cold.\nSomeone was playing with his mind. He wasn't one to lose his temper easily. Something like flying into a rage like he just had wasn't something he would do under normal circumstances.\nBy now, Leonel was certain that his actions were related to Aliard. It seemed that the magic system of this Mythological Zone was even more troublesome to deal with than he had thought originally.\nBut, now that he had recovered, he wouldn't allow his mind to be affected as easily again.\n'Since you want to fight, let's fight.'\nLeonel's palm flipped, causing his pointed spear to appear in his hand.\nHe had already decided. His priority was running from this place, but he had to find an opportunity. It took time to sink into the earth and escape. Now that he thought about it, the best chance was while he was still beneath the pile of rubble, but his mind had still been clouded then.\n'I'll use this battle to scale the strength of these knights and probe what other abilities their so-called Three Star Magi have. Then, I'll get sent flying again and use that chance to escape through the earth.'\nAfter Leonel came to this conclusion, he chose to hide some of his strength. Since his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor was exposed, there was no helping it. But, he could still keep his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor a secret. LIke this, he would still have some trump cards in the future.\nLamorak's expression grew several levels more serious when he saw Leonel's spear appear. At the same time, he became even more certain that Leonel had something to hide.\nHe too was able to take out his weapon from thin air, but this wasn't something a supposed commoner should be able to do. It was becoming more and more obvious that Leonel had something to hide.\nHowever, he was still feeling confident. He had seen through Leonel's strength after their first exchange. Aside from a strong physical defense, his strength was a few notches below his own and his combat sense was even weaker. At least… that was what he thought initially.\nAfter Leonel's eyes regained their calm, he took a forceful step forward that sent his battle intent soaring through the skies. It was to the point that even Lamorak himself was somewhat suppressed.\nLeonel's spear pierced forward thrice in quick succession, sending curving arcs of wind toward the hulking knight.\nLamorak shattered them all with a forceful swing of his spikeless mace, but his steps were still paused, allowing Leonel to take another forceful step forward, sending out several more piercing strikes.\nLeonel knew that his spear would snap after just a single exchange with Lamorak's mace, so how could he allow such a thing to happen.\nHe continuously cast [Call of the Wind] toward Lamorak's vitals, his cold calculating gaze seeing two, three, even four steps ahead.\nIt was only at that moment that the crowd came to a shocking realization of what was happening. One of the 12 Knight of the Round Table was being… suppressed?\nOnly Leonel and Lamorak knew that this wasn't exactly the case. At most, Leonel was like an annoying fly, constantly pestering the latter and keeping him from being able to exert his full strength.\nHONG!\nLeonel took another step forward. At that moment, Lamorak felt his arm sink. Due to the sudden change, he couldn't react in time and one of Leonel's piercing strikes found its way through the chinks in his armor, causing the hulking brute to finally bleed.\n'The gravity field is only 1.1x, but it's enough for a sudden change of pace…'\nLeonel's eyes narrowed.\nWhile Lamorak was unable to use his full strength, neither was Leonel. Not only was he holding back some trump cards, but he also had to continuously monitor Aliard. However, he was so focused on protecting his life that he didn't even notice the utter silence that had fallen over the inner city. They couldn't believe their eyes.\nStill, despite the fact he had been injured, Lamorak didn't seem to care. In fact, he seemed completely unaffected.\n\"It seems I will have to use my true strength. I've underestimated you.\"\nLamorak suddenly stopped defending completely. Or rather, he stopped moving entirely. Yet, even when Leonel sent out more [Call of Wind] strikes, trying to keep his distance, they completely shattered before even entering a one meter radius of the hulking knight.\nLamorak's Force began to flicker with a wild brilliance, condensing into a red, raging flame. Yet, Leonel could tell that this wasn't Fire Elemental Force. It was something completely different. It didn't have any heat to it, nor did the temperature rise.\nHis Force took a tangible form, fluttering around his body and causing an oppressive pressure to flood over the battlefield.\nBANG!\nThe stone beneath Lamorak's feet shattered as he shot forward.\nLeonel shot back, his brow slightly furrowed. But, no matter how many strikes he sent forward, he couldn't break through the barrier around Lamorak at all.\nAt that moment, Leonel's steps gained an enigmatic rhythm to them. He seemed to lead himself into a corner, only to just barely slip out and flip the positions of both himself and Lamorak.\nHis light steps were in complete opposition to Lamorak's own heavy stomps, making their battle seem like one of a giant versus an ant.\n\"General Star?\"\nLamorak remained expressionless. He had already heard Jarin say that Leonel had such a thing. But.. Didn't he as well? In fact, compared to Leonel's own, it was like comparing a grown man to a child just learning to walk. The difference was even more exaggerated since Leonel's Runes made his body heavier than he was equipped to handle.\nJust when Leonel wanted to trick Lamorak with his steps again, he found a swinging mace he couldn't avoid at all in his way. In fact, to an outside observer, it seemed as though he had walked into it of his own volition.\nBANG!",

      "content": "Leonel felt as though all the bones in his body were shattering. He had never been hit by a truck before, but he assumed that this was about as close as he could get to the real thing.\nHis body curved grotesquely around Lamorak's spikeless, cylindrical mace almost like a ball deforming around a baseball bat. Then, in the blink of an eye, he was sent flying.\nOr rather… he thought that was what would happen. But, reality was cruel.\nIn the single step Lamorak had taken to send a blow toward Leonel, the ground beneath his feet caved downward before jetting up a large broken piece. Before Leonel could fly very far to the side, he hit this broken piece first, causing his already bent body to crash the other way.\nIn the end, as though it was all planned out beforehand, Leonel fell right before Lamorak, the glint in his eyes slowly growing dim.\nLeonel's world began to spin. He didn't have the presence of mind to maintain his ability any longer. It felt as though everything was fading. The pain was truly too much.\nHis thoughts were in complete disarray. He only caught onto the faintest inkling of something that made him shocked to the point of speechlessness.\nEvery step Lamorak had taken before had caused a crack on the ground. Then, during his last attack, his final step managed to kick up a large slab of stone that stopped Leonel from flying away. However, according to Leonel's calculations, that should have been impossible unless… the previous steps drew the outline of the stone slab he eventually kicked up.\nIf this was true, Leonel could only admit that he was entirely outclassed. His ability was perfectly suited for this kind of planned battle, yet he still lost so resoundingly. Weren't big brutes like Lamorak supposed to be simple minded?\nLeonel felt his consciousness fading.\nThe last time he felt this kind of pain, it was while he was opening his bloodline shackles. But, at least that had some sort of reward at the end. This was just unbridled, unconcealed, and unrestrained pain.\nSuddenly, the sound of whistling wind shook Leonel awake. He didn't need to look up to know that it was Lamorak's heavy mace swinging down toward him.\nAs a man of the battlefield, Lamorak didn't feel the need to say anything after siezing victory. There was no room for trash talk or disdaining the enemy in such a situation. Those who did things like this usually didn't last very long.\nIt could be said that this was the first time Leonel felt that death was so close. Not that there was just a threat of it, but in just a few more moments, he would experience what it felt like to have his life snatched from him.\nIn the Mayan Tomb, he almost died at the hands of the sacrifical virgin, but that was a choice he, himself had made. He had found it too difficult to take the life of an innocent teenage girl. Compared to this situation where the choice wasn't in his hands at all, it was completely different.\n'This feeling… sucks…'\nLeonel hadn't ever felt such a wave of helplessness before.\n'I don't like it…'\nLeonel tried to move, a strong will pulling his body together as he tumbled to one side, just barely avoiding Lamorak's fatal strike. However, the air pressure alone made him feel as though his body was collapsing.\nShattered bits of dirt and stone were flung on his body, sending him sliding to the side.\nLeonel grasped out for his spear, only to realize it was nowhere to be found. It must have flown out of his hand during that last barrage. What a joke, he hadn't even felt it leave his grasp. Had he been a true spearman, he would likely rather die than reliquish his weapon so easily, but it seemed he hadn't reached such a stage yet.\nLamorak raised an eyebrow. He had only missed because according to his own calculative abilities, Leonel should have been too injured to move at all. Something like this was outside his expectations.\nHowever… he wouldn't miss again.\nBANG!\nLeonel was hit squarely on the head. The ground he was trying to pull himself up from shattered and formed a small crater.\nLamorak had thought that this would be enough, but his brows furrowed once more. He faintly noticed Leonel take out a weird… fish scale? That scale formed a shield that just as quickly collapsed under his might. It was likely this that had saved Leonel's life this time.\nLamorak began to feel a slight discomfort in his chest. With his experience, he knew that if he let things go on like this, one or two coincidences might snowball into three or four. Eventually, the situation would get out of hand and leave his scope of ability to handle.\nHis aura surged, the billowing red Force around him surging up to another level. This time, he wouldn't swing casually. He really would go all out.\nA roar billowed out. Despite the fact it came from his mouth, it felt as though it projected out from his chest. His torso swelled, concentric circles of concentrated wind jetting out from his lips. It was so deafening that it made it difficult to tell whether or not the roar came from a man, or a beast.\nBANG!\nLeonel scrambled to activate two fish scales as the cylindrical mace descended once more. He still had many remaining since he hadn't ended up needing them for the Force Crystal Core. But, it somehow felt that no matter how many he brought out, it still wouldn't matter. Lamorak had an undeniable will. Even if he had to flatten a mountain or split the oceans, he would do it.\nAn overwhelming strength came down from above. The two Force Skins Leonel formed barely held up for a split moment before shattering like broken glass.\nThe mace crashed into his body, causing the small crater to expand a fold in size.\nThe cracks along the cobble stone streets spread out toward the various shops on the side, causing some of them to collapse on their foundations.\nLeonel's chest caved inward, his face becoming badly distorted. When Lamorak lifted his mace once more, there was nothing but a mangled mess.. With how much blood there was, it was difficult to even differentiate the features of a normal human body.",

      "content": "Leonel's mind went blank. Was he really going to die here?\nHe was unwilling. Even more unwilling than he felt when his bloodline shackles tried to force him to take a step back. He was continuously roaring in his heart.\nHowever, his body was really in no state to move. No matter how unwilling he was, there was a limit to what will could accomplish.\n'He's still alive?' Lamorak raised an eyebrow.\nHe still didn't manage to kill Leonel after going all out like this?\nJust when he wanted to swing again, though, a voice suddenly called out to stop him.\n\"Hold on, Sir Lamorak. There's still some value in questioning this young man, don't you think?\"\n\"Questioning him? For what, exactly?\"\n\"Don't you think there are still some odd points about this? If he really was a spy, his actions are a bit too odd. Plus, I'm sure you know it's not possible for our Camelot to not have a single spy within it, right? With such a high value spy like this young man, why would he come here on his own instead of relying on one of those connections to establish a footing first?\"\nLamorak felt that Aliard's words made sense.\nIf he thought about it, the reason he was so hostile to Leonel was because of his weird actions. The moment they began to question him, he suddenly became defensive and even jumped back, broadening a ten meter radius between them.\nAt that moment, he had already assumed Leonel to be a spy. But, from another angle, would a real spy really act so obviously?\nLamorak frowned. But in the end, his gaze turned resolute as he raised his mace once more.\n\"Sir Lamorak, what are you doing?\"\n\"While there are some suspicious points, there are even more points in favor of him being a spy. Your [Paranoia Fog] spell forces one to reveal their inner thoughts. It's clear that not only is this young man hiding something, but judging by his initial reaction, he's also hiding a bestial aura within his usually calm demeanor.\n\"With this kind of attitude, he isn't a person who forgives easily. Even if he doesn't retaliate, his heart will never be with Camelot. This will be something Modred can exploit.\n\"Such a person. It's better that he dies.\"\nLeonel didn't hear any of these words. Even if he wanted to, the pain was too unbearable.\nLeonel subconsciously escaped into his Dream World. He was pleasantly surprised to find that the pain lessened when he did so. It wasn't that his body had healed, but rather that it took a lot of his mental faculties to enter this space. So, his other senses were dulled.\nLeonel had thoughts of just staying here to the end. Maybe death would be less painful in this way.\nHowever, that familiar unwillingness swelled in his heart.\nHe really did hate this feeling. He couldn't explain why he hated it so much, either. It wasn't as simple as him not liking pain. At the same time, it wasn't like Lamorak was a horrible person. He was only doing what he thought was right. He also didn't look down on Leonel, nor did he disdain his existence.\nAll this being said, Leonel still hated this. He hated it so much that even with all the pain ravaging his body, he still had emotions to spare for fury.\nBut, what good was that? Fury wouldn't do him any good. If anything, it would probably speed up his death.\n'I need… to get up…'\nDespite having these thoughts, what good were they? Wanting to get up and being able to were two completely different concepts. No amount of will could mend his bones and flesh. His body was a complete mess.\nIn truth, the fact that he had any consciousness to speak of was shocking enough. Maybe if his spirit wasn't so great, his thoughts would have already faded.\nLeonel's mind drifted, looking toward the large, complicated Dream Sculpt hanging in the air above him. It looked like a maze of golden and silver lines. If one had to explain it in just a few words, it would be like if one created a complex network of tunnels beneath a planet's surface, then took everything away but the tunnels themselves.\nIn truth, it was incomplete. This Dream Sculpt was none other than the Natural Force Art? of the Force Crystal Mine Core. It was about 99% to completion, but that final percentage point felt like an insurmountable mountain to Leonel. He felt that even if he spent years meditating on it, it wouldn't do him any good.\nLeonel fell into a trance staring toward the Natural Force Art before he realized what was happening. This always seemed to happen when he looked at this Dream Sculpt. He wasn't sure why it was it happened, but all he knew was that falling into this trance lessened his pain even more, it almost felt somewhat refreshing.\nIn the outside world, Lamorak's mace reached its apex.\nAliard sighed and shook his head. He didn't feel that it was worth it to have a clash of ideologies with a Knight of the Round Table over someone as insignificant as Leonel. Plus, the words he spoke were true. There was nothing wrong with his analysis.\nHowever, just as Lamorak was about to swing downward just one more time, the fourth coincidence he had been battling against seemed to occur.\nAt first, Leonel was nothing but a bloody mess. But in the next instant, a boundless light suddenly radiated out from his body. It was as though the light wanted to pierce the skies above. Its presence alone made the few clouds disperse, tearing them apart into rippling waves.\nLamorak froze, as did Aliard and the rest.\nThe light didn't last for long. It also didn't come with an oppressive, unbridled aura. It was actually quite gentle, gentle to the point many somehow felt tears welling in their eyes. There chests were overwhelmed by feelings of love and care, yet none of them could grasp where this feeling was coming from.\nAt that moment, Leonel's body was finally visible once again. It was still the same, bloodied mess. But, there were odd, fluttering white feathers falling around him like gentle drops of rain.\nEach of the white feathers looked pure beyond belief, radiating a gentle golden light as they fell onto Leonel's body one after another.\nUnder the shocked eyes of the spectators, as every feather fell, the wounds on Leonel's body seemed to slowly close as well… However, with such a slow pace… How could there possibly be enough time to recover before Lamorak's mace fell?",

Underestimating this boy could only end poorly. The only way to ensure that nothing else unexpected occurred would be to kill him now.\nAfter reaching such a conclusion, his aura surged once more, his power entering his spikeless, cynlindrical mace as he powered a strike downward.\n\"Holy Son!\"\nElys' sudden shocked cry shook the inner city.\n\"Sir Lamorak, please stay your hand!\"\nLamorak didn't seem to hear anything, but it was at this point that Aliard moved. Just when his mace was about to kill Leonel, the frail old man appeared before the knight, a wand faintly glowing in his hand.\nA muffled boom sounded.\nAliard's maroon robes fluttered wildly under the wind pressure, but his supposedly fragile figure didn't bend. In fact, under the shocked gazes of everyone, his thin wand completely stopped Lamorak's massive mace in its tracks.\nLamorak frowned. \"What are you doing, Magus Aliard?\"\nAliard send a complicated gaze toward Leonel before turning back toward Lamorak.\n\"You cannot kill him.\"\nCompared to before, there wasn't an ounce of leeway in his words. It seemed that no matter what Lamorak said this time, it wouldn't matter in the slightest. Aliard had already resolved himself to protect Leonel.\nLamorak's frown deepened. \"Give me an explanation.\"\nHis voice came out hoarse. No one doubted that if Aliard's words weren't convincing enough, the great knight truly wouldn't have a problem with starting a battle here and now. Compared to the safety of Camelot, he didn't mind falling out with even a Three Star Magus if he deemed it necessary.\n\"You should have already heard it. He is our Holy Son. What other explanations do you need?\"\nLamorak slowly lowered his mace. It seemed that he wouldn't be able to do what he wanted to do today. He had indeed heard Elys' words, but he had completely ignored them. It was impossible to tell whether he knew their significance or not, or if he simply knew of it and still didn't care.\nAt that moment, a whole host of city guards began to make their way forward. These events seemed to have taken a long time, but it was truly no more than a few minutes since the battle began. Coupling that with the fact the inner city usually didn't need much policing and it was no surprise that it took so long for officials to make their way here.\nHowever, by the time they did, it was all already over.\n**\nLeonel startled awake.\nHis first thought was that he had died and ascended to some higher world controlled by a greater power. It truly wasn't his fault for thinking this either.\nFor one, he had been in a life or death situation. And secondly… he couldn't describe the place he was currently in by any other means.\nEverything was either in white or gold. Even the bed sheets that covered him were embroidered with real gold sheets. With his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, it was simple for Leonel to tell that this was in fact real metal.\nDespite the fact that everything was woven by such bright colors, the room itself wasn't hard on the eyes. Everything gave off a warm light that made it more comfortable than grating. It was precisely the kind of place one would expect 'Heaven' to resemble.\nHowever, these thoughts didn't last long because when Leonel awoke, the large doors to his current room were opened. It was only now he realized just how tall the entryway was. He didn't understand why a bedroom needed doors with a height of over five meters.\nAfter he got over the oddity of the doors, Leonel was shocked to find that the one who entered was … Elys?\nHe very much doubted that she died along with him. Plus, if this was his Heaven, the woman who came in should definitely be Aina, not this woman he barely caught a glimpse of beneath her massive, pointed hat.\nThis time, though, Elys had taken off her large hat, revealing quite some delicate features. She looked like a girl of no more than 16 years of age. But, remembering that Jarin had called her an old hag multiple times, he felt that there was more to this story.\nWhen Elys saw Leonel looking at her so intently, she blushed profusely, forgetting what she had come for. The tray of water and fruits she had come in with clattered under her nervouseness, shaking along with her trembling hands.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. What was wrong with this woman? She didn't seem like the type to act like this. In fact, she had quite the foul mouth from what he remembered. Plus, it wasn't like he was handsome enough to cause such a reaction.\nAs for Flowing Wind's words on his attractiveness? He never took it very seriously. She was just the type to say such things.\nHad Flowing Wind been here, she would have definitely felt aggrieved. She was very selective with her compliments. Even before the Metamorphosis, Leonel was fairly attractive. At least considered within a top percentile of men.\nAfter the Metamorphosis, not much changed. Until, that is… he awakened his Lineage Factors. He already had the appearance of a Roman God after touching upon his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor. But, what he didn't know was that while he was unconscious, he had unshackled the Healing Sub Branch of his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor.\nThis had not only saved his life in an unexpected way, but it had also given him an added charm.\nOf course, this alone wasn't the reason Elys was acting in this way. Leonel's charm was one thing, but the legends behind his ability were something completely different.\nAfter a while, Elys finally settled herself beneath Leonel's gaze and set the tray down.\nHer long, slender fingers played with the fabric of her dark blue robes.\n\"Holy Son, would you like me to serve you?\"\nLeonel's expression turned weird while Elys seemed to become a ripe tomato.\nIt was only after a while Leonel realized she was making weird assumptions because of his gaze.\n\"Holy Son…? What is that?\" Leonel asked with a weird expression.\nElys blinked. Seemingly realizing that she had misunderstood something, she reddened even more.\n\"The Holy Son is you, of course.\"\n\"Me? How am I your Holy Son?\"\nLeonel's expression became weirder.\n\"That's of course because Holy Son can Spirit Crystalize the Light Element. Had we known this before, we would have never treated Holy Son as such…\"\nElys bowed in apology, causing Leonel to not know what to say.\nHe had always thought that the so-called light versus darkness cliche was utter nonsense. But, he had completely forgotten that this was a Mythological Zone. This was exactly the kind of place those cliches and legends came from....",

      "content": "After listening to Elys, Leonel came to understand a bit more about his situation.\n'It's no wonder they immediately threw out the idea of me being a spy…'\nAccording to Elys, Modred and her Demon Army were harbingers of darkness. Though Leonel wasn't certain if this meant that they could utilize Dark Elemental Force, what he did know was that the people of Camelot believed that someone who could utilize the Light Element was an inherently good person.\nToward this, Leonel was a bit speechless, but he couldn't blame them. After all, if the main enemy you fought for a lifetime was one of darkness, you had good reason to assume such things.\n\"What is Spirit Crystallization?\"\nFor such questions, there was no point in asking the dictionary about them. This was an entirely new magic system from what Leonel understood. As such, though the dictionary could make speculations, it wasn't possible to understand it in detail.\nThis experience would teach Leonel something very important about the universe. Tales of fiction tended to have just one power system that ruled over all others, but this wasn't how the real world worked.\nWithin the universe, there were countless systems of powers and new ones were being created all the time. Even though many of them had the same ends, they all approached it differently.\nSome magic systems could reach the pinnacle, others were lacking a bit, and yet others were lacking a lot. Whether Camelot's system fit into the first category or one of the latter didn't truly matter much to Leonel right now. All he knew was that they were more powerful than his current self. So, at least for now, their techniques were worth learning.\nAs long as it wouldn't badly influence his future path in a more properly vetted magic system, Leonel wouldn't mind trying out everything they had to offer.\n\"Ah…\" Elys seemed to realize that Leonel really didn't know much of anything. It made her feel embarrassed that they had thought of him as a spy. \"… Spirit Pressure is used to Crystallize the Elements. Mages are born with differing affinities depending on several factors.\n\"Most often, affinities are inherited from one's parents. If two mages have a child together, there is normally a 20% chance there child will also be a mage. If those mages are more powerful, the chance is even higher. But, it will also be more difficult for them to have children.\n\"If the parents share an affinity, the likelihood is even higher. For example, if both parents are Water Elemental Mages, the chances are closer to 50%. In addition, their child will also have an even higher affinity for the Water Element in comparison to their parents.\n\"Ah, sorry, I got off topic…\"\nRealizing that she had been talking about the mating patterns of mages, she blushed profusely once again.\nLeonel smiled and didn't mind. After the overly straightforward answers he was used to receiving from the dictionary, this was actually a nice change of pace.\n\"The other method is what I'm sure happened to Holy Son. This could just be considered a blessing of the skies. Spontaneous birth of mages like you are ironically more common.\"\nLeonel nodded, hiding his peculiar expression.\nHe gained his Light Elemental Force from his mother's side. So, he wasn't in the category Elys spoke of at all. But, he had told Heckle that he was an orphan, so Elys was probably tactfully tiptoeing around this.\nSince it was better to continue allowing her to think this way, Leonel didn't correct her. Plus, in his opinion, his mother wasn't truly his mother regardless. He didn't even have the faintest memory of her. There was a reason he had hardly reacted when his father told him she was still alive.\nWas it resentment? Leonel didn't think so. He couldn't remember ever missing his mother, but that was mostly due to him not really experiencing what it felt like to have one. Leonel would categorize it more as indifference.\nIf he thought about it, maybe he was the weird one for feeling such a way…\n\"What do you all want to do with me?\"\nFinally, Leonel couldn't help but ask this question. After satisfying his basal curiosity, he realized that there were more important matters at hand. He felt that it would be a bit too naive of him to assume that everything would be fine now just because of this.\nHowever, after hearing Elys' response, he realized he had still underestimated the value of the Light Element in this world. Had he known this, rather than getting beaten into almost becoming a corpse, he would have directly used his Light Elemental Force instead of trying to hide it as a future trump card.\n\"Of course, Holy Son will receive the same treatment as other Holy Sons. You will be allowed to enter the Mage Academy with high standing and receive all the rewards that come with this. We hope that you'll become a pillar of Camelot in the future.\"\nLeonel raised his brows. \"There are others besides me?\"\n\"Yes, yes. There are three others.\" A hint of worship flashed within Elys' eyes. \"One is His Majesty, King Arthur. The second is Three Star Magus Orian. The last is the First Son of the Mage Academy, Sir Lionus. He is the son of His Majesty and is also walking the same path, that of the Magus Swordsman!\"\nSeeing Elys fangirling, Leonel didn't really have the heart to stop her ranting. He could only listen on as she rambled on and on about these three Holy Sons. At some point, he tuned her out completely and retreated to his own thoughts.\n'Interesting… According to legends, Arthur had a bastard son by the name of Modred. But, in this place, Modred is a woman. In addition, it seems that his publicly acknowledged son is also the child of his Queen, Guinevere.'\nThinking to this point, Leonel's expression became a bit weird. He suddenly remembered that one of the side quests of this Zone was to repair King Arthur's relationship with Lancelot. And, the dictionary made it quite clear that this was related to Queen Guinevere.\nLeonel felt another headache coming on.. He really hoped that Lionus was Arthur's son. If it turned out he was Lancelot's son, this matter would only get more complicated…",

      "content": "Leonel was a person who was used to having many eyes on him. But, even he was starting to get a bit antsy.\nThe halls of the Mage Academy could be considered to be quite narrow. Well, not narrow by normal human standards. After all, they were still tens of meters across in width. The reason why they felt narrow was because their ceilings were just that tall.\nThey loomed overhead with majestic archways, containing windows just as tall and grandiose.\nUnfortunately, with this large size came an equally large amount of people.\nNormally, it shouldn't be possible for so many to know of Leonel already. After all, this was ultimately a medieval era Zone. There was no social media, nor were there any cameras. Due to this, Leonel should have been free from such troubles….\nHowever, what he didn't expect was that the robes Elys had given him to wear would be so eyecatching.\nFrom what Leonel knew, the mages of this world were split into nine grades. One to Three Star Apprentice Mage, One to Three Star Official Mage, and finally, One to Three Star Magus.\nFor each of these rankings, one would be assigned a different color robe. An Apprentice Mage would wear grey robes. An Official Mage would wear blue robes. And, a Magus would wear purple robes.\nThe stages of One to Three Star would be separated by the darkness of the color. A One Star Apprentice Mage would have robes that were nearly white, while a Three Star of the same kind would have robes that were nearly black.\nFrom this, it should be clear that Elys was a Three Star Official Mage, and was very nearly a One Star Magus.\nHowever, none of this was the real reason Leonel was being stared at like some sort of lab rat.\nUsually, aside from the main color of one's robes, there would also be embroidery that exposed one's mage branch. Fire Mages would have touches of red, Water Mages touches of blue, etc…\nKnowing this, it was no wonder everyone couldn't take their eyes off of Leonel. He was wearing gold embroidered robes that only three others in the whole of Camelot were allowed to wear.\nSeeing his pale grey robes embroidered with gold was just one aspect, but the following connection they made between him and the rumors of the teenage boy who battled a Knight of the Round Table was what really set the environment ablaze.\nThe fact Leonel lost didn't dampen his prestige in the slightest. Not only was Lamorak one of those legendary 12 knights, but he was also within the top 3 strongest among them. Leonel losing was a foregone fact. It was the fact he managed to survive at all that garnered so much respect.\n\"Alright, alright. Clear the way.\"\nElys became a cross between a jealous girlfriend and a valiant bodyguard, clearing a path for Leonel forward. Luckily, she had been tasked with being his guide, or else with how large this Academy was, Leonel would probably be spinning in circles for a while.\nThough he could release his Internal Sight, he was told by Elys that this action was rude, so he could only take a step back.\nAt the same time, though, he was confused.\n'By my estimations, a One Star Mage is the equivalent of someone who has opened just one Force Node. A Three Star Magus should be the equivalent of someone who has opened nine Force Nodes. But…'\nThere were too many things Leonel had questions about.\nFor one, he had already opened eight Nodes. Not only had he done so, but his Nodes were much larger than a normal person's. By right, he shouldn't have lost so badly to Lamorak who was the knight equivalent of a Three Star Magus — A Three Star Grand Knight.\nSecondly, Elys had said his Spirit Pressure was the equivalent of a Three Star Magus', but this shouldn't have been true either. His spirit should be at the peak of the Fifth Dimension. Let alone a Three Star Magus, even a thousand of them shouldn't have been able to match up to his Spirit Pressure.\nThere was definitely something weird going on. Leonel was lacking in a way he couldn't put his finger on.\nBut, there was a burning fire within his chest. He had had this uncomfortable feeling within his heart the moment he awoke. He had never felt such agitation in his life before and he found it hard to describe.\nAll he knew was that unless he could defeat Lamorak, he would never feel at ease.\nElys led Leonel to a classroom he was embarrassed to find was filled with 12-13 year old kids. Luckily, there were a few who were closer to him in age, but they were all seated at the back. It was clear their standing was much lower than that of the younger kids.\nElys walked to the front. Surprisingly, she was the lecturer for this class.\nLeonel chuckled and shook his head, his embarrassment fading. He was never an overly proud person to begin with, at least not for meaningless matters like this. Of course, if others knew he was thinking this, who knows how they'd react.\nIt wasn't long before he had sat near the front and forgot about everything around him.\nUnfortunately… his bad habit flared up again. An oppressive aura filled the classroom as Leonel began to focus. Many of the small children burst into tears, but didn't dare to make a sound, fearful that they would anger Leonel.\nLeonel was so focused on Elys' words that he didn't notice the oddities around him. This was always how he was in class. There was a reason everyone always waited for him to finish his tests and exams before they began. The only one that had always been unaffected was Aina.\nElys smiled bitterly, but she seemingly realized that Leonel wasn't doing this on purpose, so she could only continue. Still, it was safe to say tthat this woulud be the last time she allowed Leonel into this class. These poor children couldn't learn in such an environment.\n\"Now, Spirit Crystallization…\"",

      "content": "[Schedule will be changing. Updates will be at 10pm EST from now on.]\nHours later, Leonel found himself in a library.\nLeonel wasn't very used to normal books. By the time his era came around on Earth, such things had been completely fazed out. So, seeing the towering bookcases one could only use ladders to reach the top of, he felt a deep sense of awe.\nThe scent alone made his heart reach a state of calmness. He had never understood when he read about those who said there was nothing that could compare to a book one could flip through — his father being among them — but now he gained a small inkling.\nThe Mage Academy's library had many ledges and oddly placed staircases all around. Sometimes, the highest shelves of the obscenely tall bookcases could only be reached by climbing these stairs.\nOne of Leonel's privileges as a Holy Son was the ability to access information beyond his mage level. Usually, as a One Star Apprentice Mage, he would only be allowed to touch upon Level One Knowledge. But, he was allowed to read up to Level Four Knowledge.\nAs long as he was within the Mage Academy, it wouldn't be an issue to read books three levels above his own.\nLeonel didn't mind this. He didn't expect to spend very long as a One Star Apprentice Mage. He wouldn't be surprised if it only took a few months to become a Three Star Magus.\nIgnoring all the glances he received walking into the library, Leonel immediately picked out as many foundation knowledge books he could find. These were books so common that this library had several hundred copies of each so that those who needed them could always have one available.\n'Foundational Crystallization'. 'Importance of Affinity'. 'Foundations of Magic Art Formation'. 'A Mage and His Spiritual Wood'. 'Breaking Through: The Ascension of Tiers'.\nIt wasn't long before Leonel's spatial bracelet was filled to the brim. Since Elys had all but kicked him out of her class, he could only study on his own. Plus, he somewhat preferred it this way. If he followed the normal study plan of the Academy, it would take at least five years to graduate, and even then, he would only be an Official Mage.\nHe didn't forget that he was still on a time crunch. This was a Zone, not a vacation spot.\nHowever, Leonel was confident in himself. If this was only a matter of knowledge and gaining it, no one should be able to compare to him.\nLeonel sat at a normal oak table and pulled out his first book.\n'I have to find ways to use my ability more efficiently…'\nLeonel's eyes narrowed for a brief moment. He didn't forget the shock Simeon had given him. He had been able to evolve his ability to the point gene manipulation had become a method of beast taming. This taught Leonel that he was relying too much on his ability to spontaneously evolve, he had to also come up with methods of improving it as well.\n'I'll call this ability… Dreamscape.'\nEvolving one's ability wasn't always about forming some completely new power. Sometimes, it was as simple as using the abilities you already have more cleverly.\nLeonel wanted Dreamscape to become like a databank in his mind. He saw it as a fusion of his Dream Sculpt and Dream World.\nWhat separated truly intelligent people wasn't always about knowledge. If two students were always attentive in class, they would of course have access to the same knowledge. So, why was it that even if they tried equally as hard, one person might ace the class, while the other might only receive an above average grade?\nThe difference wasn't knowledge, but in how one was able to apply it.\nIntelligent people can have access to the same knowledge, but are unique in the way they use that knowledge. They see things the less intelligent can't see, connect dots a normal student never would. This allows them the ability to solve problems with the same tools someone else would fail with.\nLeonel wanted his Dreamscape ability to supercharge his intelligence in the same fashion.\nThe way it worked was simple. First, he would save something into his 'database' using Dream Sculpt. With Dream Sculpt's ability to create a perfect memory of anything, he wouldn't have to worry about ever forgetting it.\nFollowing this, he would fuse the Dream Sculpt into his Dream World. This would place his Dream Sculpt into his world of simulation. This was where the true fearsomeness of this ability would come into play.\nLet's say Leonel added this book in his hand to his Dreamscape. This book was titled 'Friend of Light'. From Leonel's understanding after reading its summary, it was a book detailing the strengths and weaknesses of the Light Element, when it was most powerful, how best to absorb it and manipulate it, etc.\nNow, if Leonel continued on to want to learn what this world called a 'Magic Art' and it happened to be one of the Light Element, the information he gained from Friend of Light would subconsciously meld into his thoughts, helping him to comprehend the intricacies of the Magic Art with much greater speed.\nThis was just the simplest example. What if Leonel instead added dozens, hundreds or even thousands of Force Arts to his Dreamscape? Would he be able to see the patterns between them, see through the unique quirks, and even become capable of modifying and creating new Force Arts using this method?\nAnd what if he added just as many blueprints to his Dreamscape? If he had all sorts of Force Crafts floating in his mind, wouldn't he be able to optimize his crafts by compiling the strengths and weaknesses of many?\nThis was what he wanted his Dreamscape to be capable of. Almost like an advanced AI that was capable of learning through trial and error, he wanted his Dreamscape to consume all the knowledge in the world until he could deduce anything from even the smallest hints.\nThis was only the beginning. If he added the enemies he battled into his Dreamscape, it might even become possible one day to predict the next move an opponent would take even before the battle began!\nLeonel wasn't certain if he could create a Dream Sculpt of a person's combat tendencies just yet, but now that the idea had popped up into his mind, he refused to let it die down.. If Simeon could evolve his ability, he could do so as well. Not only would he do it, but he would do it to an even greater extent!",

      "content": "Originally, everyone always sent glances toward Leonel due to the gold embroidery on his robes making it obvious that he was a Holy Son. But now, everyone looked at him as though he was some kind of freak.\nNo matter where he went in the library, the surrounding tens of meters would be completely cleared of people. It was simply impossible for them to comfortably study and read beneath his oppressive aura.\nIt was one thing if that was all, but he was reading an obscene amount of books. He would always go to a new table empty handed, but in the next moment, one after another, he would pull massive texts from thin air and stack them several meters into the sky. Then, after he returned them all, he would move to a new section of the library and repeat the process again.\nThough all of this was weird, it was still manageable. But, what was truly ridiculous was his reading speed. Leonel seemed to flip through the pages of the books he chose as though he was using them as a fan rather than for reading material.\nMany thought that Leonel was only putting up a show of strength after this continued for a while, causing their initial impressions of the new Holy Son to take a dip. After all, even a Magus couldn't read books so quickly, let alone an Apprentice Mage who wasn't even familiar with the material to begin with.\nOne had to remember that this was a Zone. It wasn't a land where abilities had awakened. Aside from Leonel and the 11 others that entered with him, there shouldn't be any others who had 'evolved'. So, it was impossible for them to make this connection.\nHowever, as time passed, those watching came to realize that if this was all a show… Leonel was a bit too committed. There were even instances of many who tried to strike up a conversation with him, including gorgeous female mages, yet he didn't spare any of them the time of day. He continued reading as though he hadn't noticed their presence.\nIf this was something he was doing for attention… shouldn't he accept the attention he earned?\nCould it be that he was really reading that fast…?\nThe truth was that these people were right. Leonel really wasn't reading. But, that wasn't because he was putting up an act, but rather because he didn't have to.\nWhen one looks at the world through one's eyes, it was possible to take in everything in one glance. However, if one wanted to remember in detail what was seen, it would then be necessary to consciously analyze everything.\nThis was how reading worked too. Technically, as long as it was within one's line of vision, it was possible to see the whole page at once, but it was obviously only possible to read one word at a time.\nHowever, if Leonel used Dream Sculpt, he could 'save' this page into his memories in the blink of an eye. Like this, it would be just like he read the page, but much quicker.\nIn addition, since there was nothing complicated about a page of words, Leonel didn't have to spend hours or days like he had to in the past. Almost like he was taking a picture with his mind, everything would be saved in an instant.\nQuickly, the database of knowledge in Leonel's mind grew at explosive rates. In just half a month, he had read through every single book at and below the Level Four.\nLeonel closed the last book and looked up with red eyes. His gaze was filled with a mixture of fatigue and a hidden piercing light.\nHe finally understood what the difference between him and Three Star Magi and Three Star Grand Knights was. It all came back to the same thing time and time again: Crystallization.\nIn the magic system Leonel was currently using, one he gained from [Dimensional Cleanse], there was no need for Crystallization. There was a very simple reason for this. Once one wanted to break free from the Third Dimension and reach the Fourth Dimension, one would begin sensing a higher level Force.\nThere was a qualitative change between with each dividing Dimensional line. It was impossible for someone within the Third Dimension to defeat someone within the Fourth, and impossible for someone within the Fourth to defeat someone in the Fifth.\nThough it was possible for someone to jump power levels within a shared Dimension, doing so across Dimensions was impossible. This was a qualitative difference in strength.\nThink about it… Did you need to struggle to crumple a piece of paper?\nHowever, Camelot took a different approach, and this was Crystallization! One might not struggle to rip a single piece of paper, but what about two? Three? A hundred? A thousand?\nInstead of leaping to a qualitative change in strength, they consolidated the strength they did have and evolved it with a quantitative change instead.\nThis also explained why his supposedly Fifth Dimensional spirit was still so weak. How could it be considered true Fifth Dimensional Soul Force when it was formed with Third Dimensional Force?\nIt was no wonder Elys and even Aliard had mistaken his spirit for being at the level of a Three Star Magus. In substance, his spirit was lacking in comparison to theirs. But, in potential, his far surpassed theirs. The average of the two opposing ideas landed him right in the middle…\nIt was only now Leonel realized how truly flawed his stat system was…\n'It's a shame. Though they take this approach, it has no use at the next level. All this hard work of theirs would have to be dispelled the moment they want to truly enter the Fourth Dimension…'\nLeonel realized that this was only a case of short term benefits. Since Third Dimensional Force had to be dispelled in favor of Fourth Dimensional Force, any Crystallization one's Third Dimensional Force underwent would be useless in the future.\nAfter a moment, an arc of electricity suddenly bolted through Leonel's Dream World. Leonel knew what this was immediately. It was a phenomenon that occurred when his Dreamscape made a connection.\nWith Leonel's every passing thought, these arcs of lightning would connect the various Dream Sculpts within his Dreamscape, almost like the real synapses of a brain. However, they were usually ignored by him unless… an arc of lightning had a particularly wide set of branches.\nThe more branches an arc of lightning formed, the more ideas it was connecting, and thus the more complex the thought it was forming was.\nLeonel's eyes shone. Just what idea had his Dreamscape stumbled onto?\nLeonel began to meditate on the connected Dream Sculpts. After a few seconds, his eyes snapped open once more, burning with a fierce light.\nHis previous thinking was too naive. Force had other uses aside from the power it output. For example, hadn't Leonel's physical stats improved with each Node he formed?\nThere was a limit to this once he reached the Ninth Node. However, what if he Crystallized his Force? Wouldn't the benefits to his body be much greater?\nLeonel looked at the central Dream Sculpt that hung between all the arcs of lightning. It was book by the title of 'Knights and Mages: The War of Ideologies'.\nLeonel suddenly saw a bright light at the end of a dark tunnel. All this time, he had been worried. After so long, all of his calculations concluded that his Tenth Node formation would end in failure.. However this… changed everything.",

      "content": "\"I would like to enter.\"\nAt that moment, Leonel stood outside another library of sorts within the Mage Academy. But, this library was much different as it was the place that housed the Magic Arts of Camelot.\nOf course, by now, it was obvious to Leonel that the 'Magic Arts' of Camelot were the very same Force Arts he was used to. The only difference lied in the fact that the Force Art language of Camelot allowed them to directly draw their Magic Arts in the air.\nThe downside of this system was that their Magic Arts — or rather, Force Arts — were weaker than the ones Leonel was used to. This only made sense. After all, a Force Art written on a proper medium like a precious ore, for example, could draw on much more power and produce much more strength.\nHowever, when drawn directly into the air, the Magic Arts were fleeting and thus weaker. In addition, they had to be completed within a certain period of time or else they would begin to dispel before the Art was even completed.\nOf course, while there were downsides, there were upsides as well. For one, they were much more convenient to use.\nWithin the Joan of Arc Zone, Leonel had to carry around planks of wood just for a simple fire Force Art that was only useful against normal humans. Also, due to the common nature of the medium he used, the power of the Force Art was obviously also limited as a result.\nSo, while this Magic Art system had its downsides, it also had its positives as well.\nThe guards of the Magic Art Tower were known as Deacons. They were students who had already graduated and thus took up positions within the Academy to continue reaping benefits.\nThe tower was located within the Academy, making it look quite odd. After all, it was building built within a building. However, its majesty was no less grand.\nIt was within a greenhouse of the Academy grounds. Up above, there was a large dome of glass and all around one could find lush grass and well-tended gardens.\nThe tower itself was quite tall. From the outside, one could see that it had ten floors and stood at about 50 meters in height. It had a very simple stone design to it that radiated an ancient air.\nThe two Deacons stood on opposite sides of the door. Both were women and each wore an odd armor crossed with robes. It was quite a unique style of dress that was reserved for those with Deacon titles.\nSince this place was so important, it wasn't a surprise that the Deacons tasked with guarding it were quite powerful and as such, equally as haughty.\nHowever, their arrogant expressions faltered when they seemingly noticed Leonel's robes. Originally, they hadn't even looked Leonel in the eye but now they found it difficult to even speak.\n\"… Can I?\"\nLeonel thought that he had maybe done something wrong. He had only learned that this tower existed after overhearing a conversation. Elys had yet to introduce it to him, so he really wasn't sure if he was allowed to be here. He only felt that it was more weird that the area around the tower was so vacant.\nThough there were many students around this greenhouse, many of them were several tens of meters away from the tower and seemed content with socializing within its vicinity.\nFor a place that Leonel thought should be popular, this was indeed weird behavior.\nThe two Deacons snapped awake and were about to usher Leonel in, a bit embarrassed by their previous actions, when their expressions suddenly changed once again.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow and turned back to follow their line of sight. When he saw what it was that had caught their attention, he nodded his head in understanding.\nComing toward him, there was a small group of three people — two men and a woman.\nIn the middle of them, there was a man. The man and woman to either side both wore the deep blue robes of Three Star Official Mages while the man in the middle wore the pale violet robes of a One Star Magus.\nWhat was curious was that the two Three Star Official Mages didn't have any embroidery on their robes, making it impossible to tell what branch of magic they followed. Now that Leonel thought about it, he hadn't seen any embroidery on Elys' or Aliard's robes either. He wasn't sure whether this was a stylistic choice or if there was a deeper reason.\nHowever, at the moment, none of this mattered. The reason Leonel was so understanding of the reaction of the Deacons was because the man in the middle of the two of them did have embroidery. And… That embroidery was identical to his own.\nThere was only one young man in Camelot that was simultaneously so young and could wear golden embroidery like Leonel… Lionus Pendragon!\nLionus was a tall man, just as tall as Leonel. He had flowing blond hair and piercing sky blue eyes that made women swoon. His shoulders were broad and he had a kingly disposition between his brows. Even with the amiable smile that hung on his lips, he had a dignified air to him that made him well suited to be on a throne.\nLionus met Leonel's eyes and a pleasantly surprised look flashed within his gaze when he noticed the familiar embroidery. What surprised him even more, though, was that Leonel's disposition, although somewhat more reserved than his own, didn't seem to lose out to him in momentum at all.\nHe could tell that Leonel was a leader of men, but he could also tell that Leonel maintained a humble facade on the surface that limited his overall leadership ability. It was simple for him to tell that this was a flaw of Leonel's.\nIt could only be said that Lionus was truly the Crown Prince of a Kingdom, to be able to see through Leonel with just a glance like this made his abilities clear.\nLionus smiled and closed the distance between himself and Leonel.\nThe two Deacons were startled awake and kneeled down to one knee in salute.\n\"Prince Lionus!\"\n\"Ah, there's no need for this. Please rise!\"\nLeonel smiled lightly, crossed a hand over his chest and bowed slightly.\n\"Greetings, Prince.\"\nLeonel hadn't been born in a culture where there was a heavy stigma against bowing or kneeling. So, he didn't really have an opinion about doing it one way or another. He wouldn't have minded kneeling at all, the only reason he hadn't and only slightly lowered his head was because he heard Lionus say that there was no need to.\nMaybe had he been born elsewhere, or maybe in a different era, Leonel would rather die than kneel. But, this wasn't the life he was born into. That said, whether this would continue to be true in the future was a matter yet to be determined.\nLionus smiled brightly. \"I've heard a lot about you. Leonel is your name, correct? It's great that our Camelot can have another Holy Son. I've wanted to meet you for a long time, but I heard that you were injured.\"\nSeeing Lionus' genial approach, even Leonel couldn't help but feel a bit warm. It seemed this Crown Prince's charisma wasn't small.\n\"It's good that you're here, actually.\" Lionus continued. \"This way, we can enter the tower together. Ah, forgive me for my lack of manners.\n\"This here is Official Mage Theybul, son of Sir Gawain of the Round Table. This is Official Mage Mary, daughter of Three Star Magus Tilda. They are very close to their Magus Ascension, so they've come to visit the tower one more time.\"\nThe two politely greeted Leonel with nods and smiles.\nLeonel's brows raised in surprise.. It seemed that none of these three had lackluster identities.",

      "content": "Leonel smiled and scratched his head awkwardly.\n\"Now that you mention it, I'm not really sure what the purpose of this tower is. Could you explain it to me?\"\nLeonel and Lionus walked into the first floor of the tower. In truth, Leonel wanted to preface his question with a bit more, but he was a bit stunned by what he saw.\nThe room follow the same rounded shape as the tower outside. It was quite spacious and quiet. Despite the large size, there were only a handful of people here, but they were all crowded around the same thing.\nIn the center of the first floor, there was a large, floating crystal. It was easily three meters in diameter and seemed to slowly spin without any support. It hung perfectly in the air and radiated a dull light.\n\"Ah, right, you're still unfamiliar with some things.\" Lionus didn't seem to mind.\nThough the small number of mages within the tower all looked toward the new arrivals and were stunned by their identities, seemingly used to this, Lionus continued to speak at a leisurely pace.\n\"The Mage Art Tower is a place that houses all of the Magic Arts Camelot has accumulated. As long as it was once conceived by a mage of our Kingdom, then it will be here. However, the matters here aren't so simple either.\n\"It's clear how valuable such a place is, so it's not a location that can be casually entered, nor is it possible to even if you were simply allowed to roam freely.\n\"There are only three ways to be allowed to enter this tower. The first way is the typical single entry once a year. For each year you graduate or enter in the Academy, you're allowed one entry.\"\nLeonel nodded. He realized now why the surrounding space was so empty. This wasn't normal enrollment times, so those who should have entered their first years along with him had already long since come.\n\"The second way is by gaining Military Achievements and the last way is by becoming a Childe of the Elements. Should you accomplish the last one, you would be allowed unlimited entries to the Mage Art Tower and can travel up as far as your Spirit Pressure allows.\"\n\"Childe of the Elements?\" Leonel asked in confusion.\n\"Yes.\" Lionus nodded with a smile. \"A Childe of the Elements has the same privileges as a Holy Son. In fact, you could say that a Childe is a Holy Son, just not of the Light Element.\n\"You see that crystal ball up there? It's able to test for Crystallization Affinity. When someone's affinity touches upon a certain standard, they will be designated a Childe. In fact, it could be said that the only advantage a Holy Son has over a Childe is that our affinities do not need to be checked.\n\"Because the Light Element is so powerful, even a Holy Son with a low affinity will be more powerful than the usual high affinity mage.\"\n\"Ah, so it's like this…\"\nLeonel suddenly understood many things now. In addition, he was quite curious. If the Light Element was so powerful with low affinity, what was it like with high affinity? And, what was his own affinity?\nHe assumed that compared to those of Camelot, his affinity was exceptionally high. After all, this was a Third Dimensional world while the Snowy Star Owl was an Elite Sixth Dimensional beast after maturing.\n\"Then what is so beneficial about the tower that Official Mage Theybul and Mary would come before their Magus Ascension?\"\nLeonel directed a curious question toward the two mages.\n\"His Highness touched on it a bit.\" Mary responded. \"How high one can climb the Mage Art Tower depends on what one's Spirit Pressure can take. Each successive floor comes with a stronger pressure. This pressure is good for weeding out impurities that might linger in our Spirit Pressure and gives us a good push toward the next boundary.\"\n\"I see, thank you.\" Leonel thanked them sincerely.\nLionus smiled. \"It's been a while since I've seen someone take the Crystallization Affinity trial, why don't you try it out, Leonel?\"\n\"Sure!\"\nLeonel had been eager to do so since the beginning, so he had no reason to refuse.\nLionus and Leonel walked toward the floating crystal. At that moment, there was another youth testing his affinity.\nAffinity wasn't set in stone according to Camelot's magic system. It was possible to increase affinity through meditation and comprehension. In addition, after having breakthroughs in Spirit Pressure, affinity naturally increases as well. However, the higher one's starting base affinity, the more potential for growth they had in the future.\nThis was all to say that it wasn't a surprise to find a person testing themselves once again. This affinity test was actually also a good gauge of how far one could climb the tower. Though resisting the Spirit Pressure required one's own Spirit Pressure, it was also possible to get by with weaker Spirit Pressure if one's affinity was high enough.\nSo, youths would sometimes test their affinities before they climbed the tower so that they didn't push themselves too hard and cause irreparable injury to their spirit.\nThe young man who was about to place his hand on the crystal suddenly swayed nervously. When he had come here today, the last thing he had expected was to be observed by a Holy Son and the Crown Prince… Not to mention two other Childes in Mary and Theybul!\nHowever, he could only press down his nervousness. Wouldn't he look too pathetic now if he backed away?\nAfter taking a deep breath, he pressed his hand to the crystal.\nWENG!\nThe crystal began to emit a lustrous glow.\n\"The affinity scale of the crystal is dependent on the radiance of the light. It the light projects a foot out from the surface of the crystal, it meets the minimum requirement to enter the Mage Academy — this would be the One Star Affinity ranking. With it, one might be able to become an Official Mage with hard work.\"\nLionus patiently explained things to Leonel.\n\"The color is related to the element. This young mage's glow is a light green, so he's a wind affinity mage.\n\"The light needs to radiate out one meter to become a Two Star Affinity. Such a person can likely make a name for themselves within the world of Official Mages. At five meters, it reaches Three Star Affinity. Such a person has a sliver of a chance to become a Magus.\n\"At nine meters, this entered the Four Star Affinity realm. Such a person has a good chance of becoming a Magus and a slim chance of becoming a Two Star Magus.\n\"Finally, at ten meters, the crystal will form a halo like the rings of a planet. This halo represents the realm of a Childe.\n\"Of course, it's possible to increase one's affinity through hard work and persistence. In addition, a higher tier Element like our Light Element makes it easier to breakthrough realms, so regardless of your results, hold your head high.\"\nLeonel smiled lightly in response. In regards to his affinity, he wasn't too worried. Even if it really did turn out to be low, he would still find a way to use this magic system to form his Tenth Node.\nThe young mage finally stepped down from the platform with a flushed face. He was a bit excited. He had actually managed to touch the barrier of the Fourth Star. His hard work had definitely paid off. After all, since he could be here, it meant he had rendered great service to Camelot's armies.\nSeeing that he was finished, Leonel took a step forward, seemingly not realizing the number of gazes that followed his back.\nHe climbed the steps and stood on the platform, his expression calm as he stretched his hand forward.\nWENG! WENG! WENG!\nA blinding light suddenly swept out in all directions.\nLionus raised his eyebrows up in shock. If it was just that Leonel had a high affinity, it would be easy to accept. But this.... what was this?",

      "content": "CRACK!\nLeonel hurriedly retracted his hand, but it was already too late.\nA massive fissure snaked across the crystal, expelling with it a hardly noticeable fog.\nThe moment Leonel retracted his hand, the blinding lights lingered for a moment before quickly receding. Soon, his figure was clearly seen once more, allowing several pairs of eyes to fall on his body.\nLionus, especially, was speechless. Everything happened too fast for the others to get a clear understanding of what had happened, but he had been able to catch a faint inkling.\nThe reality was that having just a single affinity was impossible. Most people had many different affinities. The only difference was in how those affinities compared. In fact, the truth of the matter was that much of the reason affinities were so low among the majority of the population was because these differing affinities would clash with one another, making it more difficult to excel in one.\nWhat set Childes apart was their ability to filter out the noise. Ironically, their affinities for secondary or tertiary elements was much lower than their counterparts, but in return, they gained great affinity in just one aspect.\nHowever, Lionus was certain that what he had seen was correct. In that brief moment, Leonel formed a blinding dark gold halo.\nThis should have all been fine. After all, the formation of a halo was the marker of a Childe. To be both a Holy Son and a Childe… Leonel would be the only one in their entire Kingdom! Even Lionus' own father wasn't considered a Childe of the Light Element when he first started. It was only after years of meditation and practice that he reached this standard.\nBut… The issue was that dark gold wasn't the symbollic marker for the Light Element… It was the marker for the Earth Element!\nLionus' brows involuntarily trembled.\nLeonel's affinity for the Earth Element was actually obscene to the point of directly suppressing his Light Element. Not only that, but its affinity was so far beyond the standard of? a Childe that it would have shattered the crystal had Leonel not reacted so quickly.\n'The color for the Earth Element should have been a dirty yellowish brown color. But that was most definitely a bright bronze or dark gold color… That means that Leonel's not only an Earth Elemental Childe, but also one with a variant affinity…'\nLionus exhaled a long breath.\n\"… Sorry…\"\nLeonel's voice finally broke the silence. But the word he spoke caused Lionus to be speechless. Eventually, the Crown Prince laughed bitterly and shook his head.\n\"It's nothing to worry about, this crystal is easily replaceable. We have mines filled with it and even have higher grade ones used exclusively by Magi.\"\nHearing this, Leonel sighed a breath of relief.\nHowever, after a moment, he sunk into his own thoughts. He too had senses sharp enough to notice that his halo was actually dark gold and not gold. From what Lionus explained to him, it seemed his affinity for the Earth Element was even higher than his affinity for the Light Element.\nAt the same time, he could tell that his Light Element wasn't any weaker than that of a Childe either. The issue was that this crystal was only able to show a single affinity at a time and tended toward the more powerful one.\n'I see…'\nLeonel had come here expecting to just pour his heart and soul into studying Light Elemental Magic Arts. But, if things were like this, he couldn't neglect his Earth Element either.\n**\nWhile Leonel was taking every advantage he could from the Mage Academy, it couldn't be forgotten that there was 11 others who had entered this Zone with him. And, in a lot of ways, their methods were far better than his own. Maybe this wasn't the case in the ultimate result, but it was most definitely the case in baseline success.\nRather than coming with their own identity, the others took advantage of the fact this was a land without technology to take on the identities of those who already called Camelot home. As a result, unlike the unlucky Leonel, they didn't have to worry about being called traitors.\nOf course, it wasn't that Leonel hadn't thought of this… It was just that he was unwilling to commit the cruel acts necessary to take such an identity for himself.\nThat said… This wasn't the only method either.\nAt that moment, Supreme Monet sat in silent meditation on a large bed. She wore a silk lace gown, defining her curves. Despite the faint wrinkles on her face, she still had a stifling, captivating beauty that could cause the hearts of men to boil.\nThe deep ravine of her chest revealed the not so subtle mounds of soft flesh and the mesh of lace that covered them showed just a hint of her rounded pink nipples.\nIt could only be said that the sight was simply too enticing. If not for the fact she was sitting down in meditation, her lower half might just very well be another sight to behold.\nAt that moment, the doors to her room opened. But, the one who entered wasn't what one would expect at all.\nA familiar woman wearing a deep black dress sauntered into the room. Her countenance was exceptionally pale, yet somehow had a healthy glow to it. It felt as though she had been carved of ice and had not a drop of blood within her body.\nThe woman walked to Monet who slowly opened her eyes. Monet could only lift her chin as the black dressed woman pulled it up with a slender finger that soon traced her jaw.\nSeeing the enticing view of Monet's body, the woman breath hitched ever so slightly, her face finally gaining just the slightest red hue.\n\"I usually like younger women.\" The black dressed woman said softly, her voice as smooth as silk. \"But it seems that I've missed out on the allure of maturity. You are to my liking, you'll serve me tonight.\"\nThe black dress that followed the woman's curves slowly fell, revealing a perfectly sculpted body. In fact, her figure held a hidden power within it, carrying the faint carved muscles of a man while maintaining the soft curves of a woman.\nHer breasts stood erect and proud as she lifted a long slender leg, placing it on the bed Monet sat upon. A fragrant bush graced her most sacred region, just barely revealing two pink lips hidden beneath.\nThe woman stood like this for a moment, one leg planted on the soft carpets of the room and the other lifted up to the silk sheets of the bed. She allowed Monet who sat before her to take in her alluring body without the slightest hint of shame or bashfulness as she continued to stroke the latter's jawline.\nMonet's expression was calm as she met the woman's gaze, carrying a hint of the lofty air the latter carried. But, this only seemed to make the woman want her more.\nThen, as though she couldn't wait any longer, her slender fingers stopped tracing Monet's chin and grasped it gently. A soft moan escaped the woman's cherry lips as she pulled? Monet's head between her legs.\nThe woman placed a hand on the back of Monet's head, sinking into pleasure. Her eyes closed and her head angled upward, soft rhythmic breaths heaving her chest up and down.\nOne could have never expected that the woman Monet was currently servicing with her tongue was the lofty Demon Lord, Modred.",

      "content": "[Schedule will be changing. Updates will be at 10pm EST from now on.]\nLeonel, of course, had no idea what was happening across this mythological land. If he did, he might have had many questions to ask. But, at this point, all he cared about were the Magic Arts before him.\nLionus, Theybul and Mary had long since climbed the tower. But, since he was still a One Star Apprentice mage, he would obviously stay on the first floor.\nThis was not as bad as it sounded, either. Since the only ones who could enter the Mage Art Tower at this time of year were Childes or youths with military exploits, there were very few in the tower to begin with. And, of those that could enter, just how many of them would still need Arts from the first floor?\nBecause of this, Leonel was completely alone. In fact, he would probably be completely alone even if he climbed to the fifth floor.\nThe floor itself was split into nine regions. A region for Wind, Water, Fire, Earth, Lightning, Wood, Light, Auxiliary and Mental Magic Arts.\nAside from the four main elements, lightning and wood were unique variations that had appeared in Camelot's long history. They were quite rare, even compared to others. Only the Light Element was rarer.\nAs for the Mental Magic Arts, they could be used by anyone. There were also some mages who had exceptionally high Spirit Pressure talent, but had no strong affinities. These mages were excellent at these sort of Mental Magics.\nIn fact, Leonel had thought that Theybul and Mary were Mental Magic Mages. That would explain why their robes didn't have any embroidery on them.\nThe auxiliary section could be learned by anyone. They were the fundamental magic all mages should have under their belts.\nFor example, both Elys and Aliard had been able to meet the swords of knights with their wands alone. This wasn't because their wands — or what the people of Camelot called Spiritual Wood — were so sturdy or because their strengths were so great, it was because of auxiliary magic like [Repel] or [Strengthen] or [Harden].\nOf course, the auxiliary magic on the first floor was so weak that they couldn't possibly help the current Leonel. But, that didn't mean this would always be true.\nWithin the nine regions, there were various podiums. Each podium held a crystal ball. These crystal balls were the mediums that held the Magic Arts. However, reaching them wasn't so simple.\nJust in order to enter a region, one needed a certain level of affinity or else one would only find a barrier that was impossible to cross.\nOf course… Leonel had nothing to worry about on the first floor.\nHe directly walked into the Light Region, feeling very curious. Even though the first floor should have the most Arts of any floor due to their low difficulty, the Light Region still had the smallest number of podiums at around 40 or so.\nLeonel picked up the closest one. There was no pressure on him at all, so he felt he could take his time.\nHis Spirit Pressure easily shattered the barrier around the podium. Soon, his Internal Sight had entered the world of the crystal and a Magic Art was reflected in his mind.\n'[Shine]…'\nLeonel almost couldn't help but chuckle. This Magic Art was exactly what it sounded like. It was used for nothing else than lighting a path. Who would have thought that the mighty Light Element would have such a day too.\n'Dream Sculpt…'\nLeonel's aura surged, his spirit draining as he etched the Magic Art into his mind.\n'47 seconds…'\nLeonel nodded. It took him less than a minute to perfectly etch a Magic Art into his Dreamscape.\nHis mind left the crystal ball. With a thought, his Spirit Pressure surged once more, congealing onto the palm of his hand.\nIn the blink of an eye, a surge of wind swirled. After it settled down, a radiant halo formed on Leonel's palm, causing him to smile.\nIf another person had been here, they would have been shocked to the point of fitting a baseball into their mouths. In total, it took Leonel not much longer than a minute to learn and conjure his first Magic Art. Such speed was obscene to the point of being beyond monstrous.\nOne had to know that a mage would usually meditate on a single Magic Art for days before attempting to conjure it. And, even then, they would need Spiritual Wood to concentrate their Spirit Pressure. As if all of this wasn't bad enough, it would take several seconds to complete on the first try. Only after continuous practice would it slowly take less and less time, but even then, it most definitely shouldn't have been as fast as Leonel.\nHowever… Leonel's ability was just too perfect for the world of mages.\nWith his Dream Sculpt ability, he could memorize a Magic Art in minutes. And, since it was a perfect, immutable memory in his mind, he would never make a mistake in conjuring it. As a result, he didn't need Spiritual Wood to keep his Spirit Pressure focused. If he had a wand of his own, it would be like adding wings to a tiger.\nBut, Leonel had no intention of wielding a wand. He wanted the ability to cast while he used his spear, he didn't have hands to spare for a wand.\nThis advantage of Leonel's would only grow. For higher grade Magic Arts, it would sometimes take mages years, even decades of meditation to perfectly master them. For Leonel… It just might be a matter of a few days.\n'These One Star Apprentice Arts won't be very useful to me. They're too weak. Maybe only high level Official Arts can start boosting my combat prowess. But, it's best I Dream Sculpt all of these into my Dreamscape, maybe I'll be able to draw some useful conclusions if I do…'\nLeonel picked up another crystal ball and bitterly smiled.\n'[Multi-Shine]…'\nLeonel was speechless. It can't be that all these Magic Arts wanted to turn him into a glorified light bulb, right?",

      "content": "[Schedule will be changing. Updates will be at 10pm EST from now on.]\nA swirl of wind surged toward Leonel once again. This time, his body was surrounded by several halos of light. Instead of appearing in a concentrated form, they flew around his body like fireflies.\nLeonel shook his head. He chose to reserve his judgment for now. After all, he didn't have an accurate gauge of what One Star Apprentice Arts were meant to be capable of. Assuming the worst of the Light Element just for two spells was a bit silly.\nPlus, these Arts weren't exactly useless. Had he had them in the Mayan Tomb, some things might have been easier. Since he had already learned that his Internal Sight wasn't perfect, he knew that there would always be some things he could only rely on his eyes for..\nAfter Leonel was finished, he moved toward the third crystal ball, shattering its protective barrier with just as much ease.\n\"…\"\nLeonel looked at the Magic Art in his hand for a good long while before sighing once again.\n[Shining Eyes] … It was a Magic Art capable of attracting the Light Element to one's eyes, thus granting them night vision.\nAt this point, Leonel really didn't know what to say. It couldn't be that all the Light Element Magic Arts were related to seeing through darkness… right?\nLeonel Dream Sculpted the Dream Art and moved on to a fourth, and fifth and sixth… Eventually, he had gone through over 30.\nAt this point, he felt the situation was too ridiculous. If he saw one more Magic Art with 'Shine' in its title, he just might go insane.\nNo matter what Light Magic Art he looked at, they were all related to shining. Creating halos of light, giving himself night vision, adding luminescence to objects for extended periods of time, there was even a spell for attaching two objects with 'shine'. When these two objects were close, they wouldn't shine, but, if they grew too far apart, they would begin to glow, allowing you to find the other.\nLeonel put the crystal ball down, a helpless expression on his face.\n'This is basically a spell to find lost keys… unbelievable…'\nLeonel walked toward the last four Magic Arts while he readjusted his mind state. This was just the first level. He didn't believe that the Light Element would be so worshipped in Camelot if this was all there was to it.\nPlus, there was something curious about these Magic Arts. Though they all had similar functions, they all accomplished it in novel ways. There was definitely a lesson to be learned here, it made Leonel more eager to see what the others had to offer.\n'Oh?'\nLeonel's brows arched in pleasant surprise.\nNow that he thought about it, the pressure on his Spirit increased the further he walked into this region. And, though the change was small, the protective coverings were also growing in strength.\nLogically, that meant that what remained of this region were the most powerful Light Magic Arts of this first floor. And, they didn't disappoint.\n'[Flash]…'\nOnce again, this was a shine type Light Magic Art, however, it was different in comparison to the others. If it was applied in battle, it could actually work.\n'So that's how it is… If an Apprentice works and eventually makes their way here after going through all the others, it lays a perfect foundation for this…'\n[Flash] concentrated the Light Element into a small flash, temporarily blinding an opponent. Even at his current strength, Leonel wouldn't mind using this in battle.\nLeonel moved to the next.\n'[Light Screen]…'\nLeonel smiled. Now he felt a bit bad thinking that all of these Arts would be useless. In order to get into this Zone, he had to fight his way through that little girl's ability. But, back then, he wasted a lot of Force just emitting as much Light Elemental Force as he could.\nHowever, if he had had [Light Screen] back then, the consumption on his Force would have been near negligible.\nThe last two Magic Arts were [Flash Bang] and [Flash Arrow]. The former could concentrate light and explode it on a timer. It used concepts from the lost key detector Art Leonel was just making fun of. As for the latter, [Flash Arrow], it was the first real offensive Art Leonel had found.\n[Flash Arrow]'s offensive output was near negligible. It quite literally had the strength of a mosquito bite. But, according to the description, if aimed into an enemy's eyes, the blinding effect could last for several minutes depending on the situation.\nUnsurprisingly, its effects pulled on concepts from [Shining Eyes].\nLeonel stood for a long time within the Light Region, his state of mind going into a sort of enlightenment.\nArcs of lightning surged across his Dreamscape as a light smile crossed his face.\n'Even if this magic system is only useful to me within the Third Dimension, it's really taught me something valuable…'\nLeonel took a deep breath and calmed his beating heart.\nEverything complex was built upon the simple. Even the most intricate of Magic Arts would pull on concepts from these seemingly pitiful One Star Apprentice Arts. This was a concept that stretched past just Magic Arts, couldn't anything be described in this way?\nLeonel's current Earth could be considered to have reached the pinnacle technology the Third Dimension could, but it was all built on the back of heroes of the past. Some of the things he was learning as a high school student were concepts some of the most intelligent men and women of the past spent their lives to grasp.\nTo him, those concepts seemed pitifully weak and simple, just like these 'shine' Magic Arts. However, to them, it represented a life of trials and tribulations, just to make it easier for kids like him to take for granted.\nLeonel opened his eyes once again, a hint of understanding and wisdom lighting them.\n'I hear you loud and clear.'\nLeonel began to rearrange his Dreamscape. Like a pyramid, he arranged things of least complexity at the bottom, building a solid foundation. Then, he placed things with increasing complexity on top.\nAfter his was finished, he felt that his Dreamscape flowed more smoothly, even the random synapses occured more frequently and even the average number of branches formed increased along with it.\nLeonel's eyes shone with anticipation. There was no limit to the floors he could climb in this tower like there was for knowledge in the libraries. This was likely because of the Spirit Pressure he needed to resist. But, how could this pressure stop Leonel?\nHe would climb to the top of this tower. And, even if it took several weeks, he would save all the Magic Arts it had into his Dreamscape.",

      "content": "BANG! BANG! BANG!\nLeonel's enigmatic steps sent him fluttering across the training room. Three puppets wearing wooden armor pressed him from all sides, conjuring spells of all kinds to bombard him.\nLeonel's eyes remained closed, his Internal Sight remaining concentrated on this small region.\nThoughts of how Lamorak had toyed with him played in his head again and again. The memories were so vivid that he could almost feel the same pain coursing through his body once more.\nLeonel was suddenly cornered by all three puppets. It seemed for a moment that he would be pincered from all sides.\nAn arrow of earth, fire and water assaulted him from different directions, aiming to take his life.\nThe puppets of this room were all entirely made of Spiritual Wood. As a result, their ability to cast spells was even beyond that of their human counterparts. This made up for their stiff actions with overwhelming power.\nThat said, to humans, more Spiritual Wood wasn't necessarily better. After all, if one's wand was too large, it would be like trying to use a sledgehammer to staple two sheets of paper together. And even that wasn't necessarily a good analogy considering in this case, the mages might not even have enough strength to 'lift' the sledgehammer.\nHowever, these puppets were different. Their Spiritual Pressure was provided by crystals. In that case, they were much less limited in this regard.\nJust when it seemed Leonel would be struck, he arched his head forward, narrowly dodging the arrow of earth. His hips twisted, ducking past the arrow of fire.\nThe two arrows swept by his body, crashing into the opposing puppets and sending them flying.\nThe final arrow of water took advantage of the situation, zipping through the air and appearing between Leonel's brows in a flash.\nLeonel's eyes suddenly snapped open, an overwhelming Spirit Pressure sweeping forth that seemed to freeze the arrow in air for a split moment.\n'[Deconstruct].'\nA sweep of wind swirled around Leonel. In that moment, a Magic Art appeared before him in the path of the arrow.\nThe water arrow regained its momentum, crashing into the Art before it without pause.\nHowever, the collision one would have expected never occurred. The water arrow seemed to pass through without issue. But it was at that moment that something astonishing happened.\nThe arrow began to lose its structure. Starting at the tip — the first point to enter Leonel's Art — it collapsed, becoming no different from normal droplets of water. In fact, Leonel felt a refreshing spray shower his face at that moment, causing him to smile.\nLeonel crossed the remaining distance between him and the water mage puppet, sending a punch out to its chest.\nPENG!\nThe form of Leonel's boxing had still been steadily increasing. All his power shot up from his pivot foot, through his hips, and into his fists, crumpling the wooden armor of the puppet.\nThe lights of the room dimmed, signaling that all the puppets had been taken down.\n'Still not enough…' Leonel muttered.\nHe had been able to force two of the puppets into a corner without lifting a finger, but still failed to do so with a third.\n'I might need to go to the Knight Academy and read the books within their library to understand what this General Star really is. Walking around blindly on my own will take too long. I have a feeling that even the primitive woman I learned this ability from only faintly touched on the topic.'\nLeonel felt that it was about time he chose a new spear. He knew he had completely mastered the technique of the primitive woman. He had just been a bit distracted by Magic Arts in recent weeks.\nFor example, [Deconstruct]. It was an auxiliary type spell of the Three Star Official Art level. But, Leonel felt that this rating was inaccurate, because it could technically work on any Magic Art.\nOf course, others knew this as well. The trouble was that this Art had many moving parts and changing forms. It was necessary to analyze the spell coming toward you and make the appropriate changes to its form. So, for most mages, it was only useful against mages of lesser skill than themselves, making it only about as good as a typical parlor trick.\n'It's too bad this arena doesn't have Magus level puppets. I wonder if [Deconstruct] would work on higher level spells…'\nAs Leonel was lost in his thoughts, he walked out from the training room, his body dripping in sweat.\n\"Leonel!\"\nLeonel looked up in surprise, pleasantly surprised to find Lionus waiting for him. He smiled in greeting.\n\"Lionus.\"\n\"I hear you already became a One Star Official Mage? Don't you think this speed is a bit too fast?\"\nLeonel laughed. In truth, he probably reached the standard of Three Star Magus already, at least in terms of the Magic Arts he knew and his ability to cast them. As for the Crystallization of his Spirit Pressure, he was lagging behind in his aspect, making his Arts less potent than they should be.\nHowever, progressing beyond the One Star Official Mage rank required more than just knowledge and ability, it was also necessary to gain certain merits. In addition, even if he could rush up to the Three Star Magus rank immediately, Leonel felt it was inappropriate to do so.\nFor one, his standing as a traitor might still be being looked into by others. Though his status as a Holy Son was enough to blind the common people and maybe some of the more religious upper echelon, there were of course those who wouldn't take this too seriously.\nOf course, Leonel still wanted to reach the Three Star Official Mage standard. This was the only way for him to finish reading all the information in the library.\nThough he found it a bit odd he could look through all their techniques, but not read all their knowledge, Leonel felt it made sense in the end. Often times, it was impossible to learn Magic Arts without the proper knowledge foundation. And, even if you had the knowledge, breaking through the barrier protecting them was another matter entirely.\nLeonel was probably the only freak in their history that could completely ignore these barriers with impunity.\nLeonel and Lionus chatted for a while about miscellaneous things before Leonel finally asked the question.\n\"Did you come here to ask something of me?\" He inquired.\n\"Ah, yes. I completely forgot. The Church has been asking about your status for a while. Before those old fogies go too crazy, it's best you go take a look. I'll take you.\"\n\"Oh?\" Leonel's brows arched up. \"Is there anything I need to do?\"\nLionus came to a realization. It was true that Leonel might not be aware of these things.\n\"The four major powers of our Kingdom center around the Royal family, the two Academies, and The Church. Holy Sons have a special status within the Church as their protectors. The Church has warriors they call Paladins, but the truth is that the only true Paladin of this Kingdom is my father.\"\nA hint of unrestrained pride glowed in Lionus' eyes. Leonel could tell that Lionus wasn't a haughty individual. The fact he had shown this kind of face just showed how much he loved and admired his dad.\nLeonel smiled lightly. His old man would probably kill to see him have such an expression, then he would laugh him to oblivion.\n'Tch, in your dreams, old man.'\nLionus shook his head, realizing that his actions had been a bit inappropriate. But, Leonel didn't seem to mind so he continued with a smile.\n\"This is good timing, honestly.\" Lionus finally said after a moment. \"You need to gain some merits whether it's for The Church or for your next Ascension and I have a mission I happen to be looking for help with. Are you interested?\"\nLeonel's eyes shone. \"Sure.\"\nWith that, Lionus led Leonel toward The Church.",

      "content": "The Church was located within the core of Camelot, some distance away from the Castle. They stood on two opposing sides of the city like two pillars holding up the world. Regardless of which it was, Leonel could feel an oppressive aura weighing down on him as though neither would be satisfied unless he bowed his head.\nIt was true that Leonel didn't grow up in a world that emphasized the importance of bowing, but what he didn't like was being forced to do anything. He subconsciously straightened his back beneath this pressure, his shoulders standing broad and wide.\nLionus blinked slightly when he saw Leonel's reactions. But, aside from a small smile, he didn't say anything else.\nDue to the oppression he felt at the gates, Leonel had subconsciously expected to walk into a warzone of sorts, but what he had never expected was that even after an hour, no one had come to receive him and Lionus.\nLeonel wasn't sure how to react to such a thing. Wasn't he a Holy Son? Wasn't he one of the only four in this Kingdom with this title? Why was it that he was suddenly being treated like this?\nLeonel sent a gaze toward Lionus who sat to his side, but the latter only had his eyes slightly closed and didn't seem to have much of a reaction.. This left Leonel stunned. He didn't feel uncomfortable about this even as the Crown Prince?\nThe waiting room the two Holy Sons sat in could hardly be called as such. The walls were decorated with polished stone in neat arrangements, the wooden furniture radiated a pleasant fragrance that carried hints of nature, and the tea placed before them — although cold by now — was quite good.\nOf course, these were just Leonel's speculations. He knew nothing about tea at all. He could probably count the number of times he had drunk tea on his two hands without much issue. He only knew that it felt quite smooth running down his throat and had a faint sweetness to it even though he hadn't used sugar.\nIn the end, since Lionus didn't say anything, Leonel didn't say anything either. But within his heart, he already felt discontent.\nFor him, it wasn't about whether he was a Holy Son or not. He just felt that this was a lack of respect.\nSince his youth, his father had ingrained those two concepts — Respect and Persistence — into his very soul. He always had a particularly bad reaction when someone was lacking in them. Though is was a bit difficult to call out someone who lacked in persistence, someone lacking in the former was too easy to identify.\nWasting a person's time was probably one of the most blatant shows of disrespect there could be. It was one thing if there were sudden matters to attend to or if their visit was sudden. However, not only had they not sent anyone to inform them of any sudden changes, but they were also the ones who had called Leonel here to visit in the first place.\nLeonel took a deep breath and sunk into his Dream World. If it wasn't for the fact Lionus was here waiting with him and that he couldn't afford to make enemies of The Church within this Zone, he would have already left after the first 20 minutes. Since there was nothing to do, he might as well continue practicing.\nThe second hour came and went. Then the third. It wasn't until a few minutes into the fourth that there was finally movement at the doors they entered to come to this waiting room.\nA knight wearing silver armor with gold engravings pushed the door open. A large shield in the shape of a triangle with curved edges was attached to his back and a proud halo hung about his forehead. He was one of the special knights The Church gave the title of paladin to.\nThe necklace-like halo that hung from the paladin's forehead reminded Leonel of the mental type treasure Aina used during their escape from the Fort. It radiated a strong Light Elemental Force that was likely the source of much of their strength.\n'Where did they get something like that…?' Leonel wondered.\nWith his improved knowledge base, Leonel understood many things now his Soul Force couldn't grasp in the past.\nFor one, he could tell that this knight had a special affinity. Or rather, lack thereof. Meaning, if he was a mage, his robes would be without embroidery.\nSecondly, it was because he was without an affinity and had decent Spirit Pressure that he could make use of that Light Elemental treasure.\nLeonel guessed that most paladins probably had no affinities so they could continue using this child of the light facade.\n\"Pope Margrave will see you now.\"\nThe haughty air of the paladin was practically palpable. Leonel kept his eyes closed for a moment as he was close to grasping something. It wasn't until a few seconds later he registered the words of the paladin and opened his eyes.\nYet, it seemed those few seconds were already enough for this paladin to be close to blowing his top.\nLeonel frowned lightly seeing the paladin's reaction. They had been forced to wait over three hours, yet a few seconds was enough to get this paladin up in arms?\nIn the end, Leonel pretended not to notice the dissatisfaction.\nLionus smiled. \"Please lead the way, Sir paladin.\"\nLionus' words seemed to ease the tension. No matter how haughty these paladins were, they did still feel a hint of something when a mighty Crown Prince was so respectful to them.\n\"Hmph.\"\nThe paladin harrumphed once and turned down the hallway, leading the two young men up a winding set of stone stairs.\nFrom beginning to end, Lionus didn't say anything to Leonel. It was as though he wanted Leonel to experience all of this on his own first. Or, maybe he was just curious about Leonel's reactions without guidance.\n'It seems it becomes more difficult for him to hide that ingrained haughtiness when he feels a lack of respect.' Lionus smiled to himself. 'It's truly odd. If he really was an orphan, he should have seen the cruelty of the world long ago. Had he, his true disposition would have shone through already.\n'But, the way he acts it's as if he's lived in a cocoon his whole life, like he's never had to fight for anything… Such a disposition makes it much more likely that his identity isn't what he says it is, but it's equally unlikely that he was sent by Modred. There's no way he would be so sheltered in a place like the Demon Army…\n'Just who is this Leonel really…?'",

      "content": "The paladin took a final step forward, pressing his hands against two large wooden doors and pushing.\nA flood of light assaulted Leonel's vision, forcing him to squint. By the time his vision cleared, he could only shake his head.\nThe room was far too bright. Unlike the room he had woken up in after his battle with Lamorak, he found it difficult even open his eyes without a stinging pain assaulting them.\nEmbroidery of gold and silver raced across the room, forming up into a wide set of stairs that ended in a tall throne with a backrest that reached up to the ceiling.\nOn the throne, there sat a handsome middle aged man. In fact, Leonel found that just handsome didn't do him much justice. Even the movie stars of Earth women swooned over would look like piles of cowdung before this man. If Leonel placed great emphasis on his own looks, it was likely that even he would start to feel a bit inferior.\n.\nThe man had a head of bright white hair. And, though his eyes were partially closed, Leonel could see that his irises held a deep silver color to them. The only thing that impeded his handsome disposition somewhat was the large headdress on his head.\nSeeing this man, Leonel understood a bit of why The Church didn't take him as a Holy Son very seriously. The Spirit Pressure coming from this man was at the standard of a Three Star Magus.\nEverything made sense now. This man was the fourth Holy Son of Camelot, a Three Star Magus of the Light Element, Pope Margrave.\nHowever, what happened next truly left Leonel speechless.\nThe paladin respectfully crossed the bright room, climbed the first few steps leading to the Pope's throne, then respectfully knelt and kissed his feet. It was only then Leonel realized that the Pope wasn't wearing any footwear to speak of, his feet shone like gems at the base of his throne as though expecting to be worshipped.\n\"…?\"\nNo matter what era Leonel was born in, something like kissing another's feet crossed his own bottomline.\nThe paladin retreated to the side, taking up his post among the guards that lined the walls of the room. He stood at attention and became like a statue in the blink of an eye. It was as though what had just happened had nothing to do with him.\n\"Greet His Holiness!\"\nThe sudden roar shook Leonel out of his shock.\nThe paladins that lined the walls spoke as one, their voices rolling like rumbling thunder.\nBy now, Leonel had recollected his thoughts. He realized that kissing a pope's feet was actually quite historically accurate. It seemed that even though this was a Mythological Zone, it still touched on things that were rooted in real life.\nHowever, at the end of the day, Leonel was still a teenage boy. He had already buried his discontent for so long. If he also had to kiss this man's feet, he just might lose his cool entirely.\nLeonel was a person who didn't get angry very easily. Even now, he wasn't necessarily enraged. But, he wasn't a pushover either.\nLionus curiously observed Leonel for a while, seemingly curious. Seeing the latter step forward, he smiled and followed suit.\n\"Greetings.\"\nLeonel gave the most medieval salute he could think of, greeting the Pope. But, he didn't climb the stairs, nor did he kneel. In his mind, setting down his pride to greet this Pope first was already asking enough of him.\n\"This Prince greets His Holiness.\" Lionus' smile widened, his actions mirroring Leonel's.\nAs the Crown Prince, he of course had no need to kneel or kiss feet. However, he still had to show this Pope due respect, whether it be as a magus or the leader of The Church.\nAt that moment, a surge of killing intent swirled around the room. It seemed to want to completely crush Leonel where he stood.\nLeonel raised his head, but he noticed that the Pope's eyes were still half closed. The killing intent wasn't coming from him. Rather, it was coming from the paladins who stood against the walls of the room. It seemed they were completely infuriated by Leonel's actions.\n'Hm?'\nLeonel didn't show much of a reaction to the killing intent. His eyes weren't on the Pope anymore, either.\nLeonel hadn't noticed it before because the room and Pope Margrave was too bright, but behind the throne, there were two young girls standing completely still. Their little feet stood on the cold marbled floors, their bodies adorned with a white gown. Each of them held a flower basket in their hands that held white petals.\nEven from here, Leonel could smell the fragrance coming from the two baskets. It seemed that they were the reason this room seemed to have such an air to it.\nHowever, this wasn't the reason Leonel was caught off guard like this. The main reason was because he recognized one of the girls. In fact, the little girl was also looking toward Leonel with a hint of shock within her large watery eyes.\nThis little girl was the very same little girl who almost caused Leonel to miss out on the Zone entirely. Seeing her familiar blue hair and large blue eyes, Leonel couldn't help but smile. This adorable little girl always seemed to be able to make him smile. Even though she had played the role of obstacle to him, he couldn't bring himself to be mad at such a cute little girl. Maybe this was the advantage of woman.\nThe little girl of the Adurna family blushed seeing Leonel's gaze and her eyes darted around as though looking for somewhere to hide.\nLeonel couldn't help but chuckle, causing the paladins around the room to be shocked. Laughing in such a situation? Did he not want his life anymore? Even the Pope couldn't help but open his eyes just that slight bit more.\nAfter his initial reaction, Leonel realized that this situation might not be too good. If this little girl exposed him, it could be troublesome. Although she couldn't do so directly without exposing herself, there were other ways for her to make insinuations.\nHe wasn't that naive. Though he had taken a liking to this little girl due to her innocence, it wasn't like he didn't realize the danger she posed.\nIn the end, Leonel chose not to worry about it. It was already too late to do much. He could only stay on his guard.\n\"Leonel, correct? Do you know the duties of a Holy Son?\"\nThe Pope finally spoke. To now, the paladins hadn't said a single word out of turn. It was as though they knew their place and would never take a single step out of it.\n\"I do not, Your Holiness. Please advise.\"\nLeonel refocused on the situation at hand.\n\"As the only Holy Son remaining not of the Royal Family, you have a duty to The Church. However, as a commoner, you haven't been taught the schools of religion or of thought. You will enter the Convent as a Canon of The Church.\n\"After serving for 12 years, you will be allowed to earn your way through the rankings of clergymen. Should your performance meet a certain standard, the role of Pope can be handed to you in the future.\"\nLeonel's lip twitched.\nCanon? The Convent? Wasn't this Pope asking him to become a nun?\nAnd serve 12 years? That meant 12 years of fasting and observing religious rituals. And, even after all of that, he would still need to keep his chastity and observe strict rules.\nIf it was just a role he would take in the Zone, it would be fine. After all, Leonel didn't mind acting for a period of time. This Zone was just a fleeting existence, it's not like he would have to remain a virgin for life.\nHowever, it was clear this Pope wanted to lock him away for 12 years. How could Leonel waste so much time? He was already on a time crunch to begin with. If he was locked away like this, he wouldn't be able to accomplish much of anything.\nSo, without hesitation, Leonel shook his head.\n\"I'm sorry, Your Holiness. I have no ambition to become a clergymen.\"\nThe atmosphere went cold once more.",

      "content": "[Schedule will be changing. Updates will be at 10pm EST from now on.]\nPope Margrave opened his eyes fully, peering down toward Leonel from on high.\nThe killing intent locked on Leonel seemed to grow with each passing second of silence. However, once again, it didn't come from the Pope himself, but rather his paladins. Leonel could tell that if it wasn't for their rules of decorum, they would have definitely stepped forward with weapons drawn.\nLeonel's mind spun with several thoughts. It was impossible for him to accept Margrave's request of him. But, at the same time, he couldn't afford to be at odds with The Church either.\n'Lionus described Camelot as having four pillars of power, but I somehow feel that things aren't so simple. It's more likely that there are four powers on the surface, but the knight and mage academy are probably just pawns of the Royal Family and The Church… It might even be possible that both are pawns of the Royal Family to resist The Church…'\nLeonel's eyes narrowed when he had this thought. This was because this wasn't a thought he would originally have. It was the result of a synapse in his Dreamscape.\nAfter a while, Leonel understood why he had come to this conclusion.\nFirst there was Lionus' reaction when he mentioned paladins. It wasn't just his pride in his father Leonel sensed back then. That pride masked a disdain he felt for other paladins.\nSecondly, the Pope's words seemed to imply that Leonel's current circumstances were unacceptable. Though he didn't directly say Leonel had to leave the Mage Academy, Leonel had a faint inkling that it was meant to be tacitly understood.\nThirdly, despite the fact the Pope was a Three Star Magus, even after so many weeks within the Mage Academy, Leonel couldn't sense even the slightest influence of The Church. He had lost count of the number of books he had read in the library to now, yet not a single one even alluded to religion, the Pope, or The Church.\n'I see…'\nLeonel smiled bitterly. It seemed that Lionus had dragged Leonel right into the middle of a power struggle.\nAs things stood now, there was still a bit of balance. Though two of Camelot's three Holy Sons sided with the Royal Family, it was still acceptable. After all, Lionus was King Arthur's son. It was only right that a son would follow after his father's footsteps.\nBut, what about Leonel? What would happen if a fourth Holy Son appeared and still chose not to join the side of The Church?\nThis would put The Church in a weird position. The capital would have four Holy Sons, yet three of them would have nothing to do with them. After so much indoctrination about the importance and superiority of Holy Sons… wouldn't The Church lose much of its influence with the people if so many Holy Sons chose against joining them?\nLeonel suddenly realized that maybe the reason Lamorak had no choice but to let him live wasn't just because he was a Holy Son, but because of the political importance he represented.\nThough it seemed to take Leonel a long time to reach this conclusion, with his Dreamscape and ability, it really took him no more than a split second to grasp everything.\n'In that case…'\n\"Your Holiness, the situation might not be as you expect.\" Leonel spoke slowly.\nToward such words, Pope Margrave finally had the first change in his expression. In fact, even Lionus rose an eyebrow, clearly intrigued.\n\"The truth is that I'm not a Holy Son.\"\nPope Margrave's eyebrow rose. In fact, a hint of a smile played his lips. If Leonel was a woman or liked men, it was definitely the kind of smile that would make his heart skip a bit no matter how slight of a smile it was.\n\"I'm not sure what happened, but Magus Aliard might have made a mistake. I had my affinity tested recently and the result was that I'm an Earth Elemental Childe.\"\nMargrave's expression changed once again.\n\"Oh?\" He said softly.\nLeonel understood then that the information hadn't spread just yet. But, this made sense. Anyone who could have been in the Magic Art Tower at the time Leonel entered was definitely of exceptionally high standing. Not only would they understand the importance of Leonel's position, they were also less likely to gossip to begin with. It made sense that they would choose to remain silent until things settled down.\nLeonel smiled lightly and released his Spirit Pressure.\nA rushing wind swept through the throne room. For a moment, it felt as though Leonel was the center of the world, standing in the eye of a raging storm.\nAt this point, both Lionus and the Pope, and even the paladins to the side, had a change in expression. How was Leonel's Spirit Pressure so powerful?\nToward this, Leonel couldn't do much. He was already holding back. He had already been diligently Crystallizing his Spirit Pressure for a couple weeks already. This was already the result of him holding back. His Spirit Pressure was simply far more than those of this world to begin with. The only thing holding him back was his low grade Force.\nIn the blink of an eye, a simple earthen arrow formed before Leonel. It was just a Two Star Apprentice Art. Leonel could form several dozen of these in an instant if he wanted to. However, the two magi in the room were still shocked by the speed.\nA step further, the speed mgiht have still been acceptable. But, what they found difficult to accept was the metallic sheen on Leonel's [Earthen Arrow]. It was very clear that not only was he an Earth Childe… he was a variant! And a very powerful variant at that!\nHowever, Leonel hadn't done this just to show off. He had a very clear purpose.\n\"As you can see, Your Holiness, I believe there was some kind of mistake. I tried learning Light Elemental Arts, but I wasn't very good at it. In fact, it takes me several minutes to form a One Star Apprentice Light Art. It would be impossible for me to use in battle.\"\nThe Pope's eyes narrowed and the room turned still once more.",

      "content": "The silence was suffocating. Even the paladins no longer had the presence of mind to continue pressing Leonel. They could all only wait for Pope Margrave's response.\n\"… You're a very intelligent boy.\" Pope Margrave finally said.\nMargrave's face practically read like 'I know you're spewing bullshit, but I like it'.\nWhen Spirit Pressure reaches a certain level, it becomes capable of forming many elements. Of course, the efficiency to which it's done is far less than one's main element, but this is true nonetheless.\nHow could Margrave believe that Leonel took a minute to form a mere One Star Apprentice Art? That was nothing but bullshit.\nBut, despite the fact it was bullshit, it was bullshit the Pope happened to like.. As long as Leonel continued to be this 'intelligent', there wouldn't have to be any problems between them.\n\"Camelot is truly blessed to have another Childe, and such a powerful one at that. This Seat just wanted to see the future generation today.? Now that I've seen, it's truly as the old say. The young will eventually surpass us all.\"\nPope Margrave gave Leonel a deep look. Then, he waved a hand, his eyes returning to their half closed position.\nA familiar paladin separated from his position against the wall, leading Leonel and Lionus out.\nLeonel's eyes narrowed when the large double doors closed behind, blocking out those blinding lights.\n'What a cunning man…'\nLet alone sighing a breath of relief, Leonel was several levels more cautious.\nThough he had held back, he hadn't exposed his Spirit Pressure without cause. In this world, Leonel had learned that sometimes logic wasn't more important than one's strength. It wasn't until Leonel exposed his power that Margrave's treatment of him truly changed. If he wasn't as strong as he was now, there was no telling whether Pope Margrave would have accepted his reasonings.\nLeonel made a note in his heart. Mordred might not be his only enemy in this place.\n…\n\"You know him?\"\nNot long after Leonel left, Margrave suddenly spoke to seemingly empty air. The paladins didn't react at all, but Little Nana felt somewhat flustered by this line of questioning.\n\"No, no!\" Nana quickly answered.\nShe wasn't worried her flustered appearance would give away anything. After all, this was her normal state. Plus, Leonel looked toward her first before she reacted, so it could be said that she was just shocked by the sudden attention Leonel gave her.\n\"Hm, is that so…?\"\nMargrave didn't say anything for a long while before he continued to speak.\n\"It seems that this boy is quite lustful. This could be used…\"\nNana flushed red with embarrassment.\nMargrave chuckled. \"Don't worry, you are among my precious Holy Daughters and God has bestowed upon you a heaven sent ability. How could I pass down such a debasing job to you? You must remain pure beneath the scrutiny of God. There will of course be others to take on this task…\"\nAfter he finished saying this, Margrave didn't speak again.\nIf Leonel was here, maybe he wouldn't be able to hold back his rage any longer.\nIt might be normal for a young girl like Nana to marry and even birth children in this world, but Leonel had no such thoughts about the little girl.\n**\n\"So the mission sets off in at dusk, will you be ready?\"\nAfter leaving The Church, Lionus pretended as though nothing had happened and began to speak with Leonel about the mission once again.\nLeonel gave him a sidelong look.\nThis prince had brought up this trip to The Church as though it was any other day. In fact, they way he spoke about it initially, he made it sound like this had something to do with the mission he had taken up. Not only that, but he had even made it seem like he had some involvement with The Church.\nIf Leonel remembered correctly, Lionus spoke about this visit as though it was something every Holy Son did, when this very clearly wasn't the case.\nLionus smiled shamelessly beneath Leonel's gaze. He was clearly saying that he took no responsibility for his previous actions.\n\"You're pretty good, Your Highness.\" Leonel said with a tinge of sarcasm.\nLionus chuckled. \"I'm not sure what you mean, Leonel.\"\n\"Mm.\" Leonel mumbled but didn't say much else.\nIt was true that it wouldn't have helped even if the prince had said something. Though it would have been nice to know, it would have also been akin to the prince making a decision for Leonel.\nBy keeping his hands off the sequence entirely, not only was Lionus able to gain an understanding of where Leonel's loyalties lied, he was also able to test Leonel.\nHowever, never had he expected Leonel to be so capable. Even he couldn't have thought of a better solution to the situation.\nLeonel shoook his head and decided to forget it.\n\"What is this mission about?\"\nHearing this question, Lionus finally grew serious.\n\"It's a border mission.\"\nSeeing that Leonel didn't have a particular reaction, Lionus almost smacked his own forehead. He had forgotten that Leonel had never been on a mission before, so how could he know just how damning the two words 'border mission' were?\nLionus sighed and began to explain.\n\"Camelot has a 'Ring of Safety' system. The safest place is the core of the Kingdom. This encompasses Camelot and the surround hundred or so mile radius. Beyond that is the Yellow Mission Ring. This encompasses between a hundred to five hundred miles.\n\"Normally, those missions are taken up be Apprentice Mages. They deal with small beast hordes, bandits, small rebellions and the like.\n\"Beyond the Yellow Mission Ring is the Red Mission Ring. This is between 500 miles and 600 miles away from the core of the Kingdom. These missions can only be touched by Official Mages. The rebellions that happen here are much fiercer and the bandits form Clans and small fiefs of their own, making them much more dangerous.\n\"Beyond the Red Mission Ring is the Black Mission Ring. This is between 600 and 800 miles away from the core of the Kingdom. Only elite Official Mages and weaker Magi can take missions in this region.\n\"The Black Mission Ring are where the first instances of Demons and black magic can be found. Some of the worst criminals of Camelot are hiding away in this region. The death toll is high enough to surpass 20%.\"\nLeonel frowned. It was this serious?\n\"Beyond the Black Mission Ring… is the Border Mission Ring. It goes by another name… The Demon Mission Ring. It's between 800 to 1000 miles from the core of the Kingdom. This region is the no man's land between Camelot and the Demon Kingdom. There are constant clashes between us and Mordred's Demon Army there.\n\"That is where our mission lies.\"\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath. But, he knew he had to go.\nHe knew that the side missions weren't meaningless. This was a Zone, not? a video game. Since side missions existed, they served a purpose. They acted like a guiding light to how to complete the main mission.\nSince he was going to the Demon Mission Ring, it was a good chance to see whether or not he could kill Mordred in one sweep.",

      "content": "Leonel touched his sore bottom again. He had already lost count of the number of times he had done so, but the discomfort hadn't disappeared.\nSeeing Leonel do this again, Lionus couldn't help but snicker. Though he quickly tried to hide it, Leonel wouldn't miss such a thing with how sharp his senses were. He could only send a glare toward the Crown Prince.\nUnfortunately, this glare only made Lionus' withheld laughter burst forth like a torrential tide.\n\"If others knew the great Earthen Childe Leonel couldn't handle riding a horse for a few hours, just how would they react?\"\nLionus' laughter continued as though he couldn't sense Leonel's piercing glare.\nIt had already been a few days since Leonel, Lionus and the rest of the expedition squad had set out to the Border Region.\nLeonel still remembered his shock when he saw the teleportation arrays Camelot had built.. But, after a moment, it was relatively easy to accept. After all, if a Tier 9 Black treasure could provide a talisman capable of taking Aina to a new world, it wasn't too shocking that a world with several Magi could find methods to teleport within a world.\nAfter his initial shock settled down, Leonel laughed at himself. He had seen all of the Mage Arts within the Magic Art Tower. Some of them had abilities he couldn't have even fathomed back when he was a normal human. Something like teleportation shouldn't have been so surprising.\nUnfortunately, despite the existence of teleportation channels, Leonel had still had to ride a horse in the last few days.\nFor safety, the teleportation channels to Camelot and from Camelot stopped appearing frequently after the Red Mission Ring and there were sparingly few within the Black Mission Ring. As for the Border Region, there were none. So, after reaching the last channel, Leonel, Lionus and the rest of the group had to travel by horse.\nBut… Leonel hadn't even touched a horse in his lifetime before. In fact, he couldn't remember ever being close to one, let alone having to ride it uncomfortably for hours.\nIn truth, Leonel could just use a simple healing spell to stop the soreness, but after his conversation with the Pope, he didn't dare to use Light Elemental magic in public anymore. And, it seemed Lionus was too busy laughing at him to help out.\nThe rest of the squad seemed to be taking this quite well as well. It was rare to get some laughs during a Border Region Mission, so they felt a bit relaxed after making Leonel the butt of the joke.\nLionus smiled inwardly. 'What an interesting guy… I know he's not a person who gets embarrassed so easily. The only explanation is that he's becoming the butt of the joke on purpose to ease the tension…'\nLionus found Leonel to be an interesting character to analyze. Whenever he thought he understood him, things would turn out to be much different from what he had expected. Leonel had layers to him that were exceptionally difficult to peel back.\nThe team this time was formed by five members including Lionus and Leonel. Aside from them, there were three Leonel recognized — Mary, Theybul, and finally, Elys.\nIt was only after seeing them all that Leonel understood the true reason behind their robes lacking embroidery. Mages and Magi who frequented battlefields wouldn't give more information about themselves to the enemy than was necessary. In fact, Leonel realized that their robes might not even necessarily reflect their true levels.\nDue to this reason, Leonel also wore plain blue robes without any embroidery and he understood just a bit more about the world he was in.\nSuddenly, the laughing atmosphere grew serious. Lionus, the leader of this squad, didn't need to say anything. They could see by the land that stretched out before them that they were here.\nThe line of separation was so stark that it almost seemed surreal. On one side, there were blades of green grass. Though these blades lacked in health and were even browning in several spots, they were ultimately still blades of grass.\nHowever, on the other side, there was nothing but grey, cracked lands. Every so often, there would be what seemed like patches of vegetation, but they all resembled weeds and were colored such a deep black that it was impossible to call them plants of any sort.\nThe world across this clear line was covered by a thin veil of fog. In the distance, sharp mountain ranges towered, piercing through the black clouds above. A light drizzle perpetually fell over the grey lands, yet its soil remained just as dry. In fact, the rain held an odd sent to it that made Leonel's nose twitch.\n'It's acidic…' Leonel's frown deepened.\n\"Leonel, you take the vanguard. Mary, Theybul, protect his sides and flank our formation. Elys, take up the rear.\"\nLeonel nodded. His arrangement made the most sense.\nSince Leonel was an Earth Mage, it made sense for him to take the vanguard. His defenses and crowd controlling abilities were the highest. In addition, his Spirit Pressure was also the highest, so could scout ahead as well.\nLionus was their main healer, so he should be protected in the middle.\nElys was a Mental Mage, so her attack strength was the least. Taking up the rear allowed her to use her sharper senses to ensure they didn't get pincered while also allowing her the time needed to launch her assaults of the mind, just like her mentor Magus Aliard.\nMary was a Wood Mage while Theybul was a Wind Mage. Though their abilities didn't allow for a special allocation, this was the best place to put them.\nLeonel took a deep breath and entered a focused state. The expressions of his teammates changed sensing the shift in his aura. They felt that it was slightly difficult to breathe, but they also sighed in relief when they realized the aura wasn't pointed toward them.\nLionus' eyes narrowed slightly, watching Leonel's back.\n'He… isn't doing it on purpose… Just how many secrets do you have?'\nLeonel took a step forward, crossing into the grey lands that bordered the two behemoths of this world.\nAn uncomfortable feeling seeped into his body immediately. It was similar to a muscle ache or a minor cold. Though it was nothing too severe, it still made Leonel all the more serious.\nThe light drizzle of rain rebounded across his body and robes as though trying to ebb away at his psyche.\nWithout a choice, he continued to walk forward.\nWhat he didn't know was that there was a subtle change to his Segmented Cube.\nAll the while, sitting within Leonel's spatial bracelet, it passively absorbed energy. Even after Leonel stepped into this no-man's land, it never stopped. However, this energy was different.\nIt carried a tinge of blackness to it, seeping into the Lab Setting, toward the snowglobes, and into the resting place of the little mink…",

Even with a beast standing at three meters tall before him, he hardly react.\n\"[Mud Pit].\"\nLeonel stretched out a hand. The land quaked and shook as the black rhino charged over. In the blink of an eye, it had already entered a 100 meter radius.\nJust when it was about to press its front feet down, it suddenly felt its footing disappear. Instead of hitting solid ground, it sank into a quagmire, causing its body to flip forward..\n\"[Harden].\"\nJust as the rhino's body was about to flip out of the mud pit entirely, the pit hardened. The sudden change caused the rhino, who was in the process of rolling off, to come to a sudden stop.\nAt that moment, the sickening sound of shattering bones rang out, only to be completely overshadowed by the pained roar of the black rhino.\nThe black rhino heavily landed on its back, its front legs snapped in two. In fact, a portion of its legs were still stuck in the hardened mud pit.\nHowever, Leonel hardly reacted, a familiar swirl of wind had already surged around his body once again.\nA strong Earth Element swirled in the air above the rhino, quickly coalescing into a bronze, angled blade that radiated a beautiful light.\n\"[Heavy Guillotine].\"\nSHUUUU!\nThe blade descended into the rhino's open mouth. It was too busy roaring in pain to even sense the danger.\nAn instant later, its mouth was pierced through to the back of its skull, leaving it impaled into the ground.\nBy this point, Leonel's teammates were looking at his back as though he was some kind of monster. This wasn't the first Demon Leonel had taken down. In fact, it wasn't even the tenth. Yet, every time they saw him do it, they would feel just as shocked as the first time.\nThat beast was at least as powerful as a One Star Magus. Wasn't Leonel just an Official Mage? They should have been working together to take it down, so what the hell was happening?\n'Hm, this power scaling system is alright. But, still not perfect. It's too broad now… It needs some tweaks…'\nLeonel calmly analyzed.\n'That battle was at most 72% efficient. It would have been much easier to finish that battle had I taken a different approach.\n'If I had used [Gravity Warp] just after the rhino flipped due to [Mud Pit], I could have used [Earthen Spike] to impale it beneath its own weight… [Earthen Spike] is only a Two Star Official Art, it would take much less to cast than the One Star Magus Art [Heavy Guillotine], even if I have to take into account the Three Star Official Art [Gravity Warp]…'\nLeonel wasn't really worried about his stamina usage. Even compared to true Three Star Magi, his stamina was far beyond what they could imagine. After all, he technically had the reserves of a Fifth Dimensional mage. The only shame was that he had to use more of his spirit to form Magic Arts since he hadn't crystallized his Spirit Pressure as thoroughly as the true elites of this world.\nBut, even then, his starting point was still so much higher that it hardly mattered.\nLeonel was seriously refining his Dreamscape bit by bit. He wanted to reach a point where he could understand the best way to defeat an enemy the moment he laid eyes on it. Unfortunately, it was clear that he was still very far from this result.\n72% efficiency might sound impressive, but Leonel knew that this was pitifully low. For one, the more efficiency he wanted to eek out, the more difficult it would be. But, this wasn't even the biggest point…\nThe truth was that the rhino was much weaker than Leonel. Not only was it much weaker, but it was much less intelligent than Leonel. The petty tricks Leonel used might work on it, but on a True Demon or another Magus, it would be nothing more than parlor tricks.\nLeonel believed that had the black rhino been just any other One Star Magus, Leonel would at best be able to wring out a measely 30-40% efficiency, 50% if he was lucky and could counter his enemy's ability. It would be even worse the closer to his strength the enemy was.\nSuddenly thinking of this, another light bulb went off in Leonel's mind as a branching arc of lightning surged through his Dream World.\n'Counters… It might not be possible to perfectly counter every enemy I come across… An Earth Mage would be the bane of a Wind Mage, but might not necessarily do well against others… Hm…'\nLeonel thought that there was merit to this idea. However, he didn't have a perfect way to act on it currently. Though he could technically cast all Elemental spells thanks to his talent, he knew that this wasn't a viable solution.\nThe power system of Camelot would only be useful to him in the Third Dimension. It would lose its use the moment he crossed into the Fourth. So, that solution would only be short lived. He needed to think of something better.\n\"Leonel, you're a monster. Do you know that?\" Theybul suddenly spoke in a somewhat exasperated tone.\nThey all thought after the first beast Leonel took down that he would soon realize he couldn't expend his stamina so wildly. But, the current Leonel looked like he was still on his first battle. It was too ridiculous.\nOriginally, they had been accepting of Leonel joining this expedition for two reasons. Firstly, Lionus recommended him. And, secondly, they heard rumors that he had battled a Knight of the Round Table and came out alive.\nIn their minds, even if Leonel's magic wasn't up to standard, he could make up for it in other ways. But, they had never expected for him to be such a monster even when only using Magic Arts.\n\"Uh —.\" Leonel didn't know how to respond to this.\nLionus and the others chuckled seeing his response. They had expected the atmosphere to become heavy after entering these lands, but Leonel's prowess took a burden off their hearts.\nIt wasn't that they couldn't defeat the beasts Leonel could as well. They all knew that these 'Demons' were easy pickings. The True Demons were far more powerful and were humanoids. But, Leonel let them all save up their stamina and remain in peak condition. This was more than they could ever hope for.\n\"It seems like we've arrived at our destination.\"\nLionus said in a somewhat surprised tone. He had expected it to take about a week, but this was only the third day.\nHe sent another deep look toward Leonel's back. He had realized that Leonel sometimes swerved their formation in certain directions, but he didn't think much of it. But, it seemed that Leonel was avoiding danger for them at the same time as taking the vanguard.\n'A monster indeed…'\nUp ahead, a small, makeshift fort stood. The gates were made of black wood and stood about three meters tall. Peaking over the wooden walls one could see several tall tents from the distance.\nSeveral patrol units stood between them and the small fort. They had already passed through several lookout checkpoints, so the Commander of this fort should already be prepared for their arrival.\nAs expected, before they could even approach, the gates opened and a small troop of knights riding war horses galloped forward.\nLeonel winced. 'Damn horses again…'\nAs Leonel was remembering his past trauma, he didn't notice that Lionus had begun to frown behind him.\n'Something's wrong…'",

      "content": "After a moment, Leonel regained his serious expression. Once he did, his senses quickly picked up on a few things.\nFirst, the small squad of four riding war horses toward them was led by a man with billowing blond hair and blue eyes that held a complex light within them.\nSecondly, according to what he knew about Lionus, it was impossible for him not to take the helm in greeting these knights. This wasn't because the Prince felt the need to take control of everything, but rather because Leonel felt that Lionus was a man who placed emphasis on relationships and respect, not much unlike Leonel himself.\nFor a man like Lionus, as the leader of their squad, he would of course observe proper etiquette and greet these knights of Camelot. After all, in the future when he was named King, these men would be the backbone of the Kingdom. And, even now, they were putting their lives on the line, fighting day in and day out In the most dangerous border regions.\nYet, not only had Lionus not stepped forward, he even seemed reluctant to do so. It wasn't that he hadn't thought of doing so, but that he was reluctant to do so.\n.\nAfter reaching this conclusion, Leonel observed the man coming toward them once again and immediately noticed something else. This man's strength… even faintly surpassed Lamorak's!\nAt that moment, noticing his looks, Leonel had a faint inkling of something.\n'Please don't tell me he's Lancelot…'\nLeonel felt another headache coming on.\nLeonel shook his head. 'Things still shouldn't be so simple. I don't believe that even if things are as I think they are that Lionus would be so unable to hide his emotions. This is even doubly so for a Knight of the Round Table like Lancelot.'\nWhen Leonel had this thought, he began to calmly observe everything else.\nTwo of the knights who followed Lancelot out had deadpan expression, but the third had a gaze that reminded Leonel of a snake. He calmly looked Lionus up and down as though he was measuring up goods in a flea market.\nIt was difficult to tell anything else from his gaze, but for some reason, he didn't have eyes for anyone else. Even the two beauties — Elys and Mary — had no ability to catch his attention.\nThere was something off about his gaze, but Leonel couldn't put his finger on it. Could the oddity be related to this man?\nHe had long, black hair that shimmered as though coated in a thin gel. His eyes were the very same deep black, reflecting an indifferent light. To his hips, two swords hung. But, they were obscenely long to the point they almost dragged along the ground even while he road his tall horse.\nThe longer Leonel looked at him, but louder his primitive instincts screamed. This man…\nHe was dangerous.\nAs though feeling a gaze on him, the young man finally shifted his gaze from Lionus, locking eyes with Leonel. In that moment, Leonel felt as though his body had been dunked into a vat of ice water. His blood vessels involuntarily constricted even as his eyes narrowed.\nLeonel's heartbeat slowed to a crawl. Though their gazes only met for a split second, it felt like an eternity.\nThe man seemed surprised that Leonel didn't try his best to look away as soon as possible. It made him give Leonel a once over, trying to see whether there was something special about the young man before him.\nUnfortunately, at that moment, their silent clash had to come to an end.\n\"Crown Prince, you've come.\"\nLancelot, heading the small squad, took the initiative to hop down from his horse, kneeling down to a single knee in greeting.\n'Maybe I shouldn't keep subconsciously thinking he's Lancelot. Who knows, I might get lucky and dodge this mess…'\n\"Please don't do this, Sir Lancelot. I'm not worthy of such respect.\"\n'Or not…' Leonel smiled bitterly.\nLancelot stood with an amiable smile, looking over the rest of the group.\n\"Oh, is this Official Mage Leonel? I've heard a lot about you. That old fogie Lamorak suffered at your hands, huh?\"\nThe man with snake-like eyes narrowed his gaze at these words. It seemed he was only now learning of Leonel's identity.\nLeonel smiled, a bit embarrassed.\n\"I guess you could say his mace was a bit dirtied by my blood.\"\nLancelot was a bit stunned by Leonel's response for a moment before he erupted into a boisterous laughter.\nIt was quite an odd sight to see. Lancelot, with his looks, could play the part of arrogant and pretty playboy perfectly. Yet, he erupted with the same laughter one would expect from a man with wild facial hair and a massive gut.\n'Damn, his charisma is affecting even me. No wonder Queen Guinevere fell for him…'\nIf others knew what Leonel was thinking, he'd probably get sentenced to death where he stood.\nLancelot heavily patted Leonel's shoulder. \"I like you, kid.\"\nClearly, he wasn't as reserved toward Leonel as he was toward Lionus.\n\"Sir Lancelot, is this base experiencing some issues? I noticed that the security was especially high?\"\nLionus finally asked the question that had been bothering him. Of course, these weren't at the forefront of his mind, but he could only toss other things to the back.\n\"Mm, yes.\" Lancelot grew serious. \"The Demon Lords have been on the move.\"\nLionus grew serious.\nThe Demon Lords. They were Modred's most trusted subordinates. There were 66 of them in total.\nIt wasn't that Modred didn't add more, but that Demon Lords would rather slaughter one another to claim their positions. As a result, new Demon Lords would always kill another Demon Lord upon being conferred their title, or die trying. In the end, the number would always be 66.\nBut, even then, these were many more top experts than Camelot had. If it wasn't for the fact the top experts of Camelot out stripped those of this demonic land by a measure, Camelot would have long since been wiped out.\nLionus frowned. \"What happened?\"\nLancelot took a deep breath. \"A new Demon Lord has been appointed. However, this one didn't follow the normal tradition of killing another, causing some unrest within Modred's lands. Now there are 67 Demon Lords, but Modred seems to have taken a liking to this new appointee and is protecting them.\n\"There's unrest in their ranks now. But, Demons don't display their disatisfaction in the same way we humans do. Rather than pointing their spears toward Modred, they're ignoring the status quo and attacking on their own whim.\n\"Modred has yet to step in to regain the balance and it's possible that she wants this sort of unrest. Due to this, we've been dealing with constant attacks toward all the border forts. News has already been sent back to Camelot. It's likely that the other big players will be making a move now…\"\nJust when Lancelot wanted to say more, the ground suddenly began to quake.",

      "content": "[Schedule will be changing. Updates will be at 10pm EST from now on.]\nLeonel had never expected that he wouldn't even get a chance to rest.\nA whirlwind of orders and roars shook the small fort. Lancelot's carefree demeanor completely vanished as he took hold of the situation. This fort was his own to control.\nThe truth was that this base was in far better condition than the others would be. With a Knight of the Round Table protecting it, those stations here were several levels luckier than they otherwise might be.\nThis was the first time Leonel had ever been on a true battlefield. Though he had fought the Englishmen alongside the French, those men were so much weaker than him that his life was never truly on the line. This was especially so when it was considered that Aina had been by his side..\nBut this time, if he was just a bit careless, even a foot soldier could take his life. The warriors of this world were on a completely different level. He simply couldn't afford to take any of them lightly.\nFor some reason, though… Leonel felt and urge to take the vanguard.\nEven he was shocked by this sudden change in his psyche. The thumping of his heart reminded him of the first time he stepped onto a football field. It was the very same feeling, that will to conquer and pit his wits against that of the enemy.\nHowever, all this time, such a thing had been repressed to the depths of his heart. He simply didn't like to kill. Such contradictory feelings always clashed within him to the point his initial instincts were tempered and snuffed out.\nBut… the enemy was once again not human.\nLeonel suddenly smiled.\nHe remembered charging toward the beast kings of the Project Hunt island. Back then, he had felt the fetters of his heart release a bit. After all, back then, his enemy was an army of beasts. And now… his enemy was an army of Demons.\nLeonel stood on the walls of the fort. The black wood felt exceptionally smooth beneath his feet. As a mage, it was only right that he stood at the back of the army. It was his job to observe a formation of Earth Mages and understand their procedure for future battles. But he was feeling especially agitated. He wanted to join the knights below.\nA synpase went off in Leonel's Dream World. When he sent his mind inward, he smiled bitterly.\n'So it's like that…'\nIn the sky of his Dream World sat his Dreamscape. Within it, arcs of lightning connected his memories of battle with Lamorak to a book titled 'Achieving a Smooth Spirit'.\nIt was a level seven book, one at the limit of what Leonel was allowed to read currently. It was a theory speaking on the connection of one's mentality to their Spirit Pressure.\nIn truth, it seemed like a crackpot theory, maybe similar to the holistic medicine of Earth. Though some people believe in it, many dismiss it as a ridiculous notion. Even Leonel hadn't thought much about it before… But right now, he understood where these feelings of agitation were coming from.\nHis battle with Lamorak had left a shadow on his heart. It was impeding the pure flow of his spirit and limiting his future path. As a result, Leonel subconsciously wanted to prove himself on a real battlefield….\nLeonel took a deep breath and closed his eyes.\nIf others knew his thoughts, they'd believe he thought too much of himself. Lamorak was one of the four or five most powerful knights of Camelot. His age was easily three or four times that of Leonel's, maybe even more. It was only right that he defeated Leonel. Was Leonel even worthy to have such a shadow over his heart?\nThe fact such an impediment to his spirit existed was practically Leonel saying that he subconsciously placed himself on the same level as Lamorak or maybe even a higher level.\nTo do something subconsciously was to say that Leonel believed this to the depths of his soul. He wasn't faking it, it was a confidence etched into his bones.\nLeonel chuckled to himself, causing the mages who were incredibly tense to his side to look toward him with shock.\nIn the distance, a vile army of Demons surged forward like a tide.\nBlack dogs with long grey tongues as rough as sand paper. Grey skinned humanoids with all sorts of horns and antlers on their heads. Scaled humanoids with reptillian eyes. Grotesque vultures looming in the skies with wrinkled, rotting skin…\nIt was a scene right out of hell. Yet, this young man was laughing? Had he lost his mind?\nLeonel's blood rushed through his veins. He felt his bronze Runes flicking into and out of existence. He could hardly control himself.\nLeonel's eyes were like hawks, he automatically locked onto three Demon Lords in the distance.\nOne was a massive minotaur carrying a bloodied ax. The tips of its horns were a deep, obsidian black, making it look as though it had been dripped in poison continuously.\nThe second was a skeleton with blue flames for eyes. It wore a ragged black robe that couldn't hide the chains around its ankles and wrists. At the end of its chains there were massive heavy balls of black steel. Their weight were so substantial that they left long, deep trenches in the ground as the skeleton walked forward.\nThe last was a zombie with rotting greenish grey skin. It wore nothing but a torn beast cloth to protect its groin. As for the rest of it, it was completely exposed. Leonel could even seen the lines of muscle fibers beneath its shedding skin. However, instead of these muscles being a healthy pink, they looked completely washed out to the point of nearly being white as though this zombie had not an ounce of blood left in its body.\nDespite their grotesque appearance, Leonel could feel that their auras were billowing into the skies. They weren't as powerful as Lamorak or Lancelot, but the difference wasn't so large either.\nThe more Leonel looked toward them, the greater the thumping of his heart became.\nEventually, his heartbeat became so loud that those beside him could hear it. It felt as though his heart would leap from his chest any moment now.\nLeonel's aura towered into the skies. As though competing with the three Demon Lords before it, it shot into the rumbling black clouds above, even dispersing the ever falling rain for just a moment.\nLeonel could feel it. If he didn't step forward now, his blood would run in reverse. This feeling… he couldn't hold it down anymore.\nMilitary law? He simply didn't care.\nSeveral eyes landed on Leonel. Some were friendly and others were from the enemy army. However, he didn't have eyes for any of them.\nThe blood surged throughout Leonel's body. It churned and spun, shooting into his chest.\nHis lungs expanded, a mighty roar that seemed to drown out everything erupting from within him.\nA blinding light lit Leonel's eyes. By the time they dimmed, his eyes reflected a beautiful violet tinged with just the slightest hint of red.\nThen…\nHe leapt from the walls of the fort.",

      "content": "Leonel tore through the skies, treading through the air with two steps that sent him flying forward several hundred meters. Before anyone could react, he had already landed in the no man's land between the two armies.\nLeonel had no idea what was going on around him. He could hear anything but the blood rushing through his ears. He couldn't feel anything but the wild thumping of his heart. He couldn't see anything but the endless stream of enemies before him.\nHis mage robes were sheered apart under the pressure, revealing a toned torso pulsing with blinding bronze runes and radiating a beautiful violet color.\nLeonel's palm flipped over, a spear appearing in it as he shot forward.\n'[Rising Pillar].'\nThe earth beneath his feet trembled, shooting up at an angle beneath Leonel's feet.. A swirl of surging Force surrounded Leonel as he formed the Magic Art, using pillar that manifested beneath him to fly forward at ever faster speeds.\nIn the blink of an eye, he had already reached the first line of monsters, demons and ghouls. Compared to the army, he seemed like an insignificant ant. Yet, even the Demons who didn't know fear or pain felt their chests being pressed down by an undying pressure.\nBANG!\nThe earth before Leonel surged upward, forming a massive wedge that slammed into the front of the demon army.\nShattered bodies flew out from the point of impact like broken kites. Their desecrated corpses paved a bloody path for Leonel to step forward.\nLeonel's piercing violet-red eyes shone forth like two impossible to stop beams. He became the only light in this bleak land, a halo of bronze-violet light hanging above his head.\n\"[Grand Gravity Warp]!\"\nThe earth beneath Leonel feet sunk down by several inches. An invisible weight descended from the skies, crushing the bodies of every demon within tens of meters of him.\nLeonel shot into the army, his spear leaving trailing snakes of sharp air in its wake.\nIn the distance, those of Camelot's army finally reacted to what they were seeing.\nLionus' expression changed several times. '… This madman…'\n\"… Prince… Are you seeing what I'm seeing…?\"\nAs a Light Magus, Lionus obviously didn't have a squad of mages to join like Leonel had. His job was to go to the places of the battlefield where he was needed. As a result, he had a security detail of his own and had separated from Leonel.\nAt that moment, Mary was speechless watching Leonel. They all felt that Leonel had lost his mind.\nThey had seen many weird reactions to stepping on the battlefield for the first time. Some vomited, others cowered in fear, some couldn't stop the shaking of their limbs and others even tried to abandon the battle entirely.\nBut… charging head long into battle… this was the first time they had ever seen such a thing…\nLancelot sat on his war horse with a stunned expression. In all his years, this was the first time he had seen such a thing as well.\nThe truth was that such actions by Leonel were enough to be punished by military law, maybe even death. Breaking rank and doing as one pleased wasn't the way of the army. This wasn't only the case on Earth, but clearly also the case in this Mythological Zone.\nHowever, though Earth and this Zone were similar, they were different in one aspect: the importance of strength.\nWho dared to reprimand Leonel? Even if Lancelot had the strength to do so, would he? Was it worth it?\nAt that moment, Lancelot boisterously laughed into the skies. The golden-silver lance that hung to his sides rose in his hands.\nHe pointed it forward, drawing an invisible line between himself and the army before them.\n\"You see that men, even a rookie is so eager. We won't lose out to him, will we?!\"\nHis roar pierced through the veil above. The rumbling hooves of war horses and the sound of weapons clanging against armor shot through the battlefield.\nThe aura of Camelot's army rose. As though trying to match Leonel's energy, it melded with his momentum, suppressing the demons to an extreme.\n\"CHARGE!\"\nLancelot's words fell and a see of knights shot forward. The front hooves of their steeds rose, trampling the ground beneath them with impunity.\nTo a side, the snake-eyed man watched on with a curious gaze. He looked toward Leonel's back as though it was right in front of him.\nFrom his position, he could see every defined muscle of Leonel's back, every sharp, perfectly formed bronze Rune, and even saw the beads of sweat perspiring from him.\n\"Interesting…\"\nThe two long swords to his side trembled as though feeling excited. They cried out as though they were wishing for blood too.\nWithout another moment of waiting, he too shot forward.\nIn the front of it all, Leonel had no idea how he had affected the army to his back. He controlled the earth beneath his feet like a god of war and wielded his spear like the call of a reaper.\nHis movements were like fluid water, his steps carrying an enigmatic air to them that made it seem as though all his enemies were walking into their deaths of their own volition.\nSurprisingly, aside from their gazes being aimed toward him, the Demon Lords didn't make any other action toward Leonel. One would think that they would go all out to snuff out his momentum, but they didn't seem to care to do so.\nThey looked on with complete indifference. However, they suddenly frowned when Leonel's gaze met their own because… His gaze, too, was indifferent!\nHe didn't see them as Demon Lords. He saw them as enemies he needed to cut down to get rid of this uncomfortable feeling in his heart. They were his outlet to vent, nothing more, nothing less!\nAt that moment, the other high rankers of the demon army began to move. Demon Lords might have been the highest standard, but beneath them there were still Demon Soldiers, Demon Captains and Demon Generals.\nWhy should their Demon Lord be the first to step up just to deal with a small fry ant of a human? For someone like Leonel, a Demon Captain was more than enough!\nFeeling very confident in himself, a wolf man standing on its two strong hind legs shot toward Leonel. A rotting tongue hung out of its mouth, grotesque saliva dripping downward as it dreamed about Leonel's tender flesh.\nHowever, it had hardly begun to target Leonel when a spear appeared before it, piercing through its tongue, mouth and through the back of its head.\nLike that, a Demon Captain fell no differently from a rabid dog.\nFinally… The Demon Generals were stirred.",

      "content": "\"What a boisterous kid. Since when did my demon army become so easy to bully?\"\nA Demon General with empty sockets flickering with a green flames sneered. If it wasn't for this feature, he would look completely like a normal human male of average appearance. But, with it, it couldn't be more clear that he was a demon with a sinister temperament.\nThe green flame Demon General stepped toward Leonel, two scimitars twirling in his hands.\nAt that moment, Camelot's army met the demons, their clash ringing throughout the battlefield. Rain continued to drizzle, the clouds above seemingly becoming denser and blacker with each passing moment. Yet, Leonel didn't seem to notice anything at all. Even the several Demon Generals coming toward him were nothing more than another reflection in his mind.\nThe raging torrent of his blood flowed quicker with each passing moment. His skin reddened, causing a light steam to rise from his body beneath the cool atmosphere..\n\"Die!\"\nTwo scimitars crossed across Leonel's neck, seemingly trying to sever his head from his shoulders from two directions at once.\nLeonel's mind was exceptionally calm. It was as though he didn't realize his life was on the line.\nThe green flame Demon General sneered deeply, looking toward Leonel as though he was a dead man. But, when he met the coldness of Leonel's violet-red eyes, he felt a shiver tear its way up his spine.\nLeonel's spear shot forward.\nJust when it seemed the scimitars would rip his head from his body, Leonel's spear, as though drawn on a perfect line, connected with the intersecting line of the two scimitars, repelling them both with a single strike.\nAs the green flame Demon General felt an unstoppable force surge up his arms, causing him to take several steps backward, he felt a deep fear take root in his heart.\nUsing the tip of a spear to intercept two weapons at once. Just a single mistake would have meant Leonel losing his head. Just what level of character did he provoke?\nThe green flame Demon General immediately retreated by several steps. He knew it was impossible for him to defeat Leonel on his own. If he didn't get help, he would only be rushing to his death.\nThe Demon General had expected that Leonel would press him, but he was stunned and then enraged by Leonel's next actions.\nAs though he was air, Leonel didn't even pursue the Demon General, he sent out several more piercing strikes of his spear, compressing [Call of the Wind] to an extreme. The green flame Demon General could only watch as his soldiers fell one after another.\nSeveral Demon Generals began to swarm the area. It couldn't be helped. Leonel was a lone man too far gone from the true front line of Camelot's army. He was alone, swarmed by enemies from all sides.\nThings like formations, ranks, and military law were meaningless to demons. If they saw an opponent they wanted, even crossing from one side of the army to the other wasn't outside of reason to them. Even when they saw the green flame Demon General suffer by a measure, it only lit their fighting spirit all the more.\nThe green flame Demon General tried to send attacks toward Leonel from a distance, hoping to slow down his murder spree.\nScythes of green Force tore through the air, flying toward Leonel at unbelievable speeds.\nYet, Leonel calmly sidestepped them all. It was as though he knew where they would land ahead of time and had already moved in the opposite direction.\nLeonel's General Star abilities deepened with each passing day. Others would need several battles over decades for even the smallest improvement, but those were individuals without Leonel's ability. A movement theory like General Star was practically created for Leonel!\n\"Prince, this isn't good. This is Leonel's first battle, what is he going to do when his stamina runs dry?\"\nTheybul asked with a bit of worry from Lionus' side.\nThey all knew how insane Leonel's stamina was, but they had been dropped into this battle right after a long day of trekking to this location. On top of that, Leonel probably didn't know due to his lack of experience that stamina ran out faster on the battlefield.\nAll the adrenalin and nerves made one exceptionally tight, making them use more strength than they needed to. Battles of this level usually lasted at least a few hours, how could Leonel possibly last to the end.\nLionus narrowed his eyes at these words. Everyone thought Leonel was being hot headed, even Lionus believed so. But… for some reason Lionus felt that Leonel just might give them a surprise…\nLionus' gaze shifted to another part of the battlefield. He watched as a man with two long swords tore a path on a war horse. His killing speed was even several levels beyond Leonel. Though, his opponents were a few levels weaker as well since they were the fodder of the front line.\n'For Leonel to appear now of all times… Is this a good or a bad thing…?'\nLionus' thoughts didn't seem to have a thread that connected them. Thinking this while looking toward the man with snake eyes. Just what did it mean?\nHowever, even if Leonel knew of this, it was unlikely that he would care at this point. All he wanted was to battle, to satiate the raging, boiling blood in his veins.\n\"Pirnce, 17 Demon Generals have surrounded Leonel!\" Elys practically shrieked.\nShe had been nearly fanatical about Leonel ever since she found out his true status. Even after it came out that Leonel was actually a Earth Childe, Elys realized that there were political machinations behind this. After all, she had been there that day.\nSo, all this time she had been focused on Leonel despite the fact she was meant to be acting as a scout for Lionus. When she saw such a thing, she couldn't help but pale. However, she had no idea that this was exactly what Leonel was waiting for.\n'[Demon General]. Elite 7 Star to 8 star threats. It will be several times more efficient to defeat many of them at once.'\nThe green flame Demon General was already enraged to the point of his chest bursting. When he saw so many converging toward Leonel, he felt that it was finally time for his revenge. None of the Demon Lords had good feelings toward one another. This was even more so for Demon Generals.\nThat said, just because the green flame Demon General didn't like them, didn't mean he wasn't willing to use them to kill Leonel.\nHowever, this would be the second time Leonel's gaze met the green flames of the Demon General. And once again, a cold shiver snaked up the latter's spine.\nLeonel didn't smirk, he didn't sneer, there wasn't even a light of satisfaction in his eyes. Yet, the Demon Generals still felt as though he was looking toward them from on high. They were nothing but stepping stones he could use to vent the discomfort in his heart.\n\"[Grand Marshlands].\"\nLeonel spoke calmly, but the surge of wind the wrapped around his body when these words fell made it feel as though a cyclone was forming in the middle of the battlefield.",

      "content": "The Demon Generals immediately realized that something was wrong. But, by then, it was already too late. Aside from one that had bat-like wings, allowing her to soar into the skies and escape, the remaining 16 found themselves trapped.\nThe cracked, grey lands of the battlefield suddenly became a land of soft, muddy earth. Their bodies sunk down to their ankles, slowing their movement speeds by several levels. Yet, Leonel remained completely unaffected.\nThe immediate reaction of the Demon Generals was to use Force to tread on the marshland just like they would on water. It was a seemingly easy solution that was right before them. As battle hardened veterans, they had of course put their lives on the line countless times before. How could they not react quickly to such a dangerous situation?\nHowever, dreams were great while reality was cruel. This might have looked like a normal marshland, but if it was truly so easy to escape… how could it be worthy of being a One Star Magus Art?\n\"Shit! I can't escape!\"\n.\nA large man with fur covered skin and two large canine teeth that hung out from his mouth snarled. His square face distorted in fury. It was clear that he wasn't very intelligent, because seeing that he was having trouble gathering Force to the soles of his feet, his solution was to forcefully use more.\nThe more intelligent of the Demon Generals paled in despair. They realized now what was happening. This [Grand Marshlands] had a secondary function of acting like a sponge to Force. No matter how hard they tried to gather Force, it would be useless. In fact, if they acted like the square-faced fool, they would only deplete their reserves quicker.\nBy this point, the Demon Generals were feeling incomparably aggrieved. Such a large crowd control spell should have taken a normal Earth Mage at least ten seconds to cast even if they were very efficient in using it. However, not only did Leonel take less than three, but the range was almost 50 meters, easily double what a normal mage should have been able to accomplish.\nLeonel didn't even spare these Demon Generals a glance. He looked up into the skies toward the female demon with bat wings. His left palm flipped over, revealing a long barreled pistol with a harpoon fitted to it.\nBANG!\nThe bat-winged Demon General tried to swerve in the air, but the result was her wing being torn apart. She could only watch on in horror as she crashed into the marshlands below. She regretted not flying away at the first instant she could, but there was no medicine for such a feeling.\nLeonel shot forward, appearing before the raging square-faced Demon General.\n\"Boy, I'll smash you to a pulp!\"\nThe Demon General raised his club above his head, already picturing the scene of Leonel being smashed into a blood mist.\nHowever, the instant he did, he realized that he was suddenly feeling light headed. Why did he feel so weak all of a sudden?\nIn a second of distraction, a sharp pain ripped through his throat. He looked down in disbelief to find Leonel spear being pulled out of his body. Even as the life faded from within him, he didn't realize that he only felt so weak due to his own stupidity.\nLeonel appeared before the bat-winged Demon General in a flash, not stopping to admire his kill for even a moment. The latter was still sprawled on the damp ground. Though it had dulled the impact for her, it was also the reason she was even more stuck than the others were.\nShe didn't even have the time to lift her head from the ground before Leonel's spear ran through her back, piercing her heart.\nLeonel flickered around the battlefield. Whether it was the Demon Generals or their subordinates that happened to get caught in the range of his spear, he showed no mercy.\n\"RUN!\"\nThe Demon Generals couldn't bother to stay any longer. The man was nothing more than a god of death. It felt like he was looking at them as though they were just numbers on a sheet, a tally to his success and nothing more.\nUnfortunately, was it really so easy to run from Leonel? Every Earth Spell Leonel cast carried a variance to it due to his mutated Spirit Pressure affinity. This variance was related to his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor. It naturally ingrained metals into all of his Mage Arts.\nThis ability wasn't very useful for an ability like [Grand Marshlands] or [Mud Pit]. However… When it came to defense and attacking Earth Mage Arts, Leonel's could be said to be double the strength of a normal cast without any exaggeration.\nThere was another spell that got a boost as well. And that was…\n\"[Harden].\"\nThe expanse of marshlands suddenly became solid land once again. A wild surge of winds whipped around Leonel. To use [Harden] on such a large scale was completely different than using it like he had previously on [Mud Pit]. However, to Leonel, he didn't feel that there was much of a difference at all.\nBy now, in their struggle, the Demon Generals and other Demons had already sunk down to the shins. And now… they suddenly found themselves completely trapped.\nIt was a one sided slaughter. Leonel shot through the 50 meter radius like a fluttering leaf dripping with blood. Every place he stopped would suddenly bloom a flower of crimson, reaping the life of another demon.\nThe green flame Demon General watched on with horror. He couldn't move even a single inch. Even now, he had no idea who Leonel was. He had thought that their Demon Army had information on all the great talents of Camelot. So… where the hell had this boy come from?\nHe treated their lives like weeds. The green flame Dmeon General had already lost count of all the atrocities he had committed. But, somehow before Leonel, he felt like an innocent child who didn't understand the world.\nA bitter chuckle left the Demon General's lips as Leonel's spear finally found its way to him. It wasn't long before the green flames of his eyes waned and flickered out. The last sight he saw were Leonel's expressionless violet eyes. He seemed… disappointed?\nLeonel ripped his spear from the Demon General's skull.\nHe looked down at the once beautiful spear, realizing that it was beaten and battered now. There were multiple chips on its common iron head and its wooden body was chipped in several places.\nUltimately, it was just a common weapon. It couldn't even be considered a Tier 1 Black Grade treasure. It found it hard to resist Leonel's own strength, let alone those of his enemy. If it wasn't for Spear Domain's recovery feature and the protective shield provided by Leonel's Spear Force, it would have already broken down long ago.\nLeonel looked up. He noticed the look of fear the demons around him had. No, that was a bit inaccurate… They weren't around him because the entire 50 meter radius of him had been completely emptied out!\nLeonel stood there, a halo of violet bronze above his head and a crown etched onto his forehead. His bronze hair billowed in the wind, his piercing violet-red eyes seemingly tearing through the void. He was covered in blood of all colors from head to toe…\nIt was hard to tell who the true demon was.",

      "content": "A shocked hush came over the battlefield.\nIt wasn't that it was truly quiet. The clash of weapons, the cry of men, the stomping of hooves — they were all still there. However, there was a hard to describe stillness to the atmosphere.\nLeonel was deep within enemy territory, standing all alone. It should have been a dangerous situation. He should have been scratching and clawing just to keep his own life. Yet, the truth was that he stood all alone, the surrounding space around him littered with corpses.\nA deep breath sunk into Leonel's lungs. He felt his Force Nodes throbbing, recovering his stamina at unimaginable speeds. His stamina was already frightening after activating his Nodes, he could only imagine what level it would reach once he formed his ninth and tenth.\n.\nBANG!\nThe ground Leonel stood on heavily shook. He looked up calmly from his thoughts to find the massive Minotaur Demon Lord standing before him, his bloodied ax leaving a massive fissure in the ground.\nIn the distance, Lancelot frowned. He was still a distance from Leonel, there was nothing he could do about this.\nFor one, Leonel had rushed forward first. Secondly, Lancelot couldn't be as free spirited as Leonel, he had an army to lead. If he broke free and charged forward alone, it wouldn't have been impossible to already catch up with Leonel. However, as things stood now, it was impossible for him to abandon his men for one Leonel.\nAt the same time, he was still greatly worried. Leonel was a great talent, it would be a massive blow to Camelot if he were to fall here.\nThough Leonel had been chopping down Demon Generals like weeds, it had to be said that Demon Lords had an average strength just marginally below that of the Knights of the Round table and the Magi of Camelot.\nThis was just their average strength. The top echelon of them didn't lose out to the best Camelot had to offer by much at all. In fact, aside from King Arthur, the top three Knights of the Round Table and Pope Margrave, they were stronger than anything Camelot had to offer.\nLancelot knew the three Demon Lords that had come this time. Though their abilities weren't so exaggerated, they weren't the worst of the Demon Lords either. They could be ranked within the middle echelons of the Demon Army. That was enough to be as strong as some of the weaker Magi and Knights of the Round Table.\nThe minotaur that just landed before Leonel was Demon Lord Gorgo. He was ranked 26th amongst the Demon Lords and had astounding power. How could Lancelot not be worried.\n\"Little baby boy, I've never met someone as eager to die as you.\"\nLeonel didn't respond. It wasn't that he didn't want to, but rather that he couldn't hear Gorgo's words at all.\nThe beating of his heart was growing wilder. His blood rushed through his veins like rushing tides. He felt as though a? waterfall was crashing through his body, one capable of shattering rocks and drowning whales. It was to the point that even the Demon Lord before him could faintly hear it.\nLeonel brandished his spear. As though he didn't know fear, he looked up at the minotaur that stood almost a full meter taller than him, his piercing violet-red eyes tearing through his veil of superiority with indifference.\n\"Hehe…\" Gorgo laughed, his mouth spreading open to reveal two neat rows of pearly white teeth. They were so clear that Leonel could have even seen his own reflection should he have wanted to. However, this laughter wasn't jovial in the slightest.\n\"… I don't like that look in your eyes, little baby boy. Why don't I gouge them out for you?\"\nGorgo slowly raised his ax, his aura imposing and looming. Even compared to Leonel's own, it didn't seem to lose out in the slightest. But, after a moment, it became clear why.\nGorgo's aura was an aggregation of killing intent. Leonel's own was nothing but an intense will toward competition. While it seemed Gorgo's matched Leonel's, this was only because of its sinister attribute. It made it more memorable. This was compared to Leonel's which was a rich, steady stream.\nIt was like comparing two dishes. One might have a potent smell to it, but it wouldn't necessarily taste better…\nHowever, the minotaur didn't seem to realize any of this. In his mind, this was only right. How could his own aura lose out to this baby boy? He was a mighty Demon Lord. Ants like Leonel were destined to fall beneath his blade,\nAt that moment, the battle ax reached its apex.\nLeonel's eyes narrowed, sweeping one of his feet backward to sink into a steady stance.\nSHUU!\nThe bloodied ax descended. It tore about the wind and left a whistling streak of air in its wake, seeking to tear Leonel in half.\nLeonel felt his heart thump. Countless calculations streamed through his mind. In the end, he found that dodging this strike was actually impossible.\nThe strike seemed simple, but it actually cut off all paths of retreat. It felt like the blade was a void, sucking everything toward it without regard. It took Leonel only a moment to realize that this must be a special ability of the minotaur.\nThere shouldn't be abilities in this world, but that didn't mean that there weren't creatures born with special characteristics. Or, in this case… Demon Lords who practiced special Force techniques.\nWithout a choice, Leonel poured everything he had into his spear.\n\"[Reinforce]. [Harden]. [Earthen Armor].\"\nA violent wind surged around Leonel, quickly coalescing into scales of earth that formed a metallic sheen of armor around his arm and spear.\nLeonel's back and arm flexed, his bronze Runes pulsing with life.\nHe stabbed upward, meeting the descending ax without the slightest hint of fear.\nLancelot's eyes widened. He had actually feared that Leonel wouldn't retreat. That would fall right into Gorgo's hands. But, meeting him head on was also not the greatest option either. Gorgo was simply too strong.\nBANG!\nLeonel's spear bent like a bow, his knees bending under the strain of the strike.\nBANG!\nThe battle ax continued, but Leonel had taken advantage of the small delay to step outside its range, barely dodging the blade.\nSNAP!\nLeonel's spear couldn't withstand the strain. Even after being protected by Leonel's magic, it snapped in two, one of its halves rebounding into the air and spinning wildly.\nGorgo took several steps back. It might very well have been more had his ax not sliced against the ground, slowing his momentum.\nAs though in shock, Gorgo looked toward his ax then back toward Leonel, his gaze growing serious.\nThe second half of Leonel's spear fell to the ground, not even having enough strength to pierce the earth.\nLeonel could only sigh. This spear was truly too weak. And, he hadn't quite learned how to integrate his Metal Synergy with his Spear Force just yet…\n\"Little baby boy… It seems you have some skill. But… What are you going to do without your weapon?\"\nGorgo's sneer deepened as he slowly walked forward, regaining his calm.\nLeonel remained calm. It was as though he hadn't heard Gorgo's words at all. The rushing of his blood was only growing. That single strike… It wasn't enough…\nLeonel put the half that remained of his spear away, calmly tracing the band of his spatial bracelet in a somewhat absentminded manner.\nThen, as though a magician, he pinched with two fingers, slowly pulling as a new spear manifested itself.\nThe clang of rattling chains grated against the ear as a long, black polearm was pulled from Leonel's spatial bracelet. Though it was just an illusion of the mind, it felt as though it was endlessly long, as though there would never come a point where its pole stopped.\nHowever, soon, Leonel had pulled it out completely.\nThe chains around its black body continued to rattle. Even with its butt remaining planted on the ground, it stood more than a head taller than Leonel, its flat, shimmering blade being almost two feet long alone.\nLeonel swept the spear forward, causing the banging of the chains to become even more grating. Even without touching the ground, its sharpness left an arc on the cracked land before Leonel as though marking his territory.\nHe looked up and met Gorgo's eyes. His gaze seemed to say all that needed to be said.\nCome!",

      "content": "Spear Domain.\nIt was a treasure the likes of which only three others existed. It was a land of spears and spearmen that ruled over eras and generations. This was Spear Domain.\nAfter awakening his Wisdom Branch, Leonel's spirit skyrocketed. So, it was no surprise that the distance he could walk within Spear Domain had also, likewise, increased by a large measure.\nThe hidden world of Spear Domain was separated into several peaks. In the beginning, Leonel thought that these were simply separations of weak to strong. But, the truth wasn't so simple.\nTo understand Spear Domain, one must understand the Spear Domain Lineage Factor. This bloodline allows one to pour all of one's skill into a single spear.. No matter what abilities you have or gain, it becomes possible to perfectly integrate it into one's Spear Force.\nThis accumulative Spear Force becomes layered and slowly grows more and more powerful over time. Eventually, if one walks to the end of Spear Domain and reaches the highest peak, forming a spear that encompasses all, it would be possible to stand atop the universe!\nTherein lies the truth behind these peaks of Spear Domain…\nEvery previous owner of Spear Domain would form a peak. The penultimate weapon of their lifetimes would be pierced into this peak while all the spears surrounding the base of it represented all the styles and techniques they integrated into their own!\nThe black spear in Leonel's hands now, the very one with dangling black chains clattering amidst a silent battlefield, was the spear of the first peak. The primitive woman and primitive man were both spears that could only surround the base of its peak!\nGorgo felt his heart palpitate when his gaze landed on Leonel's spear. It felt like he was staring at the sovereign of an era, an impossibly tall mountain crashing down toward him.\nIt was just the first peak of the smallest hill. In fact, Leonel counted that there were hundreds of hills within Spear Domain that shared the same height as the hill he pulled this spear from, and those were just the one's in his line of vision. Yet, even it was able to make Gorgo's knees go weak.\n'This weapon…'\nIn the distance, the zombie Demon Lord locked eyes on Leonel's spear, his heart involuntarily palpitating. Greed lit his rotting eyes.\nEven with his status, he had never seen such a powerful weapon. In fact, he doubted that even Lord Modred's weapon could match the one in Leonel's hand right now.\nThe black spear was a Quasi Bronze treasure just half a step away from becoming a true Bronze treasure. It was no wonder others were reacting like this, but Leonel wasn't thinking about such things at all. He was entirely focused on the task at hand.\nThe spear in his hand weighed just over a hundred pounds. The amount of focus he needed to control it was far more than any other weapon he had ever wielded before. However, at the same time, it made his blood boil endlessly.\nHis mind flashed with the vision he saw when he touched this spear. Unlike the other two spears he had touched, he didn't get sent to witness a life moment of the owner. Instead, he found himself in a world of darkness, a perpetual pressure weighing down on him from all sides.\nLeonel knew that he hadn't grasped even a single percent of what that world of darkness wanted to portray to him. He also knew that it was his fault for this as well. After all, he skipped over all of the spears that were meant to form the foundation to truly understand the weapon in his hands. The smart thing to do would be to slowly build up his understanding by comprehending all the spears around the base of this spear's peak.\nHowever… the current Leonel just couldn't wait. He could always go back to thoroughly understand those spears. But this battle… he wanted to fight it now!\nLeonel shot forward, the piercing strikes of his spear casting a net of black toward Gorgo. The chains on its body danced, lashing out like whips and poisonous snakes.\nGorgo felt a palpable pressure descend onto him. He struck out on reflex, hoping to send Leonel back, but the result left him horrified.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nAx and spear met time and time again. With each strike, Gorgo felt his arms go numb. It was as though a hammer was smashing into his body continuously. His organs shook, his bones quaked, even the blood vessels in his eyes popped.\nHe was losing… in strength?\nThe only thing that kept him going was the idea that Leonel should be worse off. After all, he was a human. How could his body compare to a mighty Demon Minotaur's?\nUnfortunately… reality was cruel.\nIn the past several weeks, Leonel's body had already reached the standard of a Weak Third Dimension metal. With his Runes activated, trying to harm him was just like trying to cut apart an unrefined ore.\nThe first stage of refining his Metal Body was separated by the Dimensions. Within the Third Dimension, the tiers were separated into Weak, Standard, Strong, Superior and Perfect. Only by opening the eighth door would one be able to reach the Superior standing and only those that opened the ninth would be able to reach Perfection. However, even the weakest Weak standing was enough to drive an opponent mad.\nWhile Gorgo's body felt as though it might break down at any moment, Leonel only felt slightly numb. Only the weakest parts of his body like his wrists and ankles felt any real discomfort.\nIn Leonel's current state… wielding a heavy weapon like his black spear couldn't have felt any better!\nGorgo shrunk back, completely deactivating his void Force. Usually, others would try to run from him, so his suction technique was a death sentence to all. Yet, now, it was nothing but a detriment to himself.\nHis heart sank when he saw the chips and cracking of the ax in his hand. Was the difference between their weapons really so great? He felt that in just a few more strikes, the companion that had followed him for so many decades would meet its end right here.\n'Dammit!' Gorgo shouted in his mind.\nHow had he been so unlucky to come across such an abnormal little baby boy?! Even the weapon he wielded was heavier than his own!\nSuddenly, Leonel's spear tip shook, a faint light coating its surface.\nGorgo's expression changed. Reacting quickly, he used his ax to protect his chest.\nPCHU! CRACK!\nA pain trembled Gorgo's heart. He watched as Leonel's spear embedded itself into his ax. Though it didn't pass all the way through, such a crack meant the end of a weapon.\nGorgo explosively retreated beneath the shocked gazes of the armies around.\nOthers may not know it, but after today they surely would. The reason Leonel lost so badly to Lamorak wasn't just because of his crystallized Force, but also because his weapon couldn't hold a candle to the Grand Knight's.\nThough Leonel would have still lost had he had this spear back then, it wouldn't have been so quickly. And, now that he had begun to crystallize his own Force and had such a weapon in hand… He had no intention of losing to the Demon Lord before him!\n\"BOY! I'll go all out with you!\"\nA dense black Force erupted around Gorgo. It felt as though his body had become the center of a black hole, causing everything to surge toward him.\nWind whipped around wildly. If it wasn't for the fact Leonel was holding such a heavy spear, he might have been sent flying toward the minotaur Demon Lord as well.\nLeonel's eyes shone. 'This must be a knight technique of this world…'",

      "content": "Leonel was just one person. With his ability, he was able to split his mind and study many things at once, but even then, he only had one body. There were only so many things he could do at once.\nIn truth, he was already lucky to have set aside some time to gain the acknowledgement of the spear in his hand currently. He still remembered the feeling of his soul sheering apart beneath its presence…\nHowever, no matter how much of an advantage his ability gave him, he couldn't master everything. To now, he had mastered all the abilities the Mage Academy had to offer him in terms of Mage Arts. But, he still hadn't had time to study the path of knights.\nSeeing Gorgo explode like this before him, it reaffirmed his will to dig up all the secrets of this world.\nWhat remained of Leonel's robes billowed beneath the wind. He could already feel his arms slightly aching beneath the pressure. This wasn't due to Gorgo's strikes, but rather because he wasn't used to using such a heavy weapon..\nTo the current Leonel, lifting a hundred pounds wasn't a problem. In fact, this was simple even for an average male. However, lifting a weight and using a weapon of such heft were two completely different concepts.\nBANG!\nGorgo's armor cracked and shattered into several pieces, spiraling into every which direction like the shrapnel of a grenade. His bulging muscles flexed beneath the influx of energy surging toward him, veins of pumping blood racing across his skin like crimson serpents.\nHe raised his ax into the air. But, his target wasn't Leonel at all. Instead, he slammed the flat of the blade over his knee, shattering the blade along the line of the damage Leonel had caused.\nThe resulting weapon was sinister beyond belief. The irregular, jagged edge looked like the jaws of a demon bearing down from above.\nSHUUU!\nThe ax left trails of sliced wind in its path as it descended. Its irregular edge caused the air to bend and twist, making it sound as though a ghastly flute was being blown.\nLeonel's gaze burned with fighting intent. His Spear Force coated the two foot long flat blade of his spear as he pierced forward without regard.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nThe blood in Leonel's body rolled with every collision.\nIt was clear to anyone observing that Leonel had greater strength and that even his movement was a measure better. However… His technique was simply too lacking.\nEvery strike of Gorgo seemed to contain a mysterious air to it. His strikes uniquely flowed from one stance to another, achieving a smooth resonance that allowed him to lose himself in battle.\nHowever, Leonel's movements lacked variation. He continuously calculated and responded with a strong pierce again and again, but this was all. He could only rely on his ability to make up for his lack of skill, but against a truly strong enemy, such a thing would be useless.\nLike this, Gorgo and Leonel fell into a stalemate, neither one gaining an advantage over the other. And, with Gorgo's weapon having been broken once before, breaking it again after it shrunk in size was several levels more difficult.\nIn the distance, Lancelot was beginning to grow worried, even more so than he had been before.\n'This boy… Doesn't he know that a spear can do more than pierce?!'\nHow could Lancelot know that all of Leonel's skill came from the primitive man and woman? The primitive man only taught him how to bring out the full potential of his body with every strike, but the primitive woman's fighting technique was entirely reliant on a piercing motion.\nThe primitive woman's spear had a modified blade in the shape of a prism. This made its piercing power incredibly strong, almost like the stinger of a bee, but as a result, it lost its ability to perform the other kinds of strikes.\nDue to his inexperience, Leonel took a battle that he most assuredly should have won and turned it into a struggle. Even still, Leonel didn't take a single step back. In fact, his indifferent expression began to crack, shimmering with hints of happiness.\nHis eyes grew more focused. Ignoring the aching of his arms, he pierced forward again and again as though he didn't know fatigue.\nJust when Leonel was about to lose himself in battle, he frowned. An instinct that came from the depths of his heart suddenly trembled.\nLeonel didn't need to look to know what happened. His Internal Sight was too sharp. He felt the eyes of the two Demon Lords locked onto him.\nThe sudden feeling was almost as though his head had been dunked into a vat of ice and water. He had almost forgotten that he was on a battlefield. Venting his frustration was fine, but burning himself out to the point of running on empty would be like asking for death.\n'My spearmanship is too lacking. I need to absorb the experiences of more of the spears surrounding the base of this peak spear…'\nLeonel took a deep breath. With his fatigue growing, his rolling blood was also losing its control over him, even the violet-red of his eyes began to slowly fade.\nOthers could sense this. In fact, the sharpness of the two remaining Demon Lords grew. The only Demon Lord that wasn't inwardly celebrating was Gorgo. How could he? His state was even sorrier than Leonel's.\nHowever, Leonel wasn't worried… His body might have reached its limit but… His Ethereal Glabella was still filled to the brim with Soul Force.\n'I should end this.'\n\"[Grand Gravity Warp]. [Layering Arts].\"\nDemon Lord Gorgo was caught completely off guard. He had completely forgotten that Leonel was a mage. Or, maybe he hadn't forgotten, but maybe had assumed that Leonel's magic fell far short of his spearmanship. However, reality was cruel.\nReaching the end of his stamina, Gorgo's legs trembled and he heavily fell to his knees. His ax failed to block Leonel's following spear strike, causing his collarbone to be run through completely.\nLeonel's Spear Force was so sharp that an invisible blade ran through the minotaur's body, exiting his shoulder blade and running through the ground behind his kneeling figure.\nThe zombie and skeleton Demon Lord were stunned by this sudden change of events. They had just been waiting for an opportune time to strike, how had the situation reversed so suddenly?\nAt that moment, having used Leonel's forward momentum to their benefit, Camelot's army had already cut down a large portion of the demon army. Before, it would have been worth it to take advantage of Leonel's situation. But, if Leonel still had so much strength left to fight, it was simply impossible to try and benefit now.\nWith a placid expression, the zombie Demon Lord signaled with his hand, causing loud, blaring horns to sound. Like a tide, the demons began to retreat, not sparing a glance toward Gorgo who had yet to breathe his last breath.",

      "content": "\"Hehe… A little baby boy actually dares to hold back while fighting me.\"\nGorgo coughed up several mouthfuls of blood, his once pearly white teeth becoming covered in a sheen of crimson.\nLeonel's gaze met the minotaur Demon Lord's. Although Gorgo was on his knees now, he was so tall to begin with that Leonel could only look him in the eye.\nIt wasn't that Leonel was looking down on Gorgo, it was rather that Leonel himself was too strong. Because of this, his actual fighting prowess had stagnated.\nDuring his studies in the Mage Academy, Leonel had learned a lot. His Dreamscape was filled to the brim with mage textbooks and manuals of all kinds. But, if he were to separate them into groups and point out which had the largest percentage of theories written about it, there was no doubt in his mind that it would be 'battle sense'.\nTo a mage, there were things more important than how many spells you knew and how powerful your spells were.. What stood above that was timing, situation and execution.\nEvery Mage Art took time to cast. When a Mage Art was ultimately cast, it would impact the environment and change the situation around the next Mage Art. And, every Mage Art took a good portion of one's Spirit Pressure to cast.\nUltimately, between knights and mages, mages were particularly worried about battle sense and efficiency. If one had poor battle sense, it was very possible for a weaker mage to defeat a stronger one.\nHow a mage economized their Spirit Pressure, how they prepared spells in battle -- building up with shorts casts to longer ones -- and even down to the angles to which they pointed their wands were all important aspects of battle sense.\nThis realization ingrained one thing in Leonel's mind: He was still too weak.\nBefore, he hadn't realized how much of a grip this thought had on his heart until he realized just how much his loss to Lamorak had affected him. But now, he couldn't have been more clear.\nTo the current Leonel, defeating Gorgo by relying on his combination mage and spearman abilities held no meaning. The only reason he resorted to it in those final moments was because he felt that if he continued, his life would be in jeopardy.\nThis was maybe the first time in his life that Leonel was truly faced with his own weakness. He couldn't help but have thoughts of what would happen to him if he was less talented. Such a thing left him feeling greatly uncomfortable in his heart. It was an emotion he didn't quite understand how to reconcile with.\nLeonel's spear pulled out from Gorgo's collarbone and struck down again. This time, he pierced his heart.\nAs Gorgo's life faded, so too did Leonel's blazing aura. His Runes dimmed and sunk into his skin and his violet-red eyes slowly faded to its usual pale green.\nA wave of fatigue overwhelmed Leonel. His breathing couldn't help but grow heavy.\nHe was only barely able to counter the side effects of his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor after reaching the Weak state. But, his body still felt heavy. Of course, it also didn't help that his new weapon was over a hundred pounds either.\n'My Force and Soul Force are still at over 70% capacity, yet my body can't keep up…' Leonel frowned.\nHe felt like a headless chicken. He was always coming up with issues he could work on, but he never had a perfect solution for any of them. He needed more knowledge.\nThe Mage Academy had a limited amount of information on matters related to the body, but the Knight Academy should be different…\nLeonel turned around to hear the stomping hooves of a band of horses. The first sight he saw was Lancelot's stern face, carrying a lance bloodied by battle.\nLeonel smiled somewhat bitterly. He didn't have much experience in battle, but it was pretty much common knowledge that rules and regulations were extremely important on the battlefield. He had acted without regard for consequences earlier, but that didn't mean that there wouldn't be any.\nHowever, Leonel wasn't stupid either. Mages were a special circumstance. Usually, the more powerful a mage, the less restricted they were by the rules of the army. For example, Lionus, as a Light Mage, traveled around the battlefield to where he was needed. So, Leonel wasn't too worried about punishment.\nIt was just that he fought too much like a knight, so it was easy for those watching to forget he was a mage.\nLancelot saw Leonel's calm expression and his lip couldn't help but twitch. This boy, couldn't he at least pretend to be afraid?\nThough Lancelot thought this and even tried to think of ways to make Leonel suffer a small loss, he soon remembered that he actually didn't have any power to punish Leonel. This feeling left him quite stifled.\nIn truth, he was thankful to Leonel. Though he was confident that they would have won the battle anyway, it most definitely wouldn't have been so easy.\nDemons were different from humans. Their population of warriors was far higher despite the fact the overall population of humans outstripped them. As a result, they were uncaring about casualties and usually attacked in waves, whittling down their stamina for weeks and months on end.\nDue to this, the Demons had an overall losing record against humans, but in the grand scheme, it was actually humans who were on the losing end. Something like winning with so few casualties, and even taking down a Demon Lord at the same time, was of great benefit to Camelot.\nJust as Lancelot was thinking of how to deal with Leonel without appearing too weak and forgiving, a scout suddenly rushed to the front line.\n\"Sir Lancelot! Urgent tidings!\"\n\"Hm?\"\nLancelot frowned. They just finished a several hour long battle, what could it possibly be now?\n\"Speak.\" Lancelot finally said.\n\"This…\"\nThe messenger looked toward Leonel and hesitated. The other knights around Lancelot were his respected guards. No commander would enter a battlefield alone, they would always have death guards around them. The first priority of these death guards was to ensure the safety of the commander.\nThis was all to say that while it was alright for such trusted subordinates to hear this message, Leonel was an unknown factor. The scout's hesitancy just went to show how important the message was.\n\"It's alright, speak.\"\nThe scout took a deep breath. \"I come from the #15 Small Barrack just northwest of here. We've been overrun by demons and are seeking assistance.\"\nLancelot frowned.\n\"Sir Lancelot, Sir Lancelot!\"\nThe information from the first scout hadn't even settled in before another messenger suddenly crossed onto the battlefield.\nA bad premonition suddenly struck the Knight of the Round Table.",

      "content": "In the Border Region, the forts were separated into Small and Large Barracks. There were a total of 99 Small Barracks and 9 Large Barracks. All Small Barracks were headed by Three Star Grand Knights while all Large Barracks were headed by Knights of the Round Table in shifts.\nWith this sort of setup, it was obvious that every Large Barrack had 11 Small Barracks under their charge. However, what Lancelot could have never expected was for six of his Small Barracks to suddenly come out and ask for help like this.\nLancelot frowned.\nHe had thought that the Demons retreated a bit too easily. Though Leonel was putting a lot of pressure on them, it was also obvious that Leonel had been reaching the end of his rope. On top of that, they allowed one of the Demon Lords to die too easily… Unless!\nLancelot's heart trembled.\nOthers might not know why the Demon Lords were insistent on keeping their numbers at 66, but Lancelot was very much aware.. Lionus had explained it to Leonel perfunctorily, but how could such a thing not have a deep, underlying reason for it?\nThe truth was that just like paladins of Pope Margrave, much of the strength of the Demon Lords were gained directly from Modred. The balance of this shared power was perfect when there were 66 of them. However, when there was an additional Demon Lord, that balance would be lost.\nThis wasn't as simple as there not being enough Darkness Internal Strength. Modred's power was beyond imagining. If The Pope could have hundreds of Paladins, it obviously wasn't a problem for Modred to have hundreds of Demon Lords. The issue lied in the properties of Dark Internal Strength. Or rather, in the propertied of Modred's Dark Internal Strength.\nThis kind of Internal Strength was exceptionally volatile and difficult to control. In addition, it had a negative influence on one's Ethereal Glabella, and by extension, one's Soul Force. As a result, whenever there was an imbalance in Demon Lords, their strength took a dive as a collective.\nThat was right. Demon Lord Gorgo was about 10% weaker than his peak form when he was fighting Leonel for this very reason.\nOne might ask then, why would Lancelot allow Leonel to kill Gorgo, then? Wouldn't it benefit Camelot if this imbalance continued? Well the answer to that was obvious.\nWhat use would there be if Camelot went out of their way to not kill Demon Lords just to keep this imbalance? It might have been possible to capture and imprison Gorgo today, but would it always be so simple? Demon Lords weren't stupid… And, things also weren't so straightforward either.\nFor one, Mordred could dispell the powers of a Demon Lord whenever she so wished. Even if Gorgo was captured, if the Demon Army came to be at a disadvantage, Modred could easily snatch Gorgo's strength from a distance.\nSecondly, even if Camelot went out of their way to capture and not kill Demon Lords… these were Demons they were talking about! Why wouldn't they just kill amongst themselves until their numbers were balanced once again?\nBefore, Lionus had silently thought that this all out attack and this chaos was exactly what Modred wanted, and he was likely correct. Even if Modred protected the newly appointed Demon Lord, if the Demon Lords were so eager for balance, couldn't they just kill one another?\nYet, instead of simply picking a new target, the Demons chose to launch an all out offensive against Camelot.\nIf Lancelot's thoughts were correct, then it was very likely that his Large Barracks weren't the only ones to receive so many SOS calls at once. It may be that the entire Border Region was lit with flames of war!\nWhen his trail of thoughts reached this point, Lancelot sucked in a cold breath. Was Modred really prepared to act again after so many years?\n'Last time she acted…'\nA hint of pain flashed by through Lancelot's gaze. It wasn't a pain of the flesh, but rather one of the heart. It seemed that whatever memories he was thinking of deeply scarred him.\nLeonel didn't know about any of this insider information. He only watched silently as Lancelot's expression changed several times. He thought himself to be good at reading human emotion, but whatever Lancelot was thinking of was way beyond his means to comprehend.\nAfter a while, Lancelot took in a deep breath.\n\"Aleck, Peirce, Bran, Amaud, Jeffroy, Hammond — You'll lead your troops to support the Small Barracks.\"\nLeonel's eyes couldn't help but flicker toward Peirce. He was the very same man who had two exceptionally long swords strapped to the sides of his horse. Leonel had paid a small bit of attention toward him during the battle. His skill could only be described as frightening.\nOriginally, Leonel had thought him to be one of the Knights of the Round Table as well. But, by his name, it was obvious that he wasn't.\n'Who is he, exactly?'\nLeonel had no idea.\nLancelot continued to give out orders.\n\"… You scouts will second messages back to the remaining Small Barracks. Have them all retreat back here. I have a feeling that things won't end so simply.\n\"Also, someone call our Beast Mage here, have him send out several hawks to the other Large Barracks. Inform them of my decision.\"\nA Beast Mage, from Leonel's readings, was a mage without affinity. They were essentially a Mental Mage, just like Elys, except they focused on mental manipulation magic that worked on low intelligence creatures.\nThere strength wasn't very great, so they were often restricted to roles much like the order Lancelot just gave out.\n\"… As for the rest of you, rest and prepare for battle. The two remaining enemies we face are Demon Lord Dagon and Coyote. Dagon is famous for his night raids, this isn't the time to let our guards down.\"\nA heavy expression colored Lancelot's features.\nDemon Lord Dagon was the skeleton demon with prisoner steel balls strapped to his wrists and ankles. While Gorgo had been ranked in the low 20's, he had broken into the top 20.\nHowever, Demon Lord Coyote was even more mysterious. While Lancelot had some information about Dagon's tendencies, he knew next to nothing about Coyote, the zombie Demon Lord. Whether it was his strength or personality, they were all just mere guesses.\nLancelot had a feeling that the reason they retreated so easily was to divert his attention to the Small Barracks. Now that half of their forces had to leave, their situation during the next battle could be imagined.\nLeonel calmly watched this from start to finish, his mind as placid as a calm lake.",

      "content": "Leonel entered the Abode Setting of the Segmented Cube. Without much thought, he made his way to the bath house and dove into a serene pool of water.\nThe soothing waters felt so good that a moan almost escape his lips.\nLeonel floated in the waters, looking up at the beautifully crafted ceilings of the bath house. Whoever it was who constructed this treasure was a true genius. Leonel could hardly make crafts with five or so parts, he couldn't imagine the number needed to make a treasure of this level.\nIn truth, Leonel was quite used to the aches of his body. He was a student athlete, after all. Compared to others, he was far more ready for this new world order. He had always been in tiptop shape.\nBut… being a good sprinter didn't mean you were a good long distance runner, and being a good long distance runner didn't mean you could run the 400 meter race..\nThere were different aspects to being an athlete and not all forms of endurance were the same. Leonel thought himself to be a great athlete, but a single battle had completely shredded his body.\nThe good news was that Leonel felt that just an hour or two would be enough to recover thanks to this pool. The bad news was that he wouldn't always have time to recover.\nLeonel activated the Nodes in the walls of his heart. His heartbeat quickened, causing the run of blood throughout his body to accelerate, thus speeding up his recovery process.\nThe blood was exceptionally important to recovery. Whenever one was injured, it would be the first responder in every case. This was the reason why bruises swelled and torn muscles reddened. After opening his Seventh and Eighth Nodes, Leonel gained access to this ability.\n'It should be safe in here…' Leonel thought to himself.\n\"[Minor Heal]…\"\nA rush of wind surrounded Leonel and a soft glow of light enveloped his body.\nIn just a few minutes, Leonel's body recovered to its peak state. Since he could recover so quickly, there was no need to wait. This situation was too dangerous to waste time in.\n'Interesting…'\nLeonel felt that his strength ticked up by a measure. In addition, his body also more thoroughly absorbed the Urbe Ore Essence he had been refining.\n'So if I break down my muscles and use [Minor Heal] on them, I can train faster…'\n[Minor Heal] was actually a One Star Magus Art despite its humble title. It was because of his ability to cast this that Lionus was so valued. If the prince knew that Leonel thought to use it just to enhance his training speed, who knows how he would react.\n'My mind is erratic and all over the place…'\nLeonel stood up from the bath, cleaning himself off and putting on another robe. He didn't like the style of dress of this world very much, but he had no choice.\n'I need a focus, a plan, a goal. If I keep going like this, I'll aimlessly wander around and fail to live up to my potential…'\nIn Leonel's life, there had never really been anything in his control. His profession was chosen for him, his meal plans and training schedule was set out for him, and he never truly figured out what he wanted to do in life.\nIt was no wonder he seemed to be going on aimlessly. This was the first time he had no choice but to take charge.\nHis mind was filled with bits and pieces of information, but he realized after battle today that this wasn't good enough. It was alright that he wanted to learn everything he could about this world, but what would he do with that information? How would he execute with this new knowledge? What goal was he trying to reach?\nThat feeling he had had before the battle begun, that stifling feeling that made him feel uncomfortable to the depths of his soul… It was the first time Leonel grasped on something he wanted for himself.\nThis wasn't about his father, this wasn't about Aina, this was something that he, Leonel Morales, wanted for himself.\nIf he couldn't beat Lamorak into the ground, he would never feel at ease.\nLeonel entered the Lab Setting. In this world, he had always had to be exceptionally careful about using the Segmented Cube so he had rarely entered it. If it wasn't because the Large Barracks were in turmoil, preparing for war, and as such had no time to mind him, he wouldn't have dared to even now.\nLeonel cast a glance toward the snowglobes and frowned.\n'Hm? Something feels off about this atmosphere…?'\nAfter a moment, Leonel realized what it was. There was a density of Dark Elemental Force in the air.\nUnderstanding this, Leonel didn't pay it anymore mind. The Border Region had a higher concentration of this energy. It wasn't surprising that the Segmented Cube which was always absorbing and purifying Force for Leonel's use would react in this way to such an environment.\nLeonel sat at his Crafting Table. The more time he spent near it, the more he realized that this odd desk with different sized wells on its was most definitely a treasure in its own right. But, Leonel hadn't quite reached a level where he could dig out its secrets.\n'What I need is a focused structure. I've already learned all I can about Mage Arts. The only thing holding me back in that regard is the Crystallization of my Spirit Pressure.'\nThough Leonel could cast Magus Arts now, their power was lacking in comparison to true Magi. This wasn't something he could fix in a short time. After all, Magi spend decades meditating to crystallize their Spirit Pressure. It was something only time could do.\nOf course, Leonel's meditation was far more beneficial than one might expect. He suspected that it would only take a year or two to crystallize his spirit to an extreme. Once that happened, his combat prowess would be enough to run through this world unimpeded.\nAs such, Leonel made a decision.\n'After awakening the Wisdom Branch, I could split my mind six ways. After crystallizing my Soul Force a bit, I can do so eight ways now. I'll save one to focus on meditation. As for the remaining seven…'\nLeonel crossed his legs and closed his eyes. He used one of his eight minds to meditate, another to monitor the situation outside the Segmented Cube, and as for the remaining six… He sent them all into the Spear Domain!\nLeonel's mind appeared within the dark world. Rolling clouds thunders above his head and pale black-grey earth crunched beneath his feet.\nAt this moment, he stood at the peak of a large hill, a familiar black spear wrapped in chain before him.\nThe immediate surroundings of this spear was empty. As though showing reverence to its superiority, the other spears that dotted this hill were at least three meters away.\nThis was the first peak of Spear Domain that Leonel had conquered. But, he knew he hadn't done so correctly.\nOne's spirit was only meant to be auxiliary in this world. The main strength should have been his Spear Force. If it wasn't for his awakening his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor, Leonel would have no right to stand in this place, and the spear before him seemed to understand this as well.\nThis standoffishness placed a veil between Leonel and the spear, making it more difficult for him to comprehend the secrets surrounding it.\nLeonel smiled lightly.\n\"You're quite an arrogant spear. There are hundreds on your level in this world, yet you still have such pride…\"\nAs though hearing the taunting nature of Leonel's words, the Spear vibrated slightly, but didn't do much else. It was as though it disdained to respond. But, Leonel didn't mind.\n\"There are 2879 spears that make up the foundation for your Spear Domain. I'll start at the bottom just like you want me to. It won't be long before you become obedient.\"\nWith a thought, Leonel sent his mind toward the spears around the bottom of his Spear Peak, grasping out at six simultaneously.\nAt that moment, he entered six different worlds and experienced six different lives.",

      "content": "The location was dark. It was difficult even to see one's hand even if it was placed before one's eye.\nUp above, the place the moon should have been was completely shrouded by dark clouds that rumbled every so often. However, even this rumbling couldn't mask the heavy breathing that pervaded the atmosphere.\nAt that moment, a group of men and women ran with everything they had. But, their speed was slow. Whether it was because of the disadvantageous terrain or the fact they were at the end of their ropes, both were reasons.\nThe group of 30 or so wore bits of torn linen covered in dirt and mud. It was impossible for fugitives to appear in the Border Region. The only explanation was that these few consciously chose to discard their armor.\nAt that moment, one of them suddenly stumbled and fell..\n\"Kid!\"\nAn older man snapped his head around, reaching beneath the arms of the fallen knight and pulling him up.\nHe was the only one who stopped. It wasn't that the others were callous, but rather that they were under expressed orders not to.\n\"Jejejejejeje…\"\nAn eerie laughter caused the blood of the group to run cold. They dug deep, pulling all the reserve strength they had left to power forward.\nThe forest they ran in could hardly be called as such. It looked as though a blazing fire had charred everything to ash. Let alone having canopies of greenery, the various trees didn't even have branches, they were made entirely of blackened and battered trunks.\nIt was one of the roots of these godforsaken trees that had tripped the young knight.\nIt was quite hilarious. Even as the young knight held back tears, unable to take his eyes off of the commanding officer who had come back to save him, he too found the humor in this situation.\nHe, a dignified Three Star Official Knight, had been beaten and battered to the point of tripping and falling. Not only that, but he had actually fractured his ankle and couldn't even walk on his own anymore.\n\"Captain, just leave me.\"\n\"Shut up, kid. You know how many sacks of potatoes twice your size I've carried in my life to reach my current strength? You're as light as a feather. Don't look down on a Grand Knight, rookie.\"\nThe young knight was speechless. In the end, he could only chuckle and shake his head.\nThe eerie laughter only grew with each passing moment. And, despite the blustering of the Captain, he was falling further and further behind the group ahead of him.\nAt that moment, the Captain felt a sharp wind assaulting his back. With his years of trained reflexes, he didn't even need to think before he jumped to the side. He had already reached a state of his mind and actions being as one.\nAt this point, the Captain knew that it was useless to keep running.\nWith a SHIIING, he unsheathed his long sword, setting down the young knight that hung next to his hip.\n\"Keep running kid. I'll hold these bastards back.\"\nThe young knight clenched his teeth.\nRun? He probably could. If he used his Force to reinforce his ankle, he could probably last another half hour. Such a skill was something he had learned as a mere Apprentice Knight. The only reason the older knight hadn't allowed him to do so was because their Force was already running low. If used on such a technique, his likelihood of surviving would plummet with each passing moment.\nBut, he was completely unwilling.\n\"We'll do it together, Captain.\"\nThe young knight grit his teeth, his Internal Strength blooming and shielding the fracture in his foot. He pulled out his own sword, standing tall.\nThe Captain wanted to say something more, but the sharp wind of another arrow came forth.\nHe stepped forward, his long sword arching beneath the night air. It became the only source of light in the darkness, drawing the arc of a beautiful crescent moon.\nBANG!\nThe Captain stumbled backward, his wrist quaking beneath the pressure. His expression couldn't help but change, how could an arrow have so much strength behind it? Just what was happening?\n\"Jejejejeje…\"\nAt that moment, a shadow slid out from the darkness. Even though it was just a few steps away from the pair, it was difficult to see it even now.\nHowever, after a moment, the Captain quivered.\n\"Demon Lord!\"\nHe didn't know who it was, nor did he need to know. All he needed was his years of experience to tell just how powerful the existence before him was.\nThe young knight felt his heart seize.\n\"Kid, I'm going to go all out. When I engage him, turn back and run as fast as you can. Don't stay here for some meaningless sacrifice.\"\nThe old knight stepped forward. The means of a knight truly weren't few. Amongst them, there were even techniques that could be used to overdraw one's potential. It was precisely such a technique that the Captain was planning on using now.\nHe didn't give the young knight a chance to respond. His aura blazed, his arm bulging with muscles and wildly pulsing veins.\nIn one motion, he hooked a hand behind the young knight, took a half spin, and sent him flying into the distance.\nThough he had been just blustering before, that didn't mean his words didn't have a kernel of truth to them. As? a One Star Grand Knight, throwing 200 pounds a few dozen meters away wasn't a problem at all.\nHowever, what happened next left the Captain stunned.\n\"Oof…\"\nThe young knight should have been sent into the distance. But, just as he was passing between two trees, and before he could even pick up any true momentum, he rammed into something.\n\"Hey Captain… Your aim needs a little help…\"\nA light, awkward cough sounded. The trouble was that the old knight didn't recognize the voice at all.\nAt first, he shuddered. Was there another enemy he hadn't noticed? In this darkness, it truly was too difficult to see. But, even then, shouldn't he have sensed an aura?\nAnyone who could utilize Force had Internal Sight. It was a prerequisite. However, the Internal Sight of a knight was destined to be weaker than that of a mage.\nThat said, as a Grand Knight, how could the Internal Sight of this captain be so weak to the point of missing someone just meters from him? That was impossible… Unless…\nThis foe was just that much stronger than him?!\nThe captain felt a cold chill. He was already ready to die, but the direction he had thrown the young knight in was the direction the others had fled. Didn't that mean that this monstrous individual had already eliminated them all? And in that case, what was the point of his sacrifice?\nHowever, just when he was despairing, words that shocked him were spoken.\n\"Who are you?!\"\nAt that moment, the eerie laughter had come to a full stop. The shadow looked toward the voice that had caught the young knight as well for one simple reason… it too hadn't sensed another person until now.\nThe sound of soft footsteps sounded as a young man vaguely came into view.\n\"To think all these Light Elemental luminescence arts would actually come in handy…\"\nThe voice muttered to himself, his words completely lost beneath the rumbling of the dark clouds above.\n\"#62 Demon Lord Maugrier, is it? Come taste my spear.\"\nLeonel grinned, the whites of his teeth shimmering beneath the night sky.",

      "content": "\"Hm? Running away… My combat strength is still lacking…\"\nLeonel was a bit disatisfied with his performance. In truth, he could have caught up with the Demon Lord had he truly wanted to. The main issue was that the mission he was assigned was to bring these escapees back with him.\nIt had been about half a month since the battle at the Large Barracks. As Lancelot had feared, the Demons had indeed begun a large scale offensive. As a result, many of the Small Barracks had been taken out.\nDue to this, the knights and mages that had been posted at these Small Barracks were forced into retreating, leading to the situation here today.\nWhat was surprising, though, was that a Demon Lord had actually personally come to chase them. Leonel didn't know if this Demon Lord was just bored or if there was another reason, but he couldn't fathom a true reason why a Demon Lord would chase after a group of 30 or so like this. What was the point?\nLeonel looked back to find the old and young knight looking at him with incredulous expressions..\nHow could they not be shocked? This was a Demon Lord they were talking about. Even battling one to a standstill was impressive, let alone forcing one into retreat. But, from Leonel's words, it sounded like he wasn't satisfied with this?\n\"Let's go, I'll bring you out of here.\"\nLeonel put away an ordinary wooden spear, facing the two knights.\n\"… Y-yes…\"\nThe young knight managed to eek out.\nCompared to his Captain, he was even more shocked. That was because he had been caught by Leonel earlier.\nAccording to common sense, being thrown with such force and stopping so abruptly should have hurt at least one of them if not both. Even if Leonel's strength was beyond the point of allowing him to be hurt by such a thing, at the very least, he alone should have been hurt.\nYet, not only did Leonel fully stop his momentum without issue, but neither of them were injured. In the moment, he only felt that he was enveloped by a soft force. Then, he came to a stop and was rested on the ground.\nSuch a boundary of strength… he couldn't even comprehend it.\nThere were no limit to knights that could stop his momentum and leave unscathed. But… doing so while allowing him to remain uninjured at the same time…?\nEven his Captain was nothing but an ant before these things.\nThe young knight blankly followed behind Leonel, his mind lost in the clouds.\n\"Captain!\"\nA group of knights ahead sighed a breath of relief when they saw their Captain return safely. Numerous thankful gazes landed on Leonel.\n\"There's no time right now.\" Leonel waved away their thank you's. \"It's highly likely that there will be more enemies coming. I've cast [Silence] on our surroundings. Don't mind the noise you're making, just run with all you have.\"\nLeonel spoke quickly.\n'[Silence]? Isn't that an immobile spell? But the way this senior is talking about it, it's as though it will follow us around? How is that possible?'\nThe young knight was dumbfounded.\nThough he was a knight, he had trained with mages many times before. After all, knights and mages needed to work together to defend the Barracks. A common spell like [Silence] that could be used by any Official Mage was definitely something he was familiar with.\nLeonel didn't bother to explain. His Internal Sight had already stretched out. He realized that his previous speculations had been correct. This Demon Lord chased after this group alone for his own sadistic reasons, but now that Leonel was here, he had retreated to regroup with his men. It could be said that the true chase was only starting now.\n\"[Trace: Arrow].\"\nA surge of wind surrounded Leonel. Soon, a pale blue arrow was formed, hovering about his palm. In the darkness, it was particularly striking. But, it was also dim enough that it couldn't be seen from too far away.\n\"Follow this arrow and you'll be able to meet up with the others.\"\nThe Captain's expression changed at these words.\n\"But…\"\n\"I know what you want to say. You split up to begin with so that you'd be more difficult to find. But, you don't need to worry about this anymore. Sir Peirce is leading his troops toward the region of your #19 Small Barracks, so they won't be able to continue chasing you for long. I'm just the vanguard.\"\nThe Captain's eyes brightened along with his small squadron's. They thought they were finished. But it seemed that they had hope now.\nThere was one among them that only grew more and more shocked with every word Leonel spoke, though. And that person was the young knight.\n'[Trace: Arrow]? That spell should only be able to work if the mage is present, but the way senior is talking about it, it's as though he doesn't need to be here at all.\n'The range of [Trace: Arrow] is extremely limited as well…'\n[Trace: Arrow] was a tandem spell, meaning it had a partner. [Trace: Target] was a seal type spell that [Trace: Arrow] was able to home in on.\nThe issue was that the maximum range of this tandem spell was one mile. But the distance between the separated group was at least ten times that, or else what was the point in running separately?!\nThe young knight didn't believe for a moment that Leonel didn't know this.\n'Just who is he…'\nAt that moment, the sight of several torches approaching from the distance lit the night skies.\n\"Go, now.\" Leonel said sternly.\nHis carefree demeanor had vanished. Facing just one Demon Lord wasn't a problem. But, facing one leading a squad of 50 or so was a completely different matter.\nHowever, this was the kind of challenge Leonel wanted.\nWithout waiting for the knights behind him to respond, he shot forward.\nIn his hand an odd spear appeared. It was about two meters long, a normal length for such a weapon, albeit shorter than Leonel's Spear Peak black spear.\nHowever, this wasn't the true oddity. Normally, a spear's blade would only be a small percentage of the length of the weapon. But, this spear was vastly different. Its blade was a third of the length of the spear!\nLeonel brandished the spear, casting [Shining Eyes] on his irises.\nIn that moment, his vision and Internal Sight superimposed, giving him a clear vision of everything happening on the forest floor that night.\nHis gaze flashed with determination, his Dreamscape flashing with arcs of lightning as several spear styles began to coalesce in his mind.",

      "content": "\"Jejejejeje… I've never understood humans, always doing such brainless things.\"\nMaugrier was a bit stunned when he noticed Leonel running back toward him. He had suffered no small loss at Leonel's hands just earlier, he had even felt the scent of death. If it wasn't because this boy was too inexperienced in combat, failing to take proper account of their combat environment, he would have died here.\nBut, he could have never expected that Leonel would come rushing back after he was prepared. He had been gloomy previously, thinking that he would have long since lost track of Leonel. But it seemed like he would have his chance at revenge after all.\n\"Wall.\"\nWhen Maugrier realized that Leonel hadn't even paused his steps, he grew serious. He had no intention of facing up against Leonel directly.\n.\nOne shouldn't mistake Maugrier's reaction as fear… After all, he was an archer. It was only normal that Leonel would be able to force him to suffer a loss in close combat. Now that he was prepared, he could almost already see Lenoel's corpse!\nWhat this #62 ranked Demon Lord didn't know that while he saw Leonel as easy prey, Leonel saw him as a fighting dummy, ready to help refine his skills.\nWhile others could only see shadows in this place, Leonel saw everything reflected into his mind perfectly. He could see the shadow-like Maugrier sneakily drawing his bow, he could see the vanguard of shield warriors blocking his path, he could even see the dark insects crawling along the ground.\nNothing escaped his notice.\nLeonel's Force bloomed.\nBANG!\nSeven shield warriors stood shoulder to shoulder, slamming their tower shields into the ground and blocking Leonel's path forward. At this moment, it became clear that Maugrier didn't care about the other escaping warriors. Killing one Leonel was worth far more than killing a thousand such knights.\nLeonel's memories flashed.\nIn his mind, he saw a valiant man with dark blond hair that whisked along his face and jaw like the mane of a lion.\nHe wore heavy bronze armor, his every step causing the earth to quake. His heavy spear bent beneath the weight of its own blade, making it exceptionally top heavy. Yet, the valiant man outstretched it with a single hand, bearing the entire weight with his strong wrists.\nLeonel could sense the overbearing aura of the man. Even if he stood against an army of thousand alone, he would face it with a jovial laugh.\nWhen this man walked, the earth shook. When he laughed, the clouds dispersed. When he attacked, the skies split.\nLeonel's back flexed, his image and the image of the man in his mind fusing into one. The crackling booms of his tendons reverberated through the night sky. Maugrier didn't even have time to draw back his first arrow.\nBOOM!\nLeonel's body and spear drew a line in the air. For a moment, their momentum became one.\nIt was once again a pierce. However, compared to the fluttering speed of the primitive woman, this pierce was indomitable. It was as though it would sheer through any obstacle before it, not even pausing before the might of a God.\nLeonel's spear tip tore into the middle tower shield.\nAs though it was slammed by a canon ball or punched by a goliath, a massive dent appeared at its center.\nThe shield warrior cried out in pain as he felt the arm supporting his tower shield bend against the distorted metal. It was as though his arm was molded into a semi-sphere, grinded into complete mush.\nA gap appeared amidst the shield warriors as their fellow soldier was sent flying. Like a bullet leaving a barrel, he tore through the night air, crashing into the reserve warriors by Maugrier's side.\nDespite the shock, Maugrier was still a Demon Lord. He didn't hesitate to loose three arrows in quick succession when he saw that the situation was bad.\nHowever, what Leonel feared the least were projectiles with predictable trajectories. The battlefield reflected in his mind. Before Maugrier even released the first arrow, Leonel already knew where it would land.\nAs though he was a ghost, Leonel shifted away with simple steps.\nHis memories flashed once more. He saw a woman of strong features. Despite the fact she wasn't the most beautiful, she had a charm that gripped the hearts of men. But, she also held a spear that took the hearts of men.\nHer speed was so blinding that the last thing her enemies sensed before their death wasn't pain, nor the sight of her figure, but rather the fragrance of her fluttering hair.\nA rich smell of apple. It assaulted Leonel's senses again and again as though she was right before him at this very moment.\nHer spear was as light as a feather and as flexible as a whip. She reaped lives with a thought and traveled through the world unhindered.\nLeonel's toe lightly descended to the ground the moment he dodged the last spear. For an instant, it seemed as though he would flutter to the ground like a leaf, but in the next instant, he vanished.\nHis movement speed was impossibly quick. His body shot forward like a streaking arrow, appearing before the line of protection before Maugrier.\nHe braced his spear against his body before sweeping it out horizontally from himself.\nHis spear became like the whipping tail of a mighty beast. It left an arc of blood in the air, sheering apart half a dozen demons at the waist. Such carnage was something even Leonel had never seen before.\nIn the past, he always killed his opponents with a simple pierce. The blood was minimal and the wound was small.\nThis was the most powerful attack of the spear currently in his possession. Its exceptionally long blade was purposely designed for this expressed purpose.\nAnd now… There was no one but Maugrier before him.\nMaugrier reacted quickly. In the face of death, his expression, hidden beneath his hood, remained calm. Demon Lords weren't fish on a chopping block. No matter how much improvement Leonel had made, it wasn't enough to treat such a character so casually — especially when it had only been half a month since his battle with Gorgo.\nThe twang of a bow string being continuously pulled and released caused Leonel's ears to twitch. Maugrier's actions were so fast that Leonel's eyes, even with the support of his Mage Art, couldn't keep up.\nThe distance between the two was just 10 meters. To take on the full barrage of arrows at this distance, anyone else would have had their deaths guaranteed.\nBut, while Leonel's eyes couldn't keep up, that didn't mean his Internal Sight was in the same situation. The trajectory of Maugrier's arrows had already been projected into his mind.\nJust when Leonel was about to dodge just as easily, his expression change.\nThe trajectories he had predicted were off!",

      "content": "Though it was only by a few centimeters, the overall result would be far different than what he anticipated.\nLeonel's blood boiled and his spine ran cold.\nIn such a threatening situation, he grew more focused, his thinking speed accelerating so quickly that time seemed to slow.\nIn an instant, Leonel zipped through all of the potential countermeasures he had and responded with the best.\nBANG!\nHis foot slammed into the ground, a swirl of wind and oppressive Spirit Pressure surging around him.\n\"[Earthen Wall]. [Layering Arts]. [Harden].\"\n.\nIt was impossible to cast a spell so quickly. Even for Leonel.\nAn arrow crossing ten meters was the matter of a blink of an eye. But, even Leonel's fastest cast would take a full second.\nHowever… It was then Leonel's Dreamscape flashed, sending out a branch of lightning.\nIn the core of it all, a book stood: 'Fostering a Mage's Battle Sense'. In fact, it wasn't just the book, but a specific chapter by the title of 'Spirit Pressure Storms'.\nThere were many things that could influence a mage's casting. Depending on the environment, there were an infinite number of variables. One such variable was the so-called 'Spirit Pressure Storm'.\nWhen a high level Mage Art was cast, it would cause Force to converge. High concentrations of Force made it more difficult to control, especially when the concentration was of an opposing Force type to the one you were trying to use.\nFor example, trying to cast a large scale Water Elemental magic right after someone cast a Fire Elemental magic was several degrees more difficult.\nIf Maugrier's arrows weren't on Leonel's predicted trajectory, there was only one explanation: He had used Force to control their flight.\nIf Leonel took advantage of this and applied the concepts of 'Spirit Pressure Storms' here, he could disrupt Maugrier's control!\nSHUUU!\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath as he felt two arrows tear through the skin on his shoulder.\nTaking a step forward, he cut down on the last one, continuing to close the distance.\nMaugrier's expression changed.\nAt first, he had sneered seeing Leonel's reaction. Though he had been surprised that Leonel was a mage, after a moment, he laughed in his heart. How could he not?\nLeonel started to cast three different spells at once. Even the weakest, [Harden], should have taken a veteran mage two seconds to cast. To make it worse, [Layering Arts] was a high level auxiliary Mage Art that multiplied the strength of spells by stacking them.\n[Layering Arts] alone would take a talented Magus upwards of ten seconds to cast alone. In such a situation, Leonel was bound to die.\nMaugrier had thought that Leonel was simply a talented fool with no battle experience, but this situation completely upended his world.\nThe fact Leonel completely dispelled his attempted casting right after deflecting his last arrow told him all he needed to know. The truth shocked him to his core.\nAs a Demon Lord and a veteran of the battlefield, he obviously knew that high fluctuations of Force would disrupt techniques. But, this was the first time he had ever seen anyone use it in battle!\nMaugrier's expression changed, he had laid his guard down when he saw Leonel's stupid attempt. He had been waiting to see a grand show, but now he had yet to draw more arrows while Leonel had already halved the distance between them.\n\"My Lord!\"\nMaugrier's death guards surged forward to try to protect him.\n'If I'm blocked again, he'll have time to recover and pester me with more arrows. If I can't read the trajectory of his arrows, it'll be too difficult to dodge at such close range.'\nThinking to this point, Leonel had already made a decision. As much as he wanted to temper his spear skills here, this wasn't an appropriate occasion.\nHe stepped forward again. The trembling of the earth that matched his steps made the demons around him feel as though the world was collapsing.\nLeonel's Spirit Pressure surged into the earth beneath his feet.\n'Impossible!'\nMaugrier's expression turned solemn. He had been too busy snickering at Leonel earlier to realize, but this boy was actually directly manipulating the earth.\nUsually, mages would pull on free elements from the atmosphere. Using already existing elements was far more difficult and took far more Spirit Pressure than directly creating your own as counter intuitive as that might sound.\nMages who could manipulate the elements in their natural state were favored even amongst Childes. The disparity between them and normal mages was like the difference between clear waters and mud!\nEven further, an Earth Mage who could do such a thing would be a bane to all warriors who called them an enemy. The reason was simple. Not every place had water or fire or strong winds, but any place there were humans there would be earth!\n\"[Earthen Tide].\"\nLeonel didn't even need to fully construct the Mage Art. He didn't need a tall tide. He just needed something that could quickly impede Maugrier's men. And that was exactly what he received.\nThe earth rose into a small rolling hill. It was barely half a meter tall and not usually enough to do much of anything. But, this was exactly what Leonel needed.\nIn a flash, Leonel appeared before Maugrier, his spear descending from the skies with an undying momentum.\nMaugrier cried out in shock, raising his bow into the air to block. It was all he had on him, what else could he possibly use?\nOne might expect a bow to not last even a second in an exchange with a spear, but reality was much different.? A loud clang was all Leonel needed to hear to know Maugrier had successfully blocked. But…\nSo what?\nLeonel used his downward strike to gather up momentum, flowing into his next strike with a seemingly practiced ease. Though it still lacked the air of a true spearman, it was clear that Leonel was improving by leaps and bounds everyday.\nMaugrier grunted. He was just an archer, how could he possibly match up to Leonel in strength? His claim to fame was his special telekenetic ability to control his Force, a power bestowed to him by Lord Modred. He didn't have the strong body of other demons. He was happy enough just to survive the first strike.\nUnfortunately for him, while his body was weak, his close combat was even weaker. He had hardly registered what happen when a sharp pain came from his waist.\nMaugrier felt the pain surging through his veins. It was the worst pain he had ever experienced in his life. He could faintly tell that when his pain reached such a threshold that… his life was truly finished.\nHe plopped to the ground before Leonel's frowning figure, unable to gather the strength to rise up.\n'I didn't manage to cut him all the way in half. It's either my strength is still lacking or that my technique isn't perfect just yet…'\nLeonel had only managed to cut half way through Maugrier's waist and he was seemingly disappointed by the results, causing the demons around him to shiver in fear.",

      "content": "Leonel took a deep breath.\nHe managed to kill a Demon Lord without invoking his Metal Synergy Runes. This could be considered improvement, but he still wasn't happy with this result. He felt that dealing with Maugrier wouldn't have been a problem for him even half a month ago.\n'I'm learning all these spear techniques, but chaining them together well is too difficult… I need a new direction…'\nAfter steadying his breathing, Leonel looked up to find the remaining demons inching away from him. It was clear that if they weren't worried that Leonel would stab them in the back, they would have long since turn and run. They were all veteran warriors. They knew that with such a large disparity in strength, and especially since Leonel was a mage, they'd be finished unless they banded together.\nHowever, what they never expected was for Leonel to do nothing to them. Even up until the point the first of them ran away, he didn't lift a single finger.\n.\nIn Leonel's mind, he didn't benefit entering such a battle. Without a leader, these demons wouldn't be able to organize themselves to continue the chase. At best, they'd be able to regroup with another Demon Lord. But, by then, Sir Peirce would be in position and things would become much easier.\nInstead of putting his life on the line fighting so many enemies alone, it was best to take advantage of their fear and allow them to run away. Leonel wasn't an invincible god. Fighting almost 50 opponents by himself was far too difficult.\nThough he had feats beyond this in the France Zone, it had to be remembered that those were normal humans without special abilities. Leonel wouldn't play with his life like that in this place.\nLeonel bent forward, picking up the bow Maugrier had dropped.\n\"Oh…?\"\nLeonel was stunned.\nThe bow had a sleek coldness to it that reminded Leonel of polished stainless steel. However, it was oddly both black and rough to the touch, almost like sand paper.\nBut this wasn't what shocked Leonel. What truly caused him to pause was just how heavy the bow was. It weighed at least 50 pounds, and that was already about half the heft of his black spear.\n'Now that I think about it, a huge part of the reason Maugrier was able to shoot and reload so quickly was because he didn't pull the bowstring back very far…'\nLeonel replayed the battle in his mind. He clearly remembered that the cloaked Demon Lord's firing was almost like flicking a finger.\nIn the heat of battle, Leonel didn't think much of it. But now that he had the time, he realized that the only explanation for this must be because this bow was just that powerful. Even with such a small pull, it could have such power…\nLeonel had always been good with long distance weapons. In truth, this was likely a large part of the reason why his Gene Assessment had set him as a star quarterback. He was very good at reading a target's intentions and pinpointing a throw in their direction. This was something he only got even better at after his ability awakened.\nA large part of the reason Leonel chose an atlatl as his first ranged weapon was because the throwing motion was the same he was used to.\nAfter that, his first craft was a pair of pistols. But, his strength was already beginning to leave those long barreled pistols behind to the point he rarely used them in battle anymore. It couldn't be helped, they were at most C or B-grade treasures to begin with and he didn't like having to constantly repair the nozzles like he did.\nLeonel had never really thought about supplementing his long ranged abilities with a bow and arrow before. But now that he did, he realized it wasn't a bad idea.\nAn arrow would always be able to travel further than he could throw something. Though it sacrificed a bit of flexibility as a result, judging by how powerful this bow would be with just the flick of a finger, it might still be a good option.\n'Hm… I'll keep it with me, I guess. Even if I can't take it out of this Zone, since I'll be here for such a long period of time anyway it'll still be of some use.'\nLeonel put away his spear and tested the bow string.\n\"Ah…!\"\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath. He realized in that moment that had he not reacted quickly, he would have lost the tips of his fingers.\nWhy was this bowstring so sharp?\n'… It's not that it's sharp, but that it takes so much strength to pull that it exerts too much strain on my fingers… but if that's the case, how did such a weak Demon Lord pull it?'\nLeonel flipped over Maugrier's corpse and checked his hands. Soon, he understood.\nFirst, Maugrier's hands were covered in coarse gloves made of an extraordinarily sturdy material. Not only that, but they were also thick to the point it made him look as though he had paws for hands.\nHowever, even with that, Leonel could see deep grooves on Maugrier's pointer and ring finger. It was clear that Maugrier likely replaced these gloves very often.\n'There's also a lot of Force concentration on his fingers, it's the combination of these factors that allowed him to do this…'\nLeonel made up his mind. He was still a Force Crafter, after all though he hadn't had time to design any new crafts recently. But, this position he took up on the border gave him a lot more flexibility and there were less eyes watching him. He could definitely make something better than this.\nAfter making up his mind, Leonel took off Maugrier's spatial brace. It covered about half of his forearm and had a total of six small spatial spaces within, five of which were filled with arrows of various kinds and the final of which had miscellaneous things.\n'Oh?'\nSomething caught Leonel's attention within the last space. He quickly took it out.\nThe object was a crystal that very much reminded Leonel of the ones he had seen within the Magic Art Tower. After sinking his mind into it, he found exactly what he had expected. Or, not...\n'[Merlin's Bestowal: Bowman King].'\n\"Wait, what?\"",

      "content": "Leonel was stunned.\nThis was the third time he was seeing Merlin's name in such an important setting. Though there were some legends about him in the Mage Academy Library, Leonel didn't really pay much attention to it. This was because those books were too low level. The information practically bordered on fairy tale.\nHowever, things were a bit different now…\nThe first time Leonel saw his name was after entering the Joan Zone. Apparently those matters were related to a prophecy he had made in the past.\nThe second time he saw it was when he entered this Mythological Zone. Once again, it was related to a prophecy this Merlin had made in the past again.\nThis was now the third time Leonel had seen this name in a surprising capacity.. It could be said that this was the last thing he had ever expected to find.\nAt the same time, Leonel wondered why it was Maugrier was so weak with such an inheritance on him. How could he be ranked in the 60's amongst Demon Lords? But after a moment of thought, he realized that this might have been the wrong way to look at things.\nIt might very well be possible that the former Maugrier wasn't worthy of ever becoming a Demon Lord in his lifetime until he stumbled into this inheritance. If Leonel looked at things like this, then it was very possible.\nIf Leonel took it one step further, it had to be remembered that Merlin was a hero of the human world, not the demon world. To the demons, he should have been a great enemy. After all, he was responsible for the rise of King Arthur.\nSince that was the case, such an inheritance might not be suited to demons for use to begin with. If that was the case, then the fact Maugrier made it so far with it just went to show just how special the inheritance in this crystal was.\n'Wow…'\nLeonel felt like the crystal was an all new world. Unlike the crystals of the Magic Art Tower which only had a single Mage Art within them, this crystal was separated into several layers, each holding a different truth of the path of a bowman.\nThere were spells for enhancing eyesight, for accelerating an arrow mid-flight, and there was even meditation techniques for knights and mages within it.\nThe meditation techniques of this Mythological Zone all had one purpose: to Crystallize Force. Or rather, what the people of this Zone called either Spirit Pressure or Internal Strength.\nSpirit Pressure meditation techniques compressed the Soul Force in one's Ethereal Glabella. Internal Strength meditation techniques compressed the Force within one's Force Nodes.\nThere were no limitations to meditation techniques, they could be used no matter which step of cultivation one was at. So, it was no problem for Leonel to start late.\nHowever, there were obviously tiers of quality amongst meditation techniques. Some excelled in the degree to which one could compress and other excelled in the speed compression occurred, but those that could do both to perfection were rare.\nThe Mage Academy provided many types of meditation techniques. In fact, Leonel had dozens in his Dreamscape at this very moment. It was precisely because of this that he could see that Merlin's meditation technique was far beyond anything he had ever seen before.\n'It pulls on the power of the stars? What a fantastical meditation technique…'\nLeonel felt that this meditation technique resonated with him on a profound level. He felt that maybe this so-called power of the stars might be greatly beneficial to him.\nMaybe there was a reason his Lineage Factor was named the Snowy Star Owl.\nHowever, Leonel didn't immediately make this connection. This wasn't because he was stupid or that his Dreamscape was still lacking — though the latter might be part of the reason — but rather because he was a man of the modern era.\nTo people of backward, medieval era places like this, stars were mysterious entities and sometimes even gods looking down on them. However, to Leonel, they were massive balls of flaming gas. What could possibly be special about them?\nThough Leonel had this inherent bias ingrained within him, he also knew that any techniques that appeared in this world would be real. He also had to admit that in this new world, where there were Dimensions above the third and abilities he couldn't imagine, it wasn't appropriate for him to try to reconcile everything with his own limited knowledge.\n'My main focus will still be the spear, but there's a lot of useful things in here. Since I'm talented in the bow, it won't hurt to take a look…'\nWith that thought, Leonel began to walk back, already drafting up plans for a protective covering for his fingers. He wanted it to be light weight and also not interfere with his spear wielding. If it could add special attributes to his arrows as well, that might be nice….\nLeonel drafted tens of possible plans in his Dream World as he walked. Before he realized it, he had already walked out of the ash forest, finding an army led by Sir Peirce before him.\nSir Peirce sat atop his horse, his snake-like eyes observing Leonel curiously.\n\"… Demon Lord Maugrier is dead.\" Leonel finished his report under the astonished gazes of Peirce's death guards.\nPeirce's eyes narrowed. He looked Leonel up and down for a long while, but didn't find anything off about him. Leonel didn't even look particularly tired.\nThe actions of the demons had been getting more and more aggressive over the past month. It could be said that the number of clashes between human and demonkind, likewise, increased exponentially.\nYet, in all this time, the number of high level figures that had fallen was zero. Unless… one counted the two Demon Lords that had both fallen at Leonel's hands.\nThe truth was that there were simply too many demons. There were many Demon Generals who rivaled Demon Lords in potential and strength but were never promoted for fear of the 66 limit. Even if Leonel killed them, there would probably be a new 66th ranked Demon Lord by tomorrow. But, even with this being the case, Leonel's feats were too shocking.\nSince when were Demon Lords so easy to kill? There was definitely something about this child's calculative abilities and mind that were beyond expectations. Of course, there was also the factor his enemies underestimating him due to his age, but this didn't diminish the impressiveness by much at all.\nSeemingly thinking of something, Sir Peirce opened his mouth to speak.\n\"Remember, boy, don't forget the rules of Camelot.\"\nSir Peirce didn't elaborate on his words at all, but Leonel understood what he meant. Though rare, there was no small number of humans who had fallen to the darker path. Many of those humans started by picking up things they shouldn't have from the bodies of demons…\nLeonel's eyes narrowed slightly, but he never got a chance to respond…\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nLeonel suddenly felt a strong case of dejavu overwhelm him. Hadn't this exact same thing occurred on the Project Hunt Island…?\nAt that moment, the dark night skies were illuminated by a dull gray pillar of light in the distance.\nWhat Leonel didn't know at that moment was that this wasn't a Force Eruption and… the true purpose behind the all out assault of the Demons was about to be revealed.",

      "content": "Leonel was shocked by the sudden change, as was everyone else. However, Leonel had long since gained a habit of paying attention to everything going on in his surroundings at once. This wasn't only a method of training his Internal Sight, but it was also a method of protecting his life.\nDue to this, Peirce's expression fell perfectly into Leonel's vision. The hint of surprise quickly followed by anticipation didn't escape him.\n'He knows what this thing is?'\nLeonel didn't think much of it. He knew too little about this world. It made sense that a veteran knight like Peirce would know more than he did. However, this only made Leonel more curious.\nThe reason was simple. While Peirce reacted in this way, none of his fellow knights or death guards did.. In that case, the most likely explanation was that this was very high level information. This was only made more obvious by the fact none of the books Loenel had read in the Mage Academy had the necessary information. If they did, his Dreamscape would have reacted.\nPeirce's expression changed many times before it seemed he finally settled on a decision.\n\"Arrange the formation! We're retreating back to the Large Barracks!\"\nPeirce's roar called out, causing the knights who had followed him here to be stunned for a moment.\nThe reason they had gathered here was to counter attack the demons. While they thought the humans were all converging back toward the Large Barracks, they'd be caught off guard by the sudden appearance of an army.\nYet, instead of waiting to deal this blow, Peirce actually decided to retreat immediately. It could only be said that whatever that pillar of light was, it was extraordinarily important.\nLeonel's gaze flashed, but he didn't say much. It could be said that the death of a Demon Lord was already a great result for this expedition. Even if it was easy for Modred to replace Demon Lords, they would still need time to acclimate themselves to their new strength.\n'I wonder what's going on…'\n…\nLeonel knew that this matter would be a big deal, but he could have never imagined just how great of a matter it would be. It was to the point that even the core city of Camelot was stirred.\nWhether it was the mysterious Grand Magi, the Knights of the Round Table, or even the lofty King and Queen of Camelot — Arthur and Guinevere — not a single one could sit still.\nBefore the sun rose on the horizon the following day, a single title had been ingrained in the minds of every human and demon across the Mythological Zone…\nThe Merlin Trials.\n**\nLeonel never expected he would have returned to Camelot so quickly. Of course, he had already mostly completed the mission he and Lionus had been assigned. They were only meant to be posted at the border regions for a single month and half of that time had already passed.\n\"Merlin Trials…?\"\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath.\nThe moment he heard these words, his Dreamscape reacted, numerous arcs of lightning branching to cover dozens of books.\nWithout exception, all of these books touched upon King Arthur's legend in one way or another. Despite not directly mentioning the Merlin Trials directly, Leonel came to understand something very important.\nIt was very likely that before the birth of Camelot, it was precisely these Merlin Trials that allowed King Arthur to gain the legacy he needed to rise to the top of this Mythological Zone.\nIf Leonel's conjectures were correct, this meant that these Merlin Trials were even more important than he originally assumed. It was no wonder Peirce's reaction was so fierce.\nThere was another matter as well, though…\nThe movements of the demons could have been considered to be exceptionally odd before the appearance of these trials. But, if the appearance of that pillar of light was taken into account, then it would explain everything.\nThe demons had forced the humans to retreat from the Small Barracks. The result of that was the humans losing the footholds they had gained around the trial location. Due to this, it was not only easier for the demons to enter, but it had suddenly become several times more difficult for humanity to do the same…\n'But isn't Merlin a hero of the humans…?'\nLeonel shook his head. Even if he was, just judging by how far Maugrier had gone with his Bowman King legacy it was obvious that the Merlin Trials should be beneficial to demons as well.\n'If this is all true, then why is it that I was recalled back to Camelot…? Shouldn't we all be trying our best to reclaim the land we lost in retreat?'\nAs Leonel was lost in thought, the person he most wanted to see now came. He really couldn't stifle his questions anymore.\nWhat were the Merlin Trials really? Why were they recalled to Camelot if it was so important?\nLeonel opened the doors to his residence only to find Elys on the other side.\nHe was a bit surprised. He had been certain that it would be Lionus, but it was Elys instead.\n\"The Prince was suddenly called by the Royal Court, so he sent me with his apologies for missing your meeting.\"\n\"Oh?\" Leonel nodded. \"It's not a big deal. You can come in, I do still have some questions.\"\nElys smiled and accepted Leonel's invitation.\nShe was surprised to see just how clean and meticulous Leonel's room was. It was almost as though he wasn't living in it at all. It couldn't be said that she entered the room of men often, but she knew that even a woman's room wouldn't necessarily be so orderly.\nOf course, what Elys didn't know was that this was the product of his father's teachings. It could be said that the only reason this side of Leonel didn't show more was because of how odd the times were. He didn't really have a place to call home on Earth currently unless the Segmented Cube was counted.\nEvery since Elys watched Leonel battle and kill Gorgo, she had become more reserved around him. Though she had known he was powerful after watching his battle with Lamorak, it was difficult to fuse the state he ended up in with a powerful persona.\n\"You can sit anywhere.\" Leonel said casually. \"Did you really only come here today to answer my questions? Or did you have another purpose?\"\n\"Oh!\" Elys snapped out of her thoughts. \"Yes, yes. I wanted to say that you've gained a great number of merits. The death of a Demon Lord is already enough to be promoted to a Two Star Magus. But, you actually killed two. This falls just a bit short of enough to become a Three Star Magus…\n\"As long as you pass the standardization tests, you'll be able to raise your standing in the Mage Academy.\"\nLeonel nodded, accepting the crystal Elys passed over to him. It likely held information about his merits and could be considered his proof.\n\"So about these Merlin Trials…\"\nLeonel tried to steer the conversation away from this topic. He wasn't very interested in? promotion right now. At most, he'd promote to a Three Star Official Mage so that he could read the Level Nine books within the library.\n\"This…\" Elys' eyes went dim for a moment. \"… Since you've gained so many merits, it should be fine…\n\"The Merlin Trials have existed even before His Majesty King Arthur established Camelot. It has picked a great many heroes in its time but His Majesty was the one who traveled the furthest down this road.\n\"The truth is that the Merlin Trials are separated into Minor Openings and Major Openings. This is most definitely a Major Opening.\n\"Minor Openings find individuals to test while Major Openings are open to all. But, in return, Major Openings are several times more dangerous, not only because of the trials within, but also because of our fellow man…\n\"It could be said that all the major players of Camelot and Modred's Demon Army have all benefited from the Merlin Trials in one way or another, so it's not a chance anyone wants to miss…\"\nLeonel's brows knit. Could it be that Maugrier's Bowman King inheritance was the product of a Minor Opening?\n\"Are there any other differences between a Minor and? Major Opening…?\"\nElys shook her head. \"It's too hard to tell. Normally, someone who benefitted from a Minor Opening wouldn't easily divulge this information. But, from what we do know, it should be impossible to gain the true core inheritances of Legendary Magus Merlin unless it's attained during the Major Opening…\n\"However, there are some clues that point toward the idea that having benefitted from a Minor Opening makes doing the same in a Major Opening easier…\n\"Some scholars believe that this is Legendary Magus Merlin picking out successors. He will first pick out individuals, then have them fight the masses to temper them…. 50 years ago, His Majesty King Arthur was one such person.\n\"The sword in the stone was his Minor Opening, and 50 years ago, he swept through the world of the Major Opening and established our Kingdom!\"",

      "content": "The more Leonel learned, the more confused he became. Weren't these Zones meant to be based on human mythology?\nWith this premise, one would assume that the most preeminent versions of King Arthur's tale would sit atop everything else.\nUntil now, things followed this logic. Whether it was Guinevere's betrayal, Modred's existence, the Knights of the? Round Table, or even the mention of the sword in the stone, everything was as Leonel was familiar with.\nHowever, if Leonel went a layer deeper than this, this world was still too different from what he was expecting. The existence of Lionus, the Magi, the existence of this world's magic system… None of these were things the tales of the past told of.\nLeonel couldn't tell whether or not these were random things the universe was filling in as it pleased, or if there was another, deeper reason for this change.\nEvery time Leonel thought about such things, his mind would inevitably travel back to one idea… the future can influence the past…\nIf that was the case, could it be that these changes weren't random as Leonel thought? But maybe the result of changes to the legend future generations made?\nWhen Leonel stepped on this path of thinking, he suddenly shuddered.. His mind had just landed on something that made his heart go cold…\nThe influence higher Dimensions had on lower Dimension was obscene. It might very well be possible that something a higher Dimensional being did on a whim would be more impactful than thousands of years worth of stories passed down in Leonel's world.\nAnd, if that was true…\n'… If someone from a higher Dimensional world wanted to change the legend of King Arthur… it would be exceptionally easy…'\nThis alone was a benign thought. But, when it was combined with Leonel's subconscious thoughts of several months, it felt as though a bolt of lightning had gone off in his mind. And this time, rather than being the illusory bolts of his Dreamscape, this was a true arc of lightning accompanied by rolling thunder.\nTo this point, leonel still had no idea what Joan's goal in the French Zone was. None of her actions made sense.\nBack then, Leonel simply followed his heart and did his best to save as many people as he could. It was never more complicated than this for him.\nBut, if he thought about it… what would happen if Joan succeeded? Was Joan succeeding mutually exclusive with him completing the Zone?\nThink about it for a moment. What would happen if Joan's purpose caused Leonel to fail?\nWell, Leonel and Aina would have then likely had to spend the rest of their lives in medieval France, growing old together. The details aren't very important… but, what is important is what would happen after they died…\nIn that case, wouldn't the Zone reset, allowing a new group to enter and attempt to clear it?\nIf that happened, what would have been the point of Joan's mission? What reason would there have been for her to hinder Leonel's success?\nIf that was the case, then their purpose couldn't have possibly been to hinder Leonel. If Leonel foolishly thought the matter would be over as long as he cleared the Zone, he would be sorely mistaken.\nThe more Leonel thought about it, the less sense it made. Unless…. The matters that occurred in Joan's Zone were related to this Mythological Zone!\nLeonel felt as though a thumping drum was raging through his Dreamscape. His ability seemed to be screaming at him, as though trying to tell him something he couldn't quite grasp.\nThis wasn't because there was a connection Leonel had yet to make, but rather because of the most unfortunate weakness of his Dreamscape… He simply didn't have enough information!\nWho were those people who almost turned Joan's Zone into a Unique Zone? How was Merlin's legend related to what they were trying to do? How was this Camelot Zone related to it all?\nLeonel grew more and more serious the longer he thought. He didn't even realize that Elys had shrunk into a corner like a timid little mouse, unable to even steady her breathing.\nUnfortunately, this matter was too important for Leonel to think about Elys' wellbeing.\nZones were inextricably linked to the future of Earth. Even though Leonel didn't have much ties to Earth remaining, his normal disposition wouldn't allow him to sit idly by as its fate was being toyed with.\nUnfortunately, Leonel didn't take part in every Zone clearance. It was impossible for him to do so even if he wanted to. As a result, he had no idea if other instances like what he and Aina lived through had occurred elsewhere…\nIt was very possible that as Earth cleared one Zone after another, they were simply playing into exactly what some other entity wanted…\n'According to Uncle Montez, Earth was among new worlds with the greatest potential even compared to the history of the universe. We have the talent necessary to become an Eighth Dimensional World. It's for this reason that so many Higher Dimensional worlds were invested in our progress and are even pooling together to give us rewards for the Zones we clear…\n'But what exactly does this higher potential mean? I don't believe that it's only as simple as reaching the Eighth Dimension…\n'No, that's not the right way to think about it. I should be wondering exactly what benefits come with having such high potential….\n'Potential… potential…'\nLeonel's eyes flashed open.\nMythological Zones were the treasures of the universe. No matter where they appeared, countless powers would fight for them. Of course, that was under the requirement that they all had access to the same world.\nRight now, Earth was in a protected state. It was difficult to travel from higher to lower Dimensions. This was a protection the universe gave not much unlike a mother did to a child in her womb.\nHowever, that didn't mean it was impossible. Though someone from the Fifth Dimension couldn't descend, someone in the weaker levels of the Fourth Dimension could pay a heavy price to descend.\nFor now, all of this wasn't very important. All Leonel was thinking about now was the Zone he was in now…\nMythological Zones were already so highly sought after. But, what if on top of being a Mythological Zone, it was born in a world with infinite potential. If that was the case, just what kind of treasures would such a place birth…?\n'So is that how it is?'\nLeonel knew that he had only grasped a small part of the truth. He also knew that it was impossible that this was the only goal of those people.\nWith how many legends and folktales Earth had, who knew how many of them were able to form Zones of their own. And, if there were many, it was impossible for Leonel to be at and protect them all.\nAll he could do was focus on what he could control. As long as he was here, he wouldn't allow these higher Dimensional beings to succeed.\nAt the same time, Leonel caught a faint inkling of why it was necessary to appear in Zones like Joan's…\nIf it was a matter of entering a historical Zone, it was only necessary to plant someone in that timeline. Though that seemed impossible to the current Leonel with his limited scope of understanding, he felt that for a higher Dimensional being, this was likely not impossible.\nHowever, how would one enter a Mythological Zone? It wasn't a true part of history, there was no place to 'return to'. It seemed the only way to enter was the Zone Gate itself, but Leonel could hazard a guess that the 12 who entered likely didn't have anything to do with these higher Dimensional beings.\nIt was possible that the Adurna family or even the Slayer Legion was related. If that was the case, then Leonel would simply accept that his hypothesis was incorrect. But… in the case the Adurna family wasn't responsible, then that meant that all the actions these individuals had taken were precisely to find a path into an impossible to enter Zone!\nThe moment Leonel had this thought, his heart stilled. He felt that he had regained his peace and that he could finally breathe steadily once more.\nEven he didn't realize it, but he felt so uncomfortable at the idea of some unknown person, thing or organization controlling his life that he nearly went mad for a moment.\nThis was the true Leoenl, a man who wanted to control everything in his palms. It had always shone through on the football field… And the day he chose to display it in the real world, it was unknown what kind of monster would be born.\nThe discomfort in Leonel's heart seemed to stack. First it was Lamorak, now it was this. At every turn, it seemed that someone wanted to play the strings of his life without his consent.\nLeonel's lip curled. It was an oddly cold smile, the kind he hadn't smiled in his entire life until this point. Seeing such a scene, Elys felt her soul crumbling.\nLuckily, the expression soon disappeared, replaced by Leonel's usual appearance. Handsome, bright and kind.\n\"Sorry about that, Elys. I was thinking about some matters… So why is it that we were recalled to Camelot with such an important thing happening at the border?\"\nElys patted her chest, wiping the sweat from her brow.\n'Is this the man I'm supposed to seduce...? How am I supposed to do that...?' She bit her cherry lips.\n\"... To answer your question, the matter of the Merlin Trials is too important. Even our Grand Knights can't guarantee maintaining order. The allure of such a treasured place is too much. Since we already lost the initiative, it's better that we retreat so we can be selective about who goes. That way, we can eliminate other variables...\"\nThat was how it was. Camelot wanted to control who could and couldn't enter.\nLeonel nodded slowly. 'I hope that you won't hold me back, Camelot. I would hate to become enemies with you all. But, if I have to choose between clearing the side missions and betraying you all, I will choose the latter...'\nThough it was necessary to have good relations with Camelot to complete the side quests aside from killing Modred, it wasn't necessary for the main quest. If Leonel had to choose, the choice was obvious. He just hoped Camelot wouldn't force his hand.",

      "content": "Elys ended up leaving without making any progress on her mission once again. However, Leonel didn't have the mind to bother with her thoughts. He felt a slight urgency in his heart. The instant she left, he buried his head into his training.\nHe hardly touched his bow. To him, his talent in the bow was so overwhelming that he didn't need to practice very much to bring it to a high level. Instead, he focused his entire being on his meditation and his spear.\nBy the time the news came down, he had almost gone through a hundred spears. But, compared to the over 2000 he had to master, he had hardly put a dent into his true goal. However, even still, he could feel his Spear Force being slowly refined over time.\nLeonel was still at the very first level of Spear Force. However, according to the dictionary his father left behind for him, there were separations between the kinds of Spear Force one comprehended.. The longer he could suppress his breakthrough while building and refinding his Spear Force, the greater benefits he would gain in the future.\nWith a hidden sharpness in his eyes, Leonel left the Segmented Cube.\n**\nThe Mage Academy was bustling, even more so than usual. The usually quite indoor garden around the Magic Art Tower was filled with the young and old. Everyone was waiting for a single announcement.\nAt that moment an old woman with a head of dry, greying hair sat silently atop a platform, quietly meditating as though the happenings of her surroundings had nothing to do with her.\nHowever, no one dared to snub this woman. Judging by her violet robes and the fiery red patterns that adorned them, this lady was a Two Star Fire Magus and very likely one of the Headmasters of the Mage Academy.\nSuddenly, this seemingly frail old lady opened her eyes.\nA resounding pressure singed with no small amount of heat suddenly pervaded the atmosphere. It felt as though all the moisture in the air was being sucked dry. Even the lush green grass beneath their feet looked as though they might wilt away at any time.\nWithout even having to say a word, silence took hold of the surroundings. The deterrence of such a magus, so infinitesmally close to the penultimate barrier, was too great. Who would dare to snub her?\nSurprisingly, without even bothering to waste any time, she began to speak of the topic at hand. There was no introduction, no flowery words, just a cold and emotionless arrow toward the heart of the matter.\n\"The Merlin Trial Gates will open in two months. Only those at and above the age of 16 will be allowed to enter.\n\"Rights for entry will be decided on your merits.\n\"Those between the ages of 16 and 20 must reach the Two Star Official Mage standard. Those between the ages of 21 and 30 must be Three Star Official Mages. Those between the ages of 31 and 50 must be One Star Magi. Those older than this must be Two Star Magi.\n\"Those that meet this first requirement will be allowed to enter a round of selections.\n\"There will be 50 spots for those within the first age bracket, 25 for those in the next, and in the oldest there will be just 10 spots\n\"Those of you who will be part of the quotas given to your families will not be included in this total.\n\"The selection will begin in an hour within the core city. If you've been found to be lying about your credentials, the punishment won't be light. So, think twice before you step through the teleportation formations. Prepare yourselves.\"\nThe Fire Magus was short and succinct. Those in the vicinity didn't even have the chance to process before her spiel was over.\nAn hour? There was no time to prepare? Some of them hardly had any idea what these Merlin Trials were, but now they were suddenly thrust into a competition for it?\nIt had to be known that not everyone was like Leonel. He had access to the Crown Prince and there was also Elys who seemed to have a special standing within the Mage Academy outside of being a lecturer.\nEven then, Leonel hardly knew much at all. If it wasn't for the fact he passed his Three Star Official Mage standardization test and was able to read the level nine information within the library, he would likely be even more clueless. Let alone these people who had even less access than he did.\nLeonel remained expressionless, his Three Star Official Mage robes reflecting a deep blue embroidered by bronze. He stepped into the teleportation formation toward the core of Camelot, his mind mentally prepared for anything.\nThe truth was that with his combat prowess, the 16 to 20 year old bracket was nothing more than a joke to him. His attending should be nothing more than a formality, but for some reason, he was still on his guard.\nLeonel's vision blurred. A moment later, he found himself in a large arena.\nBy all rights, such a large arena should have been bustling, filled from wall to wall with spectators. However, this wasn't the case at all. In fact… it was eerily silent.\nSeats that could seat upwards of 50 000 were covered in black sheets as though to divert one's attention from the fact they were empty.\nThe stands weren't completely with people, though. That said, it was certain that the youths and older mages that stood around Leonel wished that they had been. Reason being… the characters silently watching them from above were simply too awe inspiring. Their presence alone made their knees weak.\nThere were no more than a hundred of them, but each and every one seemed to carry the weight of the world on their shoulders.\nThere were the seven Supreme Magi, the Knights of the Round table, the General Stars… One after another, their standing and strength seemed to only grow.\nEven after all of that, there were still two individuals who made the mages around Leonel feel as though their hearts had stopped.\nThey both sat upon thrones, their strength so great that the air seemed to solidify around them.\nOne was a woman of exceptional looks. She had soft, wheat colored skin, flowing black hair and shimmering blue eyes. Her beauty was intoxicating to the point of drawing all who looked upon her into an illusion.\nShe wore a delicate blue dress and her neck and chest was wrapped by a soft white fur scarf. She embodied nobility to the greatest degree.\nThe second was a man. His blond hair was bright to the point of being blinding. His jaw was chiseled, his eyes deep and unfathomable, and his smile was charismatic and enchanting to the extreme.\nHis shoulders were broad and his presence was so tall that even his throne seemed too small for him.\nThere was no doubt that these two were the great Queen Guinevere and King Arthur.",

      "content": "At that moment, another teleportation array was lit. This time, a whole host of young and old knights walked out. It was very obvious that they came from the knight academy.\nIt wasn't long before they, too, were shocked by the lineup before them. It was clear that Camelot was taking this as seriously as they could.\nLeonel suddenly felt a pair of eyes on him. He casually turned his head to find a familiar large man.\nSir Lamorak looked down toward Leonel with placid eyes. It was impossible to tell what his emotions were at that moment. He seemed like a man who wouldn't blink even if a mountain came crashing down before him.\nLeonel met his gaze equally as expressionlessly.. Even when his strength was far beneath Lamorak's, he hadn't wavered. It could be said the only reason he had panicked back then was due to Magus Aliard's attack on his mind.\nThe current Leonel had long since learned how to defend his mind from such things. He no longer had to rely on the passive strength of his spirit, he could actively block such spells.\nIt could be said that Leonel was one of the only few who didn't feel such reverance in the presence of these individuals.\nIn truth, Leonel was born in an Empire as well. Though somewhat different from a Kingdom, the concept was similar enough. However, Earth's government was quite unique. While the sovereignty of the Emperor was important and many positions were hereditary, there was still the shadow of democracy.\nThis was why officials went by titles like Secretary Marquisette and Governor Duke. Each of these titles were combinations of democratically elected titles and hereditary ones.\nDue to this unique system, Leonel hadn't grown up in an environment where there was an emphasis on kneeling — and by extension, not kneeling.\nThat said, kneeling and not kneeling was one matter, while bowing to pressure was another. There was a difference between a person who knelt out of fear and one who knelt simply out of custom.\nLeonel's body might kneel, but that didn't mean his heart kneeled.\nFacing Lamorak's gaze, rather than shying away, Leonel felt his blood boil uncontrollably once again. It took all of his will power to not point a spear in the direction of that man.\nHe restrained his aura completely and eventually looked away from Lamorak. He felt that if he continued to look, he would lose all ability to control himself any longer.\nAt that moment, arcs of light splintered in the air, causing a mote of light to float before each participant. Soon, that light broke apart to reveal a wooden card with a number engraved onto it.\nLeonel's number was 321.\n\"Battles of the Mage and Knight Academies will go on simultaneously. Please split apart according to your numbers. You've been split into group of 100. Numbers 1 to 100 here…\"\nAnother Two Star Magus had taken over the preceedings. This time, he was a Two Star Earth Magus. Though there were some Two Star Magi taking part in this tournament, there were many with powerful family backers that had no need to do so.\nThis tournament was entirely made for those who wouldn't be receiving quotas from their families.\n\"Why're you staring daggers at a little boy, Lamorak? Oh?\"\nA man no shorter than Lamorak looked up in interest.\n\"Is that the boy who made you suffer a loss? I heard that you had to activate your Blazing Internal Strength to defeat him, aren't you embarrassed?\"\nThe man jeered Lamorak without restraint, laughing heartily. But, it was clear that this wasn't a disdainful taunt but rather simple banter between friends.\nLamorak grunted, but his eyes narrowed. He didn't like the look Leonel gave him at all. It wasn't particularly disrespectful, but the feeling was akin to being questioned by an ant. It made him feel uncomfortable.\n\"If he can fight you, this might be a bit too easy for the boy. He should steamroll the 21-30 bracket with absolute ease. He should be of some help during the Trials…\"\nSome of the knights here were old enough to have entered the Merlin Trial Gates the last time. Though 50 years was long to a mortal, to those who practice Internal Strength, living 150 years wasn't a problem.\nAs such, they were all well aware of just what kind of danger waited for them. Even though they were also much more powerful than they had been in the past, they still didn't feel an ounce of confidence. This was the kind of weight the Merlin Trials placed on the heart.\n\"Whether he'll gain a spot to enter is still a matter that needs to be decided.\"\n\"Hm?\" The knight by Lamorak's side frowned. \"Don't tell me you're targeting a little boy, Lamorak?\"\nBy the knight's tone, it was clear he was one part stunned and another part disappointed. Stunned because this wasn't the Lamorak he knew and disappointed because this wasn't the sort of disposition a knight should have.\n\"His origins are unknown. The only reason I allowed him to live was because Aliard stepped in and he was a Light Mage. But now, he's come out as an Earth Childe and washed his hands of all Holy Son related matters.\n\"There's no need to target him directly or even kill him for now. He can consider this payment for the service he's given to my Camelot up until now. But, allowing him to enter the Merlin Trials is impossible. He's an already difficult to control variable, letting him get more out of control is inadvisable.\"\nThe knight's frown deepened.\n\"In that case, why are you allowing him to participate at all?\"\n\"It's better that he loses justifiably so that he has less things to complain about. I don't care about face, but I can't tarnish the shield of the Knight of the Round Table.\"\n\"Are you joking, who are you going to find in his age group capable of defeating him? What are you playing at, Lamorak?\"\nLamorak snorted. \"Maybe those who have to take part in this selection cannot, but if I select a few talented 30 year olds from those families, it will still be possible.\"\n\"…\"\nThe more Lamorak spoke, the more uncomfortable the knight became. It was clear that Lamorak wasn't a scheming person. Would a scheming person so easily reveal their snake tail like this? Lamorak was only doing what he thought was best for Camelot.\nIn a lot of ways, he wasn't entirely wrong. There were too many questions about Leonel's identity and his abilities were even more questionable. Not killing him was already a sign of good will in Lamorak's opinion. However, allowing him to enter the Trial Gates was impossible.\nHowever, what happened next left Lamorak stunned.\n\"Um, excuse me. I shouldn't be in this group.\"\nUp to now, the atmosphere had been quite solemn and quiet. Due to some odd spell or maybe the black drapes placed over the empty seats, their voices didn't echo as one would expect. However, this left everyone feeling exceptionally hollow.\nMost of the voices had been coming from either the hundred or so elites observing from the stands, or the Two Star Earth Magus directing everything below. So… Leonel's voice stood out especially.\nThe Two Star Earth Magus frowned.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"This is the group for 21 to 30 year olds, correct?\" Leonel asked.\n\"Yes, that is correct. You're in the right place.\"\nLeonel frowned and shook his head. \"I'm only 18 years old this year, why would I be in this group? When did I say I was older than 20?\"\nThe arena was stunned silent.",

      "content": "The Earth Elemental Magus looked toward Leonel with shock.\nIn truth, he had heard of this Leonel before. No, it was more accurate to say that everyone had. And, due to his position, he was in a unique enough standing to know some special matters about Leonel as well.\nThe main point was that Leonel was recently given credit for killing two Demon Lords. This was a feat only the likes of the General Stars and the Two and Three Star Magi had. Yet, it was now in the hands of an immature boy.\nIt was already difficult enough to reconcile Leonel's talent with his age. But, if he was even younger than they all assumed… just what kind of ridiculous matter was this?\nNow that the Two Star Earth Magus thought about it, the registration of ages should have been done by the candidate themselves. After all, everyone here should have been registered with either the Knight Academy or the Mage Academy.\n.\nLeonel was in a bit of a special situation since he was an orphan. It seemed that as a result, other guessed his age for him?\n'That doesn't make any sense. Who would input an age for another without first asking? What would such a person gain?'\nThe Earth Magus suddenly felt a cold sweat falling from his back. He suddenly felt that this matter wasn't so simple, but he also didn't know just what he had suddenly appeared in the middle of.\n\"Boy, are you certain? The punishment for such an infraction isn't light.\"\nLeonel almost rolled his eyes. How could he not be certain about his own age?\nBut at the last minute, he held back. In this world, he had claimed to be an orphan. In an era like this one, it wasn't rare for orphans like him to be off on the estimation of their own ages by a year or two. If he seemed too certain of his own age, then it would only bring more questions about his identity forward.\nThinking to this point, Leonel decided to take a step back.\n\"I'm an orphan, I can only make estimations of my own age. But, I shouldn't be older than 20.\"\nHearing Leonel's response, the Earth Magus looked at him with an incredulous expression. This boy wasn't even sure but he was stirring up trouble.\nAt this point, he wanted to wring Leonel's neck. If you weren't certain, why did you have to bring me into this mess?\nLeonel only seemed to realize there was something wrong after reading the magus' expression. Now that he thought about it, it was indeed odd that his age had been decided without first consulting him. Was he being targeted?\n'If my age was decided for me, it's very likely that my number was decided along with the order of my battles.'\nThinking to this point, Leonel was enlightened. However, he was also inwardly puzzled.\nWith his strength, was there really anyone 30 or younger who could defeat him?\nHe didn't know, truthfully. He had a lot of knowledge about this world's magic system. But, as for the actual people that made up this world, he knew nothing. There very well could be for all he knew.\nStill, Leonel was confident.\nThat said… just because he was confident, didn't mean he'd allow others to ride on his head just because they felt he was an easy target.\n\"There's no need to drag this out, honored Magus. My knowledge is limited, but I do know that there exists an auxiliary spell that can test skeletal age. If I'm wrong, I'm willing to take on whatever punishment you have.\"\nThe Earth Magus' expression changed. The truth was that they were mostly were using the deterrence of Camelot to avoid such trouble. The [Age Detection] Mage Art was a Two Star Magus Art.\nNot only was it a high level spell, but since it served no other purpose, it was rare for Magi to learn it at all. It took years of meditation and calculations to learn just a single Two Star Magus Art. Why would anyone spend it on such a spell?\nIt could be said that those who did had done so for research purposes. Since [Age Detection] was a spell that relied on understanding the intricacies of the human body, comprehending it deepened one's understanding of healing magic.\nThis was all to say that those who could afford to waste time learning such a high level spell had exceptionally high standing within Camelot. In fact, they may be among those overwhelmingly influential individuals within the stands currently.\n\"This…\"\nThe Earth Magus turned a helpless eye toward the stands. Obviously, he didn't have the ability to cast [Age Detection].\nAt that moment, several cold gazes flashed within the 21-30 group. It was nearly imperceptible, but Leonel caught onto a few, causing him to sneer within his heart.\nThe longer he spent in this new world order, the more he learned about how useless ideas of law and justice were.\n\"Leonel, right? How about this. You're so powerful to begin with. Whether you participate in the lower or middle age bracket, the result will be the same. Why not just allow things to proceed as is?\"\nLeonel almost laughed in response.\n\"If that's the case and the result is the same regardless, why not just let me participate in the lower age bracket?\"\nThe Earth Magus was helpless. He was really hoping that Leonel would just take a step back. But, who knew where this child gained enough guts to be so contentious before the eyes of so many elites?\nIn the end, he could only look toward the stands for guidance.\nPope Margrave watched on with an amused light in his eyes. He found Leonel to be quite interesting. From what he knew, this child was quite clever. If he was doing this, it meant he realized he was likely being targeted and simply didn't care to continue being respectful.\nFinally, someone from above stepped forward. When Leonel saw who it was, his internal sneer only deepened.\n\"Three Star Official Magus Leonel is an orphan. His age is unknown. Judging by his level of strength and his accomplishments, it was decided that he would be allocated to the middle age bracket. This will mitigate the risk to other youths. In addition, it's believed that he has the strength necessary to protect himself.\"\nLeonel didn't have much of a reaction to these words.\n\"I would like to ask for my age to be confirmed, please.\"\nLamorak, who had obviously been the one to stand out, narrowed his gaze.\n\"The decision has been made.\"\n\"Is that so?\" Leonel asked. \"Are you certain?\"\nLamorak's aura suddenly became sharp.\n\"I can just cast it myself if it's really so troublesome.\" Leonel said as though not noticing Lamorak's expression.\nBefore anyone could react, a strong wind surged around Leonel.\nOne second… two… three..\nSHUUU!\nA light formed around Leonel's body as motes of light began to form from his body.\nThe lights grew in number and gathered. Soon, the spell dimmed, leaving the truth apparent for all to see.\n18 motes of light. The 19th barely formed before collapsing.\nNot only was it clear that Leonel was only 18 years old, it was obvious that he was only about half way to 19.\nLamorak's brow twitched.",

      "content": "\"It shouldn't be a problem now, right?\" Leonel said calmly. \"Please allocate me amongst the lower age bracket. There's no need to make wild guesses and conjectures any longer.\"\nThere seemed to be nothing wrong with Leonel's words, but they were laced with a hidden sarcasm that gave away his immaturity. It seemed that he wasn't very good at controlling his emotions, but this only made sense. He was still a teenage boy.\nHowever, none of that mattered. He was in the right. All of Lamorak's diligent planning went to waste. Never did he think that Leonel would actually have the ability to cast such a spell.\nIn the stands, Lionus smiled.\n.\n'This Leonel. It seems his true self is coming out more and more everyday. If Lamorak keeps pushing his buttons, he might not light the ultimate result.'\nWithout a choice, Leonel was allowed to enter the lower age bracket.\nFrom start to finish, the two with the highest authority — King Arthur and Queen Guinevere — didn't say a single word. They didn't step forward to help Lamorak, nor did they say anything in favor of Leonel. It seemed they were intent on being spectators to the end.\nAs rulers of a Kingdom, they had long since become accustomed to internal strife. Though it was a bit surprising that Leonel could cast a Two Star Magus Art, it wasn't as surprising as killing two Demon Lords. So in the end, it was still acceptable.\nLike this, Leonel steam rolled through the lower age bracket.\nHe didn't want to give Lamorak another excuse to target him, so since he was taking part in the Mage Academy selection, he used nothing but Mage Arts from start to finish, not pulling out his spear even once. In fact, he didn't need to use anything but Apprentice Arts.\nHis skill and battle sense caught the attention of many of the elites of Camelot. With each passing moment, he only impressed them more. Despite knowing that he was being watched by so many powerful beings, he was still able to maintain his calm, taking control of the battlefield with practiced ease.\nThe truth was that while they were impressed, Leonel was not. He could cast faster, his Spirit Pressure reserves were larger and his ability was created to be calculative. If he couldn't defeat them, he would be no more than a joke.\nLeonel knew that it would be almost impossible to find those with his level of strength at his age within the Third Dimension. Only those born in higher Dimensions would be able to match him.\nSoon, the result was obvious.\nLeonel proceeded not to lose a single battle and claim the first spot amongst the lower age bracket.\nWithin the middle age bracket, two young men stood side by side as they watched this with cold expressions.\nIn truth, if an [Age Detection] was cast on them, it would be found that they were in their mid-30's. They had already bended the rules to battle it out with Leonel and force him into a loss. But, they had never expected such a result.\nThe reason they could get away with such a thing was because they were merely the servants of the Lamorak Knightship. Since they were orphans, they could use the same excuse of not knowing their own age as well. In addition, since they were mages, they looked younger than they really were.\nThe truth was that though they had cold expressions, they were inwardly sighing breaths of relief. If they were caught, the one to suffer obviously wouldn't be Lamorak, but themselves. It could be said that Leonel had saved them as well, in a way…\nLeonel accepted his first place token and turned to leave, not sparing a glance toward Lamorak again. Whether this matter would end with just this was still up in the air.\nLamorak coldly watched as Leonel left.\nIt could be said that he lost all face today without anything to show for it. However, he didn't feel hatred toward Leonel.\nHe didn't do this because he hated Leonel. He simply didn't want Camelot to raise a snake in its grasses. Since this didn't work, he just had to think of something else.\n**\nLeonel retreated to his living quarters. However, there was no happiness on his face. Instead, his gaze was suffused with a cold light.\nAfter a moment, he laid down a few auxiliary protection and detection spells before entering the Segmented Cube's Lab Setting. There were still two months left until the leaving date. So, he had to be prepared.\nFirst he needed to complete his glove craft. After that, he would have to bite the bullet and make some utility treasures. Before, he didn't want to waste the precious ores he obtained from the Project Hunt island because they were simply too difficult to gather and he wanted to save them for his Divine Armor, but now he had no choice.\nLamorak seemed to believe that it would be a simple matter to deal with him. However, he had never been a pushover.\nAs Leonel began to meditate, the cold determination within him only grew.\nHe knew very well that at that moment, within the arena, the 100 or so elites of Camelot were discussing the placement of the youths the selection had just chosen. However, whether or not the position promised to him would be given to him was still up in the air.\nThere were three reasons Leonel chose to come back to Camelot despite knowing this would be a possibilty. After all, he had already been burned once by returning to the Royal Blue Fort. He wouldn't make the same mistake twice without reason.\nThe first reason was information. He simply didn't know enough about the Merlin Trials. Had he not returned, he would have no idea that the opening was still so many months away despite the appearance of that pillar of light.\nThe second reason was due to the side quests. Completing and clearing this Zone perfectly required Leonel to have a good relationship with Camelot. If he didn't, it would be several times more difficult. He didn't want to break off relations unless he absolutely had to.\nAnd, finally… it was the Knight Academy. Leonel had still not gotten the opportunity to read through the libraries of the knights. It was very possible that the information they held would help better his Dreamscape.\nThankfully, this selection provided a unique opportunity. The regulations of the academies had been relaxed so that students could improve in the time leading up to the opening.\nLeonel would take advantage of this time. He didn't know what trials lay ahead of him. For all he knew, his conjectures about the higher Dimensional Beings interfering with this Zone might all be wrong. But, the one thing he wouldn't be was unprepared.\nAs expected, just as Leonel was beginning to lay out his plans, the debate between the elites of Camelot had begun.",

      "content": "Swirls of golden lines followed the arc of Leonel's hand. His quill worked quickly. Sometimes it was forceful and strong, other times it was soft and delicate.\nThe blueprint of his craft grew more complex and intricate with each passing moment.\nThe more time Leonel spent diving into the world of Force Crafters, the more he realized just how deep such a world was.\nThe ultimate deciding factor of the complexity of a Craft was the number of parts it was constructed by. The number of parts that constructed a Craft could decide whether it was simple to make or if it would be the bane of its creator.\nOf course, there were always exceptions to the rules. It was possible for lower part Crafts to exceed higher part Crafts in difficulty of construction. For example, the most complex Craft Leonel had made to this point was his earth escape treasure.\n.\nThis earth escape treasure was only constructed of two parts. The outer band of the ring and the inner band. The outside was made of an Earth Elemental Vessel while the inner was made of a Water Elemental Vessel. It was precisely the difficulty of balancing these two Ores that made this treasure so difficult to construct.\nThis was all to say that the number of parts was a deciding factor, but not the only factor…\nUnfortunately, Leonel was facing trouble on both sides now. Not only was this Craft made of more parts than he had ever delt with before, but it also involved very volatile elements he was having trouble controlling.\nThe design he had settled on was a glove with three sleeves, one for his middle finger, one for his pointer figure and the last for his thumb. Since his pinky and ring fingers weren't strictly necessary for using a bow, he decided to save on materials.\nHowever, it was impossible to construct a sturdy enough glove with metal while also maintaining flexibility if he forged it into one part. As such, he needed to account for his finger and thumb joints.\nIn addition to this, Leonel wanted to use the properties of the Ores he chose to increase the strength of his arrows. As a result, he needed to form Force Pathways within the glove. This added a level of complexity that was beyond his current skill.\nHowever, Leonel had his Dream World. If he wasn't skilled enough now, he would practice and practice until he could accomplish his goal in real life.\n'This Craft will have a dual Wind and Lightning Elemental affinity.\n'I'll use the Fluttering Leaf Ore and Second Strike Lightning Elemental Ore…'\nIf others head Leonel's thoughts, they'd think he was insane.\nFluttering Leaf Ore was a Wind Elemental Vessel Ore best know for its light weight. Its a favorite for constructing flight type treasures, especially wings.\nSecond Strike Lightning Ore was a favorite of Lightning Mages. However, its main use was in increasing thinking speed and casting speed.\nUsing these two Ores in a Craft designed to strengthen arrows was practically unheard of.\nHowever, Leonel wasn't a fool. It was precisely because of these abilities that he wanted them.\nThough these Ores were known for these abilities, they were ultimately still Elemental Vessels. As parts of this Ore Family, their strength lied in storing their element.\nThe reason they were known best for their respective abilities was because they were great at providing a controlled output of their abilities.\nFlight required a controlled stream of wind. If wind was erratic in flight, the likelihood of death was simply too high.\nOn the other side of the coin, just how fragile was the nervous system? If a Lightning Ore could be relied upon to speed up one's thinking speed, it was as gentle as it came.\nThis is what made these two Leonel's ideal choice.\nHis hand was an important part of his body, especially his right hand which was dominant in the wielding of his spear. In addition, an arrow had a slim and delicate body in most cases. Whether it was for his arrow or for his hand, Leonel had to maximize safety and not strength.\nLeonel knew he could pick other Ores for a more exaggerated affect, but he was still too unskilled to guarantee their success. Maybe in the future he would look into such things, but for now… this would be his best shot!\n'I'll use Wind and Lightning Vein Ores as the foundation of the Force Pathways within the glove. However, they'll only play a supporting role, all of the Elemental Force will be provided by the Wind and Lightning Vessel Ores…\n'The final part will have 11 parts and be a Tier 9 Black Grade treasure…'\nLeonel continuously tweaked his final design. Any problems he found after simulating it in his Dream World would be fixed immediately.\nHe had no idea just how outstanding his feat was. Tier 9 Black Force Crafters were rarities on Fourth Dimensional Worlds. There were many such worlds without even a single one. Such worlds had to rely on trade with better off worlds or the rewards provided by higher Dimensional Worlds for clearing Zones.\nIt could be said that the current Leonel was an anomaly amongst anomalies. Even he, himself, had underestimated just how valuable his ability was to his career as a Force Crafter.\nHowever, while Leonel was advancing by leaps and bounds, he was still ignorant to too many things. His value as a Force Crafter alone was enough for those of Earth to elevate him to the level of a God.\nWell, that was just one possibility… the other possibility would be them locking him up to refine Crafts for them to the end of his days…\nLike this, weeks ticked by and the call Leonel was waiting for finally happened.\nOn that days, Leonel opened the door of his residence to find Lionus standing there waiting for him with a solemn expression.\n\"Leonel, I hope you've been well.\" Lionus forced a smile. \"My father seeks an audience with you.\"\nLeonel was stunned for a moment before his gaze narrowed. King Arthur wanted to see him?",

      "content": "A normal man wouldn't ever gain the right to enter a King's castle in his entire lifetime. But, there were always rare instances in which one would gain such an opportunity.\nIf you place yourself in one such person's shoes, it would be possible to imagine the surging emotions. The air of nobility that seemed to permeate every corner of the atmosphere bore down on the soul as though wanting to suppress any ego and pave the path for reverence and respect.\nLeonel had never been to the Capital City of Earth before. The best he had seen were images of the Grand Palace. He remembered feeling awe at the sight and currently, he felt no different.\nHe lacked such experiences in life, how could he not be surprised and even feel somewhat suppressed in such an atmosphere.\nThe noble air, the well trained guards, the lingering scent of superiority that hung in the air… It all weighed on his soul and it felt like the closer he got to the throne room, the greater the pressure grew.\nLeonel didn't even realize it, but he subconsciously took several steps back in his mind.. These weren't physical steps, but rather mental ones. It was like he was making concessions before the talks even began.\nLionus calmly observed Leonel from the side, but once again, didn't say much of anything. This time, it wasn't because he was testing Leonel, but rather because there were too many forces at play this time.\nIf Lionus had to choose a side to be on, he would choose his father ten out of ten times. He was the man he admired most in his life.\nHe also admired Leonel and even took him for a friend. But, it was simply impossible for Leonel's relationship with him to trump his relationship with his father.\n\"Enter.\"\nA dignified voice shook Leonel's heart and the doors to the throne room opened.\nLeonel had seen such a place already. The throne room of Pope Margrave wasn't much different aside from the fact this place was much less bright. However, Pope Margrave didn't give Leonel such an oppressive feeling.\nCompared to the laid back version of himself at the selection, King Arthur didn't carry the same carefree smile. Rather, his brows held a touch of dignity and his lips were pressed into a relaxed line that hid his emotions to perfection.\nLeonel approached the throne and knelt to one knee as a sign of respect. He had read about proper mannerisms within the libraries of both academies. Following them wasn't very difficult thanks to his pristine memory.\nHowever, due to this knowledge, Leonel also knew that he wasn't meant to rise until he gained King Arthur's acceptance. Leonel had thought he would hear something immediately, but he never expected for his show of respect to be greeted with a long drawn out silence.\n\"Three Star Official Magus Leonel. Born an orphan to the Fiore Barony. Recommended by Three Star Apprentice Knight Heckle.\"\nAnother long pause came after King Arthur said these things before he continued.\n\"Just these three. The information networks of Camelot have been working in full force for over a month, yet this is all they could find out.\n\"So, I will ask you this question once and once only.\n\"Who are you?\"\nThe more King Arthur spoke, rather than becoming more and more nervous, Leonel actually felt himself becoming eerily calm.\nThis feeling of helplessness had been gripping him a lot recently. Whether it was the battle at the fort, his run-in with Hacker Hutch, his battle with Lamorak, and now with this King Arthur who seemed intent on using his position of power to pressure Leonel into breaking down and telling the truth of his origins.\nHe found that with each time this happened, it felt worst than the last.\nNormally, it would make sense that he would get used to it. After someone lowered their head once, it became easier and easier to do it as time went on. Eventually, raising it back up again became an impossible task.\nBut, for whatever reason, this didn't happen to Leonel.\nKing Arthur didn't seem to notice anything. But, Lionus who had gained a deep understanding of Leonel over the past months suddenly felt that Leonel's aura was growing more and more stable.\nLionus' expression flickered for just a moment.\nLeonel remained silent. However, his lack of a response made King Arthur's gaze narrow.\nThe throne room didn't have many guards. There was simply no need. The most powerful warrior of Camelot was before them, so how many guards did he really need? But, it was safe to say that those who were here were the cream of the crop.\nSeeing Leonel's lack of a response, their auras, too, grew sharper.\nWhat happened next was completely unexpected.\nLeonel stood. Without word from King Arthur, on his own accord, he stood and brushed his knees as though there was dirt on them. In such a pristine and well maintained castle, where could there possibly be a speck of dust to find?\nAt that moment, Leonel suddenly realized that he didn't like kneeling.\n\"If His Majesty, King Arthur, has something to say, please be frank with me. My history is as you say, there's nothing out of place. There's nothing more I could say about it.\"\nThis was Camelot, not Earth. Did this King Arthur think he was a fool?\nCommoners didn't receive birth records, least of all orphans. Only nobles had the right to such a thing. On top of that, the Fiore Barony King Arthur mentioned was within the Yellow Mission Ring. Camelot's influence in that region was especially weak.\nAll this pressure King Arthur was placing on him, pretending as though he had already seen through Leonel, was all useless pretense. Leonel understood enough about Camelot after reading so many books that he could accurately guess that the likelihood he had been seen through was less than 7%. At most, they'd have suspicions.\nTherefore, reacting with righteous indignation now was the proper reaction.\nThat said… The current Leonel truly wasn't acting. He was pissed off. Maybe if it wasn't for his friendship with Lionus, he wouldn't mind exposing Queen Guinevere's extramarital affair right here and now.\nLeonel continued without waiting for an inevitably shocked reaction.\n\"If you would like to side with Sir Lamorak over me and rescind my right to enter the Merlin Trials, just say so.\"",

      "content": "Leonel raised his head to look toward King Arthur. His gaze was as calm as a lake, splitting the kingly aura that descended upon him in a steady stream.\nKing Arthur's aura became more and more stifling.\nIt wasn't just him. The guards along the walls of the throne room felt rage an indignation. Who was this boy to speak to their King in such a way?\nIt had to be remembered that though King Arthur was an orphan, he was still of noble birth. To the people of Camelot, his orphan status wasn't as important as his royal blood. From the very beginning, he was destined to be King.\nTo the subjects of Camelot, the difference in worth between Leonel and their King was obvious. How could they allow such an infringement on his dignity.\n.\nAt that moment, Arthur felt a hint of rage in his heart. When had he ever been disrespected in this way? Ever since he pulled the sword from the stone, his life had completely changed. He hadn't suffered a single setback.\nIn that journey up, his Knights were his brothers in arm. Lamorak and the others grew up by his side. He would have never made it here had he not relied on the judgment of his close friends. It was impossible for a King to make every decision himself and see through every mystery alone.\nEven if he appreciated Leonel's talent, Lamorak wasn't asking him to kill him, he was only asking him to rescind an entry right. Though this was still quite a major ask, it was still acceptable under the circumstances.\nIt was true that King Arthur had already decided to side with Lamorak. However, he had decided to question Leonel first.\nIn his mind, Leonel was just a teenage boy. Under the oppression of kingly might, any flaws he had would be obvious for all to see. However, what he had never expected was for Leonel to react like this.\nIt was true that Leonel had the right to feel indignant. A Major Opening of the Trials only happened once or twice a century. If he missed this opening, it would mean that he would never live up to his full potential.\nHowever, Camelot was in a precarious position right now. King Arthur would rather wrong an innocent than give way to a villain.\nWhether it was the internal strife with The Church, or the outside pressure of the Demon Army, both were issues that couldn't be looked down upon. If he also raised another tiger in the meantime, his Kingdom might truly crumble.\nHe already had his back pressed against a wall, yet now he was withstanding the verbal assault of a junior? How could he not be enraged.\nKing Arthur slowly regained his calm.\nThough his heart was billowing with anger, his face had hardly shown any ripples from start to finish. He was a King. In the end, he wouldn't lower himself to the level of a child.\n\"Three Star Official Mage Leonel, it has been decided by the Royal Court of Camelot that your rights for entry into the Merlin Trial Gates will be rescinded. You may leave.\"\nKing Arthur felt no need to explain himself. He could insist that Leonel's origins were too mysterious. He could say that Lamorak and he had fought side by side on many battlefields and he trusted the judgment of his brother. He could bring up any number of fallacious reasons he wanted.\nHowever, he didn't. He disdained to. What reason did he have to explain himself to someone beneath him? He was a King. The King of Camelot. His word was final.\nThat said… This King could have never expected Leonel's response.\n\"Mm.\"\nLeonel nodded as though this judgment had nothing to do with him. Then, he turned to leave without another word.\nHe had entered this castle with awe in his heart and he left with indifference hanging around him. He didn't even bother to bid farewell to Lionus.\nKing Arthur's gaze flashed with rage, but Leonel's footsteps didn't pause. It was complete disregard.\nIn the end, King Arthur chose not to move, even waving his guards who had half unsheathed their weapons off.\nAs Leonel walked out, he affirmed something in his heart.\nThere were many versions of King Arthur. There were stories that painted him as a heroic man without flaws who only fell due to the betrayal of those closest to him. However, there were others that painted him as a hero of an era with tragic flaws that drove those closest to him away.\nAfter this interaction, Leonel already knew which version of King Arthur he was dealing with.\nLong after Leonel left, King Arthur let out a sigh and shook his head. He ultimately wasn't an oppressive ruler. He had his own guilty conscience, but that didn't mean he would change his mind. He had already decided to side with Lamorak.\n\"Father, I think you've made the wrong decision.\"\nLionus, who hadn't felt it was right to follow Leonel, stayed behind. After a long while, he finally spoke these words.\n\"So this is why you decided to stay back? In recent days, it seems like you haven't wanted to spend any time with this father of yours at all.\"\nIf others knew this, they would be shocked. After all, Lionus had nothing but admiration for his father. Avoiding him didn't sound like something he would do.\n\"Father…\"\nKing Arthur waved his hand.\n\"Say no more, the decision has been made. The words a King speaks can't be so easily taken back.\n\"He is an Earth Mage, so ensure that this is properly accounted for. Ensure that he doesn't leave Camelot within the next year. After this, let him go and do as he pleases.\n\"If he moves to join Modred, kill him. If not, leave him be.\"\nKing Arthur gave this task not just to his son, but his guards as well. Wouldn't it be too much of a joke if Leonel was allowed to escape through the ground and leave toward the Trials even after he was banned from doing so?",

      "content": "Things progressed about how Leonel expected. When he returned to his living abode within the Mage Academy, he found that there were several spells deployed that he hadn't constructed himself.\nMany of them locked down space and prevented teleportation spells from activating. A few solidified the ground, impeding an Earth Mage's ability to use it to their benefit. And the majority were detection types, monitoring Leonel's every movement.\nLeonel's gaze flashed with rage. With a violent surge of his Spirit Pressure, the detection Mage Arts shattered like a rain of glass, crumbling beneath his might.\nIt was hardly a second later when Leonel heard a knock on his door. He opened it to find a familiar face on the other side.\n\"These detection arrays were put in place for a purpose. Your freedom is not your own for the next year, under the rules set by His Majesty, King Arthur.. If you destroy them again, it will be assumed that you are rebelling and you will be treated as such.\"\nLamorak spoke without emotion.\nThen, without waiting for Leonel to respond, he moved to the side and allowed a mage without affinity to enter Leonel abode as though it was his own.\nWith an apologetic look, the mage began to recast all of the detection Mage Arts Leonel had just shattered. It was only after 20 or so minutes that the mage finally finished and took his leave.\nAfter observing the whole process, Lamorak left the door ajar and took his leave.\nBANG!\nLeonel slammed the door shut with such force that it flew from its hinges.\nThe commotion wasn't small. With Leonel's strength, let alone the door, even the passageway it flew through was left with cracks that stretched along the wall.\nIn fact, the sound was so abrupt and violent that Lamorak felt his heart skip a beat for just a moment. He seemed to have completely forgotten that he was dealing with a child. Was he supposed to expect that Leonel wouldn't make any sort of commotion?\nLeonel didn't even bother to deal with his now doorless abode. What was the point? If he was being monitored so thoroughly, who cared if he had a door or not. Might as well let them deal with the damage he caused.\nLamorak's expression darkened.\n\"I advise you to control yourself.\"\n\"And I advise you to go fuck yourself.\"\nLeonel's temper flared. His eyes turned red and he bore down on Lamorak with a savage expression nearing madness.\nIt seemed that if Lamorak pushed him just one more step, he would flare up.\nBut this time, they weren't on the broad streets of Camelot. If they fought here, Leonel might not care about the damage he caused, but Lamorak didn't have such a luxury. And, Leonel was already too powerful to control with ease even for him.\nAs the clash between the two men continued, the crowd seemed to only be growing. The Mage Academy was a place of scholars to begin with.\nNormally, the Academy would be exceptionally quiet. Even when two or more mages were conversing, they would keep their voices to respectable levels. Something like two people having an argument and causing so much noise was exceedingly rare.\nLamorak saw the change to the situation and frowned. In the end, he backed down.\nAfter remembering that there was nothing Leonel could do but throw a tantrum, he regained his calm.\nHowever, this was still troublesome. It would be fine if he alone was losing face. But, if others knew that Leonel was being targeted after all the merits he had accomplished for Camelot, it would become a problem.\nWhat neither King Arthur or Lamorak took into consideration was Leonel's own response to everything.\nLamorak knew that if he didn't take a step back now and make some concession, Leonel might really disregard all consequences.\nIf he thought about it, wasn't this the normal way anyone would react? Their actions were no different from cutting off Leonel's future. Who wouldn't be completely infuriated now?\nLeonel snorted coldly.\nWith a grasping motion, he activated the One Star Official Art [Magic Touch] and flung the door closed behind him. Unfortunately, his forcefulness caused even more cracks to appear along the walls of the Mage Academy.\nThe spectators were stunned. They couldn't help but send hesitant glances toward Lamorak. How could they not recognize a lofty Knight of the Round Table? And, even if they didn't, Lamorak's oppressive aura was enough for them to know that he wasn't simple.\nWhen these people dispersed, news of what happened here began to disseminate. There was an outpouring of sympathy for Leonel. Many wondered just why it was the Royal Family would treat such a talent this way.\nMany of the mages and knights of Camelot came from normal families. This was especially so for mages. Magic talent usually appeared randomly except in cases where there was a lineage of exceptionally powerful magic users within a family.\nSo, seeing that Leonel was being suppressed in such a way, it left them feeling cold.\nOf course, while there were those who felt sympathy, there would always be those of opposing views.\nFor Leonel to gain a quota, he of course had to take a spot from others. There weren't just a few youths Leonel had beaten, and not just a few of them came from prominent families. It was just unfortunate that they weren't good enough to gain the quotas given to their families, so they could only fight it out with Leonel.\nLike this, Camelot split into two minds.\nIt was then that rumors of Leonel's questionable background came into being. As a Kingdom, how could Camelot not be capable of controlling narratives?\nSuddenly, Leonel's righteous indignation toward his treatment became the story of a man who couldn't control his emotions and couldn't repay kindness.\nLeonel was just a commoner. It was his good fortune that he was allowed to enter the Mage Academy.\nBy some twist, news of Lamorak 'sparing' Leonel's life and receiving the graciousness of Magus Aliard spread as well.\nLike this, what should have been a story of Leonel being done wrong by became a story Leonel's ungratefulness — a tale of an arrogant young man who let his success get to his head.\nHowever, the current Leonel didn't have a mind to pay to such things. The moment he slammed his door shut once more, his raging, savage expression became eerily calm. It was as though he was never enraged to begin with.\n'It's time to leave this place.'",

      "content": "Leonel wasn't a fool. He had already expected much of this to happen the moment he heard King Arthur's words. Everything he had done until now was just an act.\nIn truth, Leonel really was enraged. But, he wasn't the kind of person to blow up when he felt such a way. It was far more likely for him to grow calmer in such a situation, like a volcano waiting to erupt.\nHis interaction with James during their final meeting was a perfect representation of this. Back then, Leonel had been feeling all sorts of emotions swirling in his mind. Yet, the outward persona had been calm and placid, even while he was losing a friend of a lifetime. This was just the kind of person Leonel was.\nIn his brief interaction with Lamorak, he had accomplished two things.\n.\nFirst, he made Lamorak underestimate him. A person who can't control their emotions isn't a very dangerous person at all. By painting himself out to be an immature teenage boy, much of his threat had been lessened by several degrees.\nHowever, this was just a secondary matter to Leonel. It would at most give him a small advantage. His true plan lied within the shattering of the detection Arts.\nLeonel had no doubt that Lamorak would have a meeting with the mage who drew these Arts very soon. In fact, that meeting might be occurring at this very moment.\nAfter that meeting, Lamorak would find out that of the arrays Leonel destroyed, there were still about 5% of them remaining. This would make Lamorak lower his guard even more. But, they would have no idea that Leonel had already caused a flaw to occur within the arrays.\nLeonel walked to the center of his room and sat in meditation as though trying to calm himself. An hour later, he stood up and calmly left his room without a word.\nLeonel continued to walk as though nothing had happened. There was hardly anyone to find within the hallways of the Mage Academy and the few that did see him only sent various glances Leonel ignored.\nJust minutes later, Leonel had already left the ground of the Mage Academy and out the gates of? Camelot's walls toward the outer city.\nAt that moment, within the Mage Academy, a familiar mage was sitting in a room adjacent to Leonel's, diligently monitoring the arrays he had cast. Though he didn't really know what was going on, what he did know was that he wasn't in any position to reject. This was an order that came from King Arthur himself and was even being overseen by a Knight of the Round Table.\nHe might have been a Two Star Magus, but his standing was far beneath that of others. What he was the very best at where auxiliary type Arts. He was a great addition to any special team unit. Whether it was detection, deciphering, or obstruction, he was good at them all.\nEven still, this Magus didn't dare to be casual with his actions. Leonel was a person who had killed two Demon Lords. The number of individuals who had such a feat in Camelot didn't exceed a hundred by much. And, considering a population of tens of millions, it was clear that these individuals were elites amongst elites.\nHowever, even after many hours, the Magus didn't find anything wrong.\n'… This is going to be a long year…' The magus sighed.\nDetection Arts didn't exactly work like the cameras of earth. Rather, they locked onto an energy signature and fed back information about its location. By using many of them at once, it was possible to lock down a subject's position to the smallest detail.\nVisual Detection Arts were too easy to fool since they relied on an input of photons. Aura detection and locking Arts were far better for high level applications. They were much more difficult to fool and manipulate. Even if he as a Two Star Magus was given ample time to do so, his success would be uncertain.\nLike this, time continued to tick by.\nLeonel's aura didn't budge a single inch. After raging, it seemed that he had resigned himself to his fate and hadn't made any other movements.\nEvery so often, the magus would send another report to Lamorak, informing him that the situation was the same.\nIn truth, Lamorak was also personally monitoring Leonel, it was just that his approach was a bit different. He stalked the walkways of the Mage Academy, scanning through any potential escape routes periodically.\nAt that moment, he was in a state of meditation on the roof of the Mage Academy. To him, everything was within his grasp and everything was going well.\nHe didn't think there was anything wrong with Leonel's lack of movement. Helplessness was an expected emotion at this point.\nStill, something felt off about all of this to Lamorak. He just couldn't put his finger on it.\nHe thought back to everything he knew about Leonel.\nIn truth, it wasn't much. His interactions with Leonel had been few and far between. That said… With the exception of when Aliard cast a mental Art on Leonel, he had always been calm.\nBut this wasn't enough for Lamorak to be suspicious. He hardly knew Leonel. For all he knew, Leonel's calm disposition was nothing but a facade he put up.\n'Forget it, I will just go an check myself.'\nLamorak didn't feel that there was anything wrong. However, the unease in his heart wouldn't leave. He couldn't fathom how Leonel could ever leave with him monitoring the whole Academy, but as long as he laid eyes on Leonel, everything would be fine.\nLamorak appeared in the very same hallway, his expression darkening when he saw the cracks along the wall. The damage Leonel had caused was truly too much.\nWithout so much as knocking, he tried to swing Leonel's door open. Unfortunately, the door fell over, exposing… an empty room within.\nLamorak's expression twitched.\nAt that moment, blaring noises sounded from within Camelot. They were so loud that the earth seemed to shake beneath its pressure.\nLeonel, who had long left the range of Camelot looked back with an expressionless visage. Then, he turned around and continued to walk away as though none of it had anything to do with him.",

      "content": "\"FInd him! I don't care what you have to do!\"\nKing Arthur's voice boomed across Camelot's Castle. There was no doubt that it was completely rage fueled.\nEven when Leonel had completely disregarded him, he hadn't felt so enraged. But now, he felt as though his face was being slapped for all to see.\nTo him, it was perfectly fine if Leonel's future prospects were completely cut off. However, if Leonel were to leave the control of Camelot, every risk he had taken to now would be for naught.\nNow, not only had he offended maybe the greatest talent birthed since himself, he had also allowed this talent to vanish beneath his nose. No, it was even more shocking that this talent had the ability to disappear without any of them noticing in the first place.\nKing Arthur's rage lit a fire beneath the elites of Camelot. Everything had already been dancing on a blade's edge for so long, and now this had suddenly shoved them all into death's abyss..\nThe work force of Camelot split into three teams under Arthur's urging. One focused on finding traces of Leonel, another studied the room he had left, and the last controlled the narrative of the Capital, morphing the image of Leonel into one of an evil doer.\nHowever, the magi were completely stunned after deeply analyzing the changes to Leonel's abode. The more they looked, the denser their cold sweat became. Just what kind of man had they made an enemy out of?\nAfter a thorough investigation took place and King Arthur learned what happened, his fury could tear a hole in the skies.\nIt turned out that when Leonel shattered all of the detection arrays, he had taken the opportunity to infuse his aura into the walls.\nIn this case, aura was just the signature of his Spirit Pressure. Every mage had a unique signature that couldn't be duplicated except by extremely skilled auxiliary mages. However, the more powerful a Spirit Pressure, the more difficult it was to replicate. It was likely that there was no one in Camelot that could replicate Leonel's aura.\nTaking advantage of this, Leonel slowly controlled his Spirit Pressure to influence the newly constructed detection arrays after Lamorak confronted him for destroying them.\nThen, as though that wasn't enough, when Leonel slammed the door, he directly tampered with the last line of defense the magus had left. However, because he had 'missed' those arrays when he first destroyed the detection Arts, the magus and Lamorak both subconsciously believed that he wasn't skilled enough to see them, so they weren't tipped off by Leonel's actions.\nBut, none of this was what truly infuriated King Arthur.\nAccording to eye witness reports, Leonel left barely an hour after his initial interaction with Lamorak. He didn't wait until the dead of night, he didn't sneak out and slink around like a rat, he walked straight out the Mage Academy, through the gates of Camelot, and out without even quickening his steps.\nBlatant disregard. Blatant disrespect.\nIt was as though he was using his actions to show them just how little regard he had for them and their statuses.\nDue to the fact Camelot had initially tried to keep the matter regarding Leonel under wraps, those who knew the truth behind the matter were strikingly few. As a result, Leonel walked out like a free man without a single issue.\nNow that they were spreading the narrative and more and more people were finding out about it, it was already too late.\nLeonel could have used any number of techniques. He could have used the [Light Refraction] Magus Art to hide himself from the eyes of others. He could have escaped through the earth after leaving his the restrictive arrays of his abode. He could have even taken his time to set up a teleportation Art to leave the range of Camelot's influence.\nYet, he chose none of these paths. He chose the simplest and most disrespectful method he had available to him. Such a thing not only left the cheeks of Lamorak and King Arthur burning, but it fueled their hearts with rage.\nFor the first time, Lamorak felt something other than indifference when he thought of Leonel.\nInitially, to him, this was never about Leonel. This was only a simple risk assessment in his eyes.\nIn truth, many of the elites of Camelot had already concluded that Leonel was most likely the recipient of a Minor Opening of the Merlin Trials. This would perfectly explain his weird gadgets, his strength, and especially his spears.\nIt made sense that while their King Arthur gained the Sword Inheritance of Merlin, Leonel gained the Spear Inheritance.\nAfter thinking to this point, there was no reason for them to obstruct Leonel. Who would easily divulge the fact they had benefited from a Minor Opening? The fact so many held on tightly to this secret was why they knew so little about Minor Openings.\nHowever, back then, Lamorak had felt an itch in his heart despite thinking this made sense. He simply hadn't thought of it before.\nDue to this itch, he decided to implore King Arthur to place Leonel under house arrest.\nThough King Arthur was initially reluctant, after Lamorak described his worries and his opinions on Leonel's character, King Arthur ultimately decided to trust in his long time confidant.\nHowever, neither of them could have ever expected this result. And… It was now guaranteed that Leonel would never stand with Camelot again. In addition, if he truly was Merlin's chosen Spear Heir as many of them thought, then it wouldn't be long before his strength was beyond anything anyone but King Arthur and Modred could face…\nUnfortunately, time was running out. The opening of the Trial Gates was quickly approaching. Camelot simply didn't have the man power necessary to split for such a large search.\nThat said… everyone knew where Leonel's ultimate destination would land him.\nSuddenly, whether it was King Arthur, Lamorak, or the elite families of Camelot, they all had one more enemy outside of the Demons.",

      "content": "Days after Leonel's escape, Camelot finished its preparations.\nUnfortunately, due to the demons taking the initiative, Camelot had lost its footing around the Merlin Trial grounds. Without a choice, their only method of gaining entry was to fight to reclaim the land they had once lost.\nHowever, this matter wasn't so simple at all. Since Camelot knew what it had to do, how could Modred's army not also be aware? Long before Camelot began their march, waves of Demons had already begun to assault the Red and Yellow Rings of Camelot. Not only were there large numbers of humanoid demons, but the number of beast demons far outstripped even them, placing Camelot on the precipice of disaster.\nIn such a situation, the elites of Camelot were hardpressed to address everything. At this point, King Arthur no longer had the luxury to continue thinking about Leonel. Even without Leonel, it seemed that their Kingdom might be on the brink of collapse.\nThe truth was that Modred didn't have the ability to take down Camelot so easily. But, the root of the problem was that Camelot's elites all wanted to enter the Trial Gates.. And, even beyond that, from a certain angle, they had to.\nIf the Demon Elites entered, but Camelot could not, the disparity in their strengths would grow exponentially. Like this, Camelot's advantage of quality over quantity would disappear and their days would be numbered.\nHowever, it was impossible for all elites of Camelot to enter. If they did, who then would defend the common people? If they sacrificed the common man, so what if they came back more powerful? Would they even have a Kingdom to return to by then?\nThe Trials could take upwards of several years to complete. In such a situation, how could they possibly leave Camelot undefended for so long?\nSo… Some had to stay behind… but, the question was who?\nThe internal strife of Camelot only grew worse as a result. The battle for quotas reached a fever and those who were forced to stay behind no doubt had resentment buried deep within their hearts.\nHowever, the troubled times had not come to an end. Even after those who would stay and go were decided, those who would go didn't have an easy path waiting for them.\nNot only had the demons invaded the lands of? Camelot, forcing a portion to stay back and defend. But, there were also waves of demons obstructing their path forward.\nWith the best teleportation formations of Camelot only being able to take on ten people at once, at most, the only option was to march on foot. However, this left them vulnerable to bloody battle after bloody battle… By the time Camelot returned to the Border Region and approached the entrance, their numbers had been significantly waned and those who survived weren't in the greatest of condition…\n**\nThe worries of Camelot had nothing to do with Leonel. As a lone traveler, and with his overwhelming Internal Sight, Leonel hardly found trouble making his way back to the Border Region.\nLeonel chose to continue on foot rather than setting up a teleportation array. The accuracy of long range teleportation arrays was lacking unless two were connected over a distance. Obviously, Leonel didn't have the luxury of doing so or else what would be the point of using one at all?\nThere were short ranged Mage Arts among those that Leonel knew. However, not only did they consume a large amount of Spirit Pressure, even for a person like Leonel, but they also took a long time to cast. It took a normal Magus upwards of half a minute to cast one such Art. As for Leonel, it would take at least ten seconds.\nSuch Arts were best used by skilled mages who could dual cast — meaning preparing one Art while casting others to stall the enemy. Leonel had yet to need to do such a thing, especially since even with his Spirit Pressure, he could at most use such Arts about ten times in a single battle.\nLuckily, Leonel had already made his way through this region once before with Lionus. Though it was through teleportation stations, he still had a general idea about the direction. All he had to do was make it to the Border Region and he was certain he wouldn't miss that massive pillar of light.\nAs expected, before even leaving the Red Ring, Leonel could already see the pillar in the distance. In fact, even without using his eyes he could sense the massive Force fluctuations in the air. All he had to do was follow his senses toward the region of highest concentration.\n\"[Light Refraction].\"\nReaching this region, Leonel became more cautious.\n[Light Refraction] was only able to hide him from sight. It was a One Star Magus Light Art that refracted light around a subject. Since vision relied on the feedback loop of light, doing such a thing essentially made one invisible. The attack Arts of Light Magic might have been rare, but there were countless auxiliary Arts just like this.\nUnfortunately, it couldn't fool Internal Sight. But, for Leonel's current uses, it was perfect. Since the Border Region was exceptionally bland, [Light Refraction] worked particularly well. It might falter in regions with complex terrains, but the Border Region was just a vast expanse of grey, cracked lands. There was nothing to worry about here.\nLeonel rapidly closed the distance toward the pillar of light. The closer he got, the denser the population of demons became. It was obvious that Modred was casting a tighter and tighter net around the Trial Gates.\nEventually, the encirclement of Demons became so thick that Leonel no longer dared to move forward normally.\n\"[Earthen Road].\"\nLeonel sunk into the ground.\n[Earthen Road] was a Three Star Magus Art, it took a while for Leonel to cast. However, when he had time to prepare and could use it in conjunction with his earth escape treasure, he could travel through the ground as though walking on land.\nLeonel approached slowly, keeping his movements measured so as not to alert those above him. When he felt that he was about half a kilometer away from the location of the Merlin Trial Gates, he came to a stop.\nEven without extending his Internal Sight for fear about being noticed, he could still feel the dense demonic energies above him. It was no surprise that the elites of Modred's Demon Army were located above him at this very moment.\n'I doubt that Modred wants to wipe out Camelot now. It's likely she simply wants to weaken the force entering the Gates… It's seems she's quite a calculating person…'\nCamelot and Modred weren't the only two Leonel was worried about. He was also thinking about the 11 others who entered with him in addition to the potential interference of the higher Dimensional beings. Nothing about the next few years would be easy.\nLeonel covertly deployed a vision array. Though it was quite low level, this was actually a good thing. It was less likely for those powerful entities to detect such a low level spell. Since Leonel didn't dare to use his Internal Sight, he had to observe the situation some other way.\nFinally, Leonel buckled in. He knew that a major battle was about to be fought above him. In the meantime, he might as well put some finishing touches on his trump cards.\nHowever, Leonel never expected to find the scene he did within the Lab Setting of the Segmented Cube.",

His father's blueprints were always neatly arranged, the ores he used were always placed within the snowglobes after he was finished, and any scraps he had remaining had their own place as well.\nHowever… the Lab Setting was currently an absolute mess.\nLeonel's Craft table was overturned. His father's blueprints were scattered and by some miracle managed to remain undamaged. At the same time, the snowglobes which were once neatly arranged by category and type were sprawled all along the ground.\nThe two clashing entities continued without a care in the world as though not noticing Leonel's presence at all.\nLeonel's brow twitched several times..\n\"HEY!\"\nFinally unable to take it, he roared out in full force, fusing his Spirit Pressure into his voice.\nAs expected, it completely disrupted the rhythm of the two fighting streaks of light, causing them to fall over.\nAfter rebounding along the ground, the streak of silver shot toward Leonel, landing on his shoulder and bouncing up and down as though venting its frustration.\nBy that point, the identities of the two became obvious to Leonel. The silver streak was Leonel's Metal Spirit Familiar, Little Tolliver. As for the black streak… well…\nThe little mink landed on the ground, a dissatisfied expression on its little face as though it was unhappy with the sudden change of events.\nIt shook its little head, clearing its vision. When it saw Leonel, its eyes lit up with a hint of fondness.\nLeonel frowned. \"What's going on? Is it possible to overshoot the entry limit of a Zone?\"\nLeonel took out the dictionary. He was extremely confused at this moment.\nFirst, there was the fact the little mink exited the snowglobe without his permission. This was already questionable. But, beyond that, this Zone should have a limit of 12 individuals.\nAccording to what Leonel knew, the universe didn't treat the life of a beast or a human any differently. Both were instances of life. As such, a beast should count as an entry, no?\nNow that Leonel thought about it, shouldn't Little Tolly also count as an entry? Before, Leonel had ignored it because he assumed that since Tolly was his familiar, the both of them together counted as one entry. But, the appearance of the little mink made him rethink it.\nOriginally, he thought that maybe the suspended animation state the little mink had entered had allowed it to skirt the requirements of the Zone. But now, it had obviously, somehow, made its way out.\nWas it so easy to circumvent the rules of a Zone?\nUnfortunately, Leonel was thinking too simply. Spatial treasures capable of housing life were exceptionally rare to begin with. Someone like Leonel who had the Segmented Cube was so rare that one in a million didn't do it justice.\n'Easy' was only a relative term to Leonel himself. For others, accomplishing the same feat would be impossible. That said… that didn't mean there weren't consequences.\n[*Ping*]\n[Replying to Seed, it is possible to overshoot the entry limit of a Zone]\nLeonel blinked, his mind spinning. He froze a moment later, suddenly thinking of something and almost cursing the dictionary for being too blunt again.\n\"Is there a penalty for doing so?\"\n[*Ping*]\n[Yes.]\n\"What penalty…?\" Leonel's heart sank.\n[*Ping*]\n[The most frequent penalty is a time reduction.]\nLeonel nearly cursed. This damn little mink, it was alway causing him problems.\nThe original time limit of 10 years was already pushing it. Though, now that Leonel had given up on perfectly completing the Zone, it was still hard to say whether whatever reduction penalty he faced would allow him to clear the main quest.\nAccording to the dictionary, the main question was to 'save' King Arthur. With how complicated everything was becoming with Modred's actions, it was hard to tell exactly what that entailed. Leonel really couldn't afford a time reduction.\nLeonel sucked in a cold breath and calmed himself. Worrying now wouldn't be helpful to him.\n\"How much time do I have left after the reduction?\"\n[*Ping]\n[1 821 days remaining]\nLeonel winced. That was a little under five years. The little mink's appearance really almost halved the time he had left, how infuriating.\n\"Could it be that Little Tolly doesn't influence the time?\"\n[*Ping*]\n[Replying to Seed, Little Tolly's soul is fused with Seed's. As such, it does not count]\nLeonel could only let his frustration dissipate. There was already nothing he could do.\nSuddenly, arcs of lightning flashed within Leonel's Dreamscape causing his gaze to brighten.\n\"Two questions. How was the time reduction calculated? Secondly, if I meld my soul with the little mink, will the time penalty lessen?\"\n[*Ping*]\n[Replying to Seed, only five of the initial entries still remain alive. Due to this, the penalty for an additional entry was reduced greatly to just a half reduction]\nLeonel's eyes widened. There was such a thing? Seven of the twelve that entered died already? How?!\nLeonel felt a cold sweat mat his back. The dictionary's meaning was that the penalty would have been even worse if not for these deaths?\nHe had been so lost in his own grievances and improvements that he had forgotten that this was an SS-grade Zone. It should be at humanity's limits to clear a Zone like this. It couldn't be done casually.\nYet, because of Leonel's actions, the well-planned teams designated by the Slayer Legion became imbalanced. He likely ruined much of their plans.\nIn truth, it wasn't Leonel's fault. It was the fault of the Adurna family. Leonel was originally slotted as an entry from the very beginning thanks to his performance. But… something told Leonel that this sound logic wouldn't be accepted by the members of the rebels.\nNow that Leonel thought about it, he had also almost died. Had to not been for a stroke of fate, he too would be among the dead…\nThinking to this point, Leonel grew several levels more serious. In this place… His life was truly on the line. He couldn't take things lightly.\n[Yes, becoming one with the little mink would remove the penalty, though only by a margin]\nLeonel took a deep breath.\nHis plan was simple. The messenger mages of the frontlines had given Leonel no small amount of inspiration.\nUsually, those beast taming mages could only control weak willed animals with low intelligence such as the falcons and hawks they used to pass on messages.\nHowever, Leonel had several advantages over them. Firstly, his Spirit Pressure was several times more powerful. Secondly, he had several methods of lulling the little mink's mind into lowering its guard. He had to at least take the chance if possible.\nAll this said… Leonel couldn't have possibly guessed what would happened next.\nThe little mink blinked out and into existence. When it reappeared, it had already sat on Leonel's opposite shoulder, standing in opposition to Little Tolly.\nAt first, Leonel had his guard up. But this, his strong Internal Sight suddenly felt something stretch out from the little mink to him, tying them together.\nLeonel's expression changed. He felt a subtle link between himself and the little mink. But, it wasn't through their souls but rather…?\nLeonel took a step, his face twitching.\n'Our shadows are connected…?'\nLeonel subconsciously felt that this connection was no weaker than a soul connection. In some ways, it might have been even deeper.",

      "content": "\"What… What just happened?\"\n[*Ping*]\n[The little mink has used its Shadow World ability to tie Seed's shadow to its own]\n\"What the hell does that mean?\"\nLeonel didn't understand. A shadow was just a body blocking light from reaching the ground. It shouldn't have been any more or less. How do you tie two shadows together? And worst yet, he didn't even have the means to resist. What if this was detrimental to him?\n[*Ping*]\n[Seed can consider this a magic system unique to the little mink's ability]\nLeonel's eyes widened before he came to a certain understanding. It turned out that the universe could introduce new magic systems not only through Mythological Zones, but also through abilities!\n\"Then what does the melding of our shadows mean?\"\n[*Ping*]\n.\n[To the little mink, shadows function similarly to souls. Connecting you shadows is similar to the little mink taking you as a Familiar]\nLeonel's lip twitched. Wasn't is supposed to be the other way around? He was the one getting treated like a pet now?\nHe really didn't know how he was supposed to react to such a thing.\nLeonel sighed and shook his head.\n\"[Soul Reader].\"\n[Soul Reader] was a One Star Magus Art. It wasn't as exaggerated as allowing one to read someone's mind, but it could be used against low intelligent creatures to understand the general gist of their emotions.\nWhen Leonel cast this on the little mink, he felt waves of fondness and gratitude infilitrate his mind.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow.\n'Oh… This little guy must think I was the one who saved it from that monocle wearing bastard…'\nLeonel scratched his nose, feeling a little bit like he was taking advantage of a child.\nThough he had indeed saved the little mink back then, that was for his own purposes. He would have felt more comfortable just killing it, but his heart had softened at the last moment.\nIn addition, the only reason he saved the little mink was to stop Simeon from using his ability to control it. That would have put him in a bad situation… So it could be said that he had done so for his own selfish reasons.\nLeonel shook his head and smiled. He guessed this was just fate.\nIf he could take the little mink as a partner, even if it meant taking on a time reduction penalty, it was worth it. After all, this little guy was extremely powerful. If it wasn't so immature and infantile in its thinking, it would have played Simeon to death. Unfortunately, it was still young and inexperienced.\nLeonel scratched its little head.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nThe little mink rubbed its head against Leonel's fingers.\n\"Alright, I'll call you Blackstar. How about it?\"\n\"Yip! Yip! Yip!\"\nThe little mink seemed to like its new name.\n*Blop* *Boop*\nOn Leonel's opposite shoulder, Little Tolly seemed a bit disgruntled. Clearly, it didn't like Little Blackstar too much.\n\"Alright, alright.\"\nLeonel let Little Tolly rush around his fingers and wrist. After the little guy began to evolve, it learned to control its corrosive property a bit more. As long as it wasn't activated, there was nothing to worry about.\nWith Leonel help, it had already reached the TIer 7 Black Grade of evolution. Who knows, maybe if its control increased, Leonel could use it to take this damned wrist watch off without taking his hand with it.\nWatching his two Familiars glaring at one another, Leonel felt his mood lighten. It had been a long time since he could genuinely smile. It felt like ever since he sent Aina away and fell out with James, everything had only been getting worse and worse for him.\n'I don't know enough about this little guy's ability to make proper use of him…'\nAfter smiling for a moment, Leonel thought of a problem. The little mink's greatest weakness was its poor battle sense. Leonel could technically make up for that, but the prerequisite was understanding the little guy. If he couldn't… then he would be limiting the little guy too much.\nLeonel tried to ask the dictionary, but unfortunately, it could only give him vague hints. Even the dictionary didn't have the ability to give him too many details. There were simply too many variables when it came to abilities.\n'Shadow World… Shadow World… Forget it, I'll just slowly figure everything out…'\nLeonel planned to use [Soul Reader] consistently in the future. As long as he paid more attention to Little Blackstar while he used his abilities, it would be easier to gain a grasp on how Shadow World worked.\nJust when Leonel had made this decision, the ground began to shake. Due to the fact he was underground, it felt as though the rumbling was within his chest, even to the point his teeth began to clatter.\nLeonel's gaze narrowed, turning his attention to the video capturing array he left on the surface.\nThe scene he saw was about what he expected.\nOn one side, a beaten and haggard group of human knights and mages stood. It was clear that fatigue was written all over their faces. However, their gazes remained sharp almost like half unsheathed blades.\nIn the midst of of these humans, there was a man clad in white armor. The spaulders were shaped into roaring white tigers, giving him a valiant and partly barbaric appearance. Leonel immediately recognized this man as King Arthur.\nOn the other side, there was a hoard of demons. They weren't nearly as organized, but their eyes reddened with fighting intent. Some of them with part bestial bodies let their tongues hang from their mouths, not caring as thick, grotesque globs of saliva dripped down.\nIn the midst of these demons, Leonel's eyes locked onto a woman.\nIn truth, this woman should have taken his breath away. She had a valiant air that reminded him of Aina, but she had a maturity Aina was still lacking. Her body seemed carved by the hands of a god, perfectly porportioned and without an inch out of place. The way her black armor flowed into a skirt that revealed two long, pale legs could grip the gaze of all those who saw her.\nHowever, Leonel hardly spared this woman a glance, because his eyes landed on something else directly afterward…\nIt was yet another woman. She too was beautiful, though somewhat lacking in comparison to the woman donning black armor. She wore fiery red armor and had a cap of red feathers attached to her shoulders.\nStill, it wasn't her looks that caught Leonel's attention. Gazing upon her, his eyes couldn't help but narrow…\n'Supreme Monet…'",

      "content": "Leonel sucked in a cold breath.\nIf Monet had managed to get close to Modred, this was either a good thing or a bad thing. Something like betraying Leonel and siding with the demons was impossible. After all, doing so would put Monet's life on the line as well. Unless… unless her Zone detection treasure made a mistake.\nLeonel had already learned the hard way that such treasures tended to be unreliable. Had it not been for his luck until now, he probably would have fallen in a Zone already simply due to lack of information.\nIf Modred's detection treasure informed her that the main quest was to save King Arthur, this could be a good thing. However, if for whatever reason it was off in its assessment, then Monet might become an enemy Leonel had to fight against.\n'… This might be a problem…'\nLeonel looked through the rest of the opposing armies.. He immediately found the remaining three who had entered with him.\n'Big Buddha… Little Nana… Violet Rain…?'\nLeonel was stunned. Could it be that adorable little girl was all alone now? What happened to the rest of the Adurna family? Did they all really die?\nLeonel knew that there was an escape ticket to leave Zones. However, he couldn't imagine that a family would leave their little sister behind like this. There had to be another explanation.\nOn the other side, the fact that only Monet, BIg Buddha and Violet Rain stood on the side of the demons likely meant the others were dead, including Badger's partner, Mayfly.\nLeonel didn't know how to feel about this. Though he had no love lost to the Slayer Legion, Mayfly had been among the two who came to save him. Though he didn't really need such help at that time, sometimes the thought was as important as the action.\nThe two armies faced each other, the tension towering into the air.\nKing Arthur sat upon his horse with a stoic expression. A strong dignity scrunched his brows.\nThe version of him now was completely unlike the enraged monarch he had been before. Rather, he had once more regained his bearing, facing off the enemies of humanity with a valiant momentum.\nOn the opposite side, Modred stood. Unlike King Arthur, her demeanor didn't hold any dignity. This wasn't to say that her momentum lost out, but rather than her method of showing her majesty was much different.\nWhile King Arthur was incomparably serious, surrounded by six of his originally twelve Knights, she was completely indifferent. It was as though she didn't put Camelot in her eyes at all.\n\"DRAW!\"\nKing Arthur's mighty roar was met by the sounds of unsheathing blades. Their movements were as one, causing the sharp, metallic resonance to fuse into one, piercing toward the rumbling, black clouds above.\nAt that moment, the pillar of light to Modred's back suddenly shuddered, splitting in two and slowly opening.\nModred's indifferent expression curled into a smile. It carried a hint of seduction and teasing. It was the kind of expression that a daughter should never give a father. But, those who were aware of the relationship between Modred and King Arthur were few and far between.\n\"There's no need to fight, now is there? We can simply enter together and leave the rest up to fate.\"\nModred's delicate voice should have made them sigh a breath of relief, but it instead made their rage bubble up.\nNo need to fight? They had known nothing but battle for nearly the whole of this last month. Now, they finally met the enemy that was the cause of all their frustrations but she actually said that there was no need to fight?!\nIt was as though they had met the enemy of a lifetime, but could do nothing but watch as they basked in their own success. The worst part was that they knew they had no choice but to play along with this enemy's wishes.\nKing Arthur's jaw set, but he didn't flare up. His cold, blue eyes flashed with a hint of killing intent.\nTheir army had been worn down during this travel. Entering the Gates in this condition would no doubt put them at a great disadvantage. Modred definitely knew this. There was no need for her to put her own people at risk. It was more important to enter.\nWithout another word, she turned, leading the Demons into the wide expanse. She didn't even protect her back. This not only showed her disregard for Camelot, but also how little she cared about the lives of the demons who served her.\nWhile they had to worry about the emotions of humans and protecting their lives, Modred didn't have to care for any of this.\nKing Arthur calmed the rage in his heart. They had already sacrificed so much to get here. THey couldn't afford to sacrifice any more.\nHe swept a glance over the would-be battlefield, but he didn't find a hint of Leonel's shadow. This realization caused him to frown.\nHe waved a hand. \"Gawain, stay back and guard the Gate. Only enter at the last moment and make sure you're the last to do so.\"\nOne of the knights by Leonel's side nodded. He was King Arthur's nephew, a Knight of the Round Table, Sir Gawain.\nThe relations between the knights were quite complex. Gawain was Lancelot's best friend, however Lancelot wasn't present. Due to the complexities of Arthur and Lancelot's relationship, Arthur had no choice but to walk a fine line. As such, his compromise was forcing Lancelot to remain back and defend while Gawain was allowed to come.\nUnfortunately for Arthur, Leonel had no intention of being left out at the last moment. The moment Modred turned toward the Gate, he had already begun moving through the ground. In this situation, he couldn't afford to continue being cautious.\nMaybe it was a bit expected, then, that Modred's steps would pause just when she was about to enter the Gates.\n\"Hm?\"\nHer delicate brows arched, seemingly sensing something.\nHer gaze swept forward, landing on the precise piece of land Leonel was running beneath.\nLeonel's eyes narrowed when he sensed he had been locked onto, but he didn't change his direction nor slow his pace. In fact, he kept running beneath the ground. He was too far beneath the ground to be easily dealt with. Only an Earth Magus could disrupt him greatly.\nModred's eyes twinkled as though she had found an interesting toy to play with. She could tell that Leonel had sensed her, yet he actually continued undaunted.\nBy now, Modred wasn't the only one who noticed the oddity.\nThose of Camelot immediately knew who it was. They all knew Leonel was an Earth Mage, who else could it be but him?\nModred chuckled and didn't mind it anymore, stepping into the gate.\nThe moment she vanished, Leonel had already cut deep into the demon army, shuttling through beneath their feet with the greatest speed he could muster.\nKing Arthur's jaw clenched. He could have never imagined that Leonel would be so brazen. But if he thought about it, what had Leonel done to now that wasn't a slap to his face?\n\"Forward!\"\nHe already knew it was too late to stop Leonel, but there would be plenty of chances to get rid of this potential trouble during the trials as long as they were anything like the last time he entered.\nToward such an attitude, Leonel could only shake his head. He really didn't want to save such a man, but he had no choice if he wanted to keep his own life.\nShaking his head, Leonel launched himself out of the ground, not minding that he appeared in the midst of several Demons. His speed was too fast. Now that he wasn't a member of Camelot anymore, what could restrict him from using his Light Elemental Force?\nIn the blink of an eye, a streak of blinding gold appeared beneath Leonel's feet and he entered the gate.",

      "content": "Leonel didn't find what he expected to find on the other side.\nFrom the reactions of the demon and human armies, it seemed that they would have another chance to deal with him within the Trial. So, he had been fully prepared for an all out battle the moment he stepped in.\nHowever, this wasn't what he found at all.\nAt the moment, he stood on a dull grey platform. It was a meter by meter in length and width. There was nothing particularly special about it at all except for the fact… it hung mid-air amidst an endless darkness.\nLeonel stretched out his senses, but he couldn't sense a ceiling nor a bottom, it was as though he was floating in the depths of space.\nIt almost felt like a dream. But, if it really was so, Little Tolly wouldn't still be happily squirming around his fingers, nor would Little Blackstar be lazily lying around his neck. Since both of them were by his side, it was clear that Leonel's true body had entered whatever space this was — at least upon his initial assessment.\nJust when Leonel was feeling confused, an aged voice suddenly rang around him. Due to the surroundings, it was difficult for Leonel to tell whether it was sounding directly in his head, or if it was being transmitted to him some other way. But, leonel didn't linger on this question for too long as the words the voice said caught his full attention.\n<Analysis Complete>\n<Please choose: >\nLeonel saw several orbs of light manifest before him. Each of them housed a different object.\nThere was a sword, a bow, a spear, and a wand. Outside of these four, there were other more unconventional weapons. Leonel could see maces, staffs, and battle axes. But, none were as large as the first four Leonel noticed.\n'I'm supposed to choose one of these…?'\nLeonel didn't really need to think much.\nHe had never touched a sword before and there was no real point in learning now.\nThe spear was even easier to ignore. Though this might sound odd, after a moment of thought, it became obvious why. Everything in this Trial was tied to the Third Dimension, it might very well become obsolete at higher realms unless Leonel put in the effort to evolve it.\nThis Zone represented an opportunity. All of the Magic Systems here had ample potential for growth if taken to the extreme. However, why would Leonel need to do such a thing for the spear since he already had the Spear Domain ring on his finger?\nThe last two were a bit more difficult to choose between.\nLeonel was very interested in his world's Mage Art system. It had been very helpful to him to this point and he could see it being useful at least into the immediate future.\nAt the same time, Leonel had long since realized that his talent in the bow was overwhelming. Even though he had awakened his Spear Domain Lineage Factor, he still felt that his talent for marksmanship overshadowed it by a large margin.\nIn the end, Leonel decided on the bow. It came down to a simple risk assessment. He had a legacy related to the Bowman King Inheritance in his hands. From Leonel's understanding, this was related to a Minor Opening.\nElys had said that benefiting from a Minor Opening could give some advantages during a Major Opening. In that case, there really was only one option. Leonel had enough to worry about. It was in his best interest that he made everything that he could control as easy as possible.\nLeonel subconsciously took the deep black bow from his spatial bracelet. It alone stood as tall as anyone of his spears.\nThe moment Leonel acted, the sphere of light housing a bow reacted immediately, shooting toward him like a falling star and fusing into him and the black bow.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow.\nThere was now a small, barely perceptible, golden brand on the back of his hand. It looked especially faded as though it had been drawn on then washed away. Leonel subconsciously felt that this tattoo of sorts would become very important very soon.\nLeonel didn't get much of a chance to observe the tattoo for long because the situation around him changed completely in the next instant.\nHis grey platform shot forward as though trying to fling him off. Luckily, some unknown force kept his feet planted, or else he really would have been in a sorry state.\nLeonel's vision blurred and his mind spun. Not knowing whether he was moving up, down, left or right left him completely disoriented. If it wasn't for a vague forward trajectory, he wouldn't have any idea where he was headed.\nSuddenly, the platform came to a grinding halt.\nLeonel's eyes squinted and he shook his head.\nAt that moment, he felt several auras lock onto him, many of which were filled with killing intent.\n'Hm?'\nLeonel's vision slowly cleared, allowing him to look around for the first time. What he saw left him smiling a bit bitterly.\nAll around him, platforms just like his own hung in the vast expanse of darkness. There were about 200 of them in total, half of which were taken by humans and another half of which were taken up by demons.\nMany of the strings of killing intent came from the demons that floated around him, but that was simply due to their hatred of humans. The more pointed streams of killing intent actually came from the humans.\nLeonel could feel King Arthur's gaze sweep over him. But, there wasn't just him. Supreme Monet was seemingly stunned and enraged to see him here.\nSo many of her men had died in this place, yet Leonel had actually managed to survive. Whether it made sense or not, she subconsciously placed blame on Leonel for such a thing. Of course, she also hated the Adurna family for sticking their nose in a place it wasn't meant to be. However, some of this hatred was unwittingly directed toward Leonel as well.\nAfter ignoring the glances and regaining an air of calm, Leonel realized that everyone also held a weapon. But, their weapons were strikingly different from his own. Compared to the powerful bow in his hand, theirs were mostly the most simple and crude weapons imaginable. They even reminded Leonel of the primitive man's spear.\nAs Leonel was noticing their weapons, they too noticed his.\n'Minor Opening…!'\nThey all understood immediately and the light of greed lit in many of their eyes.\nAmong those who were here, there were a striking minority who had such a luxury.\nThe first was King Arthur. He wielded his sword with a valiant air. There was no doubt that this sword was the legendary Excalibur.\nThe next was Modred. She held a wand as black as ink. It held an air of majesty that made Leonel's heart tremble. For some reason, he could see the faint image of an ink black qilin looming behind her.\nSurprisingly, the third was actually Peirce! This was likely a surprise even to King Arthur and his men. Peirce's long twin swords gently touched the ground, being held lightly in his palms.\nThe fourth was Pope Margrave! He held a radiant cross to his chest as though sinking deep into a perpetual prayer. The light around him seemed to illuminate even the endless darkness.\nBefore Leonel could observe the others, the situation changed once again.\n<First Trial Begin!>\nThe world warped. A single massive grey platform over 20 meters in width and length appeared.\nAt that moment, a demon's own grey platform shot forward, connecting to the massive platform outside of his control.\nBefore Leonel could understand what was happening, a creature began to manifest…",

      "content": "Soon, an odd metallic beast came into being.\nAt first it seemed that its metal coverings were just bits of oddly placed armor. However, when it began to stretch, it became obvious from its movement that these metallic shields were a part of its body.\nIt stood on four limbs, looking somewhat like a large silver tiger. However, its tail was exceptionally long, being formed of shield-like scales that reminded one of a scorpion without the final pincer. This tail was almost like a whip, being double the length of the creature's body.\nIt had two sharp tusks that left its mouth partially open. At the same time, it only had a single vertical eye that split its forehead in two.\nAt this time, the beast was surrounded by a shield. Though the voice had said that the first trial had begun, a step had to be completed first.\nThe demon chosen to be first stood on its platform, facing the creature. However, he had yet to step onto the main platform just yet. This wasn't because he was cowering in fear, but rather because odd patterns had begun to form before him.\nHe wasn't the only one who could see these patterns. It was another choice. Except this time, everyone would bear witness to it together.\nSoon, the patterns coalesced, forming a clear image. What was left were numerous spheres connected by branching lasers.\nMost of these spheres were dim. However, at the very bottom, there was one that was slightly brighter.\nLeonel's mind immediately realized what this was.\n'Skill tree?'\nAt first, Leonel thought his idea was silly. But, the more he thought about it, the more he realized that this was the only explanation.\nThe demon's choice of weapon was a mace. The only bright sphere of the skill tree also projected the image of a mace except this mace was in movement, displaying what Leonel assumed was a technique.\nUnlike Leonel who was in the dark, it seemed the demon wasn't surprised by the appearance of this skill tree. His eyes looked toward the top of the skill tree with a fiery light, but he was well aware he wasn't in position to touch those legendary abilities just yet.\nWith a hint of reluctance, he reached for the only slightly bright sphere.\n<Basic Skill 'Single-handed Bash' Chosen>\n<Skill Points Remaining: 0>\n<Trial Commencing>\nThe demon brandished his mace and licked his lips.\nThe shield vanished the moment he stepped onto the main platform. In that instant, the lazily stretching beast suddenly stopped, a faint growl trembling its tusks.\nThe battle lasted longer than Leonel thought it would. He had originally assumed that it would be a matter of a few moves, but the longer he observed, the more shocked and apprehensive he became.\nThe reason for his shock wasn't because the beast was too powerful or that the demon was too weak, or even the vice versa of either. The reason he was so shocked was because aside from 'Single-handed Bash', the demon didn't use any other moves.\nNo, that wasn't exactly right. It wasn't that he didn't use any other moves but rather that… He couldn't!\nWhen Leonel reached this point in his thoughts, he sucked in a cold breath and suddenly understood how this trial would work. There were likely formless laws in this place that made it impossible to use skills that weren't unlocked through the skill tree.\nLeonel was stunned. For the first time, he somewhat regretted choosing the bow. If things were really like this, he was in a bad position.\nIt wasn't a simple matter of attack patterns being restricted. The demon could only move with simple steps. In addition, his skill seemed to have a cool down as though this was really a game. This sort of situation caused him to only be able to attack once every three seconds.\nThis meant that every aspect of battle was controlled, whether it was movement, attack or defense! As a bowman, Leonel was particularly restricted. It would make the future several levels more troublesome.\nThis wasn't the only problem either. Leonel had hoped to use his Mage Arts to make up for his lack of arrows. But, if he could only use skills on his skill tree… where would he get arrows from?!\nLeonel was certain that if this place could restrict even attack patterns, there was no way it would allow him to produce his own arrows.\n'Shit…' Leonel clenched his jaw.\nFinally, after a long drawn out battle, the sound of shattering glass resounded. An invisible shield around the metallic beast broke, causing it to shut down.\nBeaten and haggard, the demon's eyes flashed brilliantly. Though fatigued, he had done it, he had passed the first trial.\n<First Trial Complete>\n<Time Taken: 2:39:02>\n<Trial Grade: C>\n<Skill Points Rewarded: 2>\n<Special Reward: None>\nThe skill tree appeared before the demon man once again. This time, a new row had lit up. But, with his skill points, he could at most choose two. In addition, there were some skills that needed more than just a single point to awaken.\nFor now, though, all the skills the demon man could awaken were Basic and as such only needed one.\nThe trouble was deciding a path to go down. Should he try to diversify or try to specialize in one branch until he could awaken ranked skills?\nEventually, the demon made his choice.\n<Basic Skill 'Two-handed Bash' Chosen>\n<Basic Skill 'Charged Bash' Chosen>\n<Skill Points Remaining: 0>\n<C-grade Recovery Rewarded>\nThe demon's platform shot back. Once it was within the group of waiting trial takers, a soothing light descended upon him, slowly washing away his fatigue.\nAt that moment, everyone grew tense once more. For a Demon Lord with such a formitable body to struggle so much, everyone was hoping they'd have more time to observe, even Leonel.\nUnfortunately… reality was cruel.\nLeonel felt his platform tremble and then shoot forward.. It seemed he had won a lottery he had wanted no parts of.",

      "content": "Leonel settled his breathing. Since he had to go, he would go.\nNumerous gazes flooded toward Leonel. Compared to the interest the previous candidate had, the curiosity toward Leonel was several levels greater. This could only be expected, after all, Leonel was the beneficiary of a Minor Opening. He was definitely among those who would last to the very end of these Trials.\nAt the same time, he was a target. As for the reasons why… only those who entered the Merlin Trials before would be aware.\nThe skill tree appeared before Leonel the moment his platform connected to the large stage. Seeing it upfront and personal like this, Leonel realized there was a lot he had missed before.\nThe skill tree actually had three 'roots'. These roots were the starter Basic Skills that didn't have any prerequisites to unlock. Among these roots, there was the weaponry root, the physical root and finally the special skill root.\nFrom what Leonel could tell, the weaponry root were all related to his bow. The physical root was related to movement techniques, use of Force, defensive techniques, and another broad range of matters. It seemed to have the greatest variety. Finally, the special skill root seemed to be universal in its use, meaning that Leonel's special skill tree was likely the same as everyone elses.\nThe special skill root was indeed unique. The more Leonel looked at it, the less it seemed to conform to the previous rules he had come to know.\nFor one, it took more than just skill points to unlock them. You seemed to need to pair them with rewards for trials that had been cleared. In addition, there were sometimes less stringent prerequisites and sometimes more.\nFor example, the Silver Skill 'Force Burst' could explosively increase the strength of Force attacks for a time. However, it required the unlocking the Bronze Skill 'Force Burst' three separate times.\nHowever, there were also some Gold Skills that had no prerequisites whatsoever. It didn't seem to have much rhyme or logic to it.\nThat said, Leonel took a mental note of this. He didn't believe it was without reason.\nLeonel turned his attention back to the weaponry root.\nLeonel's weaponry root was a Basic Skill named 'Single Shot'. Much like the demon's 'Single-handed Bash' it allowed him to fire one arrow every three seconds.\n<Skill Point Remaing: 3>\nThe voice suddenly snapped Leonel out of his thoughts. He was pleasantly surprised for a moment before understanding. This must be his advantage as a beneficiary of a Minor Opening.\nThe jealous gazes he was receiving pretty much confirmed this. Some even seemed to be urging him to hurry up. After all, Leonel had been standing for a while.\nBut, Leonel turned a blind eye to these people. Since there wasn't a time limit, he would imprint this skill tree in its entirety into his Dreamscape.\n'Wait…'\nLeonel's eyes suddenly flashed as his mind nearly exploded with blinding arcs of lightning.\nHe couldn't believe he hadn't thought of this before. If he imprinted his skills into his Dreamscape, in the midst of battle, would his ability be able to deduce the perfect response every time?\nOriginally, he had only wanted to imprint this skill tree into his mind so he could deduce the optimal path for skill unlocks, but he realized there was much more benefits to this than he thought.\n'Outside these trial grounds, I don't have 'skills' that I put into use. It's too freeform, so it's difficult to use my Dreamscape…'\nThis was the real reason Leonel never thought of using his Dreamscape like this. Real life wasn't a game, you couldn't just breakdown a person's abilities into 'skills' they could use at any given time… or… could you?\nIf Leonel broke down all of his techniques and abilities into their simplest forms, then arranged them into his Dreamscape, what would happen then?\n'Let's use these Trial grounds as a test…'\nThis environment was perfect for Leonel to test whether or not his idea was viable. In here, he really could only use skills provided by Merlin. What better place would there be to test whether or not this new application of Dreamscape would work?\nIf this worked, this would fix another big problem Leonel was having as well. To now, he had yet to be capable of fluidly linking all the spear legacies he was gaining. But… what if he could arrange all his spear skills into his Dreamscape as well?!\nLeonel's breathing hitched slightly. If this worked, his ability which had always been lacking in direct combat might allow him to become a true monster…\nHowever, Leonel knew he couldn't get ahead of himself. In order to use his Dreamscape in this way, he had to raise his battle sense to obscene levels. Only by being able to read his opponent would he be able to perfect the suggestions of his Dreamscape.\n'Experience… It all comes down to experience…'\nLeonel's gaze turned bright. These Merlin Trials would be perfect for him.\nThe moment he made this decision, he blocked out the entire world. He didn't care about the impatience of those waiting for him, his heart had slowed to a crawl.\n<Basic Skill 'Single Shot' Chosen>\n<Basic Skill 'Quick Reload' Chosen>\n<Basic Skill 'Stacked Shot' Chosen>\n<Skill Points Remaining: 0>\n<Trial Commencing>\nThe moment the voice descended, a quiver of arrows descended before Leonel.\n<Basic Quiver>\n<Capacity: 10 arrows>\n<Reload Time: 60 sec>\n<Reload Capacity: 1 arrow>\nLeonel understood immediately. This basic quiver gave him 10 arrows and a single arrow would be replenished every minute. It seemed that his advantage in weapons didn't extend to his arrows, but this was fine too. He had enough advantages already.\nHis gaze turned serious as the shield around the metallic beast disappeared. It was the very same beast the demon faced and it was likely the invisible barrier the demon cracked was now revitalized.\nLeonel felt that Little Blackstar and Tolly's movements were restricted the moment the trial began, but he wasn't surprised. On the special skill tree, he had already seen numerous skills related to familiars. It seemed he wouldn't be able to make use of them until he unlocked them.\nBut, this was fine. For now, Leonel didn't think he needed them just yet.\nHe brandished his bow, nocking his first arrow.",

      "content": "Leonel took a step forward.\nHe realized that no matter what he did, his steps were measured. Exactly 0.50 meters apart without the slightest hint of deviation. He couldn't speed up, nor could he slow down. Even taking a sidestep was difficult. If he wanted variations in his steps and speed, the only way was to begin unlocking the physical root.\nHowever, he wasn't worried. He had already seen one person pass this test so all the stats of the beast had long since been reflected in his mind.\n[Metallic Beast]\n[Power: 1 Stars (Black)]\n[Strength: 1 Star (Black); Speed: 1 Star (Black); Agility: 2 Stars (Black); Coordination: 4 Stars (Black); Stamina: ?? Stars (Black); Reactions: 4 Stars (Black); Defense: 3 Star (Black); Spirit: ?? Stars (Black); Force: ?? Stars (Black)]\n[Power Accuracy: 100%]\nLeonel knew that this assessment was 100% accurate. This metallic beast was purposely nerfed by Merlin. As such, all of its abilities were perfectly measured without the variation one would expect in real life.\nIn addition, during this first trial, it seemed that the beast's long, whip-like tail couldn't be used to attack.\nThere were only three attack patterns: 'Lunge', 'Sweep', and 'Bite'.\n'The beast can lunge at most 1.5 meters. A sweep of its claws extended its range by half a meter at most. Bite will only activate if I enter a two meter range of its and also has a range of half a meter. It can attack only once every two seconds and will be stunned for 0.20 seconds after suffering a hit, however, if I hit it in that spot…'\nThese kind of perfectly measured battles… They were simply too easy for Leonel.\nSHUUU!\nAn arrow appeared right between the brows of the metallic beast just as it was stalking its way toward Leonel.\n'Stacked Shot.' Leonel thought to himself.\nHe reloaded his bow, shooting again.\nNormally, having unlocked 'Quick Reload', Leonel could fire a normal 'Single Shot' once every 2.5 seconds instead of once every 3. However, when 'Stacked Shot' was activated, Leonel could fire two shots consecutively with a reload time of just 1 second.\nLeonel used his steps, circling around the beast. A normal hit would stun it for 0.20 seconds. However, whenever its single eye was attacked, it would be enough to stun it for a full second, allowing one to get more hits in.\nHowever, Leonel didn't use it in this way. He had a limited amount of arrows and wasn't like the others. It was inadvisable for him to just unload. In addition, a single second wasn't even enough time for him to do so.\nRather than doing so, Leonel took this time to constantly adjust his footsteps, taking care to control not only himself, but the angles of attack the metallic beast could use.\nLeonel realized that while this space could hinder almost all of his abilities — whether it be his abilities as an Earth Mage or a Light Mage — the one thing it could not hinder in the slightest was his ability!\nHe realized this was the same for Little Blackstar as well. There were only two reasons he didn't use Little Blackstar. First, he needed to properly vet his new path and potential use for his Dreamscape himself. If he used Blackstar, it would defeat the purpose. And secondly, while this space couldn't block Blackstar's ability, what it could do was stop his ability to move at all.\nLeonel believed that the moment he unlocked the Familiar special skill, Little Blackstar would be able to use his full range of abilities.\nAs Leonel was lost in thought, falling into the steady rhythm of battle, the demon who had gone before him felt his whole world plummeting. Why did Leonel make it look so… easy?\nBANG!\nThe invisible protective barrier shattered once more, sprinkling down like a rain of broken glass.\n<First Trial Complete>\n<Time Taken: 27:22>\n<Trial Grade: A>\n<Skill Points Rewarded: 4>\n<Special Reward: 1 Special Store Ticket>\n'Special Store Ticket…?'\nLeonel didn't use this ticket immediately. He assumed this special store was a place he could go to to upgrade his equipment. His bow was fine, but his quiver was lacking, as an example. However, Leonel also noticed that there was no currency. This made him realize that he likely had to pay skill points to buy items, And, in the case it wasn't skill points that were necessary, that just meant he didn't have the funds necessary to buy anything to begin with.\nin that case… it wasn't worth it just yet. It was better that he spend his skill points on himself for now.\nLeonel turned his attention back to his skill tree.\n'I need 5 skill points and something called a 'star point' to give Little Blackstar the ability to move… In that case, I'll just focus on myself for now.'\n<Basic Skill 'Side Step' Chosen>\n<Basic Skill 'Advanced Quick Reload' Chosen>\n<Basic Skill 'Reinforced Arrow' Chosen>\n<Basic Skill 'Critical Arrow' Chosen>\nLeonel had already made his decision before his battle even began.\n'Side Step' would allow him some more freedom in movement. It was essentially a lunge to the side that he could use in critical moments to move himself to the left or right by a meter.\n'Advanced Quick Reload' would quicken his reload from 2.5 seconds to 2 seconds.\n'Reinforced Arrow' was his first Force ability. It undid the shackles on his Force by a small amount and allowed him to reinforce his arrows. With this, he would finally be able to use the Tier 9 Black Grade gloves he had designed for this bow, albeit it by a small margin.\n'Critical Arrow' worked just like a video game's critical strike did. It gave him a boosted chance of dealing more damage to his foes. Though it was a passive ability, due to the percentages, it would become very useful in the future especially when he began to fire more arrows. And, most importantly, 'Critical Arrow' was a prerequisite for many of the higher level skills he was eyeing…\nLeonel took a deep breath and stepped back onto his platform. He could sense numerous gazes on him, many of which were both hostile and cautious. It was clear that after his performance, many had begun to take him as a serious competitor.\n<A-grade Recovery Rewarded>",

      "content": "A pilar of golden light fell onto Leonel's body.\nAt first, he thought it was a pity. Aside from soreness in his muscles from pulling his bow again and again, there wasn't much else wrong with him.\nHowever, the moment the pillar fell onto him, Leonel realized that he had thought too simply.\nLeonel felt his meditation technique begin to circulate on its own. He immediately realized that this meditation technique wasn't one he had learned from Camelot, but rather a meditation technique he had grasped from [Merlin's Bestrowal: Bowman King].\nMeditation techniques all relied on breathing. This wasn't only the expansion and contraction of the lungs, but of the Force Nodes as well.\nWhere they differed in complexity was in the purity of Force they used to temper one's already existing Internal Strength and the methods by which breathing could be done.\nMany meditation techniques could only intake energy through the mouth and nose. Some higher level techniques could use the hands in thanks to special seals formed by the fingers.\nHowever, Merlin's technique was on a completely different level. It could absorb Force directly through the Ethereal Glabella. Not only was Force capable of doing this exceptionally pure, but it was also incredibly dense, making it easier to Crystallize one's Force.\nThe special Force capable of doing this was known as Star Force.\nStar Force was among the highest level Forces in all of existence, existing on a level no inferior to Light Elemental or Dark Elemental Force. In fact, this was only when considering the lowest grade Star Force there was. When the highest order Star Forces were taken into consideration, even such Elemental Forces could not compare.\nOf course, this was just a matter of differing quality. There were always exceptions to the rule. There were stronger and weaker inheritances of Light and Darkness as well. But, this wasn't important at the moment.\nWhat was important was that Star Force was well known for two abilities: its purity and its density.\nCompared to other Forces, Star Force was the most well known for its purity. Not only was it exceptionally pure, but it could influence its surroundings to be purified. In fact, this latter abilities where much of its preciousness came from.\nIn addition, Star Force was naturally dense. Even without undergoing Crystallization, a given portion of Star Force could execute more actions than the same amount of another Force.\nWhat Leonel realized at that moment was that this recovery opportunity wasn't just for healing his body, but it also circulated his meditation technique for him, purifying his Force.\nLeonel immediately realized that this refinement was several times faster than it had been in the past.\nSuddenly, Leonel's expression changed.\nThe two stars within his Ethereal Glabella began to greedily absorb the Star Force flooding into him. Soon, they began to spin faster, pulsing out with radiant Star Force that was a level purer and denser than what was provided by Merlin's Trial grounds.\nLeonel felt like he had been hit by a bolt of lightning.\n[Dimensional Cleanse]… Could it rely on Star Force as well?\nNow that he thought about it, every time he formed a Star, his body would be cleansed and impurities would be washed from his body. DIdn't that conform with the abilities of Star Force?\nLeonel couldn't believe he hadn't made this connection before.\nAt that moment, he realized another weakness of his Dreamscape. Things he didn't place within his Dreamscape obviously couldn't be used to draw conclusions.\nLeonel had never placed his own techniques within his Dreamscape. Everything that could be found within it now were things he had read within the Mage and Knight Academy libraries!\nLeonel took a deep breath, quickly circulating the meditation technique. This time, he didn't restrict his Stars, instead allowing them to act as they pleased.\nIn the past, he hadn't been able to absorb enough Star Force at once to elicit this response. But now that he had, he realized his body was perfectly suited to Merlin's meditation technique.\nOthers continued to take their trials, but Leonel didn't have time to spare for them.\nBy the time the feeling faded away, Leonel realized that just one of these rewards was the equivalent of an entire month of meditation for him. If he continued at this pace, in another dozen or so trials, he would have enough assurance to form his Ninth and Tenth Nodes!\nLeonel felt that once he formed these final two Nodes, he wouldn't have anything to fear within this Zone any longer. He felt a keen anticipation.\nBut soon, he buried these thoughts deep within his heart.\nEven after the pillar of light stopped, Leonel didn't open his eyes. Rather, he had focused his attention on the skill tree once more. Namely, the skill at the very top.\nIn truth, there were five.\nOne pictured an endless snowy plane. The whistling of harsh winds and sharp, fluttering snow made Leonel feel a bite of cold just by looking at it.\nThe second was a forest painted in red, yellow and brown. It was a lush landscape of Fall that made one gasp in astonishment. However, it carried with it a withering feeling that ate at the heart as though reminding you that death was a step away.\nThe third was filled with greenery. A sun hung high in the sky, beaming down with endless heat. Leonel felt as though his eyes were being scorched just by glancing at it.\nThe fourth could only be described like a cool breeze. It was fleeting and calm while carrying an air of rebirth and revitalization.\nThese four skills were linked and came together as one to form the highest level skill.\nThis highest level skill could only be described as having a myriad of changes.\nLeonel knew exactly what these skills represented. When he first laid eyes on them, he couldn't help but be shocked. To think that these Trials could give him such an opportunity.\nHowever, grasping it would be troublesome. The only method of doing so would be to unlock every skill of the weaponry root.\nStill, the moment he laid eyes on it… Leonel knew he had to no matter what.",

      "content": "[Author's Note: I keep getting caught up in the story and always forget to properly explain this part of DD's magic system, so we'll finally get to it now, lmao]\nIn the universe, the current state of Leonel's Force Strengthening Deviations can be called by many names. However, the one that resonated the most with Leonel was the Embryonic Stage. These so-called Embryos were represented by the small translucent spear and the 12-sided Star in Leonel's Ethereal Glabella -- each representing Leonel's Spear Embryo and Light Embryo respectively.\nUnlike the various fictions Leonel had indulged in back when his life was more normal, the comprehension of Force Strengthening Deviations was incredibly complex. Each path had a myriad of variations making it so that two people at the same level could be of vastly differing strengths.\nUltimately, the path of improving one's Force Strengthening Deviations — or, rather, comprehending and refining them — was known by some wise men as the Comprehension of the Cycles of the Universe.\nForce Strengthening Deviations represented the mysteries of the universe. In order to use them to the highest standard, it was thus necessary to comprehend these so-called Universe Cycles. And, how thoroughly one comprehended them dictated just how powerful one's Force Strengthening Deviations would be.\nThis matter was difficult to comprehend at first, but the highest level skills of Merlin's Trial painted it perfectly.\nThe simplest Universe Cycle in all of existence were the Four Seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall. This level of comprehension was known as the Four Seasons Realm. The current Leonel could be considered to be at the Embryonic Stage of the weakest Four Seasons Realm!\nThat said, calling the Four Seasons Realm weak simply did not do it justice. Even those strong enough to progress through this Universe Cycle and comprehend the next may not do so perfectly. Refining one's Force Embryo to the point of comprehending the profundities of the Four Seasons wasn't a simple task by any stretch of the imagination.\nWhat made mastering this Realm exceptionally difficult was the fact that not all Force Embryos were compatible with this compression.\nIf you comprehended a Fire Embryo and wanted to master the Winter Variation of the Four Seasons Realm, just how difficult would that be? Just the idea alone didn't seem to make any sense.\nAs a result, many failed to comprehend the Four Seasons Realm in its entirety and could only be assumed to have gained small insights into it. Only the most exceptional of geniuses could comprehend all four aspects of the Four Seasons Realm and use it as a foundation to proceed to the next Universal Cycle profundity.\nCompared to Elemental Force Strengthening Deviation, Weapon Force Embryos had a comparatively easier time. However, the difficulty was still as troublesome as ascending to the skies. One could spend a lifetime comprehending just a portion of the mysteries in this so-called 'weakest' Universal Cycle.\nBy now, it should be obvious why Leonel was so shocked by these Merlin Trials. If he was to believe what was before him now, it would be possible to comprehend all four aspects and even fuse them into one if he completed this Trial to its entirety.\nOne had to know that the fusion phase of the Four Seasons Realm was the most difficult. It was already hair raising to attempt just to comprehend each of the Four Seasons individually. But, combining them into one was even more so. However, it was only by completing a perfect fusion that one lay the most perfect foundation for the next stage.\nThis was the world of Force Strengthening Deviations. Only by comprehending these profound Universal Cycles could one truly become powerful.\nThis was exactly why Leonel couldn't just break into the next realm with his Spear Embryo. The more spear comprehensions he observed, the more all-encompassing his eventual fusion would be. The better he could capture the myriad of changes the Four Seasons represented… the more potent and powerful his spear would be!\n'The next Realm after the Four Seasons Realm is known as the Heavenly Body Realm. It requires comprehending The Meteor, The Moon, The Planet and The Star. But, I can forget about comprehending them perfectly or even fusing them into one if I can't clear the Four Seasons Realm first.'\nThe Four Seasons Realm was the equivalent of the Third Dimension. However, when mastered, it was the equivalent of peak existences within the Fourth Dimension. Likewise, the Heavenly Body Realm was the equivalent of the Fourth Dimension, when fully mastered it was the equivalent of peak existences within the Fifth Dimension.\nThough… these things are easier said than done. And the reason for this is due to the fact there are different kinds of comprehensions within each Realm.\nThe first kind of comprehension is one who doesn't attempt to grasp the Universe Cycle at all. For example, Leonel could try to forcefully evolve his current Third Dimensional Spear Embryo into one of the Fourth Dimension as long as he gains access to Fourth Dimensional Force.\nThis sort of comprehension is the weakest and is known by various existences as 'Shell Comprehension' or 'Empty Comprehension'.\nThe second kind of comprehension is the one displayed here. This is relying on the comprehension of another to grasp the truths of the Four Seasons Realm.\nLeonel wasn't certain if he would be allowed to keep Merlin's comprehensions when he left these trial grounds, but if he could, then he would fall into this second kind of comprehension.\nThis sort of comprehension was in the middle of the first and the third kind. It wouldn't be as powerful as the peak existences of the Fourth Dimension, but it should be able to make Leonel undefeatable within his own realm of strength with a fair amount of ease.\nThe third kind of comprehension was the most powerful. This kind was the result of one relying on themselves to comprehend the truths of the Four Seasons and fusing them into one. Only in this instant would the true strength of the Four Seasons be perfectly displayed and only then would it truly be possible to leap an entire realm to battle.\nAfter knowing all of this, the reason why Leonel would be so eager to gain these skills was obvious. Even though it wasn't as good as comprehending the third way, it would still be very helpful to him. It would allow him to lay a foundation for his own personal comprehension in the future!\nIn addition, this was just for the bow. Currently, Leonel's main weapon was the spear. He wasn't so arrogant to believe that he could grasp everything in his hands. He was only one man and he was already struggling with juggling everything he had to learn and master already.\nIn such a case, wasn't mastering the second kind of comprehension better than not comprehending it at all? In that way, he wouldn't have to worry about his bow skills lagging behind for a long while. In addition, by using his bow as a framework, he would be able to light his path of the spear. It would definitely become many more times easier to bring his Spear Embryo to completion in these circumstances.\nBut, once again, Leonel forced himself to calm down. The number of skill points he would need numbered in the tens of thousands. In addition, he hadn't even formed a Bow Embryo yet. He was getting too ahead of himself. He had to take this step by step.\nJust as Leonel was reaffirming his own resolve, a familiar voice sounded once again.\n<First Trial Complete>\n<Time Taken: 12:52>\n<Trial Grade: Perfect>\n<Skill Points Rewarded: 6>\n<Special Rewards: 1 Special Store Ticket, 2 Star Points>\nLeonel's brows shot up.\nHis head immediately snapped toward the platform to see who had gotten such an exaggerated result, only to find King Arthur standing over the metallic beast, his back straight and his aura towering.",

      "content": "Leonel was shocked by the result.\nIf he was honest with himself, he believed that he had already done about as well as anyone could. However, reality was cruel.\nIt wasn't just King Arthur that performed better than he did. Following him, whether it was Pope Margrave, Modred, or Peirce, each of them gained a perfect evaluation. What truly embarrassed Leonel was that there were even two demons who hadn't benefited from Minor Openings that managed to gain Perfect evaluations as well.\nBefore those two demons stepped forward, Leonel had thought it was due to the fact he was at a disadvantage. After all, while other beneficiaries of Minor Openings didn't have to worry about anything other than their weapon, Leonel had to balance his powerful bow with his weak arrows.\nHowever, after observing for a while longer, Leonel realized that things weren't so simple. If two demons with normal weapons could succeed then there had to be a problem with him.\nHad he been too conservative? But Leonel really couldn't think of a way for him to have been more aggressive.\nAs Leonel was realizing that matters wouldn't be as simple as he thought, the shock only continued to grow.\nAfter the two demons passed with Perfect evaluations, Supreme Monet stepped forward and received yet another.\nThis time, Leonel wasn't the only one who was shocked either.\nMonet used a whip. But, it was clear by its quality that she too was just another regular participant of these trials.\nHowever, where she distinguished herself was in the fact that while Leonel had to unlock his Force wielding abilities, Monet didn't!\nRaging flames surged out from her body and coated her whip, making her every strike easily worth tens of times that of another. In the end, she shattered the protective shield around the metallic beast in less than ten minutes, setting a new record.\nToward such a display, Leonel couldn't help but frown. It seemed he had begun to take some things for granted. He couldn't afford to lose his focus chasing after dreams when there was very real danger right before him. He still wasn't aware if Monet would be on his side or not.\nHis first priority was to survive. Only if that was possible would he give his everything to master the Four Seasons Realm with his bow.\n'As expected, these trial grounds can't restrict abilities. Just like I can use mine freely, so can Monet. I had originally assumed that no one in Camelot or in Modred's Demon Army had abilities, but what if it's not that they don't, but that it's rare?'\nLeonel began to silently inspect the two demons. It wasn't long before he understood just where their specialties lied.\n'They have inborn natural strength. It seems that the abilities those of this Mythological Zones have aren't as broad and varied as ones from back on Earth, but it's possible for rare variations like this to occur…'\nLeonel didn't dare to casually inspect King Arthur with his Internal Sight, but he believed that if he did, King Arthur might very well have such special inborn strength as well. Coupling that with the fact he had Excalibur and everything would make sense.\nThe only questionable one was Modred. She should have been in a similar position to Leonel, only being able to rely on long ranged attacks from weak spells. Her situation was not much different from his own. Yet, she still managed to gain a Perfect evaluation.\nUltimately, though their situations were similar, they still differed by one major point. While Modred's wand could amplify the strength of her 'weak' spells, it was difficult for Leonel's bow to do the same for his arrows, at least not by the same measure.\nLeonel grew more serious the more he thought. It seemed he had fallen a step behind. There were already seven people with better evaluations than him.\nIt was fine for Monet and the two demons for now since they didn't get the initial boost of skill points Leonel did. At most, they were on par with him with all of them having received seven total skill points. But, if things continued like this, Leonel would only fall further behind.\nIn addition, if Leonel couldn't perform better, he doubted that he would ever earn enough skill points to trade for the Fall, Winter, Summer and Spring Embryos, let alone the fusion of them all. To make matters worse… not everyone had gone yet, who knew if there were other monsters waiting in the wings.\nNow that Leonel thought about it, the others that had entered this Zone with him also had abilities that wouldn't be restricted.\nAs though to confirm Leonel's worries, Big Buddha and Violet Rain went up one after another. Big Buddha seemed to have gained large gloves for his hands from the weapon selection round while Violet Rain had chosen a sword. Both of their battles were without suspense.\nAS though even this wasn't enough, after many had gone, Little Nana was the last to go up.\nLeonel frowned when he saw her. Compared to the shy little girl she had been when he last saw her, she seemed somewhat even more reserved and … scared?\nLeonel's initial thought was that she had been scared by the trial. After all, she was only a teenage girl and younger than even the young Leonel by several years, didn't it make sense if she was scared?\nHowever, when she used her bind ability and then easily dispatched the metallic beast to the point of breaking Monet's record, Leonel realized that her fear wasn't toward the beast, but rather toward turning back to approach… Pope Margrave?\nLeonel's frown deepened. Could the death of the other Adurna family members be related to the Pope?\nBut this didn't make any sense. Why would the Pope kill them all but Little Nana? And, if he did do so, why would he allow Little Nana to enter these trial grounds? Shouldn't he be like King Arthur, doing everything in his power to stop her from entering?\nThe more Leonel thought about it, the more confused he seemed to become.\nJust when he wanted to see if it was possible to communicate with the little girl directly, a familiar voice sounded.\n<Trial 1 has been completed>\n<Milestone Reached: 10 participants have earned Star Points>\n<Trial 2 has been postponed, Elimination Round commencing>\n<Elimination Goal: 10>\nThe small grey platforms began to rumble.\n<First Elimination Round — Begin!>",

      "content": "Leonel shot up from his platform without the slightest hesitation. Though he hadn't expected such a thing to happen, he realized that there had to be a reason why others still dared to have thoughts of targeting him. The only explanation was that a round exactly like this one existed.\nThe smaller grey platforms shot toward the large. In one swift motion, not only did the metallic beast disappear, but they were all dropped toward it.\nThe large platform expanded. Soon, it was about 200 meters in width and length, but this sort of situation left Leonel frowning. There were over 200 people who had entered these trials. This sort of platform might seem large but…\n'200 meters… 40 000 square meters… that leaves 200 square meters to a person.'\nUltimately, when the math was broken down, everyone got a 14 by 14 meter region to themselves. How was this considered to be much space at all?\nFor Leonel, who had taken the path of a bowman, he would be placed at a striking disadvantage.\nLeonel's gaze suddenly flickered.\n'What is that?'\nRealizing the danger he was in as he fell toward the large platform, Leonel immediately chose the smartest path available to him and began to pay attention to those that could threaten him. Of course, all those that fell into such a category were those who managed to gain Perfect evaluations.\nHowever, in doing that, Leonel found something that stunned him. Each and every one of them had two orbs of light hovering above their heads, whereas no other person had such an orb of light.\n'Those… Those have to be the Star Points they earned. Could it be that they can be stolen during an elimination round?'\nLeonel's eyes widened. That had to be so. Why else would they only appear now?\nIf he noticed such a thing, how could others not notice as well?\n'In that case…'\nLeonel's feet hadn't even landed onto the large grey platform yet when he had drawn his bow.\nA hint of Force wrapped around his bow, causing it to glow with just the slightest sheen. However, in the next moment, the seemingly normal light began to crackle with faint hints of yellow lightning suffused with the green glow of wind.\nLeonel hadn't been able to use the ability of his glove treasure until now because his Force was restricted. But after unlocking 'Reinforced Arrow', everything would be different.\nLeonel also realized something else. While he was at a disadvantage in being in such a closed space, he also had a huge advantage as well… Among those soon to land on this platform… none were safe from him!\n'Reinforced Arrow!'\nSHUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!\nThe sharp sound of wind and crackling lightning took hold of everyone's senses. Everyone had been entirely focused on where they would land on the platform and the enemied they'd have in their immediate surrounding, how could they expect that not only would someone attack while still in the air, but that they'd also attack someone over a 100 meters from them?!\nOne of the two demons with inborn strength was completely caught off guard by Leonel's actions. How could he have ever expected to be targeted at this time?\nIn his shock, he acted on reflex, trying to deflect Leonel's arrow, but to his horror, he realized that the rules of the Merlin Trials were still restricting his movements. He hadn't spent any skill points on the physical root, and even if he had, the maneuvers one could buy that applied to this situation were too far up for him to even afford.\nFeelings of disgruntlement and unwillingness welled up in the demons heart. Who among those who were here weren't heroes of their generation? Each of them stood at the top of their respective Kingdoms. To die like this…? And even while being unable to use his true strength…? He was unresigned!\nPUU!\nA bloody hole shot through the Demon Lord's skull.\nBefore anyone could react, the two orbs of light above his head flickered and disappeared, reappearing above Leonel.\nWith a harsh bang, Leonel landed on the platform. It was unfortunate, but he only had time to aim and fire a single arrow. However, the benefits he had gained were unimaginable. He hadn't thought he'd get the chance to earn Star Points so quickly. Now, all he needed was five skill points and he'd be able to allow Blackstar the ability to move.\nJust when Leonel was feeling that he had benefited, he suddenly felt his heart go cold. Even after all this time, the primitive man's instincts still ran through his veins, making him feel as though he was in imminent danger.\nLeonel looked up to find not a small number of eyes on him. Whether it was the demons or the humans, the vast majority had turned their attention toward him.\nIt was only then Leonel realized that he might very well have acted too rashly.\nIf he realized the advantages and disadvantages he had, how could others not as well? Leonel might have benefited in catching everyone off guard, but now he was pegged as the most dangerous whether or not this was the objective reality.\nEveryone realized that if they turned their back to Leonel now and fought their own battles, who was to say that they wouldn't be the next to suffer beneath one of his sneak attacks.\nThis wasn't all, either. They all realized that Leonel now had two star points floating above his head. Not only would killing him now benefit them into the future, but whoever did so would gain two star points. The benefit of such a thing was inconceivable.\nLeonel slowly took a step back, but realized he couldn't take another. This wasn't because he was at the edge of the platform. In truth, at this moment, he would rather prefer if he was.\nUnfortunately, though he couldn't be said to be in the middle of the large square platform, he was still about 40 to 50 meters from its bottom edge and over a hundred meters from his closest side edge.\nSuddenly, he was faced with enemies from all sides…",

      "content": "Leonel felt his skin prickle, his palms becoming sweaty. The hairs on his body stood on end, raising like needles across his skin,\nIn his life, he had never been in such a dangerous situation. The eyes of over 200 elites locked onto him, not a single one making a move. Even the other star point owners were completely ignored.\nThis was just how human nature was. The process of group think, the oppression of the masses. Once a few had locked onto Leonel, not moving an inch, others followed suit. Soon, even the slowest among them had come to realize the truths behind this matter. By then, they were no longer just following the leads of others around him, but had begun thinking about how they could gain advantages for themselves.\nLeonel felt stifled to the point his knees trembled slightly. He tried to steady his grip on his bow, doing his best to calm the beating of his heart.\nIt had been a long time since Leonel felt like this. After the first few weeks of his time in the Mayan Tomb, he had begun to slowly temper his battle will and heart.\nTo now, he had fought in many battles and been on the frontline for many of them. However, today was the greatest pressure he had ever faced.\nBeads of sweat poured down his brow and his breathing hitched. His inability to control himself made him feel as though he wasn't getting enough oxygen.\nThe suppression continued. It was as though those around Leonel wouldn't stop until he completely collapsed beneath their might.\nFacing the combined pressure of over 200 Demon Lord level and higher individuals was too much for any one person to take. Even an individual on the level of King Arthur or Modred would feel weak at such a moment.\nIn the distance, King Arthur's lip curled into a cold smile.\n'Where is all your previous arrogance?'\nTo now, he had swallowed several grievances due to Leonel. Seeing a brat who thought too much of himself in such a situation gave him untold satisfaction.\nLeonel's blood slowed and his bow seemed to become heavier and heavier with each passing moment. The silence alone was weighing on his mind as though intent on making him go mad.\nA numbing sensation spread throughout his body and the hitching in his breath only seemed to continue. Soon, he felt as though he couldn't breathe at all, as though there wasn't enough air in the world to satiate his lungs.\nLeonel had never felt such a way in his entire life.\nThe truth was that he had always been a daring individual. How could he not be? He used to sky dive off of his Paradise Island onto the skyscrapers of Earth's surface. If that wasn't daring, then what was?\nThat was who he was. Daring, confident… He was a man who always had great belief in his own ability even if that wasn't shown outright as blatant arrogance.\nEven when it came to the Mayan Tomb, just how many could put down their fear and enter that unknown world on their own? Just how many people would have waited for the others to wake up first? Or cower in fear after running into their first battle?\nThough Leonel's actions back then seemed stained by his unwillingness to kill, beneath the first and most obvious layer, there was a hidden depth of courage and bravery.\nBut it felt as though all of that was crumbling down now.\nIt was sudden and abrupt. It came without warning and without foreshadowing. These were just the way things in life worked. But at the same time, it represented yet another one of the myriad of choices one had to make along their path.\n'Is this where I'll die?'\nLeonel had this same thought for the third time in his life.\nThe first was when the sacrificial virgin of the Mayan Tomb had her hands wrapped around his neck. The second was during his battle with Lamorak who had eyes on him even now. And the third was now…\nThe first time, he accepted death. It was a shame that still rested on his shoulders, one he still had yet to face himself.\nThe second time he was unwilling, but to this day, he still had no real idea how he managed to survive. To take credit for such a thing was beneath him. Ultimately… he had just been lucky.\nAnd now this third time? Would he fail himself again? Was that the choice he wanted to make?\nLeonel's slipping grip on his bow tightened.\nHe was unwilling.\nLeonel suddenly raised his head up and shouted. The sound he made wasn't as coherent as words nor as powerful as a roar. It was as though he was venting something within his chest, pushing it out from himself until it had nothing to do with him any longer.\nThe sudden noise in an otherwise deathly silent atmosphere left many stunned. By the time Leonel had closed his mouth once more and leveled his gaze to meet those around him, the deathly calm of his gaze had returned.\nPersistence.\nHe didn't feel ashamed for having felt fear, but he most definitely would had he allowed it to rule him.\nA halo of bronze shone atop Leonel's head. However, at this moment, it felt as though the violet hue was several levels more powerful than it had been in the past. Even without the rest of Leonel's Runes activated, his eyes became a deep violet, his hair fluttering wildly beneath his stabilized aura.\nAt that moment, an oppressive might gushed from Leonel's body. His focus reached unprecedented levels and his will stood tall and firm. Though he didn't realize it then, the chains of his black spear began to clang wildly as though it too was standing beneath the mighty winds of his aura.\nWhen his mind had calmed, he felt like a fool. This wasn't a battle to the death nor did he have to kill all of these people before him.\nEven if they all wanted to kill him, so what? All he had to do was take down nine more… As long as nine of them died beneath his hand or the hand of others, he would survive.\nLeonel pulled an arrow from his quiver, his aura steadily climbing with each moment of silence.\nHe could still feel the pressure weighing down on his shoulders. How could he not? These were all existences he would have to go all out to battle even if it was just one on one, let alone when there were so many.\nHowever, to the current him, the amount of pressure no longer mattered. His arrow would be the blade that cut through it all.\nHe didn't need to breathe a word. His demeanor said it all.\nCome.",

      "content": "Leonel sudden change caught them all of guard. Even with their experience, they had never witnessed such a thing. However, Leonel didn't need them to react. Since they were standing in a daze, he would take the initiative. He had no intention of standing here and waiting to die.\nLeonel immediately activated 'Stacked Shot', firing two arrows in quick succession.\nBefore the arrows even landed, Leonel realized three things.\n'The sharp aura of my Metal Synergy Lineage Factor gives my arrows added sharpness and strength. With my Lineage Factor activated, the restrictive effect of the laws in this place have been lessened by at least half. I can bend the limitations of my skills for at least the next five minutes.'\nIn that instant, Leonel understood that along with abilities, this space couldn't restrict his Lineage Factor either. The only trouble was that it seemed his stamina was drained faster than it was usually as his bloodline fought back against the restrictions. But, that was fine. Leonel felt that five minutes… five minutes was enough.\nNo one had expected Leonel to be the first to react. However, the demons and humans that stood around him were all veterans of the battlefield. In addition, now that Leonel had lost the advantage of being in the air, they obviously had far more possible rebuttals to actions.\nEven still, of the two demons Leonel targeted, one who had chosen twin daggers as their weapon of choice didn't manage to block Leonel's strike, suffering a bloody hole to the throat. However, the second who had a broad sword as their weapon managed to use it as a shield in the last moment.\nAt that moment, the humans hesitated. Was it really appropriate of them to attack a fellow human while it was so clear Leonel had been targeting demons?\nThis sort of hesitancy was exactly what Leonel wanted. If it was up to him, he would have attacked another demon with a small weapon. He could obviously tell that it would be much more difficult to block. However, he hadn't done so for several reasons.\nFirst, his failure lessened the threat he presented to everyone. Second, it was a question of those around him.\nThere were a total of 4 humans and 6 demons within 20 meters of Leonel. At the same time, Leonel was aware that he wasn't in position to battle so many individuals at once. His best bet was to spark a battle. In the chaos, killing nine more, or rather, eight more would be far easier.\nIn that case… he just needed a spark.\nThe demon wielding a broad sword was forced back by the strength of Leonel's arrow. It didn't even have the mind to realize that its back was completely exposed as it stumbled toward a group of humans who had their nerves on edge.\nLeonel didn't wait to see if his strategy would work. He had already learned once today that not everything would work out how you imagine it to. If it did, he wouldn't be in his current situation.\nWith a flip of his palm, several fish scales appeared. He activated them one after another, layering his body with three Force Skins in one breath.\nUnfortunately, Leonel was correct. Instead of taking the opportunity to strike at the stumbling demon, the humans backed away.\nIn a lot of ways, Leonel could understand their choice. No one wanted to be the one who truly turned this into a battle royale. At the same time, the demons weren't their comrades, so they had no obligation to step in and get revenge. Wasn't it better for them to sit back and wait for a better opportunity to present itself?\nStill Leonel didn't seem to be fazed at all.\n\"BOY!\"\nThe demon who just managed to block Leonel's arrow roared in rage, shooting forward with all the speed he could muster. Unfortunately, everyone was limited to the same slow and evenly spaced steps. In fact, to now, Leonel counted less than ten others than had spent skill points on their movement.\nBy the time the broad sword wielding demon had charged to within five meters of Leonel, the cool down of 'Reinforced Arrow' had completed.\nLeonel's lip curled, his gaze suffused with cold indifference. Though he could shoot a normal arrow once every 2 seconds thanks to 'Advanced Quick Reload', 'Reinforced Arrow' didn't fall under this category. Its cool down was 10 seconds. If not for this, it was impossible for this demon to have blocked his arrow.\nHowever, would Leonel really waste a reinforced arrow on an enemy so close to him. Entering a five meter radius of a bowman with such a limited range of techniques was asking for death.\nLeonel pulled the string of his dark, black bow. Even with his current strength, he only managed to pull it 50% of the way. But, with its strength, this was more than enough.\nThe crackling of lightning sounded once more as Leonel stared down the enraged demon. However, this time, an imperceptible bronze luster coated the arrow as well as though the metal that formed it was resonating with a higher existence.\nThe demon froze. An overwhelming sense of danger shook his heart.\nHe wasn't among the demons who had gained star points. His performance only managed to net him a B evaluation, and that was only after he managed to gain a few tricks after observing those who came before him.\nWhen facing an arrow even a demon who had gained star points couldn't do anything against, how could he not feel as though he had acted rashly?\nHowever, would Leonel care for his feelings?\nSHUUUUUUUUUUUU!!\nThe demon closed his eyes, realizing that death was upon him. But, even after several moments of holding his breath, he seemed to realize that his heart was still beating. In fact, he hadn't even felt any pain.\nIt can't be that a marksman would miss from such a close range… right?\nThe demon snapped his eyes open, a cold sweat matting his back. He was just in time to hear an enraged and mournful cry to his back. Not only that… but he also watched as two more star points manifested above Leonel's head.\n\"What…?\"",

      "content": "Just moments ago, he thought he was safe. He stood silently in a corner of the platform, having been lucky enough to be dropped here.\nHe couldn't have been more happy that Leonel had taken all the attention for himself. He had thought that after these two star points appeared above his heads that he would most definitely become a target. He really had to thank Leonel.\n'Ha, idiot. What are you doing entering the range of a bowman like that without a proper plan. This is the problem with us demons, focusing too much on brawn and not enough brain. How else could we possibly have allowed a female human to become our leader?'\nThe demon clenched his fists.\nHe had already affirmed it in his heart. He would use the entry into these trial grounds to raise his strength above that bitch Modred. He could already imagine her riding beneath his crotch. Of course, he would treat her well. It wouldn't be so bad to have such a powerful queen by his side.\n'Hm? Is that idiot dead yet?'\nThe demon looked up just in time to see a flash of brilliance approaching him at impossible speeds. He blinked just once, yet it had gone from tens of meters from him, to right before him in a flash.\nThe demon's expression changed. He had to dodge.\nJust when he wanted to, his expression changed again.\n'Dammit!'\nHe had completely forgotten that he was already at the corner of the platform. There was… no place to dodge.\nSHUUUUU! PCCHUU!\nIt was only after the arrow had shot through his forehead that the demon realized that dodging was never an option.\nIf there was any solice in death, maybe it would be that he wasn't alone in his despair. The very demon he had called an idiot just moments earlier now found himself in a similar situation.\nStanding in a no-man's land within five meters of Leonel's bow… It was asking for death.\nPCCHUU!\nAnother deathly silence fell over the platform.\nIn an instant, four demons had died beneath five arrows.\n'This boy…'\nThis simple thought was one shared by them all. Going from being suppressed in one instant to taking the lives of three more in the next… Even though they had all witnessed it, they couldn't believe it.\nKing Arthur and Lamorak's expressions darkened. They couldn't believe the sudden change. Now, not only was Leonel safe for the time being, but others would hesitate to come after him.\nThat bravery, that daring… He actually targeted a demon over a hundred meters from him when he was surrounded by enemies from all sides.\nThis feeling… it felt oddly similar to when Leonel strolled out of Camelot's gates…\n\"Dammit! Charge together!\"\nThe demons around Leonel were completely enraged.\nLeonel steadied his breathing, his gaze flashing like lightning. However many came is as many as he would take on.\nIn the distance, Big Buddha and Monet looked on with dark expressions. They had been cautious about making a move before, but it seemed that they might have to. They weren't worried about being seen as the enemies of humans. After all, they were already under the banner of Modred.\nJust when everyone was about to target Leonel, the situation changed once again.\nThe demons who had chosen to charge toward Leonel suddenly found themselves frozen, completely unable to move.\n\"Bind.\"\nThe delicate voice of a little girl rang through the battlefield. Beads of sweat poured down her little face as she pushed her hand forward. It was obvious that binding the three demons that charged toward Leonel in that instant had taken a lot out of her.\nNot only was the distance far, but there were actually three of them. How could she not be struggling.\nSeeing such a scene, Leonel's heart softened with gratitude. His cold and indifferent expression cracked just the smallest bit.\n'Stacked Shot.'\nFeelings were one thing, but Leonel wouldn't allow his actions to lag behind.\nIn an instant, two more bloody holes appeared within the demons.\nThe moment she only had to bind a single person, Little Nana's pressure was reduced by a significant amount, allowing Leonel's cool down to be completed and for him to draw another arrow.\nHowever, Leonel didn't fire this one. He took a step toward the last bound demon and pierced his drawn arrow through her throat. He could see the look of despair as she struggled to break free, but his eyes remained callous.\nIn a flash, Leonel had killed seven and still had three arrows remaining.\nHe drew his bow once more.\nThe contrast of blood dripping from the tip of his drawn arrow and the corpses littered around his body painted a heart palpitating picture.\nAt that moment, everyone had grown hesitant. The ability of that little girl was too powerful. They had all been apprehensive about her earlier and now that she had stepped forward to help Leonel, the situation had gotten several times more complex.\nJust when everyone was shaken and wondering what the next step would be, a pained cry called out.\nLeonel's brow shot up. His bow was still drawn, so this cry was obviously not caused by him.\nHis Internal Sight locked onto a certain region only to find that King Arthur and Modred had both reacted as one, both killing a member of the demons and humans respectively. In fact, their steps didn't pause as both of them shot toward a second target.\nLeonel was shocked. He couldn't understand why they were acting like this.\nTechnically, he was still in a dangerous situation. He hadn't gotten out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination.\nModred's actions could be justified. After all, Leonel had killed seven demons to now. If things continued, she would only fall into more of a disadvantage. However, King Arthur's actions didn't make much sense at all.\nA third cry sounded. In their competition of two, Modred won, taking down a second human. Just as King Arthur's sword descended, a barrier of protection appeared around a shocked demon, saving her at the last moment.\nKing Arthur frowned, but eventually retracted his sword unwillingly. It couldn't be helped. He didn't have long ranged attacks but Modred did.\nJust as Leonel was feeling even more confused, Merlin's voice sounded once again.\n<First Elimination Round Completed>\n<Slaughter Points to be Distributed>\n<Leonel - 5.5 points>\n<Modred - 2 points>\n<Nana - 1.5 points>\n<Arthur - 1 point>\nA sudden understanding came over Leonel. It seemed this was where the last points of currency came from.. It was no wonder they would take action.",

      "content": "Leonel realized then that these slaughter points must have been important. At the very least, they were comparable in use to star points. But, since Leonel hadn't seen anything he could spend them on, he concluded that it might be related to the store ticket he received earlier.\nStill, Leonel didn't spend much time thinking about this. The moment the Elimination Round ended, rather than basking in his victory or the fact he managed to keep his life, he made his way toward Little Nana with the fastest speed he could muster, taking advantage of the loosened restrictions while his Lineage Factor was activated.\nOthers were shaken by his sudden action. However, they sighed a breath of relief when they noticed the protective barriers around them. If they could block King Arthur's strike, they had no need to be worried about Leonel.\nBut, Leonel didn't spare them a glance as he appeared before Little Nana just as their small platforms formed beneath their feet once again. Thanks to his action, he ended up floating in the expanse of black once more with her by his side.\nLeonel smiled toward the little girl. A protective feeling couldn't help but take root in his heart when he saw her delicate brows matted with sweat. It seemed that helping him from so far away hadn't been easy on her.\n\"Thank you, Little Nana.\"\nNana blushed slightly, her large blue eyes twinkling with a slight hint of pride. It seemed she was quite happy that she could help Leonel out. At the same time, she felt slightly more comfortable in her heart with Leonel by her side.\nLeonel wanted to ask her what happened to her family, but he hesitated in the end. He could feel that Margrave had sent a portion of his senses in his direction. Things would be fine as long as he just made it look like he was chatting idly with her. However, if the Pope overheard him asking questions, things might become difficult.\nLeonel sighed in his heart. He could sense that his presence had eased the little girl's tension by a small bit. This was all he could do for her for now.\nIn truth, he wanted to let her enter the Segmented Cube, but the logistics afterward would be difficult.\nWhen it was only LIttle Tolly within the Segmented Cube, it could maintain its small size and even fit into his spatial ring. But, whenever Leonel himself entered, the Segmented Cube couldn't shrink past five cubic meters.\nThis was better than it had been in Phase One. Back then, its smallest size when he entered was ten cubic meters. But, it still wasn't small enough.\nLeonel believed that this had something to do with the strength of his life force. Uncle Montez had said that Little Tolly couldn't enter his spatial bracelet because the little guy was a living being. However, even then, it was easier to accommodate a spirit than a full blown human.\n'Wait… I can let her enter one of the snowglobes…'\nLeonel sealed this thought at the back of his mind.\nThough Little Nana seemed more at ease around him, that was only relative. Ultimately, they had had very few reactions. For a little girl to survive on her own to now, no matter how naive and innocent she looked, she was definitely highly intelligent. It wouldn't be a simple matter to get her to put her whole trust in him.\nIn addition, Leonel was only acting now because he was soft hearted and also owed the little girl a favor now for helping him out. Their relationship couldn't be considered to be deep. It was just that Leonel had a good impression of this little girl despite the fact she had acted against him in the past.\n\"I just helped a little…\" Little Nana said softly, her voice as delicate as a butterfly's? wings. \"… Big Brother is the impressive one, standing up to them like that.\"\nLeonel found it a bit odd Nana called him big brother so directly. But, he assumed that it might have just been the dialect of where she grew up. From his understanding, these hidden families were quite reclusive. Had it not been for the fact she was expelled from her clan for whatever reason, Leonel might have never met Aina in his lifetime.\nAfter organizing his thoughts, Leonel smiled once again and chatted idly with the little girl. However, their conversation didn't last very long before it was interrupted.\n<Would you like to use your Special Store Ticket now?>\nLeonel hesitated. Originally, he wanted to save it until he had more skill points to use since he thought he would need them within the store. But, after gaining slaughter points, he wasn't sure anymore.\n'Forget it. Since I gained a ticket but no star points before, it seemed such tickets are less valuable. I'll enter now even if I can't buy anything.'\n\"I'll be back.\" Leonel told Little Nana.\n\"Mm.\"\nLeonel used his ticket, his body vanishing in the next instant. For a moment, his vision blurred. When he could finally see his surroundings again, he realized that he had entered another wide expanse of black.\nJust as he was feeling confused, a translucent screen appeared before him and a catalog of items appeared. It only took a cursory glance for Leonel to notice that all of these items were high quality, even the worst were B-grade treasures.\nIt was a shame that it didn't matter much to Leonel. He couldn't take anything out of this Zone without it disappearing.\n'Hm… Even if I can't, if I Dream Sculpt items I'm interested in, I can Craft them for myself…'\nThinking to this point, Leonel's mind suddenly latched onto an idea.\nHe remembered that he still had the weird naked sniper's Ethereal Glabella. According to the dictionary, the same way it was possible to refine a Beast Crystal into treasures, it was also possible to do with humans.\nAll this time, Leonel had been greatly hesitant. He didn't like the idea of doing such a thing to a human. It seemed morally… wrong.\nLeonel wasn't wrong either. There was a great taboo against doing such a thing in the world of Force Crafters.\nHowever, as time passed, Leonel realized that his earth escape treasure was becoming less and less reliable. It wasn't that the beast crystals they were formed of were lacking, but rather that his skill in refining them hadn't been good enough.\nThe biggest problem was ultimately that it took too long to activate. It couldn't be used in battle at all. However, the naked sniper's blink ability… It was hard to pass up.\nUnfortunately, Leonel had yet to draw up a satisfactory blueprint for it. He realized that even though he had managed to Craft a Tier 9 Black treasure, his skill couldn't really be considered to be at that level just yet. At most, he was able to use his ability to drill himself into being capable of doing something he would otherwise find impossible.\nBut… if he found a treasure here that accomplished a similar ability, it would make things much easier on him in the future.\nWhat Leonel didn't know was that he had touched on his second taboo already.\nThe first was refining a human into a treasure… and the second was stealing the Craft of another master…",

      "content": "'This isn't working. Going through all of these treasures one by one would take forever…'\nLeonel suddenly had an idea. He wasn't sure if it would work, but it wouldn't cost him anything to try.\n\"Can you show me all short distance teleportation treasures with cool downs less than ten seconds.\"\nMuch to Leonel's surprise, the translucent screen before him immediately reacted. There was a few seconds of rapid scrolling before treasures disappeared one after another, leaving behind a total of five.\nLeonel's gaze brightened. There were two necklaces, one brace, one bracelet, and the last was an ankle brace. They all had short ranges of within ten meters. The highest cool down amongst them eight seconds while the lowest was three.\nLeonel focused on one of the necklaces. Though it was quite feminine, what he cared about was its ability. Worse come to worst, he could just hide it beneath his shirt or armor.\nThis necklace was the overall best treasure here. It had a teleportation distance of three meters and could be used once every three seconds. It was possible to store teleportation charges for up to three attempts. After that, one would have to manually pour Force into it.\nJust when Leonel was about to get ahead of himself and purchase it, he suddenly froze. He remembered he didn't have any of the currency necessary for this Special Store. In fact, he wasn't even aware of what the currency was to begin with.\nLeonel's gaze slowly shifted to the side of the image reflecting in his gaze. When he saw the numbers beside it, he couldn't help but smile bitterly.\n<Treading Goddess Necklace (Legendary Equipment) - 72 000 skill points>\nIf Leonel was a weaker man, he would definitely begin to shed real tears.\n72 000 skill points? He didn't even have one. It seemed he had gotten way too ahead of himself. How could it be so easy to lay his hands on such a treasure?\nThis Treading Goddess Necklace was a Quasi-Bronze treasure. As long as it was a Third or Fourth Dimensional world, it wouldn't weaken in the slightest. How could it be so casually given out?\nLeonel settled his breathing. It seemed he had wasted an entry ticket. He didn't have a single skill point on him. And, even if he did, he wouldn't have the heart to spend it on a piece of equipment. 72 000 skill points was enough to make it a good portion of the way up his skill tree. He couldn't casually use such an amount. His first priority was still mastering the Four Seasons Realm.\nJust as Leonel was about to resign himself to a loss, he suddenly remembered something else. Since this space could respond to his verbal command, maybe it could answer a question of his?\n\"Um, how do I use slaughter points?\"\nThe translucent screen flickered and changed once again.\n<Slaughter Point Exchange>\n<Current Conversion Rate>\n<1 Slaughter Point - 100 Skill Points>\n<1 Slaughter Point - 3 Special Store Tickets>\n<1 Slaughter Point - 1 Star Point>\nLeonel's gaze brightened.\nSo it was like this. Slaughter Points could be traded for a myriad of things.\n'It says current exchange rate… does that mean it's subject to change?'\nLeonel came to a logical conclusion. It was very likely that as the numbers dwindled, slaughter points would gain a boost in value. Who knew, in the future, it might be possible to exchange a slaughter point for thousands of skill points.\n'Arthur must have benefited from these treasures from his last entry, but why is it that he hasn't used them yet…? Is it that he can't due to the restrictions, or is there another reason?'\nLeonel realized that his own treasures didn't seem to have any restrictions. The only reason he hadn't been able to use his wind-lightning glove before was due to the restriction on his Force, not the treasure itself. So, he was unsure if he had an advantage others didn't…\n'Forget it, we'll see how things go.'\nArmed with this new information, Leonel became more confident.\nThe first thing he did was spend 5 skill points and 1 star point to unlock 'A Companion for Life'.\n\"Yip, yip!\"\nFinally feeling that he could move, Little Blackstar excitedly jumped around. The little guy had truly felt too stifled.\nOnce Leonel unlocked Blackstar and Tolliver, he gained a fourth branch of his skill tree related to them. Originally, Leonel had no intention of spending any skill points on this new skill tree. After all, Blackstar's ability couldn't be restricted by this world. There was no need to give him new skills.\nHowever, Leonel froze when he saw a particular skill.\n'Perfect Union'.\nThe moment Leonel saw it, he knew he had to have it. He understood too little about Blackstar's ability while this skill would allow him and Blackstar to essentially share one mind. Everything the little guy felt and all of its instincts would count as Leonel's.\nThe best part about this skill was that it wasn't the highest skill on the tree, nor did it take much to reach it.\n'… It would take 321 skill points to unlock the branches necessary and four star points to reach it…'\nLeonel hesitated.\nIf he converted all of his slaughter points now, he would have 550 skill points. However, he only had three star points left now, so he would only have 450 skill points while the last slaughter point would go toward the last star point he needed…\nLeonel's gaze narrowed. At the moment, he was feeling uneasy in his heart. He felt like things would only become more dangerous from here on out, and who knew when the next Elimination Round would begin.\nLeonel was certain that he would be targeted from the beginning during the next round. It couldn't be helped, he stood out too much and had made many enemies.\n'It ultimately comes down to one question… will understanding Blackstar better give me a greater immediate boost in strength, or would using all 550 skill points on myself do so…'\nLeonel sent a glance toward his own skill tree.\nSeveral calculations fired off in his Dream World. Eventually, he fell into a simulation, the results of which shocked him.\nIt wasn't even close. Investing in Blackstar was by far the best choice.\nLeonel took a deep breath and stopped hesitating.\n<5.5 Slaughter Points Exchanged>\n<1 Star Point Gained>\n<450 Skill Points Earned>\n…\n<Bronze Skill 'Damage Share' Chosen>\n<Bronze Skill 'Vision Share' Chosen>\n…\n<Bronze Skill 'Battle Mount'? Chosen>\n…\n<Silver Skill 'Perfect Union' Chosen>\nThe moment he clicked on this skill, Leonel's mind was suddenly flooded with a whole host of new sensory information.\nLittle Blackstar, who had been playing around, suddenly turned back to Leonel and blinked with an adorable curiosity. The little guy seemed to be wondering why he felt so much closer to Leonel all of a sudden.\nIt took a while for Leonel to regain his bearings, but when he did, a confident smile spread across his face. Up until now, he had still been wondering if he made the right choice. But now, he realized he had.\nWithout another ounce of hesitation, he began to use his remaining hundred or so skill points on himself.\n<Basic Skill 'Triple Shot' Chosen>\n<Basic Skill 'Rapid Fire' Chosen>\n…\n<Basic Skill 'Sprint' Chosen>\n<Basic Skill 'Roll' Chosen>\n<Basic Skill 'High Jump' Chosen>\n…\n<Bronze Skill 'Curved Shot' Chosen>\n<Bronze Skill 'Exploding Shot' Chosen>\n<Bronze Skill 'Armor Pierce' Chosen>\nLeonel spent 80 or so skill points on his skill tree. As for the remaining 50 or so, he spent it all on a Bronze piece of equipment - Bronze Quiver.\nNot only could it hold 25 arrows, but it could spawn another every 30 seconds.\nFeeling confident, Leonel finally left the Special Store. But, what he found when he stepped out doused him from head to toe in cold water.\nKing Arthur stood majestically, his white armor glowing with a fierce light. It was as though it had been completely reborn. It alone made Leonel feel as though a mountain was weighing on his shoulders.\nHow could Leonel know that King Arthur could indeed use treasures he had gained during his last entry. It was just that he had to pay an appropriate price to reactivate them. And, unfortunately… that price was far less than it cost to originally buy the equipment…\n<White Lion King Armor - 60 000 skill points>\n<Reactivation Price - 300 skill points>\nAnother thing Leonel didn't know was that star points could also be exchange for skill points…",

      "content": "Leonel met King Arthur's gaze.\nIt was a short interaction, hardly worth a thiing. Yet, Arthur seemed to realize that Leonel's gaze was even firmer than it had been in the past. Not only that, but he noticed that the little beast lazing around Leonel's neck had grown more active.\n'What is that beast… this boy was actually willing to spend 5 skill points and a star point to allow it to move…?'\nA star point was worth 100 skill points at this juncture. It wasn't a small matter to make the choice to use it. Arthur couldn't help but grow a level more serious.\n<Second Trial Begin!>\nThe world warped. Suddenly, the singular square platforms of a meter in length and width lengthened, stretching into the distance. In the blink of an eye, it formed several long roads the each of them stood at the end of.\nLeonel sent a gaze toward Little Nana before looking back toward the long road ahead of him. Without another thought, he took a strong step forward.\n**\nThe universe was a nearly endlessly vast place. Some believed it was infinite while others believed it was infinitely expanding. There were even some schools of thought that believed there were endless copies of this impossible vastness, each telling the same story a different way.\nStill, there was only one truth.\nThere was just a single universe. However, within this single universe, there were trillion upon trillions of worlds each with billions upon billions of existences of their own.\nIn this universe, there were usually many names for the same thing. However, this universe only went by a single name by those who were advanced enough to realize its profundities — The Dimensional Verse.\nThough the Dimensional Verse was formed of many worlds, it was more accurate to say that these worlds simply represented a 'Fold of Reality'. Each Fold encompassed a world and could be given a Dimensional Grade.\nA single Fold could vary in size. It could be as small as a single city within a planet or as large as an entire galaxy. It is when these Folds begin to evolve that a 'world' is considered to also evolve.\nThe Fold that represented Earth's world encompassed Earth and the Moon. In comparision to other Folds, it was neither too big nor too small. But, it could be said to be convenient.\nWhen Folds are too small, the benefit is also small. The evolution potential will be limited as there are limited gains to a small scale evolution. The smaller the scale, the less change there is to catalyze, and thus the less benefits there are to gain.\nHowever, at the same time, if the Fold is too large, it becomes too difficult to deal with. For a fledgling world like Earth, what could it do if its Fold of Reality encompassed its entire solar system? What if a Zone appeared on Jupiter?\nEven though Earth's advancement in technology has been vast in the past several centuries, what did it matter if it was impossible to use this technology thanks to the Metamorphosis?\nThis wasn't the only issue with large Folds either. The larger the Fold, the more history a Zone could encompass, and the more complex they became to clear. The more random a Zone could become, the more complex its quests become, and the more difficult it was for Zone detection treasures to calculate the quest requirements.\nOf course, a place like Jupiter wouldn't have any real history of its own. That would be nonsensical. However, its addition to a Fold of Reality could cause mutations in an otherwise normal history one would never expect…\nUnfortunately, the size of Folds was destined to always grow. Though it would be nice if it remained the same until the fall of a world, such things were never meant to be.\nDue to this truth, the higher the Dimension of a world, the larger its Fold was, and the more powerful it had to be to survive to its current point.\nAs though this wasn't enough, sometimes growing Folds could clash and begin to overlap, resulting in an instance of two worlds having no choice but to go to war for fear of their own world collapsing…\nStill, these instances were often never reached by a world because the process of survivng a growing Fold of Reality was too much for many worlds to bear…\nThere were many worlds that sat at this crossroad. To the left was a road where they survived and managed to prosper. While the growing of a Fold could devastate a world, it also provided opportunities.\nThe larger a Fold, the more Natural Force Arts it encompassed and the greater resources it could produce.\nHowever, the right was a road of immediate benefits. These worlds would choose to abandon their Folds of Reality to migrate to more stable Higher Dimensional Worlds. But, before they did so, they would wring their world dry of all the resources it had left, using it to fund their new lives…\nMany worlds had a certain ratio of both types of people. Where there was population, there would always be opposing view points.\nWould it be better to build something with your own hands and leave something behind your future generations could admire you for? Or was that foolish? Why shed blood and tears for a reality you wouldn't get to enjoy yourself?\n…\nThe world of Terrain was at a similar crossroads. It had been 500 years since it evolved into a Fourth Dimensional World.\nUnlike Earth, it didn't sit in a Fold of Reality with much potential. According to the higher Dimensional beings, it would at most become a Fifth Dimensional World before reaching the end of its evolution.\nFor worlds that reached the end of their potential, the clashing of these two ideologies would become especially tumultuous. The effort needed to have a world step into its final evolutionary stage was a lot… but just how many were able to put in this necessary effort?\nThat said, whether this clash was relevant to the events occurring at this very moment was very hard to tell. It could only be said that this matter should be left up to those observing…\n…\nAt this very moment, a singular woman was the target of a large scale man hunt.\nThis woman had long, flowing black hair and shining amber eyes that almost looked like shimmering gold when they reflected the sunlight. Even as she ran with all her being, her steps not leaving the slightest trace of her, her gaze didn't lose its alluring beauty.\nHowever, her eyes could be said to be the only beautiful thing about her. When one's eyes landed on her face, the sight would be enough to make even the most stoic of men sigh.\nIt was clear to anyone that she was an impossible to find beauty, the kind that if Leonel were to witness, he would realize that Joan, Monet and Modred couldn't possibly hold a candle to.\nUnfortunatel, this beauty was completely marred by savage scars. They crisscrossed across her face, her cheeks, her lips, like enraged pinkish-purple earth worms.\nThe scars seemed to pulse with her every breath, giving the impression that they were either coursing with a mysterious energy, were on the verge of becoming infected or were severely poisoned. It might even be possible that it was a combination of all three…\nIt was difficult to describe just how horrid the sight was. And, even for a man, let alone a young lady in her prime, it was difficult to accept having such an appearance.\nMost in this young woman's position would choose to cover it up. In fact, for most of her life, this particular woman had chosen to do exactly that. However, her reasons for doing so were very different from what another young woman would give.\nAt this moment, though, these reasons hardly mattered. The life she lived on her home world was far different from the one she lived now. All she cared about was improving and tempering herself, growing powerful enough to one day seek revenge on her enemies. In fact, it was due to these ambitions that she had landed herself in so much trouble.\nThe forces currently chasing her had standings in this world that would make the citizens of Terrain shiver in terror. However, this young woman had infuriated them all without hesitation.\nThe young lady dashed through the mountain range. Beads of prespiration fell down her face, rolling over her unsightly scars. Every time they did, she would feel a nearly unquenchable desire to itch at her face, but she stubbornly ignored this desire, knowing that such an action would only make it all worse.\n'The beasts in this mountain range will be troublesome. They should give me some time…'\nA serious expression warped the young woman's brows.\nShe flipped her palm, causing a vial filled with a thick, blood red liquid to appear. It was because of this item that she was confident no beast would approach her. But, it was also because of this that she was being hunts like a criminal. Still, if she went through so much trouble fo this vial, she had to take advantage of it too.\nWith another flip of her palm, her opposite hand suddenly gained a familiar ax.\nIf Leonel was there, despite the initial unfamiliarity he had with this young woman's face, he would immediately recognize her now.\nShe was none other than the only woman in his heart, Aina Brazinger.",

      "content": "\"That damned ugly bitch!\"\nA roar shook the forest. It was laced with endless fury and unwillingness. It was the kind of shout that caused birds to flee and an unwitting silence to overwhelm the immediate aftermath.\nAt that moment, a young man stood in the midst of a group of warriors. He had sharp features and a hidden air of elegance beneath his current anger. It was clear that he was very much used to the lifestyle of a noble.\nAt the same time, he wasn't alone in his rage. There were two others of equal standing to his own that felt the same rage toward the same woman.\nOne of them was a young lady whose delicate, expressional features reddened beneath the gnashing of her teeth. And the last was a stocky young man who was a head shorter than even the young woman.\nThese three young masters represented three of the most powerful powers on Terrain. In fact, there were only a handful of other territories that could match them in strength. Yet, they all felt infinite rage toward the same woman.\nThe Cliff's Edge Terrace. The World's End Falls. The Mirage Pavilion.\nEach of these were names that shook the hearts of those born on Terrain. Yet, they had actually made a move together.\n\"Spread out the encirclement. Do whatever you have to do to find her!\"\n\"But… Young Heir, the Mountain Sands Range is too dangerous. If we spread out too thin, it will become too difficult to protect you.\"\nAn older man stepped forward to say these words.\nThe attire from those on Terrain was quite unique. They all wore a cross of robes and soft armor that made their clothing look somewhat like delicate art pieces. However, the truth was that these seemingly soft pieces of cloth provided more defenses than heavy duty armor ever could.\nThe older man and the young master he spoke to both wore deep black robes crossed with dark blue soft armor. The combination made them look somewhat sinister mixed with a touch of an ethereal feel.\nThese robes were the marking of the Cliff's Edge Terrace, a power ranked within the top ten of the Terrain world.\nThe words of the older man was exceptionally tactful. The truth was that the ones that would be in the most danger would be those who separated from this young master of theirs. With all the protective treasures this young man had, even if he was alone in this mountain range, he would still have better than 50% odds of survival.\nHowever, the old man had seen too much life to argue from the point of view of a servant. He had to convince the young man that he would be in danger, otherwise why would he care? This was the reality of the world.\nHearing the name Mountain Sands Range, the young man immediately grew sober.\nIt was an odd name for a mountain range, especially since there were no deserts anywhere within hundreds of kilometers of this place. In fact, when the young man heard that a Tier 1 Bronze Zone would appear in this place, he had been hesitant to go at all until he heard it was a Variant Zone.\nThere were a total of four different kinds of Zones. Regular Zones, Unique Zones, Mythological Zones and finally, Variant Zones.\nVariant Zones were unique in that unlike the others, they didn't pull from culture or history. Rather, they came from the future.\nRegular Zones represented the trials of a world. Unique Zones represented the invasion of a world. Mythological Zones represented the potential of a world. And, Variant Zones represented… the end of a world.\nFor higher Dimensions, toying with the timeline of a weaker world wasn't difficult as long as an appropriate price was paid. However, in this instance, it wasn't another world trying to sabotage Terrain, but rather the future generations of Terrain trying to save their own world.\nWhenever a Variant Zone appeared, it meant that a world had entered a crossroads. Choosing to go one direction or another would decide whether they would sink or swim. A Variant Zone could be considered the universe giving a world a few more chances before they perished.\nOf course, the appearance of just one Variant Zone didn't necessarily mean a world was on the brink of destruction. But, what it did mean was that if appropriate measures weren't taken, a world would be in danger given due time.\nWhat truly differentiated Variant Zone from others was that… treasures could be taken out of them!\nUsually only Gold Zones and above would have this ability. But, only Variant Zones could completely ignore this restriction.\nIt was no wonder, then, that this group was so infuriated. The penultimate treasure of this Variant Zone was snatched away by an unknown young woman. And to make it all worse, she had somehow managed to escape their encirclement.\nHowever, even with all the pent up rage, the young heir still calmed the moment he heard the name…\nThe Mountain Sands Range.\nIt gained this name not because of its terrain, but because of the fact it was a danger zone countless individuals had lost their life in. The legends said that the deeper one entered this mountain range, the more difficult it was to get out, just like quicksand.\nThey had already traveled deeply enough to have entered the so-called 'sand box' region. If they entered too deeply and reached the true 'quicksand' region, even the young heirs wouldn't be confident of escaping.\nHowever, it was clear by the actions of that young woman that she had no intention of escaping outward. In fact, she was putting more pressure on them the deeper she entered.\nThe young heir to the Cliff's Edge Terrace grit his teeth.\nTo pursue or to not pursue. What should he do?\nAfter regaining his calm, he became several levels more thoughtful.\n\"Send out communication talismans. I want to hear from Miss Falls and that short bastard first before we make the next step of the plan.\"\nIn the end, he was the young heir of a great power.. He had initially lost control of his emotions because he couldn't stand the thought of such an ugly woman with no backing causing him to suffer a loss, but now that things had come to this, he had to take the next step carefully.",

      "content": "It wasn't long before a meeting of three had been converged.\nOne was a young man wearing black robes alternating in deep blue soft armor. This young man was the heir of Cliff's Edge Terrace, Reynred Solar.\nThe second was a young woman wearing bright white robes alternating in a light sky blue soft armor. This young woman was the heiress of World's End Falls, Jilniya Falls.\nThe last was a short young man wearing red robes matched with violet soft armor. This young man was the heir of the Mirage Pavilion, Wilas Mirage.\nIf one were to witness this scene, there would only be one of two reactions to have. Either one would be impressed, or disgusted.\nReynred sat in the middle of a dense forest with a tea spread before him. A small round table housed precious herbs being steeped in hot water and delicate, neatly arranged pastries.\nHe sat at the table, one leg crossed over the other, as though he wasn't in the wilderness at all. One would think that he was taking a break of leisure within his own personal garden rather than being on an expedition within one of the most dangerous Danger Zones of Terrain.\n\"Is all of this really necessary, you sissy? You called us here to waste our time eating pastries and drinking tea?\"\nWilas exploded the instant he saw Reynred set up. He and Jilniya both thought that he had already captured that ugly bitch. They had never expected that he would call them here without rhyme or reason. Did he not understand the situation?\nTheir three powers had invested too much into this. Not only had they invested many resources into making sure the opening of the Zone remained secret, but they had lost large amounts of man power forming expeditionary squads to clear a path toward it. What was this fool thinking?\nReynred's hand paused, causing the tea cup in his hands to stop just before his lips. A hint of cold killing intent flashed for just the briefest moment. In the end, he managed to control himself.\n\"We need a better plan than the one we have now. If we continue to follow this ugly woman into this mountain range… I'm sure you know the kind of consequences we could face. This isn't a playground.\"\nHearing these words, both heirs became slightly more serious. Even the perpetually silent Jilniya grew a level more serious.\n\"What do you propose?\" Wilas said after some time.\nReynred took a long sip of his tea before placing the cup down.\n\"There are only four passageways out of this mountain range. Pressure Winds Valley, Reverse Flow River, the Mountain Sands Path and the Mountain Sands cave network.\n\"I think we all know that no one has come out alive from that cave network since the Fourth Dimension descended. I suggest our main forces control these three passageways. As for the fourth, just in case of anything unexpected, we can send a few scouts with decent strength.\n\"That whore isn't very powerful to begin with. If not for her cunning, she would have long since fallen beneath my blade. The moment we lay eyes on her will seal her death.\"\nReynred's gaze turned frosty. He had actually suffered a loss at the hands of a Third Dimension swine. How could he not feel disgusted?\nWilas and Jilniya looked toward one another.\n\"What if she dies? Wouldn't it all be for naught?\" Jilniya finally spoke her first words.\nHer voice was light, delicate, and didn't carry the slightest hint of emotion. She seemed detached from everything. But, then again, it seemed as though all those from World's End Falls were exactly like this.\nReynred sneered. \"In the end, even if it's a Variant Zone, it's still ultimately a mere Tier 1 Bronze Zone. How great could the treasures possibly be?\"\nThe two heirs looked at one another and shook their heads. No matter how one looked at it, Reynred's words simply sounded like sour grapes.\nCompared to other Zones, Variant Zones had exceptionally low difficulty and provided rewards that were disproportionately greater. After all, they were meant to provide hope to a dying world, how could it not be like this?\nIt wasn't surprising for a Tier 1 Bronze Zone to have rewards within in comparable to a Silver Zone. Reynred was just speaking nonsense. However, he was too lost in his own world to care for the opinions. It was clear that his hatred for this young woman had surpassed his desire for this treasure.\nReynred shook his head.\n\"We can't afford to bet our lives here. Those important matters I'm sure you two are aware of aren't as far away as it might seem.\"\nWilas frowned. \"Hmph. The only reason I'll be migrating along with the rest of you is because the elders have already decided on it. I'm not like you shameless individuals who give up so easily.\"\nThis time, it was Wilas' turn to be looked upon oddly. However, they didn't have the mind to say anything to reprimand him. Instead, the meeting dispersed. Soon a net designed to capture one young woman would be perfectly deployed.\n…\nAt that very moment, Aina had entered a cave. If the three heirs had been there, they would have been shocked to realize that this ugly woman they were chasing had actually entered one of the many networks of tunnels beneath the vast mountain range.\nUnfortunately, Aina didn't know anything about the dangers of this place. In truth, after Leonel sent her here with her teleportation ticket, she had appeared not far from the Variant Zone. It was then she entered, not knowing that she would be ruining the plans of so many large powers.\nTeleportation tickets were actually designed such that new comers would be taken to prepared stations. After all, any world that had entered the Fourth Dimension was used to visitors from other worlds. It was a part of evolution.\nHowever, that little fool Leonel didn't know that one had to prepare appropriately for a teleportation as every small factor was important. Namely, Aina's ax had still been in her hand at the time. As a result, it influenced her teleportation and sent her off course.\nIn the end, here she was, being chased to the point of entering these dark caves with nothing to rely on but the ax in her hands.",

      "content": "A heavy breath left Aina's lips.\nThe cold breeze of the damp tunnels nipped at her body, making the portions of her skin exposed to the elements ripple with goosebumps.\nThough she wore the very same black military uniform covered with many pockets, it had been torn in several places due to her battle. Had it not been for her ability, she might very well have been crippled of movement by now.\n'So cold…'\nAina's petite body trembled slightly, but she grit her teeth and pressed onward.\nWithout a choice, she was forced to put her ax away. Using such a large weapon in an enclosed space might cost her her life. So, she pulled out a sword instead.\nThe blade's edge gleamed within the darkness. In her left hand, she clutched the vial of red and the other, she clutched the hilt of her sword.\nShe didn't really think much about her weapon. She had just happened to pick it up within the Variant Zone. However, she wasn't very fond of light weapons, she felt less secure behind such a small weapon.\nAina shook her head, willing these useless thoughts away.\n'Hopefully these tunnels run deep so they won't be able to find me easily. I'll find a place to rest and heal my injuries.'\nAina had no idea what kind of danger zone she was entering. She thought that this place was no different from any normal array of underground tunnels. The only reason she was being semi-cautious was because she wouldn't be naive enough to believe that there were no dangers at all before her.\nNot only were beasts far more advanced on Fourth Dimensional worlds, but Invalids were several levels more dangeorus as well. In fact, there were even instances of Invalids creating and manning civilizations of their own.\nOf course, such a 'civilization' could hardly be called as such. After all, the vast majority of Invalids were mindless zombies. However, Variant Invalids were impossibly dangerous foes. There was a chance, albeit a small one, that there might be Invalids up ahead.\nLuckily, nothing obstructed her path forward. She managed to find several branching paths. After picking one, she chose an area with multiple escape routes and sat down in meditation.\nHer chest heaved, her eyelashes trembling slightly. It was only after she sat that she felt the exhaustion take hold of her body.\nIt had already been several months since the last time she slept. Even Leonel, who had such an overwhelmingly strong spirit, couldn't do such a thing.\nAll this time, she had relied on her ability to accomplish this feat. Whenever she felt overwhelming fatigue, she would activate her self-heal and wash it all away. But, she had been gaining diminishing returns for a long time already.\nAina sighed. 'If he was here…'\nAina suddenly shook her head furiously.\nDuring their time together within the Joan Zone, Aina had gotten used to relying on Leonel's sleep meditation ability. He had always been the perfect scout. But now, there was only herself.\n'Focus, Aina. The moment you decided to take your mask off, you left that life behind.'\nAina snapped her eyes open, willing her fatigue away. She bit down on her lip hard. There was no doubt that if Leonel was here, he would have asked her to treat them better than she was now.\nShe looked down at the red vial in her hand. This vial was the top treasure of the Variant Zone. According to what she understood, it was the blood of a beast known as the Abyss Panther.\nThe Abyss Panther was a Fifth Dimensional beast that would be born on Terrain within the next thousand years. This meant that in all of current existence, the only instance of its existence was currently in Aina's palm. This was the magic of Variant Zones.\nEvery world would birth mystical and powerful beasts of its own after every evolution. Earth would likely have some of its own very soon.\nAmong those evolved beasts, some would grow powerful enough to make a name for itself within the whole universe. Only then would its name ring sonorously within the ears of all.\nHowever, the Abyss Panther wasn't of this level. In fact, it might never be. There was even a chance it would never be born at all and its 'future' lineage would end in Aina's hands right here and now.\nAina hesitated.\nWith this vial in hand, no beast would dare approach her. She basically gained a ring of protection around her. However, if she ingested it now, it would likely bring a huge boost to her strength and smoothly allow her to enter the Fourth Dimension within a few months.\nIf others heard Aina's thoughts, they would think that she was insane.\nThe universe had countless magic systems. One that involved ingesting the blood of powerful beasts, of course, existed. However, this situation was completely different.\nFor one, this was blood from a Fifth Dimensional beast while Aina was still within the Third Dimension. There were a full two watershed moments between her and this beast.\nIn addition, the ingestion of blood was considered to be an unorthodox path. It would always leave behind latent dangers and injuries. Even in the rare instances that it didn't, it would chain a person to a certain level of strength. As such, ingesting blood should never be taken lightly.\nYet, by Aina's demeanor, it seemed that she wasn't worried about any of this. And… this most definitely wasn't due to ignorance.\nAina had reason to be confident.\nHer ability fell under the healing type, yet she wasn't able to heal anyone else but herself. This seemed like a limited and useless ability, however it was actually the exact opposite.\nAina's Gene Assessment listed her as a Five Star Health Professional. Her ability was related to self-healing. Each was related to the other.\nThe reason Aina was so confident was because her ability allowed her almost limitless control over her own body.\nAny benefit she could gain with her body would be multiplied several times over compared to a normal person. She could manipulate the small portions of her body with absolute control.\nIf she ingested this blood, not only could she ensure that there wouldn't be any lingering issues, but she would benefit far more than anyone else who ingested the same blood.\nHowever… this was only part of the reason she dared to do this.",

      "content": "Aina gently touched the scars on her face and winced. They felt exceptionally tender as though they had just healed, but only she knew that she had had these scars for an entire 18 years of her life.\nHer main reliance were these very scars on her face.\n'These scars you've given me, not only will I not let them shame me, I will use them in a way you could never have calculated.'\nA fiery rage lit Aina's amber eyes. In that moment, they flickered like golden flames.\nWithout hesitation, she poured the entire vial contents down her throat.\nBANG!\nAina's clothes were blasted to ash. However, there was no gorgeous sight to behold. What should have been delicate, somewhat tanned skin, was nowhere to be seen.\nAlong with her clothes, Aina's skin had been torn asunder. A rain of her own blood and flesh coated the walls of the cave as though a massacre had taken place. All that was left were the fine fibers of her bloody muscles. In fact, even some of her skeleton shone through regions where even her deep tissue was broken.\nShe looked like a human that had been skinned alive. Yet, somehow, the scars on her face still remained prominent. They were so deep that they dug into the tissue of her face and latched onto her skull. Even in this situation, they pulsed like grotesque worms, not letting go even as their host was on the verge of death.\nHowever, if one looked closely, it seemed that Aina was still in a state of meditation. She no longer had eyelids to close her eyes, but, her pupils seemed to have glazed over.\nAnyone sane would believe that she was dead… That is, until one noticed a steadily beating piece of flesh. It was beneath two large mounds of yellow fat flowing with blood, beneath a? ribcage bathed in crimson, and between two barely perceptibly moving lungs…\nHer heart. It continued to beat with a rhythmic consistency.\nAs time passed, its beating slowed. It seemed that Aina might die at any time, however… though the rhythm seemed to slow, it became deeper and more resounding. Soon, it felt as though the whole underground space was trembling beneath its might.\n…\nAt that moment, in a certain region of Earth, there was a hidden estate. It seemed completely separate from Earth, as though it was a heaven gracing the land of mortals.\nThere were vast stretches of exotic, alien plants, plains were graced by odd creatures of mythology, and the forests held an irresistable scent to them that seemed to pull one into a trance.\nAt the center of this land, there was a mansion that hung in the skies. From its base, thick, heavy chains hung. From a distance, it almost seemed as though these chains were the pillars that held this mansion up. If it wasn't for their slight swaying every so often, any ignorant observer would conclude this as well…\nWithin this mansion, in a room hidden from the eyes of even most of those worthy of stepping foot onto its floors, there was an alter.\nThough it was an alter, it didn't seem to be worshipping anything. Rather, it seemed to be the exact opposite.\nA stone tablet of sort sat with names crossed out, as though being banished from a level of respect they had once deserved, or maybe never deserved to begin with.\nThere were only two names on this list. Both of them seemed to have a magic aura wrapped around them. However, this aura was poison, sinister and dark…\nCompared to the awe inspiring display of the Morales family ancestral grounds, this place was several levels less grand and also lacked any celebratory mood.\nAt that moment, an emanciated old man looked up with dull eyes. He sat within this dark room as a perpetual overseer, but his position didn't seem to be very high. Whether it was his long black robes or the rattling of chains beneath them, he seemed more like a slave than an elder.\nHis eyes were a milky white. He seemed completely blind, yet also seemed to sense something. However, whatever that something was made him sigh.\nBefore he could do much of anything, the pulsing lights on one of the names became more intense. The aura it exuded became several levels more vindictive and savage, exuding an endless dark energy.\nA commotion was raised throughout the mansion and soon news was spread to all corners.\nWithin a room of that mansion, a beautiful middle aged woman sat before a mirror, allowing a petite maid to apply light makeup onto her delicate features. If it wasn't for the slight wrinkles toward the side of her eyes, it would have been impossible to tell this woman's age.\nNot long later, a messenger quickly entered the room and left just as quickly.\nUpon hearing the message, the beautiful middle aged woman snickered.\n\"That whore's daughter is still trying? How many is that already in the last year?\"\n\"38, Madame.\" The petite maid replied softly.\n\"That little bitch sure can endure pain. She should know that that seal isn't going anywhere. She can struggle all she wants, but it won't change the outcome.\"\nThe beautiful middle aged woman's countenance distorted. Her beauty seemed marred by decades of resentment and hatred. She wanted nothing more than for that little bitch to live a life of torment.\nAfter a few moments of silence, she regained her usual air of nobility. It was as though she hadn't been the one to make such an expression just seconds earlier.\n\"Has my boy Simeon still not found their traces? And is there any information about this Leonel Morales who dared to kill the people of my Brazinger Clan?\"\n\"Madame… According to our information, Leonel Morales is the grandson of Emperor Fawkes.\"\nThe beautiful middle aged woman seemed to be stunned for a moment, seemingly not expecting such news. But, after a moment, her gaze narrowed.\n\"And so what? Even if a member of the Fawkes Imperial Family acted, they still have to lose a pound of flesh to my family!\"\nThe petite maid hesitated before continuing.\n\"His mother hasn't been seen in several decades and we weren't able to find out anything about his father. In addition, madame should remember that Young Heir Simeon failed to gain a fourth of the World Spirit…\"\nThough the petite maid didn't finish her words, the meaning was clear. Acting against Leonel with such little information was inadvisable.\nThe beautiful Madame sneered. \"It seems that cheap little whore is just like her mother. They sure know how to pick their men. I don't care what background he has, can it surpass ours? I want him dead before we're swept up by other matters. I don't want a fly buzzing around my business while I'm dealing with those greedy bastards who have eyes on our Fold of Reality.\"\nThe petite maid bowed. \"Yes, Madame.\"\nThe Madame's sneer deepened. Thinking about how that little whore was suffering just to head toward another failure, her heart felt exceptionally light.\n…\nAt that same moment, Aina still sat, her skin peeled completely from her body. However, a sneer also coated what was left of her lips.\nThey probably thought she was struggling to break these seals once again. But, in reality, she was using it to weaken the backlash of this blood. And she would keep using it in this way until the day she could bury that family in the dirt.\nThey wanted to seal her? Well, there was no one in this world who better understood her own body. There was nothing she could put into her body that she couldn't find a way to gain a benefit from.\nHer dull eyes flashed with an endless determination.\n**\nAcross the world, as Aina fought her own battle, Leonel too fought his own.\nBlood covered his body from head to toe, but his gaze was just as blazing as Aina's.\n\"You dare pair yourself with a demonic creature and deem yourself a human?!\" Lamorak billowing roar shook the arena.\nSeveral competitors ran about the surroundings, chasing after orbs of light in the skies.\nLeonel drew his bow, his gaze defiant.\nSHUUUUUUUUUU!\nAnother orb of light was broken apart by him, fusing into his point total.\nLeonel wiped the blood that was falling down from his face.\n\"I've long since been tired of you.\"\nLeonel's voice rumbled like thunder. It didn't seem very loud, yet it reverberated in the chests of all those who heard him.\nHe wanted nothing more than to teach the man before him a lesson.",

      "content": "Just when Leoenl was about to go all out with Lamorak, a familiar voice called out once again.\n<Third Trial Complete>\n<Group 7 Results Calculated>\n<…>\n<Leonel - 302 points>\n<Umred - 212 points>\n<Gawain - 197 points>\n<Cralis - 189 points>\n<Lamorak - 168 points>\n…\nCralis and Umred were both Demon Lords ranked #4 and #2 respectively. Gawain and Lamorak both were Knights of the Round Table. It could be said that Leonel's group for the third trial was among the strongest. To say that he was unlucky was a definite understatement.\nIf it wasn't for this, he wouldn't have been in such a sorry state.\nDuring the second round, he relied on himself to gain a perfect evaluation. However, he had been targeted during this third trial since his marksmanship gave him a great advantage. As a result, he had no choice but to get Little Blackstar's help.\nHe should have known that by doing this, he would have given Lamorak the excuse he needed to target a fellow human. It was no secret to Leonel that the little mink was a Dark Elemental creature. He had expected Lamorak to use such an excuse. But, what he hadn't expected was for the demons to also take the opportunity to target him.\nSurprisngly, the only one who didn't target him was Gawain. Yet, despite this, Umred ranked above him in the end. This made Leonel several points more serious about the Demon Lords. It was clear that not allof them were as weak as the #62 Demon Lord he took the life of just a few months prior.\nLeonel turned toward Umred, trying to catch his breath.\nThe #2 Demon Lord looked like a devil risen from hell. He stood three meters tall and had skin the color of crimson. There were two horns that adorned his head. They pierced? and curled upward menacingly, vibrating with a hidden, dark power.\nUmred's chest was completely bare and his lower half was covered by dark beast skins. He wielded two battle axes, one to each of his massive hands. Their blades seemed as large as his body, dwarfing him despite his size.\nCralis was a demon of large size as well. However, rather than being red, he was covered from head to toe in deep black scales harder than steel. And, rather than wielding battle axes, he wielded a massive broad sword of over three meters in length.\nWhether it was the two demons or the two knights, all of them were looking toward Leonel. Three of them had somewhat reluctant expressions, only Gawain seemed to be expressionless.\nLeonel glared back at them all, his chest heaving up and down. He had already reached the point where just these few had no ability to pressure him any longer.\nWithout another word, he stepped onto his small grey platform and soared back up.\n\"Big Brother, are you okay?\"\nLeonel took a deep breath. \"I'm fine. It's not a big deal.\"\nLittle Nana frowned at these words. She could tell from the tone of Leonel's voice that he wasn't as fine with these matters as it seemed.\nToward such a reaction, Nana couldn't help but feel somewhat speechless. What was it? Did he expect to not suffer a loss after being targeted by so many powerful beings? In fact, did he even really suffer such a loss? Wasn't he still first?\nHowever, Nana had no idea that the reason Leonel was so short and succinct wasn't because of this. Though it played a part, it wasn't everything.\nAt the moment, Leonel had an uncomfortable, suffocating feeling in his chest. It was the kind of feeling he only felt due to Aina.\nFor some reason, Leonel felt as though there was something wrong with Aina at this very moment. Yet, he was still years away from leaving these trial grounds. And, even if he left right now, it would be impossible for him to find her immediately.\nThis left him feeling anxious, so anxious that he didn't even think about why he was so certain these thoughts were reality.\nIt was no wonder, then, that Leonel almost completely snapped just a moment ago. If it wasn't for the trial ending, there was no telling what he would have done in that moment.\n<Trial Grade: Perfect>\n<Skill Points Rewarded: 3020>\n<Special Reward: 1 Special Star Ticket. 3 Star Points>\n<Perfect Grade Recovery Rewarded>\nA pillar of gold descended upon Leonel. He had no choice but to discard any distracting thoughts he had. Even if he wanted to rush to Aina right now, he couldn't do so without strength. If he wasted this time, any small chance he had would just shrink all the more so.\nStar Force rotated within Leonel's body. As time passed, he felt his Force growing more and more crystallized.\n'Just a little more… Just a little more and I'll be able to form my final Nodes.'\nEach recovery reward Leonel gained was worth three to four months of normal meditation. After two perfect recovery rewards in a row, Leonel had already managed to cover over half a year of meditation. With a few more rewards like this, he would be able to meet his goal.\n\"Nana, come over here.\"\nA sudden voice sounded as Leonel opened his eyes. He didn't need to look over to know that it was Pope Margrave. Before Leonel could even react to the words, the first thing he noticed was Nana's imperceptible trembling. It was as though she was deep within a nightmare.\nSeeing Nana's hesitation, Margrave frowned.\n\"Did you not hear me?\"\nThe dignity in his voice raised several levels. Despite the fact he didn't raise its volume, it felt as though his words were thundering in the little girl's ears, causing her blood to rush in reverse.\nLittle Nana's hands gripped at her chest. It looked like she would bend to the pressure at any moment.\nAt this instant, the eighth round of the third trial was beginning, but at least half of the remaining participants had suddenly turned their gazes toward their direction.\nHowever, no one could have expected Leonel's reaction.\n\"I'm not in the best of moods right now, Pope.. Scram.\"",

      "content": "Leonel wasn't a person who got pushed to anger easily. Even when he was oppressed several times by Camelot or even the powers he had been a part of in the past, being vicious with his words wasn't normally the route he would take.\nHis usual response would be calm and collected, even to the point of bordering on inhumanly cold. But now, after swallowing several grievances, being targeted by the very people he was meant to save in this damned Zone, and now seeing a little girl being so blatantly bullied before so many…. He snapped.\nHe looked toward the handsome Pope Margrave, his hair billowing beneath his own aura.\nMargrave's gaze narrowed.\nThough Leonel had called him Pope, it didn't carry a hint of respect. And, as if the disrespect wasn't enough… he actually told him to scram?\nMargrave remained silent for several moments. The motives for his actions were quite obvious. He was the Pope of The Church while Leonel just revealed that his beast companion was a demon beast. How could he allow one of his own people to interact with such a man?\nModred looked over with a hint of curiosity in her eyes. There was even a hint of understanding and compassion within them, as if she understood Leonel's plight. But, just as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared just as fast.\nMargrave didn't respond to Leonel directly and turned back toward Nana.\n\"Are you sure this is what you want?\"\nHis words seemed to be hinting at something. Yet, only Nana herself seemed to understand. Everyone else was completely left in the dark.\nLittle Nana's trembling grew fiercer. It became quite obvious to Leonel that this wasn't just a matter of being associated with him.\nWhile others might not know it, Leonel knew that Nana wasn't of this world. In a few years, this Pope would have no control over her life whatsoever. So, while others who heard their conversation assumed that the Pope was an elder advising Nana for the sake of her future, Leonel knew that she wouldn't react like this if it was just about that…\nLeonel stood up and stepped into the void that separated his and Nana's platform. It seemed like he was committing suicide for a moment, yet in the next instant, he actually took a step on the air, shocking all those who were watching him.\nOf course, Leonel was using his treasure shoes to mimic such an effect, but the others had no way of knowing this.\nLittle Nana was so shaken that she hardly noticed when Leonel had already appeared before her. If it wasn't for his shadow, she would have noticed anything at all.\n\"Ah…!\"\n\"Do you want to leave here?\" Leonel asked.\n\"Ah…\" Little Nana was speechless.\nIf she could leave, wouldn't she have? What was Leonel saying? She was confused about exactly what was happening.\n\"Do you?\" Leonel pressed.\n\"Y-yes…\"\n\"Good.\"\nLeonel nodded. Then, he brought out the Segmented Cube and allowed her to enter. In one instant, there was nothing but a small gray platform and two youngsters. In the next, there was no one but Leonel standing outside of a large five by five meter box. In fact, the cube was so large that Leonel was able to step from it to his original grey platform without using his treasure shoes.\nPope Margrave's brow furrowed.\nWhat was this supposed to accomplish?\nHow could Pope Margrave know of the Segmented Cube's abilities? Entering it was like being disconnected from the world entirely.\nDuring the second trial, Leonel had had thoughts of entering the Segmented Cube. But, something made him rethink doing so and he asked the dictionary about it first.\nAs expected, once he entered the Segmented Cube, he would be considered to have left the Merlin Trials. If he did that, he would lose the right to fight for the Four Seasons Realm comprehension.\nHowever, for someone like Little Nana, this was perfect for her. She would no longer be restrained by the trials. But, from now until the trials ended, she would have to remain within the Segmented Cube. There was no telling how the trial grounds would react to a 'dead' participant suddenly coming back.\nLeonel landed on his own platform, his chest heaving slightly. This was the first time that his recovery didn't bring him back to 100%. However, this only made sense. He had directed all of the Star Force toward concentrating his Force.\nIn addition, for whatever reason, Leonel seemed unaware that he had already awakened the Healing Branch of his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor. If not for this, how could he ever worry about his body's condition? How could he ever have been put into such a sorry state just moments ago?\nIt seemed that Leonel had truly been unconscious during the matters of that day…\nAfter landing, Leonel turned back toward the Pope only to see that the latter was already looking toward him. However, Leonel disregarded him the very same way he had once disregarded Leonel.\nThis time, though, the Pope didn't seem intent on maintaining his silence toward Leonel.\nHe sighed. \"Are you not aware that your actions have made an enemy of all those here?\"\nLeonel's footsteps paused. If it wasn't for his mood, he may very well have laughed at what he had just heard.\nHe was a Leonel Morales. He was a man who, despite his modest upbringing, managed to gain the love and adoration of a school filled with nobles.\nWho among those who went to Royal Blue Academy didn't know his name? Who among them didn't respect him and have a good opinion of him? Even when he 'shamed' himself and never missed a day of confessing to Aina, not a soul made fun of him for it and they even encourage him.\nYet, after the world changed, everything seemed to change along with it. It seemed that no matter where he went or what he did, he would be hated, ostracized, and targeted. It was as though after the new world order descended, his charisma, his kind heart, his warm nature… it all wasn't worth a single shit anymore.\nThinking to this point, Leonel began to laugh, unable to hold it back. He genuinely laughed, finding it all to be very funny.\n\"Then be my enemy.\" Leonel said after he finished laughing.\nHe didn't say any other words and his tone even seemed somewhat sad. But that was all. He didn't spare the Pope another glance.\n<Third Trial Complete>\n<Group 8 Results Calculated>\n<Random Event Triggered>\n<70% or more of those participating have gained animosity toward one trial taker [Leonel].

      "content": "Leonel's expression changed. This was the last thing he could have possibly expected to happen. However, after a while, he understood why such a thing would happen.\nThe Merlin Trials were set up with the utmost transparency. With the exception of hiding what happened within the Special Store, everything else was laid bare for all to see. Whether it was one's performance and grade or even the skills one chose to unlock, everyone saw it.\nBeyond this transparency, one could watch everyone battle. This was especially so in single participant trials like trial 1 and 2 had been. In that case, even when one waited to unlock skills after using a Special Store Ticket, it was more likely than not that whatever improvements one made would become very obvious, very quickly.\nAs though this wasn't enough, everyone shared the same physical root skill tree. In addition, all those who used the same weapon shared the same weapon root and special root skill trees as well. This meant that even if one wanted to hide their skills and did a good job in doing so, the kind of skills one had unlocked could be deduced just by observing someone else with a similar weapon!\nWhat did this all come to mean? It essentially meant that this set up made it very easy to distinguish who was powerful and who wasn't, in addition to who was improving faster than others and who wasn't.\nIn such a situation, a small group of individuals becoming the target of many was very possible. One could even say that it was inevitable. The only question was of when.\nUnderstanding this, Merlin would have definitely made some plans accordingly. Or, maybe this was always Merlin's intention to begin with.\n'It feels as though everything is suddenly moving quicker. Whether it was the sudden Elimination Round or this Random Event, both were triggered by something that should have only begun to happen much later in the trials…'\nAfter thinking to this point, Leonel became several points more serious. Though the voice had said that he had 10x the rewards to claim, he knew that doing so wouldn't be so easy.\nBefore Leonel could think anymore, he felt the world warp around him. When his vision cleared, he found himself in a familiar throne room. Except this time, rather than kneeling before it as he had done last time, he was sitting on its cushioned seat.\n'King Arthur's Throne Room?'\nLeonel frowned. He felt that this positioning wasn't much of a coincidence.\nAfter a sweep of his senses, Leonel realized that though he was within Camelot's castle, it was completely deserted. In fact, for as far as he could stretch his Internal Sight, he didn't spot a single person.\n<Preparation Time Given: 00:30:00>\nLeonel was pleasantly surprised. He hadn't thought that he would gain something like that. This made things much more convenient for him.\nAfter a while, Leonel understood the Random Event.\nThere was a flag in this very throne room. In fact, it was waving above the throne he sat on at this very moment. His role was to protect it, while the role of everyone else was to steal it.\nLeonel had to protect the flag for a single day. However, should the flag be stolen away, it only had to be protected by the opposition for ten minutes. The only exception to this is if there was less than ten minutes remaining to the end of the trial. In that case, they only had to protect it until time ran out. This essentially meant that the most dangerous time for Leonel to lose the flag would be in the final minutes.\nOf course, the reason Leonel wasn't in too bad of a position was because he could move the flag if he wanted to. The only restriction was that since the chosen location was Camelot, he couldn't leave the city walls. In fact, from Leonel's understanding, he had to stay within the core city's gates as well. However, this was still a large area.\n'Run?'\nLeonel's lips curled, a cold light suffusing his eyes.\nIn order to participate in capturing his flag, Leonel's enemies had to pay 1 star point or 1000 skill points. This way, most were filtered out. However, it also guaranteed that all who dared to do so would be elites.\nAt the same time, the more who participated, the better his rewards would be.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nLittle Blackstar jumped up from Leonel's shoulders to the top of his head. Previously, the little guy had felt quite enraged about how Leonel was being treated and had even wanted to charge out to face their enemies directly. However, Leonel had stopped the little guy from doing so. Though the little mink was powerful, Leonel was sure Blackstar was still an infant. He couldn't let him rush to his death like that.\n\"Yes, yes. We'll get them back now. Giving an Earth Mage time to prepare their own terrain? They should expect to suffer a few losses…\"\nLeaving such an advantage to an Earth Mage was bad enough. But, Leonel wasn't just an Earth Mage… He was an Earth Magus who also happened to be a Force Crafter.\nThe moment Leonel had this thought, he began to use the over 3000 skill points he had? just gained without thought for conservation.\n**\nThe 30 minute timer ran its course.\nAt that moment, several individuals turned their gaze toward the Segmented Cube Leonel had left behind. However, none of them had the ability to cross the skies like Leonel had. Or, maybe some of them did, but had yet to unlock such an ability from the physical root skill tree and could only watch it.\nUnfortunately for them, there wasn't much time to think about just what this treasure was or how it worked. They were all given the same option.\n<Would you like to enter the Random Event?>\n<Cost: 1 star point>\nIn that instant, several elites made their decisions and disappeared along with Leonel.\nWhen they reappeared, they found themselves within the walls of Camelot. The sun hung high in the sky.\nFor them, who had been within the trials for the last few months, seeing such a sight was actually quite refreshing. But, after a few moments, they grew serious. This wasn't the time to be losing themselves in thought.\nThey had all spawned in random locations, stretched across the core city of Camelot. No two individuals could be found within a hundred meters of one another. Now, they just had to make the decision of where to look for Leonel first.\nLuckily, they were all elites. The prerequisite to cultivate Force was to grasp Internal Sight. Even if they all had varying degrees of how strong their own were, they all at least had Internal Sight capable of covering a few tens of meters. The more powerful of them could cover several hundred meters.\nThe truth was that if Leonel wanted, he could hide himself from their search. After all, that was how he had escaped Camelot initially. He had been able to avoid Lamorak's detection and simply walked out.\nHowever, while he could do, he didn't feel that it was necessary. At least not for now. This was the perfect chance for him to gain slaughter points.\nBy now, Leonel had learned the benefit of saving and not using his slaughter points immediately. From being worth 100 skill points, they were already worth 1000. If he saved them well, the benefit could be imagined.\nAs the elites looked for Leonel, they seemed to realize that this might have become more difficult than they originally thought.\nIn a corner of the city, Umred frowned. The action made his already sinister crimson features all the more so.\n'He can hide from Internal Sight?'\nThis was the first thought the #2 Demon Lord had. However, it wasn't a thought he wanted to confirm. If this was true, finding Leonel truly would be impossible.\n'Hm?'\nUmred's expression chain, his twin battle axes trembling slightly as he seemed to realize something. He didn't immediately sense Leonel, but what he did sense was a faint fluctuation of magic.\nHe looked toward the castle with a slight hint of shock.\nThe reason he was shocked wasn't because the magic fluctuations were powerful. But rather because of their location. These fluctuations were actually coming from Camelot's castle.\nAs a demon, he had never stepped foot so close to Camelot's core. However, he knew a castle when he saw one. The fact that these fluctuations were coming from the very center of this city… it can't be that Leonel hadn't been running and hiding like they thought?\nWhile Umred was having these thoughts, so were many others.\nSurprisingly, neither King Arthur nor Modred had chosen to take part. In fact, Pope Margrave, who Leonel thought likely had the highest chance of taking action, hadn't moved either.\nThat said, there were still some familiar faces. Aside from the crimson Umred, there was the black scaled Cralis and even the large bellied Big Buddha…\nAll at once, these three seemed to realize the very same thing.\nBig Buddha looked toward the castle with a dark expression.\nHe had once had a great impression of Leonel. This was a youth that had saved many of their promising geniuses, after all. However, ever since Leonel said those words about the Slayer Legion, his opinion of Leonel had only plummeted day after day. These emotions reached their peak when he watched so many of their own die.\nMountain… He was a youth that Big Buddha saw a lot of himself in. Mayfly… She was a cheerful little girl with a big heart and had even been among those who went to take Leonel out of the Project Hunt Island.\nYet, all of them had died here.\nIt was Leonel's fault. Had he not been unreasonable and caused so much chaos, the Adurna family would have never grasped the chance to enter the Zone and their team would have been whole and complete. But, because of his own selfish desires, he actually caused the death of so many.\nBig Buddha's gaze turned red, his steps causing the ground to rumble as he entered the castle before him.",

      "content": "Big Buddha frowned when he entered the castle. He immediately realized that there wasn't a single other soul. But, by his estimations, this didn't make sense. He most definitely wasn't the most powerful of those who had chosen to participate. By all rights, he logically shouldn't have been the first to reach this point.\nHe suddenly felt like something was wrong. The cold stone beneath his feet, the eerie works of art that hung from the tall walls and windows, the knight statues decorated with immaculate armor… It all felt too quiet, too disconcerting.\nLittle did Big Buddha know that there were several individuals feeling the exact way he did.\nThey all stood in the very same hall Big Buddha did, staring at the same eerie walls, feeling the same stifling weight on their chests, but none of them sensed the other. It was as though they were on different planes of existence, viewing the same things from a completely different perspective.\nLeonel sat within the throne room, coldly watching these events. He was both surprised and disappointed to see Big Buddha taking part. Others might not be aware, but weren't they both here to complete the same mission? What did he gain by targeting him like this?\nLeonel sighed and shook his head. He looked off blankly into the distance for a moment.\nThis world… why was it like this?\nSomething faint budded within Leonel's heart, but he wasn't in the mood to grasp it. He simply wanted this to end.\n\"Let's go, Little Blackstar.\"\nLeonel took a step forward and was suddenly shrouded by shadows.\n…\nZyllee was a Demon Lord ranked #19. He could be considered to have made a name for himself a long time ago.\nHe had a hook nose that seemed displaced from a large beaked bird and two sharp hawk-like eyes. What was most surprising about him, though, was the fact he was one of the rare bowman who had chosen to take part in the trials.\nZyllee's steps were slow and silent. He crossed over one step at a time, leaving his body in a ready position to fire his nocked arrow in short notice.\nJust from his movement alone, Leonel could learn many things. It was clear that while Leonel's talent was several levels beyond his own, the one with more experience and training was clear at a single glance.\nUnlike Big Buddha, Zyllee wasn't surprised by the fact he was the only one here. He was confident in his own tracking and sensory abilities. There were very few things that could hide from his hawk-like eyes.\nHowever, it was for this very reason that though he seemed cautious, he was the one with his guard the most lowered. In fact, he could even spare thoughts toward the kind of rewards he would gain for killing Leonel.\nSure, the goal was only to capture the flag. But, wouldn't the game end much quicker if he just killed his only opponent? Why waste ten minutes running away if things could be ended so easily?\nZyllee licked his lips, revealing a long brownish-red tongue covered in bumps and sinkholes. It looked more like a piece of aged skin rather than someone's tongue.\nOut of habit, the tip of his tongue swung past his nose, picking at both his nostrils.\n\"Hehe, I can see you!\"\nZyllee suddenly spoke, his head whipping around in the direction he had sensed movement. But, all he found was a corpse falling down toward him.\nSuch a realization shocked him to the point that he hardly registered an arrow aimed through the body and toward his heart.\nIn the end, Zyllee was still a veteran of the battlefield. While it was clever to use a body to cover an attack, it was also inevitable that said attack would be slowed after passing through such an obstacle. This gave Zyllee plenty of time to react.\nThe hawk-nosed demon dove out of the way of the corpse, rolling along the ground before propping himself up on a knee. Without even standing up, he was already prepared to fire an arrow.\nUnfortunately…\nBANG!\nThe corpse exploded. A ran of metallic shrapnel barraged the #19 Demon Lord.\nZyllee had focused his entire being on aiming his first shot. He had thought that Leonel's attack was finished the moment the corpse fell and didn't even bother to move away from it. Little did he know that the corpse that fell by his feet would be the true attack.\nAn entire side of Zyllee's face was bombarded by shrapnel, causing his already unpleasant features to become even more ghastly.\nZyllee's vision swam. He could already feel his consciousness slipping away as his body bled out.\nHe never even got the chance to hit the ground when an arrow shot through his forehead.\n'… You couldn't have at least… checked if I was dead first…?'\nZyllee died with grievances. Though he had been hurt by the initial strike, it hadn't been to the point of dying so soon. He was severely injured, but as a demon, he could have fought another round or two before his life truly slipped away.\nWho could have expected that Leonel wouldn't even speak a word before sealing his fate completely? Any thoughts he had of luring Leonel into a false sense of security before counter attacking was completely disregarded as his eyes grew dull.\n…\nAt that moment, another Demon was slowly exploring the castle, trying to find exactly where Leonel was hiding.\nHis steps paused, his large body becoming frighteningly still.\nHis nose tilted up into the air, a large pair of fiery red nostrils taking a deep breath.\n'Blood…'\nThe demon's eyes narrowed.\nIt could be said that Leonel's means were quite clever.\nTaking advantage of the fact his enemies didn't enter at the same time, he used a few illusions of the eyes and senses to separate them and deal with them one by one.\nHe managed to isolate sight, hearing and Internal Sight. However… he didn't manage to do so with scent.\nIt wasn't necessarily Leonel's fault. A human wouldn't be able to pick up the scent of blood from so far away. In fact, not all demons had a strong sense of smell either.\nBut… it just so happened that Umred did.",

      "content": "Leonel steadied his breathing.\nNot every battle had been as simple as the one against Zyllee. Many were more cautious and sometimes Leonel's plans didn't work out as perfectly as they did in his mind. But, regardless, Leonel had already gained 7 slaughter points. Five of which came from demons and the remaining two of which were humans. Now, there were only three left, Big Buddha, Umred and Cralis.\nLeonel felt that there were more who had entered this trial, but, it seemed that their senses hadn't been sharp enough to come to the castle.\nThis was already the best result possible. Leonel didn't want to make it too obvious that he was here. If he did, those who were powerful would realize that it was a trap. In that case, it was best to miss out of luring everyone if it meant capturing all of the big fish.\nLeonel took a deep breath.\n'Of the three that remain the weakest is…'\nLeonel sighed. He had been subconsciously putting off confronting Big Buddha. In truth, several of those he had already killed were more powerful than the large bellied Commander.\nLeonel knew that he was still too soft hearted, even now. But, there was nothing much he could do about his own disposition.\nAll of his kills up to this point were strangers or those he hardly knew. Big Buddha could be considered to be the first person he would kill that he had once had a decent relationship with.\nEven thinking this, Leonel felt silly. After all, this so-called 'decent' relationship was just a matter of conversing with this larger than life man for a couple hours, if that. But, Leonel still felt that it would cause a knot in his heart.\nLeonel closed his eyes and took another deep breath.\n'He's trying to kill you.'\nThese were the only words Leonel whispered to himself. They were words no one else would ever hear, but he repeated them to himself again and again.\nLeonel's eyes remained closed for a long while as he calmed his heart. When they opened again, his calculating gaze had returned.\n'Get ready, Little Blackstar.'\nLeonel sent his thoughts over to the little mink. After unlocking 'Perfect Union', doing such a thing wasn't an issue. Though the little mink and him couldn't communicate in the truest sense, it was possible for them to understand each other's intentions as though it was their own. In a way, their ability to understand one another was even better than if they used words and it was also much quicker as well.\nLeonel shot forward, his steps exceptionally light.\nOne of the benefits this trial had given him was an understanding of movement. Leonel had never really considered its importance before.\nOriginally, he had been entirely focused on just improving his movement speed. The restrictions within the trial were so great that he felt stifled. After all, ever since he awakened his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor, speed had become one of his strong points.\nHowever, after unlocking the skills within his physical roots, Leonel began to realize that movement was more complex than he once thought. It wasn't always strictly about straight-line speed. In many ways, agility was even more important than pure speed.\nIt wasn't just about speed, but how he fused a myriad of changes to his movement.\nLeonel was a marksman. It could be said that this was the path he was by far the most talented in. As a result, he knew how easy it was for him to hit a target with a predictable path. It was to the point where he would never miss such a target.\nBut, what if said target not only had speed, but also an enigmatic method of using it?\nWhen Leonel used his Dream World to simulate such things, he realized that even without improving his power by much, if all he did was focus on his movement technique, his lethality was increase by 100% if not more.\nKnowing this, Leonel realized two things. First, he realized that when he left this place, he should use one of his rewards on a movement type technique. They were far more important than he had given them credit for. And the second thing was that he realized his best bet at this juncture was to pour all of his skill points into his physical root skill tree.\nAll 3020 of his previous earned points had gone exactly there.\n<Silver Skill 'Explosive First Step' Chosen>\n<Silver Skill 'Abrupt Stop' Chosen>\n…\n<Gold Skill 'Irregular Steps' Chosen>\nLeonel streaked across the castle, appearing where Big Buddha was in a flash.\nAs though to stop himself from hesitating, he didn't pause for a single moment. With a single motion, his palm flipped, causing a corpse he had kept within his spatial bracelet to launch toward the large man.\nBig Buddha had long since grown impatient. He had been looking everywhere for where Leonel might be, but had found nothing. In addition, it was obvious that Leonel was fine, or else the Random Event would have come to an end already. Yet, all this time, he hadn't heard anything. He couldn't help but grow anxious.\nIt was at the moment he was thinking of backtracking and leaving the castle entirely that he suddenly realized the same thing Zyllee had just moments later… A corpse was coming toward him.\nBig Buddha's eyes widened. However, he managed to react reflexively.\nHis palms were suddenly coated by a massive energy. In the blink of an eye, that energy seeped into his flesh, expanding the size of his hands until they rivaled his massive body in size. On the surface, his ability seemed somewhat comical. But, in practice, it carried a devastating power.\nBig Buddha slammed a palm forward, not holding back in the slightest.\nBANG!\nA shower of shrapnel assaulted Big Buddha. However, his palms were so large that his attack acted as a defense at the same time. Though bits of hard metal sank into his palm, a strong reflective energy blasted them away before he could suffer any real injury.\n\"LEONEL!\" Big Buddha roared.\nHe was completely enraged to the point of being irrational. He seemed to have completely forgotten that he had come here to kill Leonel.\nHowever, Leonel had already set his mind to the task. There was no way he would allow Big Buddha the time to rest, nor would he allow himself the time to hesitate and regret his actions. Aina had told him once before… to be kind to your enemies was to be unkind to yourself.\nLeonel pinched two arrows between three fingers, nocking them both at once and activated the Silver Skill 'Double Shot'.\nSHUUUUU!\nLeonel's arrows twirled around one another in the air. At first, their spiral seemed separate. But in the next instant, they seemed to fuse, becoming a spinning corkscrew of Force in the air.\n\"AGH!\"\nA large finger was severed before Big Buddha could react. It flailed in the air before dissipating the energy that formed it and hitting the ground at its normal size.\nUnfortunately for Big Buddha, Leonel's gaze remained cold and calculating.\nLeonel activated the Silver Skill 'Hot Streak', eliminating his cool downs for the next 10 seconds. Then, he immediately activated the Silver Skill 'Five Pronged Net'.\nHe fired five arrows in quick succession. Each curled in the air from five different directions, firing toward Big Buddha from five separate directions at once.\nBig Buddha panicked, swatting his two massive palms to the left and right, smashing apart 'Five Pronged Net' before it could form.\nUnfortunately… that exposed his front.\nThe Silver Skill 'Shooting Star' activated.\nLightning crackled and wind sliced. Leonel's gaze met Big Buddha's. Though his heart shook when he saw the fear and helplessness, his steady hand never wavered.\nSHUUUUU!\nLeonel's expression suddenly changed. He retreated with his quickest steps, not forsaking his Light Elemental Force for a even a moment.\nA battle ax suddenly smashed down from his side. However, there was no owner behind it. It was clear that it had been thrown toward him. Had he not moved, his arms which had just been holding up his bow would have been severed.\nHowever, it was fine. He had already released the arrow. Regardless, Big Buddha would die.\nAt least, that's what Leonel thought before a second variable appeared.\nA massive broad sword smashed into one of Big Buddha's palms, sending him flying to the side.\nBig Buddha slid along the ground in a sorry state. It was clear that whoever had 'saved' him hadn't really cared about his well being because he seemed to be barely alive. It was as though their goal was to prevent Leonel from gaining more slaughter points rather than saving a comrade.\nLeonel's expression grew heavy. He recognized those two weapons.\nUmred and Cralis had managed to see through his maze of spells.",

      "content": "Leonel didn't have time to think about why it was that these two demons managed to find him. However, he realized one thing instantly: they had been stalking him.\nBefore Leonel made the choice to target anyone, he first checked in on where everyone was. If they were too close to one another, he wouldn't even take the risk of attacking.\nAll of the spells he had written could be walked directly through, there were no physical obstructions. As a result, crossing over from one region to another was not only easy, but seamless. This was how Leonel managed to maintain the illusion that his enemies were always alone. If there were physical obstructions, it would become too obvious, too quickly that he was interfering with their senses. Once that happened, everything would be exposed.\nThis was all to say that the last time Leonel checked on these pair of Demon Lords, they were several hundred meters away. Leonel was certain that he could kill Big Buddha in time. The only explanation for how they both made it here so coincidentally was that they were lurking and waiting for him to enter battle so that they could counter.\n'Hot Streak is still active.'\nLeonel's mind spun quickly. Since he dared to do this, how could he not have contingency plans? He just needed an opportunity to use them.\n'Little Blackstar.'\nLeonel activated the Silver Skill 'Double Shot' again. This time, he aimed for Cralis. He didn't really have any other choice. Since Umred had thrown over his ax, it meant that he was still a small distance away. Leonel didn't even bother to send his senses over to lock onto him, he only needed to deal with the problem in front of him.\nCralis blocked the corkscrewing arrows with the flat of his massive broad sword, sliding back beneath the strength of the impact.\nUnfortunately for him, due to having to save Big Buddha, he was outside his own attack range. But, all he had to do was hold on. Not only was Umred on his way, but he knew that Leonel couldn't quick fire at this rate indefinitely. This was definitely the skill 'Hot Streak', it would last at most ten seconds.\nLeonel unleashed a barrage of arrows. All of them were simple normal 'Single Shots', however they were all reinforced, crackling with strong amounts of lightning.\nAs he did so, he explosively retreated, not allowing Umred to surround him.\n'It's done.'\nCralis' shot forward, his broad sword trailing behind him like the tail of a flying kite. His black scales shimmered beneath the low light of the castle, bouncing off his body like droplets of water.\nHis speed was unbelievably fast. Leonel couldn't help but wonder again how it was that Cralis and Umred weren't among the two who gained perfect evaluations for the first trial. But, whatever the reason was, the pressure they could place on Leonel now after benefiting greatly from the second and third trial was enough to make his hair stand on end.\nLeonel's expression changed once more.\nAnother sharp wind assaulted his back. Leonel didn't need to turn back to know that it was Umred's second battle ax.\nLeonel couldn't help but be shocked. Umred had actually thrown both of his weapons?\nWith a firm plant, Leonel dove to one side.\n'I timed it perfectly.' Leonel's gaze narrowed.\nLeonel thought that Cralis would be obstructed by Umred's throw, allowing him a chance to slip away. However, a fleeting thought crossed him mind that made his expression change once again.\nHe was certain that he had retreated in the opposite direction of where Umred's initial ax came from. So, how had another ax suddenly come from his back?\nNow that Leonel thought about it, he initially gave up on locking onto Umred with his Internal Sight because he couldn't immediately find him. Though his maze of spells was very helpful in separating his enemies and allowing him to deal with them one at a time, it also hindered himself.\nIn order to circumvent this problem, Leonel used visual arrays that could project the happenings to him, that way he could maintain control of the entire situation but…\nLeonel clenched his jaw. 'Visual arrays are easily fooled…'\nLeonel felt that he had stepped into a pile of shit. Who said Demons couldn't use their heads?\nAll of these thoughts flashed by Leonel's mind in a split second. He still had one advantage in all of this. His thinking speed was so quick that he saw through the plan of the pair of Demon Lords before it was even revealed.\nThe more information he had and the earlier he got it, the faster he could make adjustments.\nIn that instant, the ax veered off course, curling around Cralis as though it had autonomy of its own.\n'That's the Silver Special Skill 'Weapon Control'.'\nLeonel understood what happened now.\nUmred had used 'Weapon Control' to fake the direction he was truly in, essentially blocking off a lane of retreat for Leonel while leading him to where he really was.\nHowever, the real plan wasn't to hit him with this second ax, but to make him think that Cralis would be stalled, thus giving them time to pincer him. Umred banked on him being confused for just long enough not to realize that he was using 'Weapon Control', thus causing him to make an error in judgement.\nHowever, Leonel was ready. Rather than trying to escape like the two expected, Leonel fired an arrow from a single knee, aiming right for Carlis' head.\nThe #4 Demon Lord was stunned, not expecting Leonel to make such a choice. He had been preparing an attack to catch Leonel off guard this whole time, how could he also defend at the same time?\nWithout an option, Carlis twisted his body, dodging to one side. However, it wasn't enough. Leonel was too close and his arrows were simply too fast.\nSHUUUU! PCCHUU!\nAn arrow ripped through Carlis' black scales, tearing into his collarbone and just barely missing Carlis' throat.\nIn that instant, Leonel took the chance to explosively retreat once again, avoiding Umred's pincer.\nLeonel took deep breaths, his bow primed and his arrow nocked. Beads of sweat fell from his brow as he watched Umred's battle axes float toward empty space.\nIn the next moment, a large three meter tall crimson demon with savage horns stepped out, crossing a spell wall Leonel had put up to appear.",

      "content": "Leonel steadied his breathing, his gaze narrowing.\nHad he been just a bit slower, he would have been forced to take on an attack from the front and the back simultaneously. Taking on such an attack from two such powerful individuals would be like asking for death.\nAt the same time that Leonel was steadying his quickly beating heart, the two Demon Lords were looking toward him with exceptionally serious expressions. They didn't know if Leonel had lucked out or if he had seen through their plan in such dire straits, but if it was the latter… it was simply too monstrous.\nThere weren't many who could remain calm in the midst of battle. But, remaining calm and analyzing the situation so quickly was something straight out of a fantasy novel. There were those who could make appropriate actions like Leonel's on instinct honed through countless years of battle. But… Leonel was simply too young to have cultivated a battle sense of that level.\nThe little mink grew restless seeing these two. These were the same two demons that had been bullying Leonel during the third trial. The moment the little guy recognized them, he bared his little fangs, growling. Though, due to his small size, Little Blackstar's growling sounded more like the purring of a kitten than the prowling call of a predator.\n'Alright, alright little guy.'\nLeonel smiled, somehow feeling more at ease after seeing Blackstar's antics.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nLeonel's gaze became more serious as he looked back toward the two Demon Lords.\n'No, let me fight them on my own for now…'\nA small circle of wind surged around Leonel, his eyes becoming somewhat dull.\nSince he began these trials, he had yet to get a chance to test his own hypotheses. He originally wanted to see if it was feasible to use his Dreamscape in place of his battle sense. What better opportunity was there than now?\nAs his gaze became dull, the entire battlefield was projected into his Dream World. A replica of himself stood, as did one of both Umred and Cralis.\nEverything before him was broken down into numbers and percentages. They flickered by his eyes like the words on a screen, his mind becoming faster and faster with each passing moment.\nThe two Demon Lords suddenly felt their hair stand on end. They felt an overwhelming sense of danger for a moment, but they had no idea where it was coming from. Did this boy get help? But that was impossible, this was a trial set up by Merlin himself.\nBefore the two could truly understand what was happening, Leonel took a step forward, firing a simple arrow.\nIt was just a simple arrow, but Umred felt stifled. The step he had planned to take was suddenly cut off. He had no choice but to change his tactics midway, but the result was a taboo in battle. He thought too much about his next move, making his reactions slow.\nIn the end, he could only hurriedly block with his two axes in a sorry fashion, stumbling backward due to his base not being solid.\nCralis watched this happened with an incredulous gaze. At first, he thought that Leonel and Umred were teaming up to put a show. Could it be that Umred planned on using Leonel to get rid of him?\nHe definitely didn't put such an action past the #2 Demon Lord. After all, they were demons. Plotting, scheming, and backstabbing one another could be considered just another event of the day.\nHowever, in the next instant, he realized that it wasn't Umred scheming against him at all. He couldn't understand how a single arrow could put him into such a sorry situation.\nIt had no flare, no complexity, there was hardly even any curve to it. It simply didn't make any sense.\nCralis roared, swinging down his broad sword with all his might. But, due to the fact Leonel had shot through his collarbone earlier, he could only use a single hand, causing him to end up in an even sorrier state than Umred.\nLeonel's barrage was relentless. Even with 'Heat Streak' being on cool down, he had long since unlocked the Silver Skill 'Superior Quick Fire' which cut his reload time to 0.70 seconds. Such a small time wasn't enough for the two Demon Lords to recover.\nAs though that wasn't enough, Leonel had already ungraded to the Silver Quiver.? His quiver could now hold 50 arrows and it could respawn 2 arrows every 20 seconds. In addition, this quiver had the an added effect called 'Random Reload'. There was a 10% chance of an already fired arrow reappearing within the quiver after being let loose.\nBy Leonel's calculations, if he fired at his highest rate, he could expect 'Random Reload' to activate 2-3 times every 20 seconds. This essentially meant that Leonel could expect 5 extra arrows whenever his quiver's respawn was ready. If he went all out, he'd had 55 arrows to use in a single spurt. Maybe more if he got lucky.\nAll of these thoughts and calculations spun by Leonel's mind, but they neither uplifted his mood, nor diminished it. His entire focus was on the battle at hand while Umred and Cralis were like two frogs in slowly boiling water.\nLeonel shot another arrow with every step he took. His imposing aura was no less than a mighty warrior. If it wasn't for the bow in his hands being so obvious, one would thing he was wielding a halberd, brandishing it to taste the blood of his enemies.\nThe moment the two Demon Lords lost the initiative, it was like they could never gain it back. Leonel seemed to perfectly see through their weak points, not allowing them a chance to regain their footing.\nAnd, in that very instant.\nPENG!\nLeonel activated 'Shooting Star' causing a light of panic to enter Cralis' eyes. He hurriedly blocked with his great sword, only to find he couldn't step as far back as he thought he could. All this time, he had completely forgotten that they were still within the castle walls. The pressure Leonel placed on them made them forget everything about their surroundings but him.\nHe awkwardly blocked with his great sword, unable to get as much leverage as he was expecting. However, that was when something completely astonishing happened.\nLeonel's arrow skimmed off the side of Cralis' sword, changing its trajectory and appearing before Umred in the blink of an eye.\nThe crimson demon felt his life flash before his eyes. He was still reeling from Leonel's last attack. It could be said that the only reason he survived until now was because Leonel had to split his attention between the both of them. How could he possibly challenge two attacks at once?\nHe hurriedly tried to block with his two axes but it was to no avail. He had never regretted choosing two such heavy weapons in his life. It had always been his pride and joy. But now… now he definitely regretted it.\nPCCHUU!\nThe arrow tore through Umred's chest, lodging into one of his beating hearts. Even though he had two, they were both reliant on his each other. With how large his body was, it was simply impossible to survive for long with just one.\nIt was at that moment Umred saw Leonel take another step forward, his dull eyes flashing with thoughts of victory.\n'It can't be… he predicted this…? … Monster…'\nA crimson demon with the horns of a devil calling another a monster… It was truly a great irony…\nBut… that was when the second unexpected thing of the battle occurred.\nLeonel suddenly stopped.\nNot only were Umred and Cralis confused, but even Leonel himself seemed to be confused as well. It was only after his dull eyes slowly regained their clarity that things began to make sense.\nLeonel's expressionless visage became flushed. Sweat began pouring down from his brow and his steady breathing became heavy. His muscles twitched uncontrollably as though they had been overdrafted, his mind and thoughts feeling languid and slow.\n'Shit…'\nLeonel had never expected for such a thing to happen. He had calculated everything, but he hadn't considered the possibility of his Soul Force running dry. All this time he had never had to worry about such a thing. Even when he was casting Three Star Magus Arts, it was child's play to him. How could he account for such a thing? He never thought that his greatest strength would actually fail him at such a crucial moment.\nThe sound of clapping entered Leonel's ears at that very moment. Without the support of his Soul Force, his spell maze was severely weakened and collapsed in the next instant, allowing sounds he couldn't previously hear to reach him.\nLeonel's expression had already flushed and then paled beneath his fatigue, but it only got worse when he saw that the one clapping was Lamorak.\nUnknowingly, the battle within the castle had begun to inch outside. It was clear that the two Demon Lords had been doing their best to run.\nLeonel had already long seen through this, but he had also calculated that he would be able to kill them before they could leave the range of his spell maze and alert those who hadn't entered the castle.\nWhat he didn't expect was for Lamorak to be waiting outside the large doors of the castle. And, not only was he waiting, but he had also gathered up a dozen men who had entered this capture the flag game with them…",

      "content": "Leonel breathed heavily, sweeping over the enemies before him with an expressionless gaze.\nThough he seemed to be in a bad situation, Leonel didn't feel like it was so. After all, all of his enemies were before him. He hadn't been surrounded and still had a lane to retreat.\nLeonel's gaze landed on Lamorak, measuring him up and down. He didn't bother to speak any words as there was nothing he could say that could change the current situation.\nIn a lot of ways, Lamorak and Big Buddha were incredibly similar. They were both die hard supporters of their own individual ideals – one for the Slayer Legion and the other for Camelot. To them, the moment Leonel challenged their bottom lines, he was already deemed to be an enemy of theirs.\nTo people like them, things were only in black and white. And, even if they were aware that there might be a region of gray, they would rather stamp any instances of it to protect themselves from having to challenge their own ideals.\nLeonel didn't feel like wasting his breath on people like this. Lamorak was already willing to go all out to kill him. But, the moment he saw the little mink in action, he felt as though all of his previous preconceptions were validated. This only made his fervor all the more great.\nLamorak would never consider what he would have done had the little mink not been on Leonel's side. He was simply a hypocrite, the kind of person who only sought to confirm their own biases while ignoring all else.\nIf Lamorak was any sort of objective, he would be considering why it was that a young man who could wield the Light Element would choose to side with a Dark Elemental creature. Logically, things shouldn't be as simple as they seem. But, would such a fanatic consider such a thing? And, even if they did, how seriously would they take it?\nSeeing Leonel's lack of a response to his grand entrance, Lamorak could only admit within his heart that he felt somewhat stifled.\n\"Surround him!\"\nLeonel shot backward, completely ignoring the advantage he had over the two Demon Lords. What good were slaughter points to the dead?\nIn fact, Leonel had learned during the third round that slaughter points could be stolen upon death. He had no desire for his hard work to benefit someone else, and held even less of a desire to die.\nUnfortunately, just because he willed it to be so, didn't mean that his body would function as he wanted. He was in a state of complete exhaustion, causing his body to be sluggish and uncoordinated.\nThe good news was that it was only his Soul Force that was completely drained, the Force within his body was still ample and could be slowly converted into Soul Force given enough time after being purified by the two stars of his Two Star Constitution.\nHowever, where there was good, there was also bad.\nSoul Force was what sustained Leonel's ability. Without it, his calculative abilities took a massive dip, his Dreamscape became useless and his Internal Strength couldn't be used to monitor his surroundings.\nIn addition, Soul Force also represented the focus of the mind even outside the use of Leonel's ability. Without it, his judgement and reflexes were impaired. Before, Leonel's coordination and reflexes used to be strengths of his stats, but now, they had plummeted by more than half each…\nLeonel nocked an arrow and fired, hoping to maintain the distance between him and his pursuers. He still had several contingency plans to use, he just had to make it to them. But, he was completely astonished by what happened next.\nHis arrow shot through the whistling wind, appearing before a charging human of Camelot in an instant.\nThe young man in knight's armor froze, his body trembling as though he saw his life flash before his eyes. However, the sharp pain he had expected never appeared.\nNot only was he stunned, but Leonel was even more so.\nHis arrow sailed, shooting into the ground and managing to land on the thigh of an unassuming mage who cried out in pain. However, Leonel was still in a daze.\nHe missed? He never missed. Outside of the time Leonel took to get used to the recoil of 15th century guns within the Mayan Tomb Zone, he couldn't remember the last time he missed. Even during his career as a quarterback, unless it was a hit impeding his throwing motion… He had never missed his target.\nIt was such a shock to Leoenl that he almost paused his steps, not believing what he was seeing.\nIt was at that moment Leonel realized that the drain of his Spirit Pressure affected far more than he thought it had.\n'This is bad…'\nLeonel was the only one who realized just how bad his situation was. Others thought it was simply normal if a bowman missed once in a while, not to mention the fact that Leonel's arrow had still technically hit a target. But, Leonel knew that if he stayed here for any longer, his situation would turn dire soon.\n\"Mages!\" Lamorak coldly commanded.\nLamorak had waited here all this time. How could he not be aware of Leonel's potential escape route?\nHe might have been more powerful than Leonel, but his main occupation was as a General. The importance of a General Star to Camelot just might be greater than a Three Star Magus despite the fact there was more of the former than the latter.\nHowever, one had to know that just because one had awakened a General Star didn't necessarily mean theirs was at the highest level nor did it mean it was necessarily serviceable, even.\nIt could only be said that Lamorak's was far beyond a normal level…\nA volley of arrow spells shots into the skies, falling toward Leonel like a rain of meteors.\nArrows of earth, fire, wind and water… it felt as though all the elements of the world were converging onto a single man. The surge of Force was so great the front wall of the castle collapsed, widening the doorway until it was dozens of meters across.\n'Little Blackstar.'\nLeonel grit his teeth. He knew this move took a lot out of the little guy, but he had no choice. Most of the spells he had prepared in advance had collapsed after his Soul Force ran out. And obviously, he had no ability to cast any more.\nThe little mink stood on his four little paws, latching onto Leonel's hair. He growled, his hair standing on end until he seemed to double in size.\nJust when Leonel was about to be completely overwhelmed, his body was suddenly covered by a thin layer of black fog.\nSHUUUUU!\nThe violent fluctuations of magic shot through him completely, shattering the ground beneath him and leaving the ground of the castle in shambles.",

      "content": "\"Charge!\"\nLamorak watched coldly as Leonel was completely enveloped by a swarm of spells. He was so invested in the death of Leonel that the irony was completely lost on him.\nBetween Lamorak and Leonel, there were still the #2 and #4 Demon Lords. Not only were they both there, but they were both still heavily injured. It could even be said that they were on their last breaths with Umred being in the far worse condition.\nUmred had at most a few more minutes to live with one of his two hearts pierced through. Not only was he bleeding out, but even if that wasn't the case, a single heart wasn't enough to sustain his massive body.\nBy his side, Cralis wasn't in as bad of a position, but he was still originally weaker than Umred to begin with. In addition, he could only use a single arm with limited use of the other after Leonel shattered his collarbone.\nTo this point, Leonel hadn't done a single thing to harm Camelot. In fact, aside from killing some humans who entered this capture the flag game to target him, all of his kills to this point had been committed against demons. Not once had he actively targeted humans.\nYet, here was Lamorak, a supposed great knight of Camelot, ignoring two Demon Lords right before him for the sake of taking down Leonel.\nMaybe in his mind this was still justified. Before Modred appeared, there had always been demons and humans. However, it was only after Modred organized demons and gave them strength and intelligence that they truly became dangerous.\nTo Lamorak, Leonel was another potential Modred. Not only that, but he was a man. As a man of this medieval era, Lamorak still subconsciously placed more emphasis on the role of a man. To him, not only would Leonel become another influence like Modred, but he would become something even more dangerous.\nThis went beyond just the fact Modred was a woman. Others might not be aware, but Lamorak was keenly aware that Modred was King Arthur's daughter. It was precisely due to this tightly held secret that the relationship between their King and Queen had been somewhat estranged in the past decade.\nDue to this relationship, Modred always had some reservations dealing with Camelot. If not for this, maybe things would have gotten out of hand long ago.\nHowever… did Leonel have such ties?\nNot only did he not, but his future was almost ruined by Camelot if not for him taking matters into his own hands.\nSuch a threat… to Lamorak, was even higher than two top four Demon Lords.\nBy Lamorak's calculations, Leonel was likely not dead. But, he was most definitely severely injured. It was the best time to surround him now.\nThe knights of Camelot charged into the billowing dust, completely ignoring the two Demon Lords. With Lamorak's senses locked onto them, they didn't dare to make any rash movements against the people of Camelot, or else they knew that this small reprieve they had gained would shatter.\nThey all knew that the quality of elite warriors Camelot had was greater than them as Demons. This was the reason they could survive despite being so outnumbered. Even at full health, they might not be a match of Lamorak.\nHowever, exactly what no one expected to happen occurred at that moment.\nStreaks of darkness shot out from the cloud of dust. Though they were faster than most eyes could follow, they came in sets of threes as though a creature of the darkness had torn space apart with their claws.\nThe frontline of knights completely collapsed. Those who didn't die had their armor collapse and their bones broken. Those that were more unlucky were torn in half, their bodies erupting into a rain of blood and gore.\nAt that moment, Leonel shot out from the back of the crater, using it as cover to escape as quickly as he could.\nThe little mink no longer had the strength to cling to his neck or his hair, Leonel could only hold the little one in his arms, careful not to harm its fragile little body.\nIn the instant before those magic arrows landed, the little mink had taken Leonel into his shadow world. Though it was very easy for the little mink to enter that land as it pleased, making him immune to attacks. Taking someone else with him was enough to drain more than half of the little guy's stamina.\nAs though that wasn't enough, the little mink had to send out its most powerful attack an instant later. Little Blackstar had given Leonel all he had, Leonel couldn't ask for any more.\nThis was the most important reason Leonel had been hesitant to use the little guy to now. Blackstar was still an infant. Not only were his actions quite childish, but his stamina was still lacking. Leonel felt terrible even asking this much of the little guy.\nLeonel ran with all he had, charging out and putting distance between him and the others.\nHe couldn't use his Light Elemental Force at the moment. Unfortunately, he learned another important use of his Soul Force in that moment.\nThe Embryo of Leonel's Light Elemental Force was within his Ethereal Glabella. In order to communicate with it, he relied on a basal amount of Soul Force. Without Soul Force, he couldn't communicate with it and thus couldn't use his Force Strengthening Deviations.\nLamorak's expression changed. Was that a final attack on his last legs?\nFrom his vantage point, Lamorak couldn't see Leonel through the cloud of dust. To make matters worse, since he had used his senses to lock onto the two Demon Lords so that they couldn't act, he hadn't spared any Internal Sight toward Leonel.\nBy the time he clenched his jaw and removed a strand of his senses to look toward Leonel, he realized that… there was actually nothing in the crater!\nHe didn't have time to guess about how Leonel had done it. He completely abandoned his command, charging forward personally.\nThe difference in speed was striking. Leonel might have his normal Force, but with his coordination lacking, his speed suffered a 10% drop. In addition, without his Light Elemental Force, he didn't have access to his usual speed either, making matters even worse.\nUnder normal circumstances, Lamorak wasn't a match for Leonel in speed at his current peak. But now…\nLamorak shrouded his forward path with his senses, searching for Leonel. Without his Soul Force, Leonel had no ability to hide himself from detection. It took no more than a few seconds for his position to be locked onto.\nLeonel continued to charge as though he didn't realize he had been found.\n'I can make it. At this current speed it should take …'\nLeonel furiously shook his head. Without his ability, he couldn't even finish calculations that used to be as easy as breathing for him. Leonel began to wonder if his ability had become a crutch…\nLeonel grit his teeth. He didn't have the mind space to waste for errant thoughts. He had only one goal: to make it to his destination. As long as he did, he could ride out the rest of his trial.\nWhile his other spells had dissipated, there was one that hadn't. Teleportation arrays were Magic Arts specially designed to be autonomous from their creator's Soul Force. If not for this, how could Camelot rely on them for transport?\nThis was Leonel's last and final contingency plan. He just had to make it.\n\"Boy! Accept the punishment for your crimes!\"\nLamorak's roar felt as though it was just over Leonel's shoulder. Had Leonel still been able to use his Internal Sight, he would realize that Lamorak was less than 200 meters away. With their speed, such a distance could be covered in barely ten seconds, if that. Leonel couldn't afford to pause.\n'I'm close, I'm close.'\nLeonel shot through the corridors, reaching the hallway that acted as the final stretch to the Throne Room.\nIt was at that moment, just as Leonel rounded the final corner, that he felt a mighty force suddenly slam into his body.\nThe air was completely knocked out of him. He felt his bones quake and his inner organs tremble. With the sturdiness of his body after awakening his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, it wasn't enough to severely injure him. But, in his current weakened state, it was enough to send him flying backward, skidding along the ground and toward the one enemy he was running with his everything from. He only barely had time to protect the fragile little mink in his arms.\nLeonel couldn't use his Internal Sight. But, he vaguely saw a massive palm through his swimming vision.. And, behind the massive, larger than life palm was… a severely injured Big Buddha.",

      "content": "Leonel groaned, trying his best to stand.\nHe felt his mind spinning. The thumping pain in his mind had been slowly growing since his Soul Force ran dry. After getting knocked away by Big Buddha, it seemed to have dampened his pain threshold, making it feel as though someone was constantly hammering his head.\nLeonel stumbled to his feet. In one arm he held onto the little mink and in the other… there was nothing. His bow was too heavy. How could he continue to carry it as he ran? Plus, with the current state of his mind, there was no guarantee that it would even be useful to him now.\nUnder normal circumstances, it would be impossible for someone like Big Buddha to catch Leonel off guard. But, these weren't normal circumstances.\nHe truly couldn't believe that a half dead Big Buddha would rather risk his life and drag up his last bit of strength to push Leonel back toward Lamorak. Was he really that hateful? Was he really so much of an eyesore to this man he once respected?\nLeonel coughed violently. Luckily, no blood came out. But, his body felt uncomfortable all over and no place felt more so than his heart. He was caught between shock, despair and rage. The emotions swelled up within his chest to the point it felt his torso might burst at any moment.\nAt that moment, Big Buddha that had been standing before Leonel fell to one knee, weakly gasping for breath.\nBlood leaked from his lips as his massive hands shrank down once more. It seemed that he had used up the last of his strength sending out that final attack.\nBig Buddha didn't really understand the situation. His actions weren't so planned as one might think. He only barely managed to lock onto Leonel with his senses and decided to launch a counter attack with everything he had left.\nOf course, he could vaguely tell that Leonel was running from something. Being able to obstruct Leonel gave him a faint satisfaction even as his body seemed like it might collapse at any time.\nAt that moment, Leonel already knew it was too late to keep running from Lamorak. Not only did he need to reach the teleportation pad, but he needed at least a one to two second delay between the time he reached it and Lamorak's appearance. It was such a small time requirement, yet it felt worlds away at this point. Just a single action of Big Buddha's had brought all of that crumbling.\nLeonel clenched his jaw, turning his gaze back toward Lamorak's figure. As though realizing the situation, the latter had long since stopped running. He walked with a calm pace, closing the rest of the distance between him and Leonel in what seemed like the blink of an eye. It wasn't long before he was standing just five meters from Leonel.\nWhether it was due to caution or another reason, Lamorak didn't move to kill Leonel immediately. He still had no idea how Leonel had dodged the barrage of arrows previously. In fact, even taking a larger step back, Lamorak wasn't exactly sure what happened between Leonel and the two Demon Lords.\nHis instincts told him that Leonel was a spent force. However, he still remained hesitant. To be able to push two top four Demon Lords to the brink of death… Lamorak could only admit that this was something he couldn't have done so easily.\nCould it be that Leonel was actually more powerful than him?\nIt was a thought that had wormed its way into Lamorak's heart. It made him approach the situation differently than he would have in the past.\n\"It seems your actions have given you enemies everywhere.\"\nLeonel didn't respond to these words. The act he had put on in Camelot was one thing, but this was the true Leonel. He had no intention of throwing a temper tantrum for the man before him. No matter how wronged he felt, no matter how unfair it seemed, he had nothing to say.\nHe stared toward Lamorak as though waiting for his next action.\nLamorak's eyes narrowed. It seemed that he too realized that the Leonel of before had been nothing more than an act. The truest form of Leonel, the one where he could cast off his fears and face the trial ahead with his everything… that was the Leonel before him.\nA stifling pressure exuded from the young 18 year old boy. Beneath it, Big Buddha felt stifled to the point of being unable to breathe.\nLeonel flipped his palm, using his Internal Sight sparingly to communicate with his spatial bracelet and bring out the dictionary.\nLamorak took an involuntarily step backward believing that this might be a trump card. How could he know that it was nothing but a walking encyclopedia?\nFrom what Lamorak knew, only the treasures of Merlin worked within the trials, so how could he think that the small silver disk in Leonel's hand was anything but lethal?\n\"What's the fastest way for me to replenish my Soul Force?\"\nLeonel's sudden words stunned Lamorak.\n[*Ping*]\n[ Replying to Seed, [Dimensional Cleanse] ]\nHearing these words, Leonel came to a certain understanding.\nHis spirit always skyrocketed after cultivating [Dimensional Cleanse], this was especially so after forming his One Star and subsequent Two Star Constitution. Those benefits had become less obvious after awakening his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor's Wisdom Branch. But, that didn't change the fact.\nIn fact, when Leonel first chose [Dimensional Cleanse], his purpose was to find a technique that could help him capitalize on his ability. Back then, his exact words to Uncle Montez had been…\n~\"I felt this one could help improve my ability. I had already chosen before I knew its name.\"~\nThe moment he laid eyes on [Dimensional Cleanse], it felt as though it was calling out to him. The only unfortunate part was that the technique was incomplete.\nBack then, he only had a Tier 9 Black reward to exchange for it. How could he trade for the whole of [Dimensional Cleanse]? Leonel suspected that there were even abilities of his Two Star Constitution that he was unaware of even now…\nNow that Leonel thought about it, he shouldn't have been able to trade for Little Tolly with a Tier 9 Black reward either. Yet, Uncle Montez had still given the little guy to him… He had been ignorant back then, but how could he still be so?\nWhat if [Dimensional Cleanse] was the same? A reward he shouldn't have been allowed to lay hands on, yet Uncle Montez bent the rules in his favor…?\nLeonel closed his eyes.\nHe didn't have Soul Force and his ability had entered a state of dormancy. As a result, he could no longer split his mind toward different tasks. He was no different from a normal human with an abnormally strong body.\nIf he circulated [Dimensional Cleanse] now, he could focus on nothing else. If he was distracted for even a moment, he could suffer backlash and cripple himself.\nLeonel clenched his jaw. When his eyes opened once more, he looked toward Lamorak with a piercingly cold gaze.\nViolent winds suddenly shot up around him as all the Force within several hundred meters surged toward him in full force.",

      "content": "Lamorak's expression changed.\nHe didn't know what Soul Force was, it was a completely foreign concept to him. He had no idea that what Leonel called Soul Force was the very same Spirit Pressure he had known all his life.\nThis had been deliberate on Leonel's part. Without understanding what was going on, Lamorak only became more hesitant, allowing Leonel a few extra precious seconds. To the current Leonel, every single one of these moments mattered.\nStill… it was just for a few seconds.\nLamorak wasn't a fool. He knew whatever was happening now would inevitably help Leonel even if he didn't know what Soul Force was. If he kept hesitating because of the unknown, the role of predator and prey might flip right before his eyes.\nUltimately, he was a veteran general of countless battles. The one thing he didn't lack was decisiveness.\nWithout hesitation, a fiery red and dense Force shot up around him like flickering flames.\nHe reached toward his back, pulling a massive, blunt and cylindrical mace from its holster before shooting toward Leonel.\nHe put his everything into this strike, not holding back in the slightest. He put so much power into his attack that the sturdy polearm of the mace bent into an elegant arc, whistling through the air with an opposingly grating sound.\nBANG!\nLamorak was stunned.\nThis time, it wasn't because he missed or that Leonel managed to find a way to evade. Leonel hadn't moved a single inch. His brow didn't twitch, his fingers didn't tremble, his cold eyes didn't waver even as the mace smashed into his body, sending him flying into the sturdy walls of Camelot's castle.\nLamorak couldn't help but watch on with a speechless expression. What just happened? Was Leonel suicidal?\nHe knew himself just how much strength he had put into that strike. It was more powerful than any attack he had used against Leonel during their first battle.\nBack then, Leonel couldn't even take on a casual strike of his. That alone had been enough to fracture Leonel's bones.\nIn truth, Lamorak had been stunned even back then. After all, a normal person would have been blasted into a cloud of gore after one of his strikes, let alone the fact Leonel hadn't been wearing any armor.\nHowever, that was all. Besides being somewhat stunned, it wasn't enough for him to lose his mind.\nThis time, Leonel was also not wearing any armor. How could he possibly survive?\nLamorak sighed a breath of relief. It was finally over.\nJust when Lamorak wanted to relax completely, he suddenly realized that the violent surge of Internal Strength was still spiraling. In fact, now that he wasn't panicking, he was stunned by just how much there was. It couldn't be that Leonel was trying to meditate? Wait, no, how could a single person's meditation cause such a thing?!\nLamorak looked toward Leonel who had cracked apart the walls of the castle. A spider web of shattered stone hung around him. But, those cold eyes were still there. His gaze never left Lamorak. They didn't flicker with pain or anguish. They remained completely emotionless as Force continued to seep into his body.\nThe Force entered his Ethereal Glabella, causing the Two Stars within his Ethereal Glabella to begin to slowly spin once more. It was so slow that it was difficult to tell that they were moving at all. At this pace, it would take several days just to complete a single rotation. Yet, Leonel was still persisting.\n\"You…\"\nLamorak's gaze flashed with a savage light.\nHe charged toward the wall, raising his blunt mace and smashing it down.\nLeonel didn't raise his hands to block or take any measures to move. In fact, the only reason he was staring down Lamorak wasn't in some act of overly confident display of force while he, himself was in a sorry situation.\nLeonel was only human. No matter how much he willed it, it was impossible to ignore a momentary spike in pain as though he was made of iron. His only choice was to pause his circulation of [Dimensional Cleanse] right before Lamorak hit him. Only like this could he ensure he didn't suffer any backlash. However, without Internal Sight, he could only rely on his eyes to monitor Lamorak's movements.\nHe had no choice but to do this even if Lamorak saw it as a form of defiance.\nUnfortunately, that was exactly how Lamorak saw it. Every time he put his everything into a strike, he would find Leonel's gaze looking back at him as though nothing had happened.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nThe bones and flesh across Leonel's body shattered, splintered and bled. If it wasn't because he reached the Standard State, allowing his current body to match the Weak State when his Runes were activated, he would have long since been beaten into a meat patty.\nLeonel was truly barely holding on. Being forced to pause his technique at the instant Lamorak hit him only made everything worse. An already slow process only became slower.\nHis two Stars were slowly picking up speed, but with the pain racking his body, it felt to Leonel as though the time would never come.\nLamorak's gaze was completely bloodshot.\nHe reached forward, picking up Leonel by his throat. His arm bulged, slowly squeezing the life out of Leonel.\nEven as his face turned red, Leonel continued to stare at Lamorak. From this close, Lamorak felt as though a winter storm was brewing around him, causing goosebumps to run up his tanned skin.\nLeonel couldn't have been in a sorrier state. His limbs were bent into awkward angles, his chest had bloomed into an open cavity of shattered bone and organs as though a crimson rose, and his blood dropped to the floor like a savage rain.\nHe had never been in such pain in his life. What held him together wasn't a deep sense of pride or responsibility, but simply the will to live. The shame of giving up on his own life still weighed heavily on his soul. Whether consciously or subconsciously, he refused to feel that same shame again.\nYet… his gaze made Lamorak feel as though he was the one suffering such severe wounds.\nMaybe the only good things about Lamorak's crazed gaze was that he didn't have the presence of mind to turn any of his rage toward the little mink Leonel had tossed away to a far off corner.",

      "content": "Leonel's legs hung weakly in the air, his face slowly turning red as Lamorak's hand clamped down on his throat.\nIt felt as though his whole body was washed by pain. It was an endless torrent that rammed through his senses like a tsunami, crashing through his mind in a repetitive, infinite cycle.\nIn his current state, lasting without oxygen for tens of minutes at a time, though difficult, wouldn't be impossible. However, having one's throat clamped down wasn't just about oxygen, it was also about blood flow.\nLeonel felt his head becoming light, the pounding headache he had earned himself after his Soul Force ran dry was only getting worse. Yet, maybe in an odd twist of fate, he could just barely ignore because its level of pain was nothing compared to what was happening to the rest of his body.\nLamorak became irrationally enraged, staring toward Leonel's unwavering gaze.\nWhether it was consciously or subconsciously, he felt as though all of his actions were being judged. It was impossible to tell whether he knew he was in the wrong, but all that was important was that he didn't like having to question himself in this way.\nA roar escaped his lips as he slammed Leonel into the already cracked walls. The result was Leonel's already slipping consciousness swirling once more.\nLeonel found it difficult to tell which way was up and which way was down. The whole world seemed to swim. He only barely managed to hold on to two thoughts.\nOne was the circulation method of [Dimensional Cleanse], and the second was the start and stop timing of this circulation.\nHe knew it was the only way for him to survive. He just needed his Soul Force to recover. It seemed so close and yet so far at the same time.\nAt some point, the pain began to numb his body. But, was this a good thing? Pain was a sign of life… so what was numbness a sign of?\nLeonel clenched his jaw, weathering the storm of Lamorak's rage. Just a little more, just a little more.\nLamorak's grip tightened around Leonel's throat even more as though trying to twist his head off. However, he found his actions no different from trying to squeeze a thick metal pole.\nWhen he looked at Leonel's body. Though his flesh was beaten and batted, along with his bones being broken in several places, it all seemed far too shallow for the punishment the Grand Knight had inflicted onto him.\nAny other person would have been beaten into a pile of mush by now, but why was Leonel still in one piece? Why was his neck so sturdy? Was he really made out of metal?\nThe more Lamorak thought, the more panicked he became. He had never run across something like this in his lifetime. To have someone allow him to go all out to kill them, yet to actually be unable to do so even after so much time had passed…\nThe more blows Lamorak landed, the more his panic set in and fused with his rage. He felt as though the longer this went on, the more dangerous his situation became.\n\"Die! Die! DIE!\"\nLamorak completely lost his composure. The calm Knight of the Round Table had somehow become a madman.\nIt felt to him that as long as he could kill Leonel, then it would all be justified. Those judgmental eyes, he didn't want to see them anymore, he didn't want to have to face the consequences of his own choices.\nIt was quite an ironic turn of events.\nWhen Lamorak first met Leonel, it was the latter who had lost his mind. Leonel had reacted inappropriately to the situation due to something influencing his mind. Maybe had he not reacted that way, things might have traveled down a different path.\nAnd now, it was Lamorak who had lost his cool.\nLeonel didn't know how much pressure Lamorak had been under in these past few months. It was his suggestion that turned Camelot against Leonel. Though it didn't seem like it on the surface, this affected the trust between him and King Arthur.\nOf course, when one was having internal struggles, they had to show a united front to others. But, internally, the struggles would continue.\nLamorak could tell that the trust between him and King Arthur had broken. The man he had sworn to follow his whole life no longer looked at him the same. Not only had he alienated such a talent, but he had also been the one monitoring Leonel during his escape.\nHe had to fix it. If he couldn't kill Leonel, he would never be able to.\n\"AGH!\"\nLamorak dragged Leonel's face across the stone walls, throwing him with all his might.\nBig Buddha watched as Leonel's body fell like a ragdoll beside him. A light, satisfied chuckle left his lips along with a steady drizzle of blood. He couldn't even lift a finger to kill Leonel even though he was right before him.\nJudging by Lamorak's struggles, even if he was in peak condition, killing Leonel would be too difficult. That said, that didn't change the delight he felt.\nFor him, dying for the Slayer Legion cause was only natural. He had prepared himself to die for the Slayer Legion long ago. Taking down a future enemy of their rebel army before his own death made everything worth it. He had something to raise his head and be proud about.\n\"This is what… you deserve…\"\nBig Buddha wheezed out with the last of his strength. Even though his kneeling position wasn't much different from Leonel who lay on the ground, he still stood above, loftily casting judgment he believed the latter deserved.\nAt that moment, Lamorak had rushed over, raising his blunt mace above his head. A fiery qi shot around him, rising around his body and piercing toward the ceiling above.\nBANG!\nLamorak didn't pause, not even sparing a glance toward Big Buddha who had gotten sent flying beneath the air pressure of his strike. He rose his mace again, swinging down with all his might.\nBANG!\n\"HAHAHAHA!\"\nBig Buddha slid down the wall he smashed against, his laughter resounding through the halls of the castle. Yes, it was all worth it. All of it was worth it.\nBANG!\nLeonel's body was like a small boat in a raging storm. The only thing he clung onto was shame. It wasn't a shame he felt now, but rather one from months ago.\nNot again, never again.\nEven if he died here, it wouldn't be due to lack of trying.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nThe surging winds around his black chained spear grew more resounding. They had already shifted violently beneath his choice during the first Elimination Round. But now, it was even more active as though trying to make its presence known.\nBANG!\nLamorak's chest heaved. He had been giving it his everything. He had never regretted choosing a blunt weapon in his life. Yet, for maybe the first time he was. If only he had a sword, an ax, a blade of any sort. Would he be in this situation now?\nIt was quite ironic… just moments before, wasn't Umred lamenting his choice of weapon too? Maybe… Just maybe… it had nothing to do with the weapon at all.\nLamorak roared, his muscles bulging as he raised his blunt mace with two hands, his aura towering.\nFrom below, Leonel looked on, his blood having fused with the cracked ground around him. No matter what happened, he seemed to stare toward Lamorak endlessly.\nHe didn't say a word. His lips were splintered and cracked, yet he held them sealed.\nThe slow rotation of his Two Stars had become much faster. As though pulling at chains that had held them down, the rotation only increased with each passing moment.\nBANG!",

      "content": "Leonel didn't regret his actions earlier.\nHis regret had become a recurring event with him. He would make a mistake, acknowledge it, then move on. Over time, he wouldn't make the same mistake again, but that wouldn't stop him from making more and continuing to regret them.\nFor all intents and purposes, this was another mistake. Leonel didn't consider the fact his Soul Force could ever run out. This was only natural. He had become so used to using his Soul Force with impunity, he didn't even think reaching his limit was possible.\nIt seemed impossible to him. After all, he had a mind with the capacity of a Fifth Dimensional entity even if he was lacking in the power. Running out of strength while battling within the Third Dimension would seem ridiculous to anyone.\nHowever, this was the reality before Leonel…\nYet, he didn't regret it. In fact, it was something that filled his heart with anticipation and fervor.\nThe power his Dreamscape Battle Sense ability gave him was something he could have never imagined. He toyed with the lives of two Demon Lords. Even if it was Lamorak before him, he would have been able to force the Knight of the Round Table into a corner as well. Leonel was certain of this.\nIt was a power he created himself. It wasn't something he was born with like his Metal Synergy or his Spear Domain Lineage Factor. He had built it with his own two hands.\nThere was something about this that filled him with pride. He had earned it. It was his. Whatever consequences might come with it, he would take. And why not? It was his.\nMaybe the reason Leonel felt this way was because these emotions were in such sharp contrast to his shame.\nThese thoughts had been floating withing Leonel's mind for so long already. How many times had he been lucky to survive?\nLeonel still remembered the conversation he had had with Roaring Black Lion within the hive cave. He might have had very few interactions with Roaring Black Lion, but that one in particular resonated with Leonel.\nThe new world older seemed to make the pains of the past worse. The bad of human nature seemed to have been peeled back like a festering wound, open to being damaged more and more with every passing moment.\nLeonel realized how lucky he was to be in his position. Whether it be the talent passed down to him by his parents or the odd twists of fate that had allowed him to keep his life until now. His Dreamscape Battle Sense was one of the first things that wasn't just luck. Sure, his ability was gifted to him, but how he used it was built with his own hands.\nThat budding feeling within his chest seemed to grow.\nWith every strike Lamorak landed on him, these thoughts only reaffirmed themselves.\nThis pain that he was suffering now? Was it worth it?\nBANG!\nWas it still worth it now?\nBANG!\nHow about now? Were you still proud? Did you still hold your head high? Are you not willing to beg for mercy yet?\nBANG!\nIt was a repetitive cycle. The whistling wind, Lamorak's roar, the sound of metal meeting flesh, Big Buddha's cackling laughter…\nIt was all imprinted within Leonel's heart.\nEven he didn't understand what this budding feeling was or what it represented. Maybe that was just how human nature was. People thought about inexplicable things at inexplicable moments. They felt ways they couldn't explain and ignored what might have been logical at any given instant.\nHowever, there would come a day where Leonel understood even if it wasn't now.\nFor now, though… He felt a welling sense of pride. Because at least this time, he hadn't given up.\nLamorak raged, his mace swinging down with everything he had. He lost himself in his emotion. He didn't hear the sound of his weapon connecting, he couldn't feel it either as his arms grew numb. He couldn't even hear the sound of Big Buddha's laughter.\nAll he saw was Leonel's gaze. That empty, calculating gaze as his body was slowly being beaten into the ground.\nAt that moment, a massive crater had appeared within the castle. As Lamorak pounded down, he sunk further into the crater along with Leonel, not caring for what might happen to the foundation of Camelot.\nBy this point, many of the warriors he had been commanding had long since caught up. They watched this scene with astonished gazes, not knowing what they should be doing.\nBut, Lamorak didn't notice them either. All he saw was that gaze, those two pale green eyes. They seemed to be the only part of Leonel's body left untainted by blood…\nThen… he swore… he swore he saw those two eyes smile.\n\"[Grand… Heal]…\"\nLeonel's voice cut through the whistling wind.\nAt that moment, the situation changed. A blinding surge of light encased Leonel, repelling Lamorak back several feet.\n[Grand Heal].\nLamorak didn't believe what he had just heard. In the whole of Camelot, there were only two people who could use this spell, each more respected than the last. One was Pope Margrave and the second was the man he respected the most in this entire world… King Arthur.\nIt was a Three Star Magus Art on a completely different level than [Minor Heal]. In fact, it was so difficult to cast that it was even set apart from other Three Star Magus Arts.\nThe reason this Art was so difficult to cast was because not only was it a healing spell, but it was simultaneously a defense spell. Upon activation, the spell would give off a massive push forcefield, forcing any enemies in the vicinity back. Even Lamorak was blasted back tens of meters before he could even react. By the time he realized what was happening and charged forward again, his visage coated with a savage expression, it was already too late.\nLeonel slowly stood from the crater, his clothing in complete tatters. His movements were slow, yet they held an undisguised strength behind them.\nHis sturdy, bronzed skin shone through the tears in his robes, giving him a wild, untamed appearance.\nIn the past several months, Leonel's hair had grown uncontrollably. Plus, due to the fact it was as sturdy as thin filaments of metal now, it was simply too much of a hassle to cut. By now, it was already approaching the small of his back, completing his unrestrained look.\nWith a flip of his palm, his bow appeared. Even without an arrow nocked, Big Buddha's laughter came to a grinding halt and those warriors who were in the surroundings involuntarily took a step back.\n\"I hope you had fun.\" Leonel said indifferently.. \"It's my turn now.\"",

      "content": "Leonel didn't wait for Lamorak's response. He had already taken a step forward and nocked his first arrow.\nBronze Runes lit all across his body, a halo of violet-bronze hanging above his head. At the same time, a crown etched itself across his forehead, making him look no different from a holy king.\nThis experience taught Leonel something very important. His Soul Force stamina wasn't just about the amount of Soul Force reserves he had, but also about how quickly he was able to replenish it.\nThe slow spinning of his Two Stars wasn't meaningless. At all times, they were siphoning Force from the surroundings and converting it into Soul Force for his use. The reason he had ended up in such a sorry state before was because he had used up his Soul Force faster than his constitution could replenish it.\nOnce his Soul Force dried up, the power balance of his Ethereal Glabella broke, causing his Stars to lose their impetus to spin. As a consequence, he needed far more Soul Force to allow them to begin to spin once more.\nHowever, the instant they began to move once again, Leonel didn't have to wait for the rest of his Soul Force to recover. He could entirely rely on his Stars to replenish his Spirit Pressure faster than he was using it.\nLeonel activated 'Hot Streak' without a second thought, firing out five shots before Lamorak could even understand the change to the situation.\nFive mages found a bloody hole to their forehead before they registered any pain. Their dazes became dull, falling down in a heap of their own flesh.\nLamorak was stunned by the sudden change before his eyes turned a furious shade of red.\n\"BOY!\"\nLeonel's expression turned cold.\n\"I have long since been tired of you.\"\nThese were the second time Leonel spoke these words. But, compared to the first time, he meant them even more.\nHe watched Lamorak pick himself up and charge toward him with a cold expression. As though he didn't realize the danger he was in, he continued firing. It felt as though every step forward Lamorak took, another one of his people would fall. No matter how much he raged and shouted, Leonel didn't seem to hear any of it.\n\"You… You monster…\"\nLamorak steps had almost reached Leonel, but his spirit was tired. He hadn't held back at all while trying to kill Leonel just now. It could be said that he was already a spent force, yet Leonel was actually alive.\nIt seemed like it was all a joke. He, a Knight of the Round Table, wasn't able to kill someone who couldn't even move to defend themselves.\nLeonel almost laughed at Lamorak's words.\n\"Monster? When did I ever target any humans? How many demons have I kill in comparison to humans? Now you want to surround me, pray on me, kill me, and then call me a monster when I retaliate?\n\"There was a point in time where I saw you as a rival to surmount. You have no idea how many thoughts I've spared toward you in just the last month. But, you've disappointed me.\n\"I realize now that being powerful doesn't make one worthy of respect.\"\nLeonel smiled. It was a smile of relief, the kind one could only smile after a great burden had been taken from their hearts.\nHis loss to Lamorak had been weighing on his mind for a long time. But, he finally felt that weight lifted from him today.\nLeonel met Lamorak's gaze. He could see that the latter's gaze was still reddened to the point of irrationality. Even if he heard Leonel's words, it was unlikely that he had recognized his faults. But, Leonel no longer cared.\nHe fired a last arrow, slaughtering the last of the humans before turning his attention back toward Lamorak. However, Leonel was stunned to realize that this Grand Knight wasn't even moving toward him anymore.\nHe looked toward Leonel like a wounded beast. Then, did something that left Leonel not knowing how to feel.\nLamorak stared toward Leonel with bloodshot eyes. His Force surged, building up toward his head.\nIn the next instant, his head exploded. It was a level of gruesome that couldn't even be explained.\nBlood and brain matter fell from his headless shoulders. And, not long later, his body slumped to the ground, keeling over.\nLeonel stared forward for a long while, not knowing what to say or do.\nIn the end, he could only shake his head and sigh.\nWas it something about this world that made people act like this? He really wished he could do something about it…\nWhen Leonel regained his bearings, his gaze turned cold as it swept toward the one person he had left alive – Big Buddha.\nBy now, the large man had long since stopped laughing. His gaze looked dull, he only slightly trembled when he noticed that Leonel was looking toward him.\n\"Was it worth it?\" Leonel asked.\nHe didn't know why he asked. He didn't expect to get anything out of it, yet he did so anyway.\n\"Ha…\" Big Buddha chuckled. \"… You're alive, how could it be?\"\nLeonel shook his head before piercing Big Buddha's throat with an arrow. He looked up toward the ceiling of the castle and sighed.\n**\nAt that moment, within the Merlin Trial grounds, everyone was waiting silently.\nThose who hadn't gone had made a strategic choice. After all, not going was essentially like gaining a free 24 hours of rest. Such a break was incredibly rare during the trials. Obviously, the recovery rewards simply weren't enough, especially for those who chose to use the energy more toward cultivation rather than toward healing themselves.\nLike this, many kept to themselves. Some tried to pry into the Segmented Cube Leonel left behind, but it was too difficult to cross the void to reach it. Plus, even if they did, they thought that since Leonel dared to leave it here, it was likely something they couldn't pry into all that easily to begin with.\nSoon, the time limit approach and many began to go on alert again. Those who had lived through the Random Event should be coming back any time now.\n'That boy, he's probably dead, right?'\nMost were thinking along these lines. Though the choice to go wasn't made public, it was pretty obvious by those who were here.\nTwo top four Demon Lords had gone along with seven other lower ranked Demon Lords. On top of that, there was Lamorak who had clearly disappeared as well and he had even taken what seemed like a small troop of humans. That boy was finished.\nKing Arthur looked up from his meditation with indifferent eyes. He wasn't thinking about whether or not Leonel survived, this was a foregone conclusion in his mind. He was thinking about how he would get his hands on the Segmented Cube afterward.\nUnlike others, this wasn't a matter of greed for him. It was rather about the little girl.\nKing Arthur knew Pope Margrave well and he had information channels monitoring The Church. This little girl seemed to be very important to the Pope, he just didn't know why. Since he couldn't understand, it was better that he controlled this card in his hand.\nAs he was lost in thought, a small flash of light swept through.\n<Random Event Complete>\n<Winner: Defending Team>\n<Trial Grade: Perfect>\nAt that moment, dozens of pairs of eyes landed on a young man who appeared with an indifferent expression, his clothes ripped and covered with blood. He held his bow in his hand and swept an unperturbed gaze over those stunned gazes.\nLeonel had returned.",

      "content": "<Skill Points Rewarded: 100 000>\n<Slaughter Points Rewarded: 370>\n<Special Reward: 10 Special Store Tickets; 100 Star Points>\nHearing the rewards Leonel was given, everyone who had been looking toward him in shock suddenly went green with envy.\nThey had all been here when the Merlin Trial moderator had said that Leonel could stand to receive ten times the rewards should he succeed in passing this Random Event. However, seeing it displayed before them now made them feel as though their innards were being twisted with countless little blades.\nSo what if the reward had a multiplier to it? In order to benefit, Leonel would have had to survive, and none of them believed that he would do so.\nYet, not only had he survived, but he had only returned with barely over half a dozen people. Of the over 40 that went, so little actually returned!\nKing Arthur abruptly stood, his gaze turning red as he looked toward Leonel.\nNo matter how he swept his gaze, no matter how many times he double and triple checked… Lamorak was gone! His brother in arms for so many years, one of the 12 men he trusted his whole life to… gone!\nHe didn't fall during war, nor beneath a siege of demons or the hands of Modred… but he fell to the hands of a boy that didn't even have to be their enemy!\nKing Arthur's chest heaved, but it had a slowly, rhythmic beat to it. He looked like a beast suppressing his strength, using all of his will to temper down his rage as he stared daggers toward Leonel.\nAt that moment, an unconcealed kingly might exuded from his body. It was the kind that left those who were too weak stifled. Any lesser man or woman would fall to their knees. However, everyone here was an elite of the elite. Even if they felt pressured, they could forcibly withstand it.\nThat said… they couldn't say the same if they were the target of this pressure like Leonel was. Yet, the boy stood there and met Arthur's gaze with his own, remaining expressionless. He didn't say any words of taunting nor bravado, yet his presence alone seemed to be enough of a slap to the face.\nTo Leonel, this was what King Arthur deserved.\nA pillar of blinding golden light descended upon Leonel from above. He couldn't bother to care for King Arthur's emotions anymore and could only focus on accepting this reward.\nMuch like all his other rewards, this recovery reward had a ten times multiplier as well. This singular reward was as good as receiving ten Perfect Evaluation rewards, so Leonel would take full advantage.\nHe circulated Merlin's meditation technique. With each rotation, he felt his Force and Soul Force become more compact and sturdy.\nIn the past, even when he sent his Internal Sight into his body to monitor his Nodes, he would only see faint wisps of Force. It couldn't be helped. His Force Nodes were measured in lengths of singular cells. The fact he could sense Force at all was a testament to how talented his sensory abilities were.\nBut now, Leonel could sense a heavy flow within his body. Though it wasn't as exaggerated as turning to liquid, what it did become was a thick fog.\nLeonel realized that this thickening not only increased the amount of Force he had, but also made it easier to control. He no longer had to rely on a faint sense of where his Force was and what it was doing. It was now as bright as day to him.\nIn addition to helping him meditate, this reward was a great help toward healing his lingering injuries. Though [Grand Heal] was excellent, it hadn't been able to completely solve all of Leonel's troubles.\nIn fact, if Leonel thought about it, it actually did much more for him than he thought it would. He could only chalk it up to his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor.\nThis aside, this reward helped him not have to worry about hidden injuries. And, as an added surprise, Leonel realized that the injury of his body followed by the thorough healing of it actually helped the Urbe Essence within his body to fuse with him even better. He felt that he was already faintly reaching the peak of the Standard Stage and might even have another breakthrough soon.\nJust the Standard Stage alone was enough for Leonel to resist Lamorak's barrage for several minutes and that was without activating his Runes. He couldn't even imagine what would happen if he broke through again. Would it even be possible for anyone within the Third Dimension to hurt him at all?\n'Just a little more, just a little more…'\nLeonel had no idea that others were looking toward him with a bit of fear in their eyes.\nWhile he was completely focused on accepting his reward and compressing his Force so that he would have enough assurance to form his Tenth Node, others were looking at him like some sort of monster.\nThey could all tell that Leonel was in the process of compressing his Internal Strength, but that was exactly what made them shudder. To receive the reward was one thing, but to be able to accept it was an entirely different matter. Was this boy's body made of metal?!\nHowever, Leonel didn't know about their worries, nor would he care even if he did know.\nNormally, it took decades of meditation to reach Lamorak's level not only because meditation was slow, but because it took time for the body to acclimate to thicker Force. However, Leonel didn't need this acclimation time. After all… he was a scion of the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor.\nA violent surge of wind kicked up around Leonel as he took a deep breath and opened his eyes. For a moment, his irises seemed to shine with a bright light before dimming back down to their usual pale green.\nThen, without sparing those watching him a glance, he used one of his Special Store Tickets and disappeared. Since he could hide his purchases from them… why not? It might give him a small edge for a while. After all, there was no other archer even close to his level at the moment.\nWhen Leonel entered the Special Store, he was faced with an immediate dilemma.\nHe had 100 000 skill points right now, 470 000 if he converted all of his slaughter points and 570 000 if he converted all of his star points as well.\nThe question was whether he should buy the goddess necklace he was eyeing before or not…",

      "content": "<Treading Goddess Necklace (Legendary Equipment) - 72 000 skill points>\nThough Leonel could be considered to be a rich man now, he knew that he had to be cautious with how he used his skill points. Another Random Event wasn't going to come any time soon, especially since Leonel felt as though something was artificially accelerating these trials along. Whether it was how quickly the first Elimination Round came or the fact a Random Event was triggered at all, both were signs that these Merlin Trials just might not last as long as they had in the past.\nAll of these treasures seemed blinding to the eye, but Leonel knew well that they were practically useless to him. After he left this Zone, they would all disappear. So, wasting time on them was exactly that… a waste.\nThe only value this necklace had to him was in his Dream Sculpt ability. But, if he used all of these skill points, Leonel knew he would be able to unlock at least two of the four seasons. That kind of boost to his strength couldn't be looked down upon at all.\nThis seemed like a smarter choice, but Leonel hesitated again.\n'370 slaughter points is so many… it would be quite literally impossible for me to gather this much again.'\nLeonel wasn't wrong. There were only about 200 warriors that entered the trials this time around. By all logic, gathering this many again would be impossible unless another multiplier event was given. But, even if that did happen, there was no guarantee that Leonel would be the one to benefit this time. He had gotten lucky this time, but that didn't mean there would be a next time.\nPlus, there was also the fact that Leonel couldn't run from the fact he almost died. Had he not reached the Standard Stage in thanks to Merlin's Recovery Rewards or had Lamorak not been a blunt weapon wielder, who knew how things might have turned out?\nIt seemed smarter to just wait. What if the exchange rate for slaughter points increased again to 10 000 to 1? If that happened, Leonel could clear his whole skill tree with ease.\nLeonel took a deep breath.\nThis choice was definitely a difficult one.\nLeonel looked down at the napping little mink in his arms. The little guy had gained a recovery reward through him, so his situation was much better than it had been in the past.\nAfter a while, Leonel made a decision.\nHe converted 170 of his slaughter points into skill points. Then…\n<Silver Skill 'Secondary Explosion' Chosen>\n…\n<Gold Skill 'Frightful Barrage' Chosen>\n<Gold Skill 'Knuckle Shot' Chosen>\n<Gold Skill 'Illusion Shot' Chosen>\n…\n<Legend Skill 'Winter' Chosen>\nA menacing cold suddenly swept around Leonel and through his bones. He felt as though his whole world had been cast into an endless white filled with nothing but a chilling bite.\nLeonel's gaze went blank for a moment.\n'Artistic Conception…'\nThese words were whispered into his mind.\nThe universe was filled with all sorts of beautiful mysteries. The birth of a child, the budding of a flower, the rise of the sun… If one had to describe why each one of these was beautiful, it might be difficult to do.\nThis sort of clear but difficult to grasp, comprehend and describe beauty… This was Artistic Conception.\nWhen one listened to a musical score. The feelings that welled up in the heart, the emotions that prayed on our deepest desires, the lurking memories that surged up from our subconscious… This was Artistic Conception.\nThis was where the strength of the Universe Cycles lay. Everyone could see the beauty in the seasons, but how many could capture them? How many could relay the beauty they saw to others? How many could make the Four Seasons their own?\nA thin layer of frost began to form around Leonel, coating his hair and his brows while even turning his lips a vague shade of blue.\nIt was only after a long while that he awoke. But the look within his eyes seemed to have grown several levels deeper, as though there was unknown and unfathomable depths hidden within their pupils.\n'So this is the Four Seasons Realm…'\nLeonel was shocked. It wasn't by the power, but because of just how much the Four Seasons Realm reminded him of his Dreamscape Battle Sense.\nIt was a hard to describe feeling and even more difficult for Leonel to fully grasp. But, he felt like there was a thin, translucent line connecting the two that he couldn't quite put his finger on.\nIn fact… He vaguely felt that his Dreamscape Battle Sense was even a level more powerful.\nIf others heard Leonel's thoughts, they would think he was a madman. But, this was simply how he felt…\nOf course, Leonel still knew that his Dreamscape Battle Sense was lacking in many expects. For example, the efficiency was too low, almost like a written code that used up too much of a computer's memory. An elegant piece of code and a complex one could both execute the same task, but the former would always be faster and less strenuous.\nLeonel felt like he was in the same situation now. His Dreamscape Battle Sense was an excellent technique, but the organization of his skills was lacking. Due to this, it took too much of his Soul Force to pick out the perfect technique to respond with and as such, it drained him too quickly.\nIn addition to this, this was just 'Reliant Artistic Conception'. Leonel was relying on the comprehensions of someone else right now, so how could this possibly represent the true strength of the Four Seasons Realm?\nPlus… Leonel didn't necessarily feel like he had to choose one or the other…\nIf his Dreamscape Battle Sense and his Universe Cycle comprehension could be fused into one… just what kind of monster would he become?\nLeonel took a deep breath and left the Special Store.",

      "content": "When Leonel appeared, everyone felt the change within him. They could all sense the biting wind and the chilling aura. It was as though his will was being manifested in tangible form.\nThose who knew what this meant looked on in shock. It was precisely because they knew exactly what they were seeing that they felt as though their understanding of the world had been turned upside down.\nComprehending the Four Seasons Realm was one matter, but manifesting this understanding so clearly for all to see was a completely different matter. It was easier to accomplish this when it was one's own comprehension. But, when relying on the comprehension of another, this feat became several times more difficult.\nThe fact Leonel could do this was too confusing. Even King Arthur didn't know what exactly it meant.\nHowever… it could be said that if those of the Morales Clan were present, their shock would be no less.\nUnfortunately, no one had the time to think about their next move.\n<Milestone Reached: Legendary Skill has been acquired>\n<Trial 4 has been postponed, Elimination Round commencing>\n<Elimination Goal: 20>\nThe small grey platforms began to rumble.\n<Second Elimination Round — Begin!>\nThis time, Leonel was ready. As he fell toward the massive gray platform beneath him, his gaze was like lightning, seeing through the intentions of all those around him.\nStill, he couldn't help but smile bitterly. Only a fool wouldn't be able to tell exactly who it was had just awakened the Legendary Skill.\nSHUUUUUUUUUU!\nLeonel's pupils constricted.\nThree arrows came at him from three different directions. It was as though everyone had come to a tacit understanding that he was the greatest threat. But, this time, there was no Little Nana by his side and the little mink was currently sleeping within the Segmented Cube.\nHowever, Leonel didn't panic.\nDuring the Random Event, Leonel had cast [Grand Heal]. But, by all rights, he shouldn't have been able to. After all, within the Merlin Trials, the only skills one was allowed to use were the ones they unlocked with skill points. And, since Leonel had chosen a bow as his main weapon, he obviously couldn't cast spells like those who had chosen wands.\nYet, he had done so anyway.\nThe real question was… how?\nThe answer to that was simple: his Lineage Factors.\nJust like these Trials couldn't stifle his ability, it couldn't hold back his Lineage Factors either. In that life or death situation, Leonel realized that when he used his Lineage Factor as a medium, casting spells he hadn't been able to before was as easy as breathing.\nLeonel's lip curled, beautiful Bronze Runes spreading across his body.\n\"[Grand Bell Construct]!\"\nForce surged around Leonel as a massive illusory bell formed around him in the blink of an eye.\n[Grand Bell Construct] was one of the few Three Star Earth Magus Arts that didn't rely on the earth beneath one's feet to form. It coalesced pure Earth Force into a transparent bell that surrounded the caster. Even though it wasn't the most powerful defensive Art, its utility made it perfect for the battlefield.\nPENG! PENG! PENG!\nThree arrows rebounded off of Leonel's [Grand Bell Construct].\nThe instant his feet landed on the ground, Leonel drew his bow in a forceful arc.\nIn quick succession he unleash the Gold Skill 'Knuckle Shot' in one direction and the Gold Skill 'Illusion Shot' in another. With a swing of his hips, his gaze locked onto the last archer. Even from so far away, he could see the fear in the latter's eyes.\nHe wasn't a demon. He was a normal human man wearing the shining armor of a knight. Knights who chose to be bowman were rare, but they were also incredibly powerful within their class. They could be considered rare elites an army couldn't do without, aces of archery.\nEven as Leonel released the last arrow, he could only sigh. He didn't want to kill humans, but why did they insist on targeting him?\nEveryone was stunned by Leonel's sudden counterattack. They were all elites, how could they not recognize the spell Leonel had just used.\nIn this sort of situation, [Grand Bell Construct] was too perfect. Not only did it provide good defense, but it also allowed Leonel's attacks to pass through from the inside completely unhindered. Though it gave up some defensive strength in order to allow this, its utility in the midst of battle was completely unmatched.\nHowever, whatever success Leonel had didn't last for long.\nAt that moment, a towering aura shot through the skies. Even Leonel couldn't help but turn his head toward a certain direction. Despite the fact he could just as easily lock onto this person with his Internal Sight, it felt that it was improper of him to do so.\nIt was no surprise to Leonel that this towering aura was coming from King Arthur.\nClad in white armor fitted with roaring white tigers, his blond hair billowed beneath his surging aura. The sword in his right hand seemed to shimmer like the brightest gold.\nEvery step he took caused the platform to quake.\nWith reddened eyes, he slowly walked toward Leonel. No matter who he came across chose to take a step out of his way. Not a single person seemed to want to get in his way at this very moment.\nThe humans of Camelot looked toward Leonel with reddened eyes. Their rage could be imagined.\nHow long had the Knights of the Round Table held up the hope of their nation? How much had they taken on their shoulders?\nAll of them were brothers in arms. Yet, for Lamorak to fall not at the hand of a Demon, but a fellow human… it ate at their hearts and organs, making them shed hot tears.\nIn Camelot, the tears of men were rare. Maybe this was the same no matter which society it was.\nWith rarity came a certain heaviness. It was a weight that suffocated the atmosphere, bearing down on it until even the air one breathed felt like scorching lava.\nAs a King, Arthur couldn't shed the tears he wanted to. He put the whole of his rage into his sword, causing a Sword Force that could cut mountains to sing through the skies.\nHe wanted Leonel dead.. He wouldn't rest until he was.",

      "content": "Leonel calmly watched as Arthur built momentum, dispelling [Grand Bell Construct].\nSince he wanted to fight, Leonel would fight. He felt no sadness nor any remorse. Lamorak deserved to die.\nLeonel took a step forward, his aura billowing upward, clashing with Arthur's. A surging violet aura stood above his head, fusing with his halo. In that moment, even King Arthur's felt stifled.\nIn a corner of the platform, Modred watch on with twinkling eyes. Despite the fact her father was so enraged, she didn't seem to feel any sort of particular way about it. She watched on like any other normal spectator.\nIn truth, she was the most curious about Leonel. It seemed that her favorite lover in recent months actually seemed to have quite some history with this boy. But, she still couldn't understand how they were related.\nThough Monet tried to hide it, it was pretty obvious to Modred. This was especially so after that Big Buddha character didn't come back from the Random Event.\nModred smiled. The contrast of her cherry lips to her pale features was especially striking.\n\"It seems you all have forgotten about me.\"\nHer voice was especially sweet, but it was barbed with the thorns of a rose.\nShe raised her wand, her slender fingers wrapping around it.\n\"Darling Monet, protect me.\"\nMonet nodded, brandishing her fire coated whip.\nKing Arthur's expression changed. \"You dare?!\"\nModred smiled as though she hadn't heard a thing, a violent dark energy surging around her.\nShe needed slaughter points. Why would she wait around for a stupid battle of manly pride to finish? Since King Arthur wasn't paying attention to her anymore, this was the perfect chance for her to act.\nModred tapped forward with her wand.\nAt that instant, the sphere of blackness around her shot outward like the spikes of a porcupine.\nAgonizing screams sounded as several warriors were torn apart. In the blink of an eye, half a dozen had fallen and over a dozen more were varying degrees of injured.\nKing Arthur's face flushed red with rage, veins bulging out from his handsome face. Without a choice, he charged back toward Modred. If he didn't hold her back, there was no one else who could. Even the five remaining Knights of the Round Table he had come with could only be toyed around with by her. Only Lamorak and Lancelot could last a few rounds with her but… he had frozen Lancelot out and Lamorak was dead…\nUnfortunately for King Arthur, there was still Monet. And since Monet had acted, Violet Rain who had maintained a low profile all this time could only act as well.\nMonet's whip seemed to cover the skies. Even from over 20 meters away, she kept King Arthur at bay under the support of Violet Rain.\n'She's this powerful…?'\nLeonel's expression changed. He suddenly realized that Monet was no weaker than Lamorak.\nMost of Lamorak's strength came from his compressed Force. Obviously, Monet hadn't compressed her own Force as much as Lamorak had. But, her ability more than made up for it.\nDepending on the strength of one's ability, it might not even matter whether one reached the Four Seasons Realm or not. It would still be possible to display grand power beyond one's imagining.\nIn addition, it was clear that, much like Hacker Hutch, Monet had been training in the whip since long before the Metamorphosis descended.\nKing Arthur was completely enraged. His kingly aura fluctuated wildly, his sword swinging with a mighty momentum as he tried to cross Monet's barrier.\nUnfortunately, it was simply too difficult. He had to separate a portion of his Force to fuse with his armor and block Violet Rain's poison.\nHe was certain that if he was given enough time, he could easily reach Modred. The issue was that he didn't have the time.\nWhen Modred acted, the whole of the grey platform descended into chaos. King Arthur had only cut the distance by half when a familiar voice sounded once again.\n<Second Elimination Round Completed>\n<Slaughter Points to be Distributed>\n<Modred - 13 points>\n<Leonel - 3 points>\n…\nThe 100 star points above Leonel's head flickered and disappeared under the unwilling gazes of all those around him. It was obvious that this was probably a large part of the reason he was targeted at all. But, the archers who had chosen to take action had clearly been too eager. What would they have done had they really managed to kill him?\nKing Arthur's steps paused, a bubbling rage threatening to erupt from deep within him.\nHe stared toward Modred then looked toward the corpses of his fellow man that littered the ground.\nOver 200 people had entered together. But, now there were just 72. Just 72 left. Of them, only 40 were humans.\n<Trial 4 Commencing>\nUnfortunately, no matter how enraged King Arthur was, things were destined to continue. The same callous voice sounded as though the deaths that had been caused by it were completely meaningless.\nLeonel shook his head. It was for the best that things ended this way. His mission would fail if King Arthur died and having to fight such a powerful man while holding back would be like asking for death.\nJust as Leonel was about to check to see if the exchange rate for slaughter points had changed, his vision swam.\nAt first he panicked. But, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't seem to keep himself awake.\nSoon, his panic became languidness and his vision went completely black. The only assurance he gained just before he lost consciousness was that others seemed to be falling asleep along with him…\n…\nMoments later, Leonel appeared floating within a cocoon. There wasn't a shred of clothing on him and he was curled up in a fetal position.\nWhat was truly shocking, though, about his current situation was the fact he wasn't alone. There was one other cocoon right next to him. But, this one held a gorgeous woman who was equally as naked.\nIn fact, even that wasn't the truly shocking part.. What would stun those watching from a third party's perspective was the fact that this woman was the demonic Empress, Modred.",

      "content": "Leonel felt his vision blur. When it cleared again, he was shocked to find that he was a bird in the skies. The suddenness caught him off guard, causing him to almost plummet from the clouds entirely.\nAfter he regained his bearings and figured out how his wings seemed to work, Leonel soon realized that he eyes seemed capable of peering through everything. Whether it was seeing to the ground as though it was right before him or even seeing through the walls of tall buildings, he could do it all. In fact, he realized that if he focused, he could even filter out noise and focus on individual conversations.\n'This must be the fourth trial? But what am I supposed to do?'\nAll of the trials up to this point had been related to battle. Leonel had been entirely prepared for another long drawn out battle, he never expected to be thrusted into a place like this.\nStill, Leonel realized that he had to remain calm.\nTo this point, the only trial the voice of the Merlin Trials actually explained was the Random Event. Outside of this, everything else was figured out by the contestants themselves. As much as this was a trial of brawn, it was also one that tested one's observational abilities.\nThinking to this point, Leonel began to focus on the task at hand.\nThe first thing he realized after a long while was that the city he was restricted to flying above was definitely Camelot. Normally, it wouldn't take him so long to realize something like this. The reason it did this time around was because of two factors: for one, he wasn't used to seeing Camelot from such a vantage point. And secondly… this Camelot wasn't exactly like the one he had come to know.\nFrom Leonel's observations, he believed that this Camelot was displaced through time. It was either a version of the Kingdom from the past or from the future. Judging by the overall smaller scope, Leonel concluded that this was more likely a Camelot of the past, probably a few decades younger than the Camelot he had come to know.\n'Why would this trial send me to Camelot's past?'\nLeonel's heart was a bit perturbed.\nHe still remembered the trial he had to complete. His main trial was to save King Arthur. His two side quests were to kill Modred and resolve the love triangle. And, finally, the hidden quest was to make Camelot a part of true history.\nAt this point, with how difficult everything had become, Leonel had resigned himself to not perfectly clearing this Zone. As long as he saved King Arthur, he would be able to leave here alive.\nHowever, recently, Leonel realized a problem with that line of thinking.\nThis was an SS-grade Zone. This meant that the reward for clearing the main quest was a Tier 8 Black treasure. However, he needed a Tier 9 Black treasure in order to exchange for a ticket to another world.\nThis realization frustrated Leonel. In order to get a reward a tier above the difficulty of the Zone, he needed to complete the harder of the two side quests. But, with his current relationship with King Arthur, how the hell was he supposed to help fix his marriage? Was that a joke?\nThis ultimately left Leonel with only one choice: even if he failed both side quests, he needed to find a way to complete the hidden quest. Only then would he be able to exchange for what he needed.\nOf course, since this Zone had a 12 person entry limit, it was still possible for Leonel to exchange five Tier 8 rewards for one Tier 9 reward. However, Leonel didn't want to put his hope into this. There were still Monet, Violet Rain and Little Nana who remained alive. This meant that the rewards would be split between the four of them.\nIn that case, even if they managed to clear the main quest, Leonel would only have three Tier 8 rewards which wouldn't be enough.\nOf course, he thought of killing Monet and Violet Rain, but he chose against doing so. Though he had no love lost between himself and Monet, Violet Rain had never acted against him. Even if he considered the matters of the tournament, those were just minor inconveniences. She never harmed his life.\nHe would never cross his own bottom line just for the sake of a reward. And, even if he killed Monet alone, that would only give him four rewards to exchange. He would still fall short so there was no need to risk himself to kill such a powerful woman.\nThere was another matter that Leonel had been reluctant to think about. If he didn't get the ticket to Terrain, he would be in mortal danger after he left this Zone. How could the Slayer Legion possibly let him off so easily?\nSo why was Leonel thinking about all of this now? Other than the fact it was related to his life and death? It was precisely because the oddity of this trial was the first chance he saw that just might be related to his hidden quest. If he was lucky, it might even let him understand how to fix King Arthur's marriage without the need to befriend the man.\nLeonel realized that this trial was his chance.\nHis gaze sharpened as he focused his everything on finding the clues he needed.\n'Hm?'\nLeonel's hawk eyes lit up.\nWhen observing such a large area, it was difficult to tell what was important to pay attention to. Leonel had listened in on way too many useless conversations about the weather or stumbled into some not so wholesome displays of affection.\nHowever, he realized that there would always be clues that pointed him toward particular main events.\nFor example, he stumbled onto many conversations about the exploits of Lancelot. It turned out that he recently killed the Demon Emperor. Leonel wasn't sure who this Demon Emperor was, but in all likelihood, he was the leader of the Demons before Modred.\nAnother hot topic he stumbled into was information about the recent closure of the Merlin Trials. It appeared that Lancelot, Queen Guinevere and King Arthur were the ones who gained the most.\nFrom this, Leonel understood that this was at least four to five decades ago. The last opening of the Merlin Trials was 50 or so years ago, so for it to still be such a hot topic, Leonel was sure that it ended quite recently.\nStill, there was one event that was spoken the most about. It overshadowed all others.\nThe Queen was giving birth.\nHowever, there was a problem with this information that made Leonel raise an eyebrow. Lionus was in his 20's, not much older than Leonel himself. If not for this, he'd be much more powerful and would have been allowed by his father to participate.\nSo who was the Queen giving birth to over four decades ago?",

      "content": "Leonel realized that this birth must be the main event of this world. So, he focused in on the castle.\nLeonel was shocked to find that the instant he did, time accelerated around him.\n'This is a good thing.' Leonel concluded. 'It must mean I'm on the right track.'\nThough time accelerated, Leonel caught everything that occurred. Everything unrelated to the birth was cut out, but Leonel was able to capture everything about the birth itself.\nHe saw the happiness of the King and Queen. He saw the difficulty of the birth. He saw how Queen Guinevere almost lost her life giving birth to this child. And, he finally saw the child being born…\nA beautiful little baby with large black eyes.\nUnfortunately, this baby was sickly. She had overly pale skin and a feeble breath. She would often nap for long portions of the day, only letting the world see her large, blinking eyes for a few minutes a day.\nArthur and Guinevere were devastated. As the most powerful pair of mother and father in the land, how could they not pour their everything into the health of their baby girl?\nAt that time, after exhausting all their options, they turned their attention to the budding religion of the land, led by a Pope who was rumored to be even more talented than King Arthur himself in the Light Element.\n\"Pope Margrave, please do your best.\"\nQueen Guinevere held the little baby girl in her arms. By now, the little girl was already two years old, yet her development was severely stunted. Despite already having grown to the age of a toddler, she had yet to be capable of walking on her own and her size alone made it seem as though she was still a newborn.\nThis left the two new parents completely heartbroken. They didn't understand what they had done wrong.\nEven when their little girl had been in the womb, they had traveled far and wide to find treatments to take care of her. Guinevere had been fed the best tonics and given the best medicines for all nine months. They hadn't missed a day of nurturing their child.\nYet, their little girl had come out like this. How could they not be heartbroken?\nPope Margrave looked just as handsome as he always did, but a hint of immaturity marred the momentum of his dignity. He smiled lightly toward the two parents and spoke.\n\"I am of course willing to do my best. I only hope that the Royal Family will protect The Church. We only hope to spread our beliefs to the people.\"\nKing Arthur's expression slightly hardened.\nHis Kingdom was just budding. Though religion could help to stabilize the people, it could also serve as an adverse variable. The faith of the common people was a hard thing to overcome. If it was weaponized… the consequences could be imagined.\nHowever, when Arthur looked toward the tear stricken face of his wife and his frail child, his heart wavered.\n\"You have This King's word.\" Arthur spoke resolutely.\nPope Margrave smiled and nodded, taking the little girl into his arm.\nLeonel watched the next sequence of events with shock. Arthur and Guinevere believed that their little girl was being treated with Light Elemental magic, but this wasn't the case at all.\nWhen he had left the eye of the family, Pope Margrave brought the little baby girl to a quiet room.\n\"… [Twisted World].\"\nLeonel watched as a surge of darkness shot up around Margrave. The room that had once been bathed in light became surrounded by darkness.\nLeonel panicked slightly, thinking that the Pope was going to harm the little baby girl. He had unknowingly become attached. He even wanted to see the little baby girl become better.\nHowever, deep inside, he knew that it was impossible. He had already been to the future. It was either this little girl died or she became…\nLeonel sighed.\nThe latter was confirmed by what happened next. Rather than being harmed, the little girl which had been napping suddenly became lively. Her sickly little body gained some strength and even let out an adorable little giggle. It was the kind of childish laughter that could warm the heart of even the most cold individual.\nShe raised up her little hands, grasping at Pope Margrave's face.\nPope Margrave smiled and let the child play with his finger. He seemed to get a slight happiness from the little girl's eagerness.\nLeonel finally understood.\nHe had watched it all from start to finish. It was true that King Arthur and Queen Guinevere had done everything they could to nurture their little baby girl. But, all this time, they had always used the Light Element. Whether it was the tonics Guinevere drank or the medicines she ate, all of them were of this element.\nIt wasn't really their fault. From their understanding, the Light Element was the best at healing. In their narrow world view, it was likely that if they hadn't done all of this, their little girl would have died even sooner or been even worse off.\nBut… the truth was that their little girl was healthy. In fact, it was their fault that she was sickly at all. Had they not been feeding her medicines from her opposing element for so long, this little girl would have been just fine. In fact, quite ironically, had they been neglectful parents, the little girl would have been in an even better position than she was now.\nWhen the Pope came out with their little girl and the mother-father pair saw how much more lively their little girl was, they couldn't help but shed tears. Even King Arthur, who hadn't cried even when Lamorak died, felt his eyes water.\nThey profusely thank Pope Margrave and put their all into helping The Church grow. All of the worries Arthur had were thrown out of the window. Who cared if he was raising a wolf in his own den? As long as his baby girl was healthy, he didn't care about anything else.\nCamelot celebrated as their little princess grew. The worries they had about the little one not making any appearances vanished with the wind.\nEverything was perfect… until the little princess came of age and had her affinity tested…",

      "content": "The idea of someone standing against the world seemed like something great and valiant to do. Just thinking about it made one's blood boil. There were maybe few other things that could elicit a person's pride than this.\nHowever, what if the person tasked with such a thing was just a little girl of barely ten years old? What if she was subject to the silence of all the most powerful men and women of a Kingdom, all of whom were staring down toward her with varying expressions…\nShock… Apprehension… Disgust…\nThe little princess stood in a flowing white dress, her innocent faint still smiling as she placed her little hands on a crystal three times the size of her body. Her large black eyes sparkled as she watched the flowing black lights. It all looked particularly beautiful to her.\nShe didn't seem to notice the reaction of those around her. She was simply ignorant to them. Her mind was still a blank slate. How could she ever think that she would be shunned by something completely out of her control?\n\"Wow, pretty!\"\nThe little princess giggled.\nIt was the same giggle that caused the hearts of those around her to flutter. It even cracked the expressions of those that were looking toward her little body with disgust.\nKing Arthur and Queen Guinevere looked toward their daughter with shock, not able to understand what they were seeing.\nKing Arthur was a Light Magus, a talent rarely seen across several centuries.\nQueen Guinevere was a Water Magus. She too was a rare talent and even awakened a Variant Affinity that tended toward ice.\nHow the daughter that was the product of their union could possibly be a Dark Magus was completely unknown to them. Was this what they called fate?\nTears fell down Guinevere's delicate features as she kneeled down and hugged her daughter who was still ignorant to how her life had just changed. As for King Arthur, he didn't know how to react.\nHis first instinct was guilt. It was he who insisted on making their daughter's affinity ceremony a public event. He thought that this would be a great opportunity to affirm the standing of their Royal Family.\nThough he hadn't known his daughter's affinity, he was certain that she was very talented. Ever since Pope Margrave began to heal her, she displayed an intelligence and wit far beyond her age. There had never been a doubt in Arthur's mind.\nMaybe somewhat ironically, he had been correct. Those halos of light and those cracks spreading across the crystal's face made it all very obvious. Not only was his daughter a Childe, she was a monster even amongst Childes.\nBut the reality of it was cruel.\n\"Mommy? Why are you crying?\"\nThe little princess blinked, unable to understand what was happening. It was only then that she took her eyes off the pretty lights and saw the eyes everyone used to look at her.\nSeeing the array of emotions, her little heart trembled. Even if she was mostly ignorant of the ways of the world, she was still an intelligent little girl.\n\"Mommy… Did I do something wrong?\"\nHearing these words, Queen Guinevere felt her heart breaking.\n\"You're all dismissed.\" King Arthur finally spoke, his expression not giving way for anyone to respond.\nThose of the court left one after another.\nLeonel shook his head, watching all of this from start to finish. Was this how superstition worked? Even to the point of forsaking one's own daughter? If it wasn't for the fact the little princess was in fact a princess, maybe she would have been killed on the spot...\nUnfortunately for the little girl, things weren't ending here, they were only beginning.\n…\n\"What did you just say to me?! You want my daughter to do what?!\"\nQueen Guinevere's words came out in a hoarse screech. She couldn't believe the words she was hearing.\nNo, it wasn't that she couldn't believe them, but rather that she didn't believe who they were coming from.\nHow could the man she loved say such words? Was this really the same man who she shared a child with?\nKing Arthur was taken aback by his wife's reaction. Had what he said really been so bad? He couldn't help but take offense.\n\"Guinevere, why are you acting like this? I only want to protect our daughter.\"\n\"By keeping her out of the public eye?\" Guinevere's lips curled into a sneer. \"All you want to do is protect your precious Kingdom. If you have to sacrifice your daughter's freedom and happiness, you wouldn't mind, right?!\"\n\"Guinevere! You're living in a fantasy land! Do you really think it's possible for her to live a normal life right now? What kind of freedom could there possibly be in her situation?!\"\n\"Her? You can't even say your own daughter's name anymore? Does she disgust you now too?!\"\nKing Arthur's eyes reddened with rage. Why wouldn't this woman listen to what he was saying?!\n\"This decision is final!\" He roared.\nGuinevere's sneer only deepened. A deep divide seemed to split the two despite the fact they still stood within the same room.\n\"Please do put your foot down, oh esteemed Majesty. This is what you always wanted, right? The power to stand over and rule the world? But don't you find it a little sad that you spent all this time fighting for this power, and now you're so scared to lose it that you don't even dare to stand beside your own daughter.\n\"What a Great King you are.\"\nGuinevere's words held a biting a cold to it. Her irises involuntarily shone a bright blue as she momentarily lost control of her own magic.\nKing Arthur seemed stunned by what he had just heard. His chest heaved but he didn't have the words to reply.\nHe stormed out of the room, the boom of the closing door resonating throughout the castle.\n…\nUltimately, King Arthur's words were final.\nLeonel watched as the little princess grew up. He watched her optimism wither and her liveliness dim.\nThe palace maids seemed to keep a wide berth. Her own father was too ashamed to see her. Her mother was the only light in her life, but the pain of the splintering relationship with her husband left even her as a mere shell of her former self.\nIt could only be said that the little girl was alone.",

      "content": "Leonel watched the life of this little princess until the day she chose to leave the Kingdom. With her father estranged and her mother unable to provide the same warmth she once had, the one to ultimately suffer the most was a young girl who knew nothing of the world but the same coldness.\nAt that moment, Leonel felt his world swim once again.\nWhen his gaze cleared, he found himself floating within a cocoon, facing a young woman that was in the same position. However, while he was awake, she seemed to still be in a deep sleep.\nThe cocoon around Leonel popped.\nFirst his clothing came back, then all of his equipment. Even the bow weighed heavily in Leonel's hand.\nBy now, Leonel had gained a faint understanding of the trial. He was meant to understand and empathize with his opponent. The faster he did so, the faster he would awaken and the greater advantage he would gain.\nIf he wanted to win, all he had to do was put an arrow through Modred's head. She couldn't resist him even if she wanted to, she was clearly still immersed in what he assumed were memories of his life.\nLeonel sighed. 'What a cruel trial…'\nLeonel didn't particularly understand what the point of this trial was. Did Merlin want to show him that the people he killed to gain the rewards he had were people too? Did Merlin want him to understand his enemy before he killed him? Was there another purpose Leonel had yet to think of?\nLeonel knew that killing Modred now would be too beneficial to him.\nIf he killed Modred and killed Monet before he left this place, that would allow him exactly the five rewards he needed to exchange for a Tier 9 reward.\nLeonel sighed again, closing his eyes. He didn't even need to think about it, he knew that he couldn't do it.\nHe wasn't na?ve enough to believe that Modred was a good person just because she had a tragic backstory. No matter how understanding he was, it was still clear and obvious to him that her actions in the past several decades had definitely caused a lot of pain to a lot of people.\nThough Modred looked like a young woman, she was definitely over 40 years old. Even if he saw the reflection of that little girl within her, Leonel knew that she was no longer than innocent little girl and shouldn't be treated as such.\nStill, Leonel had his own bottom line. So, he waited.\nSeconds turned to minutes, then hours, and even days.\nLeonel knew that Modred's challenge was comparatively more difficult than his own. Leonel's childhood was on Earth which had a population of billions. Just finding his storyline would be difficult let alone coming to understand his world.\nMerlin had definitely not accounted for this possibility in his trials. Leonel wasn't from their world, so how could it not be far more difficult?\nPlus, Leonel's ability was especially suited to taking in and organizing information. This sort of trial where he was required to filter out the unnecessary and focus in on the important was practically created for him.\nIt wasn't until an entire week later that Modred's lashes finally fluttered. She slowly opened her eyes, the cocoon she was in breaking to reveal her defined body which was quickly wrapped up in a long, flowing black dress.\nHer gaze flashed with a hint of surprise when she saw Leonel calmly meditating before her. He hadn't opened his eyes even after she awoke, but Modred could tell that he was already on high alert.\nAfter a moment, she came to understand what must have happened. After all, she could draw the same conclusions Leonel could.\n\"You know, boy, having sympathy for an enemy is as good as asking for death.\"\nModred spoke lightly. Her tone didn't carry any gratefulness nor was it laced with any of the relief one should have upon escaping death by the hair of their teeth. It was obvious to any semi intelligent individual that Leonel had shown mercy. But, Modred's disregard for her own life was even more surprising.\nLeonel slowly opened his eyes when he heard Modred speak.\n\"Some people would call me quite foolish, yes.\"\n\"Some?\" Modred asked with an enchanting smile. \"I think even the few that would do as you did would still call it foolish.\"\nLeonel looked toward Modred for a long while seemingly trying to see through her. Finally, he stood, brandishing his bow.\n\"Shall we fight?\"\n\"Why so soon?\" Modred asked lightly. \"I'm very curious about the world you are from. Just what sort of place is it?\"\nLeonel didn't know how to respond to this. Was he supposed to tell Modred that the pain she suffered as a child was just a fanciful story woven by writers? Would anyone be able to accept that about their lives?\n\"If things go well, then you'll get to experience it for yourself.\" Leonel finally said.\nLeonel had deliberated over this answer for a long while. He didn't think that there was anything particularly important about his choice of words, he just didn't know how to explain himself so this was all he could say.\nHowever, what he could have never expected was for the whole of the Trial Grounds to suddenly tremble fiercely the moment he spoke the last of his sentence.\nLeonel's expression changed. He shot a glance over to Modred, but he found that she was just as confused as he was. It was clear that she also had no idea what was going on.\nWithout a choice, Leonel pulled out the dictionary. He had to know if the situation had changed.\n\"What's happening?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, Hidden Quest has been completed. The world of Camelot is integrating with Earth's Fold of Reality. ]\nLeonel stood frozen.\nWhat? How could something like this happen?\nOut of all the possibilities, out of all the thoughts he had, out of all the ways he thought things could go… this was the absolute very last thing he had even considered.\nThe world continued to rumble as Leonel clutched his bow.. He really had no idea what would happen next.",

      "content": "Leonel wasn't sure if this was a good thing or a bad thing.\nWhat did it mean for Camelot to integrate with Earth's Fold of Reality? Did that mean that its history was becoming Earth's history? In that case, would there be changes to the current normal Zones of Earth? Did it mean that Camelot was descending onto Earth? In that case, did that mean that Earth was gaining new citizens? Or potentially enemies in the demons?\nLeonel couldn't make heads or tails of what was happening. He couldn't wrap his mind around just how a fairytale could become a part of real life.\nBut, now that he thought about it, hadn't he been interacting with them all this time? How were the people of Camelot any different from real people? If Leonel had to differentiate them between the people of Earth… he really had no ability to do so.\nAs though this wasn't already confusing enough, Leonel had no idea how he had passed the hidden quest requirements. He had done nothing to this point to work toward that goal. In fact, if he thought about it, he was really stupid for having not at least questioned the dictionary about it first. It was just that he was distracted by learning this new magic system and all the drama that had come with it.\nLeonel shook his head, completely ignoring Modred for the time being.\n\"What requirements did I meet to cause this?\"\nMore than anything else, he was the most curious about this. Actually, it might have very well been possible that he wasn't the one who met the requirements at all. After all, there was still Monet, Violet Rain and Little Nana here. Even though Little Nana had been booted from the trial, she was still one of the Zone participants and Leonel had left her alone for a long while already…\n[*Ping*]\n[Replying to Seed, there are two requirements that need to be met: Awareness and Acceptance]\nLeonel felt as though he had been struck by a bolt of lightning.\nThese two requirements seemed simple enough, but the longer he thought about it, the more impossible they seemed to be to fulfill.\nAwareness alone seemed easy enough. Just telling Modred that a world like his existed might be enough to fulfill the requirements of this first prerequisite. But… what about Acceptance?\nHow could you possibly get someone who was born and raised in Camelot to both be aware that there were other worlds and accept their existence? In truth, even if someone wanted to accept this, it might not necessarily be possible.\nThe only person in this world one couldn't fool was oneself. It was not possible to make oneself think something one didn't want to think or feel a way one didn't want to feel.\nLet's say, for instance, that Leonel was told that a Metamorphosis was coming before it descended. Let's say he was also told that he and everyone else who managed to survive would gain amazing powers beyond imagination. And, let's say that it was his father who told him all of these things and warned him to prepare or else it might cost him his life.\nLeonel might want to believe these words. After all, they came from his father. If he couldn't trust the man he trusted the most in this whole world, then who the hell would he trust?\nBut even if he wanted to believe… could he?\nAt that time, Leonel would have known nothing of the world but what was right in front of him. On top of that, he would have been raised in an environment where science and research was above all else. How could he so easily throw all of these things to the back of his mind to accept what sounded like a nut-case's rantings?\nThis was what it meant to gain Acceptance. Modred not only needed to be Aware another world might exist, but she also needed to Accept to her very soul that it did.\nAfter coming to this understanding, Leonel couldn't help but chuckle. This fourth trial might have been exceptionally cruel, but it actually did him a massive favor. If it wasn't for living Leonel's life from start to finish, how could Modred so easily accept the truth?\nLeonel took a deep breath and calmed himself, looking up to see Modred's playful gaze.\nThe Trial's rumbling continued and seemed to only intensify with each passing moment. It left Leonel feeling disoriented and a bit dizzy. This seemed to remind him that there was much more he had no idea about.\n\"How is the integration happening?\"\n[*Ping*]\n[Camelot will form its own satellite and orbit around the core of Earth's Fold of Reality]\nLeonel raised his brow. He knew that 'satellite' was a technical term astronomers used. It described both artificial and celestial bodies that orbited a planet. Did that mean that Earth was getting another moon?\nWhat did this mean for Earth? What would it do to the already volatile political climate? How would The Empire react? What about those hidden families? The Slayer Legion?\nLeonel felt a massive headache coming on.\nBut something felt off about this continuous rumbling. Leonel subconsciously felt as though something was hindering Camelot's progression.\n\"How long will this take? And does this mean the Zone trial is over?\" Leonel asked.\nModred blinked her pretty eyes. Zone trial? She seemed to be very curious about this. What did it mean exactly? This little toy also seemed to be quite interesting.\n[*Ping*]\n[…]\nLeonel was stunned. The dictionary wasn't answering? This was the first time this had happened. What did this mean?\nJust when Leonel wanted to ask again, the rumbling reached a peak.\nLeonel's vision blurred and swam. He felt his entire body being forcefully ejected. It felt as though his body had been sucked into a blackhole, stretching into a thin line that was pulled out of his current reality.\nBANG!\nLeonel crashed onto something hard, but his vision was still too black to see anything.\nHowever, what he did see when his vision cleared left him stunned.",

There seemed to be no vegetation anywhere around except for some sporadic weeds that seemed painted with an ink black.\nThis place was actually the no-man's land between Camelot and the Demon Empire.\nLeonel's first reaction was as expected. How could he not be infuriated? He had been that close to being able to afford to comprehend the complete Four Seasons Realm. Even if it was someone else's comprehension, the benefit to his strength would have by no means been small. Yet, now that he had been ejected from the trial, it was all over.\nHowever, Leonel didn't have the luxury to dwell on this because what he saw next took up all the head space he had. He felt like his breath had been completely sucked away.\nWas this what the apocalypse looked like?\nRight where the entrance to the Trials had been there was a massive sink hole. It seemed to extend to infinity, having unfathomable depths.\nIf this was all there was, it would be enough to panic. Yet, the sink hole seemed to be connected to the skies by an invisible pillar of energy.\nThe rumbling, black clouds above formed a large eye of the storm above, swirling and forming a massive cyclone. The sight of large masses of cumulonimbus clouds moving along with flickering lightning and heavily falling rain made it feel as though each clap of thunder was crashing against one's heart.\nThis alone would have been enough of a shocking scene to put anyone in awe. However, when Leonel activated his Internal Sight to its fullest degree, he realized that this place that looked as though a mighty god had struck down with his spear from above wasn't so simple at all.\nHe could sense endless fragments of countless laws. Each of them formed whole or partial Force Arts representing a different strength. It was so faint that most of it was invisible even to those who had already awakened their Internal Strength.\nLeonel took a deep breath and closed his eyes. When they snapped open once again, the faint image of a majestic bird loomed over his shoulder. No, it was less accurate to say that it was a bird, but rather a bird's gaze.\nTwo pairs of wisdom filled eyes hung above Leonel while the faint outline of its avian body was hardly detectable.\nThe instant Leonel activated his Wisdom Branch Lineage Factor in full force, the world before him seemed to explode into one filled with stars and flashing lights. Those vague outline of Force Arts were all reflected in his mind, flickering with a beautiful mystery.\nLeonel had never used the Wisdom Branch of his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor like this. There was never a need to, using it passively was enough. But, he had never expected that there would actually come a day that he would need it. Or rather, he hadn't expected that day to come so soon.\n'There's a chance!'\nLeonel was certain that these laws were the ones that represented the Merlin Trial Grounds. Together, they were what formed the domain that had kept them trapped for so long. If he found the Arts he needed, it might be possible to reverse engineer the Legendary Skills.\nJust when Leonel was feeling excited, an overwhelming danger suddenly prickled at his nape. In his current state, his senses were impossibly high. He could tell in an instant that he was being targeted even before the strike was in range to be fatal.\nLeonel sprang upward and rolled to the side, making sure to extend the distance between himself and the sinkhole.\nA violent crack of light landed where he had sat, tearing into the ground for several meters before coming to a stop.\nLeonel rolled to his feet, facing the direction he felt the fluctuation of magic coming from. As he did, he allowed the pair of eyes floating to his back to slowly fade away. He had already made the mistake of letting his stamina run out before. Now, it was at the forefront of his mind. Though activating his Wisdom Branch wasn't nearly as taxing, he still chose to be careful.\nIn the distance, King Arthur held onto his sword, his aura blazing. However, he could only hide how shaken he felt. In the instant before those eyes faded, he felt as though he had been pierced through. It felt no different from a blade running through his chest. Just what kind of ability was that?\nWhen Leonel came out of his own world, he realized that he wasn't the only one that had been forcefully ejected from the Trial. He immediately noticed that the numbers had dwindled by half. It was clear that not all the trials ended the same way his and Modred's had…\nThe heavily falling rain rebounded off the bodies of the warriors. After King Arthur's move, no one else did anything. It was as though they were all aware that this was the calm before the storm.\nLeonel wasn't the only one who noticed the oddly floating Force Arts though he was the one who could definitely see them the most clearly.\nEveryone here were the elite of the elites. How could their Internal Sight be normal? They all realized that this was an opportunity.\n'My luck is so bad…'\nLeonel couldn't help but want to shed tears. He had the inside track to completing the Four Seasons Realm thanks to his ridiculous number of slaughter and star points, but now he actually had to fight again for what he had already earned. As though that wasn't enough, he seemed to still be public enemy number one…\nAs though that wasn't bad enough, the Segmented Cube had also fallen a distance away and it was still in its large form. Leonel definitely couldn't leave without it. Not only was that a treasure his father had entrusted to him, but Little Nana was still within.\nIt was then that the situation changed once more.\nThrough the rumbling thunder and heavily falling rain, the sound of cracking glass and falling beads entered the ears of all present. Though it was odd to describe it in this way, this was the image that Leonel immediately formed in his mind.\nWhen he looked up, he found numerous cracks in space. Within these spaces, flickering gems began to make themselves known.\nVery soon, it became obvious that these weren't flickering gems at all. They were treasures. These were the very treasures that had been part of the Special Ticket Store.\nLeonel's expression changed. 'If Camelot is becoming a part of true history… doesn't that mean I can take these treasures out?'\nLeonel swept his gaze over the three dozen or so remaining elites, his heart tightening.. It seemed the situation had become more complicated again.",

      "content": "Leonel took a deep breath.\nThis was no longer the trial grounds. While this meant that he was no longer restricted by cool downs and limited by skills, it also mean that this was the same for everyone else. This made this situation several times more difficult than it had been in the past.\nLeonel believed that if he tried to use his Dreamscape Battle Sense now, the drain on his mind would be even greater without the limitation on the actions his opponent could take. But, for the time being, Leonel couldn't worry about this any longer.\nLeonel's senses reached out once more. Though it seemed like he was paying attention to the opponents before him through the heavy rain, he was actually looking for Legend Skills.\nLeonel realized something very important. Though it was negative that he could no longer guarantee himself the Four Seasons Realm with his bow, that didn't mean it was a net negative.\nWhile he couldn't guarantee anything anymore… his paths had suddenly broadened. With all of these Force Arts floating around, did that mean that he could find the Legend Skills for his spear as well?\nJust as Leonel was about to act, someone else couldn't hold back any longer.\nLeonel locked onto a Demon Lord. Surprisingly, it was the very same Zombie Demon Lord he had met during his first battle in this no-man's land, Coyote.\nLeonel remembered what Lancelot had said about this Demon Lord. Back then, he had been with the Demon Lord Dagon, a skeleton demon with heavy balls chained to his wrists and ankles. According to Lancelot, Dagon was ranked in the high 20's amongst Demon Lords and was even comparable to those in the top 20. Yet, compared to him, Coyote was much more dangerous.\nThe reason was simple… there was simply too little information about him. No one knew his likes, his dislikes, his tendencies… nothing. Maybe even Mordred was in the dark about this.\nCoyote shot forward, his rotting eyes completely placid as though he didn't notice the tense situation they were all in. A foul stench wafted from his body as heavy droplets of acidic rain rebounded off his dead skin.\n'A spear…'\nLeonel took notice of Coyote's weapon immediately. This was most definitely not the weapon Coyote had used during that battle. It seemed that he had been hiding even his main choice of weapon from others. In fact, as far as Leonel remembered, he barely had any impression of Coyote during the Trials.\nHowever, now that Leonel thought about it, he remembered that the only time he ever saw Coyote display any types of emotions was when the latter felt greed after Leonel took out his black-chained spear.\nBack then, Leonel had been paying particular intention to the two Demon Lords in case the interfered in his battle with the minotaur. With his ability to read people, he would never mistake such an emotion.\n'Wait…'\nLeonel's frown deepened. For someone like as cautious and lowkey as Coyote to be making a move now…?\nLeonel's gaze flashed, locking onto a certain direction. When he realized what was happening, his frown couldn't help but deepen.\nCoyote wasn't running in the direction of a Legendary Skill. But, Leonel knew it was impossible for such a man to take such a risk for nothing.\n'… So that's how it is.'\nLeonel finally understood, but he hesitated. He already had so many enemies. If he made one of Coyote too…\nWhile no one had moved after Coyote did, Leonel could guarantee that if he did, several wouldn't stay idle any longer.\nLeonel shook his head, steeling his heart. This hesitation… it wasn't like him.\nLeonel shot forward, his sudden movement catching the attention of all those who had been paying particular attention to him. Still, of those paying attention, Coyote was the most shocked.\nHe had been very cautious since the beginning. Before he made this move, he had deduced that there was a better than 50% likelihood that no one would bother with him and would choose to instead observe from afar.\nAfter all, the situation was still tense. Humans and demons alike had a tendency of letting others test the waters for them. Like this, it would be possible to test for any dangers ahead of time.\nHowever, he could have never expected that Leonel would actually throw all of this to the back of his mind. In fact, not only had Leonel done so, but it seemed as though his target was completely different from Coyote's. Yet, judging by the fact Leonel's gaze hadn't left the zombie Demon Lord from start to finish, Coyote knew that he had been seen through.\nA smirk curled Coyote's lip. 'It seems that I've been seen through. But so what? They must think I'm weak just because I choose to keep a low profile. Who do you think you are to challenge my will?! Your spear is mine.'\nCoyote didn't bother hiding his intentions any longer. With a hard plant of his foot, he deviated his intention direction slightly, shooting toward the empty space between himself and Leonel.\nThose with weak Internal Sight wouldn't be able to see anything but a foggy space. However, it was clear that both Leonel and the zombie Demon Lord had seen something others hadn't.\nLeonel was just 50 meters from his location. The sloshing of the growing mud beneath his feet didn't seem to impact his speed in the slightest. But, it seemed that he had underestimated just how much King Arthur wanted him dead.\n\"[Minor Teleportation].\"\nLeonel knew the spell well. Not only did it take up a large amount of stamina for a usual Magus, but it took half a minute and sometimes even more to cast. It was simply impractical to use during battle unless one was at the level where casting multiple spells in conjunction was possible.\nFor King Arthur to use this spell now only meant one thing: he had begun preparing it long ago and saved it for the expressed purpose of obstructing Leonel.\nNo matter how kind hearted and understanding Leonel was, he couldn't help but feel a flicker of rage from the depths of his heart.\nFrom start to end, it was always this so-called King Arthur obstructing him in every way and fashion. Did this King really think that he was a pushover? Did he look like a man that could be targeted for death time and time again without consequences?\nLeonel's aura billowed, his bow disappearing in favor of a heavy spear.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nThe sound of the black spear's chains drowned out even the thunder in the sky above. Leonel could feel that his spear had been waiting to be released for a long time. He had repressed it for a long time already, it was finally time to unleash it.\nLeonel's gaze seemed to pierce through the space separating himself and the King.. Even if he couldn't kill this bastard, Leonel didn't mind teaching him a harsh lesson he would never forget. How could he wield that sword so arrogantly without an arm?!",

      "content": "King Arthur widened his stance, grasping his sword with both hands. His blond hair billowed beneath the falling rain. Even in this environment, he seemed completely untouched, a holy golden aura keeping him completely dry.\nLeonel charged forward, his black spear resonating with the clapping thunder. His every step was entirely enveloped by a golden light, accelerating his speed several times over. At the same time, Bronze Runes etched themselves across his body, drawing a crown on his forehead and hovering a halo above his head.\nRaging violet lights emitted from his body, directly suppressing Arthur's kingly might. It felt as though this was the true arrival of a King. A man who could hold his head even higher than the legendary King Arthur.\nSuch a feeling made the rage in Arthur's heart deepen.\nThis brat? Above him? It seemed that since his sword hadn't tasted blood in so long, his legend had been forgotten.\nAt that moment, spear and sword met.\nThe clash caused a violent wind to spread out with them as the center. Sword Force sliced the wind apart to one side and Spear Force billowed into the sky from the other.\nThe land around Leonel and Arthur shook and quaked, their gazes meeting across their weapons.\nLeonel could see the unconcealed rage within Arthur's eyes.\nArthur could see the cold indifference in Leonel's.\nAt that moment, the completely forgot and were uncaring about Coyote. It seemed that the actions of the zombie Demon Lord was meaningless.\nThe five remaining Knights of the Round Table including Gawain watched on, hands on their weapons. There were certain battles they knew they shouldn't interfere in.\nIn the past, these battles were the ones Arthur fought to build his legend. And now, they felt that this battle was no less important.\nSomewhere a long distance away, Queen Guinevere stepped out onto a terrace, looking up toward the rumbling skies. A deep sadness and complexity reflected within her eyes. Somehow, she felt that this battle would be important as well even without being present.\nIt wasn't a matter of winning or losing. It was deeper than that.\nLeonel and Arthur separated, their weapons vibrating wildly.\nArthur's aura surged, Force climbing around his body to impossible heights. It had been too long since the King of Camelot had gone all out. Many had forgotten just how powerful he had once been, it seemed impossible that a child of not even 20 years old could face him.\nBut, the Leonel of now wasn't the Leonel of the past.\nAfter receiving so many rewards, his Force had been crystallized to an elite degree. Even the Lamorak of the past couldn't match him and he was even faintly approaching Arthur's level.\nIf he could already hold his own to a certain extent before… What about now?\n\"[Holy Judgment]!\"\n\"[Holy Judgment].\"\nNot caring for the thoughts of others, Leonel immediately cast the very same spell Arthur had. Today, he would prove a point. This arrogant King… He needed to learn that he couldn't be arrogant just before anyone.\nBrilliant swords formed in the skies, however Leonel's formed several times faster. Before Arthur's spell was even complete, Leonel's golden swords had descended, shattering their Arts to nothing.\n\"[Saintly Light]!\"\n\"[Saintly Light].\" Leonel responded coldly.\nA pillar of light descended toward Arthur before his spell completed, forcing him to dodge out of the way and cancel his own cast.\nThe ground shook and groaned, leaving a pit in the spot he had just once been.\n\"[Sacrificial Cross]!\"\nArthur raised his sword, a blinding light forming at its tip. However, just when he was about to slash downward, a cold voice floated to his ears, tearing at his eardrums.\n\"[Sacrificial Cross].\"\nLeonel's spear slashed downward with a powerful momentum then across with an arrogant burst.\nA cross of blinding golden light shot forward, tearing toward King Arthur. The King brandished his sword, hurriedly blocking, but he couldn't stop himself from sliding backward tens of meters, the web of his fingers tearing apart.\nLeonel brandished his spear, taking a step forward. His hair billowed, seemingly untouched by the heavy rain. His halo hung above his head and his piercing violet eyes peered toward Arthur as though to question him.\nIs this the product of your arrogance? Is this what you were so proud of?\n\"[Light Domain]!\"\n\"[Light Domain].\"\nA sphere of light appeared before Leonel, quickly expanding until it became a dome that shrouded over 20 meters. It completely crushed Arthur's own spell, shattering his sphere before it even expanded outside of his body.\nLeonel held his spear in his right, raising his left.\nHe pointed a finger forward, causing beams of light to form all around him under the influence of [Light Domain]. In this world of darkness, he seemed like the only source of light, willing the Light Element to manifest itself to his beck and call.\nArthur's gaze had turned a furious shade of red. It seemed as though his pupils might drip with blood at any moment. As he brandished his sword, blocking Leonel's furious assault of light, he felt as though something deep within his chest was being chipped away at.\nHe knew he wasn't this weak. Leonel knew he wasn't this weak either. But, his pride wouldn't let him stop casting spells. His pride wouldn't allow him to accept that Leonel was his better in this aspect.\nNo matter what spell he cast, Leonel could do it faster and form it with greater strength.\nLeonel's barrage became faster and faster. Beneath the effect of Light Domain, it was as though a tiger had grown wings. His Light Elemental Arts formed even faster than they had before. He felt as though he could take control of the whole world.\n'Domain…'\nThis was the feeling of a Domain. An absolute control. An undeniable Sovereignty.\nThe spear within Leonel's hand began to shake and rattle wildly. It felt as though it wanted to break free and soar into the skies, looking over all from above.\nA certain enlightenment shook Leonel's heart. For the first time, he felt the call of the spear in his hands.\nAt that very moment, Coyote had appeared before the Legendary Skill Art, his rotting lips curled into a smirk.\nWhat no one expected was for the situation to change once again the instant Coyote grasped the Legendary Skill in his hands.\nThe sound of shattering glass resounded once more, but this was several times louder than when the treasures appeared. It was as though a massive glass statue had fallen from the skies and crashed onto the ground below.\nWithin any explanation, Leonel felt a surging sense of crisis. The primitive man's instincts had already sunk deep into his bones. After being stacked with several other primitive consciousnesses, his instincts had already reached another level, helping his battle sense greatly. In fact, if it wasn't for this, maybe his Dreamscape Battle Sense wouldn't have manifested so easily or so quickly.\nWithout hesitation, he ducked down. As though sensing the same thing, Arthur did the same.\nThose who were lucky followed the crowd even if they didn't sense it themselves. However, those who were unlucky found themselves riddled with holes from an attack they couldn't even see with their own two eyes.\nLeonel watched as several elites fell, dead, not daring to get up on his own just yet. Even three of the Knights of the Round Table fell beneath this inexplicable barrage.\nAt that moment, Leonel's Dreamscape flashed with a violent arc of lightning centering around a particular book… 'The Legend of Affinities: The Epic of Magi'.\nAccording to the book, there were two affinities that were rarer than the Light Element, two affinities that had only appeared within the Legendary Magus of an Era… Merlin.\nThe Time and Space Affinity.\nThat attack, that was most definitely a spatial ripple. However, it wasn't caused by a person. It was caused by the appearance of something.\nLeonel craned his neck from the ground, looking back toward the massive sinkhole he had distanced himself from originally.\nWhen he set his senses forward, a massive Force Art reflected in his mind. It was so large and unfathomable that he felt his mind swim just after glancing at it for but a moment.\nHowever, what was more surprising was that it reminded him of something he had forgotten about.\nMemories flashed within Leonel's mind. He finally remembered.\nHis Healing Branch… He had already awakened it. And the Fourth Dimensional Art hanging within his Dream World… It was the reason he had been able to. Not only was it the reason, but it was eerily similar to the Force Art before him now.\nLeonel's heart palpitated. He knew for a fact that this Force Art was the core that made up Merlin's trial grounds.\nAll this time, the Fourth Dimensional Art within Leonel's world was at 99% complete, but no matter what he did, he couldn't seem to get over the edge and reach 100%. Yet, simply glimpsing at that 99% complete Art in a dazed state was enough for him to instantly comprehend his Healing Branch. Just what kind of affect would it have on other things? Just what kind of affect would it have at 100%?!\n1% might sound like a small distance away, but Leonel knew that this final percent was more difficult to complete than even the first 99% as a whole. If he managed to finish it, the effect wouldn't be as small as double or even triple, it might even be tens of folds!\nLeonel realized in that instant that the most valuable thing here wasn't the Legendary Treasures or even the Legendary Skills. It was the Force Art right before him.\nHowever, Leonel didn't seem to be the only one who realized this.. The moment this Art appeared, the eyes of Pope Margrave and the dual sword wielding Peirce -- who had both maintained a low profile to this point -- lit up.",

      "content": "Peirce stood from the mud soaked grounds and took a step forward, brandishing his two long swords.\n\"Stand down!\"\nGawain looked toward Peirce with reddened eyes. They had just lost three Knights of the Round Table. As things stood now, there was only Gawain and Ector remaining. It could be said that this was the greatest blow Camelot had taken since its establishment.\nGawain's number one priority was protecting the lives of those that remained. He couldn't allow a moment of hot headedness or greed to ruin the foundation of Camelot.\nThe gaze he looked toward Peirce seemed only a step away from madness. He had too many clashing emotions in his mind.\nOn the one hand, he didn't agree with the way Arthur was doing things. But, on the other, he didn't want to see his King lose like this nor did he want his fellow brothers to sacrifice themselves one after another.\nIn the height of his emotions, Gawain believed that Peirce was trying to step in to defend Arthur's honor. Everything he knew about Peirce to this point defined him as a man of honor and nobility. Acting to defend Arthur at this point was exactly what the persona of the past would have done.\nHowever, Gawain would have never expected for a simple command of his to cause Peirce's sword to find its way to his neck.\nGawain might have been in an emotional state, but he was still one of the 12 strongest knights beneath King Arthur. He reacted with an inhuman quickness, arching his back toward the ground and barely dodging the long, slightly curved sword.\nStill, he felt a cold wind across his throat. When he brought his fingers up, he found that a thin line of blood had already been drawn across his adam's apple. Death had been just that close.\nWhen Gawain got over his shock, he immediately felt a surging anger.\n\"Peirce! What do you mean by this?!\"\nGawain's roar seemed to be trying to rival the rumbling clouds above, but it was, maybe fittingly, completely drowned out.\nPPCCHUU!\nBefore Peirce even got a chance to respond, Gawain suddenly felt a sharp pain to his back.\nHe looked down, shaken. His body trembled, blood leaking from his lips as he tried to speak. But, the spear that had gone through his chest didn't seem apt to allow him to do so.\nGawain struggled to turn his head back, only to be shocked to find his brother in arms, Sir Ector.\nShock, unwillingness, resentment… It all flashed through Gawain's eyes in those last moments. But, all he saw in Ector's eyes was a dullness as though he didn't care about taking the life of his friend of so many years.\nGawain's body fell limp and lifeless, the plop of his figure onto the wet ground somehow resounding more than his final roar.\nThe eerie sound seemed to wake Ector from his daze. He blinked, his eyes squinting in confusion. He looked from his bloodied spear to the body on the ground. When he thought of a certain possibility, his heart shook.\n\"ALIARD!\"\nEctor's tragic cry sounded like a wounded beast. He was so furious that the blood vessels of his eyes popped, causing streaking tears of blood to coat his cheeks. However, they were quickly washed away by the heavily falling rain as though the world itself didn't want him to grieve.\nEctor turned his gaze toward an unassuming Magus, a seemingly amiable old man Leonel knew well. If it wasn't for Aliard, Leonel wouldn't have lost control of his emotions during his first meeting with Lamorak and maybe their relationship wouldn't have turned out as tragically as it did.\nPCHU!\nA spurt of blood flew of Ector's neck, his head snapping backward as small bits of remaining flesh tried to keep it attached to his shoulders.\nIn his death, he didn't get to see who did it. However, there had only been one person in that direction. It could only have been Peirce.\nEctor could have never believed that he would be betrayed by not one, but two people of Camelot.\nThis entire sequence of events was witnessed by both Leonel and King Arthur. The latter had reached such a state of rage that his visage had returned to an eerie calm. It was a kind of calm that even made Leonel's heart tremble.\nWhat kind of feeling was it to watch six of your brothers killed one after another? Not only killed, but to even be betrayed by two you once thought you could trust with your life?\nThere were many times that Arthur had thought of expanding the Knights of the Round Table to 13 just to add Peirce. Magus Aliard was a pillar of Camelot, one of the 7 more powerful mages of their Kingdom. Yet, both of them had slighted him in this way.\nAt this point, his rage toward the two of them was several levels beyond the rage he felt for Leonel.\nLeonel cautiously rose, his eyes narrowing as he looked toward Aliard.\n\"So that's how things are… Maybe even Lamorak was being unknowingly influenced…\"\nThere were many people Leonel thought that might be traitorous. He knew there was a high likelihood of a Mythological Zone becoming a Unique Zone, so he had always been paying attention.\nHe subconsciously focused on Lamorak because the latter had not only humiliated him, but always seemed to be outrageously antagonistic for little to no reason. Then, after he saw Mordred's backstory, he realized that the Pope might very well be involved as well.\nBut he had forgotten one thing… Aliard had been there that day too… And, he was a Mage that specialized in mental attacks.\nWhat if from beginning to end, this was all orchestrated by Aliard?\nLeonel's eyes fell on the seemingly amiable, scholarly man. His aura wasn't as towering as King Arthur's, yet the wind and rain seemed to bend around him as though not wanting to disturb him.\n\"You're very curious.\" Aliard spoke. Despite the billowing winds, heavy rain and rumbling clouds, not to mention the hundreds of meters that separated them, Leonel felt as though he was speaking right into his ear. \"You've been branded by The Bishop. Why are you not following his orders properly?\"\nLeonel's pupils constricted.",

      "content": "The Bishop. It had been too long since Leonel heard mention of this person.\nWithin the Joan Zone, this entity seemed to rule the lives of Joan and the men around her. At first, Leonel had thought that The Bishop was the man in the tunnels, Nicolas.\nLeonel still remembered the fanaticism in Nicolas' gaze when he asked him if he was well known in the future. Despite the fact the man was his enemy, Leonel couldn't help but feel bad for him at the time.\nThese people were likely promised great things, but how many of them really got to enjoy these rewards? Nicolas thought he had become some famous legend in the future, yet… Leonel had never heard of him. Wasn't that too sick of a joke?\nThe moment Leonel heard Aliard's words, he realized that this really was related to the matters of the Joan Zone. In all likelihood, his previous conjecture that their purpose in the Joan Zone was related to their successful entry into this Mythological Zone was most likely also correct.\nBut, what made Leonel more apprehensive was that Aliard said he had been branded. Was he talking about the Force Art he had drawn on the back of his left hand? But hadn't he gotten rid of it? How was it that Aliard still thought he was branded?\nThe moment Leonel returned to Earth's Pseudo Fourth Dimension, the Art's effects were shattered. Could it be that Aliard had sensed its previous influence?\nLeonel looked toward the back of his left hand. He could still see the vague outline of the once prominent scar, but the magic it once held had long since disappeared.\nLeonel looked back up, facing Aliard.\n\"So you're the one who made Lamorak target me?\" He asked coldly.\nAliard didn't respond, he seemed to feel that this conversation was meaningless.\nLeonel's gaze narrowed. It seemed that he had been a puppet on a string from the very beginning. Whether it was his battle with Lamorak, his terrible reaction back then, even down to the fact Aliard's 'disciple' Elys had been the one following him and guiding him all this time, it might even be possible that Aliard was slowly manipulating things in the background to make more and more people turn their blades toward Leonel within the trial grounds.\nThe more Leonel thought about it, the more he felt his heart chill.\nHe closed his eyes, settling the rolling waves in his chest. When he opened them once again, his calm had returned.\n\"Thanks, you've taught me a lot.\" Leonel said placidly.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nLeonel brandished his spear, the clanging of the spears reaching a feverish pitch.\nLeonel flipped his palm, causing a horn to appear in his hand. If one looked closely and had been there that day, it would be possible to recognize this horn as having once been the property of the Black Rhino Leonel had defeated during his trip to this no-man's land. Back then, Leonel had just wanted to complete a few missions so that he could read the rest of what the Mage Academy library had to offer. But now, this horn had become his trump card.\nSince these traitors had revealed themselves so easily, even after seeing the combat prowess of Leonel and Arthur, and even taking into account the existence of Mordred and the others, it meant they were confident in their own strength. Confident to the point of believing they no longer had to hide themselves.\nHowever, did he really look like someone who could just be rolled over?\nLeonel guessed that the goal of these people and The Bishop was the Fourth Dimensional Force Art to his back. Maybe in the meantime, they wouldn't mind picking up some treasures and comprehending some Legendary Skills along the way. To them, this was practically an open treasure trove they could take up whenever they wanted. The so-called resistance before them was meaningless.\nLeonel laughed. But, when others heard it, they felt their hearts tremble.\nThey could hear all of his emotions. His bitterness, his rage, his pride.\nIn the past several months, he had been toyed with like a puppet on a string. He thought himself to be intelligent, yet he hadn't even realized who his true enemy was until the last moments.\nNow that he thought about it, Aliard was probably only dissatisfied with him because he wanted to make use of Lamorak for a bit longer. By Aliard's estimation, had Leonel not killed Lamorak and gone against the wishes of The Bishop, Aliard would have never been exposed at all.\nAfter all, his suggestive magic on Lamorak had been weaved over several months to years. It was much too subtle compared to Ector who he rashly took control of just for a few moments.\nThough he didn't mind being exposed now, he felt as though it was unnecessary and he felt forced by the circumstances. He didn't like not having everything in the palm of his hands. To him, Leonel's actions were akin to a jumping monkey stalling the path of a King.\nHowever, even Aliard couldn't help but frown slightly toward Leonel's laughter.\nHe could tell that this laughter wasn't one of hopelessness nor was it one of madness. It was almost like the kind of laugh you gave a friend when you fell for a prank… it was simply too light.\nLeonel brought the horn up to his lips and blew.\nAt first, the horn was a deep black luster. It curled up for over a meter and weighed almost a hundred pounds.\nHowever, after Leonel blew, several gorgeous patterns lit up across its surface, shimmering with a beautiful pale green light.\nThe billowing wind from Leonel's blow tore into the skies, causing the thunderous storm to pause for just a moment.\nAliard's pupils constricted. It wasn't just him, but so did Pope Margrave's. As the two most accomplished mages on the battlefield, they realized exactly what just happened. This was definitely beast taming magic, but they had never seen it used in this way.\nLeonel calmly put the horn away as though he hadn't done anything special. In its place, he pulled out a familiar golden rod. Though it no longer held France's flag on one end of it, Leonel would never forget this pole. It was none other than a replica of Joan's weapon.\n\"I didn't get to use this against the monocle wearing bastard. But, that's just fine. I happen to hate you all almost as much.\"\nDid they think that he, Leonel Morales, was someone they could easily deal with whenever they wanted to?\nHe would make Aliard and the other lackies of this so-called Bishop pay a price for their arrogance.. And, the cost he was asking for was nothing less than their lives.",

      "content": "The blaring horn seemed capable of separating even the thick clouds above. Those close to it felt as though they had suddenly been thrust into the center of a storm. Even after the sound traveled tens of kilometers, it refused to dissipate, multiplying over itself and projecting outward for longer and longer distances.\nLeonel stood amidst the rain with an indifferent expression. However, the ground had already begun to rumble. If the world had already felt as though it might end at any time, it was practically on the brink of destruction now.\nAliard's expression had been bordering on smugness just moments ago. But now, it felt as though everything within his body had tightened. He stared daggers toward Leonel, but the latter remained unmoved.\nAt that moment, the first roars came from over the horizon. Massive demonic beasts of all shapes and sizes charged forward as though they had lost their minds, savage expressions being projected from their red eyes.\nIt could be said that Leonel was an absolute expert of every path of magic Camelot had to offer. As long as it was within the Magic Art Tower, it was stored within his Dream World, never to leave. The only reason he never used elements outside of Light and Earth was because it simply wasn't worth it.\nWith his affinity, casting Light or Earth Arts took half the stamina, could be completed in half the time and carried twice the strength. Why would he waste his time casting other arts when this was the case?\nHowever, there were especially rare instances where the paths of other mages were beneficial to him. Whether it was when he used a teleportation Art as a trump card or when he used the sensory blockers of mental mages to form the maze within Camelot's castle, both of these were instances of Leonel taking a step out of his true comfort zone.\nThe use of this horn was yet another instance.\nOriginally, Leonel hadn't had a plan to use Joan's treasure. He originally saved it within his Dreamscape only to test his new Dream Sculpt ability. Back then, Joan's treasure had just been a useful outlet.\nHowever, after he met Simeon again, he realized that this treasure might become very useful when disrupting Simeon's control over his beasts. Unfortunately, Simeon had smartly retreated long before Leonel got a chance to use this trump card he had kept in reserve.\nWhen Leonel came to this SS-grade Zone, he found himself pushed into a corner again and again. He realized that he needed trump cards or else this really might be the place he died. The problem was that alone… Joan's staff was useless.\nLeonel didn't dare to use it on humans for fear of the backlash. He affirmed this unwillingness after reaching this world. With the strong mental strength of mages, who would dare casually try to take control of their minds? Even Aliard had to be especially careful.\nDue to this realization, Leonel thought that Joan's staff might very well become useless to him until he met Simeon again. But, when he was browsing the Mage Arts of the Magic Art Tower, he suddenly stumbled into the world of beast mages.\nOverall, they were a small profession, often overlooked entirely. Many of them were just glorified mailmen, used to take control of messaging birds to communicate between long distances. However, it was in them Leonel saw endless potential and a plan began to form in his mind.\nThe horn just happened to be a useful medium, but the true strength of the horn were the spells Leonel inscribed onto it. These spells were to beasts what mermaids were to sailors. The moment they heard it, they couldn't help but be lured to Leonel uncontrollably.\nLeonel had been saving this card in his back pocket for a long time, waiting for an opportune moment to use it. In fact, looking toward Leonel now, King Arthur felt an endless bubbling fear within his heart.\nWhat if Leonel had blown this horn from within the walls of Camelot? What would the result have been then?\nThis was maybe the first time King Arthur had ever felt such a way. If Leonel had wanted to raze Camelot to the ground… could he really have done it?\nThere was one point that made all of this all the more shocking.\nIn order to stall Camelot and force them to keep some warriors back to defend their lands, Mordred had commanded beast tides to attack human settlements. Of course, she couldn't control these beasts, she could only direct them in particular directions almost like a glorified herder.\nHowever, due to Mordred's actions, not only were there higher concentrations of beasts in this region than there was usually, they were also in large groups.\nCould it be that Leonel had taken this into account as well? Just who was this boy?!\nLeonel raised his golden road. A powerful, surging Spirit Pressure shot into the skies, separating into dozens of thin lines of energy.\n\"Arthur, Mordred, come here.\"\nArthur frowned. His initial instinct was to reject Leonel's words. But, what the latter said next made his blood freeze.\n\"Come here, or the first person I trample will be you.\"\nLeonel's voice turned completely icy, carrying an air of majesty that seemed to project directly from the halo above his head.\nIf it wasn't about his own life, he would let Arthur be trampled to death. As for saving Mordred, that was for two reasons. For one, he still felt a hint of sympathy toward this beauty. But, more importantly, she was the key to fixing her father's marriage.\nMordred's lashes blinked somewhat flirtatiously. Her tastes were usually quite young to begin with as she had once told Monet. In fact, she had never even considered being with a man, nor was she attracted to them. But, she had quite a good impression of this child.\nEven within the rain, she glided forward elegantly, completely ignoring Arthur as though he didn't exist.\nAt this point, the battlefield was caught in an odd stalemate.\nUnfortunately, the first of the beasts had already crossed into their fields of vision.",

      "content": "Aliard and those with him wanted to charge toward Leonel, but they were hesitant to do so. Though they had previously looked down on Leonel, this didn't mean that they thought they could defeat Leonel in a few exchanges. They knew that they would have to at least put forward a small effort.\nThe root cause of their confidence was their larger number of quality experts. Whether it was Peirce, Margrave or Aliard, they could all battle King Arthur and had better than 50% odds in defeating him. This was without even counting any other trump cards they may or may not have.\nHowever, if they charged for Leonel now, they would become embroiled in battle. By then, the beast tide would definitely be upon them. They weren't na?ve enough to believe that Leonel would summon these beasts without the ability to control them and they could see that it was most likely related to the golden rod in his hands.\nAt that point, they would have to battle not only Leonel, but an endless swarm of beasts.\nCould it be that they would really fall just like this?\nAliard stood opposing the growing group by Leonel's side. Just moments ago, one could have never expected to see such a sight. Not only were there humans by Leonel's side, but even the #1 Demon Lord, Crakos and a few others of his side had converged.\nThese demons had fully expected Leonel to reject them, yet he said nothing.\nWhen the beast tide reached them, the immediate area around Leonel became a safe haven. As though the land around them was sacred to the point even mindless beasts didn't dare to step on it, the swarm took a curved path around them charging toward the group of three men.\nPope Margrave, Peirce and Aliard stood in an inverted triangle position, protecting Aliard to their backs. Solemn expressions coated each one of their faces.\nIndividually, these beasts were nothing to them. But when they came in swarms like this, just how long would they be able to last?\nBut they had to. Their goal had been planned out for too long. If they failed here, the consequences would be unimaginable. They couldn't afford to bear them.\nPeirce twin blades were like twin scythes, leaving blurred images beneath the rain as trails of crimson blood followed their every movement.\nPope Margrave held his cross to his chest, chanting solemnly with his eyes fluttering close. A barrier of light enveloped Peirce and Aliard, replenishing their stamina with each passing moment.\nAliard himself had several veins popping across his forehead. Every time a surge of Spirit Pressure came from him, another beast seemed to be ripped from Leonel's control, crashing into the others and starting a battle to the death.\nLeonel watched all of this with a pair of cold eyes. He didn't care about Aliard wresting control from him. In fact, Leonel hardly resisted against it. Without a medium like the golden staff, it took Aliard far more effort and stamina to succeed. Leonel was happy to let him do it, it only meant that this battle would end all the more quickly.\nHe knew well that the three were holding on hoping that his stamina would run out first. But… was there such a good thing in the world? Unless he was pushed to dire straits, Leonel would never make the mistake of running out of stamina again.\n…\nAs the battle of Camelot was raging, Leonel didn't have the mind to care for two things.\nFirst, he had yet to figure out just why it was the dictionary hadn't answered his question and secondly… the Integration was still ongoing.\nAt this time, Earth was undergoing drastic changes.\nThe Moon was easily taken for granted. However, the truth was that it was responsible for some of the most important constants of Earth. It could influence the atmosphere, the tides and even Earth's tilt and rotation. A slight change to any of these things could throw Earth into a heat wave or another ice age.\nIf this was true… what would happen if a second moon suddenly began to form? What would happen to Earth's rotation? Its atmosphere? Its tilt? Its climate?\nThis was exactly what was happening now. Camelot hadn't even fully formed yet, but the chaos had already begun to shift.\nThe first and most obvious change were the tides. On some coasts, it completely receded. On others, it surged, and began to roll over, forming massive tsunamis that reached into the skies.\nThe climate began to flip and wildly fluctuate causing massive currents of hot and cold winds to form through the atmosphere. The clashing of these changes soon formed major sights of tornados and hurricanes.\nIf one looked toward Earth from space, one would usually find a beautiful blue and green planet that looked somewhat like a polished marble. However, if one looked now, it was almost impossible to see any land at all. Massive white clouds formed large swirling patterns across the skies, masking the disasters they were causing below them.\nSuch massive changes to climate should have occurred over centuries, millennia, even. Yet, in this new world order, it all seemed to be happening simultaneously.\nAt this point, everyone had been focused on clearing out as many Invalids and Zones as possible, all so that a normal society could be rebuilt. But, this sudden change caught everyone off guard.\nAt that moment, Emperor Fawkes stood within Earth's central palace. His hands were clasped behind his back, his flowing white hair whipping about in the surging winds as the sky darkened.\nHis eyes narrowed. He seemed to realize that a massive change was coming even sooner than he anticipated. But, he wasn't sure of what this could mean for the future of Earth. They weren't ready for such a change just yet…\n…\nWithin Camelot's world, Leonel had no idea what was happening to Earth at this moment. However, even if he did, there was nothing he could do about it. He had to stay focused on the task at hand.\nThough he had forced his enemies into a corner and seemingly so easily, at that, he still couldn't feel at ease.\nHe seemed to have earned this victory. He knew that there was a limit to how powerful those of higher Dimensions could send here. With them being restricted in strength, it shouldn't be shocking that they'd lose to a prepared Leonel.\nBut still, Leonel couldn't shake off the feeling no matter how hard he tried. A Unique Zone… shouldn't be this easily resolved.\nAs Leonel was lost in thought, a figure had begun to stealthily move within the group of individuals he was protecting. Leonel didn't seem to react to this change. In fact, even Arthur and Mordred who were both elites among elites didn't sense this change.\nAfter a moment, it became obvious why. Not only was this person exceptionally good at hiding their intentions, but they had been standing near Leonel from start to finish. Yet, even after several moments of this endless attack of beasts, this person had still not made their move.\nAt that instant, Pope Margrave coughed up a mouthful of blood. He had reached his limit. Sustaining the stamina of two elites was too much even for him despite the support of his treasure.\nSeeing this, Leonel slightly relaxed. Maybe he was too anxious. There was no way they could have contingency plans for such an event, right? How many could casually control a tide of hundreds of beasts like this?\nIt was exactly then that the shadow within the group acted. Their actions were so swift that even in the instant they were acting, no one reacted to what was happening.\nThe blade was quick, lethal and merciless. It prayed on the moment Leonel let his guard down like an elite assassin in the night.\nIt charged through the heavy rain, cut through the sharp winds, and aimed for Leonel's back, ready to pierce through his heart. Leonel was finished.\nStill, even then, the shadow didn't relax. As a professional, until Leonel had breathed his last, celebration would never be on their mind.\nPCHU!\nThe blade reached Leonel's back and the shaft of the weapon followed through.\nThe shadow smiled. It was done.\n\"A shame…\"\nThe shadow froze.\n\"… Had you wielded anything but a spear, you might have had a chance…\"\nThe indifferent voice continued to drift into the shadows ears.\n\"… Isn't that right, Coyote?\"",

      "content": "Coyote was stunned. It was only after he registered that this eerie voice he was listening to now was Leonel's that he understood that he had failed.\nHowever, he couldn't wrap his mind around how he had. His spear had very clearly entered Leonel's body even to the middle of its polearm. How could Leonel possible be fine?\nAt that moment, Coyote suddenly felt that something was wrong. Though the shaft of his spear had disappeared, he didn't feel the resistance he should after driving his spear through someone.\n'… My… my spear…'\nCoyote was stunned.\nHis spear, its tip had completely crumbled. In fact, even the portion he hadn't tried to drive into Leonel's body began to break down, crumbling into ash before his very eyes.\nLeonel turned his head back to watch this scene indifferently. It was clear that this was exactly what he expected to happen. To try and use a spear against the owner of the Spear Domain ring was practically asking for death.\nAny spear not acknowledged by the ring on Leonel's finger would crumble beneath its influence. Clearly, Coyote hadn't met these lofty goals so he was destined for failure the moment he stepped forward.\nCoyote couldn't even react before he felt a blade go through his throat. He was simply too close to Leonel and he had suddenly found himself without a weapon. Why would Leonel give him a chance to recover and escape? He had already flipped his palm and swapped out his spear for an arrow.\nCoyote could only die with grievances, having no idea how he had ended up in such a situation.\nArthur and Mordred looked toward Leonel with shock, not understanding what they were seeing either. However, Leonel didn't have the time to mind their reactions. He had already turned his attention back toward Aliard and his companions.\nAs expected, the moment Coyote died, their supposedly dire straits had completely flipped. They stood in the midst of the beast tide, coldly locking eyes with Leonel.\nLeonel couldn't help but shake his head.\n'These people are so cunning and they have no sense of shame. It's as though they put their mission above their pride and dignity. They would rather feign weakness for a chance at easily completing this mission by killing me rather than having an upfront battle.'\nThough it couldn't be said that they were suddenly having an easy time with the beast tide, they were most definitely not on the edge of death as they had made it seem previously. Such a sight made Leonel several points more serious. Just what were they planning now?\n\"Margrave.\" Aliard said coldly.\n\"Yes.\"\nIn that moment, Margrave's aura completely changed. From one of the holiest, sanctimonious light, it became a boundless darkeness, competing even with the vast black clouds in the sky above.\nLeonel wasn't as shocked by this change as compared to others. Thanks to the fourth trial, he had already seen Pope Margrave use Dark Elemental magic. However, even he couldn't expect what would happen next.\nA black pearl appeared in Margrave's hand. He lightly tossed it into the air, causing it to burst apart.\nThis bursting action wasn't an attack, but rather a sort of release, unchaining what was slumbering within. And, when Leonel saw exactly what had been within the pearl, he couldn't help but suck in a cold breath.\nThere were five individuals in total. All of them had the dull white eyes of Invalids, but Leonel knew that they hadn't always been like this because he recognized each and every one of them.\nThey were the members of the Aliard family, Little Nana's family!\nLeonel's expression changed. If this was the case?\nHis head snapped toward the Segmented Cube in the distance. From the start, Leonel had veered the battle away from it in order to protect Little Nana. However, if Little Nana's family was being treated like this, the possibility for what could have happened to Little Nana was endless.\n\"Come here!\"\nLeonel panicked slightly, but he called out as a last resort. He had never tried to command the Segmented Cube before, but he knew that it was a treasure that had to have its own intelligence even if it was somewhat dormant now. If that wasn't the case, how had it acted on its own to take the octopus corpse before? Or what about when it acted on its own to take the corpse of the naked sniper he crossed paths with after leaving the Fort?\nAliard's gaze flashed seeing Leonel's panic.\n\"Do it.\" He said calmly.\nBefore, Aliard had been apprehensive. He didn't know what kind of treasure the Segmented Cube was so he had no idea what might happen if he tried to execute his contingency plan with it acting as a barrier. However, Leonel's panic seemed to put him at ease.\nMargrave acted on Aliard's orders almost immediately, sinking into the ground like a shadow. When he reappeared, he had already left the scope of the beast tide, standing before the Segmented Cube.\nLeonel's panic grew. The Segmented Cube actually didn't listen to his command.\nCould it be that he was wrong about it having intelligence? Could it be that it couldn't hear him? Was there another reason?\nLeonel's mind spun.\nHe didn't believe for a moment that the Pope hadn't done anything to Little Nana. Judging by the methods of these people, they wouldn't go easy on her just because she was young. After all, even the two year old Mordred hadn't been spared. The only reason why Leonel could trust having Mordred by his side was because he had been there for every one of her so-called 'treatments'.\nLeonel's mind spun as he forced himself to calm down.\n'Think… think…!'\nThe defenses of the Segmented Cube weren't infallible. Leonel knew this truth first hand. Back when he awakened his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, he managed to blast a hole right through it. He didn't believe that it could protect itself against an assault from Margrave.\nMargrave gathered his strength, the darkness around him surging endlessly. Leonel diverted a portion of the beast tide toward him, but he already knew it would be too late to make it.\nLeonel's gaze suddenly trembled.\n\"Place any lifeforms into Suspended Animation!\" His roar shot across the battlefield.\nAt that moment, the Segmented Cube finally reacted.\nIt spun in place, suddenly shrinking and dodging Margrave's palm. It then shot across the battlefield at an almost impossible to track speed, reaching Leonel in the blink of an eye.\nIt was only after the Segmented Cube landed in Leonel's hand that he finally sighed a breath of relief. However, in the next instant, he felt a surge of anger.\nThese people were really damnable. Not even letting a little girl go.\nLeonel didn't know Little Nana well, but she had already saved his life once. If for nothing other than this favor, he wouldn't let anything happen to her.\nBeneath his rage, his aura seemed to surge, his violet eyes gaining a slight touch of red.\nAliard slightly frowned at the failure, but it was only that.\nLooking toward Leonel's rage, he couldn't help but sneer. This boy dared to have such an expression before him?!\nAliard stretched out a hand. He had already decided. He would crush this boy with absolute strength and wipe that arrogance between his brow away.\nIt seemed that they had taken his will to end this as easily as possible as a sign of weakness. They would pay dearly for this.\nHis hand continued to raise.\nAt that moment, most of the beast tide was blocked by the five Aliard family puppets Margrave had taken out. But, what Aliard did next would make them nearly obsolete.\n\"Bind.\" He spoke coldly.\nIt was then that it happened. Dozens of beasts were grinded to a halt beneath the might of a single word.\nLeonel's eyes widened.\nThat ability.. It was Little Nana's.",

      "content": "Leonel's gaze went completely red.\nWithin the Joan Zone, he had already seen those like Pierre and Nicolas gaining abilities through Force Arts. They drew these Arts directly onto their bodies, gaining power through their pain and sacrifice.\nHowever, what Leonel had always understood was that these abilities had to come from someone. He didn't know who they came from, but he knew that this was the only way things made sense.\nRemembering Little Nana's fear when Margrave asked her to come to him, Leonel's fists clenched so tightly that veins threatened to burst along his forearm. Maybe if it wasn't for his impossibly strong physique, that's exactly what would have happened.\nHow exactly had they extracted Little Nana's ability from her? What had they put her through?\nIf the pain for just receiving the ability was so great, what was the pain like for snatching an ability?\nWas Little Nana already under their control? Leonel couldn't imagine any other reason they would allow her to roam so freely.\nThe more he thought about it, the more furious he became.\nThe first person that Leonel had ever wanted to kill was the Junior Governor Duke. That bastard shot canons at his own citizens – men, women and children who relied on him for protection. Such scum deserved no less than the worse of deaths.\nLeonel had never expected that his desire to kill would be unleashed again so soon.\nAs though something constrained within his body was completely released, the muddied ground beneath his feet quaked, sinking in beneath his might.\nWithout a thought for anything else, he placed the Segmented Cube within his spatial ring and shot forward.\nWatching his back, Arthur and Mordred looked toward the valiant young man. The halo above his head, the violet-bronze aura swirling around his body, his dauntless charge…\nThe father-daughter pair looked toward one another. A swirl of complex emotions lit Arthur's eyes, but to Mordred it was as though she was looking toward just any other person.\nMordred smiled somewhat playfully, but it was most definitely not the kind of look one gave to their own father.\n\"I'm going to support him.\"\nWithout another word, she too shot forward.\nArthur looked down at his sword then toward the corpses of his comrades. He sighed a sigh that seemed to resonate from the depths of his heart. Rain finally fell onto his body, pelting across his valiant white armor and drenching his golden hair.\nMaybe it was only at that moment he decided to come back to earth…\nThen, he too charged.\nThose who had remained in Leonel's circle of protection looked toward each other. They were just an odd mix of humans and demons. The most powerful among them was probably the #1 Demon Lord Crakos.\nThey were unsure if they should act as well, but there was truly no choice in the matter. They weren't fools. They felt that if they lost this battle, they would regret it for a lifetime.\nLeonel didn't pay attention to who was coming with him. Maybe it was that he didn't care or maybe this was the charisma of a King.\nWhen a General led a vanguard, did he need to look to his back to ensure his Knights were following? When a King entered a room did he need to check to make sure everyone had bowed? When an Emperor looked over a world, did he need make all understand his sovereignty?\nLeonel didn't need to look.\nWith a flip of his palm, the arrow vanished, being replaced by his black spear.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nThe sounds seemed to resound even more now than they had in the past. It was as though it could feel Leonel's emotions, his valiance, his Kingly aura.\nLeonel appeared before the five Aliard family puppets. But, before he could act, he heard a giggle by his ear.\n\"I'll take them on, little one.\"\nLeonel didn't look back. His steps suddenly became unpredictable and erratic.\nSilver Skill 'Abrupt Stop'. Silver Skill 'Explosive First Step'. Gold Skill 'Irregular Steps'.\nLeonel brushed by the five as though they weren't there at all.\nIn that instant, Peirce appeared before him, his two long swords blurring into long shadows beneath the falling rain.\n\"Leave him to me.\"\nAnother voice trailed behind Leonel carrying a fury no less than his own.\nPeirce's betrayal was like a knife to King Arthur's heart. He felt like everything he had built as a King was crumbling before him. All the sacrifices he had made, all the tears he had shed, all the blood he had spilt… None of it seemed to matter anymore.\nHe had lost six of his brothers. He had long since lost his daughter. His wife was hardly his own. And now, his Kingdom was crumbling before his eyes.\nWhat did he have left?\nKing Arthur roared beneath the rain. It drenched him from head to toe.\nHe poured his everything into his strike. If he couldn't strike Peirce down today, he would never be able to take a first step.\nLeonel used Arthur to surge past Peirce, his eyes training on Aliard.\nHe entered the range of the mental mage, his mind having returned to a state of eerie calm.\nThis was the man who had caused him so much trouble from the very beginning. He was the one who set Lamorak against him. He was the one who caused the death of so many innocents. He was the one who treated the life of a little girl as though she was just expendable cattle.\nAliard's lip curled. \"You're courting death.\"\nHe raised his hand again.\n\"Bind.\"\nLeonel felt formless shackles cover his body. He could tell that these restrictions were many times more powerful than when Nana used them. It might have been because she was still too young, maybe it was because she still had too little understanding of her own ability, or maybe it was because Aliard's abilities as a mental mage stacked well with Nana's ability.\nWhatever the truth was, anyone would feel as though it was impossible to break these shackles. Despite controlling a tied of beasts, Aliard still had plenty of stamina left to deal with Leonel.\n\"Die.\"\nLeonel's gaze remained expressionless, his eyes boring holes in Aliard.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nThe sounds of the chains became more furious.\nBeneath a King's Domain, you dare to be so disrespectful?!\nThe words seemed to boom through Aliard's mind.\nAt that moment, Leonel finally heard the spear's name. In that instant, he had finally grasped a portion of his first Spear Domain.\n\"Chain Domain.\"\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nA dome of black light expanded around Leonel. Across its surface, illusory chains whipped about like vines and whips, resonating with the rumbling thunder above.\nThe binding restrictions Aliard placed down suddenly found themselves being ironically restricted. In the blink of an eye, they weakened by more than half.\nWith a flex of his body, Leonel shattered them, landing on the ground.\nHis hair billowed wildly as he stepped toward Aliard, a halo of violet-bronze hanging above his head.\nAliard's calm expression finally cracked. But to Leonel, his reaction didn't mean a thing.\nHe had come to kill.",

      "content": "Leonel's momentum was stifling. It felt as though the whole world was bowing down to him, as though everything within his reach was his own Domain.\n\"Domain?!\"\nAliard was so shocked by what he was seeing that he didn't know what to say.\nLeonel was simply too ignorant of the way of this new world order. Often times, he couldn't properly grasp how his own abilities compared to others and just how valuable some of the resources he had available to him were. As such, he had no way of knowing just how rare Domain abilities were or just how powerful they were.\nThe so-called [Light Domain] couldn't truly be considered such an ability. Though it had helped Leonel understand the framework of what a Domain should be, [Light Domain] could only be considered a cheap imitation.\nA Domain, no matter what kind it was, represented Sovereignty, a dominion, an area of absolute control.\nIn order for one to comprehend a Domain, one must be of the King's Path. However, not only did Leonel not know this, he had no idea what a King's Path was to begin with.\nThis couldn't be considered to be Leonel's fault. At Earth's current level, it wasn't worthy of coming into contact with such a thing. In fact, even Fourth Dimensional worlds and most Fifth Dimensional worlds would never come into contact with such a thing. Even if there was a child with such abilities born into such a world, their talents would more than likely go completely unnoticed.\nUnderstanding the King's Path wasn't just about having the ability, it was also about being of high enough standing to learn about it to begin with. And, even then, the so-called King's Path was just the tip of the iceberg.\nWith all of this said, it was thus shocking that Aliard was even aware of the existence of such a thing. And, the truth of the matter was that he wasn't. He had no idea what the King's Path was. The reason his reaction was like this was only because he had a small bit of knowledge about Domains, and this small amount of knowledge was already enough for him to shiver in fear.\nLeonel, however, didn't care about Aliard's reaction. To him, having a Domain wasn't a big deal. This Chain Domain was just one of hundreds of Domains he could comprehend. In fact, it was among the very weakest. With such a perspective, how could Leonel realize the kind of treasure trove he was sitting on?\nAll he cared about was burying Aliard.\nBANG!\nLeonel shot forward.\nAt that moment, Aliard felt as though he was moving through quicksand. He felt a weight on his body that seemed beyond simple gravity. It was as though limiters had been placed on his body, not allowing him to display his full potential.\nAliard forced himself to calm down. Even though this was a mighty Domain, it had its own weaknesses. It was clear that it was still very immature.\nFor one, even though this was a Restriction type Domain, it could only work on the physical body. It had little impact on his Spirit Pressure or the Mage Arts he could cast.\nThe only unfortunate part was the Little Nana's ability only worked on the physical for now as well, which meant that within this Domain, it was impossible to use this ability against Leonel.\nStill, after thinking to this point, Aliard had already calmed down completely. The range of Leonel's Domain was only about ten meters currently. This meant that he couldn't stop Aliard from continuing to bind the beasts. As long as the beasts couldn't interfere, he didn't believe he couldn't deal with an immature brat!\nAt that moment, the ground before Leonel turned into a shadow, quickly manifesting Margrave who had returned to protect Aliard.\nLeonel didn't seem fazed by this, he had already been prepared. It was impossible to expect Mordred to stop both a group of five elites and Margrave at the same time. From the moment Leonel stepped onto this battlefield, he was prepared to face the both of them at once.\nMargrave immediately realized that his physical speed had been limited by Leonel's Chain Domain. However, he reacted quickly, surging with Dark Elemental Force. It was clear in an instant that his strength in the Dark Element far surpassed his skill in the Light Element.\nShadow-like tendrils shot up from the ground, shooting toward Leonel. At the same time, Aliard's eyes flashed, manifesting numerous invisible drills that pierced toward Leonel's mind.\nLeonel charged forward as though he couldn't sense the danger.\nA sinister light flashed within Aliard's eyes. He wasn't surprised by this result. This was the same fool who couldn't even block a simple mental agitation spell just a couple months ago. It was impossible for him to be able to see through the intricacies of mental mage magic already.\nLeonel's spear swept forward, a strong Spear Force and light coating its tip. It slashed apart Margrave's attack as though it was formed of tissue paper, allowing him to close in on the former Pope in the blink of an eye.\nMargrave felt the restrictions coating his body. He couldn't move as he willed, and even if he could, how could he, a lifelong mage, match Leonel's speed?\n\"[Shadow Shield].\"\nNumerous triangular curved shield appeared between Leonel and Margrave. Though Leonel shattered the first two with absolute ease, the third and subsequent fourth slowed his steps greatly. It seemed as though his momentum would come to a grinding halt at that very moment.\nIt was then that Aliard's invisible attack entered Leonel's range.\nIf one could look into the world of a mental mage, it looked as though six cone-shaped drills were spinning toward Leonel, each more sinister than the last. One was even directed right toward Leonel's brainstem, looking to kill him with a single lethal strike.\nThe strike seemed inevitable. Even as Leonel shattered the last of Margrave's defenses and closed in on the man, the latter was relaxed as though he could already see Leonel's corpse.\nHowever, it was at that moment that Leonel's eyes closed and reopened. It seemed like it occurred in but a moment, just a singular split moment. In fact, if the two men didn't know better, they would think that Leonel had simply blinked…\nBut, there was no mistaking the sudden change to the air.\n\"AGH!\"\nAliard held onto his head, shrieking in pain. Even when he closed his eyes in an attempt to escape, he couldn't shake the sight of those two predatory eyes boring into his mind…",

      "content": "Leonel didn't seem to hear Aliard's cry of pain. He had already closed in the distance to Margrave.\n\"[Darkness Do--]!\"\n\"[Light Domain].\"\nLeonel's indifferent voice cut through it all.\nThe original creator of [Light Domain] didn't spend years of research constructing this spell so that it could enhance Light Elemental Arts. Though it worked out this way, it could only be considered a mere afterthought, an unexpected position outcome.\nThe main reason it was created wasn't to boost the light, but to restrain the dark!\nLeonel could tell that the reason Margrave was so good with the Dark Element was because it wasn't a simple affinity. Leonel was certain that manipulation of darkness was Margrave's ability, not much unlike the little mink.\nHowever, even still, [Light Domain] directly suppressed his ability to converge the Dark Element. It was just a small delay. But… in a battle of such intensity, especially when Margrave had already been caught off guard by Leonel's counter attack once… did he really stand another chance?\nAn image of a valiant man with a mane like beard appeared in Leonel's mind.\nHe was a man with an indomitable spear, one that could pierce through all things.\nThe first time Leonel used this man's consciousness in battle, he had been using a wooden spear. But, even then, he deformed a heavily reinforced shield and sent a shieldman flying.\nIt was that will that manifested again. A man with a single spear facing the whole world. Even though it looked like a simple pierce, it felt as though even if there was a mountain before Leonel, he would shatter it.\nPCHU!\nMargrave looked down at his chest with an incredulous expression.\nWhat shocked him wasn't the fact Leonel's spear had gone through him. In fact, it was the fact Leonel's spear hadn't targeted him at all that left him stunned.\nLeonel's spear ran through a seemingly inconspicuous shadow on the ground. Yet, Margrave felt as though his chest had been run through and his life was quickly escaping him.\n\"You… How…\"\nLeonel's gaze carried an undying sharpness. It was as though he had used the universe itself as his whetstone.\n\"How many times do you think the same trick will work on me? How much longer did you plan on feigning weakness? Since you don't seem to take me seriously, just die.\"\nMargrave's mouth spluttered with blood, his face painted with an incredulous expression as he slowly fell over.\n'It seems that… you never fell for it at all, right?'\nMargrave died with grievances. His [Shadow Heart] was one of his greatest trump cards. He had no idea how Leonel had seen through it. But, even worse than that, Leonel had never fallen for his weakness ploy even once, even if one considered Coyote's sneak attack. So… why did he sound like the one who had suffered the loss?\nLeonel pulled his spear from the ground, walking by Margrave's corpse as he slowly approaching Aliard's writhing figure.\nThis time, he didn't allow the eyes of his Snowy Star Owl to fade. If it wasn't for it, he really would have fallen for Margrave's ploy and likely suffered a loss. Seeing how cunning these people were, he no longer dared to lower his guard. For individuals like this, he had every intention of remaining cautious to the very end.\nLeonel stood a meter and a half from the screaming Aliard, leveling out his spear until it hung just before the man's forehead.\n\"The Bishop, who is he?\" Leonel asked coldly.\nAliard continued to writhe in pain as though he couldn't hear Leonel's words.\nIn the distance, the battle between Arthur and Peirce was reaching a climax. But, it was clear that King Arthur's legend wasn't for show. He had gained a slight upper hand and if given enough time, Leonel felt that victory would be his. If Leonel turned back now, the battle would be as good as over.\nAs for Mordred, she was even freer. She had gained support from the other demons and humans early on, giving her the easiest task. In addition, it seemed like Margrave's control over the five members of the Adurna family collapsed.\n\"Chain.\"\nThe moment Leonel's judgment descended, Aliard found himself wrapped in countless illusory chains. It seemed that whatever tricks they had had completely collapsed. This time, Leonel really had been too cautious.\nHe had underestimated the kind of affect his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor could have. If it wasn't because Aliard's comprehension of mental mage arts was so far beyond Leonel, his mind would have been directly shattered.\nLeonel's palm flipped, causing a snowglobe to appear in his hand.\nAliard seemed to finally react to this sudden change. He tried to shift backward, but the chains that bound him made him look no different from a pitifully escaping worm.\nLeonel shot a kick forward, clipping his chin and knocking him out completely. Only after Aliard had been trapped within a state of Suspended Animation did he sigh a breath of relief. He didn't know if he could extract any information out of Aliard, but what he did know was that he couldn't continue to remain in the dark like this.\nLeonel turned back, only to find Mordred and King Arthur dealing a final blow to Peirce.\nA breath he didn't know he had been holding was finally released. Were things really over now?\n'It seems that Nana's family hadn't died, they were just taken control of…'\nLeonel had thought that Margrave was a necromancer, but it seemed like that wasn't the case. Or maybe they had only kept Nana's family alive so that it was easier to control her.\n'If that's true, it's likely that whoever can extract abilities and copy them to others needs their subject to be alive.'\nLeonel made the only conclusion he could with such limited information. It was clear that this Bishop valued Nana's ability even compared to others.\nThis was ultimately a good thing for Leonel. He had so many enemies already, maybe being a friend to a hidden family wouldn't be a bad thing.\nStill, he didn't get ahead of himself. He had seen no lack of ungrateful people in this new world order. Who knew if the Adurna family would appreciate his help?\nA wave of fatigue assaulted Leonel. His nerves really had been stretched too thin for too long.\nHe shook his head, knowing that it still wasn't time for him to rest.\nLeonel slowly trudged toward the sinkhole, focused entirely on the massive spherical Force Art that loomed above it. Even compared to the one within his Dream World, it was massive. No matter how Leonel looked at it, he had no idea how to take advantage of this thing. And, even though he was right before it, he had no idea why it was those Higher Dimensional Beings wanted it so much.\nIt was impossible for Leonel to copy it with his Dream Sculpt ability. Last time, he had relied on the enlightenment given by the maturing Force Core to succeed. Not to mention the fact there was no such boost here, even if there was, with how much more complicated this Art was, there was no guarantee he would succeed before his stamina ran out.\nLeonel sighed. \"What is this? And how do I take advantage of it?\"\nAs usual, Leonel tried to rely on the dictionary. But, his expression changed once again when he didn't get an answer. Was this thing broken? What was happening?\nLeonel frowned. If the dictionary was really broken, this was too big of a loss.\n'Maybe…'\nLeonel's palm flipped over and another snowglobe appeared.\nHe looked from the snowglobe to the sinkhole and spherical Force Art before him.\n'Won't know unless I try…'",

      "content": "Leonel brought the snowglobe forward, hoping to see some sort of tangible change. But, he was quickly disappointed. The large, complex and spherical Force Art didn't budge even a bit.\nLeonel shook his head. He couldn't even look at this Force Art directly without feeling a splitting headache, but now he couldn't even store it away?\nSuddenly thinking of something, Leonel began to search the bodies of Aliard, Margrave and Peirce. There had to be a clue on their bodies about what their plans for this Force Art actually was.\nKing Arthur watched this scene as though he was hesitating to say something.\nA part of him wanted to say that these treasures should be split. If he did say so, he wouldn't necessarily be in the wrong. After all, he did participate in the battle and he did alleviate the pressure Leonel had been feeling. So, compared to some other shameless individuals, he would have more of a right to speak of such things.\nHowever, a part of him wanted to hold back. He didn't know why, but he felt as though saying something like this would be inappropriate.\nLeonel continued to search through their bodies as though nothing was happening. It was only after finding a few spatial treasures that he looked up toward this King that seemed to be just a shell of his former self.\nArthur felt somewhat uncomfortable beneath the gaze of Leonel didn't say anything for a long while. But, Arthur was ultimately a King, his deeply ingrained pride didn't allow him to look away.\nSuddenly, Leonel smiled. \"Your Majesty, did you forget that there are countless treasures floating around? What are you standing around for? Do you want them all to disappear first?\"\nLeonel's words suddenly snapped everyone out of their stupor and absentmindedness.\nDue to the harsh weather and the subsequent battle, everyone had forgotten that the initial spark for everything were the Force Art Skills and the treasures of Merlin's Trials. The dark skies and rushing rain made it too easy to miss the floating treasures in the air, they could hardly see their hands right before their faces.\nArthur was stunned for a moment before he laughed and shook his head.\nInstead of heading toward the treasures as everyone expected, he slowly walked toward the bodies of his fallen brothers and kneeled by their sides falling into silence.\nSometimes actions spoke louder than words. And in this case, Arthur's actions spoke the loudest.\nNo one knew what would happen to Camelot. The weather had only been growing worse and the rumbling of the ground had never stopped. In fact, it was only growing more intense.\nIn such a situation, Arthur was actually still thinking about treasures. Even he found himself to be laughable.\nIt was impossible for a person to change in an instant of time. But, it seemed possible for someone to take a first step.\nArthur placed Peirce's head before his brothers, falling into silence.\nLeonel watched this scene from afar and didn't say much. Mordred's gaze flashed for but a moment before returning to normal. She seemed more interested in Leonel than anyone else.\n\"Everyone.\" Leonel spoke. \"I won't hog everything. You can rely on your own abilities to snatch the treasures that remain. But, since there are so few of you remaining, I hope there won't be anymore killing. The future is still uncertain right now, so do your best to preserve yourselves…\"\nLeonel knew that the integration with Earth's Fold of Reality definitely wouldn't be smooth. Though, this situation was much better than it could have been. Since Camelot was appearing with its own land and resources, it wouldn't be encroaching on Earth, at least not immediately.\nBut, who knew how long that would last?\nAs things stood now, Leonel didn't feel any sort of special attachment to Earth, and he definitely didn't have one for Camelot. He just hoped they wouldn't massacre one another to the last man.\nWith those words said, Leonel turned his attention back to the rings in his hands, completely ignoring the gaze of Monet and Violet Rain. It was no surprise that they both believed that his words were targeted at them, but what could they do about it? Leonel had made his stance clear, and he also made it very obvious that he was the most powerful individual here.\nMonet's gaze narrowed.\n'I stand no chance against him… Unless the Fourth Dimension descends, it'll remain like this…'\nEvery Dimensional Descent would cause an overall evolution of its world and people. Monet felt that even with the strength of her ability, she would need it to evolve again for her to stand a chance against Leonel.\nBut, by then… wouldn't Leonel's ability also evolve?\nThe variables were too many and the future was too difficult to read. Whether or not she would succeed in surpassing Leonel when that time came was still questionable.\nLeonel, however, had no intention of letting those he had already surpassed threaten him in the future.\n'There's nothing in here…'\nLeonel frowned.\nWithin Margrave's spatial ring, the most important thing he found were crystals that held various Dark Elemental spells.\nThis was technically a good thing. Though Leonel had no intention of using them himself, he could use 'Perfect Union' to transfer these skills to the little mink and allow the little guy to slowly gain more control over his own abilities.\nHowever, even if it was good, it wasn't what Leonel wanted to find.\nAliard's ring was even more useless to him. It contained more sinister mental mage spells than what Leonel could find within the Mage Academy, but other than that, there was nothing.\nLeonel's frown deepened because Peirce's ring was even more useless to him. It contained sword techniques and he obviously didn't wield a sword.\nThe truth was that Leonel was less off put by the fact he couldn't find anything than by what the fact he couldn't find anything meant.\nAll of this meant that he once again couldn't see through the purpose of The Bishop and his fanatics.. And this… was a worst-case scenario.",

      "content": "Leonel could only shake his head as he threw Aliard back into a state of suspended animation.\n'There was a mind scouring technique within Aliard's possession…'\nThere were many sinister techniques within Aliard's possession. Among them, there was a technique by the name of [Mind Search]. It was a technique that left the target pretty much brain dead.\nHowever, Leonel didn't dare to use this technique so freely, and especially not against Aliard. The backlash for failing was even worse than being the target of such a technique. Without enough assurance in his own skill, he couldn't.\n'After my Soul Force evolves to use Fourth Dimensional Force, I'll learn the technique and use it on Aliard. Only then would I have 100% assurance.'\nLeonel was satisfied with his choice to remain cautious. However, being cautious now wouldn't help him with the current situation.\nBy now, many of the elites who had remained began to discuss how to split the treasures. It was quite shocking. If others of Camelot knew that Demons and humans were discussing things with their words and not their blades, who knows how they would react?\nLeonel tried the dictionary again, but it still remained silent.\nA sigh escaped his lips.\n'Maybe I should focus on gathering the Legendary Skills. This world doesn't seem like it'll stay in this state for much longer.'\nThough it seemed like everyone was casual, the only reason they weren't running around panicking was because of their elite statuses. They weren't common folk, they knew that no matter what was happening, they needed strength to overcome it.\nIn addition, there was no use in rushing back to Camelot or the Demon Empire. By the time they got there, everything would have likely been set in stone. So, why not stay here and benefit?\n'There's one thing I still haven't tried…' Leonel thought to himself, flipping his palm to reveal the Segmented Cube.\nLeonel had realized something. Whenever the Segmented Cube swallowed something, it would separate into its jigsaw puzzles and envelop it. Then, when Leonel entered, whatever it swallowed would magically be within one of the snowglobes. Who knows, maybe it could help him out now?\n\"Help me out a bit, will you?\" Leonel asked in a somewhat pleading tone.\nThis Force Art was too important him.\nLeonel suspected that this Force Art, the one in his Dream World, and others like it could boost the comprehension speed of whoever wielded it. How else could he had comprehended his Healing Branch in such a perilous moment?\nIf this was true, the benefits would be nearly infinite. He couldn't bring himself to leave it behind even if there were other treasures to be had here.\nThe Segmented Cube suddenly whirred to life, causing Leonel's eyes to widen with expectation.\nIt spun on Leonel's palm for a moment before shooting forward through the rain.\nIt expanded to hundreds of meters in width in the blink of an eye, separating into countless little jigsaw puzzles.\nThe others watched on in shock but didn't say anything. They could tell that there was something frightening above the sinkhole just based on instinct. But, most of them couldn't even see it. And, those who could, could only do so for a moment before their minds were split apart by a blinding headache. Clearly, they weren't qualified to benefit from whatever this thing was.\nWhen the Segmented Cube returned to Leonel's hands, he smiled brightly, a weight finally being taken off of his shoulders. Though his mind was still too weak to comprehend this Force Art now, if he found another opportunity like he did within the Force Crystal Mine, the benefits would be unimaginable.\nFeeling relaxed, Leonel finally turned his attention to other things and began to pick out Legendary Skills.\nLeonel realized during this process that fusing with these skills wasn't so simple. If he wanted to make them his own, he would have to draw them into his Dream World with his Dream Sculpt ability just like he had for the Mage Arts he learned.\nBut, Leonel didn't mind this.\nFor one, thanks to this, he was able to find the spear Legendary Skill he lost to Coyote floating above his body after his death. Clearly, Coyote hadn't managed to make it his own.\nAnd secondly, this meant that compared to others, he had a great advantage. Who knew how many years of meditation it would take the others to comprehend their own Legendary Skills? As for Leonel, he felt that a few weeks, and a couple months at most, would be enough for him to finish Dream Sculpting one. Within a few years, he would have finished with them all.\nStill, this made Leonel realize just how magical Merlin's World was. Somehow, with the use of skill points, star points and slaughter points, he managed to make the process instantaneous.\nThis level of skill was far beyond Leonel's comprehension and something he could only look up to. But, at the same time, Leonel felt like the secret to allowing this was within the Fourth Dimensional Force Art he had used the help of the Segmented Cube to take.\nLeonel managed to find the remaining three Legendary Skills for his bow and the one Ultimate Skill that helped fuse them. Then, he repeated this task for the spear.\nHe originally planned to stop there, but when he found the Ultimate Skill for his spear, he stumbled across the Summer Legendary Skill for fists.\n'There's no one here who relies on fist techniques…'\nRemembering his time with Heckle and the boxing techniques he learned, Leonel smiled and decided to snatch the four Legendary and one Ultimate Skill for fists as well. Who knows, it might come in handy one day.\nLeonel's heart felt light. Though the trip to this Zone had been dangerous, he had benefited a lot.\n'Aina…'\nLeonel looked up toward the rumbling skies. It seemed like the apex of this transformation was coming. With its conclusion, Leonel knew that his Zone quests would end as well.\n\"Leonel.\"\nA sudden voice snapped him out of his thoughts. He turned to see that it was Crakos, the #1 Demon Lord.\n\"Yes?\" Leonel asked.\n\"Choose.\"\nCrakos' words were blunt and without flowery wastes of breath. His voice itself, despite his massive size, actually sounded quite scholarly and soft, though. It was quite an interesting contrast.\nLeonel looked toward what was in Crakos' hands only to find numerous floating treasures, all of which had been trapped within spatial dimensions.\n\"Oh?\" Leonel's gaze lit up. \"I won't stand on ceremony, then.\"\nLeonel smiled and took a familiar necklace. It seemed that the Treading Goddess Necklace would still fall into his hands in the end.\nAt that moment, the feverish rumbling of the world reached a peak.

      "content": "Earth shook and quaked. At that moment, a second moon appeared in the sky. But, compared to the silvery beauty that was the original, this one was bathed in blackness, making it exceptionally difficult to pick out in the night sky.\nThe result was an even more violent change to Earth's climate. It was impossible to tell exactly what would happen and just when these changes would come to an end.\nThat said, these things had little to do with Leonel…\n…\nLeonel's vision blurred. When it finally cleared once more, he found himself in a familiar white space.\nOne would think the first thing Leonel would do would be to rush forward and demand the treasures he had earned. But, instead, he collapsed to the ground, taking deep steady breaths.\nThese past few months had truly been too hard. Even though only a week or so had passed in the real world, to him, it had been over a year. His 19th birthday was also quickly approaching within this true timeline.\nHe looked up toward the endless vastness of white and smiled. He didn't know why he did, but he just felt like he should.\n\"How long are you going to lie there?\"\nLeonel grinned hearing the familiar voice.\n\"Just a bit longer, Uncle Montez.\" Leonel mumbled.\nEventually, Leonel sat up.\nSeeing the boy finally move, Montez wanted to admonish him about the time limit of this place again, but he seemed stunned to see Leonel's current state.\nThe current Leonel looked practically like a beggar. His clothes were torn and caked in blood, mud and rain. It was as though he had spent several years on a battlefield and only just came out. In fact, this wasn't even that far from the truth.\nStill, what shocked Montez even more was Leonel's hair color. Despite the state of the rest of his body, Leonel's hair seemed untouched and unblemished. It didn't even have the slightest speck of dust on it.\nAfter a moment, Montez hid his shock and shook his head.\n\"You look like a mess.\"\nLeonel's grin didn't fade. \"Well, your nephew here suffered quite a lot in the past few months.\"\nMontez laughed. \"I can see that.\"\nWithout another word, Montez took out a scroll and unfurled it. The moment he did, his playful demeanor vanished.\nIn silence, he read the details of the Zone and what Leonel went through. When he finally looked up, he couldn't decide whether this boy had heaven defying good luck or bad luck.\nThe first time he entered a Zone he accidentally cleared a four person Sub-Dimensional Zone on his own. The second time he entered a Zone it nearly became a Unique Zone. And the third time he entered, the worries from the second Zone became reality.\n\"You cleared a Unique Zone?\"\nLeonel shrugged. \"I was a bit lucky.\"\nMontez didn't refute this. Unique Zones weren't a joke. Sometimes, they could be more difficult to clear than Zones several levels above them in difficulty. It could only be said that Leonel was lucky that Earth was still a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional World. If not for this, he would likely be dead.\n\"What did you do with the Adurna family members?\" Montez asked.\nLeonel rubbed his nose. \"They're in a safe place.\"\nMontez looked toward Leonel for a while before bursting out into a fit of laughter.\nHe already understood what Leonel was doing. If he just released the Adurna family, he'd have to split the reward. But, if he kept them within the Suspended Animation state, they would still be considered 'dead' until all of this ended. That way, he'd be able to monopolize more treasures.\nHe didn't feel bad about this at all. If not for him, they really would be dead. Plus, what they didn't know wouldn't hurt them.\n\"What are the rewards for clearing a Unique Zone like, Uncle Montez?\" Leonel's eyes sparkled.\nLeonel was actually quite excited. The better the treasures were, the easier time he'd have in finding Aina.\nHe didn't know what happened a few days ago, but he suddenly felt that she was in trouble. This sort of feeling left him anxious. Though he had buried it to now, he was all too eager to make his way to Terrain.\nHowever, Leonel didn't expect his question to make Montez solemn once more.\n\"What is it?\" Leonel probed. \"Don't tell me you're going to cheat me again?\"\nMontez sighed. \"It's nothing like that. It's just that the logistics around rewards for Unique Zones are a bit… special.\"\nMontez shook his head. \"Forget it, I will give you your options, but don't take out your anger on me. I'm innocent.\"\nLeonel frowned. What was Montez trying to say?\n\"There are two paths for you to take. If you assess this normally, you can gain rewards as if this was a Tier 9 Black Zone. That way, all your rewards will take a single step up.\"\nLeonel's frown deepened. This wasn't because he didn't like what he had just heard, but because he felt that this was very fair – great, even. But, if Montez was reacting like this, that means that this wasn't fair at all. This sort of reality left Leonel feeling uncomfortable all over.\nIt was as though his ignorance was being used to prey on him. If not for Uncle Montez being on his side in this matter, maybe he would have continued to be ignorant.\n\"The second option… is to hand in all the evidence you gained of the Unique Zone over. Should you choose to do this, your rewards will gain another massive boost. Not only will this Zone be treated as a Tier 9 Black Zone, but you can also pick out a true Bronze Grade treasure of any Tier.\"\nLeonel abruptly stood from the ground, his gaze flashing.\nMontez was a bit stunned by Leonel's momentum, but he remained expressionless, silently waiting for Leonel's choice.\n\"They want to bribe me to cover this up?\"\nLeonel sneered.. It seemed the longer he spent in this world, the more garbage he unearthed.",

      "content": "Montez didn't say anything in response to Leonel.\nThere was no such thing as absolute fairness in this world.\nThe only reason so many worlds had come together to provide rewards to Earth for their progress in clearing Zones was because they saw Earth's potential. There were plenty of other Pseudo Fourth Dimensional Worlds that didn't even qualify to gain such treatment.\nIn addition, this system exposed the underbelly of something far more sinister.\nFor these worlds to so casually hand out such treasures to a fledgling world… how much could they really care about such treasures?\nLeonel couldn't help but laugh inwardly.\nHe and everyone else on Earth were doing all they could to earn these rewards, but weren't these just the scraps left behind by higher worlds who couldn't bother with them anymore? To those lofty beings, what were Black and Bronze treasures to them? They might not even bend down to pick up a Silver Grade treasure off the side of the road.\nYet here he was, jumping like a monkey for them.\nLeonel's rage slowly calmed. What point was there in being angry? He had to clear these Zones one way or another for the sake of saving his home world. Even though he didn't have many positive emotions toward the current Earth, this still remained true.\nSince they wanted to give him their scraps, he would accept them for now. But, he would remember this.\n\"No thanks.\" Leonel said calmly. \"I'll be keeping the evidence to myself.\"\nMontez's gaze sparkled slightly. \"Are you sure?\"\nSuch a choice came with its own consequences. But, Montez was sure that Leonel didn't need this explained to him.\nThis would most definitely place a target on Leonel's back. Not only this, but whatever organization, world or entity that had deemed to act against Earth this time would most definitely be thoroughly offended.\nLeonel had already ruined their long, well laid out plans. If he also didn't know when to take a step back and insisted on pursuing this matter, there would be no repairing such a relationship.\n\"I'm sure.\" Leonel said casually, having already thrown this matter to the back of his head.\nHe almost died not once but twice. In addition to this, these people wanted the resources he rightfully fought to earn. Yet, they wanted to lower his head and accept this trade?\nThough Uncle Montez had only said the word 'evidence', Leonel knew it implied that they also wanted to take the Fourth Dimensional Force Art from him. And to think they wanted to trade a measly Bronze Grade treasure for it.\nLeonel's couldn't help but sneer inwardly. He was pissed.\n\"Alright, alright brat. That's enough of that. You're scaring your uncle making such a face.\"\nMontez smiled, heavily patting Leonel's shoulder as though greatly satisfied. But, that minor action made Leonel feel as though a mountain was landing on him. He could only smile bitterly, just how much more powerful than himself was Montez?\n\"Now, your rewards. This will be designated as a Tier 9 Black Zone, so the rewards will be distributed as such. They will be split three ways, one portion to you.\"\nLeonel nodded. He had left Monet and Violet Rain alone, so he had already expected as much.\n\"For clearing the main quest of saving King Arthur, you'll receive four Tier 9 Black treasures. You failed to clear the side quests, whether that was to kill Mordred or solve the Love Triangle though you made some progress on the harder of the two. So, no rewards for this.\n\"However, you managed to clear the most difficult mission and made Camelot a part of true history.\"\nMontez raised an eyebrow when he said this. It seemed that this wasn't so simple.\n\"Uncle Montez, what exactly does that mean? What changes will happen?\"\n\"Well…\" Montez hesitated. \"The main benefit is the accelerated maturation of Earth. Originally, it should have taken a few more decades for the Fourth Dimension to descend. But, this will happen much sooner, another few years at most.\"\nLeonel fell into his thoughts. He didn't know if this was necessarily a good thing…\n\"Another important change you should consider is the change to overall history. This will cause unique changes to Earth's history and by extension your Zones to appear. It will become more difficult to rely on your understanding of history to clear Zones now.\"\nMontez shook his head. Leonel felt like he wanted to say more, but he was clearly bound by something.\nLeonel had already gotten used to this, Montez had been like this from the very beginning.\n\"Anyway, due to the uniqueness of this hidden quest, the rewards are likewise better than they would usually be. You can gain three Quasi Bronze treasures.\"\nLeonel took a deep breath. To go from a potential reward of true Bronze treasures to Quasi ones didn't feel great, but he could only accept it.\nPlus, Bronze treasures were considered Fifth Dimensional treasures. There was no shame in not having them. In fact, there were many in Fourth Dimensional worlds that couldn't even own a Tier 7 Black treasure, let alone a Quasi Bronze one.\nIt was only a matter of perspective.\nNot only were there many worlds who couldn't even gain this level of support from higher Dimensional worlds, even in those that did… how many could clear Zones as difficult as the ones Leonel had?\nIn addition, in Fourth Dimensional worlds, they had to deal with Fifth Dimensional Zones. Any Fourth Dimensional rewards they had gained in the past were now family heirlooms only passed on to the most worthy or the most talented.\nAs for the rewards from Fifth Dimensional Zones, how could they be so easily grasped? How many could even try to take on such a Zone? Let alone claim the rewards from them?\nLeonel wasn't aware of such things, but he still easily accepted the reality before him. There'd come a day where these lofty beings wouldn't be able to look down on him any longer.\nThe first light of ambition lit within Leonel's heart. Maybe even he, himself, hadn't realized it quite yet, but all of his experiences to this point had been slowly building to this point.. From a boy without aim or goals, he was slowly forming his own path.",

      "content": "'Four Tier 9 Black treasures and three Quasi Bronze treasures…'\nLeonel already knew what he would use his first Tier 9 Black treasure on, he didn't even need to think about it. So, he could be considered to have six choices to make.\n'Should I choose treasures that will make my Tenth Node easier to form?'\nLeonel felt that he was at a point now where he could finally attempt to follow through on his crazy idea. He remembered that there was a point in time he thought that he would need to form his Tenth Node before he could battle Lamorak. But now he realized that he had severely underestimated himself so he was quite curious about just how powerful he would become.\n'I'm not lacking in Force, I still have the stalactite drippings from the hive, Force is probably what I lack the least of…'\nLeonel still had many treasures he had gained from the hive that he had yet to use. For example his 'Mellow Dew Stalactites'. They formed a drop of dew that contained an incredibly high density of Force every so often, they were perfect for a final push of Force when needed.\n\"Uncle Montez, if I want the rest of [Dimensional Cleanse], what do I have to do?\"\nMontez's gaze flashed for a moment. When he scanned Leonel up and down, he was shocked again.\n\"You already formed the Two Star Constitution?\"\nLeonel didn't really know how to respond to this. The creator of [Dimensional Cleanse] had always said that it would be difficult, but Leonel never struggled with it so he never thought it was a big deal at all.\n\"Is that very difficult?\" Leonel asked. \"I think the creator was exaggerating, my Stars always formed right after reaching the Node requirement. I don't feel a bottleneck for forming the Third Star either.\"\nMontez gave Leonel a weird look, but in the end, he kept his words to himself.\nLeonel apparently had no idea that often times, one would wait to complete the foundation of [Dimensional Cleanse] entirely before forming one's Stars. Montez had never heard of it being so easy for someone that their Stars formed automatically.\nIn addition, those who practiced [Dimensional Cleanse] weren't normally people of Leonel's level… And by level, that would refer to how low his world was on the Dimensional rankings.\nMontez sighed and shook his head. \"It's impossible for you to trade for later portions of? [Dimensional Cleanse] with your current rewards. The next part is worth at least a Tier 9 Bronze reward. Of course, if you change your mind and hand in the evidence…\"\nLeonel's expression darkened, but his silence made his stance clear. He had no intention of doing this.\n\"Then what about information for where to find the later portions?\"\nLeonel still remembered the introduction Montez had given him even though it felt like a lifetime ago. Aside from treasures, it was possible to buy information as well. It was just that Leonel never thought he would waste one of his rightfully earned treasures on such a thing. But, he was also aware of just how important [Dimensional Cleanse] was to him.\nIt seemed that even though Montez could bend the rules slightly, he couldn't break them. So, this was the only choice Leonel had left.\nMontez's smile deepened at these words.\n\"It will cost one of your Quasi Bronze treasures.\"\nLeonel nearly stumbled.\nInformation was this expensive? Who the hell was playing a joke on him right now because it wasn't very funny.\nLeonel clenched his jaw. He would definitely remember this moment.\n\"Alright, I'll trade.\"\nWhen Leonel spoke, the magic counter reappeared once again. When it stopped flashing, all that was left was a singular piece of beautifully polished metal. It was incredibly flat and had an almost oval shape.\nLeonel almost immediately recognized the metal. There were many ways of storing information in the universe, the crystals of Camelot were one way and this metal represented another.\nCompared to the crystal of Camelot, 'Memory Ore' could store millions if not trillions of times more information. Memory Ore was able to store and memorize fluctuations of Force and inscribe it onto its chemical structure.\nThe issue with Memory Ore, though, was that it was incredibly difficult to use. And, although somewhat less so, it was also incredibly difficult to read. Only those with high control of their Soul Force could cause the subtle changes needed to jot down information. And, likewise, only those with exceptional sensitivity in the Soul Force could detect these changes.\nAs such, Memory Ore wasn't only useful for holding information, but it was a symbol of skill and status. On top of this, it had the greatest ratio of surface area to memory capacity in the whole of the universe.\nThe moment Leonel saw this Ore, he realized that Uncle Montez was helping him out again. There were many things Leonel was ignorant of, but metals and ores were one thing he was most definitely not.\nMemory Ore alone, disregarding the information within it, was considered a Seventh Dimensional item. Leonel shouldn't even be allowed to come into contact with such a thing, let alone exchanging a mere Quasi Bronze treasure for it.\nLeonel took a deep breath and gave Montez a look, but the latter stared back as though nothing was wrong.\n\"What, you don't want the information anymore? Regretting it?\"\nLeonel almost couldn't refrain from rolling his eyes.\nWith his current level of skill, it was impossible for him to read the information on this Memory Ore. However, even if it would take him a hundred years to do so, it would be worth it. Who could just casually trade for a Seventh Dimensional item?\n\"I'll take it.\" Leonel said solemnly.\n'And I'll remember this.'\nHe spoke these words within his heart. There was no need to say them out loud.\nHe didn't know why Montez had helped him out so much since he had come to know him, but by this point, Leonel didn't care.. There would come a day where he would repay the favor.",

      "content": "Leonel carefully put this Memory Ore away. He didn't know what information it held and he didn't even attempt to read it. If he was too careless, he might disrupt the chemical structure of the ore and destroy the information on it. So, he didn't dare to.\nOf course, this was just Leonel being overly cautious. His current strength couldn't even elicit a reaction from the ore, let alone destroy the information on it. But, regardless, he wouldn't be able to read it now. And, since Uncle Montez wasn't helping him to read it, it was clear that he was unworthy of knowing this information just yet.\nThe bad news was that this meant that Leonel couldn't progress far into the Fourth Dimension for a long while, at least until he could read the contents of this Ore.\nHowever, there was still good news. After all, Leonel now had a path to finding the rest of [Dimensional Cleanse]. And, he had a good feeling that whatever it is he found would be better than what the Tier 9 Bronze reward would have given him.\nIn addition, though Leonel couldn't strengthen himself the conventional way, there were still many other ways for him to do so.\nFor one, there was his ability. Secondly, there was the Four Seasons Realm. And, thirdly, there was still his Soul Force which had vast rooms for improvement.\nThinking to this point, Leonel suddenly felt he had a direction to move in.\nThanks to Camelot fusing with Earth's Fold of Reality, he still had his bow and even his quiver. By Leonel's estimation, his bow was a Quasi Bronze treasure as well that he had yet to get the full potential out of, so there was no need to change it. After all, he still couldn't even pull the string to a full moon.\nAs for the quiver, though it was still Silver and the equivalent of a Tier 6 or 7 treasure, it was serviceable and Leonel didn't feel a need to waste one of his picks on it.\nAfter that, one might think Leonel would choose a defensive treasure. But, Leonel didn't feel like this was necessary. Not only would he soon have the skill he needed to reward his Quasi Bronze chain necklace, thanks to his absorption of Urbe Ore, his body was already about to break past the Standard Stage. Defense was the least of his worries.\n\"Uncle Montez, I'd like a movement technique of the Quasi Bronze level, preferably something that matches well with my Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor.\"\nMontez's gaze flashed once again. 'So he's awakened this as well already?'\nLeonel had decided long ago to go with this route. After he saw the strength of movement techniques thanks to Merlin's trials, he knew he needed something like this very soon.\nMontez clapped his hands and the counter began to flash.\nThe Light Element was rare to begin with. In addition, the Snowy Star Owl was well known for its speed. In fact, the Speed Branch was the only branch awakening Leonel hadn't completed till now.\nThis was all to say that the number of techniques that met Leonel's requirements were pitifully few, even fewer than the number of techniques he had to pick from when he chose [Dimensional Cleanse].\nStill, much like when he chose [Dimensional Cleanse], Leonel felt one calling out to him the moment he laid eyes on it. He didn't even feel the need to look at the others.\n[Gold Feather Step].\nEven without opening the cover, Leonel knew that this was the one. He could faintly feel that it was separated into three different kinds of steps. One projected into his mind like a bird soaring through the skies, the second was like a bird diving with its wings pinned back, and the last was a majestic bird fluttering its wings, vanishing and then reappearing from sight.\n\"This is the one.\"\nLike this, Leonel chose his second Quasi Bronze treasure.\n\"Say… Uncle Montez.\" Leonel's gaze became absentminded for a moment as he held onto [Gold Feather Step]. He felt as though his mind had been taken into an all new world. \"Do you think it's possible to reach the Four Seasons Realm in movement?\"\nMontez's aura abruptly changed, his gaze becoming sharp as though he wanted to look into Leonel's soul. However, after a while, he saw that Leonel was still in a daze as though he wasn't thinking about what he was saying at all.\n'What a little monster… I wonder if he can do it…'\nIf others heard Montez's thoughts, they would think if he was wondering about whether Leonel could succeed in the task he just asked about. Only Uncle Montez himself knew that he was referring to something much grander… Whatever that something grander was, it was related to the question Leonel had just asked.\nA long while later, Leonel finally shook awake and carefully placed [Gold Feather Step] away.\n\"For my last Quasi Bronze treasure, I need a better Force Art Quill. I'm beginning to get a bit limited by my current one.\"\n\"Hoho.\" Montez chuckled and clapped his hands once again.\nFor Leonel to make such a choice, it was clear that his Force Crafting was coming along quite well.\nEventually, Leonel picked out a black quill with sharp silver trimmings. Leonel's last quill came with a wind Force Art that aided in swiftness, but Leonel found it to be a bit gimmicky. This one came with a metallic affinity that added sharpness. Like this, Leonel could use less Force to inscribe on tougher metals. This would help with his accuracy and precision in the long run, not to mention his stamina.\nWith this quill, Leonel might very well be able to pump out Tier 9 Black treasures of his own with consistency from now on.\nAt this point, Leonel had four more treasures to pick. Since one was left for his ticket to Terrain, he had just three.\nLeonel realized that with his skill in Force Crafting, using these rewards on treasures would be a waste. What he needed were things he couldn't build or make himself now or in the immediate future.\nAfter some thought, he decided to ask a question.\n\"Uncle Montez, I have a beast partner with a Dark Elemental affinity. But, right now, the little guy is just an infant and is probably at the best time to help set his future path. He also has a lot of talent, his ability is already within the Bronze Grade despite still being a Third Dimensional creature. Do you have anything that can help him mature along the right path?\"\nMontez blinked.? It seemed like this kid was set on giving him more and more surprises every time they met.\nA Third Dimensional creature with a Fifth Dimensional ability most definitely had an exaggerated growth path ahead of it. If treated properly, this little beast could be a lifelong partner.\nIn addition, since the little mink was born on Earth it had a chance to…\nMontez smiled and clapped his hands once more.",

      "content": "Abilities were an incredibly important part of a person's potential. Even among those of the highest echelon, entities that existed within the Sixth of Seventh Dimension, often, their most powerful tool were their abilities.\nAbilities could transcend strength. An existence like the little mink who had a Fifth Dimensional ability could display combat prowess far beyond the realms of reason. In addition, the little guy also avoided the suppression one would experience upon entering higher Dimensional worlds.\nHowever, at the same time, subduing such a partner was incredibly difficult. The fact Leonel had would of course surprise Montez because the latter knew that Leonel didn't have a beast taming ability.\n\"Bring the little one out.\"\nLeonel nodded and brought Little Blackstar out.\nThe little guy was still in the midst of his dreamland. Rolling over in Leonel's hands, the little mink stuck his little tongue out in a yawn before burying its little head in Leonel's chest.\nMontez's gaze landed on Little Blackstar, observing intently for a while.\n\"The little one is indeed an infant. I'd say at most a few months old, maybe only half a year at most.\"\nWithin a Zone, aging continued as per one's original timeline. But, even if this wasn't the case, the little mink had spent most of the time within Suspended Animation which stopped all biological functions to begin with except for certain exceptions like healing in some cases. Of course, that was only if Leonel allowed it.\nThe fact the little mink was so young made something else make much more sense.\nThe Project Hunt Island should have been properly vetted to maintain a certain level of difficulty. But, Leonel was certain that there was no way anyone other than himself could have dealt with this little mink.\nThe fact the little mink was only born recently somewhat took the Slayer Legion off the hook for such a mistake, albeit just a small bit.\n\"So it's a Shadow Sovereign, huh…?\" Montez mumbled beneath his breath.\n\"Shadow Sovereign?\" Leonel asked.\n\"Shadow Magic is an uncommon branch to run across though it exists. Those who learn it through unconventional means can be considered minor disciples of the practice. Those who inherit it through their Lineage Factor are a step above in this regard and can be considered primary disciples. But, those who awaken it through their abilities are considered of to be of the highest regard and can become Shadow Sovereigns.\n\"Of course, that depends on the evolution potential of said ability. There are often times when a Lineage Factor can surpass an ability.\"\nLeonel's eyes lit up with understanding. It seems that he had underestimated just how important abilities were even now.\nFrom Uncle Montez's words, it seemed that abilities even superseded Lineage Factors. Though this wasn't always the case, it seemed to be enough of a precedent to allow Uncle Montez to say those words with confidence.\n\"If you want to lay a path for the little one, the best choice is to allow it to allow its ability to resonate and synergize with a Lineage Factor. So…\"\nAt that moment, the shifting of the counter had come to a stop and several vials of blood appeared.\n\"Each of these vials of blood will develop the little one down a different path. However, along with these vials, you also need to trade for the method of implementing them. All in all, any choice you make will be worth two Tier 9 Black treasures.\"\nLeonel nodded in understanding. He didn't know anything about using blood to enhance one's ability, but from what he understood about the human body, just drinking it obviously wouldn't help integrate the blood properly.\nOf course, Leonel had no idea that the woman he was always thinking of had done exactly that. But, Aina was a bit of a special case.\n\"Shadow Magic has many potential branches and a wide ranging scope.\" Montez pointed to the first of five vials. \"This comes from an infant Dark Mimicry Bat. Upon maturation it becomes a Fifth Dimensional beast. In fact, this is the same for all the others as well.\n\"Its blood helps enhance the Mimicry Branch of Shadow Lineage Factors. Everyone's shadow is as unique as one's soul. The Mimicry Branch can analyze that uniqueness, snatch it, and make it its own.\"\nLeonel's eyes suddenly widened. \"So that's what that was!\"\n\"Hm?\" Montez sent a questioning look toward Leonel.\nLeonel recollected himself. \"Little Blackstar has a Shadow World within his body. Due to a skill I gained within the Mythological Zone called 'Perfect Union', I can see into it a small bit. But, maybe because the skill is pretty low level, I can only get a vague understanding of it.\n\"But, I once saw a life that I was sure wasn't Little Blackstar's within it. I was wracking my brain, thinking about what it was. But now I feel like it must have been a form of mimicry that Blackstar hasn't quite learned to use yet.\"\nThough 'Perfect Union' sounded, well… perfect, it had ultimately been just a Silver Skill from Merlin's Trials. How could it be as flawless as described?\nThe life that Leonel saw within Blackstar's Shadow World had baffled Leonel for a long time. But, within the Trials, he had chosen to ignore it and focus on what he did understand. After all, he was fighting for his life, he didn't have the luxury to slowly figure things out.\nAnd, now that Leonel thought about it, that lifeform reminded him a lot of…\nLeonel's eyes glowed. Within the Force Core Mine, Little Blackstar had fought Simeon's numbered warriors and killed one of them with a sharp Force ability. Leonel hadn't been able to pinpoint what was so familiar about that life until Montez spoke just now.\nThat much meant that Little Blackstar could elicit the ability of that man!\nBut, how much he could gleam or use and to what level of strength was still questionable.\nIt was just the first vial of blood, but Leonel was already greatly intrigued.",

      "content": "\"Oh…?\"\nThe more Montez learned about this little mink the more curious he became.\nFrom what he knew, Shadow World was an extremely exclusive and legendary ability of Shadow Magic users. The fact this little mink had it meant that it wasn't limited in the Shadow abilities it could use, whether it was the magic system's offensive, defensive, evasive, or auxiliary abilities, he could learn them all.\n\"A good chance that this little one could indeed…\" Montez mumbled.\n\"A good chance? For what?\"\nMontez smiled mysteriously. \"Every world has its own Champions. The Champion of the humans is the wielder of the World Spirit. But, when it comes to newly evolved worlds like yours, beasts are at a great disadvantage… Did you think that the universe just favored humanoid creatures? Of course beasts have their own opportunities.\n\"Whether or not you can find out more will depend on yourself and this little one.\"\nLeonel's gaze sparkled but didn't ask anymore.\n\"This vial is from the Dark Illusion Mouse. It's a creature especially known for its speed and evasive maneuvers. It has the ability to disappear in the shadows and become incorporeal. This falls within the Movement Branch of Shadow Magic.\n\"This vial is from the Purple Red-Eyed Spider. It's known for its corrosive energy. This falls within the Attack Branch of Shadow Magic and specifically within the Corrosive Force Sub-Branch.\n\"This vial is from the Prowling …\"\nLeonel listened to Montez seriously.\nOf the vials, one focused on the Mimicry Branch, one of the Movement Branch, two of the Offensive Branch, and the final was a special case that could fit in the Attack and Defensive Branch.\nLeonel had thought he would settle on the Mimicry Branch the moment he heard about it. This was because the little mink seemed to have already awakened a like ability. Plus, the little guy's attack wasn't lacking.\nBut, after he heard about the final beast, the Undying Abyss Bear, he hesitated.\nThe Bear had a special evolution of Dark Elemental Force that carried some characteristics of a Blackhole. It allowed attacks to be easily nullified, giving it great defenses. But, it likewise had a devastating attack as a result.\nIt was a hard decision, but Leonel ultimately decided upon the Mimicry Branch.\nHis reasoning was simple. Choosing the Undying Abyss Bear blood would be like cornering the little mink's future progress, while the Mimicry Branch was the exact opposite.\nIf Leonel made the foundation of the little mink's ability mimicry, it would lay a foundation that could deviate with endless possibilities. However, if he chose the blood of the Undying Abyss Bear, it would lock in the little mink's Dark Elemental Force to a certain type unless the blood was purged.\nAs long as a proper foundation was laid, anything could be chosen in the future. It wouldn't be too late to give the little mink the Blackhole characteristic by then. But for now, Leonel felt it was smarter to both lay a broader foundation while also following up on the evolution path the little mink was already tending toward to begin with.\n\"I'll choose the Dark Mimicry Bat.\" Leonel said after a long while.\nMontez nodded, exchanging the blood and method of use with Leonel at once. This left Leonel with just one treasure to pick from.\n\"Remember that you're raising this little one as your own. Since you've picked his path, you have to be careful about what you choose for its next evolution. Also, remember that this blood is only supplementary. Your choices are meant to enhance the ability of your partner, not supersede them.\n\"If a human were to take this blood, the effects would be minimal at best, not to mention leave behind lingering injuries. Beasts are somewhat better at consuming blood with the appropriate care and techniques, but the prerequisite is that the blood suits them.\n\"I'm satisfied with your first choice, so don't stray in the future.\"\nHearing these words, Leonel nodded seriously. This dispelled all thoughts he had of potentially using this blood on himself and also left him at a loss for what to use his final treasure on.\nLeonel fell into his thoughts once again.\nAt first, Leonel didn't know what he wanted. But, after a while, he remembered a certain chariot that once made him grind his teeth in rage. Back then, he had suffered a big loss at the hands of Captain Sela. He swore that when he got the chance, he would definitely get a movement treasure of better quality.\nThinking of the Slayer Legion, Leonel's gaze flashed with a cold light.\nAfter a while, Leonel's cold demeanor faded into a grin.\n\"Uncle Montez, I need a ride.\"\n**\nAt that moment, a familiar island was surrounded by a depressing gloom. This island was none other than the very one the Slayer Legion had found the Camelot Zone on. However, compared to the past, it looked much different.\nRaging winds and violent storms had taken hold of the island. The thick trees swayed wildly from side to side, their green leaves flying in every which direction. The ground was soaked completely through, turning the endless greenery into a marsh land that was more reminiscent of a rice farm than a forest. Up above, black clouds rolled and rumbled flashing with vicious arcs of lightning.\nThe shores of the island were a complete mess. The ocean looked like a dense expanse of black, huge waves crashing and rolling onto the sides of the island as though threatening to swallow it whole.\nIt was on this very island and in these very conditions that a fiery argument was taking place.\n\"Do you think that I, Hacker Hutch, am a push over?\"\nHutch stood with a rusted blade, his seemingly old and frail frame standing tall beneath the rushing winds and heavy rain. Under the dark skies, he seemed like a sheathed blade ready to unleash at any moment.\n\"Hutch, I suggest you put the blade away.\"\nA man whose momentum seemed no less than Hutch stood opposing him. Monet and Violet Rain had already exited, but judging by the fact no others had come with them, it was clear that everyone else had died.\nHowever, according to these women, Leonel was just fine.\nHutch had stormed to this place the moment he heard about the actions Monet took behind his back that day. But, by then, they had already long since entered the Zone so he could only wait.\nUnfortunately, his movements had alerted others. And, this matter only blew up further after it was found out that several promising geniuses and Commanders had died within the Zone, one of which actually personally died at Leonel's hand.\nOn the sidelines, Badger stood with reddened eyes, the rain soaking him all the way through. When he heard that Mayfly had died, it hit him like a ton of bricks. Any hatred he held for not being allowed to enter the Zone had been transferred toward his hatred for Leonel. He wanted nothing more than to rip him limb from limb.\n\"Oh? And are you going to take my blade from me, Catris? Come and take it!\"\nCatris' face darkened. His standing was no less than Hutch's, a retired Supreme. So, why would he fear him?\n\"I think it's best you think about your next steps carefully.\" Catris practically growled, his figure seemingly growing by a size beneath his billowing aura. \"Others are already dissatisfied with you. Do you think you can just boot an appointed Supreme from their position just because you feel like it? Did you already forget what happened all those years ago?\"\nHutch's aura sharpened and he sneered a toothy grin.\n\"It seems that my machete hasn't tasted blood in so long that some people really think they can talk to me however it is they want. I'll let you choose. Would you rather lose your left or right arm? Or would you prefer to lose a leg?\"\nHutch's blood thirsty aura caused those spectating members of the Slayer Legion who had been tasked with protecting the island to feel as though their blood had frozen over.\nIt was then that the whirring of the Zone suddenly caught everyone's attention.\nAt that moment, a teenage boy dressed in rags stepped out, his bronze hair becoming practically the only light in this dark atmosphere.\nThe boy yawned. He seemed to genuinely be tired and couldn't be bothered by what was happening around him.\nWhen he wiped the tears from his eyes enough to clear his vision, he saw that he had been surrounded.\n\"Oh? Hey, old man.\"\nThe boy smiled.\nWho else could it be if not Leonel Morales?",

      "content": "Leonel's casual greeting reached all of their ears. At that moment, everyone's attention shot toward the same teenage boy.\nDespite the fact he looked as though he had just crawled out from a garbage dump, he held a certain undeniable valiant air that made him too difficult to ignore.\nLeonel yawned again.\nThis sort of scene, why did it feel so familiar?\nBeneath their gazes, Leonel flipped his palm and allowed numerous snowglobes to appear. Afterward, members of the Adurna family began to appear one after another, plopping to the ground as Leonel released them.\n\"Big Brother Leonel!\"\nNana was the first to recover as she wasn't harmed to begin with. While the others were still in a daze, Nana seemed to realize that Leonel must have been the one that saved them.\nLeonel smiled lightly, patting the little girl's head. Seeing her childish excitement, he could tell just how much the Camelot Zone had weighed on her mind.\nThe second of the Adurna family to come to was their oldest and the man that had been responsible for their lives. However, it seemed that he had failed in his task as a guardian fairly badly. And, to make matters worse, his mind was still foggy. He found it difficult to tell whether or not they were still within a Zone.\nThis elder's name was Matteus. He couldn't help but look toward Leonel with a hint of confusion.\nLeonel only smiled. \"I hope your Adurna family remembers this favor.\"\nMatteus blinked in confusion. Favor? Wait..\nHe looked around and seemed to recognize the island they were on. They had escaped? How? Matteus had been absolutely certain that they would all be dead.\n\"Alright, bye.\" Leonel waved and seemed set to leave, causing many to be shocked.\nCatris' gaze sharpened. Did this boy really not take them seriously?!\n\"LEONEL!\"\nThe roar cut through the heavy rain and rumbling clouds. Even Leonel couldn't help but look back only to see an infuriated Badger. In fact, the latter's skin had reddened to the point that it seemed to steam beneath the rain.\nLeonel frowned slightly. It wasn't only him, but Hutch as well.\nIt had to be remembered that Mayfly and Badger were sent by Hutch in order save Leonel and the others of the island. It could be said that Badger was thus a person of Hutch's. No matter how you looked at it, him standing out now would only muddy the situation.\n\"Do you have something to say to me?\"\nLeonel shifted his gaze toward Badger. How could he not tell why the latter was enraged? However, what did Mayfly's death have to do with him? If he should be blaming anyone, it should be Monet for failing to protect her own. And, even if he didn't want to blame Monet, he should then blame the Adurna family for screwing everything up to begin with.\nThis was a Unique Zone. Deaths were practically inevitable. If the planned dozen had entered, it was likely that the death count would have been the same if not worse.\nBadger fumed beneath Leonel's nonchalance, but he soon calmed, his gaze becoming a smothering volcano that was ready to erupt at any time.\nLarge wings spread from his back. It seemed like he might shoot forward at any moment, ready to risk his life to take Leonel's.\nLeonel shook his head and couldn't be bothered. He didn't want to stir up anymore problems. Before he left Earth, he still wanted to destroy the Royal Blue Fort. If these issues blew up instead, he would have to head to Terrain first and deal with it later. This was obviously something he didn't want to do.\nLeonel was still worried about his teammates. There was no telling if the Junior Governor Duke had chosen to target his friends in his absence.\nIn normal times, Leonel would trust James to protect them, but the event of that month taught him that James truly couldn't be counted upon. When it came down to it, James placed the matters of his family above friendship and comradery.\nIf Leonel thought about it, there wasn't anything necessarily wrong with this approach. If he was asked to choose between his father and his friends, wouldn't the choice be obvious?\nOf course, if others heard Leonel's thoughts, they would think him too cold or calculating. How could one so easily make such a choice? But to Leonel, it was just this simple.\nHowever, it seemed that Leonel wouldn't be getting his wish…\n\"Unauthorized entry into a Zone, hoarding of contraband, and the murder of a fellow soldier.\"\nLeonel's crimes were calmly listed by a familiar feminine voice. He didn't even need to look to know that the person in question was Monet.\nLeonel's gaze swept through the crowd to land on the red armored middle-aged beauty.\nAt this point, Leonel didn't even bother. He took out a talisman. Since he wasn't going to be able to leave here peacefully to do what he needed to do, he would just leave to Terrain now. However, he would remember this.\nHe was certain that by the time he came back, these Supremes wouldn't be able to handle him even if they banded together as one. By then, no one could stop him from doing what he needed to do.\nThe expression of those watching changed. Of all the things they expected, for Leonel to say not a word and truly prepare to leave caught them completely off guard.\n\"Leonel, wait.\"\n\"Hm?\" Leonel paused.\nThere was only one person he would even bother to listen to at this point, and that was obviously Hutch.\nThough Leoenl was a bit unsatisfied with the way the old man had kidnapped him against his will, delaying his plans to raze the Royal Blue Fort to the ground, he still felt that the retired Supreme was a net positive on his life.\nThe old man sighed. \"Just stay, will you? With me here, who would dare do anything to you? If you want, in a few years, I'll even give my Supreme position to you. I'll see who dares to say anything.\"\nHearing these words, others were stunned while Leonel just smiled.\n\"I appreciate the sentiment, old man. But, I think it's best that the Slayer Legion and I part ways from here on.\"\nHutch shook his head. \"They're a bit shameless, but it's still not good to be alone in this new world order. Youths like you need an umbrella to grow beneath.\"\nLeonel grinned. \"Shameless is a good word for it. The people I just saved the lives of are now accusing me of crimes. I wonder how many of them would be alive without me?\"\nMonet's expression turned ice cold, red flames flickering within the depths of her pupils. But, Leonel continued unperturbed.\n\"And I dunno… Something about that umbrella term makes me itch all over.\"\nWith a last smile, Leonel activated the talisman.\n\"I'll be seeing you old man.\"",

      "content": "Everyone watched as Leonel vanished.\nIn truth, it wasn't that they didn't consider the idea of Leonel using one of his rewards for a chance to escape, it was just that none of them had expected him to leave without practically saying a word. Had it not been for Hutch trying to get him to stay, he would have probably spared them all just a single a glance and left.\nIt was pure disdain. He couldn't even bother to try and defend himself regardless of whether or not he was in the right. He felt no obligation toward them.\nYet, somehow, his gaze was burned into all their minds. He never said the words 'I'll remember this' aloud, yet they somehow felt as though it was echoing in their ears again and again.\nHutch sighed and shook his head.\n'Seems that brat is finally slowly awakening to his true self.'\nLeonel's final words constantly reverberated in his mind… 'Something about that umbrella makes me itch all over'…\nSuddenly, Hutch began to laugh. He looked no different from a madman in the midst of the rain. But, no one dared to take a madman holding a machete lightly.\nCatris expression flickered numerous times before it settled into a sneer.\n\"I'll be sure to report all of this back without missing a single detail, Hutch. Not only did you bring such a scourge into the Slayer Legion, you didn't even care that one of the geniuses under your charge died due to his actions.\"\nAt that moment, Hutch seemed to remember something.\nSuddenly, his vision sharpened.\nCatris' hair stood on end. He immediately shot backward, his nerves tense.\nIn that instant, the world seemed to slow. No matter how hard Catris tried to move, he couldn't seem to accelerate. It was as though he had been slowed to slow motion or that the world around him had suddenly been fast forwarded.\nPCHUU!\nBlood spurted as a limb twirled into the air. The crimson was quickly washed away by the endless barrage of rain, but even then, it was just as quickly replaced by a new flow.\nCatris paled, looking down at his right arm which now lay on the ground.\n\"Since you didn't make the choice, I decided to make the choice for you.\" Hutch said casually.\nHis indifferent voice made everyone freeze. His complete nonchalance in the face of blood and gore made them feel as though he wouldn't lose a wink of sleep even if he killed them all one by one.\n\"Consider this a simple reminder that you can't just speak to anyone as you please.\" Hutch continued. \"And, as for the death of Mayfly, you seem to forget that I raised her practically as my own daughter.\"\nThe indifference in Hutch's voice soon became coldness.\nHis gaze swept over, landing on Monet.\nIn that instant, Monet felt as though she had been thrown into an icy hell. Her knees uncontrollably buckled, causing her to almost fall to the ground. All the lofty demeanor she had, even when she was facing the demons of Camelot, came crumbling down with a single look.\n\"I would really like to know what her superior officer was doing as Mayfly died. You all seem to want to focus on the fact that Leonel wasn't meant to enter, when the truth was that Leonel was originally on the list of entries, the one who wasn't was Monet who self inserted. Isn't that right?\"\nMonet shivered.\nThis was true. Originally, Badger and Mayfly were meant to enter as one. They were so used to partnering with one another that the sum of their teamwork was far beyond themselves individually. To say that they could surpass a Supreme when working together wasn't an exaggeration at all.\nThis was the new world order, after all. Being older didn't necessarily mean you were stronger since Earth was still in its infancy.\nMonet grit her teeth and squeezed out all her strength to speak.\n\"Leonel injured Badger before their entry. There was no choice.\"\n\"Oh?\" Hutch laughed as though he was amused that Monet dared to speak back. \"And why would he hurt Badger? Hadn't they just worked together to escape the beast tide on the Project Hunt Island? I wonder what made them enemies in such a short time?\"\nHutch's questions seemed light, but they all put more and more pressure on Monet. The latter felt as though her heart might stop completely if she was pressured any more.\nAt that moment, the situation suddenly changed.\nHutch's gaze narrowed as he looked off into the distance. An older man with a head of white, flowing hair approached with a pair of massive white wings. He looked no different from a deity descending upon the mortal world. Whether it was his demeanor or looks, he seemed impeccable. Even the winds and rain bent around him.\n\"That's enough Hutch.\"\nHutch looked up but didn't say much of anything. He only sheathed his blade and began to walk away with broad steps.\nThe angelic man frowned toward the disregard.\n\"I hope you understand Hutch, that among the retired Supreme, you aren't the only one who's awakened a Variant ability. If you make an enemy of us all…\"\nAt that moment, the angelic man found the world around him slowing. His eyes widened, a blinding golden light emitting from his body. But, before he could react, Hutch had already appeared in the skies, snatching a handful of white feathers and landing heavily on the ground.\n\"I wonder, how many more do you think I need to pluck off before you can't fly above me anymore?\"\nThe angelic man suddenly seethed in rage. But, remembering Hutch's ability, he also felt his heart go cold. Why did such a madman have to awaken such an ability?\nIn the end, the angelic man remained silent, watching as Hutch walked away. Though Hutch seemed slow, he had already left the range of the island in the blink of an eye, gliding over the black, raging waters…\n**\nAt the moment Hutch was gaining some interest for Leonel, the latter had found himself in a completely unexpected situation.\nUnlike Aina, Leonel was teleported to a proper place. There was a well elevated platform located in the middle of a bustling city. In fact, Leonel's initial appearance didn't garner much attention until… well, until it did.\nLeonel hadn't even stepped off the platform yet when a dozen armed guards charged forward, spears and swords in hand as they completely surrounded him.\nLeonel turned his gaze back to the first person he had seen after entering this place. She was a woman of average looks who gained a salary for manning and maintaining the order of the teleportation pad. In fact, Leonel and her had just had an amicable exchange.\nThe dictionary had begun to work again, so Leonel only had to rely on it to communicate in this odd, new language. He didn't think there was a problem with doing so as he had already noticed several translation treasures in the hands? or on the bodies of others.\nBut now, for whatever reason, that same woman who he had just been conversing with was avoiding his gaze.\nLeonel wanted nothing more than to find a hotel and take a nice long sleep. But now he was suddenly being threatened from all sides…\nWhere was the justice?",

      "content": "Leonel was speechless. Just how bad was his luck. He hadn't even been on this world for all of five minutes when he suddenly found himself in a heap of trouble once again. The worst part was… he didn't even know what he had done wrong.\nAt that moment, there were shouts coming at him from all directions, but he couldn't understand anything they were saying. Though it was possible to use the dictionary to translate, that could obviously only be done one at a time, he had no idea what all the fuss was about.\nLeonel closed his eyes and shook his head, willing his fatigue away to deal with the current situation.\n\"Speak one at a time please, I have no idea what you're saying.\"\nLeonel used the dictionary to translate these words, but the shouting didn't seem to stop. In fact, it intensified.\nIt was obvious that these people knew Leonel was a foreigner and this wasn't even an area where foreigners were rare, yet they kept speaking in their native tongue. It was hard to believe that they weren't doing it all on purpose.\nLeonel tried to speak with the lady that received him again, but she continued to avoid eye contact for reasons he was left completely in the dark of. He truly had no idea why he was being treated like this.\nBy this point, a sizeable crowd had been built. After all, this was a bustling city square to begin with and was most definitely a hotspot for tourists. When they saw such good entertainment before them, how could they not take a pause for a look?\nAs more and more people gathered, Leonel suddenly noticed a striking difference between himself and them.\nEverywhere he looked, no matter where it was, everyone was excellently dressed. Even the most modest amongst these people who kept their jewelry to a minimum and refrained from wearing elaborate dresses carved of expensive furs exuded the air of nobility.\nLeonel had always been an observant person. It wasn't a matter of his ability, but rather his social abilities. He realized that in a place like this, considering he was dressed from head to toe in rags… He stuck out like a sore thumb.\n'Is it really because of my clothing?'\nAt this point, the shouting around Leonel seemed to come to a stop which caused Leonel to stop observing his surroundings. A leader of sorts stepped forward and spoke some words.\nLeonel sighed a breath of relief. 'Finally, we're getting somewhere.'\nLeonel could tell that they had stopped their shouting tactic after realizing he wasn't very moved by it at all. He didn't know why these armored warriors wanted to intimidate him, but he could only slowly realize the truth from here on out.\n\"State your name, affiliation and purpose.\"\nThe dictionary translated for Leonel, finally allowing him to tell just what was going on.\n'I need to learn this language as quickly as possible…'\nLeonel didn't feel off put by the question. Even on Earth alone, just traveling from Province to Province elicited questions just like this. It only made sense that it would be asked when it came to travel between worlds.\n\"My name is Leonel, I come from Earth. I'm only here on vacation.\"\nLeonel felt there was no need to speak about his purpose of finding Aina. Speaking truthfully would only raise more questions.\nIn addition, he had no idea what Aina's current situation was, but he still hadn't forgotten that eerie feeling from before. If he wasn't just being paranoid and she really was in trouble, then mentioning the fact that he was looking for her would only put them both in danger.\nThe spectators had much more sophisticated translation treasures than Leonel did. So, they all understood his words practically immediately. But, as a result, they were confused and gave Leonel weird looks.\nEarth? They had never heard of it. Though Earth was greatly valued by higher Dimensional worlds, information about it wasn't quite wide spread yet. These people might look rich, but compared to true nobles, they still had a long way to go.\nThat said, the reason they were giving Leonel weird gazes wasn't because of this. There were too many worlds, how could they know all of them? That was impossible. What they found weird was the fact he said he was here to be a tourist, but if that was the case… why was he dressed like that?\nLeonel, however, was thinking about something completely different. He didn't miss the sharpening of the captain's gaze after he spoke of Earth. Just what was going on?\n\"Come with us for further questioning.\" The captain said coldly.\nLeonel frowned at these words, but the guards seemed to react immediately to his hesitation, placing their hands on their weapons.\n'There's something weird about these guards. They don't seem to be dressed like natives of this land…'\nLeonel separated out everyone he observed into three categories. There were natives, tourists and these guards. Natives all seemed to wear garbs that crossed flexible armor with robes, giving them a distinctive look. These guards, however, had their own mode of dressing.\nEach of them wore fluttering robes but they were split below their waste into four sections. One section to each of the sides of their hips and one to their front and back. This design exposed the metallic sheet armor that covered their legs.\nIn addition to this, each of them had the same design on their lapels, a golden pin that held an oddly shaped star and cross. It seemed to exude a level of authority that garnered the respect of all those that looked at them.\nThe more Leonel observed, the more he felt there was something off about this.\nHe looked back toward the woman who had received him again, not surprised to find her still dodging his gaze. By now, he was certain that these men were called here by her.\nWhat a joke. To think they had just been having a friendly conversation only to find out that she had been stirring up trouble for him.\nThe young woman shivered. Compared to Leonel's previous inquisitive gaze, she could feel the coldness of this one. Her heart skipped several beats, losing its regularity. The change left her unable to breathe properly.\nLeonel looked away. \"I will follow you.\"\nHe regained his calm, glancing toward the captain with an indifferent expression.\nThe captain frowned, but ultimately gave the signal to surround Leonel and escort him away.",

      "content": "The young woman watched Leonel's back disappear into the distance, her breathing still hitching. It was only after a long while that she gritted her teeth in rage. If it wasn't for the fact she was still in public, she would have likely found anything she could to throw and bash around.\n'How dare he! How dare he! How dare he!'\nThe young lady ground her teeth in silence.\n\"Rie? What happened? Who was that guy?\"\nAt that moment, a familiar voice to the young lady stepped forward.\nThe young woman, Rie, looked up to find exactly who she expected to. It was another young woman of similar age and type. They both had decent looks and cute features. It was truly a case of like people attracting one another. From afar, they even looked quite like sisters even though they weren't.\n\"Syl… Ugh, I thought you said that this job would be easy?\"\nSyl giggled, rounding Rie's desk and hooking her arm around her friends.\n\"You've already had this job for years. Now that you've soaked up all the benefits, you want to come back here and blame me?\"\nIt seemed that Syl had quite the standing. If not, how could she have possibly helped Rie gain such a position?\nSyl seemed quite amused by her friends complaining and wanted to ask more, but the teleportation pad suddenly lit once again.\nRie hid her dissatisfaction and politely greeted another client. After some pleasantries, she sent this person on their way and sat back down in a huff.\n\"Now can you tell me what happened?\"\nRie pouted. \"With your connections, you could easily find out. Why make me talk about something that makes me upset? What kind of friend are you?\"\nSyl giggled. \"Second and third hand information isn't as good as the real thing. Come on, don't hold out on me. Plus, you know that my family doesn't have much jurisdiction over them…\"\nWhen she said these words, Syl's playful expression became a tad bit more solemn. But, regardless she still pressed Rie for answers.\nRie sighed and caved in.\n\"A couple months ago, they briefed all of us attendants on some new information. Apparently they're cracking down on fugitives and escapees. Whenever I see a sign of suspicious activity, I'm supposed to make small talk with the suspect and secretly call for reinforcements. But this bastard actually glared at me like that just because I was doing my job.\"\nSyl's eyes sparkled. \"A crackdown? Why? Who are they trying to catch? Who would be bold enough to become a fugitive in the eyes of those people?\"\nClearly, to Syl, this wasn't a normal case…\nLet's just say that becoming a fugitive of a world or even a network of worlds wasn't as bad as becoming a fugitive in the eyes of these people.\n\"I don't know anything, I just followed their orders.\" Rie said with an exasperated sigh.\nSyl giggled. \"He only glared at you a bit, is there a need to be so angry?\"\nRie gave her own glare at these words. \"You don't get it. I thought I was going to die. A measely Third Dimensional brat actually pressured me, how embarrassing.\"\nSyl blinked. \"He was in the Third Dimension yet you still called them for him?\"\nRie froze for a moment. Then, she blushed profusely. It seemed she realized she had done something wrong.\nThat was right, how could someone in the Third Dimension be who they were looking for? It was no wonder he glared at her.\nAfter a while, Rie regained her bearing and bit her teeth. Even if she made a mistake, there was no need to treat her like that. What a bad guy. What good was being a bit handsome if you were so weak?\n\"Hmph.\" Rie finally snorted. \"If I see him again, I'll definitely have sister-in-law teach him a lesson.\"\nSyl burst into a fit of giggles.\nThis 'sister-in-law' Rie was referring to was actually her own sister-in-law. Syl had an elder brother who treated the both of them like his own little sisters. So, despite the fact they weren't blood related, Rie still called her sister-in-law.\nOf course, there were deeper matters in relation to this oddity, but they were unimportant at this moment.\n\"It's really curious, though.\" Syl said after a moment. \"Isn't it supposed to be a struggle for those in the Third Dimension to adjust to a Fourth Dimensional world? Where did he get the strength to glare at you?\"\nRie froze again, seemingly stumped once more.\nSyl giggled and shook her head. This friend of hers had always been a bit simple. If not for this, she would have helped her get a far more prestigious job than this.\nThough this gig paid well and was very stable and safe, it wasn't exactly the most esteemed.\n\"Young Miss.\"\nJust when Syl wanted to speak with Rie a bit more, a strict voice sounded from her back.\nTo her back, there was an inconspicuous man with sparse hair. He was well dressed and groomed, while his hands were perpetually clasped behind his back. However, the way his hair fluttered about like the wings of a bird made it difficult for Syl to take him very seriously.\nThat said, this was only because she knew that this old man would never harm her. For others, if they saw this old man, they would head in the opposite direction 99.99% of the time. The remaining percentage point was an unknown variable. After all, the dead couldn't testify.\n\"Already?\" Syl pouted.\n\"Yes, this is very important Young Miss. The City Lord isn't willing to compromise on this.\"\nSyl sighed and shook her head. She knew that talking wouldn't do her any good.\n\"Fine, fine. Let's go. I'll see you later, Rie.\"\n\"Okay.\" Rie waved her friend goodbye.\n**\nAt that moment, Leonel sat in a blank room. This was the best way he could describe it.\nThe walls were a dull gray. The singular chair he sat on was a dull gray. The singular table before him was a dull gray. It was even difficult to see the outline of the door to this place. It was as though Leonel had been tossed into a cube with no exit.\nAfter a few minutes turned to almost an hour, Leonel felt a keen sense of dejavu. He had a flashback to the time Pope Margrave wasted his time. But, this time, he didn't have the option to leave at all.\nLeonel yawned.\nSince they wanted to make him wait, that was fine.\nLeonel took out a pillow and a blanket, climbed onto the table, and fell into a deep sleep.. Soon, the sound of light snoring filled the small room.",

      "content": "Leonel fell into a deep sleep almost immediately. Of course, he was using the meditation rest technique his father had taught him. But, to the outside world, he was out cold without any understanding of what was happening around him.\nWhen Leonel entered this place, he realized many things.\nFor one, these people didn't take him very seriously. They didn't restrain him nor did they take his things away. It was very likely they believed he was weak.\nLeonel didn't mind allowing this illusion to continue. But, at the same time, he knew that it very well may not be an illusion at all.\nLeonel had never seen a Fourth Dimensional entity battle. However, according to the information he had, no matter how powerful one was within a lower Dimension, it was impossible to challenge a higher one with very few exceptions. Leonel didn't know how true this was or if the Crystallization of his Force could help bridge this gap, but he didn't feel like finding out by putting his life on the line.\nAll Leonel knew was that if he didn't rest his mind, he would be at an even greater disadvantage. So, that was exactly what he did. Without a care for anything going on around him, he entered a deep dreamland.\nBy some stroke of coincidence, or maybe due to the fact Leonel was right about them not taking him seriously, no one was monitoring Leonel.\nThey likely believed that they could sweat Leonel out just like any other prisoner. If they let him sit alone for a long while, he'd probably spill out everything he knew when he finally saw another person.\nUnfortunately, due to their lack of bothering to monitor him, none of them realized that the young man they thought they were pressuring was taking a nice nap.\n**\nAcross the universe it could be said that there were countless centers of power. But, more often than not, these powers would have the shadow of stronger entities to their backs, and those stronger entities would have even stronger backers.\nThis was simply the way of the world.\nOn Earth, which county didn't have a city backing it? Which city wasn't backed by a state or province? Which state or province didn't have a country behind it? This was simply how things functioned.\nIn this new world order where having and not having resources was the difference between life and death, powers who could stand to support others had their hands in as many pots as possible.\nWhen things are put into this perspective, it truly isn't a surprise that Earth was targeted in such a way. Even under the protection and overwatch of so many powerful existences, there were some with enough backing that still dared to make a move.\nIn such a complicated environment, it was too difficult to hold such powers accountable for their actions. So, they acted with impunity. And, if they failed, so what? Who would call them out for it?\nOf course, there were some that tried to call out the wrongs of these powers. But, how long did these foolish individuals survive for?\nOnce again, it seemed as though someone didn't know their place…\n…\n\"Aliard has died.\"\nThe room wasn't dark and sinister as one might expect. In fact, it was well lit and lavishly furnished. And, as though to prove that these entities truly had nothing to hide or didn't deem it necessary to hide anything, this meeting took place within the private room of a bustling high-class restaurant.\n\"Oh? That's unfortunate. I assume everything was handled appropriately?\"\nSilence fell over the room. This lack of response seemed to catch everyone's attention. Their careless demeanors paused for a moment in place of several sneers.\n\"So it seems someone else doesn't know their place? Just deal with them as usual.\"\nEveryone around the table seemed to agree with this. It seemed that there was no need for further discussion.\n\"Leave it to the head of that Quadrant.\"\n\"Agreed.\"\nThe conversation started and ended just as quickly. To these men and women, what was a small fry from a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional world even worth? The fact they wasted a few seconds of their day on such an ant was already too much respect in their eyes.\n**\nThe decision of these entities quickly moved down the ranks, jumping through several chains of command before finally making it the ears it needed to make it to.\nThe man was tall and lanky, carrying a pale complexion that made it seem as though he was either a foot into the grave or one step out of it.\n\"Commander Scithe.\"\nAn attendant respectfully knelt before the man, yet he didn't even turn back.\nHe stood looking out a wide, curved window. Stars and asteroids shot across his vision as planets and moon shone beautifully in the distance. It was the kind of scene only a handful of people from Earth had seen personally. Yet, in this new world order, anyone with a little bit power could lay eyes on such a scene.\nDespite the lack of an answer, the attendant didn't dare to make another sound, continuing to kneel in silence.\nEventually, he spoke.\n\"Leave the information here. You can go.\"\nThe voice sounded just as dead as the man's sunken expression. Who knew if it was because it had been too long since his last meal or if this man was really dead, but his skin was pressed so flush against his cheeks that it seemed the bone might tear through it at any moment.\nScithe picked up the files as the door to his office was closed.\nWhen he finished reading them, a flicker of disdain couldn't help but flash within his eyes.\nLeonel Morales? They wanted him to personally take care of a brat? Was this supposed to be a joke?\nScithe shook his head and pressed a button.\n\"Find out for me where this Leonel Morales is. It's too painful to descend to the Pseudo Fourth Dimension, I expect no mistakes or else I'll have your head.\"\n\"Yessir!\" A voice came from the other side.\nScithe walked back to enjoying his view, the clanking of his armor being audible with his every step.\nIf Leonel had been there, he would have noticed an eerily familiar uniform.\nRobes that split into four pieces at the waist.. Legs covered in sheet armor beneath them. A pin that looked like the cross between a star and cross on the lapel…",

      "content": "The sudden opening of a door shook Leonel out of his sleeping state.\nHe yawned and stretched, sitting up from the table.\nHe had to say that sleeping on a table wouldn't have been the most comfortable experience for him in the past. But, after practicing to the Standard Stage, it might as well have been a soft bed to the current him.\nLeonel wiped the tears and sleep from his eyes, finally locking eyes with those that walked into the room.\nThere were two individuals, one man and one woman. They both wore the same split robes and metallic leg sleeves.\n'These uniforms are quite cool.' Leonel thought playfully to himself. 'I wonder how I can join?'\nOf course, Leonel was just having a joke at the expense of himself. With his luck in joining organizations, he'd probably be being hunted to his death within another few days. Still, that didn't change the fact he felt these outfits were quite stylish. Sometimes even Leonel himself forgot he was a teenage boy.\nCoach had always said: 'Look good, play good'. The better one felt, the better they could perform. It seemed that this organization, whatever it was, seemed to take this quite seriously as well.\nWhile Leonel was observing the pair, the two of them were looking toward him with incredulous expressions. Wasn't this young man supposed to be sweating their appearance? Why the hell is it that he was sleeping?\nThe young woman wrinkled her nose. It seemed that a negative effect of locking Leonel in here for so long was that his smell had been highly concentrated into this area.\nLeonel slid off the table and put his blanket and pillow away. Flakes of dried blood fell from his body and coated the table, but he didn't bother to clean it. He felt the cleanliness of the room had nothing to do with him, quite frankly.\nThough he had been cleansed twice by his Two Star Constitution and could even stay fresh for longer than normal humans, given enough time, he would still end up in such a state. He was still very much mortal.\nLeonel sat down on the chair as though nothing had happened and smiled lightly.\n\"Might I ask what I've been brought in for now?\"\nCompared to the first time they saw him, Leonel gaze was much sharper and focused. It seemed that he had really needed that nap. It seemed it might have been an issue to leave him here alone for so long.\nHearing Leonel's question, the pair soon regained their level of professionalism, sitting across from Leonel as though they couldn't see the flakes of blood and dirt on the table or smell the horrid stench in the air.\nLeonel took out the dictionary and placed it on the table to help him translate.\n\"It's our job to monitor suspicious activity.\" The man replied with a deadpan expression. \"In addition, you match the description of several fugitives we've been looking for.\"\nLeonel smiled bitterly, it seemed that it really was his style of dress that got him thrust into this situation. Had he taken his time to clean up, maybe he wouldn't even be here.\n\"I apologize for giving that sort of impression. The reason I look like this is because I recently cleared a Sub-Dimensional Zone on my home world and used one of my rewards in exchange for a ticket to Terrain. In my excitement, I came here right after I left without thinking things through. I've never left my home world before.\"\nLeonel explained his side of the story politely. Of course, much of it was a lie and in some ways, he really could be considered a fugitive. At the very least, he had run away from his home planet for reasons. But, they didn't need to know that.\n\"Plus…\" Leonel said with a bitter expression. \"… I'm just a Third Dimensional existence from a new world, how could I be one of the fugitives you're looking for?\"\nThough the pair before him didn't react much to his words, Leonel's senses were exceptionally keen. He could see that they had already believed as much before even stepping into this room.\nLeonel wasn't sure why they brought him in. It might have been to do their due diligence or for another reason he was unaware of. But, he could tell that they didn't truly plan on punishing him.\nSometimes people with power just enjoyed wasting the time of those beneath them. Leonel felt that this might just be one of those cases.\nStill, since he was weak and had no backing, this was simply one of those things he had to accept with a smile on his face even though he was furious inside.\nAs expected, the pair didn't respond directly to Leonel's question.\nThe female flipped her palm and took out a folder of documents.\n\"You will be monitored by our people for the next three years. As long as you do nothing to violate the laws, you will be relieved of this mark on your record.\"\nLeonel's smile suddenly faded into a deep frown.\nThey wanted the right to monitor him for three years despite the fact he hadn't done anything wrong? What kind of nonsense was this? Was this supposed to be some sort of joke?\n\"You want to monitor me for three years despite the fact I haven't done anything wrong?\" Leonel asked coldly.\nThe man sneered. \"If you haven't done anything wrong, what's the issue with being monitored?\"\nLeonel nearly snapped at this sort of reasoning. If it wasn't for his better judgment, he might have just pulled out his spear right then and there.\nMaybe in the past, Leonel wouldn't care as much about this. After all, he truly had done nothing wrong and thanks to his experience with The Empire, he was already used to his every action being monitored.\nHowever, it was precisely because of The Empire that he was becoming more and more sensitive to such things. And, it only made things worse that he was being treated like this just due to ridiculous, unwarranted suspicion.\nLeonel's jaw clenched, his gaze turning a frosty shade of green.\nWithout a word, he signed the documents before him.\nAs though a contract had bound him, the documents glowed.\nBefore Leonel could react, a light shot from within the documents and onto his forehead. A moment later, a thin black brand spread between his brows as though marking him.\nLeonel's fury was stoked several more levels. He had already read through the documents and knew that this would happen, but when he actually felt it, he couldn't help but feel the urge to do something he would regret.\nSeeing Leonel try to maintain control over his emotions, the woman remained expressionless while the man sneered. So what if he was angry?\nHe was branded like a slave and couldn't even do a thing about it.",

      "content": "Leonel closed his eyes, the tumultuous flow of his blood slowing down to a crawl. Rage wouldn't get him anything, anger wouldn't get him anything.\nAfter a long while, Leonel slowly stood and walked toward the door. He didn't say anything toward the female-male pair. Nothing he said would have changed anything to begin with.\nSeeing Leonel's reaction, the young woman remained expressionless while the male's sneer deepened. Wasn't this sort of reaction obvious? Even if Leonel felt wronged, so what? He may have been worth something on his own world, but in this place, he was nothing but an ant that could be squashed at the whims of others.\nLeonel stepped out from the room and left.\nEven without stepping foot outside the building, he could feel the glances he received as though each was boring into his very being. The mark that hovered above his forehead was too distinctive. Anyone could see it at a single glance.\nLeonel didn't even bother to try and cover it up. He knew that there would be no point. If a simple head band could circumvent such a thing, whatever organization this was truly wouldn't be worth very much to begin with.\nEventually, Leonel pushed open the doors and stood at the top of a tall and wide set of stairs. For this organization to hold such a large property in such a bustling city, their standing was clear. Every square inch in a place like this likely cost an astronomical amount. As someone from Earth who was familiar with overpopulation problems, Leonel knew this more than others.\nLeonel looked up to the top of the building, seeing the very same star and cross symbol.\nTo this point, he still didn't know what the title of this organization was, nor had anyone ever mentioned it to him. It seemed to be one of those things that everyone knew of, but also didn't dare to speak of easily.\nConsidering his style of dress, where he stood, and what hung above his forehead, Leonel stood out like a sore thumb. There was no limit of individuals who observed him from afar, whispering to one another.\nHowever, Leonel continued to stand there as though burning the image of that star and cross into his mind. Then, he turned and walked away.\n**\n\"Impossible, we don't accept your kind here. Please leave.\"\n…\n\"All of our rooms are booked, sir. Please accept our greatest apolo – Ah! Yes, right away. The room has already been cleaned and prepped. This way please.\"\n…\n\"Scram! I don't care if you're willing to pay double!\"\n…\nLeonel expressionlessly strolled out of his final attempt. He felt nothing but numbness by this point.\nAfter a while, he looked up toward the setting sun. It seemed as though the whole day had already gone by.\nIn truth, he hadn't spent the whole day searching for accommodations. Most of the time had been wasted away in that organization's building. It was only the past half an hour that he had spent moving from location to location, hoping to find a place of residence.\nThough Leonel had the Segmented Cube, he knew that he couldn't so easily or casually use it. This was no longer Earth, there were plenty of people he had to fear here.\nAs of now, he had only used the dictionary as a translator, so no one grew greedy about it. Who would care about such a primitive translation treasure? However, the Segmented Cube was a spatial treasure capable of housing life. If others came to know of it, Leonel would be hunted to the ends of Terrain.\nLeonel saw a food stall in the distance and suddenly realized it had been a long time since he ate anything that he didn't roast himself. Though he had a practically infinite supply of meat thanks to the snowglobes, it got bland eating nothing but unseasoned meat all the time.\nHowever, before Leonel could even approach, the middle-aged woman who ran the stand gave him a stare as though daring him to come and suffer the consequences.\nLeonel shook his head and sighed.\nThere was no purpose in staying in this city anymore.\nLeonel felt several eyes on him as he walked toward the outside of the city.\n'How am I supposed to find Aina like this…'\nNo one would give Leonel the time of day. Not only could he not find a place to stay, he couldn't find a place to eat. As he was now, it would be impossible to gather any information. How could he if no one would talk to him?\nThey say that this mark is only supposed to be a sign of suspicion and not criminality, but who would want a suspicious person around them? It was practically guaranteed to stay this way.\n\"The City Gates will be closing in half an hour and will not open again until dawn tomorrow.\"\nThough the guard could see the mark on Leonel's forehead, he still casually said these words. After all, it was his job to say at least this much. That said, he didn't even look directly at Leonel as he spoke.\nLeonel just shook his head and bitterly laughed.\nStay in the city? For what? To sleep on the streets? What was the point of that?\nAt least if he left the city he could take another rest in comfort so long as he found a deserted region. Also, clothing stores refused entry, so unless he repaired his chain necklace, he would have to make his own clothing. Either way, he would only be able to do this with his Segmented Cube, and he would only be safe to use his Segmented Cube if he left this place.\n\"Thanks.\" Leonel said noncommittedly.\nThe guard and his colleagues shook their heads and soon began to converse amongst themselves, not minding Leonel anymore.\nIt was just when Leonel was almost out of ear shot that he heard something that caught his interest by relying on the dictionary.",

      "content": "\"Another fugitive, tsk.\"\n\"Technically no, that was just a mark of suspicion. They're only monitoring him. Poor guy probably just got caught up in something that was over his head.\"\n\"Whatever it is, he's pretty stupid to leave the city. He's just asking to die. He hasn't even stepped out of the Third Dimension yet but he wanted to survive outside of the City Walls? Who do you think he'll fall to, an Invalid or a beast? Let's place some bets.\"\nThe guards spoke as they pleased. To them, it was impossible for Leonel to hear them from so far away. And, even if they knew he could hear them, it was highly unlikely that they'd even care enough to stop.\n\"Well, what's his alternative? He probably couldn't find a place to stay and he was probably stupid enough to come here with a one way ticket. You think someone like him could even afford a ticket back to his own world?\"\nLeonel smiled bitterly. That was true, he had no way back to Earth for now. Though, that wasn't because he couldn't afford it.\nUnlike Earth, Terrain had teleportation pads. This meant that Leonel didn't need to enter a Zone to earn a Tier 9 Black reward to go back. He just had to pay the appropriate fee.\nThere were only two issues with this: first, he needed Earth's coordinates.\nThis was simple enough, he could just ask the dictionary about it.\nThe second issue as much harder to deal with: he had to actually be allowed to leave.\nEven though no one had ever said anything about his travel being restricted, the teleportation pads were still owned by the cities. Just like he could be rejected from entering their hotels, he would be stopped from using their other services as well.\nAs for why people who apparently couldn't stand his guts would stop him from leaving, that had an explanation as well… No one wanted to be complicit in the escape of a 'suspicious' entity. There was no way they'd help him.\nThe guards laughed amongst one another.\n\"Still, who do you think those fugitives they're looking for are?\"\nThe guards fell into silence. All of them looked toward the rookie that asked such a stupid question as though they couldn't wait to skin him alive.\nThe rookie, seemingly realizing he said something wrong, lowered his head. He didn't even mumble an apology, hoping that no one acknowledged what he had just asked.\nThey all knew that Terrain was currently in a state of turmoil, a crossroads of sorts. Some wanted to ensure their world reached the Fifth Dimension while others felt that doing such a thing was useless.\nAs though the internal conflict wasn't bad enough, there were people pulling strings from the background… and it could be said that those who were pulling these strings were quite invested in ensuring that Terrain abandoned its chances of becoming a Fifth Dimensional world.\nLeonel found the sudden silence of the guards to be quite interesting. It seemed as though this was another open secret everyone was aware of but didn't dare to speak of.\n\"Anyway!\" The rookie tried to change the subject. \"I heard that another power suffered a loss at the hands of the Sword Monstress.\"\nThe guards looked at the rookie weirdly.\n\"What kind of name is that supposed to be?\"\n\"How am I supposed to know? I'm not the one that came up with the name. I hear she's a woman and a monster, so they call her the Monstress. They say she's built and looks like a gorilla and wields a three-meter-long sword, thus Sword Monstress.\"\nThe guards looked at one another all simultaneously sent a kick toward the rookie. What a lame story.\nLeonel shook his head and left. They weren't talking about anything he was interested in any longer.\n**\nA long while later, the road Leonel traveled along began to grow less and less well kempt.\nIt slowly became narrower and less paved. Soon, weeds and grasses began to spring up all along it.\nBy now, Leonel had left the range of the city. Anyone who was hoping to reach the City Gates within the next half hour before closing had long since passed him by. It was safe to say that he was fairly alone at this point.\nSoon, the flat land began to turn into a forest that quickly grew in density.\nAfter reaching this point, Leonel entered a state of high alert.\nOn his way here, he had crossed two groups heading toward the city. But, both of them had had individuals he felt could squash him luck a bug. If it wasn't for his rags and his weakness, there was no telling if he would have been robbed and killed or not.\nThis told him two things.\nFirst, this meant the Fourth Dimension was a completely different animal. Leonel didn't know why he didn't feel the pressure of this world, but he knew that he couldn't underestimate it just because of this.\nSecond, Leonel realized that having such powerful people in your midst was practically a necessity if he wanted to travel through this world…\nOf course, Leonel had one advantage: his Internal Sight.\nHe could trust it in most cases and dodge danger before he even reached it. After Crystallizing his Spirit Pressure, he could see up to half a kilometer away even in this Fourth Dimensional world. Back on Earth, his range was easily over a kilometer.\nLeonel could only hope that a half kilometer and his instincts were enough to keep him safe.\nAfter he traveled a decent enough depth, Leonel began to sink into the ground.\n'… It takes more Force now..'\nLeonel frowned, but he could only keep pouring his Force out. He had already been aware that multiple things would be more difficult after coming to a Fourth Dimensional world. He could only accept it.\nSoon, Leonel's head had disappeared from the surface, completely vanishing.\nHe had one main goal in mind. He had to finish his Force Crystallization and complete his Tenth Node.. Only then would he had some more assurance in staying in this backwards world.",

      "content": "Leonel sunk deep into the ground and summoned the Segmented Cube.\nTruth be told, he didn't feel 100% safe in this region. There was no telling what kind of powerful beasts could burrow through the ground. In addition, as things stood now, he was still being tracked. There was also no telling what those people would do with that information.\nLeonel shook his head and entered the Abode Setting. He had no idea how he could possibly get so unlucky to land himself in this situation. But here he was, he could only make the most of it.\n'Could it be that something like this happened to Aina too?'\nLeonel's heart suddenly clenched. He remembered that when he sent Aina here, they had quite literally just survived a bombing. It could even be argued that her state was worse than his current own. On top of that, she was severely injured and a beautiful woman alone in this world. There was no telling what could happen.\nLeonel thought back to that bad feeling he had had and clenched his teeth.\nA murderous aura seemed to still the air around him. Leonel hardly noticed it, nor did he realize when he could suddenly exude such bloodthirst. But, all he knew was that if they dared to touch one hair on her head… He wouldn't care about what consequences going against them could bring.\nLeonel stripped himself of his clothes and began to slowly wash himself.\nIt was hard to tell if he was being deliberate or not, but his movements were paced and methodical as though each and every one of his actions had the utmost importance.\nAfter a long while, he was cleaned and refreshed. Then, he took entered his room and sank into his bed, falling asleep once again.\n**\nLeonel awoke feeling better than he ever had. His body felt like a powerful spring, ready to launch itself into the skies. His injuries were completely healed, even ones hidden well within the depths of his being. And, his mind was clear, even clearer than it had been after his first nap.\nWith that, he entered the Lab Setting and set his sights on the many blueprints his father had left behind.\nTruthfully, these blueprints didn't have some powerful, nation rending treasures depicted on them. Rather, they were mostly written as guiders to Leonel's training. As such, most of them were actually related to aspects of forming Divine Armor as it was an outrageously complicated process.\nThe general rule of Force Crafters was that treasures with more parts tended to be more complicated. So, one could imagine how difficult forming one's Divine Armor was. Even the simplest designs would have upwards of 40 to 50 parts, something that was far beyond the current Leonel.\nThat said, Leonel wasn't looking toward these blueprints to start on his Divine Armor. As things stood now, that wasn't a valuable use of his time.\nLeonel scanned through and picked out a blueprint before unfurling it on his Crafter's table.\nThe design that revealed itself was a simple set of clothes that could provide decent defenses. At the very least, they wouldn't break so easily in battle and would also help Leonel stand out less. After all, the sweatpants of Earth looked quite odd in this new world.\nOne of the most important parts about forming Divine Armor was understanding the human body and how it moved in relation to its parts. Tailoring clothing was one of the first steps that his father had laid out for him.\nLeonel memorized the blueprint and imprinted it into his mind using Dream Sculpt. Then, he began to choose materials.\nLeonel's snowglobes were filled with Third Dimensional beasts thanks to his time on the Project Hunt Island. Picking out beasts with sturdy hides was just a matter of reaching out a finger and pointing.\nLike this, an odd scene of a naked boy tailoring his first set of clothing could be seen.\n**\nFUU!\nLeonel patted down his robes, causing them to slam down against his body in a whipping motion.\nThey had a heavy, leathery texture to them and were a deep black. They followed a similar design to the clothing of that star and cross organization and split at his waist. But, since Leonel didn't want to get into any unnecessary trouble he only split it down once from just below his belly button. That way, the robes wouldn't obstruct his movements despite their heft.\nCompared to the robes, Leonel's pants were much looser and freer. They were made of an exceptionally light material and fluttered with the slightest movement. If one looked closely, it was clear that it wasn't the material that was light as much as the Force Arts Leonel wove into it made it so.\n'Good enough.' Leonel nodded to himself, slicking his hair back.\nHis long hair was really getting to be a problem, but cutting it was even more difficult. In fact, as he progressed through strengthening his body, it only got tougher and tougher. Leonel no longer had the means to cut his hair even if he wanted to as it seemed to be even more powerful than his body.\nToward this issue, he could only shake his head and let his bronzed hair sway toward the small of his back. He could only hope he didn't become a male Rapunzel in the future.\nLeonel took off his robes, leaving him shirtless. Now that he had some real work to do, there was no need to leave such heavy protection on.\nLittle Tolly shot up excitedly, bouncing across the table like a little silver basketball.\nLeonel smiled. Ever since Blackstar went into a deep sleep, this little one had been feeling lonely. Even though the two were always at each other's throats, Leonel could tell that they were a bit fond of one another.\nThe main reason Leonel left his Zone later than Monet and Violet Rain was because he had used his remaining time with Uncle Montez to infuse the mimicry blood into Little Blackstar. That way, he could assure that absolutely nothing went wrong.\nSo, right now, Little Blackstar was assimilating with the blood. But, by the time Leonel finished, the little guy should be up and raring to go.\nLeonel took a deep breath and began to meditate. He was very close to reaching perfection in his Crystallization.. Once he did, it would be time.",

      "content": "The days slowly ticked by, but Leonel hardly noticed them. His body was as light as a feather, following along a natural progression that didn't even seem difficult to him.\nThen, one day…\nBANG!\nSHUUUUUUU!\nA hot steam shot all around Leonel's body.\nWell, at first look it was just steam. But, upon second inspection, one would be shocked to find that it was actually Force. Tangible Force!\nThis wasn't the kind of Force only those with Internal Sight could see. Even mortals who hadn't come into contact with Force a day in their lives would very clearly be able to see it. This sort of shocking Crystallization was the likes of which even King Arthur hadn't reached!\nLeonel took a deep breath.\nAll the dense fog around him seemed to surge into his body, entering through his pores and boring into his soul, leaving him feeling incomparably refreshed.\n'I did it… This should also be the Strong Stage…'\nLeonel realized that when his body suddenly sucked in all his Force like that, his body broke through another shackle and reached the Strong Stage.\nIt had to be remembered that refining one's Metal Body in the Third Dimension was split into five phases. The Weak, Standard, Strong, Superior and Perfection stage. This could be considered the foundation one laid to enter the Fourth Dimension.\nThis was another reason Leonel wasn't worried about not having the rest of [Dimensional Cleanse] just yet. Even if he couldn't progress to the Fourth Dimension with his Force, he could still do so with his Soul Force, he could still comprehend the Four Seasons Realm, and he could also bring his Metal Body into the Fourth Dimension as well.\nRegardless of which of these three paths it was, each of them would give him the strength of a Fourth Dimensional entity. So, what did it matter?\nAs things stood now, if Leonel wanted, he could bring his Metal Body to the Fourth Dimension this very instant. But, as a person who opened all Nine Doors, how could he waste his potential like that? He had to reach Superior Stage at worst before progressing.\nLeonel flexed his forearms.\n'My body is already nearing the strength of a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional Ore. It wouldn't be easy even for Fourth Dimensional entities to harm me…'\nLeonel took a deep breath. This gave him even more assurance to form his Tenth Node. He knew that no matter how much he planned it all out, the process would still be impossibly painful. After all, he was trying to break through restrictions set by the universe itself. Even if this could be considered to be a minor restriction in the grand scheme, to the current Leonel, it was an insurmountable mountain.\nLeonel took a deep breath to adjust himself. Then, he took another long bath and deep sleep before finally returning, his body brimming with vitality.\nNo matter how you looked at him, Leonel seemed to be a pointed spear. All the hatred, humiliation and grievance he had suffered those few days ago seemed to become his whetstone, sharpening his edge to unimaginable degrees.\n\"Let's begin.\" Leonel spoke to no one in particular.\nHis breath shot out like an arrow, trembling the space before his lips.\nHe sat crossed legged, a vial of thick, milky liquid in his hands. This was none other than the Dew he had collected in the several months he had the stalactite for. Just a single drop was more than enough to form a Node, but Leonel actually had almost a dozen.\nIn that moment, Leonel began to circulate [Dimensional Cleanse] in full force. The speed of his rotation his Stars experienced accelerated and his body suddenly felt bloated.\nLeonel split his mind in two directions, both focusing in on his kidneys.\nLeonel had calculated everything out. If he tried to form his Nodes one at a time, he would get stone walled when he tried to form his Tenth. The only chance he stood was to form them both at the very same time.\nFor the current Leonel, splitting his mind in two directions was as easy as breathing. After Crystallizing his Spirit Pressure to perfection, he could already split it over eight ways. So, how could two possibly be an issue?\nLeonel guides his Force, stimulating his life energies, rearranging the cells of kidneys.\nThe kidney was an extraordinarily important part of the body. It was responsible for cleaning away many of the impurities of the blood. However, for anyone who had ever suffered a kidney stone before, they would know that even the smallest particle could cause everything to go wrong.\nFor Leonel to rearrange his cells, though it wasn't as dangerous as when he had done so with his brain, the immediate pain was definitely far more potent.\nHowever, from the outside, one would never guess that Leonel was in pain.\nIn just an hour, Leonel had already rearranged a hundred cells worth of space, creating a nice pocket for his two Nodes. To this point, despite the pain, everything had gone perfectly. All he had to do now was form his Node within the pockets he had created and connect them with his others. By then, his foundation within the Third Dimension would become perfect.\nLeonel's chest expanded, his thick Force building.\nIn one swift motion, he unhesitatingly swung his head back and gulped down the whole vial of dew.\nBANG!\nLeonel's body suddenly expanded by a size. However, it wasn't proportional in the slightest. He looked as though he had suddenly gained a hundred pounds and that his body would burst at any moment.\nHowever, under the strength of his Metal Body, he kept himself together as his face contorted.\nBlood leaked from his lips, but he willed himself to focus.\nIn that instant, all the Force in his body rushed to two locations, carving out a Node Pathway with impunity.\nLeonel's brow trembled, but he bit down on his teeth hard.\nHe compressed his bloated body, squeezing his muscles and flexing with all his might.\nCracks began to spread not only across himself, but even the floors of the Lab Setting. It seemed that he might implode at any given moment.\nBut it was exactly then that he felt the Node Pathways complete. One to his left kidney and the other two his right.\nJust when Leonel was about to feel ecstatic, he suddenly felt as though someone had stabbed through the right side of his body and twisted the knife.\nIn that moment, a scar Leonel had hardly thought about his whole life suddenly lit on fire. From a faint mark near his liver, it suddenly exploded, radiating out with a blinding light.\n\"AGH!\"\nLeonel couldn't control his roar. The pain was so excruciating that his eyes rolled back until only their whites remained. His body convulsed uncontrollably.\nThere was no need to even mention his breakthrough attempt. He had completely lost control of his Force, his body bursting apart at its seams.\nHe flopped to the ground, his body spasming as blood leaked from his orifices. The scar continued to burn brighter and brighter, stretching up the side of his body as though to swallow him whole.\nLeonel could have never thought that the reason he felt nine Nodes weren't enough was precisely because of this scar his father mentioned in the note he left to him all that time ago…",

      "content": "Leonel felt as though a blade was twisting through his organs. He had never experienced pain on this level in his entire life. It was to the point that no amount of will could keep his mind clear. Whatever semblance of control he had had over the process of his body had completely collapsed, resulting in a rampaging Force surging throughout his body.\nAnyone else in this sort of situation would have long since died. In fact, they moment they swallowed that amount of dew, they would have exploded on the spot.\nThat said, Leonel current situation had little to nothing to do with the amount of Force he had swallowed. In fact, it had nothing to do with him trying to form a Tenth Node either. It was entirely related to the twisting pain at his hip.\nTo this point, Leonel still had no idea why his father ever mentioned the scar above his hip. Leonel had never been aware of where it came from. Considering he played football, he had never thought much about it to begin with. Injuries always seemed to pop up randomly for anyone who played the sport. He had even broken his ribs during the last game he played, why would he think so much about a barely visible scar?\nHowever, Leonel could have never imagined that such a small matter would blow up to this level.\nLeonel's mind was completely blank. His eyes had rolled back, making his vision completely black. It felt as though the only thing he could feel was pain, the only think he could hear were his screams, the only thing he could smell was the metallic stench of his own blood.\nThen, it all began to turn faint. As though his life was being pulled along by a string completely out of his control, he stalked closer toward death. And, maybe the worst part was that Leonel wasn't even aware.\nMaybe it was because his will wasn't tempered enough, maybe it was because this pain was truly beyond the limits of his body, but there was nothing he could do to change his own fate.\n**\nAs Leonel was straddling the line of life and death, Scithe had finally gotten the report he had been waiting several days for. After reading it, he furrowed his brow.\nWith the level of their organization, digging up information on a mere Third Dimensional existence was too easy. However, Leonel's information was too weird.\nFor one, his grandfather was the Emperor of his world.\nHaving a world unified beneath one force was incredibly rare to begin with. It was an extraordinary feat and it was impossible for any simple existence to accomplish this, especially when it was a world with so much talent like Earth.\nThis alone wasn't enough to cause Scithe to frown. Who cared about the Emperor of a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional world? He might find it troublesome if Earth was a Pseudo Fifth Dimensional world, but they were very clearly far from this.\nWhat made him raise an eyebrow wasn't the information, but rather, the lack of it.\nFirstly, there wasn't a single hint of information about Leonel's maternal grandmother and Emperor Fawkes' wife. It was to the point they hadn't even managed to find her name. No birth records, no name, no death certificate… nothing.\nAs though that wasn't enough, his mother had vanished off the face of the planet. She hadn't been heard of in decades. In fact, the time she had disappeared for far outstripped Leonel's own age which was more than enough to raise some eyebrows.\nThen, there was Leonel's father. Rather than vanishing, the issue with him was that he appeared out of nowhere. There were records that were very clearly forged of his birth and early life, but it was all too simple for Scithe's organization to find out how fake these things were.\nOn top of that, he suddenly vanished after the Metamorphosis began. There wasn't a single record of him, nothing.\nEven this aside, there was Leonel himself.\nTo summarize the boy as a troublemaker was an understatement.\nThe near destruction of a Fort, the murder of several hidden family members, the falling out with the rebels of Earth…\nOf course, none of these things were enough to move Scithe. What did he care what a teen did against such weak organizations? The real issue was how all of this fit together.\nThere were a lot of organizations eyeing Earth right now. In fact, even without the mission he was given, Scithe already had Earth on his radar. This was simply one of those things the public was in the dark about while those with some real weight to them were already taking advantage of.\nWhat Scithe wanted to know was whether or not Leonel and his mysterious family was part of those eyeing Earth as a pie they wanted a slice of…\nIf this was the case, then Scithe might very well become a scapegoat in a power struggle simply by virtue of the fact he was unlucky enough to be saddled with this mission…\nThinking to this point, Scithe' sunken eyes narrows, his already pale features growing a shade whiter. When he entered such deep thought, his blood seemed to slow by a measure, making him appear to be even more ghost-like.\n'No matter what actions I take now, they have to be done with the utmost secrecy…'\nScithe knew that he didn't have the option to reject this mission. This was simply the plight of the weak. However, he also knew that his organization wouldn't throw him out to dry either. If they set such a precedent, it wouldn't be long before no one was willing to work for them.\nThis ultimately meant that he needed to set a seed of appropriate amounts of doubt. As long as there wasn't conclusive evidence that he was the one who acted, he should be able to keep a certain level of protection for himself.\n\"Where is he now.\"\nScithe finally turned the attendant who still knelt on the ground.\n\"From our information, he has long since left Earth using a teleportation ticket. But, since these tickets can only teleport someone within a quadrant, there were only about 200 worlds he could have gone to. After looking through the teleportation records of them all, there are 5 worlds that fit the timing and only one registered to Leonel Morales. He should be on Terrain, coordinate xx.xx.xx, at the moment.\"\nScithe nodded. \"Prepare everything. I want to leave within the hour.\"\n\"Yes!\"",

      "content": "Scithe landed on the teleportation platform.\nInstead of looking around toward his surroundings, he frowned for a moment and closed his eyes, slowly regaining his bearing.\nDespite the fact this was a private teleportation pad in the most secretive location the organization had to offer, there were already two individuals ready to receive Scithe. Neither said a word as Scithe regained his bearings and neither did Scithe acknowledge them.\nHad Leonel been there, he would have immediately recognized these two as the very same male and female pair that had branded him with the mark that now hovered over his forehead.\nWhen Scithe finally opened his eyes, the two of them stepped forward.\n\"Officer Fin greets Commander.\"\n\"Officer Thorn greets Commander.\"\nScithe looked toward the two of them indifferently.\nThe title of 'Officer' was just another way of saying unranked in their organization, while these 'Officers' all referred to those above them as Commander. It was similar to how some cultures called even those unrelated to them 'Uncle' or 'Big Brother', but in this case, rather than being a polite address, it was a way of drawing a line between true members of the organization and those who weren't worthy.\n\"I received information that a certain Leonel Morales came through this city. You have ten minutes to get me information about his whereabouts and other pertinent information. You may leave.\"\nFin and Thorn froze, looking toward each other with their heads still bowed.\nScithe frowned. \"What?\"\nHe could clearly see that there was something wrong.\nThe male officer, Fin, looked up carefully and explained everything from start to finish.\n\"… The most recent information we have of him is that he has left the city. If Commander wants, we can use the monitoring brand to retrieve him.\"\nThe truth was that these two Officers hadn't put much stock in Leonel. Though they branded him, that was a matter of convenience rather than necessity. They knew well that the matter was an inconvenience to Leonel and also knew that it was unnecessary to go so far, but so what? Who cared how Leonel felt about it?\nNever could they have expected that someone like Scithe would personally descend for someone they put no importance on.\nWhen Scithe heard the story, his frown couldn't help but deepen.\nNow, this matter he had been hoping to keep under wraps was likely the talk of much of the city.\nThis alone might have been fine, but the real problem was that now Leonel's conflict with their organization was public. There was no getting rid of this stain.\nEven if there was no direct evidence, if Leonel's mysterious backing was strong enough, they might not give a damn and kill those responsible anyway. This was the kind of power true strength could give someone.\nScithe's frown deepened, causing Thorn and Fin to break out into a cold sweat, even the usually expressionless Thorn couldn't help but tremble.\nAfter a while, Scithe's frown smoothed out.\nSince others could use him as a scapegoat, why couldn't he do the same? Who said he had to get directly involved?\nIt was already a problem that he had come here personally. But, there was good news as well.\nFor one, he had come through a private port. Secondly, because he was trying to be secretive to begin with, these two were the only ones who knew about his arrival. And, coincidentally, these two were the only ones with direct contact and interaction with Leonel as well. This made things as perfect and watertight as they could be.\n\"Good.\" Scithe suddenly spoke. \"Make sure to monitor him closely, very closely. Should he show any signs of stepping out of line, don't hesitate to punish him according to the law.\n\"I will be doing an inspection on this branch for the next while. Do as you usually do.\"\nWith that, Scithe walked by the two officers and disappeared down the corridor, leaving the two of them stunned.\nThey weren't sure how they were supposed to take this information. Was there a hidden meaning? Were they supposed to take it at face value?\n\"What… what do we do…\" Fin's confident sneer was nowhere to be seen. He looked more like a wounded pup who had been abandoned by his owner.\n\"…\"\nThorn remained silent for a long while. Clearly, she too was confused. In the end, she spoke hesitantly.\n\"This may be a test… The first thing Commander asked about when he came to was about this Leonel character. It's clear that his goal in coming here was related to this young man. But, he became apprehensive after hearing we already had dealings with him.\n\"On top of that, Commander came through the private pad only used in special circumstances… It's obvious that Commander wants to use us as scapegoats… It's clear that this Leonel's background isn't as simple as we once thought.\"\nFin shivered at these words. It seemed that he too had already thought of this, it was just that he didn't want to believe it.\n\"But… This is still an opportunity.\" Thorn said slowly. \"If we can kill this Leonel secretly, or manage to kill him in an above board manner without bending or violating any rules, I think there's a chance we can turn this disaster into a chance to rise up the ranks.\"\nFin clenched his jaw. \"It's already impossible to kill him secretly. The only chance is to use the latter option.\"\n\"… Agreed.\"\nThe only question was… how could they manipulate this Leonel into making a mistake worth his life?\nDeep within the corridor, Scithe, who the two thought had already left, curled his lip. It seems he was quite satisfied with the conclusion the two officers had come to.\nWith that, he turned and truly walked away completely.\n'This is still interesting, though...' Scithe thought to himself. 'This branch seems to be on high alert for fugitives, but why be on alert to the point of coincidentally arresting a Third DImensional ant?'\nIt was quite the coincidence indeed. Their organization had two conflicts with Leonel, neither related to the other. It seemed that there was something interesting going on in this quadrant.\nSince he was here, he might as well dip a toe in and profit as well.\n**\nWhat the two officers and Scithe had no idea about was that as they were speaking, the young man they were plotting the death of was already at death's door.\nLeonel lied convulsing in a pool of his own blood.\nBy now, Little Tolly was hopping around anxiously, but the little guy had no idea what to do.\nThe scar along Leonel side seemed to be growing more and more vicious with each passing moment. From afar, it looked as though Leonel was boiling from the inside out. The scar was like a burning hot coal, shining with a blazing red-orange light.\nIt was as that moment that an already terrible situation seemed to get worse.\nThe scar finally stopped growing and began to rapidly shrink. But, with this shrinkage came a violent suction energy. Not only was Leonel's own blood suddenly swallowed from around him, but the vitality within his body was being rapidly drained.\nSoon, Leonel went from a human that was bursting at the seams to a skeleton without an ounce of meat left on his body.\nHis eyes sunk in, their whites flickering about wildly.. He looked like he was truly at his end.",

      "content": "Leonel's skin pressed flush against his bone. Soon, it began to crackle and dry like a thin piece of paper. It even seemed like it just might crack like fine glass and perish into a pile of ash at any moment.\nIt was only then that something changed..\nBADDUM! BADDUM!\nLeonel's chest jolted so violently that it seemed like his heart might leap from his chest. The outline of his ribs were so clear in his current state that it was even vaguely possible to see the sudden activity.\nHis convulsing body shook once more. This time, a projectile of black blood shot out from his mouth as a familiar heat spread all through Leonel's body.\nIf Leonel was conscious, his mind would flash back to the days he spent with his father and a disgusting green smoothie he had to force down his throat everyday.\nLeonel had believed that he already understood the purpose of his father's concoctions. They had helped his body strengthen faster than others after the Metamorphosis despite the fact he wasn't born with an offensive or physical ability. Yet, he could have never thought that these benefits were just mere lingering aftereffects. They couldn't even represent a single percent of what their true strength was.\nAt that moment, three things began to occur in Leonel's body at once.\nIn his left kidney, a large Force Node of 100 cells had connected with the rest of his body and began to shimmer in full force.\nIn his Ethereal Glabella, a sudden surge of Soul Force began to spin violently around itself, quickly forming a Third Star that sent pulses of pure energy outward.\nAnd… In his right kidney, a golden-red stone began to form. No… It was more accurate to say that it had begun to reform. And, it was much larger than any one of Leonel's other Nodes. In fact, it didn't seem like a normal Node at all.\nLeonel hadn't realized it before, but a portion of his kidney had been cut out. But, it had been such a small portion that even when he swept his Internal Sight over it, he hadn't noticed a thing. It could be said that it only took up the space of a few thousand cells.\nHowever, at this moment, not only was the space that had been cut out suddenly filled with a heavy, swirling golden-red energy, but it slowly matured, taking over the whole of Leonel's right kidney until it completely morphed.\nIn a process that took several days, Leonel's right kidney turned from a normal organ of flesh and blood to a gem shimmering of gold and scarlet.\nIt was clear that whatever had been cut out of Leonel had not only recovered, but it had also strengthened by countless times compared to the past. But, what was most shocking was the fact it took the place of Leonel's Tenth Node, but was very clearly several times larger than his other Nodes.\nThe kidney might not have been a particularly large organ, but it was still formed of hundreds of thousands to millions of cells. Compared to the 100 cells that formed Leonel's other Nodes, there wasn't even an appropriate comparison.\nIn addition, compared to the Force that usually swirled about Leonel's Nodes and Nodal Pathways, this energy was several levels above anything Leonel had ever come into contact with before.\nIt seemed that Leonel's father had gone a bit overboard in helping his son to recover. By normal convention, Leonel would have eventually helped his kidney mature to this state over a long period of time, but it seemed like this would no longer be necessary.\nAt that moment, the violent changes to Leonel's body slowly came to a stop.\nAs his Three Star Constitution completed, a surge of black, putrid liquid flowed out from his pores and mouth, filling the Lab Setting with a terrible stench. At the same time, the golden-red energy of his right kidney seemed to connect with the rest of his body, causing a purification affect that even managed to match the formation of Leonel's Third Star in a casual manner. And, finally, Leonel's body, after going through so much, broke through another barrier and entered the Superior Stage.\nIt was within his body that the most drastic changes began to occur. Whether by design or coincidence, the golden-red energy of Leonel's kidney seemed to resonate with the residual red energy of his Runes.\nBack when Leonel had almost failed and suffered Bloodline Deviation he had managed to turn back in the end, but that experience still left a small influence on him. This was why instead of a pure violet, when he entered his true battle state, his eyes would also contain a tinge of red.\nThis redness seemed to be beloved by the energy of Leonel's kidney and they became attracted to one another. Soon, the slight redness of Leonel's Runes became more pronounced. At the same time, the bronze color grew in luster and tended slightly more toward gold.\nThe changes weren't escaped by Leonel's hair which also became more gold as it actually managed to survive the formation of his Third Star this time around.\nBut, maybe the greatest changes occurred in Leonel's Ethereal Glabella. At that moment, the faint spirit of his Snowy Star Owl seemed to also be influenced. In fact, compared to Leonel's Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, it resonated with this scarlet gold energy on a much deeper level even to the point of causing faint changes within the 12-Sided Star…\nAs all these changes continued to take place, Leonel remained in a deep sleep. During that time, the spirit of the Segmented Cube seemed to not like the fact its insides had been so dirtied. So, Leonel was swept up and thrust into the bath house of the Abode Setting while the mess he left behind was cleaned…\n**\nLeonel suddenly gasped awake, his hands erratically touching around his own body as though to make sure it was all still there. It was only then he sighed a breath of relief and realized he had somehow ended up in bed.\n'Did I fail?'\nLeonel sighed. Even if he failed, he thought himself lucky. After all, surviving in such a situation was likely borderline impossible.\n'Hold on…'\nLeonel frowned.\nIf he had failed, why was he uninjured? Could it be that he had only managed to form one Node? That was worse than failing all together because that meant he had no chance of forming his Tenth now…\nLeonel couldn't help but feel a bit down.\nHe sat up, crossing his legs and sinking into meditation. He might as well check the state of his body. He had always known that this was a nearly impossible endeavor, but for whatever reason, he had never even considered failure.\n\"… Huh?\"",

      "content": "The first thing Leonel noticed was that his Force was somewhat tinged with red. At first, he thought that this was a product of forming his Third Star. But, when he checked on the situation of his kidneys, he was left speechless.\nIt became very obvious, very quickly, that the reddish gold energy was coming from his right kidney which shimmered like a gem within his body.\n'What the hell…'\nLeonel's hand suddenly shot toward his scar, his gaze flashing with an imperceptible light.\nThe truth was that Leonel had never thought much about his scar. He had learned about it from his father's note, but that had been before he even stepped into the Mayan Tomb. By the time he went through so many life and death situations and got his hands on the dictionary – something he could finally use to find out more about it – it wasn't even on his mind any longer. As a result, Leonel never got around to asking…\n'Innate Force Node…?'\nWhen Leonel's mind landed on these words, he was suddenly jolted out of his stupor.\nHe remembered that the first time he learned about Innate Force Nodes he had been reading [Dimensional Cleanse]. The creator had mentioned them and even said that created Force Nodes were no weaker.\nBut, looking at his right kidney, Leonel had a hard time imagining that his self-created Force Nodes could match up. Whether it was in size, quality or robustness, his right kidney far outstripped anything he had ever come across. In fact, it was an even higher quality than his Light Elemental Force which was an exceptionally high-level energy to begin with!\nLeonel frowned.\nDid this scar mean that someone had planted this Force Node into him? But why had he not noticed it until now? And what was with it being so large? Are all Innate Force Nodes this large?\nLeonel reached out with his Internal Strength and tried to communicate with his right kidney's Node.\n\"AGH!\"\nA searing pain suddenly shot through Leonel's body. Just a wisp of the Force made him feel as though his body would burn to ash if he continued for even a split second more.\nLeonel broke out into a cold sweat, collapsing.\nWhat the hell? He couldn't even use his own Innate Force Node? What kind of joke was this?\nLeonel had no idea that he had reawakened his Innate Force Node much earlier than his father had expected.\nLeonel wasn't supposed to try and form a Tenth Node. That was simply suicidal. The fact he tried at all was enough for people to look at him as though he was a madman.\nUnfortunately, or maybe fortunately depending on the perspective, his actions catalyzed the rebirth of his Innate Force Node. But, it also made it far more powerful than he was prepared to deal with.\nLeonel gave up, taking out the dictionary. He really had no idea what was happening.\n\"What is going on?\"\nLeonel couldn't even come up with pointed questions, he could only ask this. Ever since he left the turbulence of Camelot, the dictionary had begun to work just fine once again.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ … ]\nAfter a long while of listening and many more specific questions, Leonel came to understand…\nHis Innate Force Node hadn't been planted into him. In fact, it was the exact opposite. Someone had operated on him as a child and taken it out.\nWhen Leonel wanted to find out more about this, the dictionary practically cut him out. The only understanding he managed to grasp was that it wasn't his father's family that had done so and even that was only done through various deductions.\nStill, in the end, the Innate Force Node was Leonel's to begin with, it was written into his very being. It just needed a catalyst to rebirth itself. In the end, that catalyst came much earlier than anyone could have ever expected.\nFinally, Leonel learned about just what this energy was.\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Scarlet Star Force ]\nLeonel, who was still in a bit of a bad mood after learning he had been operated on without his knowledge as a child, raised his eyebrows.\n\"What is that Force?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Replying to Seed, Scarlet Star Force is a mutated Light Elemental Force that has gained characteristics of Fire Elemental Force and Star Elemental Force. It's a balance of all three that creates an all new energy that ranks among the top of all three Elemental types. ]\n\"Oh? Where does it rank amongst the three?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[It ranks top ten of Star Elemental Forces. It ranks top three within Light Elemental Forces. It ranks number one within Fire Elemental Forces.]\nLeonel was shocked. This was the first time the dictionary had given him such a definitive answer about the strength of something. The fact its answer was so decisive and clear made Leonel realize that his Scarlet Star Force was likely something beyond his imagining.\nAfter taking several deep breaths to calm himself, Leonel asked the final question he had on his mind.\n\"What abilities is Scarlet Star Force known for?\"\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Destruction. ]\nLeonel plopped down on his bed, a hint of shock playing his features.\nIt was a clean, direct, and unconfusing answer. It couldn't have been more forcefully outlined. And, Leonel believed it with his very being.\nHis Scarlet Star Force wasn't as simple as causing damage with oppressive heat or strong power, Leonel quite literally felt his cells quake whenever he observed the energy as though they didn't even want to live anymore.\nThis level of Force… this quality of energy… it held a mystery to it that was far beyond what the current Leonel could grasp. Even after just observing it for a moment, Leonel felt as though shackles within his mind were loosening and the feeling was just as profound as the Fourth Dimensional Force Art within his Dream World.\nThe only exception was that this Scarlet Star Force was only trying to teach him one thing instead of a myriad of things…\nHow to destroy!\nJust when Leonel wanted to experiment to see what his true limits were, he froze, his gaze shooting up to the ceiling of his room.\nSomeone was above him…",

      "content": "\"What is it, Uncle Zimo? Why did we stop?\"\nThe voice of a young lady came out from the midst of an escort. In fact, it wasn't just any young lady, but rather Syl, the friend of the woman who was the cause of Leonel's current predicament, but also, ironically maybe the reason Leonel was still alive.\nThe escort was quite long, containing at least 50 individuals. Aside from one large chariot which Syl's voice came from, the rest road odd war horses with twin horns and an underbelly covered in thick scales.\nUncle Zimo was the very same older man with sparse hair that had taken Syl away from Rie just days ago. But, at the moment, he stood in place at the head of the escort, his hands folded to his back and his gaze narrowed. The issue was that he seemed to be staring into empty space. Other than an unkempt road before him amidst a thick forest, there was nothing else.\nJust when everyone was beginning think Uncle Zimo had gone crazy, the ground trembled slightly and a young man slowly appeared.\nFor a moment, it seemed as though the whole of the world revolved around him.\nThe young man wore heavy leather robes that exuded the wild air of a beast. His hair, shimmering of gold and bronze swayed slightly beneath the wind, accentuating his sharp, handsome features.\nThough his eyes were colored a dull green, they held a hidden sharpness within them that remained calm even in the face of such a large group.\nIt was clear that this young man was still in the Third Dimension. Anyone with Internal Sight could see the faint rejection of the world around him. Yet, somehow, the pressure he exuded was so far beyond that.\nUncle Zimo's gaze narrowed.\n\"Is there a reason you called me out?\" Leonel questioned.\nDespite the numerous eyes on him, his voice was steady and calm. However, it seemed to break an illusion everyone had just been under.\nWhether it was by coincidence or design, the aura of the previous Leonel had made everyone ignore a few things. For one, no one had noticed the little mink around his neck until now. And, most importantly… no one had noticed the black mark that hovered before his forehead until now as well.\nUpon realizing this, Uncle Zimo's expression became more hostile than it already was, causing Leonel to frown.\nLeonel was getting really tired of people being hostile to him just because of this mark on his forehead. He had even left the city, only for this nonsense to happen anyway.\nThe worst part was that Leonel was certain that he was no match for this man. He didn't know enough about the Fourth Dimension to properly measure this man's stats, but all he needed to know was that this Uncle Zimo was far stronger than his previous self. As for how his current self would stack up… Leonel had no idea, he hadn't even had a chance to measure his limits.\nUncle Zimo took a step forward, causing Leonel's furrowed brows to darken.\n\"I suggest you watch yourself. I'm not in the greatest of moods.\" Leonel said coldy. \"If you insist on attacking me without reason, I'll ensure that your whole escort is swarmed by beasts and Invalids.\"\nLeonel's sudden words stunned Uncle Zimo. Maybe he had never expected someone within the Third Dimension to speak to him like this. Thee weren't many even within the Fourth Dimension who dared to say such words.\nHowever, Leonel was clearly not in the mood to mind his feelings.\nFirst, he was branded like a slave. Then he was forced out of the city without a place to sleep. Then he almost died during his breakthrough, only to find out that someone had snatched something that was his as a child. Even though he had gotten it back now, with Leonel's personality, he was still more than just a little pissed.\nAnd now, instead of crossing over him without a word, this damned old man stopped the whole escort just to bring him out from the ground and suddenly wanted to target him for something that wasn't his fault?\nLeonel found that his patience for nonsense was getting shorter and shorter as time passed. The longer he spent in this new world order, the more his charismatic, easy going self was whittled away.\nUncle Zimo's shocked appearance suddenly gave way to a sneer and then laughter. It wasn't just him, many of the soldiers and warriors within the escort couldn't hold it in any longer.\nYet, Leonel didn't seem to have heard their mocking chuckling.\nHe flipped his palm over, a deep black bow appearing in his hand. Even the sun that peaked through the heavy foliage above could only be wholly absorbed by its surface.\nThe little mink on Leonel's shoulder bared its little fangs, growling.\nLeonel's aura seemed to change once more, sharpening. A slightly cold wind circled around him, causing the dried leaves at his feet to swirl about.\nHe casually nocked an arrow and faced the escort, his indifferent gaze locking onto Zimo.\nIt was clear in an instant that he wasn't joking in the slightest. If this old man continued to piss him off, he really would do something.\nUncle Zimo stopped laughing and frowned.\n\"Do you really think any beasts would be attracted by your mere Third Dimensional Force? Do you think I would need my Fourth Dimensional Force to deal with you? Do you think this is a fairy tale?\"\nLeonel's gaze remained without expression. It was as though he hadn't heard Zimo's words at all.\nHis entire demeanor seemed to say 'try me'.\nHis own Third Dimensional Force wouldn't attract Invalids here, but what if he activated his Winter Four Seasons Realm comprehension? He had already reached the pinnacle of Crystallization, what if he broke into the Fourth Dimension with his Soul Force right here? And even if he ignored all of that, what about his Scarlet Star Force? Was there a beast or Invalid in the world that could withstand its temptation?\nAt this point, Leonel was truly daring Zimo to act. He would gladly bury this arrogant prick right here.\nAt the same time, Uncle Zimo was growing more and more pissed. A mere Third Dimensional ant actually dared to speak to him this way? The worst part was that he really didn't dare to call Leonel out on his bluff.\nEven if he truly believed Leonel was spewing nothing but nonsense, he had a responsibility to protect Zimo. Even if there was only a 1% chance, he was trained to not risk it.\nHis gaze turned hard as he stared down Leonel, but the latter met his gaze without a worry.\n\"It's you?\"\nSuddenly, a voice cut through the atmosphere.\nLeonel frowned. Not only did he recognize the voice, just hearing it made him more pissed than he already was.\nAt that moment, two women peeked out from the carriage, one of whom was Rie, the very woman who caused much of Leonel's troubles in this world.\nThe moment she spoke, Leonel's glare landed on her, causing her trouble breathing to come back several folds stronger. She nearly collapsed where she stood.\nUncle Zimo suddenly took a step forward, but…\nSHUUUUUUUUUU!\nHe had hardly moved when an arrow landed barely a centimeter before his foot.\nIn that instant, he froze. This wasn't because he felt the danger of the arrow. It was slow and for someone like him, dodging it would have been possible. The issue was that he hadn't even finished lifting his foot when the arrow landed before him right in the area he had wanted to step toward.\nThe awkward sudden stop shifted his momentum backward, causing an arrow that wouldn't have been lethal to him regardless to make him look ridiculous.\nLeonel's gaze left Rie and landed back on Uncle Zimo, his expression becoming even colder. Now that he knew this escort was led by that woman, his impression of them was even worse.\n\"Boy…\" Zimo's voice came out in a low growl.\n\"Uncle Zimo, stop.\" Syl's voice suddenly calmed the atmosphere once again. \"Young man, how about we have a chat?\"\nLeonel frowned and looked away from Zimo once again. What did this woman want?",

      "content": "Syl was a bit off put by Leonel's reaction. What young man wouldn't want to have a talk with a beauty like her? What was his issue?\nHowever, with her noble upbringing, it was impossible for such thoughts to cross her face. In fact, they were just fleeting thoughts of hers she didn't spend much time on to begin with.\n\"Did you not hear her?\"\nJust when Leonel was thinking of what he should be doing, a young man riding one of those odd war steeds glared toward Leonel. It was clear that he was very much unsatisfied with Leonel's attitude.\n'What the hell is wrong with these people?' Leonel almost couldn't refrain from rolling his eyes.\nIt was as though everyone who he met made it their duty to piss him off.\n\"If you want to speak with me, there's nothing wrong with the current arrangement. I would hate to get attacked again just for breathing the same air as you.\" Leonel said indifferently.\nSyl was even more stunned by these words, while? Zimo's expression darkened. As for the young man who spoke out, his hands slid to the sword by his side. It seemed that he too was losing his patience.\nNo one seemed to realize that Leonel's words were correct, even if they were somewhat rude.\nHe had just been dragged up from deep within the earth just because he happened to be along their way. Who knew what would happen if he actually accepted this advice? He didn't have a death wish.\nThe only reason Leonel set himself up so close to the road to begin with was because beasts tended to avoid the human population so they would be less likely to be near where humans frequented. But, he didn't expect this logical choice to land him in trouble.\nRie stomped her feet. \"He's so rude, Syl. Just get Uncle Zimo to beat him up so we can leave.\"\nLeonel's gaze swept over Rie once more, causing the rest of her words to get caught in her throat. Whatever she meant to say came out in a whimper, dying in her chest.\nSyl comforted Rie for a moment before peeking back through the window of the carriage.\nShe observed Leonel for a long while. She couldn't help but be curious, plus, she felt a bit guilty. She had happened to overhear some of the things Leonel had suffered through in the city thanks to the actions of her friend. The fact he was hostile wasn't too much of a surprise. It could even be said it was partly her fault for giving Rie an inside path toward a job she wasn't qualified for.\n\"I…\" Syl hesitated. \"… I'm in need of a guard. The pay is quite good, if you're interested.\"\nZimo's expression changed. Guard? What better guard was there than him? Even if he failed, there were still 50 others. And, even if those 50 failed, there were still the hand selected youths for this important event. And, even if by some act of a god all of this failed, there were still the life saving measures she had as the young miss of a preeminent family.\nWhat need did she have for a Third Dimensional guard?\nThe young man riding the war horse by Syl's carriage carried the worst expression. How did asking for a new guard reflect on himself?\nBut, Leonel's words made it all worse.\n\"I have no interest in being a bodyguard. I only want to leave this place without being targeted.\" Leonel said plainly.\nThough he was in need of an organization to gain information from, Leonel had no interest in this nonsense. He had to figure out a way to find Aina or at least get her to find him and joining a group with so much clear hostility toward him was the last thing he wanted to do.\nSyl was once again stumped. She tried to be nice, but if Leonel didn't want it, there was no way for her to force him to accept her kindness.\nOf course, if Leonel knew her thoughts, he would think she thought too much of herself. It was an act of kindness for him to act as her guard? Compared to those here, even if his physical strength couldn't match up, his Internal Sight was most definitely unmatched. His ability to keep her safe by avoiding danger alone would be better than everyone here.\nEven if it wasn't about his Internal Sight, Leonel was starting to get a better and better understanding of his talent and how it matched up to others the longer he spent in this new world order. Maybe in a time as short as a month, Syl wouldn't have the face to ask him for such a thing.\nAfter a moment of being flustered, Syl still didn't know how to respond. It was then that something no one could have expected to happen, happened.\n\"Zilar, your quota is revoked. Young man, I would like for you to take his place in representing out Keafir family, what do you think?\"\nThe young man riding the odd, scaled war horse froze. All the animosity and hatred he had on his face was suddenly washed away by despair.\nThe delicate voice sounded from within the carriage. Though Leonel couldn't see who had spoken, he felt as though her words manifested into a painting of her image. It was gorgeous, pure and flawless, riding the cool wind like a fragrant breeze.\nLeonel didn't know why, but he was compelled to say yes almost immediately.\nHowever, everyone else was shocked beyond belief. Let alone Zilar, even Syl who had wanted to take Leonel as a body guard and Zimo who had wanted to kill Leonel just moment ago stood frozen.\nLeonel might not have known who had just spoken, but they knew well who it was.\nShe was none other than the future Matriarch of the family, the woman both Rie and Syl called sister-in-law and the wife of Syl's only elder brother – Mistress Heira.\nCompared to Syl, the word of this woman was practically law. Since she had spoken, things were practically final. It was to the point where even if Leonel wanted to run, Zimo wouldn't allow him to. In fact, it was to the point that any hostility Zimo had toward Leonel could only be buried deep within his heart.\nRealizing the sudden change in the atmosphere, Leonel seemed to understand that turning this 'offer' down wasn't an option.\nBut, what was this quota this woman spoke of? What mess had he been thrust into this time?",

      "content": "Leonel sat in the carriage completely expressionless as though he couldn't sense the numerous glares coming at him from the outside.\nThe truth was that if he was a bit less thick skinned, he would be embarrassed as well. He was currently the only man within the carriage and the reason for this was quite embarrassing as well.\n… He really hated riding horses.\nLeonel sat in a corner to himself, ignoring the fragrance that hung in the air. He had never been very moved by such things to begin with. Even the beautiful Mistress Heira only caught his attention for a moment before he didn't glance her way again.\nIndeed, she was quite beautiful. In fact, it seemed that Leonel would meet a new most beautiful woman he had ever seen every other month. It was as though they all grew on trees and were being picked for him in terms of quality.\nBut, Leonel knew that the truth was that the more powerful the woman, the more beautiful they seemed to be. This was likely just a matter of evolution.\nHeira, though, seemed to be particularly fairy-like.\nA head of flowing white hair, two crystal-like, shimmering blue eyes, a delicately sculpted nose… Everything down from the slight blush of her cheeks to the slenderness of her fingers were all perfectly sculpted to enrapture a man.\nIt somehow made Leonel think of Aina, not for their similarities, but for their differences.\nLeonel's memory of Aina wasn't as beautiful. In fact, even when Aina wore dresses and portrayed the image of a shy, reserved lady, he had always noticed her tanned skin.\nOf course, on Earth, women took tanning as a trend, at least in the western parts of the world. This was a trend that held strong from the 21st century even to this current point.\nBut, Leonel knew that Aina wasn't the type of person to artificially tan herself or lounge out in the sun. Subconsciously, he always knew that her tan must have come from something else. In fact, it was precisely because of Aina's tan that Leonel first became interested in her and his curiosity eventually got the best of him.\nLost in thought, Leonel suddenly smiled. It seemed he missed her quite a lot. He longed to fight side by side with her again.\nThose warriors who caught sight of Leonel's smile through the window were stunned before feeling furious again, especially when they saw that Rie and Syl had entered somewhat of a daze.\nLeonel didn't seem to notice the reactions of the others around him as he closed his eyes, entering a state of meditation as he allowed the little mink to cuddle in his arms. At that moment, it seemed as though the air around him had subtly changed.\nThough he wanted to ask about what he had just gotten himself into, since Mistress Heira hadn't said a word, he could only remain silent as well. With his Dream World, he could still improve himself without moving an inch.\nAs Leonel fell into meditation, Rie looked somewhat jealously toward the little mink in his arms, causing Syl to giggle.\n\"For someone who claims to be scared of him, you sure interact with him a lot.\" She said teasingly.\nRie pouted. \"I just wanted to pet it, why couldn't I just pet it?\"\nLittle Blackstar opened one of its eyes to look at Rie before closing it and ignoring her once again. This disregard almost made her stamp her foot in rage.\nHeira remained silent throughout the antics of the two girls, sending a curious gaze toward Leonel.\n'Interesting…' She thought, smiling to herself.\n…\nLeonel's mind fully entered his Dream World. At the moment, he could split his mind nine ways, so he put one to the task of monitoring the surroundings of his main body while the rest immersed themselves.\n'I've mastered 300 spears to now… If I want to completely grasp the Chain Domain, I still have 1700 more to go…'\nLeonel sighed, it took him months to reach that 300 or so spear mark. It would probably take him years to finish comprehending just a singular spear domain, yet that wasn't even a single percent of the spears within the Spear Domain ring.\n'If only I could breakthrough now…'\nLeonel knew that his ability was directly tied to his Soul Force. If he broke through to the Fourth Dimension with it, his ability would definitely evolve to an all new level. But, it was simply too dangerous to do this in the wilderness.\nThis was the real reason Leonel swallowed all of that dew in one go previously. He didn't want to risk running out of Force and having to pull from the atmosphere. If he did, he would have probably been swarmed and died.\nUnfortunately, he had no dew left. And, even if he did, the dew wasn't compatible with his Soul Force as it was normal Force. In addition, it was only of the Third Dimension, not the Fourth, so it was completely unhelpful.\nLeonel shook his head. If he hadn't been kicked out of the city, this wouldn't have been a problem. But, life wasn't fair.\n'Maybe I should just try to Dream Sculpt those Four Seasons Force Arts…?'\nLeonel rejected this idea immediately. He would need to bring them out from the snowglobes in order to do this. Someone as sharp as Heira would definitely see through their specialness. By then, it'd be a wonder if he could even keep them.\nLeonel wasn't foolish enough to simply believe Heira was a good person just because she was beautiful and had a pleasing voice.\n'Then it seems my only option is to focus on comprehending the changes to my body and comprehending more spears…'\nLeonel shook his head. There were really too many things limiting him.\n'Wait…'\nLeonel's gaze suddenly sharpened. He looked up toward the very top of his Dream World, locking eyes with a massive sphere of Force Arts.\nWith a thought, a spear manifested in Leonel's hands. It was adorned by feathers and seemed quite light to the touch. In addition, it was wildly flexible, waving about at the slightest movement of Leonel's wrist. It felt more like a loose string or a whip than a spear.\nThis was one of the spears that Leonel had yet to master.\nLeonel locked eyes with the spherical Force Art and suddenly brandished the spear. He instantly fell into a state of enlightenment.\nWhat he didn't know was that at the very instant he did, Heira's gaze suddenly shot open like an eagle. The air around Leonel had changed once again.\n'Auspicious Air…?'",

      "content": "Auspicious Air. Ancient Aura. Heavenly Enlightenment.\nIt went by many names across just as many worlds. But, regardless of what it was called, the rarity of it didn't change at all. Even the normally calm and unflustered Heira couldn't help but be shocked at this moment. It was to the point her eyes widened uncontrollably.\n\"Sist –\"\nHeira raised her slender finger to her pink lips, shushing Syl. It seemed that she was afraid of waking Leonel from such a rare state. It was clear that she had no idea that Leonel had entered this state by choice and it wasn't a mere rare chance… It was something beyond that.\nA few minutes later, the air around Leonel suddenly vanished and he woke up within his Dream World. At that moment, he too was stunned.\n'Three minutes… It took three minutes…'\nLeonel was shocked. Usually, it would take him a few hours to master a spear if he went all out.\nIn truth, this was already shockingly fast. If others came to know he could do this, there was no telling what kind of sensation it would cause.\nHowever, Leonel came to realize that as he climbed the hill, the more difficult it became and the more hours he had to pour in to master these spears. Before he realized it, a few months had passed and he had only mastered 300 or so of the over 2000 he needed to.\nBut, this took him only three minutes?!\nThe most shocking part was that he had only comprehended with one mind. What if he split his mind eight ways and reflected on the Force Art from eight different directions at once?\n…\nHeira sighed. 'It only lasted a few minutes, but that would be enough for him to meditate on for a lifetime. He's quite a lucky child --.'\nHeira almost choked. Leonel entered the state again.\nHer elegant demeanor was suddenly thrust out the window.\n…\nLeonel began to experiment. Would it be more efficient to comprehend numerous spells at once? Or meditate on the same spear? What about if he spent four mind splits on one spear and four on another? What if he spent two on each spear?\nLeonel exhausted all this options, hopping into and out of a state Heira thought was nearly impossible to touch in the first place. By the end of it all, she felt so numb that she may very well have been close to losing her mind.\nSyl and Rie watched this scene play out from the side, completely stunned. They didn't know what had happened to their elegant and refined sister-in-law to make her act like this.\nIn truth, Heira's reactions weren't very exaggerated. To other people, they could only be considered to be a slight reaction. Maybe a slight opening of her pink lips, a slight raise of her brows, a slight twitch at the corner of her eyes and lashes… However, for Heira, this was the equivalent of her jaw dropping to the floor.\nOf course, Leonel had no idea what these women were feeling. He wouldn't care even if he knew. After all, the Force Art was within his Dream World which was essentially just a projection of his memories in his mind. It was impossible for anyone to take from him.\n…\n'Is this his ability…?' Heira finally concluded.\nWhen Heira came to this conclusion, she sucked in a cold breath. She suddenly understood why Leonel would disdain to be a bodyguard.\nThough Heira had already seen through Leonel's potential, it seemed that even her own evaluation was too low. Someone with such an ability wouldn't be restricted by… anything!\nOf course, Heira was technically incorrect, but also could be considered to be correct in a way as well. Without his ability, it would truly be impossible for Leonel to do what he was doing now.\n'… If this is truly the case, we have picked up a treasure… But… This treasure will be difficult to control…'\nMistress Heira regained her calm. No matter how one looked, it had become impossible to read her thoughts from her expression.\n…\n'So that's how things are…'\nLeonel realized several things through countless experiments.\nFor one, it was far more efficient to split his mind and meditate on the same spear.\nFrom Leonel's trials, for a spear at the bottom of the hill, it took about a single minute to master while meditating on the Natural Force Art. For one nearer the middle, it took about five minutes. For one near the top, it took upwards of ten minutes.\nHowever, if he meditated on a spear with two minds at once, the time was lowered by a factor of three. A lower tier spear would take 20 seconds and so on…\nThe more minds Leonel used, the efficiency became greater and greater. Eventually, when he used all eight minds, it took him no more than a second or two for a lower tier spear and not even a third of a minute for a higher tier one.\nStill, even this wasn't the greatest realization Leonel had made.\nWhen he went back to the base of the Spear Peak in order to experiment with lower tier spears, he realized that masteries could be separated into tiers.\nLeonel personally chose to split masteries into two tiers. One, the lower, was what he called 'Shallow Mastery', while the higher was named 'Depth Mastery' by him.\nShallow Mastery was all Leonel had grasped until now. In order to evoke this mastery, he had to recall the memories and project the image of the spear consciousness outward. This was why whenever he battled with his spear, the images of the spear owners would pop up.\nHowever, when he reached Depth Mastery, this evocation was no longer necessary. It became ingrained into his very bones.\nIn order to reach Depth Mastery, the requirement was ten times the time.\nThis meant for a lower level spear, it would take about 20 seconds. For a middle level spear, it would around two minutes. For a higher tier spear, it would take around four to five minutes.\nBut for Leonel, this was well worth it because he realized that when he reached Depth Mastery…\nThe stamina it took him to use his Dreamscape Battle Sense plummeted!",

      "content": "Leonel lost track of the days, causing the ladies within the carriage to almost become worried.\nThis wasn't because they were worried for Leonel and it wasn't because they were worried about their own safety having to sleep in the same region as a man either. After all, with Mistress Heira here, even if Leonel had evil thoughts, whether or not he'd be able to keep his life for more than a few seconds was the real question in such a situation.\nWhat they were really worried about was cleanliness. They were very much worried that Leonel would ruin things with his presence. And, as though this wasn't bad enough, he hadn't moved in almost a week already.\nBut, as time passed, they began to realize something extraordinary. Despite not making any attempts to clean himself, Leonel actually didn't smell. In fact, he looked the exact same as he had when he began to meditate without a care in the world.\nNot only that, but he didn't even try to strike up a conversation with any one of them. It made sense for him to maintain distance from Heira. After all, considering how much Syl's elder brother doted on his wife, he might very well kill Leonel just for being in her presence like this. But what about Rie and Syl?\nThe two women began to feel that there was either something wrong with them, or something wrong with Leonel.\n\"Hm?\"\nLeonel's eyes suddenly shot open. A piercing gaze seemed to tear through the air before him as the faint light of a spear shot into the void.\nMistress Heira didn't miss this subtle change. But, before she needed to act, Leonel snuffed out the aura himself.\nLeonel sent his gaze out of the carriage window, finding an ever looming city quickly approaching. But, this city made the one he had landed in seem like a children's toy.\nIts walls were hundreds of meters tall, projecting an air of not only strength but also artistry.\nLeonel never thought that he'd be thinking such a thing about wall, but here he was.\nThe walls were a gentle gold color accented by a strong crimson red. Depictions of valiant warriors and magical beasts were etched across its surface, projecting a three dimensional landscape of war.\nJust staring at the images made Leonel feel as though the clanging of weapons and the roaring of beasts were reverberating in his mind. Yet, he couldn't take his eyes off of it.\nHe felt his blood boil, his eyes flickering on and off with a violet-red color that shrouded the carriage in an oppressive air.\nThis feeling… It was the very same feeling he had the first time he faced an army of demons.\nSyl and Rie shivered, inching away from Leonel while lamenting that the massive carriage was still too small.\nMistress Heira's gaze trembled. She too felt her heart palpitate.\nShe could tell that this was the first time Leonel was seeing these walls. Usually, it was impossible to become so immersed during a second or third attempt. In addition, most would miss the opportunity and look away after losing courage, not knowing they were leaving an opportunity of a lifetime behind.\nHeira could have never expected that Leonel would not only keep looking, but he had even awoken from his meditation as though he had sensed it calling out to him.\n\"… This has no business on a Fourth Dimensional World…\" Leonel suddenly mumbled.\nThe words were only meant for himself, but Heira's eyes widened when she managed to grasp them.\nIn the end, she smiled lightly. Though she did, with her demeanor, it was no more than the slightest curl of her lip.\n\"Leonel, you are quite patient. All this time, you haven't asked what it is you'll be participating in.\"\nLeonel blinked out of his thoughts and looked toward the future Matriarch of the Keafir family. This was the first time she had spoken with him since he entered this carriage.\n\"… I figured you'd tell me when it was time.\" Leonel finally replied.\nHeira's beautiful blue eyes fluttered. Then, without responding directly to the question, she looked toward the city in the distance.\n\"Do you know what that city represents?\"\n\"Bravery.\" Leonel said without hesitation.\nHeira seemed surprised by this answer before she smiled lightly. This time, her smile seemed much more obvious than it had been in the past.\n\"That's one answer.\" She said noncommittedly. \"My answer, though, is even simpler than that. It's Survival.\"\nLeonel's heart stilled for a moment. A flood of unknowable emotions surged through him, causing his blood to rumble once more.\n\"You say bravery because you have the strength to say as much. To those without power, it's never about something so idealistic. All they want to see is their next day, their next meal, their next breath. It's not about anything more than that.\"\nSyl's eyes glittered as she looked toward Leonel. Is this boy really powerful enough to gain such an evaluation from her sister-in-law?\nAs for the simplest among them all, Rie, she almost couldn't refrain from harrumphing. She clearly didn't like anything that praised Leonel. What powerful man would bully a young, beautiful girl like her? More pointedly, what powerful man would have such a slave brand?\nLeonel didn't respond to these words.\nThis wasn't the first time he had run into such a problem. His talk with Roaring Black Lion all those months ago still resurfaced in his memories from time to time.\n\"You could say that this is a matter of survival for our family. So, I hope that you'll treat this with the appropriate amount of seriousness.\"\nIt was only now Leonel realized that he was dealing with a mad woman.\nThis woman knew nothing about him. Yet, she directly snubbed a genius likely handpicked by their family in favor of him, a man branded with a mark that might as well have assigned him as a slave.\nIf she wasn't mad, then how else would you describe it?\nYet, Leonel couldn't help but find himself grinning.\nIf he couldn't find Aina, the next best option was to raise holy hell until she caught wind of him being here. If this place was really so important, wouldn't it be perfect for him?\nHe was beginning to think that Heira might have taken a liking to him because he too was a madman.",

      "content": "\"That's the Kaefir family's entourage!\"\nThe outside of the valiant city was bustling. It was not much different from the people of Earth meeting their celebrities.\nTo the common folk, a family that ruled of a City like Kaefir's was far beyond their reach. To see them in the flesh like this was an opportunity of a lifetime.\nThese people knew that they would never have the chance to enter Brave City. But they still traveled here from all over just to catch a glimpse of the festivities. The best part was that they could do so safely. No beasts or Invalids would dare to enter even the ten kilometer radius of Brave City. The aura around it was simply too oppressive. Thanks to this, it was often even safer to be here than it would be to stay at their homes…\n\"The Swan family escort is here!\"\nThe crowd boiled once again. What could excite the people more if not rivalry and competition?\nNot only were the Swan and Keafir family's both long standing enemies, but they also both had the strength to stand out amidst the crowd.\nTerrain had a system of Cities and Powers. They worked together to balance one another.\nWhile the Cities were ruled by City Lords, the Powers were ruled by Patriarchs and Matriarchs.\nOf course, there were divisions amongst Cities and within Powers. But, both Kaefir and Swan City were both the highest Tier 9 Cities. They stood at the helm of the world along with the strongest Powers. If not, they would never have teleportation hubs.\nThe warriors of the Swan and Kaefir families swept glances over one another, a haughty air exuding from them all. They seemed to toe a line of acknowledgement and indifference.\nBoth entourages came to a stop about half a kilometer from the looming city gates. Even as members of the escort, they were aware that they wouldn't be allowed to enter the city gates. Only the elites amongst the elite would be allowed to do such a thing.\nAt that moment, the crowd became entirely focused on the carriages near the middle of the entourage and the small group of elites around it. They all knew that the group of young men and women around the center and the elites within the carriage were the only ones that would be able to take the stage.\nAt that moment, Zilar's expression was gloomy as could be. He gripped the reins of his war horse so tightly that the imprint seeped into his skin and even became soaked with blood.\nThose who had gained a quota along with Zilar looked toward him with pitying gazes and couldn't help but push their hatred for Leonel up another notch.\nThis adulation should have been Zilar's. Yet, he wouldn't even get to participate? in something he had worked so hard for. How could he also not be enraged? But, in a world where power spoke over all, there was nothing he could do.\nMistress Heira was more powerful than he was, so her word was final. Nothing more, nothing less.\nAt that moment, the door to the Swan family's carriage opened.\nThe first to step out was a young woman. Her demeanor and elegance was a step below that of Mistress Heira. However, her looks were not in the least bit inferior.\nHer charm lay in her openness. She wore a modest blue dress that matched well with her deep black hair and fair complexion. A perpetual, inviting smile hung from her lips, capturing the hearts of all those who saw her.\nThe moment this young woman stepped out, eight youths riding war horses of their own stepped down from them, following to her back in an orderly fashion.\n\"Young Miss Swan…\"\nThe crowd seemed to be breathless for a moment.\nJust as the atmosphere was reaching its peak, the Keafir family carriage opened.\nSyl descended with a bright smile. She didn't look directly at the crowd, but it still felt as though she had greeted them all one by one. She was nothing like the flustered young lady who didn't know how to respond to Leonel's bluntness and played every bit the part of elegant noble woman.\nHer charisma was no less than Young Miss Swan. In fact, since she picked up some tips from her own sister-in-law, her own demeanor was even slightly more refined than the latter.\nHowever, it was at that instant that something no one could have possibly expected to happen occurred.\nAnother person stepped out from the carriage, but his appearance came with what sounded like the shattering of countless hearts.\nThe moment the young man appeared, it was as though a spear had suddenly been brandished before the world. A sharpening blade resonated in the ears of all those who saw him, causing the air to grow several times heavier.\nThe young man's almost golden hair swayed gently beneath his billowing aura, a faint violet hue collecting around him like a cloud. It felt as though his immediate surroundings had become his inescapable domain, a place he controlled all to his own.\nFor those moments, he overshadowed Syl completely. Thoughts that he wasn't worthy to stand by her side didn't even have a chance to manifest before they were ruthlessly crushed. It was to the point that no one even noticed the black brand between his brows.\nAt that moment, let alone those watching on, even Syl was stunned. Was this the same young man who had sat quietly within their carriage for so long? The same young man who had entered their city in rags?\nThe legs of the war horses around Leonel trembled, causing some of the riders to almost fall off completely.\nZimo's eyes narrowed. At that moment, he admonished himself for ever doubting the judgment of the Mistress.\nLeonel swept a gaze over the crowd. He knew that in order to catch Aina's attention, he had to stand out as much as possible. He no longer bothered to restrain his aura, nor did he feign his usual modesty. Since he was here, he would make sure his name resounded throughout Terrain.\nAt that moment, even the elegant Young Miss Swan couldn't help but look toward him with a hint of shock and curiosity in her eyes. Then, she swept a glance toward Syl with a teasing expression.\n...\nWithin the carriage, Heira was holding back a pouting Rie who was clearly dissatisfied by the fact she wasn't allowed to go.\n\"Sister-in-law I want to go too!\"\nHeira shook her head. \"You can enter the spectator stands with me later. You won't be able to enter the gates the normal way regardless.\"\nThough Heira spoke these words to appease Rie, it was clear that she was absentminded.\nHer gaze glistened as she watched Leonel's back through the curtains of the carriage. She felt that this was the true Leonel… But if that was the case, he'd be even more difficult to control than she thought.\nStill, he was a bit too na?ve. Regardless of what reasons he had for showing off his sharpness now, he was already being slowly ensnared by her.\nLooking toward her little sister-in-law's blushing face as she gazed toward Leonel who had suddenly appeared to her side, Heira's slight smile appeared once again.",

      "content": "Leonel's aura blazed like the sun. Somehow, even with a beauty like Syl standing by him, she was the one who was overshadowed.\n\"Who is that…?\"\nThe crowd had fallen into a temporary silence before they suddenly erupted with discussion.\n\"Am I seeing things? Did the Kaefir family marry my goddess away?\"\nIn the minds of those on Terrain, the only reason a male could be sharing a carriage like this with the younger sister of the Kaefir family Heir could only be this. These big families cared too much about their reputation to allow even an inkling of rumors to start without adequate cause. This meant that even if these two weren't betrothed now, it wouldn't be long before they were.\nOf all those here, Syl seemed to be the one who understood this the most clearly, especially after she realized her sister-in-law was actually blocking Rie from exiting the carriage.\nEven if Rie's appearance wouldn't completely quell the rumors, it would at least calm some of the heat she was feeling now.\nLeonel, however, seemed oblivious to all of this. He took a step forward, his gaze sweeping over the youths who had descended from their war horses. He could easily sense the hostility in their eyes. But, surprisingly, Zilar, who should feel the most wronged, was silent and refused to meet his eyes.\n\"I can tell that you all are unsatisfied.\"\nSyl blinked, not expecting Leonel to be so direct. The version of Leonel she knew was closed off and restrained. She had no idea that this wasn't the real Leonel.\nLeonel wasn't a cold or arrogant person. He liked to think of himself as social and lively. But, circumstances seemed to constantly be pushing his true self away.\nHearing Leonel's words, as though they held some compelling spell to them, the youths who were glaring at him still couldn't help but listen.\n\"And, though I know you all don't want to hear it, I'm sure you also understand that it wasn't my choice to be here either, right?\"\nZilar clenched his fists.\n\"Hey, watch your words!\"\nA petite young woman stepped toward Leonel. Clearly she didn't like Leonel's words.\nWhat worse thing was there to hear after losing something that the person who got it didn't even appreciate it? In some ways, that felt worse than said person just gloating.\nThat said, how could Leonel not understand this?\nHe swept a glance toward the petite young woman, causing her next words to get caught in her throat. For whatever reason, beneath Leonel's direct gaze, she couldn't seem to muster up any courage to continue her tirade.\n\"I don't say this to belittle Zilar, I say this so that we can get an understanding of one another. Those were simply my feelings in the past. Now that I've seen those city gates and laid eyes on the war scenes it depicts…\"\nLeonel's hair billowed beneath his aura, his eyes blazing like two torches. He couldn't help but grin, the rushing of his blood sounding like crashing waterfalls in his ears.\n\"… I have not a single intention of giving my spot up.\"\nLeonel's almost fiendish grin caused the petite woman to stumble.\n\"You seven and Syl are my teammates. I hope that instead of letting animosity get the best of you, you'll realize that sabotaging me is the very same as disrespecting Zilar.\"\nThe young woman and the others were stunned.\nThat was right, if they could get enraged simply because Leonel said that he didn't want the position to begin with, how much worse would it be to ruin the opportunity he had?\nSuddenly, the petite young woman felt as though she had fallen into a trap she couldn't get out of.\nLeonel smiled. \"Let's go.\"\nLeonel turned toward the gates. Despite the fact they were half a kilometer away, it felt as though they were bearing down on him. This level of majesty was far beyond anything he had seen in his lifetime before.\nSyl and the others subconsciously followed his steps, not realizing their actions until Leonel suddenly stopped and looked back toward Zilar.\nZilar stood with his fists clenched, looking toward their backs as blood trickled between his fingers. He was the first person to not avoid Leonel's gaze when he met them.\n\"Second place was never an option for me.\" Leonel said plainly.\nAt first, it sounded as though Leonel was leaving behind some scolding words for Zilar. However, what Zilar heard was completely different. What he heard was a promise.\nSyl blinked, not really believing what she was seeing. How did he rein in these arrogant geniuses? Even she could hardly do it, and that was only because of her family background while the other half of the reason was because they wanted to marry her. Plus… How did she suddenly become a background character?\nBefore she could realize what was happening, their group had caught up to the Swan family's.\nLeonel stood at the helm with Syl by his side. Young Miss Swan stood at the forefront of her own group, looking toward them curiously.\nAll of them stood at the demarcation line. Those without talent didn't dare to cross this 500 meter mark from the Brave City Gates. If they dared to do so, they would only be asking for death.\nYoung Miss Swan blinked. \"Is this your man, Little Syl? He's quite good. I'm a little bit jealous.\"\nLeonel pretended as though he hadn't heard anything, but Syl suddenly became flushed.\nThe men within Young Miss Swan's group stared daggers toward Leonel. It seemed they didn't quite like that their goddess was praising another man.\nA particular large one amongst them, standing a head taller than even the already tall Leonel, shot an aura of competition toward him.\nLeonel planned to ignore this and take the first step forward, however, it was then that a rush surged through the crowd once again.. It seemed that another City Lord power had appeared.",

      "content": "\"The Black City escort!\"\nThis City seemed to take their name quite seriously. Their war steeds were a deep shade of night with a singular jagged horn gracing their foreheads. Their carriage seemed carved of carbon and an oppressive aura hung over them all.\nBANG!\nThe carriage doors opened.\nThe first thing anyone saw was a heavily armored leg smashing against the ground. Leonel could tell that if it wasn't for the fact this was a Fourth Dimensional world, the ground would have been cracked beyond repair.\nBut, even then, the weight of this man was undeniable. And, when he came into view, his oppressive presence seemed to overshadow all things.\nThe man's beard could only be described as… furious. It ran across his face and jaw like the blades of a knife. It was objectively unkempt. But, if the man groomed it, something would feel off as though this was his natural state.\nThe state of the man's face made it hard to tell his age. But, those with sharp senses could tell that he was also a youth.\nHis heavy black armor clinked about as he walked. Without having to say a word, eight followed him in tow, soon reaching the demarcation line as well.\nAt that moment, the young man grinned seeing the two beauties.\n\"Lucky, lucky. I was assigned to the same entrance as two beauties.\"\nSyl and Young Miss Swan looked toward this young man with a hint of disgust and trepidation in their eyes. It was clear to them that Leonel was far more pleasing to the eye, especially since other than his odd beard, this young man's head reflected the sun about as well as a polished mirror.\nThat said, considering his status, his bald head had never gotten in his way of wooing women. So, why would he care.\nAt that moment, the little mink around Leonel's shoulder snickered. It seemed that many had missed its presence, just like many hadn't noticed the brand between Leonel's brows.\nWhen the man heard this, it looked toward Leonel and found the little mink, causing his eyes to glow. He could sense something he deeply liked within the body of this little mink.\n\"I want your beast.\" He suddenly said.\nThe little mink hopped to Leonel's head, wrapping around itself and yawning. The appearance of its little pink tongue made it seem as though it wasn't worried about the black armored, bald man at all.\nLeonel swept a glance toward the black armored man.\nThere was a reason he had waited here and it definitely wasn't out of respect for this man.\nAchievements were only worth something if others didn't achieve. There would be no happiness if there was no sadness, no joy if there was no despair. The more people there were to act as a contrast to him, the better.\nThe black armored man could tell that despite the fact Leonel had to look up, he wasn't oppressed by his aura in the slightest. However, unlike everyone else who had been starstruck by Leonel's appearance, the black armored man was, likewise, not.\n\"Life's unfair.\" Leonel said plainly. \"Unfortunately, you can't always have what you want.\"\nHearing Leonel's words, the young man was stunned for a moment before suddenly grinning fiendishly.\n\"Slave brand. Third Dimension. Little pretty gigolo. I never thought that someone like this would actually dare to speak to me in this way.\"\nThe man's words were like a bomb going off in the crowd. Everyone had been so overwhelmed by Leonel's presence that they hardly dared to observe him closely. It was only after hearing these things that they suddenly realized that the black armored man was correct.\nLeonel's lip curled, but the smile held a hint of coldness to it.\nHe actually didn't mind the man saying such words. Sometimes, infamy was the best form of fame.\nHowever, Leonel still marked this man as one that needed to be taught a lesson. Now, he just had the perfect excuse to do so.\nSeeing Leonel's unperturbed smile, the black armored man felt some discomfort.\n\"It seems we have something in common.\" Leonel said lightly. \"Before, no one dared to speak to me in this way either. It was only after the world began to change that some gained an overinflated sense of self-importance. It seems like you're another one of them.\n\"How about we make a bet?\"\nThe smile within Leonel's gaze deepened.\n\"I don't have any words as pointed as gigolo to call you, but what do you say, baldy?\"\nThe man's gaze narrowed as a silence fell over the crowd.\n\"It seems you want to die.\"\nHis voice became like gravel as his aura bore down on Leonel.\n\"Do you accept, or not, baldy?\" Leonel replied.\nThe man stared toward Leonel before bursting out into a fit of laughter. When he finally stopped, his aura had become as heavy as a mountain, bearing down on everyone present. Whether it was his love of women or his want for the little mink, he forgot about them all in that very instant.\n\"What is this bet? If the stakes are too small, I just might take your life right here and now.\"\n\"Isn't there a trial right before us now?\" Leonel said plainly. \"I'll not only outperform you, I'll embarrass you. As for the stakes… Do you dare to bet your life?\"\nMaybe it was because the valiant aura of the Brave City Gates was fueling his raging blood. Or, maybe it was because Leonel was going all out to stand out as much as possible… but, whatever the truth was, a bloodthirsty and cold presence seemed to exude from him.\nThe man faltered slightly. Then, he seemed to truly see Leonel for the first time.\n\"I, Jefrach Black, have never stepped down from any challenge.\"\n\"Good.\" Leonel replied plainly.\nLeonel took a step forward and crossed the line. As though a beast was roaring in his face, his hair whipped back violently, his face even distorting slightly.\n\"Since you've reported your name, I'll do the same. I'm Leonel Morales.. Remember it well.\"",

      "content": "Syl panicked. The first reason was Leonel's crazy challenge and the second reason was the little mink.\nLeonel was still in the Third Dimension while Jefrach had long since entered the Fourth. On top of that, there was no way the little mink could withstand the pressure of Brave City.\nShe had been so distracted before that she hadn't remembered the little beast until Jefrach mentioned it. Now that she had, she couldn't help but close her eyes, not wanting to watch such an innocent little beast die like this.\nHowever, even with her eyes closed and several seconds ticking by, the sounds she expected to hear never reached her ears.\nEveryone watched in shock as Leonel took one step after another. It seemed as though the pressure couldn't do much more to him than kick up a strong wind.\nAs for the little mink, it growled a bit. But, afterward, its body exuded a slight black fog. Soon, it was sleeping again as though nothing had happened.\nAt that moment, Leonel turned back toward their group.\n\"Aren't you all coming?\" Leonel asked.\nWith that, Leonel continued forward. In his sights, the looming walls bore down on him as though trying to crush his will.\nSyl grit her teeth and took a step forward as well. The instant she did, she felt her knees buckle for a moment before they straightened.\nAs though her actions were a cue, the youths began to move as one, their actions the subject of great entertainment for the surrounding crowd that didn't dare to follow.\nJefrach, too, took a heavy step forward, plowing through the pressure until he matched up to Leonel's speed. His gaze didn't leave Leonel's side profile as though he was waiting for the latter to collapse.\nSince he had accepted the bet, he wouldn't attack Leonel now. However, the moment Leonel showed any signs of collapsing, he would strike him dead. No one, not even his own brothers, would dare to talk to him in the way Leonel had. And, this arrogant prick actually dared to report his name right after his?\nHe really wanted to see how far a Third Dimensional ant could go.\nAt that moment, across the Eight Gates of Brave City, similar competitions were happening all over. The fervor of the crowds in these locations were no less. However, the location of the Swan, Keafir and Black families was still among the most heated. How could it not be if a bet to the death was taking place?\nHowever, the quick conclusion many were expecting never came.\nLeonel's steps remained steady. In fact, it seemed as though he had forgotten all about the world around him. He continued to stare intently at the Gates before him, the images of battle being firmly ingrained into his mind.\nHe lost himself in his focus, causing a familiar aura to billow out from around him.\nJefrach felt his heart seize when he felt it.\nTo a genius like him, making it to the Gates was an easy task. He was leisurely strolling just like Leonel was. They both knew that the true distinguishing factors would only make themselves known at the Gates themselves.\nHowever, feeling such an aura, Jefrach steps faltered. He even felt that the pressure coming from Leonel was a step more forceful than even the Brave City Gates.\nSoon, the group separated.\nIn the very front, there was Leonel and Jefrach. A step behind them were Young Miss Swan and Syl. And, much further behind them were the petite young woman and the other lackies of the City Lord powers.\n\"Who is he?\" Young Miss Swan looked toward Syl with curious, blinking eyes.\nA delicate sweat covered her elegant brow. But, rather than destroying her demeanor, it made her look more pitiable. She played the role of vulnerable princess in need of saving exceptionally well.\nIt was clear that the two women could be walking side by side with Leonel and Jefrach should they want to. However, there was no need to enter a big dick contest between men. Whether they reached the Gates first or last, it wouldn't make much of a difference as long as they did so within the allotted time.\nRealizing this, why would Young Miss Swan not take the opportunity to learn a bit more about this mysterious Leonel character.\nSyl blinked innocently, a beautiful smile crossing her soft pink lips.\n\"None of your business.\"\nThe two women walked side by side, smiling amicably. Yet, the atmosphere was deathly cold. Maybe this was the hypocrisy of women. They too were having their own big dick contest, it was just more covert.\nAt that moment, Jefrach was still observing Leonel. Maybe due to the influence of the Brave City Gates, but he was the only one who could sense this oppressive aura coming from Leonel. He seemed to realize this as well judging by the reactions of everyone else, so he bit down hard on his tongue so as not to lose face.\nHowever, Leonel couldn't be bothered to deal with him. A huge chunk of Urbe Ore suddenly appeared in his hand.\n'This pressure… makes it easier to absorb the Urbe Essence…'\nThanks to his breakthrough, Leonel was already within the Superior Stage. At this level, his body was already comparable to a weak Pseudo Fourth Dimension metal and he was only a stage away from Perfection.\nDisregard…\nLeonel had already gotten his use out of Jefrach. What happened from here on out between them didn't matter to him as long as he beat him.\nJefrach seemed to sense this as well and it lit a fire in his chest. However, no amount of his anger seemed to change a single thing.\nFor entities as strong as them, it should have only taken less than a minute to cross 500 meters. Yet, under the pressure, it took them a half hour.\nWhen the Gates became clear, everyone seemed to understand that this was where the true trial began.\nThe doors loomed to an impossibly tall height. Standing beneath them, Leonel could only lift his head vertically. And even then, it was hard to see the tops of the walls.\nHowever, it was these very doors they needed to push to enter…",

      "content": "Jefrach was drenched in sweat.\nIn order not to lose face, he had kept up with Leonel's pace from start to finish. But the result made his lung scream.\nUnfortunately, the pressure of the Gates had nothing to do with strength. Even a Fifth Dimensional entity would face a proportional amount of pressure. This was, of course, the same for Jefrach.\nBut, what Jefrach couldn't believe was that Leonel seemed unaffected. Let alone breathing as heavily as him, Leonel didn't even seem as though he had sweated a single drop. To make matters worse, Jefrach was certain that the reason he was in such a sorry state was because of the pressure of the wall, but rather because of the pressure from Leonel himself.\nFinally, for the first time since their competition began, Leonel looked toward Jefrach.\n\"You don't look too good, baldy. You doing okay?\"\nJefrach's gaze flashed with a bloody red. He glared at Leonel, his chest heaving.\nAt that moment, from atop the city walls, a few individuals looked down with curiosity. They all seemed like youths as well. However, whether they had gone through the same trials or not was unknown.\n\"Isn't that Black City's bald boy? He looks like he's in a pretty sorry state, what happened to him?\"\nThe few on the wall chuckled. However, let alone hearing them, those below couldn't even see them. It was as though they were in a completely different world.\nThe only one who frowned, seemingly realizing something was off, was Leonel. However, even with his senses, he had no way of seeing through the Brave City barrier. He only felt a faint itching at the small of his back as though he was being watched.\n\"Which door do you think they'll be able to open?\"\n\"Pft, aren't you just wondering if we'll have any competition?\"\n\"Regardless, if they're anything below Royal it'll be too much of a disappointment. If that was the case, I would have gotten up to come all the way over here for no reason.\"\n\"If you wanted to watch true elites, you should have gone to watch the Gates with Powers rather than this City Lord Gate. It's rare for anything meaningful to come out of the Cities. And, those that are worth watching have already entered the city.\"\n\"Well, isn't that that madman's sister down there? Maybe the genes run in the Keafir family.\"\nThe others looked at the young man who spoke like he was crazy.\n\"You know that madman is over protective about anything related to his wife and his little sister. You better watch your mouth. I don't care if you die, but if I'm guilty by association, who will I go complain to?\"\nIt was clear that these people were speaking about Syl's elder brother. It seemed that he had already entered the city. However, oddly enough, his wife and Syl's sister-in-law, Heira, didn't seem to be a participant.\nIt obviously wasn't because Heira was too weak and it obviously wasn't because she was too old… Whatever the true reason behind this was seemed a bit complicated.\nRegardless, Leonel wasn't privy to this information as he couldn't even hear the conversation.\nStill, all those on the top of the city walls seemed to accept this person's word as law and they all closed their mouths.\n\"… It's a shame though.\" Someone else picked up the conversation that had fallen to silence. \"The Cities are only going to fall further and further behind the Powers at this rate. If they don't get themselves together and see the bigger picture, they'll be left behind.\"\nThe others sneered hearing this. It was clear they were all from Powers themselves, or they wouldn't be reacting like this.\n\"It isn't their fault. Their structures are flawed from the beginning. Us Powers are built on strength first and foremost while their foundations are economy and governance. To them, abandoning Terrain would ruin their futures completely, whereas for us, wherever there's room for self improvement, we'll be able to thrive.\n\"They only have themselves to blame for their collapse.\"\nThe words these young masters spoke easily uncovered the dark underbelly of Terrain without regard. Unlike the common people who had to tiptoe around their words, these nobles spoke their minds freely and boldly. This was the representation of true power.\nThe group snickered.\n\"Oh, looks like someone is going to try? Huh? Is that boy really in the Third Dimension?\"\nThey had been so lost in their own worlds that it was only now they noticed that the young man teaching Jerach his place was actually within the Third Dimension.\nFor one, they had never heard of a person in the Third Dimension even making it through the pressure of the Gates. Though the pressure was adjusted based on strength, there was still a minimum requirement for foundation. They had simply never seen someone within the Third Dimension meet these standards.\nAnd, secondly, anyone who could make a fool out of Jerach should definitely be a monster.\nThe only reason they hadn't paid more attention to Leonel before despite this was because the City Lord system was declining harshly. Though Jerach had some fame, they all docked him several points simply by virtue of this.\nWhy would they care about someone who was only beating someone they didn't care much about to begin with? Would you care about the power of someone capable of stomping an ant to death?\n\"He…\"\nBANG!\nAt that moment, Leonel's palm touched the tall doors, his robes and hair billowing.\nJerach, who was already hardly able to stand on his own two feet, was blasted flying, rolling in the dirt until he slowly landed before the feet of the two women who were still a good distance from the Gates.\nLeonel felt a force trying to rip his arm apart. Strong energies surged toward him, but they rebounded off his body like crossing blades, filling the air with the sound of harsh sharpening metal.\nBANG!\nThe ground beneath Leonel's feet cracked slightly. Fine lines raced across, meeting together and separating just as quickly as they spread outward.\nLeonel closed his eyes.\nHe could sense the five levels of the door. In fact, it wasn't much different from the scene he saw when unlocking his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor.\nSoldier. General. Royal. King. Emperor.\nThe whole city quaked.\nLeonel thought of waiting for Jerach to go first again. But, after seeing his poor performance, Leonel felt that it was beneath him to even need such a person to contrast himself with. He simply served no purpose.\nIn that case, he would make it a one man show.\nHis singular palm rested the door. He could feel it pushing back against him, wanting to throw him away the very same way Jerach had been.\nLeonel's eyes shot open. Bronze Runes raced across his body, a halo of bronze violet appearing above his head.\nThose with Lineage Factors suddenly felt their hearts tremble, their blood running in reverse.\n\"Open.\"\nBANG!\nThe scene was one those watching would never forget.",

      "content": "BANG! BANG!\nThe Gates flew open. In those moments, it felt as though a tornado had formed around Leonel.\nOn one side, wind rushed in violently, blowing everything away. On the other, an undefeatable suction surged, sweeping up everything in a rush of quicksand-like wind.\nHowever, nothing was as deafening as the sound of the Gates smashing against the hallowed walls of Brave City. The reverberation was so resounding, so cacophonic, so tempestuous that the whole city quaked.\nAt that moment, no matter what section of the city you were in, everyone looked toward the same direction, shock coloring their features.\nThis commotion? What could it possibly be?\nThose that could see what was happening were shocked to the point of speechlessness. The crowd that had been spectating from half a kilometer away only saw Leonel place a single palm forward before doors that towered into the skies nearly flew off their hinges beneath his presence. In fact, the ground beneath their feet quaked endlessly, causing some weaker individuals to fall to their buts, unable to understand what they had just seen.\nJust what level of strength was this?\nOf course, these people had no idea that opening the doors wasn't a contest of strength, it was a contest of will and battle aura. However, to Leonel, who had already fully awakened the first level of his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor… It was nothing but a joke. In fact, Leonel even felt it was too easy.\n'Soldier, General, Royal, King and Emperor?' Leonel thought to himself, looking into the massive window toward the city he had created himself. 'Something seems to be missing…'\nLeonel took a step forward, crossing the threshold.\nA wash of energy flooded toward him, coalescing into a golden brand between his brows.\nCompared to the Runes that shone across his body, it was lacking in momentum and radiance. However, to those of Brave City, this golden mark was the highest entry honor of the city… the Emperor Class!\nLeonel had no idea the level of commotion his actions would cause.\n**\nBrave City was separated into tiers. Much like some parts of society, there were locations one could not enter without the appropriate credentials or standing. Within the City, these separating lines were even more exaggerated.\nThe city itself isn't like how one would think it would be. Rather than being a metropolis, Brave City looked more like a war camp.\nThere were no paved roads. Just like the outside of the city walls, the ground was covered in nothing but a brownish soil that looked like the land of a military practice ground.\nIn every which direction, one could find monuments of stone called the Bravery Pillars. They depicted the exploits of soldiers and generals of the past and were among the most important staples of Brave City.\nRather than buildings, much of Brave City was an arrangement of tents, especially the outer city limits. Only Royals were allowed to live in small hut-like structures while only Emperors had stone housing for themselves.\nHowever, despite this seemingly organized structure, there was nothing peaceful about this city.\nBattles of all sorts seemed to take place every moment. Whether it was a battle for resources, for the monuments or even for housing, it seemed as though one would take place all the time.\nOutside of the seemingly territorial housing system, there didn't seem to be a single ounce of order throughout the whole city… Except for in just one place.\nA singular tower stood in the very middle of the city. Aside from the walls of the city itself, it was the only structure that stood above two or three stories tall. In fact, it shot hundreds of meters into the air much like the war etched walls on the outside.\nFrom the top of this tower, one could overlook the whole city and all eight of its Gates. However, to be able to step to this floor, the minimum requirement was to be a King. For someone of such standing, they obviously wouldn't come here to overlook ants they thought to be beneath them.\nThat said… there were exceptions to every rule.\nJust how much commotion would the swinging of doors hundreds of meters high cause? Just how much worse would this commotion be if the action was so violent that the doors hardly stopped even after slamming into the walls that held it up?\nEveryone knew that for the whole gate to open, it could only mean that a new Emperor had appeared. However, even past Emperors hadn't caused such a commotion and most people could only hurriedly squeeze through a crack they caused in the Gates. Who had ever heard of someone being given such a wide berth?\nAt that moment, the usually bustling top tower floor fell into silence. Their eyes all landed on the same young man.\nCompared to the size of the doors, he seemed so small, like an ant that could be stamped into a meat paste at any moment.\nHowever, it was as though the doors didn't dare to close as he walked through. They stayed attached to the walls, still reverberating with residue of the previous impact that, even to this moment, resounded in everyone's ears like an endless echo.\nWho is that?\nThey were all stunned to find out that none of them recognized the young man. Other than feeling some trembling in their hearts toward the odds Runes drawn across his body, there was nothing else they could glean about him.\nIt seemed that a variable had appeared.\nWithin the tower, three familiar faces could be found. Well, they weren't quite familiar to Leonel. However, had Aina been there, there would be no doubt that she would recognize these people at first glance.\nYoung Heir of Cliff's Edge Terrace, Reynred Solar.\nYoung Heirress to World's End Falls, Jilniya Falls.\nYoung Heir to Mirage Pavilion, Wilas Mirage.\nThese four people had no idea how they were connected, but it didn't seem to matter. Brave City would make them enemies regardless.\nAt that moment, as though everyone had realized a singular threat before them, several auras locked onto Leonel.",

      "content": "BANG!\nA shadowy figure shot through the roof of an inn, causing brick and chips of wood to fly through the air.\nThe shocked screams of the citizens rocked the small city, but the shadowy figure continued to leap from wall to wall and house to house, eventually landing atop the city walls.\nThese walls couldn't compare to those of Brave City in the slightest. They were at most ten meters tall and a few meters thick. This place was only considered a Tier 7 City that couldn't compare even to Swan, Black or Keafir City.\nHowever, it was unique in that rather than being under the jurisdiction of a City Lord power, it was beneath the Power of World's End Falls.\nWhen the shadowy figure finally came to a stop, those that could see it shivered.\nThe figure was completely covered in a black cloak. Its back hunched up in a curved arc, making it difficult to tell just how someone with a body like this could possibly move so agilely.\nThe figure held a massive great sword in their hands that spanned the length of three meters. Even now, it glistened with the blood of several guards.\nAt that moment, the city guards charged from all directions wearing white robes alternating in a sky blue soft armor.\n\"Sword Monstress!\"\nThe cloak covering the face of the Sword Monstress blew off, revealing the figures features. It took but a moment for them all to recognize this scourge of Terrain.\nShe could only be described as a grotesque woman. She had a hunched back, her hair was unkempt and wild, and her face made the stomachs of all those who saw her crawl.\nThey had long since lost count of the number of massacres this beast had been the cause of. She had wanted posters almost everywhere, yet she somehow managed to vanish whenever they seemed close to catching her.\nThe Sword Monstress' gaze looked particularly demonic. As though she had lost all sense of human reason, she all but growled in response.\nWithout a word, she leapt forward, her monstrous sword being raised in her claw-like hands.\nThe guard who had spoken found his vision splitting in two. Before he could even react, his consciousness faded, his body falling to the ground in two halves.\nThe Sword Montress' body flashed, her sword drawing lines of crimson throughout the streets.\nBlood flowed to the stone paved ground, seeping through the cracks and dying them red.\nEach life she reaped was only met by a violent gaze that only seemed to grow more and more bloodthirsty. It was as though it wasn't enough, as though she wanted more.\nAt that moment, the Head Guard of the Tier 7 City had finally gotten word of what was happening and began to rush over.\nThe Sword Monstress, seemingly realizing the incoming danger, suddenly stopped her endless slaughter. She looked toward the distance, two sharp teeth shining through her heaving breath.\nHer body blurred, accelerating toward the distance. She leapt over the city wall as though it didn't exist, vanishing toward the wilderness before the Head Guard could long onto her.\nBy the time the Head Guard appeared amidst the carnage, she had already long since left, leaving him standing there with a chest filled with rage and nothing to vent it on.\n\"Inform the higher ups that she's escaped the encirclement by unknown means. Her next destination is unknown.\"\nThe Head Guard clenched his fists. He already knew that his punishment for this wouldn't be small, but it was simply too difficult to lock onto a single target who hadn't been branded.\nWith everyone headed toward Brave City, the in and outflux of tourists and citizens was too high. This was likely the worst time to be trying to catch a criminal…\n**\nLeonel walked into the city. He swept his gaze over everything once before heading in deeper.\nHeira hadn't told him much about the city and how things worked. All he knew was that entering was a test and the better he performed, the greater benefits there was. Other than this, he also knew that when he chose an abode to stay in, he had to stay in this Eastern Section of the city since he entered through the Eastern Section.\nThis wasn't to say that it was impossible to travel to other Sections, but rather that it was seen as an act of war that could spark something he currently didn't have the means to deal with.\nLeonel, though, had his own reasons for being eager to enter the city. It wasn't just about making his name known so he could find Aina easier, it was also about finding a safe place to breakthrough.\nLeonel felt like Brave City was the best place he could ever find to breakthrough with his Soul Force. In fact, Leonel knew that he had no choice but to do this. If he didn't, he would have no way of dealing with the trials to come in the future.\nAfter claiming a home, you could receive a half day's protection. But, after that, Leonel knew that trouble would come knocking at his door.\nIn truth, even if he broke through, Leonel wasn't quite confident in protecting himself. All of the spells he had, even the most powerful Three Star Magus Arts, were still mere Third Dimensional spells. Leonel didn't know how useful they would be against Fourth Dimensional existences.\nKnowing this, rather than going off to quickly find a house to claim, Leonel waited for Syl. He felt that this city would most definitely have opportunities for him to take advantage of. He would take his time to find them before taking advantage of the 12 hour protection he would receive.\nThis was, of course, the best plan. Leonel's thoughts were meticulous and well thought out. It was just a shame that trouble would find him before he could act on it completely.\nThose youths that had just been standing atop the wall recovered from their shock and stabilized their feet, having almost fallen from the wall thanks to Leonel's entry.\nAfter sending a glance toward each other, one after another, they descended the walls. Soon, they stood on level ground along with Leonel as the heavy gates slammed shut.\nBANG!",

      "content": "Leonel swept a glance toward the group before him. Though there were just four of them, each had the marks of Royals on their foreheads. Leonel still wasn't exactly sure what this system of ranking meant, but just by virtue of this, he was aware of why these four had come.\nHowever, he wasn't worried. These four didn't have any ability to take his mark of an Emperor until he chose a home and had held it in his possession for 12 hours. Since he hadn't even chosen a home yet, it was impossible for them to do so.\nThat said, that didn't mean they couldn't act without reward, likely in an attempt to get him to hand over the mark himself.\nThe four young men and women looked Leonel up and down with curiosity.\n\"Who are you?\" One of them suddenly asked.\nThe speaker wore red robes matched with violet soft armor. Had Leonel been well informed, he would know that this young man came from Mirage Pavilion. However, considering his ignorance, other than noticing the well matched colors, he didn't really think anything more of it.\nLeonel smiled carefreely. \"My name is Leonel Morales.\"\nIn Leonel's opinion, the more people who knew his name, the better. He didn't care about what tone the speaker was using, even if he was quite condescending. All that mattered to Leonel was that more people knew his name.\nThe happenings of Terrain meant little to him and he also didn't particularly care about what this Brave City represented and the reason so many youths had come to this place. All he cared about was making his way back to Earth after finding Aina.\nIf Leonel were to say what his goals were aside from finding her, it would only be destroying the Royal Blue Fort and helping Aina get revenge. Though he didn't know the full extent of Aina's backstory, knowing that the Brazinger family had wronged her was enough for him.\nSeeing Leonel's bright smile, the four were caught off guard. They had fully expected Leonel to lash out or even ignore them, giving them ample reason to stomp all over his pride.\nThough they asked who Leonel was, they already knew that he was a member of the Keafir family. To them, other than Syl's elder brother there was no one else worth fearing from this family. Even if Leonel was a bit more talented than their usual selections, so what? He was still within the Third Dimension.\nEven the weakest individual knew how impossible it was to cross the Dimensional barrier to battle, let alone doing so against four people. As far as they were concerned, Leonel was finished.\nHowever… As the saying went, it was hard to punch a smiling face.\nAt that moment, the large doors were opened once again. However, this time, instead of the whole gate moving, it was simply one of the inner gates. And, instead of it almost flying from its hinges as it had done just moments ago, barely a crack was formed for a tall, black armored figure to squeeze through in a sorry state.\nIt could only be said that the harsh reality of comparing yourself to another was too heart wrenching.\nJerach practically collapsed to the ground, heaving out such heavy breaths that it seemed he might cough up his lung at any moment.\nHe placed his hands on his knees to keep himself from lying flat on the dusty roads. Unfortunately, he huffed up a big mouthful of kicked up dirt, causing him to cough violently.\nHe couldn't have been in a sorrier state, causing the four youths to snicker.\nWhen Jerach heard this, he looked up, his eyes reddening.\n\"Who the fuck are you? You dare to laugh at me?!\"\nThe youths wanted to laugh again, but Jerach suddenly vanished, appearing amidst the group and sending out a fist.\nThe air shook beneath his strength, folding in on itself and layering his fists in a quaking wind.\nLeonel's lip twitched as he watched this.\n'What kind of man with a wind affinity this high wears heavy army like that? At first glance, he should be an earth affinity mage like me…'\nBANG!\nThe youth from the Mirage Pavilion was sent flying. Leonel could tell with a single glance that his jaw was snapped from its hinges. It was clear that whatever meals this youth would be having over the next few weeks would have to be through a straw.\n\"Who else?! Who else was laughing it up?! Come on, tell me! Where's the joke?! I want to laugh too!\"\nIt was impossible for anyone to tell that these four youths had just been standing atop the walls of the city, commenting on how weak Jerach was.\nLeonel watched in silence, a slight smile tugging at the corner of his lip. This Jerach was… an interesting character.\nJerach's fist slammed into the second male, sending him tumbling toward the first. They piled atop of one another, groaning and without the strength to stand.\n\"Get a room you bunch of perverts!\" Jerach growled before looking toward the two women. \"I don't hit girls!\"\nBefore the two women could sigh a breath of relief, Jerach continued.\n\"Smack each other until I'm satisfied!\"\nThe two women looked at one another then back at Jerach as though they were ready to fight to the death. But, upon seeing Jerach rubbing his fists, their hearts trembled and they turned toward one another, each trying to get the first hit in.\nJerach clapped, a wide grin spreading across his face.\nHe brought his fingers to his mouth, whistling as though he was encouraging them to go on.\n\"Go on, fight harder! … Yea, just like that ... Hey, I bet she won't be able to fight as hard if you rip her clothes! … *WHISTLE* What a show! What delicate skin! Oh, I think I see a little pink! Top tier, top tier!\"\nJerach took out some Urbe Coins and started flicking them toward the two fighting girls. He looked like he was having the time of his life.\nLeonel stood to the side, speechless.",

      "content": "Just when Jerach was getting into his groove, the Gates opened once again and this time, two women entered. Of course, they were Syl and Young Miss Swan.\nWhen the two women saw the scene before them, they charged toward Jerach like a twin pair of lionesses. In fact, they even sent glaring daggers toward Leonel for not stepping in to stop this madman earlier.\nToward such a thing, Leonel only chuckled and didn't say much. He was going to step in previously, but since they were here now, he didn't have to do anything.\n\"Alright, alright. Since these two she-devils have stepped in for you, leave your panties behind and we can call it even.\"\nThe two women shivered in terror hearing these words.\n\"Jerach!\" Syl snapped.\n\"Alright, alright. Forget it, forget it.\"\nJerach shook his head as though it was truly a pity.\nLooking quite pitiable, the two women helped their two friends up and they stumbled away. It was only now they noticed that Jerach actually had a King mark on his forehead. It seemed that they had been so distracted by how terrible he looked before that they had forgotten to account for this.\nIt was only after this that Jerach suddenly looked toward Leonel seriously.\n\"Do what you will.\"\nJerach closed his eyes, crossing his arms across his chest and lifting his neck as though waiting for a blade to run across it.\nThe little mink atop Leonel's head yawned lazily before sticking out its tongue as though to make fun of Jerach. It got bored of this quite quickly though and went back to its nap.\nLeonel could tell that the little guy was growing more languid lately. The little mink he knew was always lively and looking to play. Leonel wasn't sure if this change was it maturing or if there was another reason…\nThat aside, Leonel wasn't thinking much about this right now. He was only quite surprised that Jerach actually seemed to be waiting for death.\nOf course, Leonel had never really expected to kill him in the first place. For one, he wasn't a blood thirsty person and he didn't enjoy to kill unless it was absolutely necessary. And, secondly, he had only been saying the most boisterous things he could say for the sake of making sure his story spread as widely as possible.\nLeonel suddenly smiled. \"So your life is mine, right?\"\nJerach opened his eyes and frowned. But in the end…\n\"… Yes.\"\n\"Good.\" Leonel's smile widened. \"Follow me then. I also don't know enough about this place, so tell me about it.\"\nJerach raised his brows, unclenching fists he hadn't known he had clenched.\n\"Isn't Syl your fiancée? She didn't tell you anything about this?\"\nLeonel made a weird face. \"Fiancée? No, she isn't.\"\nSyl suddenly flushed as red as a tomato. \"Do you believe I won't rip your tongue out, Jerach?!\"\nJerach blinked. \"So, she's single?\"\n\"JERACH!\"\nYoung Miss Swan giggled from the sidelines, seemingly enjoying this quite a bit. After a while, her eyes sparkled when she looked toward Leonel.\nSo, he's single too?\nLeonel, however, was no longer paying attention to their antics. His gaze seemed to cut through space, landing on a tower in the distance. From there, he could feel numerous gazes on him, all of which seemed to be waiting for something.\nLeonel felt his blood surging.\nWho knew how long it would take him to realize that his actions over the past few hours weren't as much of an act as he thought it was?\n**\n\"… You're saying no one knows where Brave City came from?\"\nLeonel looked toward Jerach, Syl and Qiyra with a weird expression. Of course, Qiyra was the first name of Young Miss Swan. After listening to the banter between the two women, Leonel finally managed to learn this much.\n\"Well…\" Jerach mumbled. \"… There are some theories, but… Well, the truth is that as a Fourth Dimensional world, we don't have high enough standing to confirm or deny this. We only have a few rumors…\"\nLeonel could see the discomfort the three felt when Jerach said these words. It seemed that this wasn't something that was acknowledged often. But, in the grand scheme, it was nonetheless true that a Fourth Dimensional world wasn't worth mentioning. It made Leonel realize that as small as Terrain was, Earth was even more so.\n\"What rumors?\" Leonel asked.\nJerach hesitated as though he wasn't sure whether or not he should say.\nBut, maybe because he remember Leonel 'owned' his life now, he realized he had no choice.\n\"… They say that Brave Cities only appear in worlds that are at a crossroad.\"\nLeonel frowned. What was that supposed to mean? A crossroad?\n\"What kind of crossroad?\"\n\"One where we either develop ourselves or choose to abandon everything our Ancestors built.\"\nLeonel still wasn't sure if he understood what this meant, but seeing as the three were only growing more uncomfortable, he shifted his focus slightly.\n\"Then what does a Brave City get out of appearing? Is it like a Sub-Dimensional Zone?\"\n\"… Not exactly. Zones are created by the Dimensional Verse. But, Brave Cities are built by people. As for what they get out of it, they say it's recruitment.\"\nLeonel's brow raised.\n'A world at a crossroad… built by people… it's all for recruitment…?'\nLeonel couldn't help but think of the star and cross organization. Even to this point, he still didn't know their true name. All he had was a gut feeling that their scope was beyond that of just Terrain and that their uniforms were cool. There was nothing else.\nBut who knew that even before he could understand who they were, another mysterious organization would appear? In fact, this one's methods seemed even more shocking than the first.\nThe star and cross organization was still tangible to Leonel. He could see them, interact with them, and, unfortunately, be shamed by them. But, this Brave City organization had no face or image. And, they somehow managed to make a city manifest from thin air without even the strongest powers of this world understanding how.\nFor the first time, Leonel was starting to get an understanding that this new world order was anything but peaceful.",

      "content": "Leonel stood at the base of a large stone monument. Just looking at it, it exuded the same type of aura the city gates had. It was just that this aura was displayed on a much smaller scale. Rather than enveloping an area of half a kilometer, this aura acted on just the ten meter radius of the monument.\nHowever, from what Leonel could tell, this aura was actually several times that of the Gates as though it had been concentrated in place.\nMany people who stood around the monument curiously observed the new group of four. When they saw that it was made of three Kings and an Emperor, they grew shocked and began to whisper amongst each other.\nIn this sort of place, information was the greatest strength. The fact that they didn't know that these people were among the Kings and Emperors meant that they could only be new.\n\"… Leonel…\" Syl said hesitantly. \"… We still need to go report to my elder brother.\"\nLeonel frowned. Report?\nHe felt a strong feeling against doing something like this. There was no telling what kind of personality Syl's elder brother had or how he would react to Leonel's sudden appearance.\n\"Mhm, later.\" Leonel nodded noncommittedly.\nSyl bit her lip, ignoring Qiyra's amused gaze. 'This damned vixen. Is it necessary to stand so close to him?'\nStill, Leonel didn't seem to notice the squabble between these two women, nor did he seem to realize that Syl's invitation was more about getting him away from Young Miss Swan than anything else. But, whether he acknowledged it or not didn't matter much, he already had his own plan in mind.\n\"Explain these monuments to me one more time, Jerach.\"\nJerach grumbled. Was he really nothing but a glorified dictionary?\nHe had no idea that this really was the case. Leonel didn't want to expose the true capabilities of the dictionary so he continued to use it only as a translation tool. He didn't feel like falling out with another organization that lusted after his treasures.\n\"All these monuments depict moments in history. There's nothing special about them other than the fact cultivation is a bit faster if you can withstand their aura. You can see it for yourself, it's just telling the tale of some dead general.\"\nLeonel nodded.\nMaybe it was because this Brave City wasn't native to Terrain, but the words on this monument could be understood by Leonel even without using the dictionary's help.\n<Year XXXXX>\n<General Feran led his army through the Forgotten Pass…>\n<… Gained Victory after 121 days of battle…>\n<… Mounted the head of …>\nThe more Leonel read, the more useless the information seemed to become. It was almost like a newspaper article. All of the most important facts about the topic were found in the header and the first few paragraphs. As it continued, it got useless to the point of even describing what General Feran had for breakfast that morning.\nIt was no wonder Jerach had said this monument was useless. Leonel had no interest in how many women a general bedded in celebration of his victory.\nHowever, no matter how Leonel looked at it, he didn't think that these monuments were so simple because he felt danger from them. His primitive senses made him feel as though if he played around with these monuments too long he could die.\nThe weird part about this feeling was that, obviously, no had died at the hands of this monument before. Had someone died, there was no way everyone here would be so casual about it. In fact, the only slight conflict here was in decided who was allowed to enter the ten meter radius of the monument.\nOf course, danger didn't necessarily mean that this monument would be avoided. After all, with danger came opportunities. But, Jerach would have definitely mentioned it had such a danger existed.\nLeonel suddenly closed his eyes.\nA massive spherical Force Art was reflected in his mind. At that moment, his aura completely changed as though he had become one with nature. Even though he was standing right next to Qiyra, Syl and Jerach, it was as though he was in an entirely different world.\nWhen he opened his eyes again and read the first line again, a shocking change occurred.\n<General Feran…>\nBefore Leonel could continue, his vision was enveloped in blackness.\nWhen his vision returned, what he saw was no longer a monument. He saw a man wearing a fiery red armor. He sat upon a tall crimson steed and held a halberd that was just as blood red.\nThe aura he exuded was so suffocating that Leonel nearly fell to his knees.\nAt that moment, the man riding the crimson steed stood at the helm of a massive army. He was leading so many men that from afar, they looked like millions of little ants arranged into neat square formations.\nYet, despite the number of men, this man stood valiantly, his presence alone subduing the whole of the army.\nThe man leveled his halberd with the ground, his chest growing out a size as he took a deep breath.\nThe moment he released his breath, a mighty roar that shook the skies bore itself into Leonel's heart.\nBANG!\nLeonel was sent flying. Blood leaked from his nose and ears, his body skidding along the dirt roads.\nA violent Force tore through his mind, looking to tear his Ethereal Glabella to shreds. It was as though this Force wanted to erase any memories Leonel might have just gained.\n\"Leonel!\"\nJerach and the two women were shocked, not knowing what happened. They all looked around with frantic gazes as though trying to find who sneak attacked Leonel. That seemed to be the only explanation for what just happened.\nUnable to find a thing, they could only rush to his side.\nBut, Leonel was out cold, blood continuing to flow from his orifices as a violent energy continued to rampage through his mind.",

      "content": "\"Leonel! Leonel!\"\nNo matter how they shouted Leonel's name, it didn't seem to matter in the slightest. The one who attacked him must have wanted him dead, there was no other explanation.\nThe appearance of a Third Dimensional Emperor was too conspicuous. The number who wanted to take advantage of Leonel's weakness was likely not few. It was simply too easy for those Fourth Dimensional monsters to kill Leonel secretly without any of them being any wiser.\nIt couldn't be said that these three would live and die with Leonel. How could they? They had only just met.\nJerach was practically Leonel's slave now while the two women only had a small bit of budding feelings. It wasn't to the point of risking their lives.\nYet, all three of them still uncontrollably ran to Leonel's side when they saw his current state. It was clear they all had a good impression of him.\nThe little mink scrambled from Leonel's head, landing on his face and nudging him continuously.\nThe energy continued to rampage throughout Leonel's mind. But, it seemed to notice that it couldn't shatter the barriers of Leonel's Ethereal Glabella after a few attempts.\nHow could it? After awakening his Wisdom Branch, Leonel's mind had already become capable of housing Fifth Dimensional Soul Force. Even though he had yet to come in contact with Fifth Dimensional Force, it didn't change this fact. When comparing the sturdiness of one's Ethereal Glabella, Leonel was unmatched on Terrain and Earth.\nSeemingly realizing this, the energy changed its target, aiming for the Embryos that hung vulnerably within the hidden world.\nBy now, Leonel had already formed many Embryos.\nA transparent spear stood for his Spear Embryo. A Twelve Pointed Star silently whirred for his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor. A bronze-violet halo represented his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor…\nAmong them, the one that took up the most space was a bow. Harsh and violent cold winds surged around it, making it difficult even to approach. It seemed ready to tear anything that did apart.\nIt was this group that the energy surged toward, ready to tear it apart.\nWithout hesitation, it targeted Leonel's Twelve Pointed Star first. It could sense that its healing characteristic could become a problem should it be allowed to continue. So, how could it not target it first?\nBut, it was at the very moment it made contact that things suddenly changed.\nA hidden scarlet energy was stirred. It had hidden itself deeply within the Twelve Pointed Star. No, it was more accurate to say that they had completely fused.\nThe instant the energy came into contact with this scarlet Force, it collapsed. There was no suspense, no hard fought battle, no teetering on the edge of life and death…\nJust like that, it was snuffed out.\nThe moment this energy was destroyed, Leonel's eyes shot open, his heart beating heavily as though trying to escape his chest.\nHe sat up, catching Little Blackstar before he fell to the ground.\nLeonel smiled, a sight that looked a bit gruesome considering the blood running down his nose and ears.\n\"It's alright, I'm fine, I'm fine.\" Leonel comforted the little mink.\nLeonel wiped the blood from his face with an arm, looking back toward the monument. His gaze narrowed.\nHe realized something.\nAll this time, he had been subconsciously restraining his Internal Sight. But, when he meditated on the Natural Force Art, in order to appear within his Dream World and the real world at the same time, the only option was to use his Internal Sight.\nLeonel had learned from Uncle Montez that wantonly using his Internal Sight was seen as a taboo in this new world order. So, he had always been careful with doing so. This made him miss the fact that his Internal Sight was severely restricted beneath the aura of this monument.\nIt wasn't that there was nothing to gain from this monument, but rather that anything worth gaining could only be seen through Internal Sight. It wasn't even necessary for Leonel to use the Natural Force Art to see it.\nIn fact, the fact Leonel used the Natural Force Art caused him to dive too deeply into the world which was what caused such an exaggerated backlash. Had he dipped his toes in more slowly, he wouldn't have suffered nearly as badly even if he did a bit.\nComing to this realization, Leonel understood the crux of the matter.\nIn this world, without Internal Sight, it was impossible to cultivate. Due to this, it was both a point of emphasis and something that was easily glossed over.\nThese youths standing around the monument might have already tried to examine it with their Internal Sight, but because theirs was so much weaker than Leonel's, it wasn't even possible for them to cut through the pressure and touch the monument with their senses.\nTheir only option would be to walk through the pressure personally. However, the pressure here was many times that of the Gates. Most couldn't even enter a five meter radius, let alone get close enough to extend their Internal Sight.\nThis made Leoenl certain that there were very few in this Brave City who had succeeded in doing what he had. And, these people, in all likelihood, had kept this secret to themselves.\n\"… LEONEL!\"\n\"Huh?\" Leonel was suddenly awakened from his thoughts only to find that three people were standing above him.\nThese three were, of course, Jerach, Qiyra and Syl. They looked over him with a mixture of confusion and worry.\n\"Who attack you?\" Jerach was the first to ask.\n\"Oh… I'm not sure.\" Leonel shrugged. \"It was probably just a warning, or else I'd probably be dead.\"\nSeeing Leonel's nonchalant response, the three didn't know how to respond. Was this a way that someone who had just died was supposed to react?\nLeonel, however, was already thinking of other things.\nThis monument wasn't suitable for him. It was too bloodthirsty and also the general it depicted used a halberd. In truth, the halberd and spear had many similarities, but Leonel had the Spear Domain to learn everything he needed about the spear. He didn't need outside resources.\nHe needed to visit the other monuments and hopefully find something that would make his breakthrough into the Fourth Dimension with his Soul Force allow him to protect himself.\nLeonel was mostly hoping to find a Fourth Dimensional mage… If he couldn't find it within the Eastern Section of the city, he would have to travel to the other Sections even if it meant starting a war.\nJerach, Syl and Qiyra obviously had no idea what Leonel was thinking, otherwise, who knew how they'd react to this madman?",

      "content": "As much as Leonel wanted to ignore everything else around him and focus on the monuments, there was only so long he could dodge Syl.\nNot long after Leonel found out the truth about the monuments and was planning on travelling through them one by one, the remaining seven members of the Keafir family's selections finally made it through the gates.\nAside from the petite girl who had confronted Leonel initially who became a Royal, the rest were either Generals or Soldiers. With all of them now here, Leonel couldn't continue to stall Syl and had no choice but to follow her through the Eastern Sector and into the more luxurious regions.\n\"Jerach, why are you following us?\" Syl said, seemingly a bit displeased.\nApparently, she still hadn't forgotten about the words Jerach had said to take advantage of her earlier.\n\"Wherever Leonel goes, I go.\" Jerach said matter factly.\nLeonel didn't refute this. If things went south, Jerach was maybe the only protection he had. He was under no delusions that he would be able to handle Syl's elder brother on his own.\nUnless Heira had a way to contact her husband, it was unlikely that the Keafir family Heir was even aware of Leonel's existence. And, Leonel had a bad feeling that Heira wanted it this way.\nLeonel wasn't oblivious. He knew of the underhanded tricks Heira was pulling behind the scenes. One of the things he was best at was reading people. And, he wasn't new to women being fond of him.\nAs a Five Star Quarterback, there were plenty of women, even those from noble families, who were willing to throw themselves at him. Even though the occupation wasn't as respected, that was only a matter of relativity. Not every woman would be able to find a husband from a Five Star Profession of high standing. And, as a quarterback, Leonel was guaranteed to become a very rich man in the future.\nThis was all to say that Leonel could easily read the signs of women coming on to him. It was just easier to pretend to be ignorant.\nBut, by now, Leonel realized that if he allowed things to continue like this without stepping in properly, a small misunderstanding could easily become a massive one.\nThe worst part was that he couldn't just step out and say he had feelings for another woman. He was quite familiar with women and saying such a thing bluntly would only make him public enemy number one.\n'Please come back soon…' Leonel looked up into the sky, holding back crocodile tears.\nThings would be so much easier if Aina was here, even if she was still pretending to not like him.\nLeonel suddenly smiled. 'That's alright, I know you've already fallen for me.'\nSyl and Jerach looked toward Leonel's suddenly smiling face, wondering just what he was thinking about…\nAt that moment, the surroundings began to change. From dirt roads and tents, they began to see neat little huts amid smooth roads. Soon, those smooth roads became paved in stone and the huts became small houses of brick.\nEven now, one couldn't say these homes were luxurious. They were quite minimalistic compared to true behemoths one might find in the outside world. However, in this place, where the only building taller than three stories was the massive tower that connected the Sectors, this was by far the best place to live.\nEach home was gated and had a different style, exuding a different aura. Some reminded Leonel of gentle winds, others of rushing water, and still others like raging flames. However, what each house had in common was a single lamppost before its gate.\nIt only took a moment for Leonel to understand that if this lamppost was lit, the house had been claimed. If it hadn't been, then the lamppost wouldn't be.\nJudging by the current situation, there were much more homes lit than Leonel thought there would be. Were there really this many Emperors?\nSyl hesitated for a moment. Though she knew her brother would be here, she wasn't exactly sure where he would be.\n\"You don't want to choose a house?\" Jerach suddenly asked, glancing toward Leonel.\n\"Not yet.\" Leonel shook his head.\nJerach laughed. \"If I was as weak as you, I'd be hesitant too.\"\nLeonel chuckled in response, not minding. \"How'd it feel to lose to someone so weak?\"\n\"…\"\nSyl giggled, forgetting about her task to find her brother for a moment.\nJust as the group was about to continue through to see if they could find any clues, Leonel frowned. He turned back to find a young man strolling through the stone paved roads.\nHe wore white robes that shifted slightly with his every step. His long, black hair was neatly tied, making it almost impossible to make out individual strands. Everything about him exuded an air of refinement and cleanliness, almost like a diligently polished blade ready to be unsheathed.\nSyl noticed Leonel's odd reaction and turned back. Her eyes lit up in pleasant surprise.\n\"Big Brother!\"\nLeonel's gaze narrowed. He hadn't expected to run into this man so easily. And, most importantly, he hadn't expected that even after overestimating his potential abilities in his mind, that Leonel would still be so surprised by the pressure he felt from this young man.\nAs Leonel was looking toward the Keafir family Heir, he too was looking toward Leonel.\nThe Young Heir had never met Leonel before, he didn't know who he was either, but he still felt his eyes gravitate toward him. And, when he noticed the Emperor mark that barely shrouded the black brand between his brows, he felt inwardly surprised.\nFor a moment, he forgot to respond to his sister. A sword that hung to his back vibrated slightly, making it seem as though the blade might unsheathe at any moment.\nThis was the first time Leonel noticed the sword. His vision had been so focused on the young man before him.\nHowever, after a moment, he realized why he hadn't…\nThe sword wasn't attached to anything.. It floated in the air, following the young man around as though it couldn't bear to part with him… Leonel couldn't imagine the level of skill that was needed to reach such a state.",

      "content": "The atmosphere grew silent. Syl seemed to realize that something was wrong when she saw her brother and Leonel staring down one another. But, any words she wanted to speak seemed completely caught in her throat. She felt that she couldn't form the things she wanted to say no matter how hard tried.\nSHING! SHING! SHING!\nThe sword to the Young Heir's back continued to tremble. Some unknown force held it back from unsheathing.\nLeonel continued to silently watch, sizing up the young man in white before him.\nLeonel knew too little about the Fourth Dimension to accurately gauge strength. But, he could sense pressure easier than maybe anyone else. Even though this Young Heir was weaker than Uncle Zimo, considering his youth, Leonel had no doubt that there would come a day when Zimo was completely overshadowed.\nSuddenly, the pressure dispersed. The Young Heir looked from Leonel to his little sister and smiled lightly. Though the smile was a bit cold, it was filled with a doting air to it.\n\"Syl, you're here.\" The young man nodded. \"And who is this?\"\n\"Uh…\" Syl shook her head to recover. \"Sister-in-law recommended him. He's participating as one of us. His name is Leonel Morales.\"\n\"Morales…?\"\nThe young man frowned. He felt something stir within him as his thoughts drifted toward a certain memory. But, he didn't remain in a trance for long. The universe was too big, those sharing the same name were far too numerous.\nOf course, those who were on the same level as certain families wouldn't dare to share the same name. For example, there was no way someone on Terrain would take the Keafir family name. Such a person would be asking for death.\nHowever, there might very well be other Fourth Dimensional worlds where the Keafir name was used. The influence of the Keafir family wasn't large enough to instill that kind of fear.\nThis was all to say that it was a matter of perspective. And, to put this matter into perspective, the fact that this Young Heir even paused at this name meant that his scope was already far beyond those usually found on the Fourth Dimensional plane.\nA higher Dimensional world wouldn't care what ants beneath them did. But, the Young Heir knew that if by some miracle this Leonel Morales really made it to such a height, he would definitely have to change his name unless he wanted to be hunted down and executed.\nThis matter was definitely not as rare as it seemed and no small number of stubborn individuals had suffered. However, the Young Heir didn't bother to tell all of this to Leonel. Such a thing was far too distant in the future and the likelihood that Leonel would ever reach such a level was slim to none.\nThe Young Heir nodded. \"So Heira decided this…\"\nThe Young Heir was quite familiar with his wife so he had a good idea of what she was thinking. But, taking care of someone in the Third Dimension, no matter how talented they were, would be difficult. Even he didn't dare to enter Brave City until he had grown to a certain level of strength.\n\"Is there a reason the Black City Heir is here?\" Syl's elder brother asked.\nJerach snorted. 'The only difference between me and you is that you're a bit older, is there a need to stick your nose so high into the sky?'\nStill, even the usually boisterous Jerach didn't dare to say these words aloud. Though this Young Heir seemed refined, anyone who had heard of history knew that he was a madman.\n\"He's with me.\" Leonel replied, seemingly noticing Jerach's apprehension.\n\"Oh?\"\nThe Young Heir didn't ask anything further.\n\"The situation right now is a bit delicate. The trials will begin in another month, but that doesn't mean the city is safe. In fact, this is maybe the most dangerous time. There's a good chance that a territorial war could be sparked.\"\nLeonel scratched his nose, pretending as though he didn't plan on being responsible for starting one.\n\"Be sure to stay within the limits of the Eastern Sector. And, if you are going to the Central Tower, travel in pairs. Also… be cautious of the monuments.\"\nLeonel's eyes narrowed when he heard this, but didn't say anything more, waiting for the Young Heir to finish his spiel.\nAfter a while, Leonel suddenly got curious about something.\n\"What benefits are there to a territorial war? There's got to be a reason for them, right?\"\nThe Young Heir swept a glance over Leonel. Not many dared to cut him off while he was speaking like this.\nOf course, that was just the Young Heir's illusion. Leonel had waited for a slight pause in his long winded admonishment. It was clear that the Young Heir was lecturing his little sister rather than speaking for all of their benefits, so Leonel asked a question instead.\n\"… There are eight Sectors to the city. Each has their own residential area and monuments. The only way to access the other Sectors is through the Central Tower, however due to this, it also makes it very obvious when someone is crossing over to a Sector they shouldn't be in.\n\"When you enter another Sector, it becomes easier to upgrade your rank, meditating before the monuments becomes easier, and the benefits for stealing abodes is also greater.\"\n\"Benefits of abodes?\" Leonel's gaze sparkled.\n\"Yes, every abode makes it easier to cultivate a specific Special Force. The short of it is that all benefits are greater when stealing them from another Sector. But, for this reason, people are also very territorial. Considering your strength, acting on this would only lead to your death.\"\nThe Young Heir's words were quite pointed, but Leonel didn't really care to respond directly to them.\nLeonel found this Young Heir to be quite odd. At first glance, he seemed stoic, cold and quiet, but he was actually quite… long winded.\n\"I have one more question.\" Leonel pressed. \"Are there really this many Emperors?\"\nLeonel looked around at all the lit lampposts. It couldn't be that Emperors were so cheap, right?\n\"Who said an Emperor could only claim one house?\"\nLeonel's eyes widened. So this was how it was…\n\"Thanks for the help.\" Leonel said with a smile. \"I'll help out the Keafir family if I can. I'll be going now.\"\nAfter finishing his duties, Leonel bid his farewells. His thoughts were filled with how to make his imprint as big as possible.\nIf he wanted to be known, there was no better option than attacking other territories. However, Syl's brother wasn't wrong, he was too weak to do so now. He needed a few back up plans first.\nThe Young Heir's gaze narrowed as he watched Leonel's back retreat, his sword trembling once again.\nJerach followed along quickly, not knowing anything about the crazy thoughts going on in Leonel's head.",

      "content": "\"Hey, hey.\" Jerach jogged to keep up with Leonel, his heavy armor causing the paved roads to quake.\nLeonel looked back and couldn't help but smile.\n\"You know, for someone with such a strong wind affinity, shouldn't you wear something lighter than this, baldy? Who knows, your hair might grow back if you stop straining yourself so much.\"\n\"What do you know?!\" Jerach snapped like a cat that had its tail stepped on. Clearly, his baldness was a soft spot. \"It's precisely because I have a high wind affinity that I should take full advantage of it. Who else could wear such heavy army and yet still be so fast?\"\nLeonel shook his head and didn't reply to these words.\nThey sounded logical, but the truth was that Jerach's speed would never reach its full potential like that. Just from what Leonel could see alone, he would easily be two or three times faster if he took his armor off.\nOn top of that, he would never be as sturdy as someone with an earth affinity either. So, he was essentially becoming decent at many things in exchange for losing out at being excellent in one lane.\nIn a world where your life was on the line at every turn, Leonel felt that this was a mistake. But, he didn't press Jerach too much. He still needed a bodyguard, after all.\n\"… So who are you really?\" Jerach asked curiously, leveling out his steps with Leonel.\n\"I told you already, Leonel Morales.\" Leonel replied casually, looking toward the next monument.\n\"You know that's not what I mean. You use a translator, so you're obviously not from this world. I hear you came out of the same carriage as Syl, but you both deny being betrothed – you should probably hide that from that madman, by the way. If he finds out that something like that happen, he might kill you for defiling his little sister.\"\nJerach rambled.\n\"I'm from Earth.\" Leonel finally responded as Jerach had a pause.\n\"Earth?!\"\nJerach's steps stopped.\nLeonel frowned, looking back toward Jerach. \"Is there a problem?\"\n\"… No.\" Jerach shook his head.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. Was there a need for such an exaggerated reaction? Terrain was just as bad a name as Earth, after all. It could be said that all their ancestors needed some better naming sense.\nLeonel wanted to say something about Jerach's weird reaction, but he realized that they had already made it to the first monument. On the way to the Emperor abodes, Leonel had already mentally marked the locations of a few monuments.\nUnfortunately, Leonel was so focused on the monuments before him and how they could help him find Aina that he had completely missed the complicated gaze Jerach looked toward his back with.\n**\nAfter a full day, Leonel fell into his thoughts, organizing everything he had seen.\nThe Eastern Sector had 33 monuments and Leonel had been to them all. However, there were only a minority of them that caught Leonel's attention at all.\nThe first one was of a bowman.\nUnlike what Leonel had with his Spear Domain, he didn't have a set path to follow with his bow. However, it would be a shame to ignore his talent for marksmanship. The only issue was finding sources that could help him continuously increase his skill.\nOf all 33 monuments he had been to, only one of them depicted a bowman. Even now, Leonel could remember her valiant aura and golden armor. She looked like a goddess descended toward earth…\nJust from the few scenes Leonel saw, he could tell that she could control the flow of a ten kilometer radius just with her bow and arrows alone. It was a level of skill Leonel couldn't even imagine in his current state.\nThe second monument that caught Leonel's attention was of another woman. The only unfortunate part was that she was a fire mage and not an earth or light mage.\nLeonel still remembered being entranced. This woman stood in the skies wearing a fiery red robe so long it extended tens of meters past her feet. Her fiery red hair was of an obscene length as well, whipping about like rays of crimson amidst the clouds.\nThe domain that surrounded her seemed burnt to ash. The air was dry, the ground was black, the wind was scorched. It felt as though one was standing in a perpetual hell just being around her.\nLeonel remembered being in awe when he came out from the illusion before soon being disappointed. After all, he wasn't a fire mage. And, even though he had Dream Sculpted all the Mage Arts of Camelot, regardless of element, he had never even so much as used a Fire Element spell before.\nHowever, that was when something shocking happened. Leonel realized that when he looked around him, Jerach and the others who had surrounded the monument at the time had separated their distance to him by a large margin.\nAt first, Leonel had been confused, but when he look around, he found that there was a radius of scorched ground around him. In fact, the only things not burnt to ash near him was the little mink napping on his head without any worries and, luckily, his clothes.\nIt was then that Leonel came to realization… His Scarlet Star Force.\nTop ten amongst Star Elemental Forces. Top three amongst Light Elemental Forces. And…\nThe very best amongst Fire Elemental Forces.\nWithout realizing it, Leonel's affinity for fire magic had surpassed his affinity for both Earth and Light Elemental magic. Whether it was his Metal Synergy or Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factors, they were all overshadowed by his Innate Force Node. This could only be expected, after all, a Lineage Factor is passed down and must be slowly unlocked whereas an Innate Force Node was all to a person's own.\nOf course, Leonel's Scarlet Star Force also vastly improved his Light and Star Element affinity. Compared to others with Light and Star Elemental affinity, Leonel was amongst the very top few now.? However, even compared to that increase, his fire affinity still gained the greatest leap.\nEven though he couldn't use his Innate Force Node to its full potential now, simply by virtue of having it, all flames in the world bowed down to him!",

      "content": "The third monument that caught Leonel's attention was actually a sword wielding man. However, this wasn't because of the weapon. Leonel had no interest in switching from the spear. In fact, he found that he was growing more and more fond of the spear every day.\nThere were two reasons this monument caught his attention. For one, Leonel recognized a part of its aura. When he thought about it, he realized that it was very similar to the aura he had sensed on Syl's elder brother.\nOf course, the aura on Syl's elder brother was far weaker than the one Leonel sensed from this monument. However, it was the same aura nonetheless.\nAs the saying went, it was important to understand one's enemy. Though Syl's brother wasn't yet at such a point with Leonel, Leonel had too much PTSD from organizations he joined betraying him. By this point, he was already on his guard and was preparing for the worst case scenario.\nThat said, if it was only about understanding Syl's elder brother, Leonel wouldn't be so interested in this monument. After all, no matter how much he understood the Young Heir, it was useless if he was too weak to do anything about it. Ultimately, what was most important was his own strength.\nHowever, there was a second matter that caught Leonel's attention: The sword wielding man had a pair of wings.\nLeonel hadn't spent much time comprehending [Golden Feather Step] just yet. But, he already understood just how important movement was in battle, especially if he was the weaker party.\nIf one was far weaker in strength but had speed, there would always be a chance for survival. However, there were plenty of examples of stronger individuals suffering at the hands of those much faster than them. This was part of the reason Leonel didn't agree with Jerach's methods.\nSpeed kills.\nWhat was exceptionally beautiful about this monument was that this winged swordsman placed emphasis on his speed. His movements and swords were fluid, moving together as one. The flaps of his weapon and the swings of his sword almost looked like breathing.\nThe contraction of the diaphragm, the expansion of the lungs, the suction of air, the relaxing of the diaphragm, the shrinking of the lungs, the expelling of air…\nIn a continuous cycle, they flowed into one another, nurturing one another, strengthening one another.\nEven compared to the other monuments Leonel had lost himself in, he spent an exceptionally long time at this one despite the fact he was only trying to hop from monument to monument as quickly as possible.\nIt was thanks to this that Leonel realized something else his Dreamscape Battle Sense was missing… He didn't have enough fluidity.\nRight now, his Battle Sense worked by sensing a change and reacting to it. But, that was entirely reliant on his opponent doing something. What if Leonel ran into a patient opponent who shared a similar battle style? How would his Battle Sense react when it had no information to read?\nUnfortunately, Dyon could only store such thoughts in the back of his mind. Even this most simple version of his Battle Sense used up so much stamina, he couldn't imagine what would happen if he tried to add fluidity. He couldn't even wrap his mind around how he would do this.\nStill, this matter of fluidity taught Leonel something most could only learn after experiencing countless battles…\nMovement wasn't just about evading and defense, it was just as important in attacking. Only when one's steps flowed with one's actions seamlessly would one reach true mastery of their movement.\nLeonel was exceptionally lucky to grasp this truth before he truly began to study [Golden Feather Step]. It might even halve the time he would need to master this technique.\n…\nThese were the three monuments that had caught Leonel's attention. This was a good result.\nUnfortunately, there was bad news.\nAfter Leonel studied all the monuments, he realized that he had been mistaken. There were no hidden techniques to learn or grasp. This meant that there were no Fourth Dimensional techniques Leonel could learn to help make use of his Soul Force…\nAll the monuments seemed entirely focused on aura and feel, as though it was teaching the disposition a warrior of a certain type should have. However, there were no techniques to glean from them at all.\nSuch a reality left Leonel sighing.\n'There are important lessons to learn, but that's about it…'\nLeonel shook his head.\nThese things weren't as useless as he thought. For example, the core lesson of the winged swordsman would lay a foundation for him in movement techniques that would only exponentially multiply in the future.\nIf Leonel was correct, there were lessons to be gained from the bowman, or bowwoman, rather, and the fire mage as well. The bowwoman likely taught about control and the fire mage definitely touched upon the concept of a domain.\nStill, all of these things sounded nice, but now Leonel didn't have an obvious path toward improvement. Without matching techniques, breaking into the Fourth Dimension wouldn't create as great a boost to his strength as he would like.\nLeonel looked up to the sky and sighed. It seemed that things wouldn't be as easy as he thought. He needed to talk to the dictionary to arrange his thoughts…\nAfter a while, Leonel grit his teeth. He would have to risk it.\nThe only place he would feel safe using the dictionary was in his own protected abode. He would have to put it all on the line and claim one now. If he let things stay as is, he would eventually suffer. Hesitancy and inaction were just as bad as failing miserably at times.\nLeonel could feel many eyes on him. Many had been watching his every action for a long time now, wondering how long he could hold out.\nWhen everyone saw him walking back toward the abode setting, numerous spies sent to monitor his actions rushed back toward their masters, cold lights flickering in their gazes.\nJerach, who had followed Leonel all this time, frowned deeply. He couldn't help but look toward Leonel's side profile…\nWas he really going to do it now?",

      "content": "Leonel walked along the stone paved roads once again, calmly observing the abodes and lampposts one by one. He was easily able to see which abodes could help with what.\nMost were focused on the main elements of Fire, Wind, Earth and Water. Aside from them, there were a few rarer kinds that fell into the category of Variants.\nThe best sort of abode for Leonel would be a Star Elemental Abode. Only such a place would be highly compatible with him and would make the process of evolving his Soul Force much smoother.\nAlso, since he wasn't necessarily restricted to one abode, a metal Variant of the Earth Element would also be greatly beneficial to him. This would help him improve his Metal Body at a much quicker rate.\nThat said, this wasn't at the forefront of Leonel's mind. After all, he had long since realized that the aura beneath the Gates and monuments could also work to greatly speed up the strengthening of his Metal Body. In fact, since the aura beneath the monuments were ten times more concentrated, they were even better than the Gates had been.\nLeonel continued to walk, quickly getting a bit worried. He saw some Variant abodes, but he still hadn't seen a Star Force abode.\n\"… What are you looking for?\" Jerach finally couldn't hold back.\nIn his mind, after seeing how devastating Leonel's fire affinity was, Leonel should have long since chosen an abode. They had already passed by two Fire Elemental abodes and one Variant Fire Elemental abode.\nOf course, Jerach had no idea that Leonel had yet to consciously work on his fire affinity before.\n\"I'm looking for a Star Force abode.\" Leonel replied. There was no need to hide anything anyway since once he found such an abode, practically everyone would know about it.\n\"Star Force?!\" Jerach was shocked again.\nIt was difficult to explain just how rare those with Star affinity were. They were even on par with those that had enigmatic affinities like time and space. Star Force was the only Force in existence that could be cultivated and used no matter the environment.\nThere were many locations in the universe where energy of a certain kind became scarce and impossible to sense. Those who had such affinities that were unlucky enough to end up in such regions could only lament their bad luck and hope to survive. In such environments, even abilities could become useless.\nHowever, no matter where one was, there would always be Star, Space and Time Force. These three Forces and the other rare ones like it all had this fundamental reason that set them apart.\nSuddenly, Jerach laughed. \"No wonder, no wonder. I thought you were a madman for a second, but it seemed you had a plan too.\"\n\"Hm?\" Leonel raised an eyebrow. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\"You don't have to act ignorant anymore, I see through you.\"\nLeonel frowned in confusion. \"No, really.\"\nJerach gave Leonel a weird look. \"You really don't know?\"\n\"Really.\"\n\"Madman… Just a madman…\" Jerach grumbled. \"… Claiming an abode requires two prerequisites. The first is that you must have the appropriate rank. It's possible for an Emperor to claim a King's house but it isn't possible for a King to claim and Emperor's unless they upgrade their mark.\n\"The second prerequisite is that the trial of the abode must be passed.\"\nLeonel's gaze suddenly brightened, his steps coming to a halt.\n\"You mean to say that the trial that must be passed is related to the affinity of the abode? So, if I'm the only one with Star Force affinity…\"\n\"… If you're the only one with Star Force affinity, then it would be impossible for anyone to claim your abode other than you unless they're seeking death. The trials are quite simple if you share the necessary affinity, and you can muddle your way through Variant affinities as long as its related to your main affinity. However, if you try to claim a home you have no affinity with, heavy injury is the best case scenario.\"\nLeonel's gaze brightened like two torches.\nWas this what they called luck? Was he finally going to get something to go his way?\nLeonel was a virgin and hadn't even kissed a woman before. In fact, the only times he had even been able to touch Aina somewhat intimately was when she was either unconscious or half dead. But, he could swear that being with a woman couldn't possibly feel half as good as he was feeling right now. He almost shed real tears.\nJerach gave Leonel another odd look. 'Why does he look so happy…? Why does his expression almost look… lewd?'\nJerach almost began to shed his own tears. He could only hope that Leonel didn't use his control over his life to take his chastity.\nOf course, if others knew Jerach was thinking himself as chaste, he'd probably be stoned to death.\nAfter a moment of happiness, Leonel regained his composure.\nEven if these people couldn't try to seize his abode, the fact of the matter would be that he would still be unsafe when he left his abode. And, he would have no choice but to leave it if he wanted to make his name known to find Aina. In addition, it wasn't like he could bring the monuments into his abode either.\nHowever, this was still the greatest news he had heard in a long while. Even if he would still be at risk, he wouldn't have to worry about the 12 hour limit anymore. In addition, should things go south, he had a 'safe house' he could return to.\nOf course, this was as long as no one else had a Star affinity…\nSoon, Leonel and Jerach made it to the end of the stone paved roads. For a moment, Leonel thought he had dropped back down to an abyss because even now, he couldn't find a Star affinity abode. But, that was when his gaze landed on six homes that sat side by side. In fact, they were a measure larger than all the other homes.\nOne gave off a radiant gold light. The next pulsed with darkness. The third seemed warped, dilating one's sense of time. The fourth seemed to stand in a plane of its own – it looked as though it was right before them, yet hundreds of miles away at the same time.\nThe fifth made Leonel exceptionally excited. It, too, exuded a light. But, it was more gentle and dense than the first, not to mention warmer. This was definitely a Star affinity abode. Finally, his heart rested easy.\nHowever, when he looked at the sixth house, Leonel's steps froze again as he fell into a daze. He felt as though he experienced his whole life once again. From the day he was born to this very moment right here.\nIn his shock, Leonel saw the image of a woman gorgeous beyond words. It was the kind of beauty that seized the heart and overshadowed even Young Mistress Heira.\nShe had eyes as bright as glistening emeralds, hair like a shimmering golden-white waterfall, and a smile that made tears uncontrollably fall from Leonel's eyes.\nShe held a baby in her arms, her gaze a mixture of love and unwillingness. The image was so real that Leonel felt as though he was right there… he was the baby… he was the one being looked at in such a way…\n\"Mom…\"\nLeonel had never said these words in his life. At least, he had never said it to address another person. He never thought about his mother because he couldn't even remember her. He couldn't say he felt one way or another. But, at this moment, he felt as though his heart was bleeding.\nHow could he forget that gaze?\nWhen Leonel snapped out of it, he found himself standing in the same place staring at the same house.\n\"… Leonel! Oh, you're awake. Try not to stare at that abode too much, there've been stories of others never being able to extricate themselves. I've never heard of someone falling into a trance like you did coming out, you're very lucky.\"\nLeonel blinked, trying to regain his bearing. But, the tears didn't seem to want to stop.\n\"That abode, what is it?\" Leonel forced out, his voice shockingly steady.\n\"That?\" Jerach didn't even dare to look toward the abode as he referred to it.. \"They call it Dream Force.\"",

      "content": "The moment Leonel heard these words, he felt his mind tremble.\nAfter a moment, he wiped the tears from his eyes and shook his head.\nLeonel's personality was one that was difficult to grasp. It was hard to imagine that a person who seemed so soft hearted as him wouldn't even spare a single thought toward his mother. It wasn't rare for children who grew up with one or no parents to have fanciful images of what could have been. Of course, some grew out of this phase while others never did. However, maybe very few were like Leonel and never had such thoughts at all.\nThis was maybe one of Leonel's true faces. Though he loved, he also had a deeply calculating side to him. When he told his former best friend James that he would leave Aina alone if she truly rejected him, he hadn't been lying. If the words 'no' ever came out of her mouth or her actions ever made him feel as though she was rejecting him, he wouldn't hesitate to let that part of his heart die.\nLeonel knew this about himself. Maybe if it wasn't for the love he gained from his father, he could have very well become someone's cold killing tool. There really wasn't much separating such a person from himself aside from his upbringing.\nTo now, maybe Leonel had subconsciously accepted that his mother didn't want him so he very logically cut off that part from himself. There was no need to waste time thinking about someone who had no need for him.\nHowever, the moment he saw that gaze… everything suddenly changed for Leonel.\nAs logical and calculating as Leonel was, he was just as loving and caring. If the gaze his mother had for him was still the same, then no matter where she was, what trouble she was in, what was keeping her from his side, he would make sure to wipe it all out.\nIt was that simple to Leonel. There was nothing more to think about.\nJerach suddenly felt that suffocating aura once again. He could hardly move until Leonel finished going through his thoughts.\n\"What is Dream Force?\" Leonel suddenly asked, his heart growing calm.\nLeonel needed to know. Was it just coincidental? Or was there a reason behind everything.\n\"It's…\"\nJerach hesitated.\nThe Dream Force abode was an extremely enigmatic existence. According to what Jerach knew, it didn't appear all of the time. It would often hide itself as though it was an illusion and rarely appeared.\nHowever, the times it did appear usually led to tragedy. There were no small number of geniuses who had lost themselves in an illusion just staring at it.\nIt could be said that Jerach was lucky to not be one of them. He had been observing Leonel this whole time because he thought he was a madman. But then, Leonel suddenly stopped and entered a daze. This luckily triggered some of Jerach's memories so he didn't dare to look where Leonel was looking.\nBut, from what Jerach knew, it should have been impossible for Leonel to wake up. Yet, not only had Leonel woken up, he had only been in a daze for a few seconds at most. This left Jerach more shocked than almost anything else ever could.\nCould it be that all those legends were exaggerated? They must be…\nDespite thinking this, though, Jerach still didn't dare to look toward the sixth abode.\n\"… It's another high level Force. Wherever there are people, there will be Dream Force. So, in a way, just like how Star Force is never restricted by location, so is Dream Force. After all, if you happen to find yourself in such a place, as long as you exist, there will be Dream Force.\"\n\"But what is it exactly?\" Leonel asked, his expression having regained an eerie calm. He almost seemed too placid.\n\"I don't know much about it… I only heard someone once describe Dream Force as the representation of consciousness.\"\nLeonel's gaze sharpened.\nConsciousness… How much effort had the scientists of Earth put into finding the source of human consciousness? It was the one thing that even hundreds of years of technological advancement still couldn't describe.\nSome believed that human consciousness was stored in a soul or spirit. Others believed that everything that represented consciousness could be found within the brain and that we only couldn't describe it because we didn't understand the brain well enough…\nWhen Leonel entered this new world order, he sometimes had fleeting thoughts that maybe a soul did exist. He had seen so many fantastical powers in the past year that this was much easier to accept for him.\nYet, even now, he had yet to find this so-called 'soul' of his.\nOne had to know that Soul Force was just a name. It didn't represent a spiritual form of Leonel. It was simply an extension of Leonel's senses, another form of energy. Nothing more, nothing less.\nThis was the reason why even though Leonel knew his Ethereal Glabella inside and out, he had never run into anything like a soul in there. All one could find were his Embryos and his Stars. There was nothing else.\nBut, what Jerach was saying now was that this Dream Force represented such a thing? It left Leonel feeling… well, he wasn't exactly sure how he was feeling at all.\nAll Leonel knew was that this was the abode he would be choosing. He didn't even hesitate as he took a step toward it.\nJerach panicked. \"Hey, what are you doing?\"\nLeonel smiled lightly. \"Choosing an abode, obviously.\"\n\"You're going in the wrong direction! The Star abode is over there!\"\nLeonel smiled but didn't reply. Jerach knew well what he was doing.\nWhether it was dangerous or not, Leonel didn't care. He needed to know why his heart was thumping like this. It was the same feeling Leonel had felt when he chose [Dimensional Cleanse]. It was the same feeling he had when he chose [Golden Feather Step]. Yet, it was several times more potent than the feeling had ever been.\nWere those names he chose a coincidence?\nDream World. Dream Sculpt. Dreamscape. Dream Clone.\nHow much of it was a casual name he had given his abilities and how much of it was something compelling him toward the right path?\nLeonel had always believed that his ability and his Soul Force was inextricably linked. But, what if this wasn't entirely correct? What if he was missing something?\nLeonel took several more steps, ignoring Jerach's attempts to stop him. Eventually, the poor bald Jerach, scared for his own safety, didn't dare approach the house any closer. Though he could stop Leonel by force with his strength, he could see a look in Leonel's eye that made him not dare to do so.\nThen, Leonel crossed the threshold no one else dared to.\nWhat he didn't know was that his actions would soon cause an uproar.",

      "content": "Leonel was suddenly bombarded by a surge of Force.\nIt was unlike anything he had ever experienced before. The Force he was used to was hard to sense, but it was still tangible. Even someone with weak Internal Sight could feel it as long as the concentration was high enough.\nBut, this Force, despite being maybe in the highest concentration Leonel had ever seen, still felt… unreal.\nThe harder Leonel tried to reach out to it, the more fluidly it slipped through his fingers. It was as though Leonel was on a different plane, observing it from afar.\nHowever, despite there being such a surge, Leonel didn't feel like his life was in danger at all. In fact, he continued to walk forward without suffering any setback at all. If it wasn't for the fact he was taking his time to sense the mysteriousness of this Dream Force, he would have already long since crossed this trial.\nBefore Leonel even realized it, he had made it to the door of the Dream Force abode.\nHis palm reached out, touching the dark oak of the door.\n*CLICK*\nA light clicking sound reached Leonel's ears as the door slowly swung open.\nAt that moment, a shield of protection suddenly vibrated.\nThe lamppost that manned the outside flickered before erupting into a blinding light that shot into the skies.\nThe eyes of numerous elites swung in a single direction. They were all used to the signs of an abode being conquered by now. However, the signs had never been this exaggerated before. In the whole of Terrain's Brave City, not a single one had ever claimed one of these special abodes.\nLeonel, however, had no idea that he had suddenly become the center of attention. He was entirely immersed in an all new feeling. His body, despite standing on the ground, felt as though it was soaring into the clouds…\n…\nWhen Leonel finally snapped out of his odd state, he was uncertain of how much time had passed. But, he was no longer worried about a time limit. Compared to the Star Force abode, this Dream Force abode was even more secure. Whereas someone bold might try to force their way through the Star Force trial, Leonel didn't believe anyone would have the guts to do so with the Dream Force abode.\nFacing something tangible was always easier than facing the illusory. In this abode, it was possible to fall into an illusion without even realizing what happened. If it wasn't for Leonel's high affinity with Dream Force, he would have likely fallen into an endless cycle as well.\n'So that's how it is…'\nLeonel exhaled a long breath, looking around his new home for the next while. He couldn't help but smile, he hadn't had a place he could call home in more than a year now. He didn't know how long he would be in this Brave City, but he definitely felt at home here…\nThe whole abode was decorated in white and black. The two shades complemented and danced with one another across the home. It was warm and pleasing to the eye, leaving Leonel feeling content.\nFor the first time, Leonel didn't feel the need to ask the dictionary what was happening with him. He understood that compared to his affinity for Fire, Light, Star, or Earth, his affinity for Dream Force existed on a completely different plane of its own. It was so high, in fact, that even without being consciously aware, he had still made use of it before…\nWhenever Leonel entered his Dream World, whenever he used Dream Sculpt, whenever he formed a Dream Clone… Every time, without fail, without Dream Force as a core, he would have failed.\nTo use something so unconsciously, as though he was breathing… just what level of affinity was that?\nBut, now that Leonel knew what it was and could consciously put it into motion…\nWHOOOOSH!\nA violent torrent of Force surged toward Leonel.\nHe completely expelled all of his normal Soul Force. It was nothing but a hindrance to him, limiting his abilities and causing him to use more stamina to perform tasks that should have been as easy as breathing.\nTo Leonel, Soul Force and Dream Force were like the lubricants and fuel to a well running engine. Not only was Soul Force far lower in quality, when it combusted, it gave off countless impurities, making its efficiency horrid.\nNot everyone could do as Leonel was currently doing. Dream Force represented consciousness. Those with low affinity could easily lose themselves, forgetting what was real and what was not. Their memories would become so real that it would feel as though they were reliving them in real time. Their phobias would manifest and hold control of them. Even their loves would become larger than life, enveloping their very beings.\nThe number of pitfalls there were to using Dream Force were endless. Only those innately born with a comprehension of this Force could make use of it without losing themselves. And, thanks to his ability, Leonel just so happened to be one of these people.\nThe moment all of his Soul Force was purged, Leonel felt as though a shackle on his mind had been lifted. Dream Force began to compress within his Ethereal Glabella, wildly surging about.\nLeonel wasn't worried in the slightest. The Dream Force he was accepting now, no matter how high level of an energy it was, was still considered to be within the Fourth Dimension. With the strength of his mind, it was child's play to accept for him.\nWHOOOSH!\nThe Force around Leonel kicked up a tempest. Leonel's hair fluttered wildly, his heavy robes billowing.\nWhat sounded like shattering glass resounded in Leonel's ears.\nLeonel's eyes shot open, a bright light making his pale irises seem no dimmer than his mother's bright emerald gaze for a moment.\nLeonel felt that his mind had never been clearer. He saw the things in the world down to their most basic building blocks, seeing through the foundation even the most complex things with just a single glance.\nWith a flip of his palm, the dictionary appeared once again.\nThe last time Leonel checked the level of his ability, it had just barely crossed into the Bronze grade. Though this was still a Fifth Dimensional ability, with the other limiters on Leonel's body, it hadn't been able to truly shine.\nBut now…\n[ *Ping* ]\n[ Subject: Leonel Morales ]\n[ Calculative Mind: An ability capable of simplifying the complex. ]\n[ Evaluating power… *Ping* ]\n[Evolution Stage: Quasi Silver]",

      "content": "Leonel should have been shocked by this result. After all, the last time he checked, his ability was graded as Tier 3 Bronze. This sort of massive leap should have been completely out of expectations. But, Leonel only nodded. This much should have been expected.\nAfter purging his Soul Force, his ability should have already shot up to Tier 6 or 7. Then, after breaking through to the Fourth Dimension within his Ethereal Glabella, it shot up once again to Quasi Silver. It was very likely that at this moment, he had the most powerful ability on Terrain.\nLeonel closed his eyes, focusing on the changes to his ability.\nLeonel already knew that he wouldn't suddenly awaken new branches to his ability. His Calculative Mind ability entirely relied on himself to come up with new ways to use his computer-like brain. However, he could still check to see what improvements there had been to abilities he already created.\n'My Dream Clone limit is now 17…'\nThis was the first thing Leonel realized as it was the easiest to quantify. 17 might sound like a small change, but it became exponentially more difficult to split his mind the more ways he did so.\nOf course, it was possible for Leonel to surpass this limit of 17 if he consciously lowered the computing power of each. But, in most cases, this wouldn't be very helpful.\nLeonel's overall abilities gained a massive boost. He could Dream Sculpt in a fraction of the time, the ideas he had to improve his Dreamscape and Dreamscape Battle Sense seemed to increase like a never-ending tide, but, the most important change to Leonel was that he could see through the core secrets of the things he had Dream Sculpted.\nLeonel left his Dream World and walked out of is abode.\n\"Jerach.\" Leonel called out.\nBy now, Jerach was in a pitiful state. He didn't dare to look toward the abode, but he also felt conflicted in his heart. His pride wouldn't allow him to abandon Leonel. He hadn't been joking around when he said he would sign his life over.\nHe was a real man. He refused to do anything that encroached on his ideals for himself.\nAt that moment, Jerach had just been about to turn toward the abode. Even if he got stuck in an illusion for the rest of his life, he would have still have followed through on the thoughts of his heart.\nBut, who knew that the moment he spun around, a vicious glint in his eyes as though the abode was his mortal enemy, he would hear Leonel's voice suddenly call out?\nLeonel looked toward Jerach with an amused expression.\n\"What are you doing out there? Hurry up.\"\nJerach stood rooted in place for a long while.\n\"… Did I already fall into the illusion? Fuck, my life is over.\"\nLeonel laughed and shook his head.\nHe hadn't had a close friend since James betrayed him. In fact, he had very much avoided it, closing himself off slightly. But, he felt it wouldn't be bad to have someone like Jerach around, at least for now.\nLeonel waved a finger, causing a pillar of earth to shoot up from behind Jerach and send him soaring toward the house.\n\"Ah!\" Jerach grabbed onto his ass with both hands, soaring through the skies with a wronged expression on his face.\nLeonel let Jerach land before the door. No way he was going to catch something so heavy.\nBut, this seemed to wake Jerach up from his stupor.\n\"You… you really claimed this abode?\"\nLeonel smiled. \"I have some stuff to do before we go again. Just stay in here, it's safer. I'm sure there will be people surrounding this place soon enough.\"\nWith that, Leonel turned and entered, walking up to the highest room of the abode. Though he didn't know Jerach well, his actions just now were enough for Leonel to take a chance on his character.\nEven if Leonel was wrong about him, with Leonel's current abilities, he could definitely stop anyone he didn't want spying on him from doing so.\nJerach stood in a daze as Leonel disappeared.\n**\nBANG!\n\"Someone tell me what the hell just happened!\"\nWithin the Central Tower, numerous meetings just like this were taking place. As though by tacit understanding, almost all Emperors and most Kings not involved in Leonel's claiming of the Dream Abode came to this very place.\n\"P-Please calm your anger, young master. All those we've sent to investigate haven't come back. We're unsure of what happened as well.\"\n\"Dammit!\"\nThe young man in question knew that he couldn't go and investigate himself. If he did so, that would be an act of war on the Eastern Sector and he couldn't bear this burden alone.\nIt was fine if he sent middling Soldiers out to do his bidding. Who would care about a few Soldiers? They weren't enough of a threat to be taken seriously. But, if he, as a King, made a move of his own, it would definitely stir up some problems.\n\"The Dream Abode had been claimed! The Dream Abode has been claimed!\"\nAt that moment, a Soldier came sprinting into the tower, almost tripping over his own feet.\nThe entire environment froze.\nHad it been the Light or Dark Abode, it would have been shocking, but easier to accept. Had it been the Star, Space or Time Abode, the whole of Terrain would have been shaken, but it would still cool down after a while. But, for it to be the Dream Abode…\nIt felt as though everyone had entered an illusory realm of their own. Did they really hear correctly?\nReynred Solar, Jilniya Falls and Wilas Mirage all sat together, discussing this very topic. But, when they heard the news, they too came to a grinding halt. Then, they all looked toward one another and understood something immediately.\nTheir mission this time was far too important, it was so important that they even stopped personally overseeing the capture of that ugly bitch.\nFor such a variable to appear now of all times… They had to find a way to deal with it.",

      "content": "Leonel had no idea about the commotion he had caused. But, truthfully, this was a matter of choice rather than one of ignorance. All he cared about at this moment was increasing his own strength. The question laid in how he would do so.\nAt the moment, Leonel sat in the pool of his Abode Setting in a silent state of meditation. His mind rushed through several potential plans as he organized himself.\nThe quickest way to improve himself was likely with the Four Seasons Realm Force Arts of Merlin's Trials. With the improvement to his ability added atop the help of the Natural Force Art, it most definitely wouldn't take him the years he previously thought it would.\nLeonel had already done a quick estimate. It would take him about a single day to perfect Dream Sculpt one of them now. And, if he wanted to fuse his comprehensions of Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall, he felt it would take about a week or two.\nIn total, if Leonel wanted to grasp the Four Seasons Realm for his spear, bow and fists, it would take about two to three months. This was definitely a far shorter evaluation than he previously had.\nThe only unfortunate part was that these wouldn't be his own comprehensions. As such, the power he displayed wouldn't be as exaggerated as allowing him to challenge the Peak of the Fourth Dimension.\n'For someone weak, the best thing they can do to keep themselves safe would be to have mobility and to keep a certain distance.'\nLeonel knew this well. So, for now, he set aside the idea of comprehending his spear and fist techniques.\nDuring the trip here, Leonel had already completely grasped Chain Domain and conquered his first Spear Peak. There was no need to spend any more time on it for now. In fact, Leonel was leaning toward comprehending the Four Seasons Realm with his spear on his own. But, this was still a matter for the future.\n'Focus on movement and long ranged attacks.'\nWhen Leonel came to this conclusion, he had made up his mind. He was able to quickly breakdown the things he needed to do.\nThe first and most obvious was to awaken the Speed Branch of his Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor.\nThe second was to master [Golden Feather Step].\nThe third was to comprehend and fuse his comprehensions of the Four Seasons Realm for his Bow Embryo.\nAnd the fourth was to modify his use of Camelot's spell Arts to make them useful against Fourth Dimensional opponents. In the past, Leonel didn't have the computational ability to do this on his own. But, at the moment, he was feeling much more confident.\nHaving made his decision, Leonel's eyes slowly opened.\nA smile crept onto his face as he watched the little mink float in the pool. The little guy snored away without a care in the world, causing Leonel to chuckle.\nLeonel entered his Dream World once again. This time, he immediately split himself into 16 Dream Clones. Then, he assigned four to each one of his chosen tasks. As for his 17th Dream Clone, he had it completely focus on absorbing Dream Force. The only way to sustain such continuous activity would be to do exactly this.\nIf Leonel was in any other environment, he would likely have to take a break every few hours. This had happened to him during his trip here in the carriage with Heira. This was why Heira could so clearly tell when he slipped into and out of his meditative state.\nBut the Dream Abode had such a high density of Dream Force that Leonel didn't even need to worry about it. And, since he was currently within the Segmented Cube, he could allow it to slowly gain the characteristics of the Dream Abode as well.\nAt least for while Leonel was within the Fourth Dimension and Fourth Dimensional Dream Force was still helpful to him, he could enter the Abode or Lab Setting to gain the same benefits he was now.\n..\n~[Golden Feather Step] Clones~\nAfter asking the dictionary, Leonel conjured up an environment perfect for training movement within his Dream World.\nHis Dream Clones each stood atop thin metal poles barely the width of the balls of their feet. Below, there was nothing but an endless abyss.\nIn their minds, the movements of [Golden Feather Step] were replayed again and again. Each of them tried to grasp the Artistic Conception of the technique.\nLeonel had no idea that his thoughts now were far beyond a normal person's. Artistic Conception was usually a term reserved for the Universe Cycles. But, to try and paint a picture without even considering the Universe Cycles… The outcome would be quite interesting indeed.\nHowever, Leonel had always been doing this subconsciously. In the past, he had practiced [Chasing Wind] without even opening its cover… What was this if not relying on Artistic Conception?\nWhen Leonel chose [Golden Feather Step], what he chose wasn't its name or its power… he chose its feeling.\n…\n~Speed Branch Lineage Factor Clones~\nLeonel entered a deep introspection of his body, sensing the shackles the bound his blood.\nHaving access to a particular branch didn't necessarily mean that one would awaken it. However, to now, Leonel had been able to awaken the first levels of both the Healing Branch and the Wisdom Branch.\nThe first opening of the Wisdom Branch was known as Blossoming Mind. It opened up one's thoughts, increasing speed of thought and solidifying the foundation for further cultivation of the mind.\nUnfortunately, Leonel didn't gain much from this other than smoothing out his path toward the Fifth Dimension. After all, his own ability overshadowed any benefits one could gain from unlocking this first shackle.\nThe first opening of the Healing Branch was known as Instant Recovery. As long as there was an adequate separation of time, Leonel could instantly recover back to his peak state. It had already been months since the last time Leonel used this ability, but he still had a few more months to go before he could use it again.\nLuckily, this opening of this Branch had the passive ability of multiplying the impact of normal healing, something Leonel had experienced personally already during his battle with Lamorak.\nThe first opening of the Speed Branch, however, was a special case for the Snowy Star Owl. It had a slight mutation as compared to the normal Speed Branch of other Lineage Factors because it was tailored toward winged beasts.\nIt was known as First Flight.",

      "content": "Of course, Leonel wasn't going to sprout wings just by unlocking the first of his Lineage Factor's chains. Such a mutation would only occur at a much deeper level of integration.\nFirst Flight represented the invocation of the essence of the Snowy Star Owl's speed.\n~Four Seasons Clones~\nEach one of Leonel's four Dream Clones focused on a different Force Art. They floated before his main body, each capturing a different scene.\nDespite the fact Leonel had already been bestowed the Winter Legendary Skill, he still chose to comprehend it on his own again. It was then he suddenly realized something shocking.\nWhen he finally grasped Winter on his own… he realized it was different from the comprehension Merlin's Trial had bestowed to him.\n'It can't be…'\nLeonel froze for a moment.\nCompared to the comprehension Merlin's Trial had given him, the one he comprehended by Dream Sculpting was several times deeper. In fact, Leonel felt as though he could sense the essence of the Seasons as though it was his very own understanding.\nLeonel was stunned.\nWhat limited those who chose the second path of comprehension – relying on another – was that their understanding would never be as deep as the original creator. However, by Dream Sculpting these Force Arts, Leonel had integrated this understanding so deeply within himself that it almost felt like his own.\nLeonel was shocked to his core. When he realized this, he immediately consulted the dictionary. It was only after this that he finally calmed down.\n'So that's how it is…'\nLeonel learned from the dictionary that there were two things that distinguished the second and third forms of comprehension. The first was as Leonel thought: how deeply one comprehended. But, the second was how much Universal Force one could evoke.\nUniversal Force was the strength behind the Four Seasons Realm. When one comprehended one or all of the Four Seasons, it was possible to use Universal Force to increase one's strength. This was where the power of the Realm came from.\nWhen one comprehended a Universe Cycle on their own, the amount of Universal Force one could use was far greater than when one relied on someone else.\nThis essentially meant that Leonel was now in an in-between Realm. He felt as though the comprehension was his own, but the Universal Force hadn't recognized it as such.\nAs a result, the power he could evoke from the Four Seasons Realm was more than someone who comprehended it with the help of another, but less than if he had comprehended it all on his own.\nEven though this wasn't as great as Leonel had been hoping, this was still excellent news. The second form of comprehension would have just been a minor boost to his strength, but this was much, much, much more of a boon.\nLeonel's confidence grew as he once more sunk back into his meditative state.\n…\n~Mage Art Clones~\nAfter the increased strength to Leonel's ability, he found that his ability to master Force Arts had skyrocketed. Not only could he draw Mage Arts much more quickly than he had in the past, he felt that he could even freelance their symbols to a small extent.\nThough 'freelancing' lowered the strength of the Art, it once again increased the casting speed and gave Leonel much more freedom in battle.\nHowever, what Leonel needed wasn't just speed, he needed added strength.\nThere were two avenues he could travel down to accomplish this.\nThe first was the [Layering] Art. Leonel had already used this Art many times in battle. It allowed a mage to stack the same spell multiple times to increase its power.\nUnfortunately, it had its own limitations. For one, the maximum number of stacked spells for a Three Star Magus Art was three and no more. This wasn't anywhere near enough to harm a Fourth Dimensional entity.\nIn addition, the second problem was time. To layer multiple Arts, it was obviously necessary to draw each one of them individually. This would increase casting time and not be conducive to battle.\nOf course, this second problem overshadowed the fact that it would also take a lot of stamina to layer so many Arts.\nTo Leonel, the problem of time and stamina wasn't really an issue. He could cast even a Three Star Magus Art in a split second in his current state. The main issue was the limitation of the layering Art.\nIf Leonel wanted to go with this option, he would have to research into either making the layering Art better or into making his Three Star Magus Arts better compliments to it.\nHowever… Leonel felt he had a much better idea than this.\nHis four Clones sat in regions of their own, each of them having numerous Force Arts floating around them. They spanned from the simplest Apprentice Arts to the highest Magus Arts.\nEvery so often, they would breakdown into smaller parts. Anyone watching from the outside would realize that it wasn't that there were Apprentice Arts and Magus Arts floating around Leonel but rather that…\nThe Magus Arts were becoming Apprentice Arts!\nLeonel continued breaking down complex Magus Arts into their simpler forms them forming them up once again.\nHe seemed to be searching for something, looking for a path forward.\nSoon, there came a point where nothing but Apprentice Arts remained. Then…\nLeonel broke them down further.\n**\nWhile Leonel was entirely focused on training himself, a month ticked by, then a second. Leonel had unknowingly turned 19 being completely none the wiser.\nOutside the Dream Abode, the crowd continued to grow. But, if one paid attention, it would become clear that for such a large crowd, the surroundings were eerily silent. In fact, not a single person was moving as though they had all entered a trance.\nThe higher ups who sent all of their subordinates here felt a slight tinge of fear, all the legends of the Dream Abode coming back to their memories. If they weren't certain before, they were absolutely sure now that someone had claimed it.\nBut, how could they deal with someone they couldn't even approach?\nIt was only then that the crowd before the Abode grew stagnant. From afar, the sight caused many to shudder in fear.\nWhile everyone was distracted, though, changes began to occur at the Gates of Brave City once again.\nThe first period of entry for Brave City was known as the quota period. In this period, every family, City and Power would only allow a certain number of individuals to enter. This was the calmest state Brave City would be in during its active period, but it also only allowed a limited number of individuals to benefit.\nAfter this period ended, the second period would begin. During this time, restrictions would lift. But… the danger would multiply several folds.\nWhereas in the beginning, Brave City exuded a Valiant Majesty, it now seemed as though blood washed its walls. A suffocating killing intent hung around it, causing the weak to collapse and die beneath the pressure. No small number of individuals who overestimated themselves collapsed, never to breathe another breath.\nIt was when this second period began that Zilar looked toward the massive looming Gates with fists clenched and determination in his eyes. He wasn't the only one, but his will seemed to tower over the others.\nHe still remembered Leonel's words that day…\n\"Second place was never an option for me.\"\nBlood leaked from Zilar's fingers.\n'Second place isn't an option for me either!'\nHe took a firm step forward, his resolve forming a tangible shield around him.\n…\nAt that moment, approaching from the North, there was another who looked toward the bloody Gates in silence.\nThey had a back that hunched grotesquely and were shrouded in a black cloak. The scent of blood that hung around them seemed to rival even Brave City itself.\nWithout hesitation, this figure too stepped forward.",

      "content": "Leonel slowly opened his eyes, exhaling a long breath. He didn't seem to look much different than he had just a few months ago.\n'Hm…'\nLeonel passed a hand across his face. He remembered that in his youth he had always wanted a full, connecting beard. But, ever since his hair changed, he had stopped growing facial hair. He couldn't decide whether this was a good or a bad thing.\nRegardless, if his facial hair came out as difficult to cut as his bronzed hair, it might be better that he never did. As things stood now, Leonel wasn't even sure if a full force swing from Syl's elder brother's sword could cut his hair. It would probably only get worse when he entered the Perfect Stage.\nLeonel shuddered slightly, thinking about what it would mean if he had to take a blade with such force to his face.\n'Ai, what would happen if I had to kiss Aina with such tough facial hair? Would I pierce her skin? Forget it, forget it… I'll just give up on that dream…'\nJust like that, Leonel had gone from a youth who dreamt of having a full beard to one who would stay cleanly shaven for the rest of his life. Sometimes, the dream of a man could only die as he matured.\n[Author's Note: A moment of silence for our favorite MC…]\n…\nLeonel walked down the stairs of the Dream Abode. Not much had been touched in his absence, at least not on the second or third floors. It was only after he made it down to the first that he found Jerach.\n\"You're finally out!\"\nLeonel gave Jerach a weird look. It wasn't because of what he said, but because of the enthusiasm he said it with. Was there a need to look so happy?\nJerach's expression wasn't one of meeting a friend for the first time in a long time. It was more like he had just spent weeks in a bone dry desert and finally found some water. The reaction was completely disproportional to the situation.\n\"What's wrong?\" Leonel asked.\nJerach shook his head and stood up.\nAt the moment, he was no longer wearing his heavy armor and had swapped it out for some lighter clothing.\n\"I felt like I was going crazy. There's nothing to do in this house and I can't even cultivate. If I absorbed this Dream Force, I'd probably end up like all of them.\"\nJerach pointed toward the curtained windows. The sun hardly shone through them at all so it was impossible to see what was on the outside. But, clearly Jerach had taken a peak or two in the past.\nHearing Jerach's words, Leonel felt a bit bad.\nHe had brought Jerach in so that he would be safe. But, he had forgotten to consider that it would be difficult for Jerach to do much of anything here.\nWith Leonel's protection, it wasn't a problem to stay here and not fall into an illusion. In fact, even if he did, Leonel could still pull him out of it. However, other than this, he was pretty limited.\nLeonel realized then that he might have been a bit too rash. It would have definitely been better for Jerach had he gone off to claim a King Abode for himself.\n\"Wait.\" Leonel shook his head. \"What did you mean by that? Who's 'all of them'?\"\nJerach smiled bitterly. \"Check for yourself.\"\nLeonel slowly walked to the windows and pulled the curtain aside. When he saw what Jerach had already previously been aware of, he was speechless.\n\"What the hell…\"\nThere was a sea of people outside his home. Though it wasn't as exaggerated as being within the hundreds, there were definitely more than a few dozen. If such a crowd appeared in a normal suburb of Earth, it would be enough to shake any home owner.\nYet, all of these people were frozen solid, not moving a single inch or saying a single word.\n'I guess the protections of this Abode are even better than I thought… Let alone challenging it, they can't even look at it. Well, this definitely makes leaving easier.'\nLeonel smiled. He had wanted to become known all this time so that Aina would know to come find him. So, to him, all this commotion was good news.\nThough he could awaken all these people, he had no reason to do so just yet.\nWithout saying a word to Jerach, Leonel made his way to the door and swung it open.\n\"Hey, hey, hey! My armor!\"\n\"You don't need it.\" Leonel replied.\n\"You…\" Jerach felt aggrieved, but his armor wasn't something he could put on in a split moment. It was extraordinarily heavy for him.\n\"Come on. You're a wind affinity warrior, that armor is only hampering you.\"\nLeonel turned an eye toward Jerach that made the latter shudder. He felt as though Leonel had seen through him completely with that one glance.\n'How'd he change so much…?'\n\"… I… I need my armor…\" Jerach said.\nLeonel frowned. He hadn't expected Jerach to be so set on this.\n\"Fine. Forget it.\"\nJerach smiled somewhat, but it seemed forced as he hurriedly put his black armor back onto his body. It was only after he finished that he sighed a breath of relief as though he had been naked without it.\nLeonel nodded and they headed out of the door, not bothering to hide their presence much. Considering the current situation, it was already difficult enough to monitor them in the first place.\nStill, to no one's surprise, those Kings and Emperors had managed to find a loophole. If one was far enough away from the Abode, the Dream Force couldn't affect them. Realizing this, many left their scouts with special long range sensory abilities in the Central Tower to monitor the Dream Abode from afar.\nThe moment the doors swung open, they had all already been informed.\nBut, by the time those gears had gotten into motion, Leonel had already made it to his first destination.. The monument of the winged swordsman.",

      "content": "The truth was that no one knew who it was had claimed the Dream Abode. It was only after seeing Leonel exit that people finally got a look at just who this individual was.\nSo, when Leonel made it to the stone monument, not a single person spared him a glance. Of course, that was only because they didn't notice his Emperor brand immediately.\nNow that Leonel knew his becoming famous was inevitable, he put away his overinflated bravado and went back to his normal disposition. So, not many eyes were on him to begin with.\n\"Jerach, this monument is very useful for you.\" Leonel suddenly said.\n\"Huh? What?\" Jerach's eyes widened then scanned the surroundings to see if anyone was listening in on their conversation.\nLeonel chuckled. \"Don't worry, no one can hear me but you. It's just a single noise cancellation spell.\"\nLeonel had used plenty of these spells to form his maze back during Merlin's Random Event. Using it now in conversation wasn't an issue.\nThat said, Leonel found that casting the same spells in a Fourth Dimensional world had severely lowered effects. For example, a teleportation spell that would have usually carried him tens of meters would be lucky to shift him one or two meters.\nStill, for such a low level spell, it could get the job done.\nIt was only after hearing Leonel say this that Jerach sighed a breath of relief.\n\"… You're a mage? No, forget that. What do you mean this monument can help me? Is there a secret?\"\n\"Of course there is. Did you think that these monuments just stood here to tell you about how many women these Generals took back to their tents?\"\nJerach grinned. \"What better source of encouragement is there than this?\"\nLeonel seemed to have almost forgotten who he was dealing with. He almost couldn't refrain from rolling his eyes.\n\"The stories written on this monument may or may not be true, I don't know. But, what I do know is that the story isn't nearly as important as what's hidden within. You need to brace yourself and touch the monument with your Internal Sight.\"\nJerach hesitated upon hearing this.\nThe reason most didn't dare to do this was because the pressure around the monument was too great. Internal Sight seemed intangible, but it was still connected to one's mind. Under equally 'intangible' pressure, it could suffer damage and cause backlash to its owner. So, under such conditions, not many dared to even test Leonel's theory, let alone going as far as to observe the monument with it.\n\"This is something you'll have to figure out yourself.\" Leonel said. \"I've already given you all the information you need to know.\"\nLeonel sighed internally. He could tell that Jerach had a mental roadblock somewhere, but he wasn't some sort of guru, nor had he known Jerach for long enough to extend advice to him.\nMaybe to Jerach, he had already hidden it well. In truth, most wouldn't be able to pick up on it at all. The fact Leonel had was just a testament to his observational abilities.\nWith these words said, Leonel took several steps forward and entered the aura field of the stone monument. It was only after he did this that many turned a curious eye over to him.\n'An Emperor…?!'\nIt had to be known that Emperors and Kings were almost all accounted for. Gathering information on such people was usually the topmost priority of anyone within these city walls.\nFor them to not recognize such a person… Just who was he?\nThe second phase had started not long ago. Could it be that there was someone hidden within the general population with such talent?\nNo one here believed that they had really missed out on Leonel. It must be that he was new. And, if he was new, then that must be that he had entered without a quota during the second phase. And, by extension, that must be that he wasn't a part of the City Lord structure or the Powers. There was no way such a talent would be abandoned without a quota by such powers, right?\nBut… wouldn't they have also known that a new Emperor appeared? After all, there was only one Gate in their Eastern Sector…\nAs these people were trying to think about who Leonel might be, he had already crossed the five meter mark toward the stone monument, causing their eyes to almost bulge out from their sockets.\nIt was no problem for an Emperor to enter such a close range. The issue was doing it so quickly. It was as though Leonel wasn't even feeling any pressure to begin with.\nIn the blink of an eye, Leonel had already become the closest to the stone monument. Yet, he didn't stop.\nHe strolled forward, soon becoming so close to the monument that he could reach out a hand and touch it.\nBy now, even Leonel was feeling impossibly great pressure. His bones creaked and his muscles tensed. However, compared to others, he was much more leisurely for one specific reason: he felt none of the mental pressure others did.\nWith a leap, Leonel jumped toward the top of the monument.\nA green light lit the bottoms of his soles. Two more jumps later, he landed atop the tall monument.\nLeonel's body shuddered when he touched the monument. His blood seemed to roll in reverse, but his strong body withstood it.\nHe forcefully suppressed it and sat down in meditation under the astonished gazes of all those around him. It wasn't long before Leonel had completely forgotten everything in his surroundings, his mind becoming as calm as the surface of a lake.\nWho knew that the moment Leonel settled into a rhythm, a blinding pillar of red light would shoot up into the skies from the direction of the Central Tower?\nNo matter how shocked everyone was by Leonel, this red pillar took up all of their attention…\nSomeone was invading their Eastern Sector.\nThe only person who didn't seem to react to this at all was Leonel who continued to meditate. After all, he had already guessed that something like this would happen.\nA red pillar wouldn't appear for anyone at and below the Royal rank. The only explanation was that Kings and Emperors had made their move. And...\nThey were obviously coming for him.",

      "content": "Leonel's mind was filled with visions of the winged swordsman.\nIt was quite a beautiful sight to behold. Every motion was smooth and flowed into the next.\nThe flap of his wings, the intake of a breath, the swing of his sword. His steps, his Force, his thoughts… It was all in perfect union.\nThe longer Leonel watched, the deeper he dove into the world.\nHe could feel the familiar energies trying to assault his mind. But, compared to the past where he nearly died, it almost felt like something was tickling him. The capacity of his mind was simply too far beyond what it had been in the past.\nEventually, Leonel felt that he had been far too cautious.\nWithout hesitation, he began to reflect on the Natural Force Art that called his Dream World home. In that instant, he no longer felt like he was an observer. It was as though he had taken over the body of the winged swordsman. He even felt like he was a master swordsman, ruling over the world with a single blade.\nLeonel was very familiar with this feeling. Every time he began to comprehend a new spear, this was exactly the same feeling he would have.\nThe Artistic Conception engraved itself into his mind.\n'It's a much higher level of movement control compared to the primitive man…'\nLeonel's heartbeat slowly descended, reaching a calm state once more. In fact, he felt as though the pressure the stone monument had on him was lessened by several degrees.\nThe primitive man taught Leonel the value of body control. When he ran, the movement of his arms and torso were just as the important as the movement of his legs. When he used his hands to attack, the placement of his feet and the torque of his hips was just as important as the placement of his arms.\nThis was a comprehension Leonel had slowly built upon the more spear consciousnesses he absorbed.\nIf he went back now, the deficiencies of the primitive man were too many, the most blatant of which was the fact this consciousness only focused on the body but not enough on Force. However, regardless, Leonel was endlessly thankful for the foundation the primitive man gave him.\nThanks to this foundation, Leonel felt that he could grasp the mysteries of this winged swordsman with much more ease.\n'There's something I'm missing. This feeling is definitely very important to this world, but I know nothing about it. I'll have to ask the dictionary about it when I have time.'\nLeonel opened his eyes and smiled, feeling very satisfied with his gains. He didn't expect to master the secrets of this stone monument so quickly, but this was definitely a good thing. It seemed he had underestimated the benefits his ability had bestowed upon him.\nThis made Leonel even more eager to move on to the next monument.\nMuch like the primitive man was a great foundation for this winged swordsman's stone monument, Leonel felt that the primitive woman's consciousness would be a great foundation for the bowwoman's stone monument.\nLeonel still didn't know much about what Camelot called the General Star even now. But, he felt if he comprehended the bowwoman's Artistic Conception, he would come to a truer understanding of just what it meant to be a General Star.\nLeonel hopped down from the stone monument and walked toward Jerach, completely ignoring all the gazes around him.\n\"Jerach, you stay here. I'll be going to another stone monument.\"\n\"Uh…\" Jerach didn't know how to respond. Before he could say anything, Leonel had already vanished into the distance.\n**\nUnfortunately for those who had come to learn more about the person who claimed the Dream Abode, they had run into a bit of a… sticky situation.\nJust when they wanted to charge into the Eastern Sector, they found a white robed young man in their way.\nThe young man didn't say much. He simply stood there, his aura calm. Despite the fact there were several Kings before him, he didn't say a single word. It was as though these Kings really weren't worth much of anything to him.\nThe Kings froze when they saw such a scene.\n\"Anared, what do you mean by this?\"\nOne of the Kings narrowed his eyes. Clearly, he recognized this white robes young man. In fact, if Leonel had been there, he too would recognize this young man as none other than Syl's elder brother.\n\"What do I mean?\" Anared's expression remained placid. \"You're invading my Sector yet have the face to ask that?\"\n\"Stop twisting the facts, Anared. You know exactly why we're here!\"\n\"Oh? And I'm supposed to just allow you through to satisfy your own curiosity? And then what? There's only me here yet so many of you, I'm just supposed to take your word that you'll take a look and then leave? Do you take me for an ignorant fool?\"\nThe expression of the Kings flickered.\nEven if their main purpose here was to find out who owned the Dream Abode, there was no way that some of the more sinister among them hadn't thought of taking advantage of the situation.\nAfter so many of them flooded into the Eastern Sector, how could they possibly defend against them all? There were bound to be numerous benefits.\nAt that same time, Anared's words spoke to something else.\nBefore, Leonel had asked Anared if there really were so many Emperors after seeing the state of the number of lit lampposts. Back then, Anared had simply answered that there was no restriction to the number of Abodes a single Emperor could claim.\nBut, what Leonel hadn't realized back then was that… there was only ever Anared. There were no other Emperors in the Eastern Sector but Leonel himself!\n\"Fine. They won't enter then. But what about us?\"\nAt that moment, Anared's expressionless visage became a hint more serious.\nThe Emperor level characters had made themselves known.",

      "content": "Reynred stepped forward, the crowd of Kings splitting for him.\nHe wore the same black robes accented with deep blue soft armor. He was a young man of charming looks and a somewhat dark gaze. And, unlike in the past, he wasn't followed by either Jilniya nor Wilas of World's End Falls and Mirage Pavilion respectively. That said, he hadn't come alone either.\nHe was followed by another pair of woman and man. Though, unlike Wilas and Jilniya who couldn't have been more different from one another, this pair looked strikingly similar. At a glance, it was easy to make out that they were siblings, fraternal twins, in fact.\nThis pair of twins walked side by side, their shoulders practically rubbing against one another. And, judging by their demeanor, they most definitely weren't subordinated to Reynred either.\nAt the end of the first phase, there had been seven Emperors total. Leonel, Anred, Reynred, Jilniya, Wilas and… these twins.\n'The Moon siblings…'\nFor two Emperor level talents to appear in just one family, one could imagine the luck it would take. And most could only do exactly that: imagine.\nThe Moon family, however, didn't have to do this. They birthed a brother-sister pair just forty or so years ago that carried the hope of their future.\nSince this was a family, it was no surprise that they were a part of the City Lord power structure and founded their strength upon governance and commerce. However, Anared and the rest of the Keafir family had known for a long time that the Moon family had been leaning toward the Powers for a long time already.\nStill, this situation likely had little to do with their affiliations. They were most likely just as curious as everyone else who this mysterious person who managed to claim the Dream Abode was.\nThe truth was that even Anared only had a good idea of who it was. After all, as far as he was aware, there was only one other Emperor. However, he had yet to confirm it, mostly because he too didn't dare to casually approach that Abode.\nThat said, that appearance of this person coincided with that young man's disappearance.\n\"Fine. If it's only you three, I can accept it.\" Anared replied calmly. \"However, if any others try to take advantage of the situation, don't blame me for being rude.\"\nThe sword that floated to Anared's back vibrated wildly as though thirsting for blood. Beneath his might, several Kings paled, unable to gather up the courage to battle.\nThe sister Moon sibling smiled. Her lips were such a bright shade of red that it seemed she had just been sipping blood from a wine glass.\n\"Lead the way.\"\nHer voice was so sweet it almost made one forget the tension in the atmosphere.\nEveryone here was intelligent. It was obvious that if Anared had a choice, he wouldn't allow any of them through no matter whether the number was small or not.\nAs Emperors, they had all participated in the Brave City trial before, so they knew what kind of advantages a successful invasion could give. Under normal circumstances, no one would ever give an enemy even an inkling of a chance at gaining an advantage.\nHowever, whether it was because he felt he couldn't face so many enemies or whether he wanted to conserve his strength, Anared didn't want to set off the sparks of war just yet, at least not until the third phase.\nAnared turned and started leading the three of them toward the Emperor Abodes. But, before he could get very far, he heard another familiar giggle.\n\"Young Heir Keafir, you don't need to insult our intelligence like this, right? You're going in the wrong direction.\"\nThe sister Moon sibling spoke again, her voice light and airy. It somehow both made one comfortable and cold at the same time.\nAnared's step paused. \"Since you know where he is, point me in the right direction.\"\nHis voice didn't give way to any embarrassment. He really didn't know where Leonel was. But, the three Emperors who followed him shared a 'knowing' glance.\nWith the strength of these four Emperors, it wasn't a surprise that they didn't take long to find Leonel. However, when Anared's gaze landed on him, his pupils couldn't help but constrict.\nAt that moment, Leonel was the center of everyone's attention. He sat atop yet another stone monument, completely lost in his own world. Compared to other, his Emperor brand seemed particularly dazzling, obscuring the black monitoring mark that was once the centerpiece of his face.\nEven when everyone was shocked by the sudden appearance of four more Emperors, Leonel was unmoved. Or, rather, it was more accurate to say that he didn't spare any of his thoughts toward them. Though he knew four more individuals had appeared, he didn't stop his meditation.\nReynred and the twins were stunned for a moment.\n\"Third Dimension?\"\nThe sister Moon sibling's words were just as gentle on the ears as usual. However, this time, rather than just being calming and cold, it felt as though a bomb had erupted amidst the crowd.\n\"Do you know who he is?\" Reynred looked toward the Keafir family Heir.\nAnared sent a noncommittal glance over. \"He's the seeded participant of my Keafir family. He is courting my younger sister.\"\nThe three Emperors froze.\nHowever, it was then they remembered. There was an Emperor that entered the Eastern Sector during the first phase. The commotion that young man caused was not small. In fact, the whole city quaked.\nUnfortunately, since then, no one had heard from the young man at all. And, this young man had also ignored the unspoken rules and had yet to visit the Central Tower. Over time, there had been so many things to deal with that this young man floated to the backs of their mind.\nReynred frowned as he observed Leonel. This made things even more troublesome.\nThe good news was that this Emperor was still in the Third Dimension, this wasn't much to worry about. But, there were certain things during the trial that wouldn't strictly rely on strength. In addition, he wouldn't be easy to deal with regardless thanks to Anared's protection.\n\"Wait..\" Reynred's eyes narrowed. \"… Isn't that a monitoring brand? Why does your seeded participant have such a thing?\"\nIt was difficult to spot beneath the Emperor brand. But, after noticing it, it was hard to unsee it.\nHowever, Anared's response was just as cool and collected.\n\"Is there a rule that said someone who's branded can't participate? You know as well as I do that this brand only means he is being monitored, not that he is a criminal. In addition, it will only be for a period of three years.\"\n\"That isn't what I meant.\" Reynred responded. \"Why would someone of your family be under suspicion? And, why is it that I didn't know that your family had recruited such a genius?\"\n\"Is there a need for you to know everything about my family?\" Anared gaze sharpened in warning.\n\"Alright, alright.\" The sister Moon sibling got between the two. \"We only came here to form relationships, not break them. Can't we just have a conversation with him? What do you say young man, will you come down?\"\nThe final part of her words were aimed at Leonel. On Terrain, no matter what man heard a request from such a beautiful lady, they would likely do their best to please. However, despite the words traveling to Leonel's ears, he didn't react.\nHow rude was it to ask someone in the middle of meditation to come down and talk for your own convenience? Had Leonel not been able to split his mind, the act of the Moon sister sending her voice toward him like this could have caused him to suffer backlash.\nAn awkward silence fell over the stone monument region as Leonel continued to meditate.\nAt that moment, the ever-silent brother Moon sibling suddenly opened his eyes, a murderous glint lighting them.",

      "content": "Even among those of Terrain, the Moon siblings stood out.\nThey had flowing silver hair, overly pale skin, and a pair of red lips that seemed to drip of blood. If Leonel cared to observe them during the critical juncture of his comprehension, he would definitely assume them to be the vampires of legend and give himself a good chuckle.\nThat said, seemingly going with this theme, when the brother Moon sibling opened his eyes, the murderous aura seemed to be perfectly in line with this. It seemed that even compared to Anared, he was that much more protective of his own sister.\nJust when he was about to make a moon, his sister pinched the sleeves of his silver robes.\nThe brother Moon sibling looked toward her, wondering why it was he was stopped. There was nothing he hated more than this. Had it not been for the fact they were family, maybe this would have been enough for him to lash out.\nHowever, his sister didn't explain. She simply looked toward Leonel, the smile on her face not fading in the least.\n'Brother can't even approach the stone monument so closely. It's not a matter of not being physically capable, but rather a limitation of our minds. If brother really attacked now, he would be at a great disadvantage almost immediately. It seems that this man was already aware of this.'\nThis made everything more complicated. Despite being out in the open, Leonel was probably in the safest place he could be with the exception of his own Abode.\nAt that moment, a group came rushing in, seemingly finding out about all the commotion.\n\"Big Brother!\" Syl's voice rang out from amidst them. But, before she could say more, she was stunned silent by the sight of Leonel and three other Emperors.\nThe other seeded participants of the Keafir family rushed in after her. Though they were here to participate, another one of their tasks was to protect the young family miss whenever they could.\nThey had had their hands full over the last few days trying to keep Syl away from the Dream Abode. But this time, they couldn't stop her at all.\nAnared swept a glance over them that made them shudder. They knew he was reprimanding them for failing their task to keep her away.\n\"Come here, Syl.\" Anared said somewhat coldly. He felt safer when his sister was right by his side.\nAt that moment, the situation suddenly changed.\nEveryone's gaze unexpectedly shot away from Leonel and toward the Eastern Sector Gates.\nSomeone was crossing the second phase trial?\nThough it was true that Leonel's actions were a far greater rarity, someone passing the second phase was definitely a major event as well.\nThey all watched as the Gates trembled. They could sense the perseverance of the person on the other side. One could imagine the hardship one needed to face to cross the bloody aura of the second phase.\nIt took several moments, but eventually, the smallest Soldier doors shook open, cracking open just a fraction.\nA figure squeezed through, his appearance disheveled and bloody.\nBut, that was when something heart wrenching occurred.\nJust when the figure was almost all the way through, the doors slammed shut, catching the ankle of their right foot.\nAn agonizing scream shook the Eastern Sector as the person collapsed onto the dirt roads of Brave City. Blood pooled at their legs, dying the ground a harsh crimson as the figure convulsed.\nThe amount of perseverance it took to cross the barrier of aura was astronomical. It was no surprise that this person had no energy left. To deal with such an injury at such a time…\nEveryone was stunned. But, they couldn't have expected for the silent, unmoving Leonel to suddenly awaken at that moment.\nSeeing the situation, Leonel stood, his body shooting forward.\nIn that moment, if one wasn't looking closely, it would feel as though a bird had just soared over their heads. The pupils of the four Emperors all constricted at once.\nThe bowwoman's stone monument was quite close to the Gates. And, due to the fact that all the Abodes in this region were just various sized tents, there was nothing obstructing their view right to them.\nIn what felt like an instant, Leonel appeared beside this person.\n\"Zilar…\" Leonel mumbled.\nAt that moment, the familiar face shook on the ground. He seemed to have gone into shock.\nAs a warrior of the Fourth Dimension, such an injury should have been painful, but definitely not to the point of putting him into such a state. The only explanation was that Zilar had given his everything to reach this point, he didn't have any more energy left to give.\nLeonel's body suddenly burst with a blinding golden light.\nLight Elemental Force surged toward him from all sides. For a moment, his flowing bronze-gold hair made him look as though he was a was deity.\nEven compared to the past, calling upon the Light Element was far easier for Leonel. In fact, he felt the difference was easily tens of times. Part of this was because of the strengthening of his mind, but maybe the most important part was his Innate Force Node.\n\"[Grand Heal].\"\nA surging wind shook the surroundings.\nIf one looked closely, it was possible to see that in addition to the main Force Art, countless smaller ones hovered around Leonel, feeding into the main Force Art as though playing an important supporting role.\nUnder the stunned gazes of everyone, Zilar's shivering slowly came to a stop. And then… His severed leg began to slowly reform itself.\nThough it failed to regrow in a single attempt, Leonel cast [Grand Heal] again before coming to a stop. He knew he could continue, but this was enough to stabilize Zilar's situation for now. If he really did continue, he would drain his stamina and then he wouldn't be able to guarantee his own safety, let alone Zilar's.\nLeonel felt somewhat guilty for his current situation, so, of course he would do his best to help.\nLeonel propped the unconscious Zilar up, piggy backing him. Though the little mink was a bit unsatisfied with its sleeping arrangements being disrupted, it clamored up to the top of Leonel's head and made another bed for itself.\nWith that, Leonel began to walk back, his hands clasped under Zilar's thighs.\nHowever, it was a given that those Emperors wouldn't just allow him to walk back to his Abode. How could they give up this opportunity?\nGetting over her shock, the sister Moon sibling stepped forward.\n\"So, are you free to speak now?\"",

      "content": "Leonel's steps paused.\nHe really didn't know what these people wanted to 'talk' about. It seemed more to him that they wanted to find an excuse to do something to him. However, Leonel didn't care about any of this.\nHe gave the sister Moon sibling a dazzling smile. It was so genuine and light that it made her heart stop for a brief moment.\n\"My name is Leonel Morales. I am a citizen of Earth. This brand on my forehead is an unfortunate circumstance, I just got unlucky in coming here during a period of time they were monitoring for fugitives. I'm sure as citizens of Terrain, you know more about this than I do.\"\nLeonel thought to himself for another few moments.\n\"I believe that is all. Make sure to spread that far and wide.\"\nLeonel didn't speak particularly loudly, but his voice resonated, reaching the ears of all those within the square.\nThe atmosphere seemed to freeze.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. Did he say something wrong? It can't be that racism is a thing in these places? No, that shouldn't be it, Leonel saw plenty of people from other worlds coming to Terrain. If they weren't alright with such a thing, why would they make it such a big staple of their culture?\nThe four Emperors were shaken once again.\nLeonel was filled with too many surprises.\nClaiming the Dream Abode was already enough to shake them to the core. Having a Light Elemental affinity so high on top of that was enough to make them green with envy despite how well they tried to hide it.\nBut, even compared to all of this, the name Earth seemed to shake them all the more.\nFeelings of jealousy, animosity and disdain swirled in the air. This wasn't a matter of nationality or racism, as odd as it seemed to say this after describing such vitriol.\nEarth and Terrain seemed to be on two opposing sides of the spectrum. While the common citizens had never heard of Earth, the elites of Terrain all had.\nTerrain was reaching the end of its growth potential, Earth had an endlessly paved road before it. Terrain didn't receive the support of higher level worlds, Earth received the support of countless. Terrain was entering a crossroads that might end their world as they once knew it… and Earth was just beginning to bud.\nThe more one compared, the more striking the differences became.\n\"… Did you just say Earth?\" Reynred's gaze narrowed.\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. \"Yes?\"\nReynred's gaze narrowed even further before looking toward Anared.\n\"Is this how your Keafir family operates now? Allowing those of other worlds to partake in our resources?\"\nA slight hint of animosity hung in the air. Regardless of what side you were on, the idea of someone stealing away something that was rightfully yours wouldn't sit well with you. It only made it worse that Leonel was in the Third Dimension.\nThose who wanted to partake in the Brave City trials but weren't part of the major powers of Terrain had to wait to the second phase. But, who would believe that someone in the Third Dimension could do this?\nThe contrast Zilar provided was too drastic.\nEveryone could tell that Zilar was strong enough to become a Royal at worst. Yet, he was branded as a soldier now and had no choice but to abide by the rules of a soldier.\nIf Leonel had gone through the second phase like he was supposed to, it would have been impossible for him to become an Emperor and all the more impossible for him to claim the Dream Abode and put them in such a passive position.\nAnared's gaze remained indifferent.\n\"The matters of the Keafir family are ours to deal with alone, since when was it the turn of the Cliff's Edge Terrace to speak on our matters? And, I'm also certain that if one were to pick out a traitor to our world… It most definitely wouldn't be me.\"\nReynred's glare froze. Clearly, he hadn't expected such pointed words from Anared.\nAll the while, Leonel was lost in his own thoughts.\n'Hm… If I go back and pass the trial of the second phase, my name would spread far and wide, right? Aina might hear about it…'\nLeonel thought for a moment. With his intelligence, he could immediately see the animosity aimed toward him. And, when he noticed the glances toward Zilar on his back, he managed to put it all together himself.\nJust when Leonel planned on acting on this though, he paused and grinned.\n'Hate moves more than anything else.'\n\"Last I remembered, you're an Emperor too, correct?\" Leonel looked toward Reynred with a childishly innocent gaze. \"If you want my Abode, go claim it.\"\nSuddenly, Leonel's warm smiling face became extremely punchable.\n\"In fact, I think I'm in the mood to claim more abodes. I'll be taking over the Star, Light and Darkness Abode. After I do, you can feel free to challenge any one of them.\" Leonel pondered on something for a moment. \"Now that I think about it, don't you also get some benefits for challenging an Abode in enemy territory? You should want to, too. Right?\"\nLeonel's smile never faded despite sensing the animosity in the air.\nAnared's brows furrowed, not quite understanding what Leonel was trying to do. Was he really just so arrogant?\n\"You don't believe me?\" Leonel blinked innocently.\nThe crowd was riled up. They wanted to see nothing more than Leonel falling flat on his face. But, at the same time, they wanted to beat him up where he stood. The conflicting feelings left them feeling so stifled that several almost coughed up blood.\nJust as Leonel was about to boldly lead everyone to the elite Abodes, the city shook once again.\nEveryone's gaze shot toward the Northern Gates as they blasted open, causing the whole city to quake.\nAs though this was a catalyst, the Central Tower flickered.\nA mass of energy converged toward the peak of the Tower. At first, the form they took was blurry, but it soon became a row of numbers that read:\n9:23:59:59\nA countdown to the third phase had begun.\nIn that moment, the suffocating aura around Brave City began to slowly weaken and anxious soon-to-be spectators excitedly stood.. It seemed that the true Trials would be starting soon.",

      "content": "Leonel placed Zilar down on a bed within his Dream Abode.\nHis gaze flashed with a cold light. If it hadn't been for Syl's elder brother, he probably would have had to find his way out of that encirclement.\nIf it was because of his own words, Leonel wouldn't mind. Plus, since he dared to step out of this Abode, he also had adequate preparations at the ready. However, Leonel knew that it wasn't so simple.\nAll along the way, the sister Moon sibling was steering the crowd with her words. She was quite a dangerous woman indeed.\nIn the end, it was due to the commotion at the Northern Gate and Leonel's own sharpness that Reynred and the twins could only leave without accomplishing much of anything. It seemed that the start of the third phase was unlike the first two.\nWhoever it was who opened the Northern Gates was definitely a future calamity they needed to prepare for. As difficult as it was to become an Emperor during the first phase, it was tens of times more difficult to do so during the second phase.\nIn addition, this person was a true Fourth Dimensional entity unlike Leonel who had only broken through in one aspect. So, compared to the danger Leonel posed, this person was a much greater threat.\n'There's not much time left… I hear the third phase has spectators, hopefully Aina is among them.'\nLeonel's coldness vanished into a genuine smile.\nDuring Leonel's life, Aina had only come to watch him play football once. The fact she went at all was definitely a big change for her. Usually, she avoided events like that like the plague. Just the simple action alone warmed Leonel's heart.\nTruthfully, back then, all the events that happened left him so shell shocked that he forgot that simple fact. That was right… she had come to watch him.\nLeonel's smile became a grin. To anyone observing from afar, he looked like a lovestruck fool.\n\"Hey little guy.\"\nLeonel scooped the little mink off the top of his head, stroking the little one's soft fur.\n\"I know you've wanted to go to that Abode for a long time. Go ahead and breakthrough.\"\nLittle Blackstar sat up excitedly and suddenly vanished from Leonel's arms.\nLeonel chuckled. If that little guy really managed to breakthrough, who knew how much trouble he'd get into.\nWhen Leonel met Little Blackstar, the little mink was an Elite S-grade threat. They had done a lot of growing together since then. Though Leonel wasn't exactly sure how the cultivation of beasts worked, he trusted the little guy could make his own way forward. This was the advantage the universe gave to beasts, anyway.\nLeonel took a deep breath and casted a few more [Grand Heal]'s on Zilar. Regrowing a limb was definitely much more difficult than he had thought it would be, and that was even with his vastly improved [Grand Heal].\nOf course, part of the reason was because Zilar was in the Fourth Dimension. But, luckily, it was just a foot and not his entire leg that had been taken out.\n\"Leo! Let me in!\"\nAt that moment, Leonel suddenly heard a distant voice. He cast a glance out of the window to find Jerach yelling at him from hundreds of meters away. It was clear the bald young man was still too scared to approach the Dream Abode of his own accord.\nLeonel allowed Zilar to continue resting before letting Jerach in. He too had some questions to ask the Black family Heir.\n\"Did you hear? An Emperor of the second phase appeared! That hasn't happened before!\"\nJerach boisterously strolled in, his face filled with awe.\n\"The third phase is probably going to be wild. I didn't participate last time, but I'm definitely going to make a name for myself this time around.\"\n\"Jerach.\" Leonel cut the young Heir off before he could continue his spiel.\nSeemingly sensing Leonel's seriousness, Jerach frowned and turned back.\n\"What is it?\"\nLeonel looked toward Jerach deeply, causing the latter to feel no small amount of discomfort.\n\"What do you think of Earth?\" Leonel suddenly spoke.\n\"Ah…\"\nJerach froze, clearly not expecting this line of questioning. His eyes darted around as though trying to find a crutch to lean on, maybe a joke to ease the mood, but all he found was bland, neatly ordered black and white furniture.\nLeonel's eyes narrowed. It seemed he was right. There was definitely more to this.\n\"Tell me.\" Leonel pressed.\n\"I…\"\nLeonel frowned. After a while he shook his head.\n\"If you don't want to answer, that's fine.\"\nLeonel turned and walked away. But, he never made a move to close the door to the Abode he had just let Jerach through. His meaning was quite clear.\nSomeone who signed their life away should act as such. If Jerach was unwilling to act as he should, then that only mean he didn't take this matter as seriously as Leonel once thought. And, since he didn't, that meant his character wasn't as Leonel previously deduced either.\nLeonel could tell that whatever Jerach knew was quite important. In fact, it should be to the point that he valued this information even more than his own life.\nThat was fine. Leonel never planned to kill him in the first place, but he had already had one person who placed certain things above their friendship with him before. And, in such a dangerous place, within an unknown world, Leonel didn't feel like putting his life in the hands of another such person again.\nJerach stood stunned, not quite knowing what to do. He, quite frankly, felt like a bride that had been abandoned at the alter.\nSuch a joke would be enough to make him laugh at any other time, but he didn't find it funny in the least right now.\nAs Jerach was hesitating, he suddenly felt his mind growing hazy. He immediately realized that this was the Dream Force beginning to encroach on his consciousness. Whatever protections Leonel had left for him were beginning to vanish.\nIn a slight panic, Jerach quickly left through the door, a slight discomfort in his chest.\nThis time, he had two reasons he didn't dare to look back toward that Abode.",

      "content": "Leonel didn't spare any more thoughts toward Jerach. He didn't feel that it was a shame nor did he feel any sense of self pity. He was already focusing on another task already. This was just the kind of person Leonel was.\nAt most, Leonel was now certain that there was something important about his home world he needed to find out on this planet. Though he didn't know exactly what it was, he would be able to find out.\nBut, first…\nLeonel locked himself into the same top floor room of his Abode. He split one portion of his mind to monitor Zilar's situation and another to make sure that the little mink was alright, then he prepared to enter the Lab Setting.\nJust as he was doing so, his lip curled as he sensed a fiery pillar of darkness shoot into the skies as the little mink claimed an abode of his own.\nOf course, this was done through the little guy's connection with Leonel. So, technically, it was Leonel claiming another. But, it brought a smile to Leonel's face regardless before he once again became serious.\nHe didn't care about what commotion this would cause, he had something much more important in mind.\nNow that he had broken into the Fourth Dimension with his Spirit Pressure, he could search Aliard's mind without worrying about the consequences.\nLeonel entered the Lab Setting and brought out the snowglobe that held Aliard. With a thought, the mental mage appeared, still shackled by illusory chains.\nAliard coughed violently, his gaze showing hints of confusion as he looked around.\nWhen he looked up and saw Leonel standing above him, a hint of rage and trepidation could be seen in his eyes.\nOver this period of time, Leonel had been allowing the Suspended Animation ability of the Segmented Cube to slowly heal Aliard. So, compared to the manic state the mental mage had been in before, he was much better now.\nOf course, Leonel had no idea how rare treasures that could heal mental injuries were. If he did, he would know that he had taken the Segmented Cube for granted once more.\nThat said, Leonel hadn't done this for Aliard's sake but rather his own. The more whole Aliard's memories were, the easier things would be on him. If he was picking through memory fragments, it would be a pain and maybe even difficult to piece together the true story.\nLeonel didn't spare any words for Aliard. He found it to be a waste of his time. So, without hesitation, he activated [Mind Search].\nAliard's eyes widened before a sinister light shone in his eyes. He thought that Leonel was foolish trying to use such a technique on a mental mage like him. He almost salivated at the thought of turning Leonel into a mindless slave.\nBut, when he felt the strength of Leonel's Spirit Pressure, he paled.\nHow was this the strength of someone in the Third Dimension? It was impossible!\nIt was then he thought of a shocking possibility.\n\"It can't be.. you can't have…!\"\nAliard knew things that the others of Camelot had not. After all, he wasn't a part of the original legend, he had been sent in by his organization to infiltrate and capture the core treasure.\nBut, it was precisely because of this that he was shocked.\nEveryone knew that it was impossible to break into the Fourth Dimension with the mind unless the body was strong enough. Doing so without a solid foundation would lead to one imploding in on themselves.\nYet, Leonel's body was definitely still within the Third Dimension. In addition, the Force that circulated his body was also considered to be within the Third. It shouldn't have been possible to do this unless…\nUnless Leonel had an ability or a Lineage Factor that allowed him to circumvent these rules.\nUnfortunately for Aliard, Leonel had not just one of these things, but both.\nAliard fell into despair as he felt his memories being eaten away at. No matter how hard he fought back, Leonel's mind was like a violent swarm.\n[Mind Search] was a truly sinister technique. A more accurate title would most definitely be [Mind Swallow].\nTo say that one was searching was completely inaccurate. The truth of what Leonel was doing was ingesting all the memories that were useful to him and discarding all those that weren't.\nDue to the style of the technique, Leonel had to build a bridge between his mind and Aliard's. This meant that when he found a memory to be useless, rather than it remaining with Aliard, it dissipated along the bridge, leaving Aliard with nothing.\nIf the two of their minds have been of similar strength, this bridge would cause a tug of war to erupt. However, Leonel's mind was so much stronger than Aliard's that it was nothing but child's play.\nAliard's helplessness soon became dullness, then was replaced by a complete vacancy as he fell over, drool leaking from the side of his mouth.\nLeonel didn't spare the brain-dead man a single glance. He closed his eyes, organizing and sifting through everything he had just learned.\nThe first thing he realized was that Aliard didn't know much. However, this much was to be expected, he should have been fairly low on the totem pole. Still, for an organization that just expected Leonel to hand over all evidence of their crimes, they didn't take many precautions either.\nFinally, Leonel learned of the name of the organization he was dealing with. The name that so many avoided speaking of.\nShield Cross Stars.\nIt was only now Leonel understood how unlucky he was. This so-called Shield Cross Stars organization was actually a police force of the universe. Its duty was to protect the safety and humanitarian rights of beasts and humanoids across the worlds.\nThe main issue here was that Leonel had never expected that the same organization he had slighted by not handing in evidence of their wrongdoing was the very same organization that happened to brand him as a fugitive worth monitoring.\nWas it just a coincidence? Or had they targeted him on purpose?\nFrom Leonel's analysis, he was fairly certain that it truly was a coincidence. But, if he was correct, just how unlucky was he? Now, an organization that had it out for him also knew his location at all times?\n\"… Fuck.\"\nLeonel stood, his jaw becoming steely.\nHe wasn't safe here. He had to find a way back to Earth as quickly as possible. Since there wasn't a branch of SCS there just yet, it would be more difficult for them to cause problems for him.\nThe issue was… how?\nEntering another Zone would be difficult. Using teleportation platforms was probably another no go…\n'I'll find Aina first then think of what to do…' Leonel sighed.\nHe felt as though a guillotine was hanging over his head. However, at least he was aware of its existence now. Not only this, but he had become aware of many other things…\n**\nThe days quickly flew by. Soon, Leonel would have no choice but to join everyone else within the Central Tower.\nThat morning, with just a few hours left until the timer would hit zero, a shadowy figure slowly stalked toward the Central Tower.\nA prominent hunched back was the first thing anyone caught sight of. As for the rest, it was shrouded in black.\nBy now, everyone knew that this was the Sword Monstress, the very woman who caused the commotion at the Northern Gate.",

      "content": "The Sword Montress' steps were light. It was almost impossible to accept that her figure was so large yet so nimble.\nFrom the third phase onward, all of the trials would begin with the Central Tower as the centerpiece. As a result, the population of people flowing into it was quite large to begin with. So, it was no surprise that such an… odd figure stood out right from the very beginning.\nOf course, there was no lack of odd individuals. However, from the very beginning, most eyes had been focused toward the Northern Sector's entry gates. For such a figure to come from this specific region immediately caught the attention of many.\nDespite the fact those tasked with observing the Northern Sector had their own speculations, they didn't dare to confirm it themselves. If they were correct, this person was the only Emperor to be birthed from the second phase since Brave City appeared on Terrain. This wasn't a person they could afford to offend.\nThough they couldn't see what was beneath the hood, this only made this person more fear inducing. They didn't want to get mixed up in anything far beyond themselves and lose their lives for a ridiculous reason.\nLike this, several backed off after the Sword Monstress appeared, rushing off to their superiors with their conjectures.\nThe Sword Monstress continued to walk forward as though nothing had changed.\nThe Central Tower was one of many floors and was the only structure in Brave City that could rival the walls in height. At the same time, it was also an incredibly wide structure despite the fact it was definitely much taller than it was so. This design left one feeling as though one had stepped into an all new world after entering just the first floor.\nThe first floor of the tower was expansive and incredibly bland. It acted as nothing more than a conduit to help the flow of people reach the places they wanted to go.\nThere were no stairs nor any elevators like one would see on Earth. Rather, there were elevated pads with queues of people. Each had a miniature teleportation station that would take one to a given floor.\nDuring the first and second phase, the Tower was nothing more than a restaurant. With enough status, one could reach the top floor and gain access to delicacies the likes of which the world of Terrain rarely saw.\nIt was unfortunate that Leonel wasn't aware of this or he may very well have taken advantage. He had long since become tired of his usual bland diet of meat and more meat.\nOf course, this was also mostly due to his own laziness. He had obtained many delicious fruits and vegetables from the underground garden he found within the hive. But, he kept them all within the snowglobes rather than properly fostering them. After all, he was a Force Crafter, not a gardener.\nAt this moment, though, not a single person was traveling to higher floors. Even if one wanted to, the teleportation pads were out of commission.\nThose who were aware of the changes that happened as the third phase approached weren't surprised. This was simply the Tower preparing itself for its true purpose.\n\"Hey, are you the Emperor from the Northern Sector? Let me see the brand on your forehead.\"\nThe once bustling Tower suddenly fell into silence.\nThe voice that had called out was booming. It had enough forcefulness to it to directly suppress the voices of everyone else. Of course, this was because no one else was trying to speak over the crowd at the same time, or else this matter wouldn't have been so easy.\nEveryone's attention oscillated between the Emperor who had spoken and the black figure that had been targeted.\nThere were very few Emperors in Brave City to begin with. So, everyone immediately recognized the original speaker as Wilas Mirage, the young Heir to the Mirage Pavilion.\nHe had a rotund body, yet his charms were also somewhat feminine. Of course, the red robes accented with violet soft armor didn't help him escape this image very well.\nIt couldn't be helped. The Heir to the Mirage Pavilion was rarely a man. In fact, this was only the second time in their history that such a thing had happened.\nThis said, no one looked down on this chubby, feminine man. So, when the black figure didn't bother to respond, the tension in the air grew palpable.\nWilas' gaze narrowed. His cheeks squeezed, almost covering his eyes completely.\nWilas suddenly chuckled, his body moving forward slowly.\nReynred and Jilniya, who had been by his side, didn't say anything as they watched him. The third phase had yet to begin, so they were still under the rules of the second phase. There was no rules against battle outside of trials just yet. In addition, even if there were, they would still support Wilas' actions at this moment.\nThe best way to learn about such a mysterious figure would be to test them personally.\nAs Heirs to Powers, they didn't believe that some unknown could be better than them. In their minds, if they were born from lesser families and didn't receive quotas, they too could become Emperors through the second phase.\nWhether that was actually true or not was still up for debate. But, all that mattered was that they believed it.\nThe shadowy figure didn't move in the slightest. Her hulking figure seemed unperturbed by Wilas' looming threat, even as the young Heir's footsteps echoed through the floor.\nIn a corner, Syl and Anared watched on in silence. They didn't have any particular horse in this race, so they too were just spectating just like everyone else.\n\"Big Brother, do you recognize that person?\"\nAnared's gaze narrowed slightly, but in the end he shook his head.\n\"No. I don't.\"\nSyl's lovely eyes blinked with an innocent curiosity. It seemed that the legend of the Sword Montress hadn't spread very wide just yet. But, this made quite some sense. After all, one of the reasons the Sword Monstress was able to make it here was because the influx of people migrating toward Brave City made it difficult to pick out individuals.\nAt that moment, Wilas made it to within three meters of the shadowy figure before stopping.\nIf before everyone was already avoiding this person, they were now giving the figure an even wider berth.. No one had any interest in getting caught up in this drama.",

      "content": "Wilas opened his mouth to speak once more, but…\nBANG!\nA heavy sword swung from the Sword Monstress' back, landing on the stones grounds of the tower's floors.\nDespite the heft of the sword, not a single mark was left behind. But no one doubted the strength of the Sword Monstress due to this.\nThe broad sword vibrated wildly upon impact as though looking to launch itself out from the hands of the Sword Monstress as she faced Wilas.\nWhen the sword appeared, Jilniya's gaze narrowed.\nWilas stood just under three meters before the Sword Monstress. But, due to the outrageous length of the massive sword, it clanged before him, just a mere foot or two away. In fact, it seemed to be aimed between his legs, leaving him feeling a slight chill.\nHowever, what Wilas felt wasn't fear. The process had been slow enough for him to witness the start to the end without issue. To a warrior on his level, it hadn't been a problem to see it all. The issue was that… his heart still felt a slight trepidation.\nIt was a warning.\nWilas, though, had every intention of lashing out. Not only was it important for them to know the limits of this figure, but it was also a matter of his face. Where would he put it if he were to back off now? Especially since he was the one who started all of this.\n\"It seems that --.\"\nJust when Wilas wanted to say more, he suddenly sensed a figure appear by his side.\nThe contrast between this figure and the hulking, black robed figure before them was too striking.\nJilniya was a goddess in the eyes of many. She had a small, soft waist, flowing black hair, and a flawless complexion that seemed sculpted by the hands of a master. Though she was lacking in comparison to Heira, this seemed to be due to lack of a mature and refined temperament rather than a shortcoming of her own looks.\nAll of this alone would have been enough to capture many hearts. But, the way her white robes hung to her curves captured the soul. And, whether by design or coincidence, the way her sky blue soft armor cupped her chest and accentuated her slender legs only made more imaginations run wild.\nThe moment she appeared, most directly forgot about Wilas and what he had been planning to do. To them, there was no better entertainment than a beauty, even if she only stood there and did nothing else.\nIn a corner to his own, having reunited with the members of his Black City, Jerach was enthralled. He only barely managed to stop himself from whistling.\nIt was fine if he teased a weak woman, but if he teased someone like Jilniya… Well, let's just say he didn't have any fantasies of being castrated any time soon.\n\"What are you doing --?\"\nJilniya all but ignored Wilas. But, it was difficult to get angry at a beauty, so Wilas only shook his head and let her do as she pleased.\n\"That sword.\" Jilniya said coldly, looking from the tip of the blade that reverberated against the ground to the shadowy figure. \"I received reports from my subordinate cities that several massacres had occurred. The perpetrator was a woman with a hunched back, dressed in black robes, and wielding a great sword. That was you?\"\nA shocked silence overcame everyone.\nThe first thing that caught them by surprise was the word 'woman'. It was hard to connect the hulking figure before them with the fairer sex.\nBut, after that sunk in, they recognized the word massacre.\nYou mean to tell them that someone actually slaughtered their way through World's End Falls territory? And even dared to come to Brave City right afterward?\nThey couldn't decide whether this person was brave or just stupid.\nAt this point, it didn't even matter whether Jilniya's words were true or not. When it came to matters like this, whoever held the most strength would be the one in the right. And, it seemed now that not only had this Sword Monstress angered Wilas with her disregard, but she had also enranged Jilniya by slighting the Power behind her.\nNo matter how others looked at it, this would end incredibly badly for this cloaked figure.\nStill, despite the young Heiress' pointed questions, the Sword Monstress still didn't respond. The reverberations of her sword sung through the tower's first floor as though acting as her reply.\n'If you're dissatisfied, just come', it seemed to say.\n…\nAt that very moment, Leonel stood before the Dark Abode, shaking his head.\nHe turned his head toward the looming numbers in the distance and sighed again.\n0:0:8:39\nConsidering his location, it wouldn't take him long to get to the Central Tower. But, he still felt uncomfortable cutting it so close. He wasn't sure if there would be a penalty for being late. But, considering his current situation, he didn't dare to test it out. He felt that if there was a timer, there was a reason for it being there.\nNow, whether that was true or not… once again, he was unsure. But, better safe than sorry.\nHe was a bit regretful that he had allowed the Little Mink to enter on his own now. Unfortunately, Leonel had forgotten that the first time he watched the Little Mink evolve, the little guy had fallen into a deep sleep for several days. This was likely happening again.\n'Forget it. It will take me 2 minutes and 21 seconds to make it from here to the Tower at full speed. I'll wait until 0:0:2:30 is left on the clock, then.'\nLeonel felt that the little mink should be fine within the Abode. From what he knew, there was no one else capable of claiming a Dark Abode. And, even if there were, they would all be taking part in the third phase. So, everything should be fine.\nJust when Leonel had made this decision, a black blur suddenly shot out from the house and barreled right into his chest. The streak was so quick that due to Leonel's absentmindedness, he didn't even notice what happened until it was too late.\n\"…Oof.\"\nLeonel coughed, feeling his ribs rebound against his heart and lungs.\nAfter a while, he laughed, looking at the bundle of fur in his arms.\n\"Were you trying to kill me or something?\" Leonel chuckled.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nLeonel's lip twitched. \"Why does that sound like a yes…?\"\nThe little mink ignored Leonel's words and crawled to his favorite spot around his neck.\n\"Fine, fine. You win.. Alright, let's go.\"",

      "content": "Jilniya's eyes narrowed. \"You overestimate yourself.\"\nWhat happened next was so sudden that no one could have expected it. It was hard to imagine that beauty who elicited the feeling of care and protection in them all would suddenly surge forward and attack without warning.\nIn one instant, Jilniya was like a delicate flower in a vase. In the next, she was a pouncing panther, her slender legs exploding with undeniable power and strength.\nThe Sword Monstress responded as quickly as it seemed humanly possible, raising her sword like a shield across her body.\nJilniya's palm shot forward like a venomous serpent, slamming against the spine of the great sword.\nBANG!\nThe Sword Monstress' body convulsed. It was just a single palm, but it felt as though she had been hit three times continuously.\nA surge of concentric wind ricocheted off the side of her sword, sending her sliding across the ground.\nJilniya didn't seem intent on stopping, her beautiful eyes remaining indifferent as she shot forward again.\nHer movements gave one the illusion of rushing water. It had an undeniable forcefulness, but also hid a fluidity and flexibility that accentuated the curves of a woman.\nBANG!\nA second palm descended. This one was several times stronger than the previous. Rather than carrying three layered strikes, this one carried four.\nThis time, the Sword Monstress lost her footing. Unable to slide along the ground anymore, she stumbled backward and got tossed off her feet.\nJilniya's attack was relentless.\nAny veteran of battle knew that whoever gained an initiative would hold an upper hand. If one managed to keep this advantage, victory would only be a matter of time.\nHowever, it soon became very clear that Jilniya didn't need the initiative to claim victory. Whether it was speed, strength, or ability, she surpassed this cloaked figure by not just a single level.\nThis left those watching baffled. They had thought that this cloaked figure would have a high level of skill after daring to offend two Heirs. Yet, it seemed that when comparing whether this woman was brave or foolish, it was most likely the latter.\nWilas felt his anger dissipate. What a waste of emotions. He couldn't believe he wasted time getting angry at a person so far beneath him.\n'It seems that Jilniya gained an inkling of comprehension toward her Falls Style… Couple that with her ability and she truly would be too troublesome to deal with.'\nEvery time Jilniya attacked, it was as though three, four, five and sometimes even six of her were assaulting the same person all at the same time.\nHer heart couldn't help but be filled with disdain.\n'Just die.' She thought coldly.\nShe didn't know who this person was, but she had truly never met anyone more foolish.\nThanks to the times, this Sword Monstress had already been lucky enough to escape the clutches of her Power. Yet, instead of accepting this bout of good fortune, she actually dove right back into the lion's den.\nJilniya's palm shot toward the Sword Monstress' head.\nThe air around her palm trembled. If one looked closely, it seemed as though her strike was being superimposed. A portion reflected where her palm would be, a portion reflected where it was now, and the last reflected where it had been.\nThese attacks came together as one, causing the air to quake.\nHad this strike been sent out in a Third Dimensional world, there was no doubt that the clap of the sound barrier shattering would have sounded.\nIt was at that moment when Jilniya's palm was just moments away from collapsing the Sword Monstress' head in on itself that things suddenly changed.\nThe Sword Monstress' aura surged. A sinister, dark and bloodthirsty air erupted.\nFrom beneath the hooded cloak, one could see two eyes blazing with a blinding gold light that flickered with a deep darkness.\nThe Sword Monstress swung her great sword to meet Jilniya's palm.\nBANG!\nThe Sword Monstress took several steps back before stabilizing herself while Jilniya took just one. But, without hesitation, the Sword Monstress shot forward again, her great sword trailing to her back like the tail of a comet.\nShe brought her sword forward in a great arc, leaving a blur in the air.\nBANG!\nJilniya forced the Sword Monstress back again, her expression filled with rage. It was as though she couldn't believe that this beast of a woman would dare fight back against her.\nThe spectators remained silent as though scared to get involved in such a thing. They too hadn't expected the Sword Monstress to suddenly fight back, but the truth was that it didn't seem to matter.\nHowever, those who were clever among them seemed to realize that maybe the Sword Monstress wasn't as foolish as she seemed.\nBy now, there was already less than five minutes before the timer struck zero. By feigning an inability to fight back at all in the beginning, she managed to drag out the battle. It was only after it seemed she really might die that she really started to fight.\nIf things went on like this, there was no way Jilniya would be able to kill her before the timer rang out. And, when the third phase began, all the rules would change.\nMost intelligent people seemed to realize this. But, it was difficult to calmly analyze things in the heat of battle, especially when you were enraged like Jilniya. As for why Wilas and Reynred hadn't explained this to Jilniya, there were two reasons.\nFor one, if someone had to explain this to her, Jilniya would only lose more face. And, secondly, after seeing the Sword Monstress' combat power… they no longer feared her. They didn't care whether she died or not, it would hardly change anything.\nThis was the same reason they had for not pressing forward to kill Leonel. His impact on the coming trials would be limited.\nBANG!\nThe Sword Monstress slid back once again. But, this time, Jilniya didn't pursue.\n\"So that's your plot?\" The beautiful Heiress looked toward the ticking time, visible anger twisting her delicate features. \"Unfortunately for you, you've still underestimated me.\"\nAt that moment, many touched their ears, not believing what they were hearing.\nWhere was this sound of rushing water coming from?",

      "content": "Jilniya brandished her palms in a composed stance, her gaze cold.\nJust like there were weapons Forces, there were likewise Forces for various bodily martial arts. Fist Force, Palm Force, various kicking and leg Forces, they all existed. However, just like weapon Forces, these bodily martial art Forces didn't have anything particularly special to them other than a slight boost in strength.\nWhen Leonel comprehended his Spear Force, it was a product of the spear consciousnesses he observed within Spear Domain. He was able to constantly build on this Spear Force, refining it and perfecting it.\nDespite the fact Leonel's Spear Force was still just an empty shell right now, it was still far more powerful than it had been in the past.\nIn the same way, bodily Forces had to be refined over time. Only in this way could they manifest true strength.\nThe so-called 'Falls Style' was a martial arts discipline of the World's End Falls Power. It emphasized a steady, unrelenting flow. Every attack flowed into the next. Upon gaining an initiative with this style, it was impossible to lose it. Had it not been for Jilniya choosing to take a step back now, the Sword Monstress would still be on her back foot.\nIf Leonel had been here, he would realize that this so-called 'Style' was exactly the discipline he had been learning through the stone monuments.\nFor the Falls Style, only upon reaching a high level of comprehension would one hear the sound of rushing waters. It was clear that not only had Jilniya begun to grasp her Power's core teachings, but she was well on her way to mastering them.\nJilniya knew well just how suited this Style was to her. Her ability was shockingly an exceptionally rare time affinity ability that allowed her to layer her attacks. It made a single attack feel like many, giving her great offensive prowess.\nUnfortunately, among time affinity abilities, hers was ranked so near the bottom that she couldn't even dream of claiming the Time Abode. The first time she came to Brave City, she foolishly overestimated herself and almost lost her life in the attempt. In fact, she was still suffering from the loss of over ten years from her lifespan.\nHowever, this didn't mean that her ability was weak. In fact, when coupled with the Fall Style, she was likely the strongest amongst herself, Reynred and Wilas.\nKnowing this, when she saw the enemy of her Power before her, a fiery anger bubbled up within her heart. She was the strongest. How could she possibly allow such a plan to succeed?\n\"Die.\"\nJilniya shot forward again. But, this time, her speed seemed to have almost doubled, her palms raining down like the judgment of a god from above.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nThe Sword Monstress was hardly able to block, but her success only pissed Jilniya off more.\nJilniya's gaze flashed with a hint of red. By now, the sound of rushing water reached a peak. It was as though they were all standing at the base of an impossibly vast waterfall, falling with such strength that it shattered the rocks at its base into powder.\nJilniya's next strike was so fast that it bypassed the defense of the Sword Monstress' great sword and shot right toward her head.\nThe glow of two eyes flickered beneath the hood.\nWith an inhuman reaction speed, the Sword Monstress curled her head away. However, the air pressure grazed her shoulder, causing her body to twirl backward.\nBANG!\nThe Sword Monstress shot tens of meters backward, crashing into the walls of the tower.\nAll those standing in the area shot away, unwilling to get in Jilniya's way.\nThe sound of dripping blood sounded once the tower fell into another silence.\nAt that moment, everyone saw the same thing. The side of the Sword Monstress' cloak was torn away, revealing a now bloodied shoulder. However, what was the most shocking was that this Sword Monstress' so-called hunched back was actually a massive, oddly curved package larger than even the Sword Monstress herself.\nWith much of the cloak ripped away, it was easier to estimate the Sword Monstress' true size. In fact, she looked like quite a petite young lady. And with the way her black hair fell over her face, she even seemed somewhat enticing.\nHowever, those thoughts of curiosity all vanished when the Sword Monstress raised her head.\nIn all their years, they had never seen such a grotesque sight. A ghastly infection ran across her face like the trenches of a muddy war. The scars were so inflamed that they even somewhat covered the portions of her face that hadn't been run across by them.\nColors of green, purple and even gross brown ran across them all. It all reflected beneath the light in a way that made the skin of all those who saw it crawl.\n\"… It's you!\" Jilniya's gaze blazed.\nThe Sword Monstress used her sword as a crutch and pushed herself up. Under the gazes of everyone present, the wound to her shoulder rapidly healed. In the blink of an eye, other than the blood that still ran over her skin, it seemed as though she had never been injured at all.\nJilniya's pupils constricted. She remembered this ability, but it was even more potent than it had been in the past.\nUnfortunately, it wouldn't matter. A dead person couldn't heal.\nThe Sword Monstress walked forward with an indifferent expression. The cloak she wore had nothing to do with a will to hide her face. If it was about this, she would wear a mask instead. Rather, the cloak was a convenient way to hide the curved box on her back. This was what she wanted to hide.\nBut, since it was out in the open already, it didn't matter much anymore. Since she had already made it to Brave City and the third phase was about to begin, keeping it hidden no longer mattered.\nJilniya's gaze flashed with a cold light.\nAt that moment, though, a person suddenly rushed into the Tower's first floor. In such a silent environment, especially when everyone had already arrived early, such an arrival caught the attention of many. Even Jilniya couldn't help but spare a glance.\nA young man with handsome and sharp features shot inside, a wide grin on his face when he noticed the time hadn't quite hit zero just yet.\nThe young man seemed to be in a great mood. But, with his sharp senses, he seemed to realize that something was off about the atmosphere. After scanning the area, his gaze landed on two young women.\nThe young man's eyes widened.\n\"Aina --!\"\nThe young man's expression suddenly changed. Any words he was going to say were cut off, his mind going blank.\nThose who spoke about the details of this day in the future would remember it as the day they felt the most fear they ever had in their lifetimes.\nEach and every person present felt as though their hearts had been gripped by a reaper, like bone cold waters had been poured into their veins, travelling through their bodies and leaving them completely paralyzed.\nOut of her own control, Jilniya's body shot backward at the fastest speed she could muster, her heart thumping so hard that it felt like it might fly from her chest at any moment.\nThe young man vanished, appearing before the Sword Monstress in the blink of an eye. Only a rare few could even see how he moved, and even those who could felt as though he had become nothing but a streak of gold light.\nHe stood before the Sword Monstress, his eyes blazing.\nIn that instant, several collapsed to the ground, their visions turning black. The pressure was so suffocating that even many who managed to maintain their consciousness fell to their knees, tears of fear falling from their eyes.\n\"Who did this to you? I'll kill them all!\"\nA palpable aura surged out like a sea of blood, enveloping the tower's first floor. The young man's voice boomed, causing the air to quake and tremble beneath his rage.\nFor the first time, there was a ripple in the Sword Monstress' gaze.",

      "content": "Leonel had never felt so much anger before. He didn't even think about how it was he recognized Aina at all.\nLeonel had known for a long time that the face he had come to know wasn't Aina's own. He never once thought of asking her why that was. To him, it simply didn't matter. But, after finding out the truth, his blood boiled and seethed.\nHe didn't care about what Aina looked like. Even back when he chose her over so many others and hadn't known about her face coverings, she had never been the most beautiful. He simply went with his gut feeling and accepted it.\nBut now, knowing that someone had done something like this to her, Leonel's visceral reaction was even more violent than it had been when he found out someone had cut something out of him as a mere child.\nAs for Aina, the last thing she had expected was to meet Leonel here. Despite the effort Leonel had put into spreading his name, she had practically cut off contact with the outside world while she was on the run. Where would she have had the time to converse and learn about the hottest rumors?\nHowever, it was precisely because she was so caught off-guard that her gaze rippled so violently. Something about Leonel's reaction shook her to her core.\nAfter she came to this world, she had hoped to forget everything else. In fact, part of the reason she chose to take off her face covering was as a way of leaving those things of the past in the past.\nThis scarred face of hers looked nothing like the face Leonel knew. Even if these scars suddenly vanished, she would look like a completely different person. She had thought that even if she ran into Leonel, there was no way he would recognize her. But, she could have never expected that not only would he, but that he would do so, so quickly. It was almost surreal.\nAs if that wasn't enough to shake her, of all the reactions she expected to find in his gaze, she saw none of them.\nThere was no disgust, there was no hesitancy, there wasn't even a shred of pity. There was nothing but rage.\nLeonel saw red. He was so focused on Aina's face that he hadn't even realized she had been in battle.\nWhen he looked down at her shoulder and saw the yet-to-dry blood dripping down from her already healed wound, his gaze became steely.\nLeonel's head turned to Jilniya, his irises flickering with wild violet-red lights.\n\"You did this?\"\nClearly, this time, Leonel was no longer referring to Aina's scars.\n\"Who gave you the guts?\"\nJilniya trembled. She didn't know why she was feeling such fear. Wasn't this the same Third Dimensional brat they hadn't taken seriously? Where was all this pressure coming from? It felt as though a hand was constricting her throat, limiting her breathing.\nLeonel's palm flipped over, a dense black bow appearing.\nSharp winds kicked up. A fluid conception of a wild blizzard shook the air, wrapping around Leonel and Aina.\nWhether by design of because Aina was simply the only one who never seemed to feel any pressure from Leonel, she stood by silently, her gaze still flickering with a dense swath of emotions.\n\"Die.\"\nLeonel spoke the same word Jilniya had. But somehow, it felt like the true call of the reaper. Compared to the latter's version, it seemed like a command, an unquestionable call from the depths of hell.\nAn arrow whirled to life, forming from the energies of the world.\nA little mink bared its fangs from around Leonel's neck, it's little body growing a size as its fur stood on end.\nA thick black shadow drifted from its body and surrounded Leonel's body. And, at that moment…\nSHING! SHING! SHING!\nLeonel's Force suddenly gained a sharp characteristic. It felt as though he could tear through anything, as though no obstacle could block his path.\nJilniya felt in those moments that no matter how she dodged, nothing would come of it.\nLeonel's sharp gaze locked onto her, a cold murderous intent manifesting around his body. His hair whipped about wildly, his back standing tall and straight as it flexed with all its might. Even through the thickness of his black robes, one could feel the fullness of his figure.\nSHUUUUUUUUU!\nLeonel's fingers left his bowstring.\nFor an instant, it felt as though everyone was thrust into a land of ice and snow, watching as a relentless hail descended from above.\nJilniya felt too much fear to even move. She was locked down by a 'Style' far beyond her Falls martial arts. It was like her every instinct had been accounted for, like even if she dodged it would only be like jumping into the arms of death.\nIt was a feeling she would never forget in her life. She knew she had more strength than this, more power than maybe this attack even had to offer. But, for some reason, she didn't dare to use it. It was as though a higher power had commanded her to accept her death. And… before this power… she was nothing.\nBut…\n0:0:0:0\nDING!\nAn energy swirled around the Tower's first floor, snuffing everything out. Even Leonel's arrow vanished into thin air.\nThe moment the clock hit zero, a central platform elevated from the center of the first floor and a teleportation array flickered. Soon, three forms began to appear.\nWhen they manifested, the first thing everyone noticed was their odd yet valiant dressing. However, Leonel's gaze still carried a bloodthirsty air to it. All he knew was that the appearance of these three stopped his commandment from coming to fruition.\nThe three figures had been casual. This world was definitely not as interesting as being assigned to the others, but they still had to do their jobs. Since they had been thrust into this boring situation together, they had a sense of comradery amongst one another.\nThe truth was that they weren't the ones who snuffed out Leonel's attack, that was just a normal function of the tower. They had no idea that they had been wrongly accused by a kid they wouldn't normally give a second glance toward.\nBut, when they appeared, they felt a savage, relentless aura lock onto them.. Even with their strength, they couldn't help but frown and look toward the source of it.",

      "content": "For a moment it seemed that Leonel really had every intention of attacking these people.\nThose who knew him had expressions that widened in shock. It was one thing to attack Jilniya, but the overseers of these trials were not only outstanding talents from across the universe, but they were most definitely Fifth Dimensional entities at worst. In fact, that was just their speculation from their place at the bottom of a well. For all they knew, these individuals were beyond the Fifth Dimension.\nHowever, judging by Leonel's posture and the fact his aura of rage hadn't dissipated in the slightest, it seemed he really did have every intention of attacking.\nIt was at the moment he almost acted that Leonel suddenly felt something soft grasp his hand.\nHe was so unused to the feeling that he was shocked out of his enraged state.\nThe atmosphere seemed to become several times lighter in the blink of an eye, causing those who had forgotten to breathe to finally heave a sigh of relief. Those who had collapsed to the ground finally relaxed, their minds being released from their shackles.\nIt was only after this happened that Jilniya suddenly understood the state she had been in. In the blink of an eye, her fear became shock, then shame, then rage. However, there was already nothing she could do.\nLeonel shook his head and looked down to find that Aina had grabbed onto his hand.\nWell, it couldn't really be described like this. More accurately, she had grasped onto three of his fingers as though she was scared to grab onto anything more. The sight made Leonel involuntarily chuckle.\nAina frowned. \"What are you laughing at? Are you trying to die?\"\nThis was the first time anyone had ever heard the Sword Monstress speak. They couldn't have ever expected for her voice to be so soft and pleasing to the ears. It was as though she was caressing their eardrums.\nLeonel looked into Aina's eyes curiously.\nAina suddenly became self conscious and looked away. After she had done it, she realized that she was acting out of character.\n'It's ugly, I know.'\nAina didn't say these words aloud. But, this was the very first time she had even thought them to herself. It was a surprise to her that her mind even went to such a place.\nThese scars had been with her all her life. But, they never filled her with disgust toward herself, they only filled her with rage.\nAfter the Metamorphosis began and she realized how she could use them to her advantage, they even became a source of pride for her. It represented her resilience and her hard work.\nFor all these reasons, she couldn't believe what she had just breathed to life in her thoughts. She had never been such a person.\n\"It was the Brazinger family, right?\"\nLeonel's smile vanished once again, his expression hardening.\nAina froze for a moment, but didn't look back toward Leonel.\n\"Good.\" Leonel looked away. \"I'll make certain to raze them to the ground, then.\"\nAina remained silent and slowly let go of Leonel's fingers.\nFrom the distance, Anared watched this with a frown. After regaining his bearings from Leonel's previous outburst, he began to calmly analyze the situation. And, quite frankly, he didn't like what he was seeing.\nHowever, Leonel wasn't paying attention to this anymore. He continued to stand by Aina's side, he wasn't going to let her out of his sight again. Everything else that happened from this point on no longer mattered much to him.\nThe first reason he had agreed to join the Keafir family's quota was in order to find a path toward finding Aina. Beyond that, the only reason he had tried to stand out so much was also for this reason.\nNow, as far as Leonel was concerned, nothing else was quite so important. Of course, he would still do his part to repay the Keafir family for their role in helping him find Aina. That was the least he could do, anyway.\nThe three figures on the platform looked toward Leonel with a frown, wondering where such pressure came from. How could they bothered to care about drama between kids? As a result, they had no idea what had happened here previously.\nBut, looking at the sorry state most were in, they felt it had something to do with this young man.\nTheir gazes unconsciously shifted toward the young woman by his side.\nBy now, Aina had regained her bearing and stood there silently. Though she had let go of Leonel's hand, she at least didn't move away from him. In Leonel's book, that much was a plus.\nThe three figures were much more experienced than the others here. While these kids only saw ugly, infected scars, they saw…\n'A curse?'\nThey raised their eyebrows.\nThe only female among the three looked toward Aina with a gratified gaze. She had no idea who Aina was before this moment, but just the simple act of Aina standing before them all completely maskless left her feeling somewhat in awe and a bit protective of this young girl.\nAny anger she felt toward Leonel unleashing killing intent toward them was already forgotten.\nAs they were observing Leonel and Aina, Leonel, too, was observing them.\n'Their uniforms are also cool…' Leonel couldn't help but think. He really hoped this wasn't a pattern. If he had to gain enmity with another organization with cool uniforms, it would be too depressing.\nAt first, it looked as though all three of them, whether male or female, were all wearing skirts. But, upon closer inspection, Leonel realized that this wasn't the case.\nThe first thing Leonel thought when he realized the truth was…\n'Aladdin's pants!'\nLeonel smiled, remembering the cartoons his father had introduced him to as a child.\nThe uniforms of these three all involved the same harem pants Aladdin wore. The mid sections of these pants swept so close to the floor that some could mistake them for skirts without looking closely.\nAll of their harem pants were a pristine white. In addition, they each had cloth waist belts of a deep black. This cloth wrapped around their waists and then dropped vertically to the ground between their legs.\nThe exposed face of this cloth was inscribed with white embroidery that depicted similar war scenes to the ones that could be found on the wall of Brave City.\nThe men were bare chested revealing their toned and chiseled torsos while the woman wrapped a white cloth around her bountiful chest. However, regardless of gender, they all had vibrant neckwear reminiscent of what a pharaoh of ancient times would wear. This large neckwear was a solid block of silver that hung heavily around their shoulders and collarbone.\nEach and every one of them exuded a powerful aura. Without Leonel's influence, they easily became the center of attention.. No… they demanded it.",

      "content": "Seeing that Leonel didn't seem to be off put by their gazes and even seemed to be sizing them up, the three looked toward one another. Maybe this world wouldn't be as boring as they originally thought.\n\"Alright.\" The female took the lead, stepping forward. Her voice alone grabbed all of their attention, causing them to almost forget everything else. \"Most of you have participated before and are aware of the process.\n\"Those who haven't, step forward. The registration process will be the same. Age, affinity, and rank will all be taken down before proceeding to the next step.\"\nThe central platform flashed with a small light. When it faded, an alter had appeared before the female with a small indent within it.\nNo one dared to test the patience of the three figures. So, those who had already participated in the past took several steps back, making way for the newbies. Among these new participants there were, of course, Leonel and Aina. But, there were other easily recognizable figures.\nThere was Young Miss Swan, Syl, Jerach, and even Zilar.\nThese four kept sweeping glances toward Leonel, but it was as though there was nothing else worth his attention after Leonel appeared. In fact, he seemed to be smiling more, leaving a curtain of warmth around him. It was hard to believe that this was the same young man that fear inducing aura had just come from.\nSyl and Qiyra kept looking between Leonel and Aina. As for Zilar, he had a complicated look in his eye. He still couldn't believe that Leonel had been the one to save him. Finally, Jerach didn't dare to look again after the first time. His chest still weighed heavily with guilt.\nThe truth was that Leonel had long since forgotten about Jerach. But, maybe it was exactly this that left the latter feeling so uncomfortable. It wasn't as though the two were the best of friends, but Jerach still felt like he was losing something.\nBut… how could his loyalty to Leonel already be greater than his loyalty to his own family?\nThough this sounded logical, Jerach knew the real reason he felt guilty. It was precisely because his actions were tantamount to going back on his own word. Since he said his life was now Leonel's, that should have been the end of the story. The fact he was still holding back only meant that he never took his word as seriously as he claimed to.\n\"Jerach Black. 31 years old. Medial Grade Four Wind Elemental affinity.\"\nJerach took his palm away from the groove in the alter. The female nodded slightly.\n\"Um…\" Jerach hesitated.\n\"Is something the matter?\" The female asked, slightly impatient.\nJerach smile sheepishly. Usually, this grin of his worked four out of five times on the ladies. But the female continued to glare at him, causing him to retract it just as quickly as he had deployed it.\nCoughing slightly, Jerach cleared his throat.\n\"What does a Grade Four affinity mean?\"\nThe female didn't really want to answer. But, unfortunately, this was part of her job description.\n\"Affinity is a comparison of your skill with a type of Force in comparison to your Dimensional stage. The higher your affinity in comparison to your stage, the higher the score. Inferior Grade Four is the average for someone within the Fourth Dimension. If you had the equivalent of this affinity within the Third Dimension, your affinity would be marked out at Grade Five. A Grade Five affinity is enough to skip the preliminary rounds.\"\nOf course, what the female didn't bother to say was the fact that an Inferior Grade Four evaluation was only average in terms of the standards of their organization's new recruits. On a Fourth Dimension world like Terrain, especially one reaching the end of its potential, Grade Four was considered to be an elite amongst elites, let alone Medial Grade Four.\n\"Oh, I see.\"\nJerach stepped down feeling somewhat dejected.\n\"Qiyra Snow. 29 years old. Inferior Grade Four Variant Water affinity.\"\n\"Syl Keafir. 30 years old. Medial Grade Four Empty Sword Embryo.\"\n\"Zilar Qanif. 35 years old. Quasi Grade Four Empty Spear Embryo.\"\nZilar calmly accepted his evaluation, his gaze still blazing with determination. For the first time, a curious glint lit in the eyes of the female. It was quite baffling, though, that this glint would appear for the worst evaluation yet.\nAt that moment, with the start of the third phase, the audience had already chosen their seats.\nOf course, it was impossible for them to enter the tower. But, they were now allowed to enter the city and reach the central region around the Tower. There, they found a stadium of sorts where the matters occurring inside the were projected out for the viewing pleasure.\nUnfortunately for them, due to the fact these images only appeared at the start of the third phase, these spectators had no idea what happened between Leonel and the others previously.\n\"Sister-in-law, who's that ugly girl beside that mean guy? Is he two-timing big sis?\"\nRie didn't seem very happy with what she was seeing. While others were focused on the registration, she was paying attention to something completely different.\nHeira remained silent, keeping her elegant posture. Many in the crowd couldn't help but gravitate toward her, but the banner of the Keafir family was too strong of? a barrier.\nHearing Rie's words, a middle-aged man sitting beside Zimo frowned.\n\"What is this all about?\"\nThis man was Syl's father, City Lord Keafir. Hearing that his daughter was being two-timed was definitely news to him. Since when had his daughter been dating in the first place and why didn't he know anything about it?\nHeira smiled lightly. \"It's nothing, father-in-law. Rie just has an overactive imagination.\"\nRie pouted after hearing this, but didn't go against Heira. Though City Lord Keafir raised an eyebrow, he didn't say anything more. Rie's little mental lapses were the last thing on his mind. His son needed to perform well this time. They had much more riding on this.\nOf course, there was someone else who needed Anared to perform well, and that was his very own wife. But, her reason for wanting this was very much different from her father-in-law…\n…\n\"Do you want to go first?\" Leonel asked with a smile.\nAina nodded lightly and walked forward, climbing to the platform and placing her delicate palm upon the alter.\nThe female's eyes glowed. Of all those here, she was most curious about Aina's performance since she had a good impression of the young girl.. But, when she read them, her eyes couldn't help but widen, her breath hitching slightly.",

      "content": "\"Aina Brazinger… 18 years old…\"\nThese words alone caused many to freeze.\nAn 18-year-old within the Fourth Dimension was completely unheard of on Terrain. When they thought back to how long Aina had managed to battle with Jilniya, their hearts couldn't help but tremble. Would they have been able to do such a thing at such a young age?\nAs surprised as those within the Tower were, those spectating from the outside were even more so.\nRie sat completely frozen. Even Heira's brows raised, a look of curiosity on her lovely features. However, her reaction didn't seem nearly as exaggerated as that of the others around her.\nThat said, this age was meaningless to the female. Reaching the Fourth Dimension at such an age couldn't be said to be amazing in her opinion. There were many who reached such a stage without even crossing into the double digits with their age.\nOf course, this didn't factor in the fact that the Metamorphosis had only just occurred on Earth. For those as talented as Leonel and Aina, they could have reached the Fourth Dimension just as quickly had they been much younger when the Metamorphosis occurred.\nUnfortunately, only those who knew they were from Earth were aware of this. However, it wasn't until now that they truly pieced together what this really meant.\nEarth had begun its Metamorphosis barely a year ago. That meant that Leonel and Aina had gained such strength so fast…\nOf course, many had practiced on Earth before the Metamorphosis began, and those who did included Aina. But, to practice without undergoing Metamorphosis was like swimming against a vicious tide. If anything, it made their accomplishments even more impressive.\nStill, since the female didn't know all of this, this wasn't what had shocked her in the slightest…\n\"… Quasi Grade Five Dark Elemental affinity...\"\nAnother bomb seemed to go off.\nTo now, the highest evaluation had been Medial Fourth Grade. To suddenly go up two levels was completely beyond anyone's expectation.\nBut, maybe the most shocking part was that it wasn't a three level leap… it was a three level leap.\nInferior. Medial. Superior. Perfection. Quasi.\nHowever, the female still wasn't finished.\n\"… Medial Grade Four Empty Sword Embryo… Quasi Grade Five Ax Embryo…\"\nHeira's pupils constricted. Just one was already enough for her to sit up, but this was reaching territory where even she was beginning to feel impressed. And yet… the female still wasn't finished.\n\"… Medial Grade Five Life Elemental affinity…\"\nJilniya, Wilas and Reynred stood frozen. Of all those here, their connection with Aina was likely the most complicated. The higher Aina's talent was, the harder their hearts clenched.\nIs this why Aina dared to come here? Is it because she knew what would happen? Is this why she wasn't worried about them in the slightest?\nHow rare was this Life Elemental Force? They had never even heard of it before. At the very least, no Abode had ever appeared in Brave City for it…\nWhat they didn't know was that just like the Dream Abode, such Abodes like the Life Abode appeared and disappeared at will.\nThe people of Terrain believed the Dream Abode appeared randomly, when the truth was that it only ever appeared when those with a small amount of affinity appeared.\nThe thing was that considering what Dream Force represented, it would of course appear more often. After all, anyone with an elevated sensory ability would have a small Dream Force affinity whereas someone with a Life Force affinity would be much rarer.\nThat said, the number of individuals who could use Life and Dream Force to a high level were about the same. Meaning, the rarity still leveled out to equal in the end.\nTo make the complex simple, the short of it was that everyone had a consciousness and many had a stronger consciousness after undergoing a Metamorphosis. But… while everyone had Life, not everyone had an elevated amount of it and even less had such high affinity…\nBut, somehow, the female still wasn't finished.\n\"… Perfect Grade Five Blood Elemental affinity…\"\nSilence reigned as Aina removed her palm. Her expression didn't have any fluctuations upon hearing any of this.\nBut, at that moment, there was a sudden burst of clapping. The issue was that it was only from one person.\nLeonel grinned and clapped enthusiastically, causing Aina to blush and glare at him. But, Leonel continued to clap as though he didn't notice.\nThe females gaze locked onto Aina, it never leaving. In fact, the gazes of the two males seemed to have awakened at that moment. From their lazy appearances, they stood up straight, their gazes burning.\nIt wasn't Aina's numbers alone that shocked them so much, it was the numbers in combination with the curse chaining her. If that curse was lifted…\nOn the outside Rie was pouting. \"… He didn't cheer like that for big sis.\"\nHeira smiled bitterly hearing Rie's words. She could tell that Rie didn't intend anyone else to hear these words, but with their strength, how could they miss it? Once again, City Lord Keafir sent a questioning gaze toward Heira who could only try to dodge it.\nCity Lord Keafir really didn't know how to deal with this daughter-in-law of his. Traditionally speaking, he should be in a higher position in comparison. Yet, he felt as though he was on an equal playing level with this daughter-in-law of his. And, worst of all, he could subtly feel that she was lowering herself to allow him such ease of mind.\nIn the end, he could only drop the topic once again.\n…\nWithin the Tower, Leonel grinned as he watched Aina step down. Though she kept avoiding his gaze, he didn't mind.\nOthers, though, found it hard to believe that the Sword Monstress was even capable of being embarrassed.\nLeonel stepped forward, hopping onto the elevated platform. Though the three figures all locked onto him, he didn't particularly care. He was happier with Aina's result than he would ever be with his own.\nThe female didn't like Leonel very much. Who would like someone who aimed killing intent toward them? But, she still went ahead with the examination with her usual apathetic gaze.\nHowever… She would become frozen just the same.\n\"… Morales?\" The female trembled.\nWhen she saw the list of affinities, her mind went blank.\nLeonel Morales. 19 years old. Quasi Grade Six Empty Spear Embryo. Inferior Grade Six Complete Bow Embryo. Perfect Grade Six Light Elemental affinity. Perfect Grade Six Variant Earth affinity. Perfect Grade Six Star Elemental affinity. Quasi Grade Seven Fire Elemental affinity.\nPerfect Grade Nine Dream Elemental affinity.",

      "content": "Leonel removed his palm from the alter and sent a curious glance toward the female. Usually, she would have begun speaking by now. But, even after several moments, she had yet to.\nIf the female knew that Leonel wanted her to hurry up, she might very well lash out in rage. At this very moment, her mind had become its own war zone.\nUnder any other circumstances, finding such a genius was something she should be jumping around and celebrating. The kind of benefits she would receive from such a thing was endless and that was just considering what she could gain from those old fogies. If she also considered what she could gain by simply having a connection with Leonel himself… the possibilities were endless.\nBut that one name ruined everything. It made her tremble almost uncontrollably.\nMorales.\nAnared only had a shallow understanding of this family, but even he knew of their strength. Maybe the only reason he didn't treat Leonel any differently was because he didn't believe Leonel was a part of them. And, beyond that, even if Leonel activated his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, Anared was ignorant enough to likely not even recognize it.\nBut, for the female… It was as they said, the more powerful one became, the greater understanding and respect one had for those who were truly powerful.\nTo have such a name and to also have a Quasi Grade Six Empty Spear Embryo and a Perfect Grade Six Variant Earth affinity… There couldn't possibly be such a coincidence in this world, right?\nThis meant that Leonel was not only a member of that family, but he was one of the only seven in the Nova Generation to awaken both Lineage Factors. This was the only explanation.\nTo put this matter into proper perspective, one had to understand how the Grading system worked on a deeper level.\nThere were two factors that decided one's Grade: one's affinity and its comparison to one's Dimensional level.\nHowever, this matter still wasn't so simple.\nOne's talent could be considered a growth factor. Let's say for instance someone with average talent was noted as having a 1.0 growth factor while one with a greater talent would be considered a 2.0.\nUpon breaking through to the Fourth Dimension, the average talents strength would become 2.0 and the greater talent would become 4.0. Upon breaking through to the Fifth, the former would become 3.0 and the latter would become 6.0.\nThe disparity would only grow with time. And, the harsh reality of it was that the separation was even more exaggerated than this and could be considered to be exponential.\nWhat was the point of all of this? It was to say that one with greater talent would experience more growth even while improving at the same rate. If this logic was applied to the Grading system, it meant that the disparity between Leonel's Dimensional level and his affinity would only grow with time, meaning that as he continued to improve, his Grade would only continue to do so as well!\nFor the female's organization, Inferior Grade Four was considered average for new recruits. However, Superior Grade Four already made you an elite amongst elites. To touch upon Quasi Grade Five within the Fourth Dimension was enough to make you an asset greatly worth fostering while entering Grade Five firmly would make you among the few worthy of vying for a leadership position within the organization!\nThe main issue here was that… Leonel was still within the Third Dimension! Yet, his worst talent was considered to be of the Quasi Grade Six level. And, his one talent that could be considered to be of the Fourth Dimension, his Dream Force.... Was Perfect Grade Nine!\nThis was all to say that… These three were nowhere near equipped to deal with something like this.\nTake a potential Heir of the Morales family as a new recruit? Was that a joke? Did they have a death wish?\nThe longer the female remained silent, the more those around seemed to hang on her every word. None dared to look away for fear that they might miss something important.\n\"Hello?\" Leonel finally asked.\nIt was a shame he hadn't been paying much attention before, or else maybe he would have been able to read the results himself. That said, he might have been overthinking things. It might not be so easy to read in the first place.\nThe female snapped out from her thoughts and almost couldn't refrain from glaring at Leonel and gnashing her teeth.\nWas he having fun putting her in such a situation? You know well what kind of family you come from, yet you came here to cause trouble. What for exactly? To chase women?\nThe female thought back to how Leonel treated Aina as though nothing else mattered in the world. But, she couldn't bring herself to be too enraged. After all, the current Aina wasn't exactly considered a beauty. It would be much easier to believe that Leonel was just chasing skirts if this wasn't the case.\n\"You…\" The female choked on her words before clearing her throat. \"… Aina Brazinger and Leonel Morales will skip the preliminary rounds. The rest of you new ones, prepare yourselves.\"\nA shocked murmur spread over the crowd.\nShe didn't read out Leonel's Grades, but she also said that Leonel could skip the preliminaries. According to what she said before, that meant that Leonel had at least one Grade Five affinity. But, if that was the case, why not read them aloud?\nLeonel raised an eyebrow but didn't say much more. Didn't skipping the preliminaries mean that he could chat idly with Aina for a while? As long as he got to do that, nothing else really mattered.\nLeonel stepped down from the platform to find Aina looking back at him with a hint of curiosity. It seems that she too wondered why it was that the female hadn't read his Grades aloud like she had done with everyone else.\n\"They say curiosity is the first sign of falling in love.\" Leonel said to no one in particular.\nHowever, when Aina registered his words her heart skipped a beat and her face went red. It was just a shame that much of it was marred by her inflamed scars.\nLeonel grinned. \"Let's go to the side and –.\"\nLeonel's words paused.. His gaze shifted to find Syl's elder brother, Anared, standing before him with a cold expression.",

      "content": "\"Is something the matter?\" Leonel asked.\nLeonel couldn't really understand why Anared had come here with such an aggressive stance. He couldn't remember offending Anared before. Yet, the latter was wearing an even colder expression than he usually did.\n\"What do you mean by this exactly?\" Anared replied coldly.\n\"… What the hell are you talking about?\"\nAnared stared at Leonel for a long time.\n\"It seems you want to die.\"\nLeonel's gaze grew cold.\nAt that moment, Aina also reacted. A slight red light flickered within her almost golden irises. It seemed as though she might pull out her sword at any moment.\n\"Big brother, what are you doing?\" Syl's voice suddenly cut into the conversation. But, Anared didn't respond to his sister.\nHe looked from Leonel to Aina and back.\n\"You'll leave her if you know what's good for you.\" Anared said coldly.\nLeonel suddenly took a step forward. There was nothing that could get him riled up quicker than matters related to Aina.\nIn a single bound, he already stood less than a foot from Anared. With his height, he stared down from above, his gaze reflecting a slight violet hue.\nAnared's sword began to vibrate wildly to his back as though sensing a threat. But, Anared didn't take a step back, his white robes billowing beneath Leonel's aura.\n\"I don't know what story you've woven for yourself,\" Leonel began with an icy tone, \"But, I'd suggest you watch your words. The only reason I chose to join your Keafir family's quota was to find her. I'm sure you're intelligent enough to understand what that means without me spelling it out for you.\"\nLeonel's meaning was clear. Why would he choose the Keafir family over Aina? He would rather fall out with them at this very moment than give up on Aina.\nHowever, his words only enraged Anared more. Others took what Leonel said at face value, but all he heard was that Leonel toyed with his sister's emotions for the only purpose of finding another woman. And, now that he had found her, he couldn't be bothered to care about his sister anymore.\nSHING! SHING! SHING!\n\"BROTHER!\" Syl all but screamed out.\nAnared frowned and looked toward his younger sister.\n\"You're embarrassing me! Step back!\"\nAnared was taken aback by his sister's words. This was the first time Syl had ever raised her voice toward him. Whether it was out of respect or fear, she never had.\n\"You…\"\n\"You misunderstood.\" Syl continued. \"It was sister-in-law that made it look as though we were involved. Leonel never made any advances on me.\"\nAnared's frown deepened. \"It doesn't matter. He must take responsibility regardless.\"\n\"Brother!\"\n\"I don't care.\" Anared continued coldly. \"Since he can use our Keafir family, he should be able to take responsibility for it.\"\nAnared looked back toward Leonel. He was the only one that seemed to match Leonel's aura without taking a step back. In fact, his battle intent soared as though he couldn't wait to cut Leonel down right where he stood.\nThe red in Aina's eyes slowly faded as she seemed to catch an inkling of what was going on. Her eyes shifted toward Syl for a moment before looking away.\nUnfortunately, no one was in position to stop this face off because the three leaders of this trial were having a heated debate of their own.\n…\n\"What the hell's going on Sael?\" One of the two men questioned.\n\"… That kid's family name is Morales.\"\nThe expressions of the two changed.\nThe alter's abilities were mysterious and abstruse. It had the ability to delve into one's mind and find the truest form of address for a person. So, they had no doubt that whether he was a part of that family or not, Leonel's name truly was Morales.\n\"… You sure it's not a case of a lower plane taking on a name they shouldn't? That happens all the time…\"\nSael shook her head. \"…? His… He has a Quasi Grade Six Empty Spear Embryo and a Perfect Grade Six Variant Earth affinity.\"\nThe two men were left speechless once again.\nAt this point, Sael wanted to shed tears. Only she knew that this wasn't the end of it. The more she thought back to Leonel's list of talents, it made her want to ram her head into a wall. Was this the pain of comparing yourself to another?\n'Complete Bow Embryo at 18 years old… What kind of nonsense is that…'\n\"Then what should we do?\"\nThe three fell into silence before one of the men stood.\n\"This is stupid. Why are we hiding away in a corner talking amongst ourselves. Isn't that man himself over there? Sael, you go talk to him and we'll handle these preliminary rounds. Maybe we're missing something important.\"\nThe three of them hesitated.\nUsually, Heirs like this were quite eccentric. What Heir to a Seventh Dimensional family would come down to the Fourth Dimension to chase an ugly woman? If this wasn't eccentric, then what was?\nWho knew, maybe Leonel wanted to keep a low profile and would lash out at them if he was exposed. Knowing this, Sael couldn't help but glare toward the male who spoke. Since you were so confident, why don't you go?\nThe male coughed. \"The fairer sex has a better chance of dealing with such things. Just look at your…\"\nThe male's gaze shifted toward Sael's ample bosom, taking a gulp. How such a thin fabric held back such a… bountiful harvest was beyond him.\n\"… Yup… definitely… he wouldn't be able to bear doing anything to you…\"\nSael's glare intensified. But, thinking of where they were and the image they were meant to project, she decided against slapping her colleague upside his head.\n…\n\"Leonel Morales…\"\nA voice suddenly interrupted the heated stare down between Leonel and Anared.\nIt hesitated for a moment before continuing.\n\"… And Aina Brazinger. Come with me, please.\"\nLeonel's gaze didn't seem to want to leave Anared. But, there was a strong tug at his robes that pulled him back.\nAina all but dragged Leonel away. It seemed that her strength was still ridiculous… No, it had gotten even more ridiculous.\n\"Alright, kids! Line up! Papa Ely is going to eliminate 90% of you!\" One of the two remaining men stepped up somewhat too enthusiastically.",

      "content": "Leonel gave Anared one more look before turning away and following Aina.\nHe realized that he was even more sensitive about Aina compared to how he usually was. Of course, he somewhat understood why this was and inwardly kicked himself. The more he acted like this, the more subconscious Aina would be. He wasn't doing her any favors by being like this.\nIf others heard Leonel's thoughts, they would realize that he seemed to be far more introspective about himself in relation to Aina than he was about himself alone. It was quite an interesting phenomenon, but Leonel, of course, wouldn't notice this.\nSael led the two away. Somehow, likely through a teleportation pad, they disappeared and reappeared in a hidden room that oversaw the first floor. However, Leonel was certain that no one could see them as though they were standing behind a one-way viewing pan of glass.\nOnce they reached this point, Leonel subtly put up his guard. This had long since become a habit of his. In truth, if he could have refused Sael's invite, he probably would have.\nUnfortunately, the environment only became more constrained over time because Sael didn't speak immediately. In fact, she seemed to be hesitating.\nAfter a while, she somewhat awkwardly puffed out her chest as though gathering her courage.\n\"… Be honest with me, why have you come here?\"\nSael looked right at Leonel, ignoring Aina. In truth, the only reason she had called Aina here was because she hoped that whatever feelings Leonel had for Aina would cause him to go easier on her.\n\"Uh …\"\nLeonel stood in confusion before he suddenly 'understood'.\n\"… I know I'm from Earth but I didn't hear anything about being unallowed to participate because of this. Was I not allowed?\"\nSael froze.\nFrom Earth? What was that supposed to mean?\n'Wait, I think I've heard of Earth before… it's a new world the higher ups are really invested in, but what does that have to do with this Heir? What kind of game is he playing here?'\nAina stood the side, quite invested in Sael's answer as well. After all, she was from Earth too.\nThe truth was that the reason she had a ticket to Terrain in the first place was because she heard about Brave City.\nIt had to be remembered that the only reason Leonel would ever come to Terrain was because of Aina. And, the only reason Aina was sent to Terrain by Leonel in the first place was because she had the ticket to begin with.\nIf she couldn't join the organization behind Brave City, she would have to change all of her plans.\n\"You… really want to join us?\" Sael was speechless.\nLeonel frowned. He really couldn't understand what Sael was getting at.\nIn truth, he didn't want to join any organization. Every single one he had to this point had left a bad taste in his mouth. Plus, he had just rejected Old Hutch's offer just a few months ago with the excuse that he didn't want to be under someone else's umbrella. If he joined another organization so quickly after this, he would feel a bit bad.\nThat said…\nLeonel looked toward Aina.\n\"You want to join them?\" He asked.\nAina blinked before nodding.\nLeonel smiled. \"Then I do too.\"\nHis reply was simple but it held quite some sharpness to it. It was very obvious that he was only doing so for Aina, yet it also seemed this was enough to firm his resolve to an immovable degree. It sounded like even if Sael tried to reject him now, he would fight her to the death for standing in his way.\nSael was stunned for a moment before her eyes glowed.\n'Could it be about that? Of course, how could I not think of that…'\nSael looked away and began mumbling to herself like a madwoman. She nibbled at her red lips, lost in her own thoughts.\n'If it really is about that then this could either be a great opportunity or a catastrophe… I can't make this decision on my own… Forget it, when the time comes, this will have little to nothing to do with me, anyway. I might as well reap some benefits now and worry about the trouble that might come later.'\nSael took a deep breath.\n\"Alright, here you both go.\"\nAina and Leonel started as they caught two glistening pieces of metal out of the air. When they flipped over their palms, they found that these metal pieces were actually two rings.\nLeonel looked down in confusion. \"Spatial ring? What's this?\"\n\"These rings have everything you need to be officially inducted as one of our members. Our uniforms and your identification tokens are all in there.\n\"But, I should tell you that until you've gone to our headquarters with your tokens and have been properly registered, they are blank. So, make sure to keep them safe until the time comes.\"\nLeonel was stunned. He sent his senses into the ring and as expected, he found everything Sael spoke about.\nThere were a pair of harem pants, a cloth that he assumed could work as the belt those three wore, and a heavy piece of neckwear also reminiscent of what those three wore.\nThe only difference was that the belt cloth he received didn't have the embroidery those three had. In addition, his neckwear was a solid black that almost look like unpolished iron.\nBut…\nWasn't there supposed to be a long trial?\nHe half expected that he would have to put his life on the line several times just to get an invite to this organization… all for them to piss him off for some reason or another in a few months to eventually force him to leave them.\nThat seemed to be the story of his life to now. Struggling just to earn some more struggling.\nHe had never been expected to so suddenly be handed what all those geniuses of Terrain were fighting tooth and nail for…\nWhat the hell was going on?",

      "content": "Leonel was quite speechless for a long while.\nAina looked down at the ring in her hand before looking toward Leonel's side profile. Though she could sense how surprised Leonel was as well, she also felt that this had to do more with him than her. It left her feeling quite curious.\nBut, when she suddenly remembered Leonel's words from earlier, she blushed and looked away as though unwilling to acknowledge the fact that she had been curious in the first place.\n\"Oh right, I also forgot to mention the last thing. The ring also asks as a life saving treasure, but it won't be activated quite yet. The first time it will activate is when the recruitment process is over. When that happens, the ring will glow.\n\"Once it begins to glow, you have a day to prepare. Within that day, you can activate the ring at any time and be transported directly to our Core World. That's the place you will register.\n\"After the registration process is over, the ring will be able to function normally. As long as it's charged, or depending on the level to which is has been charged, it can teleport its wearer to either a random location within range or to a set location.\"\nLeonel was still quite absentminded during this explanation, but he understood the gist of it.\nRegardless, for now, the abilities of the ring were useless to him until the registration process ended. Only then would it activate and begin to work normally.\n\"Is there no set date for the registration process to be over?\" Aina asked.\n\"Ah, about this…\" Sael sounded somewhat embarrassed. \"… I will be honest. Normally, a place like Terrain wouldn't even be worthy of gaining one of our recruitment stations. But, we've been forced to widen our net recently due to various circumstances. It's much easier on us if we bring everyone in at once… the cost is much less.\n\"So, until we meet a certain number of new recruits, we won't activate the formation. It will probably take between one to three years before the next mass teleportation.\"\nSael coughed slightly and looked toward Leonel. It was only after seeing that Leonel didn't react much to this that she sighed a breath of relief.\n'It seems that he cares more about this Aina's opinion than anything else. I should tell the higher ups to focus on pleasing her, then…'\n\"Oh!\" Leonel's eyes suddenly brightened. \"Can you help me get rid of this thing? There must be certain privileges in being one of your members, right?\"\nSael was stunned for a moment. When she focused on Leonel's forehead, she finally noticed the monitoring brand hidden slightly behind his Emperor brand.\nWhen she realized what Leonel was talking about, her expression became a bit weird.\nThey dared to mark a member of the Morales family? They overestimated themselves a bit too much, didn't they…? If one of those behemoths became enraged, who would take responsibility for it, exactly?\nSael shook her head. 'He probably got into a bit of trouble. But, it makes sense he couldn't get rid of the brand, he's still a bit too weak to do that.'\nLeonel was right. Even members of the organization behind Brave City couldn't be so casually branded without adequate reason, let alone a member of the Morales family.\nBut, Sael seemed to 'understand' that Leonel was hiding himself away, likely to appear 'humble' before Aina and not try to flaunt his status. So, she simply nodded and her Force surged.\nRegardless, since he was practically one of them now, it shouldn't be a problem. Since they only monitored Leonel to begin with, it shouldn't be a matter of life and death anyway.\nLeonel's pupils constricted when he felt Sael's strength. He was truly shocked for a while.\nIn the blink of an eye, Leonel felt invisible shackles that had been around him shatter. Leonel suddenly felt much lighter and better than he had in a very long time.\nHe took a deep breath. It felt as though all the Force in the surroundings surged toward him as he smiled brightly.\n\"Thank you.\"\nThis had been a looming darkness over Leonel for a long while. He suddenly felt much freer.\nAina watched to the side with a puzzled expression. She wasn't sure what the monitoring brand meant. She also wondered how Leonel managed to get into more trouble than she did.\nAina had quite literally slaughtered her way out of cities and hadn't ended up with such a brand. It could only be said that Leonel was truly unlucky.\nLeonel smiled cheerfully. \"I only have one more request, can you help us leave this place secretly?\"\n…\nNot long later, Leonel and Aina walked side by side out of Brave City. So many were focused on the proceedings that no one would notice until the preliminaries ended that two of the participants had disappeared. But, by then, several days would have passed.\n\"Do you have any plans until the ring activates?\" Leonel asked Aina, his smile never leaving his face.\nAina shook her head lightly. Her main goal had been to join this organization. Now that she had, she planned to just wait patiently. Even if she did so on Terrain, it was unlikely anyone would bother her. After all, the status the two of them now had was quite high.\n\"Return to Earth with me.\"\nAina's steps paused for a moment. Her heart was a bit hesitant. Not only did she not like Earth very much, she also didn't know how she felt about getting so close to Leonel again after she had just resolved herself not to.\nThough she now knew that Leonel could hold his own and that maybe his background wasn't so simple, this had never been the reason she tried to build a wall between them in the first place.\nBut, before she even went through a logical progression, she still found her head involuntarily nodding before she quickly shifted to shaking it.\n\"… I … I just broke into the Fourth Dimension. I can't return to Earth by normal means.\"\nAfter saying this, she sighed a breath of relief. Yes, this was a very good reason.\nHearing this, Leonel was slightly disappointed. He needed to return to Earth to deal with the Royal Blue Fort. He couldn't allow things to just continue like that without stepping in. He was still worried about what might be happening to his teammates…\nLeonel looked down at his ring and slipped it onto his finger, walking aimlessly forward.\nHe couldn't just ignore the lives of his teammates just to follow beside Aina. There was a limit to how much he could place her as his first priority.\nSuddenly, Leonel froze.\nHe looked down at his ring. He remembered, when he looked inside of it, its space was much larger than his spatial bracelet.\nWhen Leonel came to Terrain, he noticed that his bracelet went from having a two cubic meter space to one. But, this spatial ring had a ten cubic meter space.\n'… The Segmented Cube should be able to fit inside of it even if there's a human inside.'\nLeonel's eyes glowed and he explained his idea to Aina.\n\"… How about it?\"\nLeonel looked toward Aina expectantly.\nAina's heart trembled beneath Leonel's gaze. For some reason, she couldn't bring herself to say no. In fact, she felt somewhat warm inside.\nA treasure that could house a person? Just what level of secret was that? But, Leonel didn't even hesitate to divulge it.\nLooking down toward the ground, her head nodded ever so slightly. Even with Leonel's senses, he almost missed it. But, when he confirmed what he had seen, his grin took up half his face.\n\"Okay, let's go. We can pay them back for putting us in this mess to begin with.\"\n**\nLeonel had no idea that while he was feeling the happiest, Shield Cross Stars had noticed the disappearance of his marking brand.",

      "content": "\"What happened? How is that possible?\" Fin abruptly stood, almost knocking his office table over.\nDuring the past several months, he and Thorn had been wracking their brains, trying to figure out a way to pin Leonel into a corner. However, the longer they observed Leonel for, the more troublesome this matter seemed to become.\nBy some magic, the refugee they had singled out suddenly became a vassal of the Keafir family and even entered Brave City. Though their organization wasn't necessarily afraid of the powers behind Brave City, Scithe's hidden meaning during his talk with them already made it clear that they couldn't so boldly use the strength of Shield Cross Stars.\nOn top of this, even if they had the freedom to do as much, entering Brave City during the first phase would enrage all the powers of Terrain and entering during the second phase was all the more impossible.\nWhen they learned that Leonel had done this, they realized that their only chance was to wait for him to leave and then set a trap for him.\nThe truth was that they didn't consider a possibility of Leonel being accepted as a member of this organization at all. After all, in the history of Terrain, no one had ever managed to pass over the final hurdle. And, those who had the best chance were on their second and final attempts like Syl's elder brother and the other Heirs.\nThey thought that even if Leonel was talented, he would at least need a second attempt. But, with their influence, he likely wouldn't even live to see it.\nUnfortunately… just as they had calmed themselves with this narrative… Leonel's monitoring brand vanished.\n\"Someone find out for me as quickly as possible what happened in Brave City!\" Fin barked.\nDue to Scithe's warning, Fin and Thorn didn't dare to get too close to the situation. As a result, they didn't even dare to personally monitor the situation of the third phase. Even sending someone to scout the situation was risky, but at this point, they no longer had a choice.\nThorn met Fin's gaze from across the room, both of them holding a complex look on their visages.\nIn order to get rid of that Brand, someone exceptionally powerful within the Fourth Dimension or someone of the Fifth Dimension, in the very least, would have had to act. There shouldn't be anyone powerful enough on Terrain to accomplish this feat. If there was, they were all old recluses that didn't casually travel out.\nThis meant that the likeliest explanation was that Leonel had gotten help from those behind Brave City. And, if that was the case, that made things much more complicated.\nUnder normal circumstances this wasn't a big deal. There was no need for that organization to communicate with them before freeing one of their own from monitoring. Since they hadn't labeled Leonel with having committed any egregious crimes, they were perfectly in the right.\nSuddenly, their hope of keeping these matters low profile had come back to bite them.\nHours later, Fin and Thorn received the report they were waiting for, only to read it silently with ever increasingly ugly expressions.\nThinking back to their disdainful dismissal of Leonel, especially in the case of Fin who sneered as Leonel was forced to sign his name, their jaws clenched.\nThe two looked at one another. They knew they had no choice but to bring this to Scithe…\n…\nScithe read the report Fin and Thorn brought him silently. But, this very silence felt like a mountain weighing heavily on their chests. The longer Scithe remained like this, the greater this pressure grew.\nA long while later, Scithe placed the documents down.\n\"Have you two noticed anything interesting about this world?\"\nFin and Thorn looked toward one another, confused about the question. Wasn't this supposed to be about Leonel? Why were they suddenly talking about Terrain?\n\"… Please enlighten us, Commander Scithe.\"\nScithe's head tilted slightly as he observed the two before him. It didn't seem like a normal human quirk at all. When his pale skin and sunken eyes were taken into account, he looked like a predator watching his prey.\nHis black eyes darted between their vital points as though always calculating the fastest way to kill them. The feeling was like a coldness seeping into their veins.\n\"If you two really have no idea, I would be greatly disappointed.\"\nFin and Thorn shivered, their teeth chattering. For some reason, it felt as though the temperature in the room had plummeted.\n\"Tell me, why is it that you detained this Leonel Morales in the first place?\"\n\"We… We detained him because of a tip given by a teleportation station attendee. Our organization's motto is to be a Shield across the Stars, but in order to do so we need to work together with the local governments. The officials of Terrain were worried about the sudden activity of a few fugitives, so we began to monitor anyone who looked suspicious.\"\nThorn explained quickly. In fact, her response was so textbook that she forgot to take out things that Scithe obviously knew already. But, it just went to show just how nervous she was feeling.\nScithe looked back toward the documents on his desk casually. But, his subtle action took a world of pressure off of the two of them… Until he spoke his next words, that is.\n\"'Work together with the local government', huh?... For a small fee, though, is that right?\"\nThorn and Fin froze, beads of sweat pouring down their faces and backs. All the words they wanted to speak got lodged in their throats, unable to form into proper sentences.\n\"… Some corruption is inevitable in such a large organization. In fact, I would argue that it's necessary in many cases. But, that doesn't give you license to be stupid. Such a big secret is looming over your heads and you don't even realize that you're being used to keep it as such.\n\"Disappointing. Truly disappointing.\"\nScithe closed the documents once more and stood. By this point, Fin and Thorn were trembling uncontrollably. It felt as though there was only a thin string dangling from the tops of their heads to the ceilings above, stopping them from collapsing to their knees.\n\"There's no point in explaining these things to you. Since you haven't understood it by now, it will only be a waste of my time.\"\nScithe crossed his arms to his back and looked out toward the blank wall. His actions seemed to be out of habit, but the fact there was no view to see made it all seem somewhat odd.\nHowever, with the amount of fear the two officers were feeling, they didn't even pick up on this detail at all.\n\"The recruitment process of Valiant Heart Mountain won't finish for another one to three years. By then, there will be plenty of chances to complete what needs to be done. I'll have you two complete some preparations, I only hope you don't disappoint me again.\"\nHearing these words, the two could no longer stand it and collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath as Scithe strolled out from the hidden underground room.",

      "content": "Leonel was shocked by how easy it was for him to return to Earth. He had been looking over his shoulder the whole way, yet not only did no one stop him, but the experience was surprisingly pleasant.\nCompared to what he experienced when he was branded like a slave, the difference was like night and day. He easily found the closest city by following the roads and avoiding danger using his vastly improved Internal Strength. Then, after paying a hefty fee, he was able to buy a ticket to use a teleportation platform.\nLeonel didn't have Urbe Coins, but, he did have a large amount of Urbe Ore. This was what he relied on to constantly refine his body toward the Perfection Stage. Thankfully, the process of trading in Urbe Ores for Urbe Coins was exceptionally easy, there were a few government trade posts he could find within any city.\nLeonel was a bit surprised to find that Urbe Ore was actually more valuable that Urbe Coins. But, after some thought, this made sense.\nUrbe Coins were usually only used by low level worlds to make things convenient for their weaker citizens. In higher level worlds, and especially in high profile markets, auctions and the like, most trades were completed with unrefined Urbe Ores. In these cases, rather than using individual coins, the denominations were in kilograms of Urbe Ore.\nThankfully, in regards to those of Third and Fourth Dimensional worlds, Leonel was considered semi wealthy. So, buying a single ticket to Earth wasn't a problem and also didn't even make much of a dent into his financial situation. If anything, refining his Metal Body was by far the largest expenditure.\nAt Leonel's current level, even absorbing ten kilograms worth of Urbe Essence hardly budged the needle anymore. It seemed that reaching the Perfection Stage wasn't as easy as he thought it would be.\nLeonel wondered if he should try and trade up to Bronze Grade Urbe Ore to try and make a final breakthrough. But, in the end, he decided against it. His recklessness had already almost killed him once this year, he didn't want to give the fates a chance to take him to the next world again. Not so soon after the last time, anyway.\nOf course, if others heard Leonel's thoughts, they would think he was a madman. If he really thought he had only tempted fate just once, he was crazier than even he knew.\n…\nLeonel disappeared into the teleportation formation with no one realizing that he was a wanted criminal. The process for leaving a world was obviously much less involved than coming to it. Whatever problems he posed would be the issue of that world to deal with.\nUnfortunately, Leonel's good mood didn't last very long. He had forgotten one very important thing in all his excitement…\nEarth didn't have any teleportation pads.\nWhen Leonel appeared, he blankly stared at his surroundings.\nWild winds whipped around him, black clouds rumbled above, thunderous booms and crackling lightning shook the skies. And…\nHe was falling from the skies.\nLeonel hardly reacted. He simply looked toward the black ocean waters he was hurtling toward at inconceivable speeds.\nThis was the look of a defeated man. A man who was so used to his bad luck by now that he could only sigh.\nWhat were the odds that he would appear in the skies above the ocean? If Leonel thought about it, the likelihood was actually quite high. After all, 70% of Earth was nothing but vast waters. But, it probably wasn't the smartest thing to do to tell a man down on his luck that his situation made sense.\nLuckily…\nLeonel reached out toward his spatial ring with a thought. In the blink of an eye, a black object appeared beneath his feet like a floating surfboard.\nLeonel smiled wildly. He had been waiting for an opportunity to use this treasure. Unfortunately, he didn't dare to use it on Terrain for fear that he would be the subject of someone's greed. After all, this treasure was of the SSS-grade and happened to be the ride Leonel had asked Uncle Montez for.\nThe treasure had two modes, but both were only built for a single person to use.\nThe surf mode, which Leonel was currently in, had the greatest degree of freedom for movement. It was nimble and shifty, but it sacrificed topline speed in return.\nThe second mode…\nLeonel poured his Force into the surfboard as his fall slowed to a floating hover.\nSoon, the black board shifted, becoming a one person shuttle. Leonel sat down, reaching out his hands and grabbing onto a butterfly steering wheel. Even if he wanted to, he didn't think he'd be able to stop the grin from spreading across his face.\nThe shuttle mode was where the real speed lay. It took a minimal amount of Force to output tremendous speed. If Leonel used normal Force, he could probably round Earth in six hours at most. If he used Light Elemental Force, that time plummeted to half of that.\nOf course, the shuttle lost nimbleness as a result. But… in return it was blazingly fast.\nLeonel pressed down on the pedal. The instant he did, a strong G-force tried to rip him apart, but his smile didn't fade. With the strength of his body, he could still handle it.\nA black-gold light streaked across Earth's water as the laughter of a teenage boy sounded beneath the rumbling clouds.\n**\nLeonel easily made it to Earth's main continent. Aside from being a transportation vehicle, the shuttle could project a rough map of the world. Though it didn't have anything as detailed as city locations, it had enough about the geography.\nWith Leonel's education, the geography was all he needed to find his way back to Royal Blue Province in just over an hour. In fact, he was a bit disappointed that the trip was so short.\nLeonel found a secluded region away from Invalids. Due to the speed of the shuttle, any that sensed the Force he used to propel his shuttle had long since been left behind, but he was still cautious.\nAfter burying himself deep underground, Leonel entered the Segmented Cube.\n\"Aina?\"\nLeonel didn't find Aina where he thought he would. But, his sharp senses soon caught the sound of moving water.\n'She's in the bathhouse?'\nLeonel's heart skipped a beat.",

      "content": "Leonel willed himself to calm down and he entered his own room, leaving Aina to herself.\nNow that he thought about it, he really had left her alone for quite a while. It made sense that she would find something to do. Who knew when the last time she had a time to relax was?\nLeonel couldn't help but smile.\nBack in the Joan Zone, Aina never needed to bathe due to her military-type uniform. Its self-cleaning function made sure she wouldn't need to worry about it. So, this was the first time Leonel had experienced this sort of feeling.\nWhat started as him forcefully suppressing the lewd thoughts of a young man became him appreciating the sound of the moving water in a silent but sweet peace. It had become less about the fact Aina was washing herself and more about that she trusted him enough to do so.\nMaybe he was just overthinking it. There was always a chance that he was. But, the thought still brought him peace of mind.\n\"Oh… You're back, I hope you don't mind I…\"\nAina's voice woke Leonel from his odd peaceful state.\nHe looked up toward her and smiled. The slight embarrassment on Aina's face made his smile somewhat brighter. He could see that she hadn't really thought about it before choosing to bathe here. Knowing Aina, if she had thought it through, she wouldn't feel embarrassed in the slightest.\nThat realization only made him happier. It was like an unconditional trust even she wasn't aware she had for him.\nLeonel's brows raised as he stood from his bed and walked to the door he had left open.\n\"The swelling, it's gone down. Were the waters helpful to you?\"\nLeonel realized this immediately. Before, the swelling and inflammation of Aina's scars was quite bad. It was to the point that it seemed they might burst with a foul liquid at any moment. In fact, he could hardly see the features of her real face because of this.\nWhat Leonel didn't know was that this always happened after Aina used the effect of the curse to help her training. The impact was even more exaggerated after she ingested the Fifth Dimensional Abyss Panther blood.\nUsually, it would take months for the swelling to eventually die down. But, this time, it didn't seem to want to go away at all and left her in a perpetual state of pain and itchiness. Surprisingly, though, the Cleansing Waters of the Segmented Cube's Abode Setting quelled this swelling almost immediately.\nAina lowered her head, avoiding Leonel's gaze.\n\"… Mm.\"\nLeonel didn't mind this much at all. In fact, he was even happier that he could be of help.\n\"All of the water in the Segmented Cube comes out as Cleansing Waters, take as much as you want to bathe or drink.\"\nAina's eyes widened. \"… I can't do that, it's too valuable.\"\nLeonel raised an eyebrow. \"Is it? This Abode seems to make an endless supply of it.\"\nAina was speechless toward Leonel's ignorance.\nShe looked up with a glare Leonel was familiar with seeing. Usually, she only used this look when she was reprimanding him.\n\"Cleansing Waters are incredibly rare. It can only be produced by a person with a very special Innate Water Force Node. Even for such a person, it's a hard task to form even a single cup of it. Other than that, it can only be produced naturally at the convergence of Seven Purities.\"\nLeonel blinked, not really understanding what much of that meant, especially the Seven Purities part. All he knew was that he used this water for everything from taking a bath to brushing his teeth to drinking a glass of water.\nIn fact, though he didn't check for obvious reasons, he was pretty sure his toilet water was made of it too.\nLeonel waved a hand. \"Never mind that. Seriously, take as much as you want. There's no need to suffer in silence when I'm here.\"\nAina's glare became somewhat vacant for a moment as though she was shocked to hear such words.\nShe stared blankly at Leonel, getting lost in her thoughts for a moment.\nLeonel met her gaze as though trying to convey his meaning and determination through his eyes.\nAfter the swelling lessened, Leonel could see the true structure of Aina's face. He burned the image into his mind, not only because he was infatuated with her looks, but because this was the first time he was truly seeing the real her.\nThis was the woman, in all his madness, that he had sworn to hitch his life to.\nMaybe to this day he still didn't know the exact reason. But, didn't they say that in this new world the future could influence the past? Leonel liked to believe that maybe he was less crazy than many believed and that an undying devotion his future self felt was what drove him now.\nHowever, this only gave Leonel motivation. What shook him to his core was maybe if it wasn't a future love that caused his current feelings, but a future regret…\nWhat if he lost Aina in the future? What if the feelings of hurt, anger, and helplessness were so powerful that they pierced through the veil of reality and returned to his younger self, driving him to not repeat the same mistake again?\nThis was probably the first time Leonel even admitted these things to himself, but something was screaming to him that it wasn't just love that drove him to this level of madness.\nHe had said it himself before, hate drove far more than love did. Negativity fueled more than positivity, evil disseminated far more than good.\nFor Leonel to feel this way, he knew that it wasn't a simple matter of love.\nLeonel reached a hand toward Aina's face. The action shook her from her stupor. Her body involuntarily trembled as though wanting to take a step back. But, for some odd reason, her feet seem rooted in place.\nLeonel smiled a somewhat sad smile. It carried a weight that was far beyond his years and an emotion that was far more complex than he was willing to feel. Seeing it, Aina felt as though she too had been thrust into an all new world, one she also wasn't quite ready for.\nLeonel's hand brushed by Aina's face and touched her flowing black hair.\nA slight rush of Force surrounded the two and Aina, who had become completely lost in Leonel's smile, barely registered the fact the air had grown much hotter all of a sudden.\nIn the blink of an eye, Aina's wet hair became dry and Leonel retracted his hand.\n\"Wouldn't want you to catch a cold, right?\"\nLeonel grinned, his normal childish look returning. Whatever weight his gaze once held vanished, making Aina's knees feel somewhat weak. Out of her control, she fell forward only to be stopped by Leonel's broad chest.\nLeonel was stunned for a moment, but he didn't let her escape like she wanted to.\nHis arms wrapped around her back, enveloping her small frame.\nAina froze for a long while. But in the end, her small hands gripped the sides of Leonel's shirt.\nA peaceful silence took hold of the Segmented Cube.. As the clouds continued to rumble and Earth seemed to become ever more chaotic, the two seemed oblivious.",

      "content": "Leonel almost couldn't refrain from laughing as he watched Aina run away like a frightened rabbit. Even a while after she had disappeared into the room she chose, he could still feel the softness of her frame.\nBehind the closed door, Aina slipped down to the floor, her face a beet shade of red. Her heart beat wildly and completely out of her control. It made her breathing seem somewhat erratic and anxious.\nThe last time she had been so intimate with Leonel… her legs had been blown off. So, it was safe to say that she wasn't really thinking about how embarrassed she should or shouldn't have been.\nBut this time, there wasn't such a looming elephant in the room. It was almost too much for her to bear.\nIt was only a long while later that Aina's heart finally calmed. Ironically, it was because she could hear the same moving waters Leonel had just moments ago. Just listening to them made her feel the same peace Leonel had.\nAina reached a hand toward one of her military pockets and pulled out a cracked bracelet.\nIt was quite funny. Considering all the treasures she had, a mere C-grade defensive treasure was practically useless garbage. But, other than her ax, this had been one of the only things she managed to hold on to in her injured state back then.\nShe looked at the bracelet until the sudden end to the rushing waters woke her up. She quickly put it away, the hazy look in her eyes clearing.\nAt that moment, a knock came from her door. Unsurprisingly, it was Leonel. He was the only other one in the Abode Setting to begin with. But, what Aina hadn't expected was that when she opened the door a black blur would suddenly pounce at her.\nHer first instinct was to reach for her ax, but she instantly realized that she had taken it off her back. She felt safe in this place so she wasn't constantly on her guard.\nIt wasn't long after that she realized that even if her ax had been on her back, she wouldn't have been able to get to it in time. This black blur was simply too fast.\nA strong force collided with Aina's chest, causing her to take a step back. But, when she looked down, she found and adorable little mink using its small claws to latch onto a few of her countless pockets.\nLittle Blackstar, seemingly feeling a familiar intimacy with Aina through his connection with Leonel treated her like a playmate too. Unfortunately, though Aina was stronger physically than Leonel, her body's defenses were far weaker. So, what would be a playful nudge to Leonel almost knocked Aina's breath away.\n\"Little Blackstar.\" Leonel reprimanded.\nThere wasn't much he could do about the little mink. The little guy was simply too fast… It also didn't help that Blackstar treated Leonel like his pet rather than the other way around. This left Leonel feeling somewhat helpless.\nAina took a deep breath to recover before looking down at the little mink. A light smile played her features as she slowly reached a hand forward to pat Blackstar's small little head.\n\"This is your beast partner?\" Aina asked.\n\"Mhm.\" Leonel nodded. \"The little guy is pretty powerful but is too playful. I thought that he was growing more mature because he started to take more naps recently, but now he's back to his usual antics.\"\nAina blinked curiously, gathering the adorable little mink in her arms. Blackstar seemed to quickly realized that compared to around Leonel's neck and the top of his head, Aina's chest was the much more comfortable place to be. It wasn't long before the little guy showed no intention of returning.\n\"How did you manage to contract him?\"\n\"Well…\" Leonel scratched his head somewhat awkwardly. After some hesitation, he finally told the truth.\n\"—Pchu!\"\nAina couldn't refrain from laughing, her light giggle tickling Leonel's ear drums.\n\"Hey, hey. Is there a need to laugh so hard? We share a relationship of equals.\" Leonel said defiantly.\n\"Mhm, mhm.\" Aina nodded but continued to play with the little mink, a happy smile on her face.\nLeonel sighed as he watched this scene. It seemed that not only did he lose his beast partner to Aina's chest, he lost Aina to the little mink. Life truly wasn't fair.\n…\nThe next few moments between the two were quite peaceful.\nWithin the dining area of the Abode Setting, Leonel brought out some of the foods he had bought before leaving Terrain. However, Leonel was shocked to find that Aina didn't only match him in how much she ate, but she even somewhat surpassed him.\nLeonel had spent months within a Zone with Aina, but he hadn't noticed this before at all. After a while of thought, though, he understood. And when he did, he felt somewhat bad.\nIn the Joan Zone, he and Aina had always hunted for their own food. Since he was the long ranged attacker amongst the two of them, it obviously fell onto his shoulders. But, he always only captured one beast.\nHe would always take most of the beast and leave behind what he thought would fulfill Aina's appetite, not realizing that he was underfeeding her at all.\nThis time, however, because he was curious about Terrain's cuisine – after all, this was the first time he was tasting another world's food – he had brought back way too much, thinking he could just store whatever was left within one of the snowglobes to preserve it until next time.\nHowever, what he had never thought of was the possibility that between the two of them, clearing out such a large amount of food was a simple task.\nLearning this about Aina didn't make Leonel like her any less. In fact, he felt happy once again because he was learning more and more about her the longer he spent with her.\nHe didn't apologize for his mistakes in the past, he just etched this into his mind. He wouldn't make the same mistake again.\nAt the same time, he made a mental note to be more observant in the future. For whatever reason, Aina didn't seem to like to divulge such things openly. It would be up to him to decode this beauty.\n\"Hm?\"\nAina looked up with a cute and innocent look in her eye. But, contrasted with the massive beast leg she held in her hand, Leonel couldn't help but smile at the adorable image.\nThough the beast leg was larger than half Aina's body, Leonel was certain that it would probably only take Aina half an hour at most to wipe it clean.\nLeonel shook his head.\n\"We should talk about the Fort and how to approach it.\" Leonel said.\nAina paused mid-bite. The truth was that she too wanted to take down Royal Blue Fort, she also had friends within. But, they had to think of the normal citizens as well. If things devolved the way it did last time, they would be doing more harm than good.\nSo, how should they do things this time?",

      "content": "Royal Blue Fort's situation was more complex than Leonel knew.\nIn truth, there were many things that Leonel hadn't thoroughly thought through until he had a conversation with Aina.\nFor one, what purpose was he truly trying to accomplish?\nActing against Royal Blue Fort, even if it was just to kill a Junior Governor Duke, was no less than an act of war. At this point, Leonel would be truly setting himself as the lifelong enemy of The Empire no matter how one looked at it.\nBeyond this, after killing the Junior Governor Duke, how would things proceed from there? Who would take leadership of the people who would be left behind? Would The Empire treat them all as rebels if they chose to follow Leonel? Did Leonel even want to lead them?\nIt wasn't that Leonel was too unintelligent to think of these things, it was rather that he was still too immature. He cared more about paying the Junior Governor Duke back for harming Aina and slighting himself than he cared about the consequences his revenge would bring.\nThis was the true reason Aina wasn't as enthusiastic about Leonel's plans to begin with. She had even initially rejected Leonel's suggestions. But, for some reason, in the end, she couldn't bear to say no after Leonel brought up the Segmented Cube plan.\nStill, she had no choice but to douse some cold water over Leonel's dreams.\nAfter talking some reason into Leonel, they decided on a plan.\nFirst, they would scout out the situation. With their abilities, it wouldn't be a problem to observe the Fort from afar. Even slipping into the core of the city protected by the Junior Governor Duke's illusion ability wouldn't be an issue.\nIf they found that their friends and their families were struggling, they would use the snowglobes to take them in and escape the city. They would then bring them to another Fort in a new Province.\nThis last part of the plan was a bit more difficult to pull off. After all, The Empire had strict monitoring standards. But, they had the perfect excuse for this as well.\nOne had to remember the Right to Autonomy Ammendment of the Ascension Empire. As long as they had a valid excuse for breaking the law, they would be in the right.\nThere was really no better valid excuse for escaping one's Fort than the fact one's Junior Governor Duke bombed his own citizens…\nOf course, Leonel still planned to kill the Junior Governor Duke one way or another. Even if he died, there were several other nobles there to take charge. It's just that he would be covert about his actions so as not to implicate his friends.\nWith this more level-headed plan, Aina and Leonel made their way to Royal Blue Fort. However, they hadn't expected to find the scene they did after approaching…\n…\nSince the appearance of Camelot in the skies, Earth's climate had taken a massive hit. The poles seemed to flip, the magnetic field was out of whack, and there wasn't a single peaceful inch of Earth left.\nThe common people didn't know what was happening, but the higher ups were shocked by the sudden appearance of a second moon.\nUnfortunately, the only person who knew exactly what was happening – Leonel – had washed his hands of the matter. Luckily, there was still the Slayer Legion and the Adurna family who had an inkling of what was going on.\nThat said, being aware of what was happening wasn't quite enough. Earth no longer had the means to calm this situation.\nHad this happened before the Metamorphosis, The Empire might still have some means of stabilizing the climate. But, with the interference of Force, not only was technology interrupted from functioning properly, but the weather was even more volatile than it would be otherwise.\nRoyal Blue Province was a coastal continent near the equator. As such, it experienced tropical weather all year 'round. But now…\nIt was buried beneath several feet of snow.\nThough it wasn't bone chillingly cold, this made the situation far worse. The snow fell as an almost half water, half snow combination, making the layering of the white precipitation quite heavy. In addition, where it wasn't heavy, it was exceptionally slippery.\nSheets of ice covered everything. Even the tall Fort walls were covered with an ever-thickening layer of ice.\nCaught completely off guard by the sudden changes, the Royal Blue Fort was scrambling.\nThe good news was that after several months of dealing with these conditions, the Fort had finally managed to find methods of combating this situation. The bad news, however, was that this wasn't the end of their problems.\nIt had to be remembered that the appearance of Camelot wasn't just a matter of climate change. The most important point was that Earth's path toward the Fourth Dimension had been accelerated by several times over.\nThe truth was that Earth had already cleared enough Zones. Leonel knew that Earth's progress had to be great because he didn't receive his usual reward for being the first to clear an SS-grade Zone. This meant that someone else had to have succeeded before he had!\nThis should have been a great thing, but it was very much not for two reasons.\nThe first was that The Empire had yet to finish consolidating its strength. And the second was that… the activity of Invalids and beasts likewise skyrocketed.\nWhen Aina and Leonel found a collapsed building to observe the Royal Blue Fort from, they were shocked to find a horde of Invalids surrounding it.\n\"That… Is that possible?\"\nLeonel's eyes widened.\nAmidst the horde, Leonel picked out several SS-grade and SSS-grade Invalids. Each of them had strength he couldn't have hoped to match up against before he entered the Camelot Zone. Facing such a horde, he would have had no choice but to turn tail and run away as fast as he could.\nIn order to fight them off, Royal Blue Fort was using its tall steel walls and an endless barrage of bombs. If not for Earth's technology, the Fort would have long since been overrun.\nBut, this wasn't what shocked Leonel the most.\n\"… That's a Variant Invalid…\" Aina said softly.\nIn the distance, Leonel locked onto an Invalid dressed in all white. Its skin was as white as snow, its hair as white as bone, its robes as white as clouds. The only thing on its body that wasn't a blinding white were its piercing blue irises.\nLeonel was shocked. From what he knew, all Invalids had white irises. But this one…\nA flood of memories were pulled from the depths of Leonel's mind.\nVariant Invalids. They were Invalids who managed to recover their intelligence. However, due to the fact their awakening was so much more difficult, they were far more powerful than their human counterparts.\nAnd, maybe the most shocking part of their abilities was that… they could lead other Invalids.\nLeonel was so lost in his own thoughts that he didn't notice Aina's jaw clench tightly, her small hands trembling slightly.\nHer reaction to this Variant Invalid seemed much too strong. Maybe only those who knew the legends of the Mountain Sands Range she had escaped from might know why…",

      "content": "Leonel frowned, his gaze landing on Aina.\nSeeing her odd reaction, his heart constricted. One would have thought that her reaction was his own. To Leonel, though, Aina's happiness was practically linked to himself.\n\"Aina?\"\nAina shook out of her thoughts hearing Leonel's voice.\n\"What's wrong?\"\nAina shook her head and fell into silence, her body returning to normal. The little mink nestled closer to her, his little face rubbing against Aina's.\nIn truth, Leonel almost didn't notice Aina's weird reactions. If it wasn't for his connection with the little mink, he likely would have missed it entirely. The irony of it all wasn't lost to him, especially when he said he would pay more attention to her.\nLeonel's frowned deepened. His gaze shifted from Aina to the Variant Invalid and back again.\n'Is it that thing? But, Aina shouldn't have met this thing before…'\nIt could be said that with the exception of the time he spent within the Mayan Zone, Leonel had spent practically all his time on Earth since Invalids had appeared with Aina. In addition, when he was in the Mayan Zone, Aina had either been unconscious or within her own Zone.\nSince Invalids didn't appear within Zones, at least with Leonel's current comprehension, it was impossible that Aina had met this Variant Invalid.\nOf course, this was all deduced under the speculation that Earth didn't have Invalids before the Metamorphosis descended. Leonel felt that this was a fine assumption to make, even when considering the fact Aina came from a hidden family of Earth.\nInvalids were just humans who failed to awaken their abilities and thus lost their consciousness. Variant Invalids were just Invalids who managed to reawaken their consciousnesses. But, by then, they would no longer be the version of themselves they once were.\nUnless…\n'Does Aina know this Invalid from when it was a human?'\nLeonel pouted slightly, mostly because from what he could see, despite the odd coloration of its skin, this Variant Invalid was quite a handsome young man.\nLeonel shook his head. This wasn't the time to be thinking of such things.\nHe looked back toward Aina. \"Do you want to leave and come back another time? From the flow of battle, I doubt that this Invalid horde will be able to breech the walls during this wave. They'll likely need two or three more attempts.\"\nAina looked toward Leonel. She could tell that Leonel sensed something amiss about her reaction earlier and wanted to take some pressure off of her. But…\n\"No.\"\nAina's voice came out somewhat coldly. In fact, her demeanor somewhat shocked Leonel. She sounded as though he had said something to enrage her.\nAina looked away from Leonel's surprised gaze, not saying anything further.\nThe little mink peeked over her shoulder as she faced away, sticking out his little pink tongue toward Leonel.\n'…'\nLeonel was really at a loss this time.\n**\nMiles Leum.\nHis life should have been perfect. He was the Heir to one of the few most powerful families of Earth. He was already given the Junior Governor Duke title by his father. He awakened an S-grade ability that granted him power and strength in addition to the status he was born with.\nHowever, ever since that matter of several months ago, everything had been going downhill.\nHe had expected that upon reporting these matters to his father, he would gain control of the resources he needed to hunt Leonel down and end all of this. But, not only did he not gain the support he expected, his power in the province was restricted even more than it originally was.\nAs things stood now, Secretary Marquisette Maia was effectively the leader of the Province despite the fact she never seemed to be around. Despite this, she somehow managed to oversee everything and even the small tricks he tried to play to gain back power were snuffed out by her with a casual thought.\nMiles could hardly believe it all. His father had actually chosen to abandon his heir in favor of an old woman masquerading as a young beauty.\nMaybe the worst part about all of this was that he was slowly being ostracized.\nDue to the matter of him bombing his own citizens, a scapegoat needed to be trotted out. Miles understood this, it was just that he never expected that the scapegoat would actually be himself.\nThe nobles painted him as an immature, rash individual who was too young to be fit to lead, or ever lead, for that matter. This caused him to lose a great amount of influence.\nThis would have been fine under normal conditions. After all, the title of Duke was hereditary, at least historically. The issue was that… The title of Governor Duke wasn't so simple.\nDuring the transition of power between father and son, though Miles would have an inside track as his father's chosen heir, he would still need to fend off competitors. This blend of hereditary titles and democracy was how The Empire continued to breed talents.\nThough one would be hard pressed to say that The Empire were the 'good guys', one thing you couldn't say was that it had incompetent nobles. Any family that raised incompetent Heirs would just as quickly lose their status as nobles.\nDue to this, there were no shortage of prosperous, once-royal, families, looking to claw their way back up to the top. So, a position like Miles' was constantly being eyed.\nIt was no surprise then that Miles was wracking his brain, trying to find a way to claim back what was his. But, rather than good news, everything only became worse.\nJust a few months ago, he learned that Maia was pregnant.\nBack on 21st Century Earth, this would mean the end of a woman's career for at least a couple months. However, in modern times, it was as easy as breathing for Maia to have her embryo transplanted out of her body and into a machine that could nurture her baby far better than even her own body could.\nThis seemed like a useless tidbit of information, but Miles was almost certain that this child was his father's.\nIf his conjectures were correct… he was finished.\nThis reality left Miles, who once sat atop of the world, in a tailspin.",

      "content": "Children were rare. After the Metamorphosis, those children who had been born before it Descended were highly likely to die. And, during the Metamorphosis… who had time to have children?\nMany were too busy fighting for their lives. And, even when they wanted to lose themselves in pleasure with a partner, who would want to bring a child into this world?\nThe contraceptive methods of these modern times were so good that 100% effectiveness wouldn't be an exaggeration in the slightest.\nHowever, it was precisely because of this that many had forgotten one important detail.\nAs talented as the children born before the Metamorphosis were… How much more talented would the ones being born after it be?\nMiles had awakened an S-grade talent. His father was a Variant. Secretary Marquisette Maia had awakened an A-grade talent.\nWith the genes this child would have, Miles had little faith that this baby would be untalented. In fact, there was a good chance that this half-brother of his would be far more talented than himself.\nMiles realized something else as well…\nOriginally, his father was slowly fading out of his prime. It wouldn't have been more than a decade or two before he was forced to hand down his position. But, in this new world order, his father might even live doubly as long as he once would have.\nUnder such conditions, why would he have to rush to pick an Heir?\nAll of these matters made Miles feel as though the walls were crashing down upon him. No matter what he did, he was forced into a deeper and deeper corner.\nHe lost contact with his biological mother. His father's conversations with him were short and detached. And, even his friendship with Simeon and the connection he had gained to the hidden families seemed strained now.\nIt was at his darkest hour that Earth suddenly descended into chaos and the Invalids began to attack.\nAt first they repelled them and thought that would be the end of it. However, a first wave became a second and a third.\nIt was then they realized that Invalids shouldn't have a concept of retreat. The only way for them to 'repel' a wave would be by killing them all, but obviously, they hadn't done so.\nAt this point, they came to the shocking realization that these Invalids were… being controlled.\nFor the first time, Miles saw a lit pathway out of his current situation. The more chaotic it became, the greater chance he would have.\nIf he could use this opportunity to not only fix his image, but to also find an opportunity to find where Maia was hiding her embryo to kill it before it grew, he might have a chance at recovering in his father's eye.\nMaia might have held all the status now, but her ability was absolutely useless in combat. All she could do was maintain her youthful looks, her combat prowess was worse than even someone with an F-grade ability.\nThis sort of situation was the perfect time for Miles to seize control. But, he needed an opportunity. If he acted too fast and without cause, his actions would end up being more of an impediment to what he was doing. If he wanted to turn things around he had to be patient.\nSo, that was what he did.\nDay after day, he waited, not lifting a finger. At this point, even those nobles who had expected him to make a move by now couldn't help but grow curious about what his plans were. But, Miles continued to bide his time.\nFrom the actions of this Variant Invalid, he could tell that it wanted this Fort. As for the reason it wanted it, Miles wasn't sure. Maybe it wanted the population of humans within, maybe it wanted to use this place as a base to consolidate its power, or maybe it was a combination of both. But, regardless, as long as this Variant was persistent, that was all that mattered to Miles.\n…\nAt that moment, during what was the third wave, Miles sat in his office. Even though he was safely tucked away near the core of the city, he could still hear the bombardment of the military units.\nHe sat silently, sipping a cup of tea.\n\"Come in.\" He said neither too quickly, nor slowly.\nSomething about his demeanor breathed calm into his surroundings. Even when pressed into a corner, he still maintained the air of a noble.\nWith a light click, the door opened to reveal a familiar young man. If Leonel was here to see his tall frame and playboy-like features, he would immediately recognize this young man as his former best friend, James.\n\"Do you have something to report?\" Miles took another sip of his tea.\nThough his words were measured and calm, there was a hint of warning within them. He was trying to maintain a low profile. Having meetings like this might be fine since both he and James were both youths of similar age, but if they happened too frequently and without reason, others would begin to raise their guards.\nJames calmly faced Miles. In comparison to Fin and Thorn who had been quaking before their superiors, he was clearly a large measure better in this regard.\n\"My father sent me here to report that the noble council is beginning to think of more unconventional strategies to deal with the horde once and for all. If things continue like this, the Variant Invalid will only continue to regroup and attack. During these discussions, the potential of using your abilities to set up a wide range illusion field came up.\"\nMiles' gaze sharpened. \"Who brought this topic up?\"\n\"There's no need to worry, Junior Governor Duke. It wasn't my father who brought this idea forward.\"\n\"Good, good.\" Miles' lip curled.\nIf it was one of his potential allies that brought this idea forward, there wouldn't have been much of a point in him lying low for so long. Allowing things to progress organically in this fashion was for the best.\n\"And Secretary Marquisette Maia's opinion?\"\n\"She was once again absent of the council gathering.\" James replied.\nMiles' brow furrowed slightly. He didn't know why Maia was always disappearing like this. But, this was ultimately good for him. He didn't know how she managed to keep a rein on power while being absent so frequently, but Miles was certain she wouldn't be able to replicate this indefinitely. Eventually, she would pay a price for her absence.\n\"Alright, leave things as is for now, don't push too hard unnecessarily. You can go.\"\nJames nodded and turned to leave.\n\"Hold on.\" Miles suddenly called out.\n\"The matter of Conrad Siegfried.\"\nJames froze but didn't reply, waiting for what Miles wanted to say.\nIf Leonel had been there, he would have immediately recognized this name. Conrad… He was the same man who almost dropped James out of a window and the very same man Aina killed with her own hands right before Leonel.\n\"We put a lot of effort to pull in that wastrel from the Siegfried family, but he ended up dying.\" Miles said plainly. \"In the past it didn't matter much. Becoming allies with the White Angel Province's Governor Duke family might have been a plus, but not a necessity. But now, it's far more important than it once was…\n\"To now, the Siegfried family still doesn't know how their son died, right?\" Miles asked slowly.\nJames shook his head.\nThey didn't know. To now, they probably still thought Conrad died in a Zone or beneath the claws of some Invalids.\nBut, it went to show how little they cared about this son. Despite knowing the Metamorphosis was coming, they didn't even stop him from playing in the National Championship game.\n\"You said that he was killed by that Aina girl the Simeon came to get, right?\" A smile creeped up on Miles' face.\nThe Brazinger family wanted to abandon him, huh? Since that was the case, he'd spin a nice little web.\nFor such a powerful family, such a thing would hardly be enough to inconvenience them… In normal times that is. Miles knew some things many didn't due to his relationship with Simeon. He might as well use them to his advantage.\nJames nodded somewhat more stiffly this time and turned to leave again. This time, Miles didn't stop him.\nSoon, the third wave ended and days later, the fourth began. Without a choice, the council of nobles called Miles forward.\nThe Junior Governor Duke took his first step toward reclaiming his lost status.",

      "content": "Miles stood atop the Royal Blue Fort walls, taking a deep breath. To him, the air felt fresher than it had in a long time.\nThough he was a youth used to warm weather, there was something about this heavy snow that made him smile.\nAt that moment, Miles suddenly felt a cold shiver tremble his heart. His eyes snapped in a certain direction, only to find a blue-eyed Variant looking toward him, a quirky smile curving its lips. The look in combination with its inhumanly white skin and hair made Miles' gaze narrowed.\nThis Invalid was teasing him?\nAll this time, the Variant Invalid had never made a move to attack personally. It stood at the back of the army casually observing everything from afar.\nOf course, this wasn't for lack of attempts by the Fort. However, any targeted assault toward the Variant Invalid seemed to always lead in failure. It simply had too many guards around it.\nThe most powerful warriors of this Invalid army were all definitely concentrated around this white-skinned Invalid.\n\"Begin the bombardment sequence.\" Miles maintained eye contact with the Invalid as he barked out this order coldly.\nIn truth, he wasn't the commander of this mission, but he took charge. The general that was meant to act the head and the soldiers beneath him wouldn't dare to ignore his commands regardless. Since that was the case, he exuded an air of superiority, speaking with an undeniable air of leadership.\nThe canons whirred to life. Due to the situation, they had deployed the Force Disruption Towers in the outer city as well. Compared to the past, their weaponry couldn't even be compared as night and day.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nA volley soared through the air, leaving a trail of black smoke and burning winds in its wake.\nThousands of Invalids were taken out with every shot. It would have been a massacre that chilled the hearts had it not been for the fact these mindless beasts didn't even seem to register the fall of their comrades. They only continued to listen to the orders of their leader, charging forward without thought of fatigue, pain or unwillingness.\nHowever, the point of this volley wasn't to wipe them all out to begin with.\n\"Open the gates.\"\nMiles issued his second command seeing that they had cleared out enough space.\nBeneath the city wall, a troop of soldiers stood with hardened faces. This was the first time a legion was being sent out to deal with the Invalids directly, how could they not be serious?\nAmong this troop, there were a few familiar faces, though.\nWithin the vanguard, there was a large man with sharp features. Despite his large belly, his body exuded a solid and powerful feeling. He was the kind of man who rippled with muscles despite the fat that covered most of his body.\nThis man was Milan, Leonel's Center. Anyone who understood the rules of ancient game of American Football knew how close the relationship between a quarterback and his center was. However, it had already been almost a year since the last time Leonel had seen the big guy.\nIn that time, he had grown. Milan's usually jovial smile was nowhere to be seen. His gaze exuded a cold light, the same cold it glowed when he faced the defensive line of the opposing team on the football field.\nBeside Milan there was a second familiar face.\nHe was a tall black man wielded a halberd with a two-meter-long polearm. He had had not just a few battles with Leonel during their practice sessions back at Royal Blue Academy.\nWhile Milan's jovial laughter was nowhere to be seen, Joel's kind gaze had vanished as well. He looked like a hunter prowling tall grasses for his pray.\nBehind these two, several of Leonel's teammates stood having regrouped. The aura they all exuded was suffocating.\nAfter years playing beneath Leonel's leadership, their sharpness was refined to inconceivable levels. Even now, facing enemies the likes of which they never had before, they still moved as one.\nAll this time, Miles was forced to lay low. Dealing with his own problems, when could he have had time to cause trouble for Leonel's teammates and friends?\nHowever, it was impossible for the former Royal Blue squad to know of this. Having lost their connection to James, their understanding of the nobles had plummeted. As a result, they took pre-emptive action to protect themselves.\nThough they were still a bit young to do so, they all joined the army. No matter how bold Miles was, he wouldn't dare to casually take action against service members. The backlash he would receive in doing so would be far beyond anything he was enduring now.\nSo, here they were, facing the opening gates of the Fort, their auras resonating as one.\nIn a distant corner of the city, Yuri watched all of this in silence. No one had time to bother with a teenage girl after Aina and Leonel disappeared. In fact, she remained in the same home within the core city she had once shared with Aina. It was as though everyone had forgotten about her.\nShe waited patiently, seemingly knowing that Aina would be back to get her eventually.\nBANG!\nThe Gates suddenly stopped moving.\n\"CHARGE!\"\nMilan's voice billowed, his belly rumbling with an inconceivable strength as he projected an air of confidence.\nThe troops of about a hundred shot out like an iron ball out a barrel.\nJoel lowered his halberd to the ground, pulling out a handgun from his waist he fired. His gaze tinged a slight red as he mowed down Invalids with a cold efficiency.\nIf a football fan saw him in his current state, they'd roar out that Headhunter Joel had returned.\nEvery one of his bullets travelled through an Invalid's head, his speed causing one's heart to tremble.\nMilan stood at the helm of the troops, his chest and belly flaring outward. A towering energy shield appeared before their vanguard, protecting them from all sorts of long-range ability Invalids.\nA third of Leonel's teammates stepped forward. He was a man even larger than Milan. He stood a full head taller, but his body didn't ripple with muscle like the latter's. In fact, any ripple it had could only be described as undulating fat, waving about his body like a tsunami.\nThis teammate had brown skin and a red line down his forehead. He was the left tackle of the Royal Blue football team, the protector of Leonel's blindside, Raj.\nHe stamped down a foot hard causing the ground to undulate. At that moment, the thick sheets of ice shattered, clearing the path of slippery death traps and causing several Invalids to lose their footing.\n\"Forward!\" Milan roared.\nFrom the top of the city walls, Miles watched all of this with narrowed eyes. The truth was that he didn't even know who these men were. In his mind, he was only thinking about how to bring such a powerful squad under his control, having no idea why such a squad was formed in the first place…\nMiles placed this thought to the back of his mind. It was time for him to act.\n\"First phase is complete. Commence with the second!\"",

      "content": "Miles stepped to the edge of the walls, taking a deep breath. A strong surge of Force whipped around him, forming rainbow-colored clouds around his body.\nThe rainbow clouds continued to grow in size, blanketing the area around Miles at ever-increasing speeds.\nAs the battle below raged on, it was hard for anyone to take notice of such a phenomenon. Many weren't qualified to do so. Though rainbow clouds should have been something that captured the awe of all, the truth was that most didn't have the affinity necessary to sense them because…\nThey were formed of Dream Force.\nBy this point, it couldn't be more obvious why it was that Miles' ability was useless against Leonel. The former had an ability reliant on a Force that practically bowed down to the latter.\nThe clouds eventually grew from covering just a few tens of meters to over several hundred. Very quickly, it covered over a kilometer.\nMiles had been able to cast an illusion over tens of kilometers worth of city. This much was most definitely possible for him. The only question was whether or not he would have the time he needed to do it.\nBut, there were two things working in his favor. The first was the Invalids were too far from him and most of them likely weren't even aware of what he was doing. And, the second reason was as the Descent of the Fourth Dimension accelerated toward completion, Miles could slowly feel his ability strengthening and growing.\nNow, whereas it would have taken him several hours to reach this level in the past, it only took him a little over half an hour to reach this point.\nMiles' gaze flashed open, the troops below were still battling, but they had fallen into a stalemate. But, this was perfect, this was exactly the situation they wanted.\nThe reason they were in a stalemate wasn't because their momentum had stalled, but rather because they were pacing themselves to maintain their stamina for a final push.\nWithin the vanguard, Milan, Joel and Raj manned the core. Joel became their main source of attack, Milan was their defense, and Raj was their crowd control. They worked together seamlessly, waiting for the perfect opportunity to lash out.\nOn the football field, and in any sport, for that matter, momentum was an important but abstract concept. Yet, as a team that rarely if ever lost, the Royal Blue squad had a perfect grasp of it. When it was time… they would be ready.\nThe rainbow clouds blanketed the battlefield at that very moment. For the first time, the troops could see them clearly.\nThe Invalids began to act erratically, their senses being completely cut off.\nMiles' ability had many different uses. Just like Simeon, he was able to slowly learn about it over time and refine it.\nThough he could weave intricate illusions, doing so used too much of his stamina and took even more time. However, if he broke down the illusions into their individual parts, he was able to gain sometimes even better results for a smaller sacrifice.\nFor example, it was possible for him to target particular senses.\nIn order for an illusion to work, Miles had to ensure that all five senses were accounted for. Whether it was touch, smell, sight… it all had to be perfect or else the illusion could collapse.\nBut, likewise, this meant that Miles could hone in on specific parameters and tweak them to his liking,\nHe could target touch and make the same amount of pain feel ten times worse. He could target scent and force even the most veteran of hunting dogs into a corner. He could target sight and make a person feel as though they had been blinded, never to see anything ever again…\nThis was what abilities could do. The possibilities were endless as long as one had the creativity and talent to accomplish it.\nWhen Miles experiments were taken to their logical extreme, he created an entirely new technique. And he called it…\n\"Sensory Domain.\"\nMiles' gaze blazed.\nWithin his Sensory Domain, everyone was under his control. He could strip a person of all their feeling. Their sense of touch, sight, hearing, smell and even taste, he could snatch them all.\nAnd that was exactly what he did.\nIn that instant, the Invalids became a complete mess. They couldn't see what enemies they were targeting, they couldn't hear where they were coming from, either. Only those who had relatively sharp senses could use their sense of Force to make out where the troops were and target a general direction, but even then, there were too few of them.\n'If I could cut of proprioception and the ability to sense Force, I would be undefeatable…'\n[Author's Note: Proprioception is the ability of a person to tell where their body parts are in relation to one another. If someone lost this ability, even walking would be impossible. Doing practically anything would be impossible, actually. Well, not impossible, just very, very, very difficult]\nMiles ambition seemed endless. Even with such a powerful ability, he wasn't satisfied. However, he had done his part.\n\"Commence Phase Three!\"\nMiles barked out order after order. Everything was going smoothly. In fact, any dissatisfaction the Commander had had after having his post stolen was wiped away. Miles' commands were perfect and well timed.\nIt was clear that there were no pushovers among noble Heirs…\nThe Fort gates opened once again. But, this time, a worker's crew of engineers shot out instead of a group of warriors. They all hung on to the sides of trucks packed to the brim with several steel cases.\nThe trucks came to a stop quickly and the engineers all rushed out, opening box after box.\nVery soon, it because obvious what they were doing. They were building something.\nThose with the knowledge could tell exactly what these 'somethings' were as well…\nForce Disruption Towers!\nIf the Third Phase succeeded, the Invalid army would be finished. Having to face the brunt of human technology without Force only led toward one path…\nDeath.",

      "content": "The engineers got to work with an avid quickness. Though they were assured that everything was under control, these men and women were ultimately used to lives spent in labs and private work stations. Something like a battlefield was completely foreign to them.\nThough they had had some run-ins with danger on their way to the Fort, it had already been over a year since then. They had gotten used to their lives of comfort and leisure again.\nMany of them weren't even willing to be here. But, they had lost the luck of the draw, so this was their only remaining option.\nIt was no surprise, then, that many of them would be shaking and quaking as they worked. But, luckily, there was the vanguard of troops protecting them from all sides. As they noticed they weren't in any danger, they were able to work faster and faster.\n…\nIn the distance, Leonel and Aina watched all of this in silence. It had already been a few days since they began to monitor the Fort, so they were quite used to the flow of things. However, this plan the Fort sprung was completely out of their expectations as well.\nAina seemed to still be mad at Leonel and spent all her time cuddling with Little Blackstar. As though that wasn't bad enough, even Little Tolly betrayed him as well.\nUsually, Little Tolly could only interact with Leonel due to the hazard it presented. But, who knew when the little guy got intelligent enough to steal Leonel's Force Crafter Gloves and pass them over toward Aina.\nSomehow, both his partners favored Aina more than him.\nThough Aina was still mad at him, Leonel couldn't help but chuckle at this.\nDidn't this just mean he had excellent taste? Of course his woman would be beloved by all.\n\"Ah…\"\nLeonel's breath hitched when Aina turned back to glare at him. It couldn't be that she heard his thoughts, right? Her gaze seemed to spit fire as though saying 'who's your woman'?\nLeonel's father had always warned him that a woman's intuition was scary, but he never really believed it. Back then, Leonel thought his mother had ditched them so he never trusted his father when it came to advice about women. What would an old man who couldn't even keep his own wife know about that topic?\nNow that Leonel thought about it, his old man had told him a long time ago to stop confessing to Aina and that she probably thought he was annoying. Eventually, he just started making fun of him for all his failures.\n'… Damned old man.' Leonel thought to himself while smiling innocently toward Aina.\nSuddenly, Leonel frowned.\n'Milan… Joel… Raj…'\nLeonel's jaw turned steely.\nAina seemed to sense the change in Leonel's demeanor and looked toward the battlefield. At that moment, the Gate was opening and a few familiar faces charged out.\nIn the past, Aina had only ever gone to a single one of Leonel's games. And, even if she had gone to more, everyone on the team wore helmets most of the time. So, she didn't recognize most of them. However, Milan and Joel had been with them on their trip toward the Fort.\nSeeing them, she immediately knew what Leonel was thinking. Did Miles force them to do this?\nLeonel's expression became cold. His gaze locked onto the battlefield, not moving a single inch away. Even the smallest detail didn't escape his sights.\nA pressure slowly built around his body, but he didn't make a move. What if Miles acted like he had before and forgot everything for the sake of killing him? Even if Leonel himself might be able to survive the bombardment now, that didn't mean that he would always be able to. In addition, what about the others?\nSo, Leonel waited.\nWhen he saw the engineers come out and begin to build the Force Disrupting Towers, he took note of it all.\nTo his side, Aina rose from her squat near the ground. On her back, the massive curved box that carried her ax was there. But, in her hands, a great sword took the stage as her main weapon. Something told her she would have to move soon.\n…\nOn the ground the battle had fallen into a state of one sided dominance. However, Milan controlled the pace of the vanguard, not allowing them to rush forward without reason. Their main priority was to protect the engineers. Once the towers were complete, they'd be able to drown these Invalids in bullets of the highest quality.\nThe morale of the troops were exceptionally high. Their casualties were near zero and the engineers looked as though they might finish at any time. The longer they worked, the more comfortable they got and the faster they moved.\nHowever, all this time, Milan felt an itchiness to the back of his neck. It was the same feeling he got when the opponent was coming with a sudden exotic blitz. As the center of a football team, it was his job to point out protections and adjust to the onslaught of the opponent. In some cases, his decision trumped even Leonel's.\nThey say that the quarterback was the most important position on the field, but the offensive line was the most important group on the field.\n\"Defensive positions!\" Milan roared, his rounded gut becoming almost like a steel cap. It flexed with such power that it seemed he wanted to break through Miles' sensory block.\nThe head of the vanguard was mostly constructed of Leonel's teammates. Hearing such words, they didn't hesitate to move. Their influence caused others to listen as well. There were only very few who lagged behind. But, even they rushed over as they followed with the crowd.\nMilan had been the ancor to their defenses all this time. There was no way they would snub his command without reason or cause.\nAt that moment, on the top of the walls, Miles, who had been quietly observing everything suddenly felt uncomfortable as well because…\nThe Variant Invalid's smile still hadn't faded. In fact, it continued to look at him from start to finish as though observing something that made it curious.\nThe white-skinned Invalids smile suddenly became a grin. Its handsome face distorted, revealing a jagged row of teeth.\nIt's mouth outgrew its body in the blink of an eye. Soon after, its entire body more, enlarging and sprouting what felt like mountains of white fur.\nWhat once was a handsome young man became a towering wolf that was easily half the height of the tall steel walls of the Royal Blue Fort.\nIts jagged teeth shone beneath the drifting snow.\n\"ROOOAAARRR!\"\nThe snowy ground quaked and the snowfall became ten times heavier. Whipping cold winds tore through the surroundings, kicking up even the wet snow and sending it jetting outward.\nIt took just a single roar. And just like that, Miles' Sensory Domain collapsed.",

      "content": "Milan's expression hardened.\nThe lost Invalids suddenly grew focused once more. Whereas they hadn't had any direction in the past, they could now see their targets.\nMiles hadn't expected such a thing to happen. He had thought that his ability was infallible. He had considered the possibility that his ability could be ignored by some powerful existences with stronger minds. But, he hadn't ever thought that it would be possible to dispel its effects on others in this fashion.\nIn truth, this lack of preparation could only be blamed on Miles himself. Ultimately, any Force based ability was reliant on Force to manifest itself – obviously. In such a case, this meant that a greater Force could always force it to collapse.\nOne might think of how scared others were of the Dream Abode in Brave City and assume Dream Force to be infallible, but this couldn't have been further from the case.\nThe reason even Emperors without the appropriate affinity didn't dare to approach the Dream Abode wasn't because of the Dream Force alone, per se, but rather because of its sheer quantity.\nThe Abode represented a vast store of Dream Force. Even Leonel, with his talent, couldn't even begin to deplete it during his breakthrough, let alone someone without an affinity to speak of, or a person with a much weaker affinity like Miles.\nHowever, if Leonel were to try to replicate the abilities of the Dream Abode himself – without its support – he would end up dying from exhaustion before he could cause the likes of Anared or JIlniya to feel threatened.\nAnd in such a case… How could the stores and strength of a Variant Invalid not absolutely crush someone with a mere S-grade ability like Miles?\nThe white wolf stood at over five meters tall, its majestic coat and mane whipping about beneath its strength.\nIts low growl crawled over the battlefield, sinking into the hearts of all those who heard it.\nAt that moment, the 12 guards around the Variant Invalid all shot forward at once. Their reserved auras surged out like a tidal wave, each and every one of them carrying an ice type ability. It was clear that the Variant Invalid had hand selected its guard and not a single one of them was below the SSS-grade.\n'Shit.'\nThis was the only word Milan could think of. He could feel that the engineers had begun to panic. Any speed they had gained from growing comfortable plummeted. Whereas it might have only taken them 10 more minutes to finish before, now it wouldn't be surprising for it to take another half hour.\nAt such a pace, they were screwed. Even if it was just ten minutes left, they would be doubtful to finish.\nMiles watched all of this from the top of the city walls, his gaze turning steely. This was likely his final chance and he couldn't act rashly either.\n\"Order the retreat.\" Miles said after some deliberation.\nThe Commander sighed a breath of relief. He had expected Miles to close the gates and leave them all out there to rot. This would have been very much in line with Miles' usual actions.\nHowever, Miles knew that he was on a short leash. As much as he didn't want to risk the city by leaving the gates open for a second longer, if he abandoned them outside without even trying, any prestige he had managed to scrounge up would collapse once again.\n\"RETREAT!\"\nThe scrambling engineers felt as though they had heard the most beautiful word to ever exist. They didn't hesitate to abandon their work. In fact, they didn't even bother to pack everything back up again.\nThey rushed to the sides of the trucks that brought them here, clamboring into the open trunks and hanging off the sides to the best of their ability.\nMany of them started screaming for the drivers to go before the rest of their colleagues even stepped forward. It was clear that in such a mind state, the 30 minute deadline was far too optimistic. They had already lost all will to fight.\nAt that moment, the 12 ice guards had reached Milan's vanguard. Having no choice but to protect the retreat of the engineers, they manned the rear.\nMilan's large belly flexed once again, his strength pouring out and forming another shield of Force. Veins popped across his forehead as he layered the shield again and again. He knew that against such enemies, just one was far from enough.\nHis ability might have been similar to James', but James' ability was of the A-grade while his was C-grade. Though in the past year Milan managed to progress it to the B-grade… what was that in the face of so many SSS-grade threats?\nBANG!\nMilan's efforts were shattered in the blink of an eye.\nRaj slammed his feet to the ground in an attempt to slow their approach, but the ice guards reacted even faster, a sharp Ice Elemental Force surging around them as the froze the ground beneath their feet solid.\nNo matter how hard Raj tried, he couldn't seem to cause another earthen wave. He could only raise his assault rifle and begin to fire madly, the recoil of the hefty gun causing his fat to undulate once again.\n\"We'll cover, retreat!\" Milan roared.\nHe, Joel and Raj unloaded their clips.\nThey no longer cared about reserving supplies or their strength. Their only thoughts were of covering for their teammates. Among those who had been forced to join the army as a veil of protection from Miles, there were a few so young that Coach Owen hadn't even allowed them to see the field. Yet now, they were thrust into the middle of war.\n\"Dammit, rookie! If I can see your face instead of you hauling ass within the next second I'm gonna put a bullet in your kneecap!\" Milan roared.\n\"Forget a kneecap, I'll lodge one in your ass if you don't make it to the gate in under five!\" Joel barked right after.\nThey might haze these rookies and give them a hard time, but when it came down to it, it was their role as seniors to protect.\nThey could sense the hesitation of their teammates, but not everyone could stay behind. What would be the point of their decision then?\nThe three shooed them away, their roars being half drowned out by their rain of bullets. It didn't matter if they worked, all they cared about was slowing them down by an extra minute, an extra second, an extra step.\n\"Fuck, since you like the cold so much, go to hell!\"\nRaj ripped a grenade from his hip and bit the pin off. He threw it with all his might, watching as it rebounded off the iced ground and toward the ice guards.\n\"Raj, hell is hot.\" Joel mumbled.\n\"Fuck, that just means these damned popsicles'll be melted into a puddle of their own piss!\"\nThe three men laughed, their bullets never stopping.. In the back of their minds, they seemed aware it would be impossible to retreat with everyone else.",

      "content": "BANG! BANG!\nThe grenade erupted, blasting bits and pieces of dirt, hot air and shrapnel in every direction.\nA massive cloud of white shot up from the core of the explosion. But, before anyone could even sigh a breath of relief, an ice guard shot out from the dust cloud, gliding across ice of its own creation like a silent assassin.\n'Shit.'\nJoel brandished his halberd, the trigger of his rifle echoing a hollow click.\nHe tossed the useless gun to the side, gathering his courage as his hands gripped his weapon's polearm.\nMilan pulled a heavy shield from his back, slamming it hard against the iced grounds and standing shoulder to shoulder to Raj.\nRaj moved to bite off another grenade's pin, only to see the remaining 11 ice guards shoot out from the cloud of smoke. What was the point? The grenades were useless anyway…\n\"ROOOOOOARRR!!\"\nAnother roar shook the battlefield.\nThe Variant Invalid stalked forward. By this point, the engineers had only just reached the gate once again. As for the troops who could only move on foot, they were still over 50 meters away. Unfortunately, in these conditions, many of them were having trouble finding stable ground to stand on.\nThe white wolf crouched, its powerful limbs shattering the ice beneath its feet.\nBANG!\nIn this new world order, there were many sights the common people could have never dreamed of seeing in the past that they could experience now. Watching as a five meter tall and almost ten meter long wolf cross hundreds of meters in the blink of an eye… was definitely one of those things.\nA massive shadow seemed to swallow the sun.\nJoel looked at the halberd in his hands while Milan and Raj looked toward their shields. Then, they looked toward one another, bitter smiles on their faces.\nAt that moment, they heard a rain of bullets coming from their back, only to look and find that at least a dozen of the almost hundred troops they had led the vanguard with hadn't retreated and were now shooting toward the massive wolf in the air.\nMilan opened his mouth to reprimand them. He knew these men well, they were the same teammates he had shared a field with for so many years. One of them was even a rookie of barely 15 years old. However, he didn't even have the time to do this much.\nTo the front, the ice guards had reached them.\nJoel stabbed out with his halberd, only to find it snapped in two before he could even complete his first pierce.\nMilan and Raj stood as shields before him, their feet digging into the slippery ground as they tried to give Joel some cover.\nBut, just as quickly as they tried to form a line of defense, they were sent flying back and crashing into Joel.\nBANG!\nIn that instant, the Variant Invalid wolf landed on the ground, causing it to quake. It didn't even spare a glance toward Milan and the others as it looked toward the wall, a toothy, sinister, snarling grin lining its snout.\nMilan and Raj coughed violently, feeling as though all the bones in their body had been broken. They struggled to stand, looking toward the ice guards and white wolf with a hint of fear in their eyes.\nThey felt as though this was all a play orchestrated by the white wolf. With such strength, with such leaping ability, couldn't it have claimed the Fort for itself long ago…? Why did it wait until now…? They simply didn't have anyone capable of stopping it.\nMiles watched everything from above, his jaw clenched.\n\"Close the gates!\"\nThe harsh words grated on the ears, but it was clear by now that Miles had shown enough mercy. Even if his enemies wanted to use this to point out his weaknesses, he had plenty of evidence on his side.\nThis was all he cared about. As long as the optics were in his favor, that was all that mattered.\nBy now, the trucks had already crossed through the Gates. The only ones lagging behind were the running soldiers who had had to retreat by foot.\nAs they watched the Gate slowly close, those too far away felt a bout of despair while those who felt they still had a chance pushed their bodies to the limits, driving themselves forward as fast they could.\nUnfortunately, the ground was in terrible condition. Where there was no snow was too easy for even the most coordinated of men to slip and fall. And, where there was snow weighed down the legs of those trying to escape, easily halving their speed.\nBANG!\nThe Gates slammed shut. By now, only half the hundred troops that had come managed to make it back. As for those who were close, they banged on the steely gates with despair ringing from their voices.\nTheir efforts resounded like dull thuds. The Gates were too think and too solid. Even if one stood on the opposite side, it would have been impossible to hear a thing.\nAll this time, the white wolf watched without even attempting to stop them. It raised its head haughtily, emitting the air of a King of Beasts.\n\"Concentrate your fire!\" Miles barked out an order.\nThe bombardment of artillery shells had maybe been the only reason the tactical unit hadn't been completely surrounded and wiped out by Invalids. But now that Miles had ordered for them to concentrate their fire onto the white wolf, what chance did they stand anymore?\nAt that moment, a rookie helped Milan to stand while a few others helped Joel and Raj.\nMilan opened his mouth to yell at the rookie once more, but the breaks to his ribs caused him to wince. In the end, he sighed. Was there a point in yelling anymore?\n\"Damned kid, we already told you not to join the army, but you didn't listen. Now you don't even listen to my orders. Why you all do such stupid things is beyond me.\"\nMilan shook his head. Though the white wolf was ignoring them now, that wasn't out of mercy. Would you care much about an ant you could crush any time you wanted?\nWhile Milan was lost in his thoughts, though, he didn't expect the rookie who helped him up to actually respond to his words.\nLooking forward seriously, the scrawny little guy in an oversized military uniform and helmet stood straight with his underdeveloped chest sticking out as far as he could force it to.\n\"Respect the game. Persist to the end!\"\nMilan was stunned out of his thoughts. For a moment, he could sense a sliver of Leonel's overbearing aura.\nA sudden laughter rocked the battlefield. Whether it was Joel, Raj or Milan, their gazes went red without even having to look in the direction it came from.\n\"Well said, rookie!\"\nIt was only then that Milan realized it wasn't an illusion.. He really had sensed it.",

      "content": "Leonel suddenly manifested from thin air, his appearance causing no small number of people a great deal of shock.\nA wide grin spread across his face as he looked toward his teammates. Any rage he had been feeling vanished, replaced by a gratification he had yet to feel in his life before.\n\"Captain!\"\nThey didn't have time to think about how Leonel had suddenly appeared here, or how he was somehow already blocking the path between them and the white wolf.\nAfter registering that Leonel was actually here, the faces of his teammates changed wildly.\n\"What the hell are you doing here?\"\n\"Are you trying to die?!\"\nThe whirring of the canons atop the walls never stopped. The truth was that from the vantage of those up above, it was impossible to hear even their screams, let alone noticing the sudden appearance of a single person on such a large battlefield.\nEven now, no one but those on the ground had noticed the addition of Leonel. Of course, among those that noticed included the Variant Invalid and its ice guards. However, surprisingly, from start to finish, Leonel's back faced them.\nIt was as though he was showing the same disregard for the white wolf that it had shown to his teammates.\nWho cared about when you stomped an ant as long as it was done?\nThis sort of air of confidence was something the white wolf hadn't sensed from an enemy during this war. Such a feeling caused its toothy grin to become more sinister, carrying a more bloodthirsty air to it.\nLeonel patted the rookie's shoulder. \"What's your name?\"\nAs part of the hazing ritual of their football team, every rookie was only known by exactly that title. They didn't have the right to have their own names until they passed through a year of initiation. It was only after this that they were allowed to have their own identities once again.\nSo, when the rookie heard Leonel ask such a question, he immediately went teary eyed.\nTechnically, he should have already passed through initiation a long time ago. But, due to the various circumstances surrounding the Metamorphosis, he had been stuck in his role as a rookie for over double the time he should have been.\nHowever, somehow hearing Leonel's words made it all worth it.\n\"My name is Drake, Captain!\"\nLeonel smiled. \"You did a good job, Drake. Supporting your brothers is exactly what a man should do. But, remember in the future to only do things within your means, do you understand?\"\nDrake stared blankly at Leonel before lowering his head like a wronged child.\nLeonel shook his head and patted Drake's shoulder again.\n\"Though things worked out this time, you also have to realize that your seniors wanted to sacrifice themselves for your benefit. If your life wasn't saved in the end, then wouldn't their sacrifice have been for nothing?\"\nDrake's gaze lit up with understanding. But, because he was looking at the ground, no one noticed.\nStill, Leonel felt that he had said enough. Anymore would just be beating a dead horse.\nLeonel looked up and toward the rest. Though some of the faces weren't from the Royal Blue football team, he smiled toward them nonetheless. For a moment, everyone seemed to forget that they were on a battlefield. Whatever pressure had been coming from the Invalids all around them, or the white wolf just 20 or so meters from them had all of a sudden vanished.\n\"Fire!\"\nFinally, the canons had been aimed and were all fired at once.\nLeonel's gaze sharpened. Though this wasn't as bad as what Miles had done before, they were clearly still within the range of being struck. A 20 meter buffer was nothing to such high-tech bombs.\nThe white wolf's gaze didn't seem to want to leave Leonel, but Leonel also seemed to have no intention of paying any mind to the white wolf.\n\"All of you, let's go.\"\n\"Ah…\"\nEveryone was shocked by Leonel's words. What did he mean let's go? Didn't he see that they were in the middle of a battlefield? Also, hadn't a volley of bombs just been launched, maybe in as soon as another second, they would all be dead.\nHowever, Leonel only smiled and winked.\nForce surged around him, lighting up a pattern on the ground that had been invisible to this point.\nThe truth was that Leonel hadn't appeared randomly and out of thin air, nor did he try to appear at the last moment on purpose. He had been trying to find a method of getting everyone out of here in one piece.\nThe reason he appeared abruptly was because before then, he had been using [Light Refraction] to appear invisible. In the time, he managed to draw a teleportation Art on the ground that he was now currently activating.\nThough Leonel wasn't necessarily afraid of the white wolf Variant Invalid, he knew that he wouldn't have been able to accomplish this while its sights were locked onto him.\nLuckily, Leonel's Soul Force had entered the Fourth Dimension. One had to remember that in order to practice in Force, Internal Sight was needed. Without it, sensing and controlling Force was impossible. By this logic, the stronger one's Internal Sight, the greater control of Force one had.\nWith Leonel's level of control, he was able to draw such a large array without the horde of Invalids around him even sensing any leakage.\nJust as the bombs fell, Leonel's teleportation Art activated, taking him and everyone else along.\nBANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!\nThe white wolf who had been observing Leonel all this time was slightly caught off guard. It wasn't that it didn't expect such a bombardment to happen, but rather that it had stopped paying attention to anything but Leonel.\nOn the walls, Miles sighed a breath of relief. His greatest worry was that with the white wolf's speed, they wouldn't be able to hit it in the first place. Now, he could put his heart at rest.\nOf course… Miles had no idea that the only reason he ever hit the white wolf in the first place was because of the man he hated most in the world.\nHowever, Miles wouldn't have time to think about this at all, because as the smoke slowly cleared, a familiar billowing coat of white fur appeared. Not only was it pristine, it was just as spotless as it had been before the bombardment.\nThe white wolf took its attention away from the sudden disappearance of the object of its interest, its pearly blue eyes turning somewhat demonic.\nA low growl slowly overtook the waning sounds of artillery, the ground cracking once again as the white wolf's limbs flexed.\nBANG!\nA familiar shadow appeared in the skies.. But this time… it was above the walls of Royal Blue Fort.",

      "content": "The soldiers manning the Fort walls were completely caught off guard. None of them seemed to have proper measures to react. Before anyone could even begin thinking of counters, the white wolf had already landed atop the walls.\nA strong paw swept across, taking a troops of over dozen out in a single attack.\nBlood and screams of agony rained. Some fell from the walls, but even those who were lucky enough to land upon it felt as though every bone in their bodies had been broken.\nJust like that, the proudest feature of the Fort was conquered. What was such protection worth if took just a single leap to circumvent?\n\"Give me a damned gun.\" Miles barked, snatching the Commander's rifle.\nMiles' gaze shone with a vicious light. The situation seemed bad, but it also represented an opportunity. This stupid beast didn't realize that the moment it jumped to the walls of the Fort, it had entered the range of the Force Disruption Towers they had already set up.\nThis ultimately meant that not only was it mostly restricted to only using its physical strength, but it also meant that true 25th century technology could be rolled out.\n\"Execute Plan B! Bring out the weapons!\"\nThe Commander regained his bearing beneath Miles' orders. Though he was a military official, the truth was that due to Royal Blue Province's special locale, most of its military personnel were admirals. Their experience with ground combat was limited.\nHowever, as an Heir to a Governor Duke family, Miles had been trained in all sorts of matters since his youth. Regardless of the situation, he would be ready.\nBeneath Miles' orders, everyone quickly regrouped.\nDown below, the army of Invalids, led by the 12 ice guards, began to launch an assault against the Fort walls. But, Miles focused on the situation at hand.\nAt the rate they were going, it would take them several hours to breech the walls. But, the white wolf Invalid was an immediate problem.\nMiles knew that his ability was useless against the white wolf. Plus, beneath the influence of Force Disruption Towers, his ability was also far more difficult to deploy. Since that was the case, he would rely on modern technology.\nThis was the advantage Earth had in comparison to other worlds. The number of geniuses born to this world allowed them to reach a level of strength that should have been impossible for a Third Dimensional world. Even as an infantile planet, they weren't pushovers.\nA tide of black uniformed tactical units surrounded the white wolf from all sides, a rain of bullets falling upon its pristine white coat.\nCompared to the past, the pain the Variant Invalid felt couldn't be considered on the same level. Without the restrictions placed on technology, its tough coat was being continuously pierced.\n\"ROOOOAAARR!!\"\nThe Variant Invalid tried to call upon the elements to strengthen itself once again. But, it found that the amount it could call upon had reduced by more than half.\nIn response, it rumbled a low growl, sweeping out a paw with the strength it did manage to gather.\n\"SHIELD!\"\nA captain roared out.\nThe tactical units moved forward like a well oiled machine.\nHolding out black, hexagonal shields, the kneeled down shoulder to shoulder and slammed them into the ground. A fluctuating electricity soon followed soon, covering the surroundings in a pale blue shield that quaked beneath the strike of the white wolf.\n\"50% depletion!\" A frontline soldier roared.\n\"Swap!\" The captain replied instantaneously. \"Fire!\"\nThe operation seemed seamless. A cycle of defense, offense, and recharging. Shield units swapped out their energy cells. Attack units continuously reloaded. Their various captains handed down orders in a practiced and timely manner.\nIt was clear that these tactical units were far better than the seamen had been.\nThe white fur of the Variant Invalid finally began to be covered in patches of red, its blue eyes flickering with fury.\nIt wanted to jump down the walls and toward the city below, but it found that the restrictions on its ability were even more severe in that direction. At the same time, its pride didn't allow it to retreat.\n…\nLeonel reappeared on the same collapsed building he had been on before. But, this time, there were dozens of new faces around him.\nHowever, none of them spoke.\nThough Leonel had saved them, they all still had family within those walls. Leonel knew he couldn't very well leave things be. Even if his teammates didn't have anyone else to care for, Leonel couldn't very well allow so many innocents to die just because he hated the actions of a few.\nThis Fort represented all the remaining human population of Royal Blue Province. If this Fort fell, it would mean the end of anything that once represented this prosperous place. Leonel couldn't allow that to happen.\nHowever, what Leonel hadn't expected was for the Fort to perform so well\nAfter a while, he realized that he had really overthought things. This was ultimately The Empire they were talking about. The fact the Province was still in this state even after a year wasn't because they were weak, but rather because they had put all their effort toward building the Capital Province back up.\nIn addition, all Variants had been recalled to the Capital as well. If it wasn't for what happened, he and Aina would have been sent to the Capital as well.\nIt could be said that Leonel had yet to meet the true powerhouses of Earth when things are framed in this manner… Not that he would have to fear them, regardless, though.\n'Fine, I'll let them repel this Variant Invalid first, then go to reclaim the interest I'm owed.'\nWhat Leonel didn't know at this point was that these matters wouldn't end so simply. Miles might have been setting up his own plans, but there were other intelligent minds at work as well.\nVariant Invalids weren't so simple as they seemed. But this was only one aspect of the puzzle.. Maybe, just maybe, the Variant Invalid wasn't the main villain of this story.",

      "content": "\"Are you sure you want to do this now, Joseph?\"\nAt that moment, Leonel wasn't the only one observing the situation. It was impossible that he would be.\nTo put matters into perspective, there were only eight other Forts of this kind on the whole of Earth. For it to be continuously assaulted by such a large army of Invalids, it was impossible for not only The Empire to be unaware, but for all the other hidden powers of Earth to be in the dark as well.\nHowever, what was particularly interesting about this crew of observers was the fact that maybe had it not been for Leonel's actions, they wouldn't have been aware of these changes at all, at least not so soon.\nThe reason for this became obvious after remembering just who this Joseph was.\nThis was Joseph Warner, brother to Damian Warner and the very same man who led the first group of the Slayer Legion Leonel ever met.\nMonths ago, the three men – Joseph, Damian and Leonel – had come to an agreement to take down Royal Blue Fort. Such a large task would have come with unimaginable rewards.\nIn order to prepare for this, the two brothers had no choice but to bring Leonel in to get registered. Had they simply left such a large contributor to their mission as an unknown, they could very well be the subject of investigation. Such a thing would have been too suspicious and they could have become marked as traitors.\nOnly by following all the red tape could they benefit from this potential boon. But, they had never expected to meet Hacker Hutch and had been even more caught off guard by the fact Hacker Hutch actually all but kidnapped Leonel.\nIt had already been months since then without a single word from Leonel.\nHowever, in order to be ready, they had continued to monitor the situation of the Fort. They managed to gather information on everything from the patrol units to the tactical units and even to the zone clearing units.\nWhen they learned of the situation between Leonel and the Slayer Legion though, they came to accept the fact that they had wasted their time… Not only had they wasted it, but they had paid a dear price for it.\nBoth brothers had been demoted for their involvement in bringing Leonel to the Slayer Legion. Since their involvement was minimal, they only lost a single rank. However, it was still a devastating loss to them.\nJoseph had been so close to being promoted to a true Commander from Vice Commander, yet now he wasn't even in line for promotion any longer.\nIt was practically an unspoken rule within the Slayer Legion. A demotion was almost always the end of someone's career.\nIronically, this made the fervor the two brothers had for conquering the Fort all the stronger. This would be the only chance they had to truly reclaim any semblance of a career they once had.\nBut, now that an opportunity had really presented itself, Damian began to hesitate.\nJoseph clenched his jaw. \"This is the only option we brothers have left. If we don't, we'll remain as middling captains for the rest of our life.\"\nDamian sighed. \"I heard that they promoted that Sela woman again. To think we originally wanted to use her as a cover for Leonel, now she's riding above our heads.\"\nJoseph's gaze hardened. But, in the end, he didn't say the words he thought.\n\"Gather up catwoman and the others. When this Variant falls, we move.\"\n\"Shouldn't we tell Cap – Commander Sela?\" Damian asked.\nJoseph sneered. \"What are the odds she'll be at headquarters where she's meant to be?\"\nDamian heard these words and didn't say anything more.\nHe was the one who brought Leonel to his brother back then. Though he knew his brother only blamed Leonel, Damian couldn't help but feel one part guilty.\nSeeing Sela sit in a position he felt she didn't deserve ate Joseph's insides with a level of rage and jealousy he had never felt in his life before. Despite the fact she had taken the position that should have been his, she didn't even seem to treasure it. But, how could she?\nWhen they met Sela, she was a fool who couldn't even see through Leonel's talent and instead chose to push him away. The only reason they promoted her was to continue breathing fire to the lie that they were enemies with Leonel and had taken him prisoner. This was all so that it would be easier to catch the Fort off guard with their assault…\nYet, she somehow managed to ride the momentum of that one chance to her current point. How could Joseph not be enraged?\nBut in the end… this all pointed back to one person. Though it couldn't be said that he was at the point of becoming irreconcilable enemies with Leonel, he likely wasn't very far.\n…\nThe situation was quite an interesting one. Leonel had no idea that Joseph and Damian were eyeing the Fort, while the two had no idea that Leonel was already on the scene as well.\nBut… neither group was aware that there was yet another party watching this silently.\nCaptain Sela, or rather, Commander Sela now, observed Joseph and Damian from afar with a smile on her face. But, rather than being on the scene like the two groups, she was using a special treasure in order to do so.\nInterestingly enough, Commander Sela wasn't aware of Leonel's appearance near the Fort either. However, it was unclear if she would react much even if she did know.\nDespite watching the movements of both Damian and Joseph and also being aware of their goals, she made no attempts to stop them. In fact, she didn't even rise from her comfortable seating arrangements.\nShe reclined in a cushy chair, her meaty hands resting over her belly with a content smile on her face.\nAs for what her plans were, maybe only she was truly aware.",

      "content": "\"Cap, who's this?\"\nSeeing that the situation was much better than they originally thought it would be, the guys somewhat relaxed. Now that their faculties were somewhat freer to think of other things, they finally noticed a silent figure sitting on the snowy roof of the collapsed building.\nIt was quite obvious that she was a woman. However, from the glimpses of her face they had seen, they didn't recognize her. Even if they ignored the scars, they didn't remember ever seeing such a woman before.\nCompared to the past, the inflammation of Aina's scars had lessened by a large margin. So, while they still felt that this figure they didn't recognize wasn't very attractive and was quite pitiable, they didn't feel the same deep revulsion the people of Terrain had felt.\nStill, many of them were still inwardly sighing a breath of relief. Did this mean that their Captain had finally moved on from Aina?\nThey had already lost count of how many times they'd tried to convince Leonel to consider other women. For a Five Star Quarterback to finish high school as a virgin… it was a waste of nature's gifts. They had shed no small amount of tears.\nSo, even if this woman wasn't up to the standards they believed their captain deserved, at the very least, she was a step in the right direction.\nUnfortunately…\nLeonel grinned. \"You all don't recognize your own sister-in-law?\"\nMilan's eyes widened along with the other guys.\n\"Aina?\" Milan's face flashed with confusion.\nUnlike Leonel who seemed capable of recognizing Aina regardless of the situation or apparently no matter how she looked, it was clear that the others didn't have this ability at all. The face Aina displayed now was completely unlike the one she had used at Royal Blue Academy.\nAina smiled lightly in greeting before glaring at Leonel.\nSister-in-law? It seemed that this Leonel was getting a bit too courageous. He still hadn't learned his lesson after she spent this time ignoring him?\nHowever, Aina didn't react as violently as she usually did. Maybe she gave Leonel a slight bit of face due to the fact his friends were here. Or… maybe she couldn't help but internally smile when Milan immediately knew who Leonel meant by sister-in-law…\nStill, she took a mental note of this event and continued to play with the little mink and Tolliver.\n\"Oh, right.\"\nLeonel changed the subject and put his hands on Milan and Raj's shoulders. A surge of Light Elemental Force sprung to life as Leonel cast [Grand Heal] on them.\nSince the two were still within the Third Dimension, he had no need to use his improved version of the Art like he had done with Zilar. So, the process ended in just the blink of an eye.\nMilan forgot his shock about Aina and aimed it all toward the changes in his body. All the aching in his ribs suddenly vanished. In fact, he felt better than he had in years.\nAs an offensive lineman, Milan spent his life in perpetual injury. He had long since gotten used to playing through the hurt. This was maybe the first time in a long time that… he was actually completely healthy?\n\"Cap!\" Raj's mouth widened in surprise. \"I thought you awakened a sensory ability? Did you awaken a second ability?\"\nLeonel's teammates looked toward him in shock, especially the rookie, Drake. It was as though they were looking at a god in the flesh.\nThough they had heard a lot about powerful abilities through rumors, they had never once heard of a person awakening more than one ability.\nLeonel chuckled and shook his head.\nThough Earth was quite advanced in many things, when it came to understanding of this new world order, they were still quite lacking. There were many times in the past where others mistook Leonel's Snowy Star Owl Lineage Factor as his ability.\nThis only made sense, though. Earth had yet to begin creating its own magic systems. Even Terrain, which was considered to be near the bottom of the barrel in terms of worlds, had begun to refine their own.\nJilniya's Falls Style was exactly this. Terrain focused heavily on Styles and the boost it could give to their overall combat prowess.\nBut Earth…? It had yet to find itself.\nThinking of this, Leonel looked up into the sky, trying to find their second moon and the location of Camelot. Unfortunately, the heavy snow guaranteed that that sky would be covered in a dense swath of clouds. Even if Camelot was right about him, Leonel wouldn't be able to see it.\nLeoenl couldn't help but wonder how the saga between Earth and Camelot would end. Maybe Camelot would be the trigger Earth needed to begin building its own magic system.\nWith Earth's ingenuity, Leonel had no doubt that they would soon forge a path of their own.\nJust think about it, even with a magic system to speak of, even without Force, Leonel was now watching what was effectively an army of mortals slaughter a Variant Invalid with strength almost comparable to an entity of the Fourth Dimension.\nThat was unimaginable for the vast majority of worlds. In fact, Earth might be the only place capable of achieving such a thing.\nLeonel smiled and shook his head.\n\"With me here, you all don't have anything to worry about. I won't let what happened last time happen again.\"\nLeonel looked back toward his teammates, a stern determination on his face.\nA group of over a dozen men looked back toward him, not an ounce of doubt in their gazes. It seemed that long ago, Leonel had become far more than their quarterback.\nAina peeked back toward this scene, her eyes hiding a swirl of emotion.\nThe sight of Leonel leading a group of men and earning their respect and devotion…\n'… He looks most attractive like this.'\nAina's eyes widened at her own thoughts, a furious blush lighting her features as she looked away. Unfortunately, no one would see this sight.\n\"Cap! That white wolf is done!\" Drake suddenly called out.\nLeonel looked back to see that the rookie was correct. That white wolf was on its last legs.\n'Is this really all a Variant Invalid is capable of?' Leonel couldn't help but frown.\nHe had heard so much about their legend and even more about their intelligence. But, this one fell because it not only lacked strength, but also because its mind was lacking.\nLeonel's pupils suddenly constricted, his head snapping toward a certain direction. What he saw shocked him to no end.\nTanks. Dozens of them. Each fitted with a long barrel that swayed with their every movement.\n\"… The Slayer Legion?\"\nLeonel looked back toward the collapsing white wolf.\n'They want to take advantage of this situation?'\nBut… something felt off.\nSparks flew in Leonel's Dreamscape. But, without enough information, no connections could be made. Let alone realizing what was wrong with this picture, Leonel didn't realize there were sparks forming at all...\n...\n(Author's note below)",

      "content": "Leonel's frown deepened as he watched the Slayer Legion's forces move in.\n'This is likely the best chance they have to take down this Fort. If I was making the decisions and was desperate enough, I might choose to attack now as well.'\nIf Leonel was participating in the operation, he would feel more confident in the success. But, the main problem was that he wasn't and he also didn't trust the Slayer Legion to protect the innocents that might get swept into this situation.\nThe fact that they chose to attack now instead of waiting until the Invalids below dispersed told Leonel one very obvious thing: They wanted to use the Invalids to their advantage.\nIf Leonel was leading this charge, he would wait until both the white wolf was killed and the Invalid army it had been driven away. Only then could he minimize any potential casualties. But, whoever was leading these troops obviously had no intention of doing this.\n'These bastards…'\nLeonel's expression flickered with rage.\n…\nOn the Fort walls, Miles finally let go of a rock that had been weighing heavily on his chest.\n\"Subdue it!\" Miles commanded.\nThe Commander beside Miles looked toward him in shock, but eventually disseminated the orders. This was indeed a good opportunity.\nThe Capital had likely long since begun its research on Invalids. But, whether they had caught a Variant Invalid just yet was unknown. After all, they were rare creatures to begin with. The fact one appeared on Earth just went to show the level of talents that could be born here.\nWhether they traded this Variant in for merit or if they kept it to get a leg up themselves, both were viable options. Most importantly, Miles believed that such an important piece would definitely cause his father to pause in his resoluteness to abandon his first Heir.\n\"Junior Governor Duke! We have enemies approaching!\"\nMiles froze, his heart plummeting once again.\nThey still hadn't dealt with the Invalid army below. The damage to their defenses by now was definitely not negligible. If they had to deal with more armies, there would most definitely be a major problem.\nWas it more Invalids? A beast horde brought over by the explosions? Something worse?\n\"Give me information! I need numbers and an estimate of their strength.\" Miles relayed his orders. But, what he learned left him stunned on the spot.\nThose charging toward them now weren't Invalids or beasts at all, but rather humans. In fact, they seemed to have a prototype of a mobile Force Disruption Tower moving along with them.\nFrom a quick analysis, the technology that this troop of humans was using fell into the 22nd and 23rd centuries. This could either be because this was their technological limitation, or, the more likely theory was that mobile Force Disruption Towers weren't as potent as immobile ones.\nRegardless, the threat they presented was not small, especially now after a battle.\nProcuring military goods after the Metamorphosis was incredibly difficult. Things that were once simply like mining and synthesizing material became large mountains to climb. This didn't even mention the most obvious fact that the population of Earth had been massacred by over 99%. They didn't even have the numbers they needed to sustain mass production and the machines they once used that could cover this weakness had restrictions of their own.\nAfter such a massive battle, the reserves of the Royal Blue Fort had been depleted by over 80%. And, as if that wasn't enough, the remaining 20 or so percent they had left needed to be used to drive the Invalid horde below away.\nAt this point, of the 12 SSS-grade threats, only five of them had been dealt with. The current situation was terrible. They didn't have the means to deal with another threat at this very moment.\n…\nWithin the formation of tanks, Joseph watched on from a cockpit, a deadpan expression coloring his visage. He steeled his heart, his only thoughts being of success. He didn't care what he had to do.\nDamian watched on from the side, conflicting emotions swimming through his chest. But in the end, he too steeled his heart.\nThey knew of the events that happened months ago. This Fort was manned by a tyrant that bombed even his own people. Even if it meant sacrificing a bit more to save the majority, it would be worth it.\nThis Metamorphosis was the opportunity the Slayer Legion needed to finally overturn The Empire. They needed to take this chance.\nUnfortunately, in all their thoughts of glory and patriotism, the two brothers forgot to think of one very important thing: How could they possibly be the only ones who thought of this?\nThe Slayer Legion seemed to be a massive power with immense strength behind it. Even if it couldn't compare to The Empire, not many things could to begin with.\nSo, if what the brothers thought was true… Why would the Slayer Legion leave it up to two demoted brothers to conquer a Fort when the opportunity was presented right before them?\n…\n\"The Slayer Legion?! They actually dare to attack us?!\"\nMiles was thoroughly enraged when he learned of who he was facing.\nTo a noble like him, the Slayer Legion represented nothing but the dregs of society. He really couldn't fathom what reason a person could possibly have to risk their lives to join an organization with no future to speak of.\nThere was no worse feeling than when an ant could pose problems for you. Miles had gone from a young Heir, to a person ostraciszed by his own father, to clawing his way back up little by little, just for an insignificant bug to be blocking his way in the final moments.\nHow could he not be infuriated?\n\"Man the canons!\" Miles roared.\nUnfortunately, the Slayer Legion had moved first. Since they dared to act so brazenly, how could they not have their own plans?\n\"In position?\" Joseph asked without turning to his younger brother.\n\"… Yes.\" Damian spoke with a bit of strain.\n\"Do it.\" Joseph said coldly.\nIf Miles knew about Damian's ability… He would know that Leonel wasn't the only one who could move through the ground.\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nA swarm of Invalids crowding the bottom of the walls suddenly imploded. But, worst of all, a large chunk of the wall's foundation went with it.\nThe steel alloy the walls were made of had been refined with hundreds of years of technology. Blasting through them with 22nd century tech was impossible. However, in their several months of observation, the Slayer Legion realized one thing: In the haste to build this wall as quickly as possible, its foundation was neglected.\nIf strategic points were targeted… it would collapse beneath its own weight… especially if it had already been damaged by a horde of Invalids first.",

      "content": "The detonation was deafening. To those within the walls, it felt as though another doomsday was descending. The cacophonic blasts were no less haunting than the day the Paradise Islands fell from the sky.\nMiles felt the ground beneath his feet buckle and collapse.\nWhat did it sound like for millions of tons of steel to bend? What did it sound like for a mountain of metal to collapse?\nWell, it was uncertain if many could tell you because that day, those noises weren't what stood out at the forefront. What they would instead remember was the sight of the wall that had protected them for over a year splitting and the flood of Invalids that crawled out from the billowing smoke and endless fires.\nIt was a sight right out of hell.\nThese creatures didn't know pain, they didn't know fatigue, they didn't know mercy. Even while climbing over the charred corpses of their own comrades, they didn't pause for even a moment.\nTheir only thoughts were of the humans they could sense. Those were the people lucky enough to succeed where they failed, they were the nutrients they could use to evolve once again and change their futures.\nMiles clung onto anything he could to not fall to the ground below. He pulled himself up, crawling toward where the walls were still level. But, there were no small number of soldiers who weren't nearly as lucky as he had been.\nThe chain of command completely collapsed.\nThe tanks of the Slayer Legion continued to roll forward. Their barrels aimed upward, firing toward the tops of the walls.\nThe chaos was already enough to almost guarantee that no one would be able to target the Fort's canons toward them. However, Joseph left nothing up to chance. Without caring for casualties, the tracks of their tanks crawled through the battlefield, firing in a rhythmic manner.\nWithin the city, chaos had descended. With the intelligence, or lack thereof, of the Invalids, they didn't even seem to realize another party was approaching from the back. They all shot forward, entering the outer limits of the Fort.\nBy now, within the inner city limits, the nobles had become aware of what was happening.\n\"Dad, what should we do?\" James entered his father's office with a panicked expression.\n\"What exactly are you panicking about?\" James' father responded casually.\n\"The city, it's being overrun by Invalids! I'm sure that if even I've heard about it, you also know that the Slayer Legion made its move.\"\n\"…\" James' father placed down the tablet he was reading from. \"And?\"\nJames was stunned.\nHe didn't really understand what was happening. Even if his father didn't care about the commoners, shouldn't he at least care about his own safety? If the city was overrun, they would be finished.\nJames' father shook his head.\n\"Use your head, James. The Royal Blue Fort is one of the only eight on Earth. Even if most of The Empire's strength has been concentrated in the Capital, do you really think the walls of such a Fort should be so easy to take down…?\"\n\"You…\"\nJames was stunned.\nHe suddenly understood. This was meant to be a Fort built by the hands of the foremost experts of the Royal Blue Province. How could it only last a few hours under siege? How could it only survive a single 'well-placed' explosion?\nThis Fort was meant to represent the consolidation of much of Earth's power. How could a ragtag squad of rebels possibly take it down so easily?\nIt was only then that James remembered… the inner city had always been under an illusion cast by the Junior Governor Duke.\nFrom the outside, it seemed like a normal doorway and gate… but was it?\nJames shivered as he grasped the situation. The walls on the outside were always a casual fa?ade. Why would these nobles spend resources on protecting an outer city of peasants when they could pour all their resources into protecting an inner city built for themselves?\nNow that James thought about it, other than Miles, no other nobles went to the wall. In fact, Miles could be considered to be the one with the greatest ability.\n\"… Dad, you're abandoning the Junior Governor Duke?\"\nJames' father sneered. \"Do you think that he's a person we should still follow? Why? So that we can sink along with him?\"\nJames didn't know how to respond.\nHe had lost the greatest friend he had ever had for the sake of pleasing Miles. Now they were abandoning him so easily? For some reason, this made his insides churn even more than that look Leonel had given him that last time they stood face to face…\nHe threw the game for Conrad, but now he was dead. He tried to betray Leonel for Miles, but now he might very well be dead as well. How many more sacrifices would he have to make? How many more of them would be just as meaningless?\n\"You've done good though, James.\" James' father rose from his seat. \"That Miles contacted me about communicating with the Siegfried family. He wanted me to expose that the death of their son was related to the Brazinger family, correct?\"\nJames nodded stiffly. He had reported this to his father the other day and it seemed that Miles contacted him not long later.\n\"You will go to the Siegfried family to represent the Bennett's. When the time comes, reveal to them that the one who did the deed was Leonel Morales.\"\nJames froze.\nHe couldn't understand. What was the purpose of this?\n\"Wh –\"\n\"Don't ask why, just do as I say.\"\nThe sound of the bombardment felt like a low rumbling at their location. But, slowly but surely, the rumbling dampened and eventually, they couldn't hear anything at all. It was as though they had been completely cut off from the outside world.\nJames gripped his fists tightly, looking toward the ground as the voice of his father drifted to his ears once again.\n\"… The title of Governor Duke belongs to our family. Unfortunately, your great grandfather trusted the wrong people... Remember that the sole purpose of your existence is to lead a path toward the rebirth of this family.\n\"Go.\"\n…\nIn the outside world, the rumbling had obviously never stopped. While the inner city had regained a peaceful calmness, the cries of those without status continued to ring.\nBut, it was in that moment that a figure appeared before the crack in the steel wall, his irises flickering between a violet-red and a pale green.",

      "content": "Screams. Blood. Carnage.\nAs many things as Leonel had seen in the past year, he still wasn't ready for this. The genocide modern technology wrought was far beyond his imagination.\nWith his senses, every instance of fear, every tear that was shed, every heart that ceased beating… It was all in his range to feel, see and grasp.\nHowever, the Slayer Legion tanks continued to roll forward, the inner city of the Fort remained unmoved, the Invalids never stopped.\nLeonel had already moved before he could even register his own thoughts. He faintly heard the voices of his teammates screaming for him to come back. What could a single man do against such an army? As powerful as he had become, it most definitely wasn't enough to cover the sky with a single hand. What could he possibly hope to accomplish?\nBut, he moved anyway.\nThat said… He didn't move alone. The little mink, seemingly sensing his agitation, jumped forward, skipping across the air.\nAina stood, her steps pausing for a moment.\n\"You all stay here. You're not strong enough.\"\nHer words were simple and plain. Her gaze carried the same look she had when she took Conrad's life. A cold, silent indifference.\nLeonel's teammates gripped their fists, but they didn't move in the end. They knew that Aina's words were true. If they moved now, they would only get in the way.\nWielding her great sword, Aina launched herself from the side of the collapsed building.\n…\n\"Fire!\" Joseph's cold voice rang in the cockpit, his gaze growing colder and colder.\nEvery command he barked, every shell that fired, every life his actions reaped seemed to make him more and more detached. Eventually, he felt like a bird observing things from the skies, a passerby in history that didn't have anything to do with what was happening before him.\n\"Joseph,\" Damian spoke, huffing and puffing from his previous exertion, \"The gap in the wall will only allow two tanks through at once. Should we pause the charge and make a larger passageway?\"\nJoseph's steely gaze locked onto the path ahead.\nThe steel alloy walls had collapsed on their destroyed foundations. It splintered down at that point, creating a semi-triangular passageway nearby where the gate had been.\nMany Invalids had already recovered and were pouring through that hole. Those that couldn't fit through took advantage of the crumbling imperfections of the wall as grips to climb up and over.\nThe city was slowly becoming completely overrun.\n\"Send two vanguard tanks through and execute Plan B2.\"\nPlan B2.\nIt was too difficult to predict the result of their explosion, there were too many variables despite the fact they had simulated it many times. Plan B2 was to be used when the walls were damaged but the Gates remained functioning.\nThey would send a unit in to open the Gates from the inside. By now, it should be impossible for The Empire's soldiers to still be manning the Gates. And, even if they were, they should have a lot of their own problems to deal with.\nJoseph's orders were relayed quickly.\nAt the vanguard, a tank with catwoman rolled forward. They trampled over Invalids with impunity. It seemed that any Invalid below the A-grade wasn't even able to dodge their advances while those above that threat level couldn't even hope to damage them. Maybe only an SSS-grade threat would even be able to think about slowing them down.\nThese tanks were Joseph's trump cards. All the resources he earned over the years were poured into them, forming a squad of 20 he deemed unstoppable.\nCatwoman was dressed in her full leather suit as usual. Hearing Joseph's orders, she was already prepared to move out. With her ability and pre-Metamorphosis expertise, she was definitely the most suited to this task.\n\"No worries Commander, those Gates will be opened within 15 minutes!\"\nCatwoman didn't care about military law. In her eyes, Joseph deserved to be Commander so she called him as such.\n\"Forward!\"\nWhat none of the Slayer Legion could have imagined was that someone would actually stand forward to stop them at this time. But, what they couldn't understand all the more was that it was just a single young man.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nHe stood before a horde of charging Invalids and a fleet of rolling tanks, his expression furious.\nEven amidst the billowing smoke, the rising flames and the rushing blood, he stood out like a blinding light in the darkness.\n\"STOP!\"\nThe roar of a single person shouldn't have been so resounding. Yet, even beyond the sealed defenses of the inner city, it resonated, shaking the earth, the walls and the skies.\nSeveral C and B-grade Invalids collapsed before the young man's rage, their minds shattering beneath his might.\nHe brandished a black spear, his irises flickering back and forth between a violet-red and a pale green.\nEveryone heard that young man's voice. It traveled over several miles, reaching the ears of even those it shouldn't have. Despite being within the cockpit, even Joseph heard the voice laced with rage and indignance.\nThe young man continued to stand amidst the crack in the wall. Beneath his feet piles of rubble and Invalids corpses lay. Behind him an overrun city trembled. Before him, an army of thousands stood.\nAmidst it all, he looked like an ant trying to stop the momentum of a towering mountain. But, he stood their nonetheless, his fury billowing.\nThe young man brandished his spear, slashing a line before him.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nThe Spear Force cut through the Invalid corpses, through the piles of rubble, through the collapsed steel alloys, piercing through the ground and not stopping for tens of meters.\n\"Cross this line and die.\"\nHis words were undeniable. Like a higher judgement passed down from a god on high, it caused the hearts of all those who heard it to tremble.\nThe flickering of his irises finally settled on a blazing violet-red, his skin suddenly lit with endless bronze runes as a halo appeared above his head.\nHis bronze hair billowed. It was so long and sturdy that it sounded like cracking whips in the wind, slicing apart anything that even remotely came into contact with it.\nWhen the shock of those who heard the voice calmed, it was only then they recognized who it was had spoken.\n\"Leonel!\" Joseph's gaze reddened, his reason leaving with his humanity.",

      "content": "\"Grind him to dust!\" Joseph roared.\nTo anyone who knew why Leonel was here, it was just a simple matter of him protecting the citizens of this Fort. However, how could Joseph and Damian know this? In their eyes, not only was Leonel responsible for their demotions, but he had even returned to The Empire and was standing in their way again.\nUsually when people felt hatred, they would never consider what they might have done wrong. And, in this case, the most exaggerated result was practically guaranteed.\nCatwoman glared at Leonel through the cameras of her tank.\n\"Run him over.\" She said coldly to her driver.\nCatwoman remembered when she first met Leonel. She had had a good impression of the boy. But, the loyalty she had for Joseph was far beyond this.\nFor a person to join the rebel army in a society where there was only one true ruler, it would be no surprise for their background to be lengthy and complex. Catwoman was no different and to her, Joseph was a brother, a father, and the only family she had. Even if Leonel hadn't been the reason Joseph fell from his tall heights, she still wouldn't allow him to block her path.\nLeonel watched coldly as the two vanguard tanks continued to roll forward.\nIn all their fury, they didn't seem to notice that the Invalids had long since stopped pouring into the city. They seemed frozen in space, completely unable to move. Their white, indifferent irises were all locked onto Leonel. Yet, he hadn't spared any of them a single glance.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\n\"Chain Domain.\"\nPCHU!\nThe heads of several Invalids exploded. Illusory chains wrapped around their bodies, severing their limbs and crushing them into bloody pulps.\nOne after another, they disappeared into motes of light, fusing into Leonel's body.\n'Little Tolly.' Leonel called out.\nBlackstar had followed Aina, but Leonel had taken the little Metal Spirit with him. Since they dared to disregard the lives of the common people just for their own goals, Leonel would make them pay a price.\nThe tanks continued to roll forward. Though all Leonel could see were their barrels and their sleek black exteriors, it was as though he was peering into the souls of those within them.\n\"Dream Sculpt.\"\nLeonel stared down the tanks, their every piece reflecting in his mind.\nWithout the complexities of Fourth Dimensional pieces, it took Leonel not even a few seconds to complete it.\nThe moment it completed, Leonel arranged its every piece into a Dreamscape of its own. In two steps, Leonel already grasped the strengths and weaknesses of the tank even better than the engineers that designed it.\n'Metal Synergy…'\nLeonel felt his bloodline tremble with excitement. To this point, the greatest use Leonel had gotten out of his Lineage Factor was the strength of his body. But, if that was all there was to it, it would be called the Metal Body Lineage Factor, not the Metal Synergy Lineage Factor…\nThis bloodline didn't represent a strong body. It represented dominion over the earth!\nScraps of steel alloy that had fallen to Leonel's feet trembled, rising into the air.\nAt that moment, Little Tolly had separated into ten spherical balls, floating before Leonel and resonating with his thoughts.\nAfter entering the Fourth Dimension with his mind, Leonel no longer needed direct contact to control Tolliver. His free hand moved as though he was composing a piece across the air, tapping with a speed and dexterity that was beyond the normal limits of humans.\nIn his right hand, Leonel controlled a Chain Domain. In his left, he controlled a Metal Domain.\nWhen he said he would kill anyone who crossed the line he drew… He was serious.\nLittle Tolly responded to Leonel's commands. One of its ten spherical bodies shot forward, enveloping a rising piece of steel alloy.\nIn the blink of an eye, Tolliver had finished. From a single piece of steel alloy, dozens of foot-long needles appeared. Their ends were so sharp that even the small rays of sun that rebounded off it were sliced apart.\nThe rumbling of the tanks grew ever closer.\nFrom within the cockpit, Catwoman glanced at the line Leonel drew with a sneer. Her command still stood. Leonel's words and actions hadn't changed a thing.\nRoll him over.\nLeonel's gaze sharpened the moment the barrel of the first tank crossed it. He didn't wait for its tracks to do so. He didn't wait for the entire tank to cross over either.\nSince they couldn't show mercy to those weaker than them, he wouldn't show them any mercy at all. Since they felt that they could do as they pleased because they were more powerful, he would show them what it truly meant to be powerful.\nLeonel's surroundings suddenly felt a rise in temperature. At first it was subtle, but it grew unbearable very quickly.\nThe Invalids that had managed to survive the constriction of Leonel's Chain Domain imploded into a rain of fire and ash.\nThe Fire Element gathered around him at inconceivable speeds. In one moment, the foot-long steel needles were an ash gray that matched the tall Fort walls. But in the next, they had suddenly begun to glow red.\n'Die.' Leonel thought coldly.\nLeonel's halo glowed. As though receiving a command from its King, the metal needles shot forward at inconceivable speeds.\nFrom the vantage point of Catwoman, she couldn't even see them. The speed was simply too much for the cameras to pick up.\nEven to the last moment, she wasn't aware of just what was about to happen to her. The last emotion on her face was a frozen sneer as she suddenly heard the blaring warning sirens of the tank.\nShe looked back toward the camera and toward Leonel's indifferent expression. That look was seared into her mind as her final memory.\nShe remembered that look. It was the same cold expression she had as they blew up the Fort's foundation. It was the same cold expression she had as she watched the Invalids swarm the outer city. It was the same cold expression she had as she heard their innocent screams and watched their guiltless blood flow.\nBANG! BANG!\nThe two tanks imploded into a rain of metal, fire and ash. In one moment, they were barrelling toward Leonel, and in the next, they exploded from within.\nLeonel felt the heat of the explosion blast against him, kicking his hair up in a storm of its tumult. But, he continued to stand there indifferently.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nOne hand brandished a black spear. The other's fingers danced across the air like a composure that plucked the strings of the battlefield.\nHis hair billowed in the air, ten spheres of silver and dozens of foot-long needles hovering before him.\nHe was just a single man blocking a flood from all sides, but he still stood tall.",

      "content": "Leonel was like a blazing sun. It felt and even looked as though he was the central star of a world. Even the splintered steel walls around him began to turn a fierce shade of red, causing those Invalids who still tried to climb it in his presence suffer a fate worse than death.\nThis was none other than the manifestation of the female fire mage's domain. However, Leonel had come to understand that this couldn't be considered to be a true domain. The difference between it and his Chain Domain was subtle, but it was there.\nFrom his communication with the dictionary, Leonel learned that this went by many different names. Some worlds called it a 'Style', others called it 'Martial Arts', some called it a Dogma or a Dao…\nUltimately, this was the final branch of what Leonel had categorized as this new world order's power system.\nWhile there were many different magic systems with countless branches in between them, Leonel had ultimately broken down the over arching power system of the Dimensional Verse into just a few categories.\nThe first was one's ability. This existed outside of everything else and could often be considered to be a unique talent. In many cases, one's ability provided one with an affinity, but there were some cases where it didn't have to either. It was a special category that could often make or break one's level of talent.\nThe second category were Lineage Factors. This could be passed down to one from their parents or be a product of the future influencing the past.\nThe third category was Force. This category included neutral Force and Force Strengthening Deviations. There were countless methods of utilizing Force whether that be in hand to hand combat or even in Mage Arts.\nThe fourth category were Universal Cycles. This branch of the power system used the Universal Force to give an overall boost to one's fighting ability.\nThe fifth category was Soul Force or the mind while the sixth category was the strengthening of one's body, both of which Leonel had dabbled in.\nFrom Leonel's current understanding, this 'Style' or 'Martial Arts' or 'Dogma' could be considered the seventh and final category.\nThis was a comprehension that could fuse one's power systems into one, boosting it and helping one execute it all to the greatest possible extent.\nFor example, Jilniya's 'Falls Style' was one that emphasized a relentless attack. When this Style was mastered, Jilniya was able to tailor her battle sense toward this particular Style, allowing her attack, defense and movement to display themselves as one seamless whole.\nIf the first six categories were branches, this seventh category could be considered one's foundation, the very roots that held it all together.\nThere were a countless variety of Styles.\nThe winged swordman's Style was one that emphasized the fluidity of motion, the fusion of one's steps with one's attack and retreat. It placed particular importance on speed, swiftness, flexibility and agility.\nThe bowwoman's Style was very similar to what Camelot knew as the General Star. For ease, Leonel referred to it as the General Style.\nIt was calculating and considered every point in battle as a piece of the whole. Every step, every breath, and every thought one had was meant to bring one closer to victory. This Style had no wasted energy and maximized efficiency.\nThe final Style, the Style of the female fire mage, was one that brought one to the extremes of heat. This person embodied flames to such a great extent that all the Fire Elements in the surroundings couldn't help but surround them.\nIn this way, it functioned more like the spell [Light Domain] rather than a true Domain. However, much like the Falls Style caused the sound of crashing waters to fill the surroundings, the Flame Style preyed on a sense as well, except this time, it was of one's touch rather than one's hearing.\nThe variations between Styles was endless and all encompassing. But, one thing that was true is that regardless of the Style, only a single one could be used at a given time unless they were fused together into a new comprehension.\nThis made sense. After all, how could one follow multiple Dogmas at once? One couldn't possibly have the Style of an office worker and an athlete at the same time, right?\nAt least that was the case for those who couldn't split their minds…\nStill, despite the fact Leonel could break this rule, he didn't feel a need to. It drew too much on his Dream Force to do so. Plus, for such a situation… he didn't need to.\nHe continued to stand at the broken entrance of the Fort, his battle intent blazing. He had not a single intention of letting anyone through.\nJoseph's gaze went blank.\nHe stared without words at his screen, watching as the two tanks fell into an explosion of fire and shrapnel. His heart felt as though it was being torn out of his chest.\n\"CAT!\"\nJoseph's devastated roar resounded through the cockpit.\nThe eyes of several of the drivers went red. Their canons aimed toward Leonel, their fury reaching untold heights.\nThey were all a family. Many of them came together when they were at a vulnerable place and had learned to lean on one another.\nCat wasn't just a woman, wasn't just a colleague, she was their sister. The same way Joseph was a father to her in many ways, she was a mother to others.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nLeonel's gaze remained blazing. He brandished his spear, drawing another line across the ground.\nThis one was even further ahead and was even deeper. He didn't speak this time because there was no need to. His meaning couldn't have been clearer. If they dared to come any closer, he would only kill more!\nJoseph saw red. To his side, tears streaked down Damian's face. Though he didn't say a word and had clenched his jaw shut tight, the fury in his heart was no less than the others.\n\"FIRE!\"\nLeonel's gaze flashed with a cold light.",

And, even if by some miracle he did, he doubted that he would still be in position to fight.\nHowever, he didn't intend to allow such a thing to happen.\nHis mind was on a completely different level. He could see everything before it happened.\nJoseph's order to fire. The spinning gears as the final tweaks were made to their aim. The slight scent of gun powder. The touch of heat that graced the barrels.\nLeonel felt it all as if he was right there in the cockpit with them all. Which tanks were firing, where they were in relation to him, exactly when their shells would exit the nozzles… He saw through it all.\nAnd that, exactly that… would be their downfall.\nLeonel's raised hand trembled slightly. It was only the slightest flick, yet seven foot-long needles shot forward at impossible speeds.\nThey tore through the air, leaving a streak of smoke in their wake. Then…\nThe sound barrier shattered.\nIn one blink the needles were floating by Leonel's side. In a second blink they had appeared before the nozzles of the seven firing tanks. In a third…\nBANG! BANG! BANG!\nJoseph's heart trembled.\n\"No… No…\"\nIt was almost as though he knew exactly what would happen the moment Leonel's fingers moved.\nThe shells never got a chance to exit their barrels. The timing of Leonel's attack was so perfect that the needles met the projectiles within their nozzles. And the result… was even more devastating than the first time.\nJoseph slumped into his chair, staring at his monitor with a pale expression.\nThere was nothing he could even do. Despite the fact he had a high rank, he only had a healing ability. Even if he wanted to fight it out with Leonel to the death… was that even possible?\nAt that moment, a mournful cry came from Joseph's side. Before he could even react, his younger brother had exploded through the roof doors of their tank.\nDamian saw nothing but red. The ground beneath him reacted just as violently, becoming a massive wave that shot him into the skies.\nHe didn't have time to think of logic. He didn't have time to realize that his actions were futile.\nIn the past, before even completing his Force Nodes, Leonel had already defeated him. Back then, Leonel was nowhere near the monster he was now. How could there even be a contest between them?\nOf course, Damian still felt that these matters were different from what they had once been in the past. His ability had improved and his ability to use it had likewise improved.\nBut… Could his improvement match with Leonel's?\nThe ground rose like a tsunami, trying to envelop Leonel completely. And, at the very least, its shadow succeeded in doing so.\nThe sun was completely blotted out. All Leonel saw was a wave of earth and the man who stood atop of it, completely enraged.\nUnfortunately for Damian… He used his flow ability on earth.\nLeonel spread out his hands, facing his palm toward Damian.\n\"[Earthen Shackle].\"\nDamian suddenly jolted to a stop. The earth he had always been able to control at a whim suddenly became like a steel behemoth unwilling to heed his calls for help.\nHis body was almost thrown off due to his forward momentum, but that was when he suddenly found his ankles and wrists had been caught, shackled down without even a chance to escape.\nDamian's attempts came to a grinding halt before he could even get close. Though he was the one in the air now, shackled by earth that had once been under his control, he still felt as though it was Leonel who was looking down on him.\nThe world fell into an odd silence for a moment. The screams and blood had come to a stop within the city, the rumbling tanks never even made it to the gates and even the Invalids that had approached close enough to do anything had been slaughtered by Leonel just as quickly.\nAt that moment, Miles had managed to crawl his way back up to an undamaged section of the wall. Heavy breaths heaved his chest as he sat slumped to the ground.\nHe had no idea what happened below. The only slight clue he had was Leonel's familiar voice roaring through the city. But, he had yet to confirm if that voice that haunted his nightmares was really the same person who had spoken just now.\nBut at this moment, he simply didn't care. He had managed to survive and that was all that mattered.\nA growl suddenly caught Miles' attention. He looked over to find that he had managed to crawl back up to a section of the wall where the white wolf Variant Invalid had been caged.\nThey had been planning on bringing it down the wall and into the inner city. But, obviously, the Slayer Legion had ruined those plans.\nThe blue-eyed wolf continued to growl at Miles, but it didn't lunge forward. It had learned its lesson about this cage a long time ago. Despite its massive body, this prison treated it no differently from an ordinary house dog.\nMiles looked away from the white wolf and stood. Seeing that it was still imprisoned gave him a sense of confidence. By now, this white wolf had become his greatest trump card.\nWith Miles' intelligence, he could tell that he had been abandoned. He, of course, knew about the greater security of the inner city. After all, he was the one who deployed the illusion that kept it hidden. But, he had never expected to be hung out to dry like this.\nMiles chuckled silently to himself as he stood. Maybe this was the first time he truly understood the world he had been born in.\nThe worst part was that even if he returned alive, he would have to pretend as though he didn't know a thing. He was a man without power, did he even have the right to feel aggrieved?\nFeelings and fairness were commodities reserved for those with strength. Trying to bring balance to a world without power was no different than asking for death.\nMiles took a deep breath and calmed his beating heart, a resoluteness in his gaze. There would come a day where he –\nPCHU!\nMiles looked down, only to find a bloody hole the size of a bowling ball in his chest. His final thoughts couldn't even finish before he collapsed to the ground, his vision swimming.\n\"Shh, shh. It's okay Little White, I can't believe these bastards locked you up either. It's fine, it's fine, don't be mad at me, you know why I had to let you suffer a bit. We'll pay them back a hundredfold soon.\"\nThese were the last words Miles heard before his life faded from the world. Unfortunately, they were spoken in a language he couldn't comprehend.\nAs for his last sight? If one found his soul an questioned it, he would swear that it was a pair of white irises.",

      "content": "Leonel clenched his fists, causing the mountain of earth Damian was chain to, to collapse to the ground.\nHis fingers flicked out once again. This time, however, instead of steel needles being shot out, Little Tolly's spherical forms tore through the air, appearing about the remaining tanks.\nIn the blink of an eye, through Little Tolly, Leonel not only sealed the barrels of the tanks but also the roof doorways. Beyond that, he also sealed a hidden escape hatch. With his understanding of the tanks, how could he miss something like that?\nFrom start to finish, those of the Slayer Legion didn't dare to move. In truth, after Leonel moved again, they thought they would die. But, even after realizing that they would keep their lives, a bout of despair overwhelmed them.\nTo a rebel, being captured by The Empire meant that their lives were all but over.\nEarth only had a single prison located on the ninth ranked province, the Dark Cloud Province. It could be said that though the monitoring bracelets were a huge invasion of privacy, they did their job. The crime rates were exceptionally low.\nBeyond this, the rehabilitation of criminals was also excellent. For those who committed petty crimes or lower level felonies, they received ample help to get their lives back on track.\nHowever… those who were deemed irredeemable were all sent to Dark Cloud Prison.\nThis wasn't a typical story of prison horror. There were no tall tales of torture or terrible living conditions. In fact, The Empire had allowed reporters and activists into this prison many times before. It could be said that for an Empire willing to let 99% of its population die, The Empire was ironically humane in other ways.\nHowever, everyone knew that no one who ever stepped into Dark Cloud Prison ever took a single step out.\nThere were only two greatly protected regions of Earth that were perfectly prepared for the Metamorphosis. One was the Capital… and the second was Dark Cloud Province. Even after the Metamorphosis descended… not a single person managed to escape.\nThose of the Slayer Legion slumped into their chairs. They knew that as of now, their lives were over.\nLeonel lowered his hands, his chest heaving.\nUsing his ability to analyze and scope out the situation had been easy. Commanding Little Tolly's actions had also been easy. But, using his Chain Domain made him feel as though he was squeezing what remained of his life out.\nBefore, Leonel had only used his Chain Domain for a split moment against that mental mage. Plus, back then, his Chain Domain had been incomplete and imperfect.\nNow, however, his Chain Domain was perfect. It took far more out of him to use, especially as violently as he had just done.\nRestraining a target was one thing, but constricting them to death was an entirely separate matter. Unfortunately, since his hands were tied, Leonel had no choice but to use this method.\n'If my Spear Force was in the Fourth Dimension, it wouldn't be nearly as taxing, but…'\nLeonel sighed and shook his head, revolving his Three Stars to recover quickly. He knew he couldn't breakthrough into the Fourth Dimension until he comprehended the Four Seasons Realm. But, in truth, he hadn't even begun to try just yet. He wasn't quite sure how to.\nWhat Leonel didn't know was that there wasn't necessarily a 'how'. Those who comprehended the Four Seasons Realm on their own relied on sudden enlighten and meditation. But, with how Leonel's life never allowed him a moment to rest, whether or not he could succeed in this matter was still unknown.\n'What do I do now…?'\nLeonel felt a sudden headache coming on. He had come here to take the Fort down, he had never expected to be the one to save it…\n'Hm?'\nLeonel's gaze sharpened.\nHe looked to his back, only to be slightly shocked as the illusion around the inner city began to slowly collapse.\nThe truth was that this illusion was never able to hide itself from Leonel's eyes. But now the Dream Force around it was dissipating, making it possible for everyone to see the hidden truth.\nIt was a massive metal dome. It stretched in length and width for at least ten kilometers. As for its height? It completely dwarfed the 20 meter tall or so walls of the outer city. It rose up at least a kilometer in that aspect alone.\nIt could only be described as a behemoth.\nWith the illusion gone, the true size of the city seemed to become obvious. The outer city was just a small ring around the outside compared to the monstrosity that took up the center of all of their lives.\nSeeing such a sight, Leonel felt the rage he thought he had calmed in his chest flare up again.\nWith such a large space, was it really so impossible to allow everyone in? Did they really disdain to do so this much?\nThe worst part about it all was that the alloys used to form this dome couldn't even be breathed in the same breath as those that built the outer wall. It was infinitely close to a Fourth Dimension metal. In fact, this was simply because it was formed of a collection of Third Dimensional metals. In terms of strength alone, if Leonel's analysis was correct, it put many Fourth Dimensional metals to shame.\nYet, the outer wall was only considered to be strong within the Third Dimension. The difference was so striking that one almost couldn't help but laugh.\nLeonel didn't have the time to care why the illusion had faded. He wanted nothing more than to charge over and flatten the dome he saw before him.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nJust when Leonel was about to do something stupid, a little mink pounced in his arms. This small action seemed to snap him back to reality.\nLeonel looked up to find Aina following after the little mink, her great sword seemingly unblemished by battle.\n\"They're clear?\" Leonel asked.\nAina nodded.\nWhile Leonel's job had been to stop any more from leaking in, Aina had teamed up with the little mink to take out any that had managed to make their way into the city.\nLeonel sighed. He really wasn't sure what to do.\nHe shook his head. 'Maybe I should just try to repair this wall first… Can I do it alone, though?'\n'Hm?' Leonel frowned, his gaze focusing back on the little mink.\nWhat were these little faint black balls floating around Little Blackstar?",

      "content": "Leonel put his spear away and raised the little mink in his arms, observing the little guy curiously.\nWhen he focused in on the blobs of black, Leonel realized something astonishing. Each one of them had a different character to them.\nThose with stronger presences were larger while those with weaker ones were smaller. But, it wasn't just this either. Each seemed to have a different feel.\nThe largest of them carried a biting cold to them. There were two of them in total. One seemed to want to completely envelop you in an avalanche while the other was sharp like a thin, cooled knife slicing into your body.\nLeonel felt like he remembered them from somewhere…\n'Those 12 ice guards, two of them reminded me of this feeling!'\nLeonel's eyes widened in realization. These blobs, they were the shadows of the enemies Little Blackstar had killed.\n'Blackstar can't absorb them?' Leonel thought, confused. '… They're disappearing too.'\nLeonel seemed to realize two things immediately after understanding what he was dealing with. The first was that Blackstar didn't seem capable of swallowing these shadows like he had the shadow of Simeon's numbered warrior. And the second was that they were slowly fading. The more powerful of them seemed to linger on for longer, but the weaker ones were already collapsing to the point Leonel could hardly sense them.\n'There are two potential reasons for why Blackstar can't absorb them. It's either that he had an affinity limitation or it's that he can only take in one at a time. If it's the latter, then that means the only way he could take on a new ability is if he gave the one he has already…'\nLeonel frowned, sinking into his own thoughts.\nThe ability Blackstar could mimic now came from one of Simeon's handpicked warriors. From Leonel's comprehension, it was an S-grade ability at worse.\nThat said, the ice guards were SSS-grade Invalids, so their abilities obviously likewise followed suit.\nThe true issue was that the sharpness ability of that numbered warrior was very useful to Leonel. When he and the little mink worked in tandem, Leonel could gain an extension of this ability. This was what had allowed him to threaten Jilniya's life back then. Of course, at the time, Leonel had also relied on many other things like the General Style and his Dreamscape Battle Sense. But, it was still an important factor.\nLeonel curiously reached out a hand toward one of the shadows. He didn't seem to realize that Aina was looking at him from the side with a confused light coloring her eyes. It seemed that only Leonel and Little Blackstar could see these floating shadows.\n'Huh?'\nLeonel shot his hand back, his heart beat quickening.\n\"What's wrong?\" Aina finally couldn't hold back, a slight tinge of worry in her voice.\nThe little mink had charged over here after sensing Leonel's agitation. So, she had already appeared realizing she might have to calm Leonel down from doing something stupid again. But, this was completely out of her expectations.\n\"I…\"\nLeonel took a deep breath and explained things.\n\"… I felt as though something about myself would fundamentally change if I absorbed it into my body.\"\n\"You're saying others can absorb them?\" Aina's expression changed.\nSuch a thing was inconceivable. If this was true, then the value of such an ability would be impossible to calculate.\nAina couldn't help but look toward the little mink with a new light in her eyes.\nThe little mink crawled up from Leonel's hands, up his arm and stood proudly on his shoulder as though showing off. Such a scene pulled out a smile from the depths of Aina's heart.\n\"I don't think it's so simple.\" Leonel said slowly. \"It's hard to explain, but I felt as though absorbing that shadow would take something away from me, almost as though it was taking an average of my shadow and this one to form an all-new shadow.\"\nLeonel's senses were incredibly sensitive. On top of that, his memory was impeccable. He was able to simulate that exact moment again and again in his Dream World.\n'What if…'\nLeonel closed his eyes. With Aina around him, he didn't have to worry about anything else.\nIn his Dream World, a new Dream Clone appeared. But, this time, it wasn't himself but rather a perfect replica of Joel. Everything from his height, to his mannerisms, to his ability were perfectly reflected.\nAfter breaking through, Leonel's simulations within the Third Dimension had a 99% accuracy rating. He could practically reflect the world perfectly in his mind.\nOver ten minutes later, Leonel opened his eyes, his gaze blazing.\nAina, who had been watching over Leonel this whole like looked to him with a half annoyed, half curious look. This really wasn't the place to suddenly be taking a nap.\nBy now, the shadows had all faded away into nothing, but Leonel didn't mind one bit. To him, the information he gleaned from them was far more important than the strength they could provide him.\nThis matter was life changing. He couldn't just casually take action without testing out every parameter he could.\nIn that time, Leonel learned a few things.\nFirst, the limitation on the little mink wasn't affinity related, it was a limitation of quantity. In the little guy's current state, only a single ability could be absorbed by him.\nSecond, anyone could absorb any shadow as long as they had the little mink as a proxy. However, it wouldn't be a simple addition to one's ability. Only the little mink had the benefit of absorbing abilities without consequences, everyone else had to weigh the pros and cons.\nOne had to treat the shadow like one's soul. Randomly absorbing the shadows of others into oneself would be like changing oneself fundamentally.\nIf someone with a strong ability absorbed a weaker ability, that someone's overall strength would become an average of the two. In addition, if the two abilities weren't compatible, it could lead to a disharmony that could cripple a person entirely.\nEven beyond this, there was the matter of oneself. It was very likely that absorbing a shadow could influence one's personality in ways one would never even expect.\nAll of this made Leonel realize that this ability would be useless for him. Where could he find an ability comparable or better to the Quasi Silver monstrosity that was his own? And, even if he did, where would he find one compatible with something as outrageously rare as Dream Force?\nBut Leonel didn't care. He felt that he was talented and powerful enough. He had yet to find his match in that regard, though that was obviously in part due to the fact he had yet to reach higher Dimensional worlds.\nWhat Leonel really cared about were the benefits his teammates might gain from this. If they had more strength to protect themselves, it would be for the best.\nLeonel kept getting this nagging feeling that something big was coming, but he couldn't completely finish connecting all the dots. This left him feeling uneasy… Unfortunately, all he could do was prepare to the best of his ability.\nStill, he had to consider the problem of warped personalities. If the friends he had grown up with all his life suddenly became completely different people… then who had he saved, exactly?\nLeonel sighed and rubbed the little mink's head, its little whiskers twitching.\nAt that moment, the grinding of loud gears caught Leonel's attention.\n'Oh… So they want to open the inner city now?' Leonel's gaze suffused with a cold light.",

      "content": "Leonel watched as the doors gates open. Despite being several kilometers away, due to the size of the dome and his own senses, he might as well have been right in front of it all.\n\"We should go.\" Aina said softly.\nIf they stayed here and were subject to the same technology the Invalid horde had been, they would definitely suffer. There were just two of them, no matter how powerful they were, they still weren't prepared to take down such a behemoth alone, at least not without proper planning.\nSince Leonel had already met his goal of securing the safety of his friends, there was really no need to keep risking themselves here. It was a pointless endeavor.\n\"… I can't leave without killing the Junior Governor Duke.\" Leonel said.\nAina sent a glance over to Leonel.\nShe still remembered that over a year ago, Leonel couldn't even stomach killing a human. But now he was going out of his way to make sure one in particular felt his wrath.\nShe couldn't say that she was opposed to this. This was a realization she always hoped Leonel would come to. But, at the same time, she liked Leonel's innocence and naivete. Though this was a much better mentality for Leonel to have in such a world, she still felt like she was losing something.\n\"… They wouldn't release the illusion over the inner city without reason. He might already be dead.\"\nLeonel's brows raised.\nNow that he thought about it, that was true. Miles had been on the wall when the explosion suddenly went off. The possibility of his death was quite high, especially since his ability wasn't physical.\nLeonel released his Internal Sight. He had been completely focused on the battle with the Slayer Legion originally, so he didn't have the mind to care for other things. Though the battle had seemed simple and easy, had Leonel not been able to calculate every minute detail, it was very possible that he could have been the one that ended up dying.\n'Huh?'\nLeonel's eyes sharpened.\n\"What is it?\" Aina asked.\n\"… He really is dead.\"\nAina nodded. \"Let's go, then. There's nothing else to do here.\"\n\"It's… not that simple. Someone killed him.\"\n\"One of the Invalids?\"\n\"I can't be sure. Normally an Invalid would want a human's Ethereal Glabella, but his skull is intact. There's only a hole through his chest.\"\n\"Then isn't it obvious?\" Aina asked. \"They closed the inner city without sending someone to save him. Someone plotted against him for whatever reason, it might have something to do with his choice to bomb the Fort back then.\"\n\"Maybe…\" Leonel's eyes narrowed.\nAt the moment, his senses locked onto an open cage. He remembered that this was the same cage that held the white wolf Variant Invalid before. But, this cage only had damage from the outside.\nSomeone released that beast?\nSparks continued to fly within Leonel's Dreamscape, but he still didn't have enough information. He had no idea what was happening.\n\"Young Miss!\"\nA sudden voice cut off Leonel's thoughts.\nAina's expression changed. Suddenly, Leonel found his hand being pulled by something soft as he was dragged away.\nHe looked back over his shoulder to see Yuri hiking up her dress and chasing after them.\n'This feels… oddly familiar…'\nLeonel's train of thought was interrupted as he laughed.\nThis was the second time he and Aina had run away from Yuri. He didn't know why Aina wanted to avoid her so much, but he had to say he didn't mind holding onto such a soft hand.\nLeonel couldn't be certain if Aina's scars only impacted her face, but what he was sure of was the fact her hands were perfect and without flaw.\n'Is it creepy to be attracted to a slender hand?' Leonel thought to himself.\n\"Young Miss! Stop running!\"\nUnfortunately for Yuri, compared to the past, Leonel and Aina were even faster.\nEventually, she could only stop running as they disappeared into the distance. In the place of the running couple, Leonel's teammates suddenly appeared once again amid dim flashing lights, hints of confusion on their faces due to the unexpected teleportation.\nMiles looked toward Joel and Raj, then all three met gazes with Yuri. They all had the same abandoned look in their eye.\n\"First time?\" Yuri's chest heaved as she tried to catch her breath, a hint of sympathy in her voice.\nThe three nodded like wounded children.\nYuri rose to her tippy toes and patted their shoulders.\n\"You get used to it.\"\n**\nWhile the Royal Blue Fort had been attacked by an unknown entity, the capital was coming up with ways to deal with the addition of a second moon.\nUnder this second moon's influence, it had been difficult for Earth to get a moment of peace. But, as though this wasn't bad enough, their world's evolution had been accelerated, causing an epidemic of Force Surges to erupt.\nThe activity of beasts and Invalids alike grew as a result, making the environment far more volatile. Instances of beast and Invalid hordes were taking the infantile world by storm.\nIt was amidst these challenges that news of this second moon was finally disseminated and reached the ears of the most powerful men and women of Earth.\nThe appearance of a Kingdom within the territory of the Ascension Empire? It was unacceptable.\nThe instant these matters were learned about, The Empire sounded the war drums. For the first time in centuries, a true threat had appeared within their territory.\nFor the vast majority of Earth, even getting access to the normal tech they had was impossible. But, in the past year, The Empire hadn't been sitting on its laurels. With the resources it had access to, the Capital had quickly become a place no less prosperous than any other Fourth Dimensional world.\nIn addition, even without access to technology, it was a simple matter for those of the Capital to exchange for treasures that would allow them to travel to this second moon.\nWar drums beat. War flags rose. A patriotic aura thrummed throughout the Capital.\nAs for the chosen leader of this expedition?\nPrince Noah Fawkes.",

      "content": "Aina dragged Leonel along until they were easily over five kilometers away. For the two of them, crossing this distance only took a handful of minutes.\nWhen Aina finally let go of his hand, Leonel couldn't help but laugh. He laughed quite heartily at that.\nWith the snow falling from the skies and abandoned buildings all around them, it felt as though they were in their own world.\nAina pouted slightly. She realized that this was the second time she had run away from Yuri with Leonel like that. She didn't really know why, it was just an instinct. She should have just run away alone, at least then he wouldn't be laughing at her like this.\n\"Why do you always run away from Yuri like that? She's probably been waiting months to see you again and was definitely happy to see you.\"\nLeonel finally found this to be quite odd. The first time he hadn't really thought much about it. But, he hadn't expected it to be a pattern.\n\"Uh…\" Aina hesitated.\n\"It's fine if you don't want to say.\" Leonel waved her off.\nAina didn't really like speaking about her past. He didn't want to press her for information and end up pushing her away further.\n\"No… I mean… Yuri was sent to look after me by my father.\"\nLeonel froze for a moment.\nAina's father? After he heard of her hatred for the Brazinger family, Leonel thought both of Aina's parents had died. But, now that he thought about it, Aina's exact words back then had been…\n~\"… The short of it is that I don't have a family. I had a mother, and my father… is no longer with me.\"~\nAina had made it clear that her mother was dead, but it seemed that even she wasn't quite sure of the current status of her father. Maybe Yuri being sent to her was also a surprise on her part.\nJust from looking into Aina's eyes, Leonel could see a swirl of emotion. Hesitancy, sadness, resilience… resentment…\nEven without Aina explaining anything more, Leonel could extrapolate quite a lot. It was likely that Aina believed her father had been dead too until Yuri suddenly appeared. Then she must have wondered why her father would leave her alone if he had been alive all along.\nLeonel didn't want to read into it too much, but he must have felt quite similarly until Dream Force had allowed him to remember those forgotten memories about his mother…\nTruth be told, Leonel had never thought about what it would be like to meet Aina's parents before. He was a sociable person and wasn't very nervous about the prospect. But, hearing that Aina's father was alive made him frown.\nIn the end, he chose not to judge without understanding the full story. But, if there came a day where he learned that her father didn't have a good reason…\nAina shook her head as though pulling herself out of her own thoughts.\n\"It's not a big deal, it isn't as though I hate her or anything…\" After saying this, Aina fell silent once again.\nLeonel smiled. \"Your birthday is soon, right?\"\nAina was stunned by these words. \"You…\"\nLeonel shrugged. \"It's kind of hard to keep up with what the date is with all the changing timelines we've been traveling through, but I think I have a pretty accurate grasp of it. My birthday wasn't long ago, so I know yours is soon.\"\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nLeonel wasn't certain if the little mink understood what he was saying or not, but it excitedly hopped up and down. It seemed to at least understand that a birthday was a nice thing.\nNow that Leonel thought about it, his last two birthdays had been quite depressing. One was spent within the Mayan Tomb and the next was spent training in Brave City.\nUsually, during that time of year his father would give him a gift. Funny enough, usually that gift ended up being more of a present for his dad than himself. Most of the time it was some vintage DVD with some anime from hundreds of years ago.\nThinking of this, Leonel couldn't help but smile and shake his head.\n\"What do you want to do for your birthday?\"\nAina seemed stunned by the question. Celebrate a birthday? Now? Was he crazy?\nIn the end, without an answer to give, she ended up glaring at Leonel. Why was he always so immature?\nEven seeing this, Leonel's smile didn't fade.\n\"Fine, since you don't have an answer, I'll surprise you.\"\n\"You…\"\nLooking at Leonel's grin, it seemed like he had no intention of listening to her words. In fact, her glare, which was usually quite effective, seemed to have hit a brick wall this time.\n\"Huh…?\"\nLeonel wanted to tease Aina some more, but his gaze locked onto a bird in the sky. The beast quickly descended, approaching the pair with a blazing speed.\nLeonel almost attacked it initially, but after a while, he became fairly certain that it had no ill intentions.\n'This message method… Camelot?'\nLeonel couldn't be 100% certain, but this mode of communication shouldn't exist on Earth. But, regardless of where the message itself came from, Leonel had no idea who would be contacting him at all.\nThe bird descended, landing in Leonel's palm.\n\"Hello handsome little boy. I placed a small tracking spell on your necklace treasure, I hope you don't mind. I know you have a kind heart, so I thought I would reach out to you now. My Demon Empire needs some help, we're currently being attacked by those we assume are your people. I hope you can help us communicate with them. In return, Big Sis has plenty of rewards for you~.\"\nLeonel coughed violently hearing this message, his head slowly turning in Aina's direction. But, all he found were blinking, curious eyes and a light smile.\nLeonel easily recognized that this message was from Mordred, but he couldn't help but lament her timing. Why now? Couldn't she had picked a better moment?\nSmiling an ugly smile, Leonel squeezed out a dry laugh.\n\"I didn't know you had an elder sister.\" Aina said, her smile never fading.\nLeonel had no idea why, but these words felt like a fatal blow.. Legends say one could hear the whimpers of a young man that day beneath the heavily falling snow.",

      "content": "After Leonel was settled in, he became shocked by this sudden change. The Empire was attacking Camelot?\nNo, maybe he wasn't so surprised about this much. This was the way of The Empire, ever since they had taken power, they had never allowed any true threats to their sovereignty to survive. Maybe only the Slayer Legion could accomplish such a feat, but even then, they had only been able to do so by hiding away and tucking their tails for decades on end.\nHowever, compared to the Slayer Legion, Camelot's location was laid bare for all to see. There was no chance to hide or be covert, and maybe even they weren't aware of why they had to do so either.\nAs far as citizens of Camelot were concerned, they were in the same location as they'd always been. As for their rulers, many of them might have an inkling, but only Mordred knew exactly what was happening thanks to the trial grounds she shared with Leonel.\nSo, what Leonel was maybe truly surprised about was the fact Mordred had reached out to him at all. Though it couldn't be said that they were enemies, a few months ago all of Leonel's thoughts were filled with how to kill this woman. It was only after seeing her backstory and sympathizing with her that he couldn't bear to do so any longer.\nLeonel couldn't help but hesitate.\nThe Empire was attacking Camelot… was this really something he should be interfering in? What could he even do?\nHe felt that Mordred overestimated him due to his talent. Let alone the fact that Leonel had yet to meet the other talents of Earth and wasn't exactly certain how he stacked up to them, even if he was far beyond what they could match it simply wouldn't matter.\nNone of them even knew his name. And, by the time he proved he had strength and should be listened to, he'd likely be an enemy of them all. This was The Empire they were talking about, they weren't exactly great listeners.\nOn top of that, Leonel didn't owe Camelot anything. If anything, he had saved them. What reason did he have to protect them?\nIf Leonel placed his bias against The Empire aside and looked at the bigger picture, if the people of Camelot were under the rulership of the Ascension Empire, they'd be much safer…\n'Ha, did I really just think that? How safe were the people of the Fort when the nobles decided to abandon them…?'\nLeonel sighed and shook his head. 'Whatever, it doesn't matter. It wasn't Camelot that asked me for help but the Demon Empire…'\nThat was right, most of the reasons Camelot was such a bad place to live in, in the first place was because of the existence of the Demon Empire. It would be quite ridiculous if he went to save the demons that made their lives a living hell to begin with.\nAina watched from the side, her expression far less playful now. She could almost see the struggle on Leonel's face as he wrestled with whether to do something rational or foolish.\n\"… How do you feel about The Empire?\" Aina suddenly said.\n\"I don't like it.\" Leonel replied absentmindedly.\n\"And why is that?\"\n\"They don't value lives. They treat their citizens like they can be plugged into risk assessment equations and deleted whenever they've overstayed their welcome. They don't keep tabs on the corruption of their nobles, letting them do as they please. They monitor the every movement of their people as though they were cattle rather than human beings --.\"\nLeonel rattled off his thoughts almost like a machine.\nCompared to people who didn't normally understand what they were feeling and why, Leonel's ability practically didn't allow him to do this. His every thought had a very logical reason behind it, at least logical to himself.\nThis was why his feelings for Aina were so incomprehensible. They were the one thing about himself that he truly couldn't explain. And, it was ironically the one thing that he didn't try too hard to explain either.\n\"Isn't the answer simple, then?\" Aina said with a smile. \"Who cares about anything else as long as you're standing in their way?\"\nLeonel snapped out of his rant, his eyes brightening as he shot a glance toward Aina.\n\"You're right.\" Leonel grinned.\nThe bird in Leonel's palm had an amulet around its neck. Leonel didn't need to think much about it to understand what it was.\nOn the amulet, there was a key of some sort. Of course, this key wasn't physical but was rather drawn as an Art. This key represented the location coordinates of a teleportation reception pad.\nIf Leonel used this key as the core of a large scale teleportation array, he would be able to go directly toward where Mordred was.\n'It will take me quite a few hours to finish drawing this array, let's find a secluded place.'\nAina followed after Leonel quietly.\nThough Leonel's reasons for doing this were quite simple and pure, Aina's couldn't be categorized as such. In her mind, the more chaos her world was in, the more battles she would be able to participate in and the faster she would be able to strengthen herself. This was what she cared about the very most.\nPlus… she was absolutely certain that if The Empire was making such big moves, it was impossible for the hidden families to not be involved.\n**\nEarth's second moon, dubbed Camelot, was still the very same mess of torrential rain it had been when Leonel left it. However, this time, it had been splintered in a large scale war the likes of which it had not seen in a very long time.\nAfter scouting out the moon, The Empire concluded that the best target would be the Demon Empire. From their understanding, Camelot's Kingdom had greatly weakened after losing six Knights of the Round Table and two Three Star Magi.\nIn such a vulnerable position, if The Empire swooped in and eliminated the threat that had been plaguing them for centuries… how many would willingly choose to leave the rulership of King Arthur?\nGazing toward the no-man's land of Camelot, a familiar young man with white-gold hair and shimmering emerald eyes stood amidst the heavy rain. However, every drop that approached him rebounded off of a golden barrier, becoming sparkling motes of light as they scattered.\nCompared to when he was in the presence of his grandfather, Noah's demeanor was far more level headed and peaceful. Though he lacked the arrogance one would expect from a prince between his brow, he had a natural air of superiority about him, one ingrained down to his very bones.\n\"The meeting is beginning, Your Highness.\"\nNoah nodded and made his way to an elaborate tent covered in soft, black bear fur.. It too seemed unblemished by the rain.",

      "content": "The tent was massive, reaching 10 meters into the sky and 20 in every other direction. Though it couldn't be considered to be lavishly decorated, everything was neatly arranged and not even the fibers of the beast skin carpets swayed out of proper order.\nThe lights were dim, but warm and a smell of harmonious nature hung in the air.\nIn truth, it seemed more like the abode of a war lord than an Empire's prince. But, it exuded an air of dominance and demanded absolute obedience at the same time.\nNumerous young faces all turned toward Noah at once and rose from their seated positions. Not a single one showed even a hint of disrespect. In fact, some of them looked on with trepidation.\nNoah maintained an even pace as he made his way to the head of the table. It was only after he sat that the others followed suit, a heaviness reigning over the atmosphere.\nThis wasn't the first time Noah had led an expedition. With their talent, many of them had entered Zones and Invalid clearing teams with him in the past. They knew how he operated and how meticulous he was. Stepping out of line wasn't acceptable.\nThis was why the tent had been completely silent before he entered and, even after he did, it remained as such.\nNoah glanced toward the three dimensional map that spread out across the table.\nThis map was actually the representation of top of the line nano technology. Under normal conditions, it would blend into the table and be invisible. However, after observing a target, it would perfectly replicate a scaled version. In fact, if fitted with all the bells and whistles necessary, it could even provide live observation of a target.\nUnfortunately, they had only been able to deploy a small portion of this technology. Unlocking the full scope of its abilities would require deploying Force Disruption Towers all across this second moon. But, that obviously was not possible for now.\nAfter a long while, Noah finally spoke.\n\"What is the report on their strength?\"\n\"According to our scouts, they are infinitely close to a Fourth Dimensional world in strength, Your Highness. The main targets to look out for are those they call the 'Demon Lords', the 'Knight of the Round Table', and the 'Three Star Magi'. Aside from this, the most powerful existences on this moon are characters they know as 'King Arthur', 'Queen Guinevere', 'Lancelot' and 'Mordred'.\"\nThe youths looked toward each other with weird gazes. Did they get dropped into a fairy tale or something?\nThough they had been briefed on the truth behind the appearance of this second moon, it was still too hard for them to accept. How could stories become real? And if stories could become real, where exactly was the blurred line between reality and fiction?\nHowever, considering the identity of the young woman who had spoken, none of them dared to make jokes about it easily. If Noah was the one they feared the most, this young lady was very much a close second.\nShe had a slender little button nose and short cropped hair that made her look quite adorable. That coupled with her short stature of barely 5'4\" and her petite frame made her seem like a treasure everyone wanted to protect…\nThat was until you heard her cold voice and saw those piercing blue eyes. She seemed to bore into your soul with her every action, shocking your system with ice.\nThis young lady was the youngest daughter of the Grand Prime Minister Scarlet family, Jessica Scarlet.\nMuch like Governor Duke was a fusion of the Governor and Duke titles, the Grand Prime Minister was a fusion of the Grand Duke and Prime Minister titles. While there were eight Governor Dukes, The Empire only had two Grand Prime Ministers. And, while the territories of the Governor Dukes were out of the Capital, the Grand Prime Ministers had the most prestigious Province as their stomping grounds.\nJessica was too young to be in line for any hereditary titles and was technically not meant to gain much power from her family as a result, but her own abilities spoke too loudly.\nStill, despite the fact she was more than worthy to fight for the position of Grand Prime Minister in the future, she had practically been a glorified secretary to Noah since she was 13 years old. Even now that she was almost 23, she hadn't deviated from this role at all.\nIn fact, the only difference between her past self and her current self was that she had swapped out her usual gray pantsuit for a flexible leather patched armor. From afar, she looked no different from a female sniper to assassin, even down to the numerous knives strapped across her body.\nDespite her small stature, she had quite a good figure as well. This much was clear even when she wore those gray pantsuits. Not that anyone dared to looked, anyway…\nMaybe Jessica was the only one who could read out names like 'Mordred' and 'King Arthur' without bursting into a fit of laughter. It was clear that she found nothing funny about it. Or maybe she didn't have much of a sense of humor to begin with.\n\"Infinitely close to the Fourth Dimension?\" A young man asked. \"How did they manage to pull this off?\"\nThe other youths nodded. They too were curious about this. From their understanding, this world shouldn't be so strong. After all, it came from an SS-grade Zone.\n\"It's impossible to tell so early on.\" Jessica replied coldly. \"Our best guess is that their Force seems to be several times thicker than the norm. It is likely that they have a technique able to thicken Force beyond the normal limits. This much has also been partially confirmed from other avenues of intelligence.\"\nAfter allowing the youths to murmur amongst each other for a while, Noah finally spoke again.\n\"Our target is the Demon Empire. What are the main pitfalls?\"\n\"The first is their numbers. The second is our ignorance. The last is their terrain advantage.\" Jessica replied efficiently.\n\"Their numbers aren't only made up of Demon Lords, but also large hordes of demonic beasts. They seem to have some methods of controlling these hordes, though not with great accuracy.\n\"Secondly, we are ignorant of much of their methods. They seem to employ a branch of Force Arts for what they call 'magic' or 'Mage Arts'. We are still gathering information on this. I suggest that we send a few ambassadors to their Kingdom and form friendly relations.\n\"Lastly, the terrain. Their so-called Demon Empire's core is located within a mountainous region. It's almost impossible to launch a large-scale attack.\"\nNoah nodded, tapping lightly on the table. His mind spun quickly, his gaze locking on to the mountainous regions Jessica mentioned.\nA suffocating aura exuded from the young Prince. At that moment, many around him could hardly breathe. Seemingly used to such a thing, they could only clench their jaws, waiting for it to pass.\nFinally, the tapping stopped.\n\"Forming diplomatic relations is not a bad idea, but it will take too long. Imperial Grandfather granted us three months at most to complete this mission, we can't afford to waste it.\n\"Since there is no path of attack through the mountains, we will make one. Implement the detonation plan of 2097.\n\"Jessica, you will lead your squad to deal with the demonic beasts. The more you pull into our control, the better. You have two weeks.\n\"Finally, send an ultimatum to this King Arthur.. It's either he helps us to level this Demon Empire, or, after we're done, he'll be next.\"",

      "content": "A sudden flash caught the patrolling guards by surprise.\nThe location was a dark castle hidden within the depths of a mountainous region. It was designed so well that it seemed to blend into the jagged structure of the mountains around it, giving off a dark and sinister vibe.\nIt was safe to say that such a region rarely, if ever, received visitors. And, those who could use this teleportation platform were even rarer.\nHowever, the guards were even more shocked when they realized that their two guests were… humans?\nAny other guards would likely lash out with an attack by now. But, these guards were so used to doing nothing that they were stunned for a moment, not knowing how they should react.\nAt that moment, Leonel's vision cleared and he locked eyes on the two demon guards before him. Both of them were women dressed a bit too… scantily for a normal teenage boy to ignore. Of course, that was only if these teenage boys weren't Leonel Morales.\nThe two guards had pale violet skin and twin horns that came out from their seemingly delicate foreheads. As though that wasn't enough to complete the picture, they both had thin, devilish tails.\nNo matter how one looked at it, these two were a pair of succubi. Leonel couldn't imagine how Mordred thought to receive good quality protection from these two.\nLeonel looked toward Aina and back before clearing his throat.\n\"Hello, I'm Leonel. Mordred asked to see me?\"\nLeonel rarely felt awkward socializing with others, but this was simply too much. Was this how he should be asking to see a Demon Empress that was feared by so many? Why did it sound like he was checking in at a doctor's appointment?\n\"Ah…\" The two demon women looked toward one another, seemingly communicating about whether they should be attacking now or not.\nLuckily, large doors off to the side of the quiet room suddenly opened, revealing the figure of a voluptuous woman with pale skin. It seemed as though the only hint of color on her body were her red lips. As for everything else, they seemed painted in black and white.\nWho else could this person be if not the Demon Empress Mordred?\nMordred smiled, opening her soft lips to speak. But, she suddenly paused when she noticed Aina, her lashes fluttering as she blinked, a curious light in her eye.\nLooking from Aina to Leonel then back, a sudden amused light colored her eyes.\n\"Leonel and Aina, correct?\"\nLeonel was stunned for a moment, then he remembered that Mordred had seen his life from start to end like he had hers. Even though this Aina didn't match up to his memories, with some context clues and an intelligent mind, it wasn't much of a problem to draw the proper conclusion.\nLeonel smiled. \"Demon Empress.\"\nMordred giggled. \"You don't have to call me that, just call me big sis or Em.\"\nLeonel coughed lightly. \"Em it is, then.\"\nMordred only laughed more at this reaction.\n\"Come with me, I'll show you to some accommodations. I might as well act as a proper host.\"\nMordred left with Leonel and Aina under the stunned gazes of the two female demons.\nWas this really their Demon Empress?\n…\n\"Alright, you two can have this room.\"\nAfter travelling through what Leonel could only describe as a dreary and dark castle styled after Earth's Victorian Era, Mordred finally stopped at yet another massive door.\nThis castle had a severe lack of normal sized doors. All the ones they had come across to this point were ten meters tall at the smallest and all had elaborate archways.\nSeeing this door, however, Leonel began coughing again.\n\"… Just one room?\"\nMordred sent Leonel a glance as though she was looking at an idiot. Even if someone was going to say that, shouldn't he have waited for Aina to speak first? Who was the real man in this relationship?\nAina didn't say much as she walked into the room, leaving Mordred staring at Leonel and shaking her head in disappointment.\nLeonel went to scratch his head out of habit, but accidentally interrupted the nap of the little mink. In return, he received a strong swipe that left his hand aching.\nMordred pursed her lips and shook her head.\n\"Big Sis knows a lot about getting women. Stop being a pansy.\"\nLeonel watched as Mordred walked away, completely speechless.\nHow was he a pansy? In fact, he sometimes felt he was a little too bold. How many people would confess so many times?\n'… Maybe that wasn't so much of a good thing.' Leonel coughed silently to himself. If one had followed him for the last day, they'd probably assume he had a cold of some sort.\nLeonel walked into the room after Aina, his head swirling with confusing thoughts. Was he really a pansy?\n\"Have a nice rest!\" Mordred's voice came from the hallway. \"We can talk about the rest tomorrow morning.\"\nLeonel felt the door lightly click behind him. He didn't need to think to know that this was Mordred taking action again.\nThe first thing he saw was a massive bed. It was at least three meters in width and five in length. It was covered with a canopy that partially hid the other details at the same time.\nThe colors of the room were quite warm and much less bland than the rest of the palace. Mostly deep reds, violets and blues. It was quite easy on the eyes.\nA light scent of roses hung in the air. It wasn't too overpowering, but definitely not subtle either.\nAll in all, it felt like a meticulously sculpted room… for a couple.\nAina didn't seem to react much to this. She simply walked to the master bathroom and locked the door behind her, leaving Leonel to his own thoughts.\nBy the time she walked out half an hour later, Leonel was still standing in the same spot, trying to understand.\nAfter a while, he looked up and smiled. \"Need help drying your hair again?\"\nHearing these words, Aina blushed slightly thinking about the last time.. But in the end, she still nodded.",

      "content": "The next morning, Leonel and Aina entered the Demon Empire's war room. Compared to the sweetness of the past day, the atmosphere was much tenser. In fact, even Mordred's playful attitude had completely vanished.\nShe sat upon a chair with a tall back, staring intently at a massive map before her. It detailed everything about Camelot and the Demon Empire even down to the smallest and most inconsequential rivers and hills.\nMordred was so lost in her own thoughts and worry that she didn't even notice the arrival of Leonel and Aina.\nOthers of her Empire might have been more enthusiastic about their odds, but Mordred had personally seen Leonel's memories, she knew exactly what kind of monster she was facing.\nShe never knew that it was possible to wield such power without magic or Internal Strength, but now she could no longer deny the possibility.\nThe #1 Demon Lord Crakos and the other Demon Lords sat around the massive map, all of them equally as silent. Even though they thought they were in a great position to defend, especially when the demon beasts and the mountainous landscape were taken into account. However, they were all influenced by the emotions of their Demon Empress and didn't dare to say much of anything.\nIt was only after the doors clicked closed behind Leonel and Aina did some begin to notice their presence.\nMordred looked up, squeezing out a smile. But, it was clear to all that this was the last thing she wanted to be doing. She knew exactly how dire the situation was, and she also knew that it would be even more dire if others didn't understand the kind of threat they were facing.\nIf even the Demon Lords didn't quite believe her, then what about their subordinates? And the subordinates to their subordinates?\nThe more carefree and careless an army was, the easier it would be for them to collapse. By the time they realized that these things should be taken seriously, it would all already be too late.\nThis was honestly the largest part of the reason Mordred had no choice but to call for Leonel's help. The only one she could think of that might have a way of turning around this mentality was Leonel himself.\nMordred brought Leonel and Aina to sit by her.\n\"Three days ago an envoy of the Ascension Empire came. They established relations and also made it clear that the only course of action was surrender and complete obedience or war.\" Mordred briefly explained.\nLeonel nodded. He wasn't sure what he as a single person could do about this. Honestly, he felt that it might be better for the Demon Empire and Camelot to simply surrender. In his opinion, they didn't stand a chance.\nHowever, he also understood how hard such a truth would be for them to swallow. No one would like the idea of something they built with their own hands being taken away by another just because.\nIn truth, no one was in the wrong. It wasn't Camelot's fault for appearing within Earth's territory, nor was it Earth's fault for wanting their territory to be under the sole control of themselves.\n\"You don't have to do too much during this meeting,\" Mordred continued, \"I only want your opinions on certain things. Though I have a small understanding of the kind of existence the Ascension Empire is, I can't be as certain as you.\"\nNow that she thought about certain things, Mordred began feeling somewhat guilty about calling Leonel here. Was she asking him to betray his people? Or, even worse than that, had she brought a seed of this Empire she wanted to repel into her den?\nThough Mordred thought these things, she trusted her gut feeling. And, most importantly, she trusted what she had seen from Leonel's life. She knew exactly how he felt about The Empire. In fact, he probably hated it even more than she did at this current point.\nLeonel nodded again. So Mordred wanted a consultation of sorts. This was easy enough to accomplish.\nLeonel took a backseat, silently listening to the meeting as they began to debate strategy. But, the more Leonel listened, the more his brow furrowed.\nTheir thinking was too strict, their scopes were too narrow, their understanding of their enemy was far worse than Leonel believed The Empire's understanding of them was.\nThe more he listened, the more Leonel came to realize where Mordred's feelings of unease came from. If things continued like this, let alone repelling The Empire, their Demon Empire would collapse in a matter of a few days. Then, soon after, Camelot would follow.\n\"… I suggest we leave Serpent's Path unguarded. We only have a limited amount of resources and the enemies aren't fools. Who would march an army up that hellscape?\"\n\"It would be a waste of resources, indeed. Other than leaving some scouts there in case of trouble, I think we can leave it be and focus out defenses elsewhere.\"\nJust as the next Demon Lord wanted to chime in, a sudden sigh sounded.\nLeonel stood, placing his palm on the map on the table. His eyes closed as he imprinted it all in an instant. Then, his Force surged, calling forth a strong surge of Earth Elemental energies.\nIn the blink an eye, the landscape bloomed. Under the astonished gazes of all those present, a perfect representation of the map was created, even down to the smallest imperfections of the mountain range they currently sat within.\n\"This is your world.\" Leonel said plainly.\nLeonel's hand waved again, quickly forming another landmass. But, this one hovered above, held there by Leonel's Force.\nBANG!\nLeonel dropped the newly created landmass on the one he had just formed. His actions caused a sigh of pity to spread throughout the room. The three dimensional construct had really been too perfect.\nAfter lamenting it for a while, the Demon Lords looked at the new landscape, their eyes colored with shock. This new structure had such elaborate mountain structures that it put them to shame. Compared to the mountain range of their Demon Empire… it was like an adult versus a newborn.\n\"This is just half a continent on Earth that was once called Asia.\" Leonel continued just as emotionlessly.\nThe pupils of the Demon Lord's constricted. Just half a continent was already larger than their entire world?! Just how big was Leonel's world?!\nLooking at the ease this 'Asia' flattened their lands with, a bit of trepidation crawled into their hearts.\n\"When the Ascension Empire had yet to unite all of Earth, Asia was the final continent that remained standing. This wasn't only because of their intelligence and ingenuity, but most importantly because of their terrain, the centerpiece of which was a country once known as China.\n\"China? is surrounded by sea and islands from one side and completely protected by endless mountains from another. Attacking them was almost impossible and most attempts ended up in failure.\n\"Do you know what the Ascension Empire did?\" Leonel asked coldly.\nThe Demon Lord shivered, their hearts clenching before Leonel's gaze. They lost focus on who was the human and who was the demon for a moment.\nLeonel lifted a finger, causing a small ball of fire to appear. It was only the size of a fingernail, but the heat concentrated on it made all of their hearts beat wildly.\nLeonel flicked his finger toward his construct of ancient Asia.\nBANG!\nA hole was blown through the mountains, flattening them to the ground.\nThe Demon's shuddered. Was this power a civilization should have? How could it be possible to flatten mountains so large?!\nHowever, the next words Leonel spoke made them all freeze. It was as though a reaper had grabbed onto their throats, suffocating them from the depths of their souls.\n\"This happened in 2097, just the 21st century.. It's currently the 25th century. What do you think they can do now?\"",

      "content": "Leonel's words caused an eerie silence to overwhelm the war room.\nMuch like Mordred before, these Demon Lords had never been aware that there could be power outside one's own bodily strength. Even mages who might as well be known as the nukes of the battlefield in their world couldn't even compare.\nBut, to hear that this was not only possible, but had been possible over 300 years ago by the very same society aiming for their lands now caused many of them to pale.\nAt this moment they were no longer the demons that terrorized the lands of Camelot. They looked toward one another, not missing the trepidation in each one of their eyes.\n\"Then… What should we do? How do we beat such an existence?\" The #1 Demon Lord Crakos finally spoke, his deep rumbling voice filling the once silence environment.\nLeonel raised his palm from the table, causing the Earth Elemental Force to disperse.\nAfter a moment of silence, he shook his head causing their hearts to sink.\n\"The Empire is more powerful than you could imagine. If it wasn't for the restrictions the Metamorphosis placed on them, even destroying your entire world wouldn't be an issue.\"\nLeonel's words weren't exaggerated in the slightest. Even back during the start of the 20th century, Earth already had technology capable of wiping out cities. By the end of the 21st, they were able to wipe out whole mountain ranges. Now, as they neared the end of the 25th century, destroying a moon wasn't a matter of if they could, but only if they were willing to pay the price and deal with the aftermath.\n\"I don't want to sell you all a false dream. Though I have a strong dislike for The Empire, I also know that I must be realistic. As much as I would like to paint you a pretty picture, the odds of you winning aren't close to zero, they are zero. In fact, though it might be hard to hear, I wouldn't be surprised if The Empire was using your world as a training field for their youth.\"\nThe atmosphere only grew colder the more Leonel spoke.\n\"If you want my suggestions, in my humble opinion you only have a few option.\n\"The first is to fight back. Inevitably, you will lose. Once that happens, everyone in this room will be sent to Dark Cloud Prison to live out the rest of your lives. Your citizens will be assimilated into The Empire and become people of Earth.\n\"Your second option is to form an alliance with Camelot. Should you do that, you might repel a first wave. But, inevitably, you will lose. Once that happens, everyone in this room will be sent to Dark Cloud Prison to live out the rest of your lives while your citizens are assimilated.\n\"Your third option is to display your usefulness. If you manage to do this, it's very possible that you can gain a hereditary title in exchange for your knowledge. If you use proper hard and soft tactics, you may allow your world to recognized as the tenth Province of Earth.\"\nThe room fell into silence.\nLeonel didn't mince his words in the slightest. He needed them to understand that this was an impossible war to win.\nAina sent a glance toward Leonel's side profile, lost in her thoughts. She wondered just how much of Leonel's words were his own objective analysis and how much of it was the indoctrination he had received since his youth.\nWhere had all of Leonel's knowledge of the strength of The Empire come from? Wasn't it all from his education? Hadn't that education all been provided for, catered, and censored appropriately at the behest of The Empire?\nMaybe even Leonel wasn't sure about this. All he knew was that he was speaking the truth from his own vantage point and that he didn't feel like he was lying.\nBut, when it came down to it, did those that had been manipulated always realize when they had been?\nThe Demon Lords looked toward one another. At the same time, Mordred fell into her own thoughts as well.\nWhat was the reason she built the Demon Empire? Other than the fact she had become a tool for the machinations of Shield Cross Stars, it was because she hated the fact that she was ostracized by even her own parents simply due to her affinity.\nSince they hated her Dark Element so much, she would become the spearhead for people like her and point her blade toward Camelot.\nHowever, from what Mordred understood about Leonel's world, the same stigma against the Dark Element didn't exist. It wasn't an overly religious society, it didn't have a Church to worry about, and the most important case was Leonel who stood right before her.\nLeonel didn't care about the Light or Dark Element one way or another. To him, it was simply something reserved for fairy tales.\nIf she thought about things this way, then what reason did she have to continue protecting this Empire? If a society that accepted her appeared, then maybe she could finally rest her head and place down this burden…\n\"Leonel, do you… believe that demons would be accepted?\" Mordred spoke, her voice slightly weary.\nLeonel looked back toward the Demon Empress, his expression somewhat surprised. He hadn't expected for them to accept this change so quickly. Truthfully, as long as Mordred spoke, the deed was practically half complete.\n\"… I can't be certain of this either. But, what I do know is that there are people all over Earth awakening abilities that make them look no different from you all, all the time.\n\"The Empire, if it was ever good at anything but conquering and control, has always been diligent in assimilating those of all races without discrimination. But, at the same time, this is a new world. It's somewhat easier to accept others of the same species as opposed to a completely new people like the demons.\n\"Still… I ultimately think it's worth a try.\"\nMordred fell into her thoughts for a long time before she finally spoke again.\n\"Will you lead these negotiations, Leonel?\"\nLeonel raised his brows in surprise.. But, in the end, he slowly nodded.",

      "content": "Leonel agreed to Mordred's request, but there were a few things he knew had to be done first.\nThe first was to contact Camelot. It was impossible to accomplish this without putting up a united front. Camelot and the Demon Empire had to come together.\nOf course, Leonel got a lot of pushback about this. But, he had to speak reason to them all.\nThe Empire would never allow civil war within its borders. One way or another, the two would have to assimilate. The question was whether or not they'd act first and get something out of it or if they'd wait to get conquered and receive nothing in return for their grievances.\nWhen Leonel explained it this way, they managed to calm down somewhat and listen to reason.\nIt was only at this point that Leonel realized the demons seemed to hate humans as much as humans hated them.\nWhile humans thought demons were bloodthirsty creatures who shouldn't be allowed to be a part of normal society, demons believed humans to be hypocrites that hid their true nature, only to reveal themselves to be far worse than the demons the hated so much.\nLeonel's second suggestion was to present a shot of strength to The Empire.\nNegotiations were only possible for those with strength. If there was too large of a power imbalance, what would be the point? The one with the stronger fist would simply take what they wanted.\nEven though it was clear that The Empire was by far the strongest between the two parties, they still had to put in some effort to level out the playing field. Only then would they be able to open up negotiations in good faith.\nIn the end, these talks boiled down to one fact… Mordred would have to take a trip back to Camelot.\n**\n\"Hm?\"\nNoah looked up from a map he was seriously observing, his expression colored with surprise.\n\"You said they sent someone? They want to negotiate?\"\nJessica stood before Noah with her usually cold expression, relaying the information she had just received.\n\"Yes. Their #9 Demon Lord made a trip down the mountain to relay this message. According to what he had to say, the Demon Empire was willing to open negotiations and want to understand more about what it would mean to submit.\"\nNoah raised an eyebrow. \"Are they trying to stall for time?\"\n\"They arranged for the negotiation to occur in half a month. I have a hard time believing that they could prepare anything in this time. In addition, half a month was the time frame we set for our first wave attack to begin as well.\"\nNoah nodded.\nHe found all of this to be curious. From the information they had compiled, the Demons were most definitely not such a race. They were incredibly fond of battle and blood, something like surrendering before a single bullet had been fired was baffling.\nCould it be that there was someone leading them? Their Empress should be a human from Noah's understanding, maybe it was her who helped them see reason?\nNoah had never considered negotiations not because he was opposed to it, but rather because there were some cultural barriers that couldn't be crossed with simple words. Instead of convincing Camelot how powerful they were, it was best to just show them. This would make everything much easier.\n\"Interesting…\" Noah mumbled.\nHe fell into his own thoughts, a familiar aura enveloping his surroundings.\nJessica stood silently, her small hands gripping a clipboard.\n\"… We will accept their meeting, but continue the preparations just in case. We also need a proper display of force to set the tone for the negotiations.\n\"I will contact Imperial Grandfather to understand what our bottom line is.\"\nJessica nodded and took Noah's silence as a tacit dismissal.\n**\nMordred never thought there would be a day she would return to Camelot. The heavy rain falling against its tall stone walls seemed to be a reflection of her heart.\nAt the very least, she thought that when she returned, it would be as a conqueror. But the truth was that she never expected to do such a thing. If she wanted to overrun Camelot and destroy it, it was likely that she could have succeeded long ago.\nThe only thing that had kept the humans safe all this time was the disorganization of the demons. Mordred was the very person who fixed this fundamental issue, yet Camelot had still yet to be conquered. What reason could there possibly be for this if not a hidden softness within her heart?\nMordred silently gazed upon Camelot's gates.\nCompared to how things usually were, the massive capital city was quite quiet. Ever since this endless torrential rain began, a dark fog had been hanging over there world as though everyone was waiting for the other shoe to drop. The appearance of The Empire just so happened to be that other foot…\nLeonel watched silently from Mordred's side. To this negotiation, only he, Mordred, Aina and Crakos had come. Even if things went horribly wrong, Leonel was still confident in taking everyone out safely. Now, it was just a matter of Mordred taking that final step forward.\nAfter gathering herself, Mordred took a step forward. But, what she hadn't expected was for a woman in a fluttering blue dress to suddenly appear before the gates. The only one who didn't seem shocked by this was Leonel himself who had long since grasped the energy fluctuations. And, it was even easier to understand after he recognized the woman to be Queen Guinevere.\nMordred never reacted when she saw her father. In fact, even with Leonel's senses, he would have never guessed that King Arthur was her father without having seen Mordred's life from start to end.\nBut, the moment this woman appeared, Mordred froze.\nTears flowed uncontrollably from Guinevere's eyes. Still, as though she was trying to respect Mordred's personal space, she didn't get any closer than a few meters.\nIt seemed that the reason there was no one to receive them was because Guinevere had insisted on doing it herself…\nFor some reason though, Leonel felt as though the energy of this world suddenly shifted when mother and daughter stood face to face. He couldn't quite grasp it, but he felt as though a small shackle had unlocked.\nThis meeting might be far more important than even Leonel knew.\nSparks flew within Leonel's Dreamscape.. But, once again, there wasn't enough information to draw the final conclusion.",

      "content": "Leonel felt a complex swell of emotions when he saw Guinevere. Those eyes… That day when he fell into an illusion of Dream Force, causing his long-forgotten memories to resurface, he had seen them before.\nMordred wasn't sure what to say or do. She wasn't nearly as emotional as Guinevere, but she also wasn't indifferent. She was caught in an odd in-between, a mixture of awkwardness and hesitancy coloring her usually confident, womanly demeanor.\nGuinevere shook her head, seemingly realizing that she had lost control of her emotions. She quickly composed herself, her tears drifting away from her cheeks in a magical sort of way. But, there was nothing she could do about the redness of her eyes. They acted like a constant reminder of the emotions she had just displayed.\n\"Welcome to Camelot, please come with me.\"\nThe Queen bowed lightly, regaining a professional air. However, anyone who knew about diplomatic relations between countries, kingdoms or empires would be wholly aware that something like a monarch bowing to another would never happen. Such a thing would be like a power admitting its inferiority to another.\nIt was clear that Guinevere wasn't a fool who didn't understand these simple and obvious customs. She acted not only out of emotion, but also so that she could let Mordred and the others know that she would stand by them.\nTo Guinevere, in comparison to the Kingdom, her daughter was worth far more. It didn't matter to her that Mordred was already a woman of over 40 years old. To a mother, her daughter would always be her little girl.\nGuinevere rose from her bow, her back straightening to exude the elegance of a Queen. With a light smile, she turned and began to lead them all forward.\nFrom her back view alone, one could sense her strength and resolve.\nMordred blankly stared at her mother's back for a long time. She had expected either cold indifference or a flood of apology. But, she ended up receiving neither. And, somehow, this put her more at peace than anything else ever could.\n\"Empress…\" Crakos' deep voice snapped Mordred out of her stupor.\n\"… Yes.\" Mordred nodded and moved forward, her gait steady and even paced as she followed after her mother.\nLeonel was about to move to follow as well when he suddenly realized that Aina hadn't moved from start to finish.\nAina stood in a daze, her fists clenched. She had come here to battle, she had never expected for things to boil down to a negotiation and she had definitely not expected to run into such a scene.\nHer heart beat uncontrollably. She felt as though she wanted to scream out from the depths of her soul.\nHow much had she wanted to see such a look? Would her mother also look at her like this if she was alive? Or would she run off like her father had?\nHer petite frame began to tremble.\nHer body held so much power in it. Even now, a massive, curved package was attached to her back. Maybe even Leonel would struggle to carry it with such ease. Yet, at this moment, she couldn't seem to control this powerful body of hers at all.\nAina suddenly felt a large hand slip over hers. She looked up to find Leonel smiling toward her.\nHer heart didn't calm down for a long time, but she didn't push Leonel's hand away.\nShe lost herself in the size and warmth of his hand. Though his body might have been almost as tough of a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional metal, his skin still carried the security only a human's could give.\nIt was only several breaths later that Aina caught her breath and pulled her hand away, slight blush on her features.\nLeonel smiled. \"Let's go.\"\nAina almost imperceptibly nodded and followed along.\n…\nFor the second time in his life, Leonel entered Camelot's castle. But, this time he didn't feel the same awe he had the first time. If anything, it all felt somewhat superficial and weak to the current him.\nHe wasn't sure if this was because he had seen through King Arthur's real character now or if it was something else. But, regardless of the reason, the feeling was quite freeing.\nLeonel sent a glance toward Aina who seemed to be looking around curiously. It seemed that despite the fact this was her first time, she didn't seem very affected by it all at all. Toward this, Leonel couldn't help but smile.\nAina always acted so shy, but when it came down to it, she was quite a bold woman. Leonel felt that the dichotomy made her so very interesting.\nThough Aina always blushed profusely when he confessed, whenever they were interacting normally, she didn't seem off put by him at all. In fact, she had always been the only one who seemed to ignore how serious he got when he took tests or exams.\n\"What?\" Aina looked toward Leonel, realizing that he was looking toward her.\nLeonel grinned. \"Nothing, you just look nice.\"\nIn return for his flattery, Leonel received a glare.\n\"Be more serious, we're almost there.\" She said softly.\nLeonel felt a tingling sensation in his back hearing her voice. He swore Aina's various inflections were a lethal weapon. He didn't know if his compliment made her reply softer, but what he did know was that it was foul play.\nSeeing that Leonel was in a daze, Aina tugged on his robes and pulled him forward. The others had long since entered the meeting room.\nLeonel smiled lightly and let Aina pull him along.\nWhen they entered the space, they found a well-furnished royal court.\nThere was a throne at the head and a long narrow walkway that splintered off into several seating arrangements. There were, obviously, reserved seating for Mordred, Leonel and the others. But, what was surprising was that there was another set of reserved seating.\nIn fact, this reserved seating was already filled.\nThe moment Leonel and Aina's gazes swept through the room, their killing intent erupted at the same time.\nThe already silent room was suddenly infused with the rage of two. The familiar red hair and red eyes could never be mistaken.\nIt was a member of the Brazinger family.",

      "content": "When King Arthur saw Leonel walk in, he of course felt a complex swirl of emotions. For better or worse, he felt an even more visceral reaction than when he saw his daughter. But, maybe that made sense. After all, Arthur had clashed with Mordred many times before, it wasn't as though this was the first time he was laying eyes on his daughter in years.\nIn comparison, Leonel was like a beacon that awakened him in many ways. Of course, that was most exacerbated by the death of six of his brothers, but Arthur still felt that the initial catalyst was Leonel himself.\nHowever, what Arthur hadn't expected was for Leonel to suddenly erupt with such killing intent the moment he stepped into the Royal Court.\nAt first, Arthur thought that this rage was aimed toward himself. But, he very quickly realized that from start to finish, Leonel had only swept a cursory glance over him. It was complete disregard, the very same disregard he felt when Leonel strolled out of his Kingdom without even attempting to hide his tracks.\nArthur couldn't help but feel an anger well up in his chest. As much as a person wanted to change, it was too difficult for a person to flip on a dime. It often took years of constant effort to undo what it took years to ingrain in the first place.\nBut, Arthur very quickly realized that this had nothing to do with him.\nAt that moment, a man with blazing red hair and eyes just as crimson frowned, looking up to find the fury Aina and Leonel were looking at him with. But, in truth, he was quite confused. He didn't know who these two kids were at all.\nThis member of the Brazinger family wasn't the only one who had come. By his side, there was a blond and golden eyed man. And, by this person's side there was a green haired and green eyed woman.\nThe last person was another than Leonel would recognize. A blue haired and blue-eyed man by the name of Matteus Adurna. He was the very same man who had led Little Nana and the others into the Camelot Zone. Now it seemed like he was back for whatever reason.\nHowever, Leonel didn't spare him a single glance. His palm had already flipped over, revealing a bow that exuded a deathly sharp aura. He immediately locked onto the red haired man, causing the latter's expression to darken even further.\n\"Leonel!\" Arthur panicked slightly.\nHe didn't understand what Leonel was doing and for what purpose. It was obvious that Leonel had some sort of animosity with this red haired man, but was it really so bad to take such immediate action?\nUnfortunately, Leonel didn't even look in Matteus' direction, leaving him quite stunned. Much like Arthur, he thought that Leonel might have some animosity toward him as well, but the reality was likewise outside of his expectation.\nThe little mink reacted just as violently. Jumping from Aina's arms, it found its spot at the top of Leonel's head, its fur standing on end.\n\"Leonel!\" Arthur roared, standing from his throne.\nEven though Arthur was even somewhat thankful for Leonel, he couldn't allow a diplomat sent by another nation to be killed in his Royal Court. At least, this was how he saw those four. Regardless of what reason Leonel had, he couldn't allow him to act on them.\nLeonel flipped another palm. As though he couldn't hear Arthur at all, he nocked an arrow, his senses locking onto the red-haired man.\nIt was only now that the man began to feel some pressure.\nHe stood from his seat, his heart thrumming. But, this wasn't out of fear. He simply activated his Lineage Factor, feeling his blood course through his body as he raised his strength to its optimal levels.\nHe didn't know why Leonel was targeting him, but he didn't care. He wouldn't allow himself to be killed even if there was a good reason.\n\"Leonel…\"\nCompared to the other voices calling out his name, this was by far the softest. Yet, it was the only voice capable of making Leonel's aura completely disperse.\nLeonel looked over and down toward Aina, only to find her having regained her calm. She stood there, shaking her head.\n\"We came here to help Em, don't ruin things.\"\nLeonel's brow furrowed when he heard this.\nThat was right. If he killed someone here, even if he had a good argument, it would be difficult to persuade Arthur to their side. Even though Guinevere was on their side, if her word was really final, Mordred wouldn't have been ostracized in the first place.\nWith what Leonel knew about King Arthur, he was already unlikely to agree with their proposal to begin with. If he didn't something to push him further away, things would only become more difficult.\nLeonel's arm relaxed slightly, his gaze coldly locking back onto the red haired man as he lowered his bow.\nWithout a word, Leonel put his bow away and made his way to his seat. After taking his eyes off the red haired man, he didn't look his way again as he tried to calm the raging tide that was his blood.\nBut, a heavy aura hung around him. Aside from Aina who seemed unaffected, everyone else was, making it difficult for them to begin discussions.\nA heavy silence hung over Royal Court. Many gazes were on Leonel, trying to figure out the reason for his previous outburst, yet the subject of their observation sat silently staring in no particular direction. However, judging by the look in his eye, it felt as though he could lash out again at any time.\nKing Arthur's face went cold as he sat back down on his throne. It hadn't escaped his notice that his wife hadn't sat by his side and had instead chosen to sit by Mordred. And now, Leonel had completely disregarded him.\nIt felt as though this throne he sat on was weightless. What the hell had he spent his whole life building? Was it really all meaningless?",

      "content": "A silence continued to hang over the Royal Court. For a while, it seemed as though no one would speak at all until it was that King Arthur finally composed himself, regaining his bearing.\n\"Today it seems that two parties have come to negotiate turns with our Camelot, one of which was more of a surprise than the other.\" Arthur began to speak, sweeping a gaze over the hidden families.\nThough the appearance of Mordred and the others was planned, these hidden family members appeared out of nowhere. However, after hearing that they were a power that could oppose The Empire, Arthur became intrigued and allowed them to enter.\nHe couldn't be certain of what Mordred's purpose here was, but as an intelligent man and a ruler with many years of experience, he could make a good guess. Initially, even though he was unwilling, he thought that he might have no choice but to accept Mordred's propositions, especially with the current actions of his wife, but the appearance of this third party left him feeling pleasantly surprised.\nIt seemed that King Arthur was still unwilling to relinquish his power. As much pain and suffering as this Throne had brought him, wouldn't it make all that hardship meaningless if he were to just give it up now?\nMatteus cleared his throat, trying to settle the atmosphere down. He sent a side glance toward the red haired man before he opened his mouth to speak.\n\"Yes. We came here today to encourage Camelot not to fall prey to the intimidation of The Empire. Though we won't deny that they are powerful, what we can say is that they are not the only ones who are so. This universe is very big and its scope is endless. In the grand scheme, The Ascension Empire is just a speck of dust floating in the winds.\"\nKing Arthur and the other court ministers were quite intrigued by these words.\nThis concept of a 'universe' was one they had never heard of before. Yet, it was a word that filled them with awe and thoughts of grandeur. Before, they hadn't even been aware that a world outside their own existed, but now they were learning about so much more.\nAmong these 'ministers' were a few characters Leonel recognized, namely Lancelot and the young prince Lionus. Neither had participated in the Merlin Trials, so they were of course very safe.\nFrom their facial expressions, it was difficult to tell what they were thinking. But, the two sat on complete opposite sides of the room, not interacting with one another.\n\"Your words are quite honey-coated.\" King Arthur said with a laugh. \"But, what does the vastness of this universe have to do with us? If anything, it might be safer to have a sturdy wing? to take cover beneath, don't you think?\"\nEven though King Arthur didn't mean these words, he still spoke them. He wasn't a fool. Negotiation was about leverage and why would he give up his own so easily?\nMatteus smiled lightly at these words. Clearly he was very much expecting them.\n\"To answer your question I think we should give a bit of background on Earth itself. The Empire might be considered the main power beneath the sun, but it is only that. Within the shadows, there are several other rivals to it.\n\"For one, there is the Slayer Legion that The Empire has not been able to weed out all this time. And, with the Descent of the Metamorphosis, the Slayer Legion is only growing more powerful.\n\"However, I would say that the true hidden strength of Earth would be us so-called hidden families. I don't particularly like this term. Rather than saying that we are hiding, it's more accurate to say that there hasn't been anything worth coming out for just yet.\n\"I can swear that if our families were to come out now, this so-called Ascension Empire would have no chance of survival.\"\nMatteus' words were forceful and full of pride. However, King Arthur only shook his head after hearing them.\n\"You've spoken many niceties and painted a picture in very broad strokes. However, you have yet to speak of how these things could help our Camelot. What difference is there in submitting to you versus this Ascension Empire? Though you say you are more powerful, these are just your words. How can we take them just as you've said them?\"\nMatteus smiled.\n\"I will give you proof then. Are you aware of the Dimensions?\"\nKing Arthur frowned. This was a concept that had been foreign to him until the envoy of the Ascension Empire had come. It was only after that he learned about these ranking systems.\nSeeing Arthur's reaction, Matteus' smile deepened.\n\"The Ascension Empire is the ruler of a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional world. Even after Earth breaks through once again, their power will still ultimately be considered to be within the Third Dimension. In fact, the truth is that their strength will diminish by several factors after the Descent of the Fourth Dimension is complete.\"\nKing Arthur and the court ministers frowned. How could that be so?\n\"You all may not believe me, but the true backbone of The Ascension Empire is their technology. However, upon ascending Dimensions, the physics by which their technology is built upon is distorted, changed and flipped. This means that staples of their understanding will be overturned, thus making their technology useless.\n\"In fact, even in this Pseudo Fourth Dimensional world, they are already holding on by a thin thread. They only manage to use some of their prowess with a stopgap measure like their 'Force Disruption Towers', but these towers have no chance of working against true Fourth Dimensional Force.\n\"That being the case, what do you think will happen once the Fourth Dimension descends? They'll essentially be a crippled power having lost their main source of strength.\"\nMatteus' smile only seemed to widen the more he spoke.\n\"And, do you know what the best part about all of this is? Normally, it would take another decade or two for the first stage Metamorphosis to complete. However, due to the appearance of your world, the timeline has been accelerated. By now, there's already less than a year left.\"\nArthur's gaze sharpened, his eyes narrowing. If this was true…\n\"Our proposal is simple.\" Matteus began to hammer in the final nails. \"We will protect you all until the Metamorphosis concludes. Unlike The Empire, we hidden families aren't restricted to Third Dimensional entities and we aren't fools who place our hope in garbage like 'technology'.\n\"Once the Fourth Dimension Descends, that bottleneck that has been keeping you and your warriors and mages from advancing all these years will break. Then, not only will you grow stronger, but The Empire will grow weaker. By then, you'll be on the same playing field as the rest of us.\"\n\"And the catch?\" Arthur asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\"It couldn't be simpler.\" Matteus said slowly. \"All we ask for is an exchange of knowledge. Your world's magic system, we would like to learn it.\"\nArthur and the other ministers fell into silence. These conditions… They were very good.\nMordred clenched her jaw, her gaze icy. She didn't spare a glance toward her father in the slightest. She wasn't surprised by the fact he would make a decision before even hearing her speak. It wasn't as though he had never disregarded her before.\n\"… Are you done now?\"\nA sudden voice cut through the silence.. Unexpectedly, it was the very same Leonel that had been the center of attention previously.",

      "content": "Leonel wasn't particularly angry at Matteus. Other than the time he ordered Little Nana to bind him, an action that almost cost him a spot to enter the Zone, his interactions with the man hadn't been all too bad. In fact, Matteus had even extended an invitation for him to join the Adurna family.\nThe issue here was that Leonel wasn't in a very good mood. And, having to listen to Matteus spin a fanciful tale Arthur and the others just gobbled up left him even angrier.\nCompared to The Empire, Leonel hated the hidden families several times more. Even if it wasn't Aina in particular that had suffered at their hands, he would be disgusted by their actions.\nOstracizing a little girl and her father. Killing that little girl's mother. And for what, exactly?\nEven to this point, Leonel wasn't exactly sure. But, judging by the fact everyone else of the Brazinger had red hair and eyes while Aina did not, someone as intelligent as him could connect the dots.\nIt was Eugenics.\nLeonel had been surprised to see that all these families had the same eye and hair color initially. But, after a while, he came to understand just why this was.\nEugenics was a set of beliefs that ascribed to the idea of maximizing the gene pool quality of a population of people. They did this by massacring those not like them and ensuring marriages between those who could guarantee 'quality' children.\nThere were cases like this in ancient Germany with the Nazis and those with blond hair and blue eyes. There were cases like this from ancient America with White Supremacists. There were cases like this from ancient Africa with…\nThe list seemed endless and each instance was just as heart wrenching as the last. The practice was sickening. Leonel had this sort of visceral reaction he couldn't even control when he thought about it. He couldn't imagine deciding a person's worth by the way that they looked.\nOne might argue that it was more than skin deep for these hidden families. At least, compared to those ancient civilizations with disgusting practices, there was a tangible benefit to maintaining the purity of these families – that being their Lineage Factors.\nHowever, this didn't change Leonel's mind in the slightest. Hadn't Aina still awakened her Lineage Factor? Hadn't his two parents still managed to pass down their own to him?\nAnd, even if they couldn't… so what? The worth of a person had to be measured by their strength? They couldn't have anything else worthy about themselves? They couldn't have anything else to give?\nThe longer Leonel spent in this new world order, the more it disgusted him and the more that budding feeling inside of him seemed to sprout and germinate.\nMatteus frowned upon hearing Leonel's words.\n\"Kid,\" Matteus began, \"Though I'm thankful for the things you've done, this is a matter where I must represent all of our 'hidden' families. Even if you'd like to be angry, keep it within. A lack of maturity won't help you in these negotiations.\"\nMatteus' words caused many to frown in Leonel's direction. His actions were indeed inappropriate considering the circumstances.\nMordred's gaze flashed with a hint of worry before she shook her head and sighed internally. She had already given up on her father, there was no need for Leonel to continue to try to stay within the arbitrary lines of political correctness. Since it wouldn't get them anything regardless, she might as well let Leonel do as he pleased.\nLeonel nodded. \"Painting me as a child who's in over my head is a good strategy. Maybe you could have used some of that intelligence before you were captured by Magus Aliard, or at the very least, you could have used some of your family's so-called great hidden strength.\"\nMatteus froze, a hint of rage flashing within his eyes. He had never done anything too wrongful to this child, he didn't know why he was being so hostile.\nIn fact, originally, the red haired man was supposed to take the forefront and speak. Matteus took over this job to hopefully blunt Leonel's potential aggressiveness. But, what he had never expected was for it all to be meaningless. Leonel acted as though he didn't even recognize him.\nAs expected, the expressions of the court ministers somewhat changed.\nIt was only at that moment that they remembered that it had been Leonel who killed that traitor. In fact, Arthur hadn't recognized Matteus before because he was a puppet under Pope Margrave's control back then, but now that he thought about it, this was indeed that man…\nIn an instant, all the bravado that Matteus had brought forth seemed to crumble. First impressions were everything… if the representation of this Adurna family couldn't even protect his own life without Leonel's interference, then how powerful could they really be?\nMordred's eyes widened. Back then, she had been the one to fight the puppets the Adurna family members had become. She had almost forgotten this completely. Compared to Leonel's overwhelming strength back then, they were… just average.\nOf course, that might have been due to the Margrave's puppeteering taking away their strength. But, the fact that Margrave could enslave them at all spoke volumes.\n\"The situation is very simple.\" Leonel continued with a steady voice. \"Even if everything they said is true, you will still fall before the Fourth Dimension Descends. They're only trying to prey on your ignorance.\n\"The 'hidden' families might have higher Dimensional beings, but none of them can come to help you. Entering a lower Dimensional world from a higher is very difficult. And, even if you manage to accomplish it, you will be forced to deal with all sorts of restrictions. If you aren't a native of the world you descend to, the restrictions are even fiercer.\n\"So, at this very moment, these hidden families can only send out strength on the level of them.\" Leonel swept a glance over the four. \"At least, on any sort of large scale.\n\"Yet, they've said themselves that they don't rely on 'technology', which means that unlike The Empire, they don't have a method of bridging this gap in strength.\n\"But sure… If you want to hand over all your secrets in exchange for protection that won't last more than a week, please have at it.\"\nLeonel's voice plainly concluded before starting up again as though he had forgotten something amusing.\n\"Oh, and a reminder that I already comprehend everything about your magic system, more than even most in this room, actually. So, you should ask yourselves whether you trust someone who wants something out of you more, or if you'll take the word of someone who's only here to help a friend.\"\nLeonel swept a pointed glance over Arthur. His meaning couldn't have been more clear.\nWill you choose 'benefits' again this time? Or will you choose kinship?",

      "content": "Leonel's words hung over the Royal Court. They played like an indifferent, systematic dismantling of everything Matteus had tried to build up. It felt almost impossible, yet every single one of his words were pointed and sculpted perfectly.\nHonestly, it was a far cry from what many of them expected. But, how could they know Leonel's level of understanding when it came to human psychology? In fact, after he finished speaking, he didn't even feel the need to say anything else.\nHe shifted his gaze from King Arthur and fell into silence. It was as though he didn't care about the result at all. He had said his peace and whether or not Arthur wanted his help would be up to him.\nFrom anyone on the outside looking in, it was as though it was King Arthur who had come to Leonel for help rather than the other way around. But, the truth was that in Leonel's mind, it was exactly like this.\nFrom Leonel's analysis, Camelot didn't stand a chance if they didn't follow his plans. If they were more fond of being destroyed and losing any semblance of status they once had, then Arthur could feel free to choose against him.\nAt that moment, Guinevere's hand slipped into Mordred's, catching the latter off guard. The Demon Empress involuntarily trembled and even hesitated as to whether she should pull her hand away.\nIt was just a subtle action. Hardly anyone noticed, in fact. Even in such a silent Royal Court, the movement didn't make a sound.\nStill, there were four individuals this didn't escape.\nThe young prince Lionus. The King of Camelot, Arthur. Leonel himself. And, finally, the Knight of the Round Table, Lancelot.\nLancelot's reflective blue eyes seemed locked onto the hands of the two women. From the outside, there wasn't any change to his expression in the slightest. But in his heart, a wild tsunami of emotions was swirling.\nDespite what some versions of the fairy tales might write, Lancelot had never shared a bed with Guinevere. As for the awkward interactions between he and Lionus, this was only because Lionus had found out how close his mother and Lancelot were getting and felt uncomfortable by the changes.\nLionus held a deep reverence for his father. He hoped to one day be as valiant and have his name resound in the ears of the people just as much as King Arthur did. So, when he stumbled upon his mother having a midnight conversation with Lancelot, his heart, too, was filled with all sorts of complex emotions.\nHe had listened in on their conversation back then for just a few minutes. On the surface, there wasn't anything sinister or immoral about what they spoke about… They conversed about the stars, their day, their hopes for the future…\nIt was an innocent conversation without blemish, one that didn't carry any sense of infidelity in the slightest…\nBut, it was exactly this sort of conversation Lionus had never heard his mother exchange with his father.\nDespite being young then and still young even now, Lionus felt uncomfortable for reasons he couldn't put his finger on. It only made it worse that the reactions his mother and Lancelot had when they stumbled onto his eaves dropping were riddled with guilt.\nThe three of them had a tacit understanding that day that what happened was wrong.\nSince then, Lionus had hardly spoken to his mother and was incredibly awkward around Lancelot. At the same time, though, he never brought this up to his father either…\nThe truth was that he couldn't decide whose side he was on.\nBack then, due to how much he worshipped his father, he felt an irrational hatred for his mother, causing him to pull away from her. But, as he grew up, the image of his perfect father also seemed to crack, but by then, it was already too late to grow closer to his mother.\nSomewhere deep inside, Lionus knew. He knew that his mother and feelings for Lancelot. He knew that Lancelot had feelings for his mother. He knew that both of them knew they were wrong. But, what he didn't know was how he felt about it.\nSeeing his mother grip his sister's hand in this way, he felt like this was a turning point.\nThe relationship between his mother and father had been growing distant for a long time. He often felt like his birth was meant to mend what they had lost after his elder sister was driven away, but he was never quite able to fill that void.\nAnd now they were here.\nKing Arthur's heartbeat erratically.\nChoosing to side with Leonel meant giving up all the power he had ever known. Though Leonel painted a pretty picture, he would have to expel all thoughts of sovereignty he had in his bones.\nIn the future, when he saw those of higher standing than himself, he would have to bow and politely greet them. In the future, when he wanted to direct the movement of his people, he would have to consider the opinions of others and swallow his grievances. In the future, when he swore loyalty to this Ascension Empire, he would have to kneel and lower his head, accepting another man as being his superior.\nJust thinking about these things tore Arthur apart.\nHe was a legend, a young man who rose up despite not having his parents. He was the chosen heir of Merlin. He was the boy who pulled the sword from the stone.\nHow could he kneel to another? How could he swallow his pride? How could they ask this of him?\nArthur's hands trembled, grasping tightly to the arm rests of his throne.\nAt that moment, an audible crack resounded. With a blank look, Arthur looked down to find that his strength had splintered the arm of his throne.\nFor some reason, he couldn't take his eyes off of it. It was like the sound ricocheted throughout his soul.\nArthur closed his eyes and sank back into his seat.\nHe seemed tired, his lustrous blond hair and radiant skin paling by several levels.\n\"… Camelot will side with the Demon Empire.\"",

      "content": "Leonel raised his eyebrows, clearly having not expected Arthur to come to a decision so quickly.\nIn fact, the most surprised were those from the hidden families. They had come here with a lot of confidence and the only reason they hadn't interrupted during the extended silence was to give Arthur some space and respect.\nNegotiations were meant to be like a game of tug of war. A single volley of arguments should have never been enough to close the subject completely. They had expected Arthur to have some back and forth discourse with Leonel first before tracking back to them. Then, they could try to rebuttal some of Leonel's views.\nBut, instead of any of that happening, King Arthur shut it all down from the beginning. In fact, he didn't even pause to have a conversation with his court ministers either. He just directly made the decision before them all.\nIt was no surprise, then, that even the court ministers were shocked. The only one that didn't seem to have a violent reaction was Lancelot.\nHe sighed deeply, closing his eyes. He sank back into his chair.\n\"Hold on a moment, King, isn't this too rash?\" Matteus' expression changed violently as he stood. \"Please reconsider, there are still many matters I've yet to bring to the table.\n\"Though what the child said about us is partially true, it is not completely so. Even without technology, we have access to many mystical means far beyond what mere –\"\nArthur rose a hand, his eyes remaining closed.\n\"That's enough. I've understood most things but my decision remains the same. If you would like to stay as ambassadors to my Kingdom, please feel free to do so – we will accommodate you appropriately.\"\nMatteus' expression froze. Were things really going to end just like that? How had they lost to a kid who barely spoke a few words?\nUnfortunately, Matteus didn't really understand the backstory of it all. There were too many versions of the King Arthur story. He was shocked enough that Mordred was a woman, he would have never guessed that she was also Arthur's daughter.\nThese intricacies were all things that Leonel picked up by being front and center within Camelot. Of course, he also got a bit lucky by being placed within the same trial as Mordred as well. But, regardless, these were all things outside of Matteus' grasp.\nMatteus didn't know what to say or how. Arthur's words were so final that any attempt he made to change them would come off as a sign of hostility.\nAt that moment, Matteus felt a hand grasp onto his shoulder. He turned to find that it was the red haired Brazinger Clan member.\n\"In that case, we will be taking our leave.\"\nArthur nodded lightly and all the energy seemed to drain from him. Under a heavy silence, the four hidden family members walked away under the escort of several guards.\n…\n\"Fuck!\"\nMatteus blasted a fist print into a thick tree. Despite his strength, the tree hardly swayed. But, that didn't stop bark from flying in every which direction.\nThough he had hid it well before, Matteus was completely enraged by Leonel bringing up his capture. He had already suffered ample punishment from the family, but to also be berated in public and looked down upon for it… how could he not be enraged?\nIt was no surprise that anyone part of the hidden families that could be on Earth currently didn't have very high statuses. The only exceptions to these rules were the youths that had yet to mature. In comparison, Matteus and the others were just glorified babysitters.\nIn order to display a stronger front, the older members were sent to negotiate. But, Matteus had never expected to run into Leonel. Had he known, he would have allowed one of the others to speak even if the red haired man of the Brazinger family didn't.\nThe flicker of a lighter caught Matteus' attention. He looked over to see the red haired man lighting up a cigarette.\n\"Those things have been extinct for centuries, Laeron. Keep that cancer smoke away from me.\" Matteus waved his hand, slapping the grey smoke away.\nThe green haired woman and the golden eyed man stood to the side, feeling somewhat impatient. They were more peeved about the wasted trip than Laeron seemed to be and were wondering why they were standing in a forest instead of returning home.\n\"If you all are just going to stand here, I'm going to leave first.\" The woman spoke, pulling out a talisman.\n\"Hold on there, Zindi. What's the hurry?\" Laeron spoke languidly.\nZindi sneered. \"You seem quite relaxed for a man who was almost killed by a brat.\"\nLaeron's gaze flashed with killing intent as he swept it over Zindi.\n\"Almost killed by who?\"\n\"Stop wasting my time, Laeron. Have a good reason for stopping me or I'm leaving right now.\" Zindi replied without fear.\nLaeron continued to coldly glare at Zindi as though he hadn't heard a word she said.\n\"Alright, alright.\" The blond man stepped in. \"That's enough. I'm sure you had a reason for leading us here instead of letting us go home to report this, correct?\"\nThe blond man was known as Ameron. His words seemed to hold quite some weight because instead of continuing to glare at Zindi, Laeron took another long puff and exhaled slowly.\n\"… You guys plan to go back and report a failure? Why? So that you can fall even more out of favor?\"\n\"What are you trying to say, Laeron?\" Ameron's gaze narrowed.\n\"I'm saying that you're giving up too soon, tucking your tails and running just because a fairy tale character told you no?\" Laeron chuckled, taking another big puff.\n\"And what do you want us to do about it exactly?\" Zindi interjected.\nMatteus turned an eye toward Laeron. Clearly, he was interested as well.\n\"Didn't I already give you the answer?\" Laeron smiled slyly. \"Do you get the impression from them that they understand that they're nothing but a bedtime story?\"\nThe three's eyes widened as Laeron continued.\n\"I noticed that that 'Queen Guinevere' was quite close to that 'Demon Empress' in the court room, they were even holding hands at the end there like a pair of girlpals. I have a gut feeling that folk tale of a King only made such a decision because he sided with his wife.\n\"I wonder how he'd react if he knew aside from being the legendary boy who pulled the sword from the stone that.... he was just as legendary of a cuck?\"",

      "content": "Arthur stood and walked off, leaving the Royal Court room alone.\nOne would have thought that he would bask in his decision, even try to reconnect with his wife and daughter immediately. Unfortunately, unlike Laeron made it seem, this wasn't a fairy tale. People don't change immediately, neither can relationships fractured over several decades be repaired in a day.\nAt this moment, Arthur was feeling quite desolate.\nPride was a hard thing to overcome, especially when it was your own. Now, Arthur had to come to grips with the fact that he would not only be handing over something he had worked his whole life to build, but in doing so would have to act like he was grateful.\nIt was a difficult thing for a man to set aside his pride. It was even more difficult for a King to do so. It was difficult to the point where even though Arthur knew that he stood at a diverging path – one facing his family and the other facing his kingdom – he still found this decision hard to swallow.\nThe Royal Court remained silent. It was taboo for a King to display such emotion and this could be the first time any of them had ever seen Arthur like this.\nGuinevere cast a glance toward Arthur's back but she hesitated. Her gaze wanted to shift to another place, but she didn't dare to look.\nTheir relationship had never borne any fruit, but Guinevere still felt all sort of complex emotions about it. Guilt, trepidation… but even those were accented by a budding sweetness and a freedom she hadn't felt in a long time.\nShe couldn't help but feel like she had taken advantage of Lancelot's feelings to make herself feel better. Such a thing filled her with a swirl of thoughts she didn't know how to deal with.\n\"Your Majesty.\"\nLeonel's sudden voice drifted to Guinevere's ears, stunning the Queen. She had never interacted with Leonel before and the start of such communication at this particular moment left her at a loss. If she was honest with herself, though she was grateful to Leonel, he was the last person she wanted to talk to now.\nHowever, Leonel's next words shook her to her core.\n\"Go speak with him and be as open and honest as possible.\"\nGuinevere froze, her hand involuntarily tightening around Mordred's.\nMordred, who had, of course, not been expecting this looked toward her mother. However, she couldn't hear Leonel's words at all.\n\"It will be difficult.\" Leonel continued. \"However, what Arthur needs the most now is your transparency. When a man loses everything, his family is his only pillar.\"\nGuinevere wanted to lash out at Leonel's words. However, she couldn't, not because she didn't have the mind to, but because she couldn't replicate Leonel's silent communication. This left her feeling overly stifled and her breathing even hitched, her grip tightening on Mordred's hand again.\nShe was a Queen. Maybe in some ways, the same pride that ran in Arthur's veins ran through her own.\nBut, it was even deeper than this, anyone being confronted about such an intimate matter would react defensively first. This would be the case even if two people were close, let alone if they couldn't have been closer to strangers like Leonel and Guinevere.\nThis in addition to the fact Guinevere was a woman while Leonel was a man, all added to the fact she was a Queen used to an unblemished and polished image… Guinevere felt a mixture of embarrassment, unwillingness, and unending grievances.\nAs if all this wasn't bad enough, Leonel was a kid in Guinevere's eyes. What did he know about being a man? Such words coming from the mouth of a teenage boy felt like a bunch of flowery nonsense without substance.\nHowever, Leonel knew he had no choice but to continue to push.\nWhen Arthur made his decision, he felt that feeling again, that feeling that something was about to change. Spark lit in his mind, but he had no way of fully connecting them. He had no choice but to act on his instincts and hope for the best.\n\"I know that hearing all of this from me fills you with feelings you don't know how to deal with, and I know that communicating with you in this way where you can't respond to me is even more stifling. I can't comfort you with any words outside of this.\n\"I only want you to know that I have the best interest of Camelot at heart. Have you wondered why it is I know about these things I shouldn't?\"\nLeonel's final question caused Guinevere to freeze completely. All her anger vanished with the wind, a deep trepidation gripping her heart.\n\"All I want you to ask yourself is if you would rather him hear it all from your lips? Or find out through the words of another?\"\nGuinevere clenched her jaw, her eyes reddening.\n\"Mo –\"\nMordred's words paused before she finished them. Could she really still call Guinevere mother? She didn't know if she was ready for such a thing yet…\nBut, she had no idea just the start of her words snapped Guinevere back to reality.\nGuinevere looked toward where Arthur disappeared and back toward her daughter.\n\"Mordred, I…\"\nGuinevere was completely flustered. She forgot about how she had address Mordred as Demon Empress all this time. A motherly tone involuntarily came from her.\nHowever, surprisingly, Mordred wasn't off put by this. In fact, she seemed to understand something as she smiled lightly.\n\"Go.\"\nGuinevere's eyes uncontrollably teared. If it wasn't for the court ministers having become lost in their own debates about the changes coming to Camelot, she would have instantly become the center of attention.\nThere were two that did notice though…\nHer son was the first and the second was Lancelot.\nGuinevere stood slowly, her hand still wrapped around her daughter's. She looked intently at Mordred as though making sure it was truly alright. She had already abandoned her daughter once, she couldn't stand the thought of doing it again.\nBut, seeing the reassuring gaze Mordred returned her, her back straightened, a certain determination lighting her beautiful eyes.\nShe released Mordred's hand, a light smile on her face. Back straight, she walked toward the direction her husband left in.\nFrom start to finish, she didn't look toward Lancelot. She seemed to be using her actions to convey something profound.. But, ultimately, it all led to the broken heart of a Knight.",

      "content": "\"I think I will return now.\" Mordred said softly, motioning toward Crakos.\nFrom start to finish, the #1 Demon Lord hadn't said a word and had simply observed things. Though he received many looks and several auras were constantly locked onto him, the Demon Lord always remained calm, restraining his own.\nLeonel nodded lightly. He knew that Mordred had gone through a lot today. The wounds she had suffered in her past couldn't be cured so quickly, but Leonel felt content that they were going in the right direction.\nHe and Mordred practically knew everything about one another. In many ways, Leonel felt that he was closer to her than he had ever been to James. Seeing her slowly coming back to her family left him feeling happy.\n\"What's with that smile?\" Mordred teased. \"Is big sis very beautiful?\"\nLeonel coughed, not knowing how to respond. But, his predictable reaction left the Demon Empress giggling.\nJust as Mordred was about to turn to leave, Leonel suddenly spoke out.\n\"Demo – Em, I take you to be one of my close friends now. I just wanted you to know that.\"\nMordred's steps froze, looking back toward Leonel with surprise.\nSeeing those clear, pale green eyes and that handsome, charismatic smile, she felt her heart shudder. For some reason, she felt her tears well up in her eyes.\nShe quickly dried them with a subtle use of Force, not letting them fall. Then, just as quickly as she had almost cried, she smiled a charming smile.\n\"Big sis has more to teach you about women. Rule number one is to not make them cry.\"\nMordred strolled away under the escort of several guards, clicking her tongue as though she was still reprimanding Leonel. But, in response, Leonel only chuckled.\n\"You must be happy having such a beautiful friend, hm?\"\nAina's voice disrupted Leonel's mood, causing his coughing fit to return.\n\"… It's fine, I'm pretty sure Em only likes women anyway.\" Leonel quickly recovered.\n\"So you mean that if she liked men instead you'd be happier?\"\n\"Ah…\"\nLeonel had been checkmated once again. He didn't know how all his insane thinking speed and people skills couldn't find him a path out of this.\nLuckily, he then heard Aina begin to giggle to herself, the soft bells of her laughter warming his heart.\nHe didn't know when Aina got such a teasing side to her. The two sides Leonel knew were either the overly shy Aina or the bloody killer Aina.\nWhat he didn't know was that Aina had no choice but to begin teasing Leonel like this. Before, it felt as though Leonel was always the one causing her to be flustered. Getting back at him now made her feel much better.\nMaybe even Aina herself didn't realize that in order to tease Leonel like this, she had to play into the fact they were a couple. Who knows how she'd react if she realized what her jokes meant…\nLeonel suddenly sighed, thinking back to Arthur and Guinevere.\n\"… Do you think we'd ever grow apart like that?\" He suddenly asked.\nAina froze. She hadn't even thought through herself what she felt for Leonel, she didn't even believe she had the time to think of such things now.\nBeing presented so suddenly with such a loaded question left her not knowing what to say for a long time.\n\"… Is it possible for you to grow distant from me?\"\nAina asked a question back herself.\nMaybe deep down she was also afraid of such a possibility. Leonel had pursued her so doggedly for years. She couldn't help but admit to herself that she thought he would have given up on her a long time ago.\nDuring those days, her best friends were Yuri and Savahn. Savahn especially used to always say that men were just like that. They loved the chase, but the moment they got something, they would soon grow bored and leave it behind for other things.\nThough Aina never really took much of her rants seriously, she had to admit to herself that thinking of this might have subconsciously been one of the reason she also never tried to respond to Leonel.\nThis had left her in a perpetual cycle where she never said yes but also never said no…\nShe never quite understood why Leonel was so infatuated with her. She hadn't been the most beautiful in their school, and now she was even further from that reality thanks to these scars. It was even possible that the reason she hadn't shut down Leonel's line of questioning like she would have usually done was precisely because she could no longer bury her curiosity…\nHowever, Leonel's response left her completely shaken.\n\"Yes. Yes, I could grow apart from you.\"\nAina couldn't explain it, but she felt as though her whole world was collapsing at that very moment. Her mind swam, her vision even blurring.\nShe hadn't expected a particular answer, but what she absolutely never expected was for a response to be able to flip her world upside down like this.\nThe feeling was so real and undeniable that even she couldn't mistake what it was any longer.\nIt hurt. Like a twisting knife at her heart, it tore her apart.\nHer vision blurred. But, it was hard to tell if it was due to tears or if it was the foggy state her mind had entered.\n\"But…\" Leonel continued. \"… That's if and only if you stop trusting me.\"\nAina's breath, hitched and hiccupped like she couldn't hear Leonel at all. It felt as though she couldn't breathe enough air, as though there wasn't enough oxygen in the world. Every huff she took felt filled with smoke.\n\"Aina.\"\nLeonel frowned, gripping onto Aina's hands.\nIn her panicked state, she tried to shake Leonel's arms off her. She used such force that Leonel was almost thrown across the room. But, he held onto her tightly, gripping the sides of her face and forcing her to look at him.\nBy this point, Leonel had already put up a [Light Refraction] spell. He hadn't expected Aina to react so violently, but the last thing she needed now was to be seen by others.\nAina struggled, but Leonel didn't let her slip away.\n\"Aina.\"\nLeonel's deep, rumbling voice seemed to finally cut deep enough, shaking Aina out of her panicked state.\n\"I am a person who severs his emotions easily when I find a logical reason to do so. The only reason it was hard for me to kill for a long time was? because I felt my life was worth the same as anyone else's. So, why should I kill them just for me to survive? Sometimes I even fear that one day I really will feel that I am better than others and will no longer have a reason to hold back...\n\"However, at the same time, for a very long while, I believed that my mother had abandoned me. Since the day I drew that conclusion, I never thought of her, dreamed of her, or pined after her.\"\nThe more Leonel spoke, the more Aina seemed to calm down. The rushing tides of her heart slowed to a normal ebb and flow, her breathing slowly returning to normal.\nLeonel eased his hands away, his gaze becoming much more gentle.\n\"I know that you have a heavy burden on your heart. All I want you to know is that I'm here to bear it with you. I just want you to trust me, lean on me. Never go off on your own and do something stupid because I will not come to save you. Do you understand me?\"\nAina's pupils trembled.\nWhere were the words of romance? Where were the talks of running through the fires of hell and smashing the gates of heaven to make it back to her?\nBut, no… These weren't the words that Leonel spoke.\n\"As long as you trust me, place your whole faith in me, lean on me like I will lean on you… If you can do this, I swear on my life that I will never leave your side.\"\nThe tears in Aina's eyes could no longer be held back. They fell like an endless flood. This time, she knew exactly why her vision had blurred.\nAnd, maybe it was exactly because her vision blurred that she couldn't react in time. Before she knew what was happening, she felt something hot and heavy press over her lips.\nHer heart seemed to explode. Feelings she had never felt before kept bubbling forth.\nWarmth. Sweetness. Anxiousness.\nAs though butterfly wings had spread within her chest, she felt like she was floating on a cloud.\n...\n[Author's Note below (12/9/21)!]",

      "content": "It wasn't the most romantic kiss as kisses went.\nIn the stories, the couple would be on a hill by a setting sun or beneath the rain and awashed in emotions. But, there was no beautiful scenery to be seen. In fact, with a look around, there was nothing but a bland Royal Court still suffused with a heavy atmosphere.\nIn the stories, maybe some loving words would have just been said. But, Leonel had just finished with telling Aina that he had no intention of saving her if she went off and did something stupid on her own.\nIn the stories, the female lead would be gorgeous and flawless. But, Aina was still scarred. Even as he kissed her, Leonel could feel the imperfections running across her lips.\nStill, even with all of this said, Leonel felt as though he was on the top of the world. To veterans of love, Leonel had barely given Aina a peck on the lips. But to him, it felt as though he had conquered the world. It felt better than anything he had ever experienced before… no game he had ever won, no battle he had ever claimed victory in, no complicated thought he had ever finished could match up to the euphoria he was experiencing now.\nIt was only when Leonel sensed his hastily put up [Light Refraction] spell wavering that he retreated despite his reluctance. However, his actions allowed him to see a scene he would never forget.\nAina still sat on her chair, her legs swung in his direction. But, her two hands were over her heart, one balled into a fist and the other wrapped around it. They pressed against her chest as though she was trying to stop her heart from escaping.\nHer lips were slightly separated and trembling, her breathing wild an erratic. A blush travelled up from her neck and through her face, not missing even her trembling eyelids that still hung closed.\nThough she only remained in this position for a fraction of a moment, Leonel's burned the image into his mind, even down to the way she slightly leaned forward as though subconsciously asking for more.\n\"Ah!\"\nAina awoke from her stupor, the flash of crimson across her face and neck deepening by several shades.\n\"You… You… I…\"\nAina's words stuttered.\nLeonel grinned like a madman, the deep, rumbling cadence of his heart making his emotions clear.\n\"You can't deny that you like me now, right?\"\n\"I… You…\" Aina was speechless.\nShe stood up quickly, wanting to run away. But, this time, Leonel grabbed onto her wrist.\n\"… Don't run anymore… Okay?\" Leonel's grin faded and his tone softened.\nAina's chest heaved, her breath feeling short once again. But, seeing the look in Leonel's eyes made her shudder, a wave of guilt overwhelming her.\nShe took deep breaths, allowing Leonel to lightly hold onto her wrist. She looked down at him from her standing position, her gaze a wild mix of emotions. But, Leonel's own remained steady, like a pillar waiting for her to lean on it.\n\"… Okay…\" Aina nodded almost imperceptibly, her voice as quiet as the wings of a butterfly.\nLeonel smiled. It was no longer a wild grin, but it had a level of peace to it that made Aina almost start shedding tears again.\nLeonel rose to his full height. The way he almost cast a shadow over Aina made her oddly feel at peace, the erratic beat of her heart finally slowing to a crawl.\n\"Lean on me from now on, alright?\"\nAina looked up as Leonel stroked her hair. For some reason, she no longer felt shy or apprehensive. She even felt quite calm.\nShe nodded almost imperceptibly again.\nFor the first time in a long while, Leonel felt relaxed. Standing here like this as though they were in their own world despite everything going on around them felt like a remedy to all that had ailed him.\nSince the Metamorphosis began, he had lost contact with his only family, he had lost his home, he had constantly been on the run or in a perpetual state of battle… Ironically, the first time he truly got any semblance of rest was while he was negotiating for peace on Mordred's behalf.\nBut now, he had found a self-sustaining peace. He felt that no matter where he was or what he was doing, even if he was in the midst of blood and war… As long as she was by his side he would never feel so lost again.\nYou know, people say that all the emotions one put into something never paid off when you truly received it…\nAthletes spent their whole lives working toward becoming the best of the best, but after winning it all once, it never quite felt the same afterward.\nThe richest men and women in the world devote themselves to growing their net worth to heights still yet unseen, but no matter how much they make, it will never feel as good as the first 100 000 they made.\nThis seemed to just be human nature.\nYet, even after Leonel spent five years chasing Aina, even as their relationship slowly became closer over the last year… he swore to himself that none of it could compare to this moment.\nIt couldn't be described as a tsunami of emotions but could rather be summarized in a single word…\nContentment.\nWhen Leonel pulled himself out of his languid daze, he grinned once again.\n\"You know, we have yet to have our first date as a newly minted couple.\"\n\"Huh?\" Aina was shocked awake by Leonel's words. She wanted to refute, but couldn't seem to find the words to. She had already promised not to run away any longer, but she was shocked by the sudden labeling of their relationship.\nLeonel's grin only grew wider.\n\"I don't think we should have a normal first date, though. Wouldn't that be too boring? A picnic or a stroll at the park doesn't really suit us, don't you think?\"\nAina raised her brows, her amber irises almost reflecting gold as she looked toward Leonel. She seemed to understand what he was getting at.\n\"What better first date for us than a date to kill?\"\nLeonel's grin suddenly became somewhat sinister.",

      "content": "Laeron, Zindi, Matteus, and Ameron still hadn't left. How could they, they were waiting for a proper opportunity.\nThe truth was that although Laeron's plan was excellent, executing it would be far more difficult. It wasn't as though they could just plop a bunch of novels and movies in front of King Arthur and expect him to read and watch them all.\nWhether he even would was one matter, but by the time he did it would probably already be too late. Who cared if Arthur threw a fit after Camelot had already been assimilated by The Empire? By then, they could just send someone to kill him with ease and it wouldn't matter in the slightest.\n\"… Our best bet is most definitely an illusion specialist. It will be difficult finding one strong enough to cause him to fall, and even more expensive, but it will be worth it. It's the most seamless option we have.\"\nThe four of them seemed to all agree with this.\nKing Arthur's strength was something they looked down upon initially, until they were in the same room as the man. They couldn't deny the pressure he placed on them, it was undeniable.\n\"Not a bad plan.\"\nThe four were stunned. If these word had been spoken by one of them, it would be fine. The issue was that it most definitely hadn't been. And, to make things worse, they recognized the voice it was spoken by as well.\nLeonel slowly walked out of the forest, causing the four to be shaken. How had they not heard his approach until just now? That was impossible.\nAmeron's gaze narrowed, his golden eyes piercing toward Leonel.\nUnfortunately, before they could focus too much on Leonel, another, much louder set a footsteps caught their attention. They spun around, only to find Aina walking forward with a great sword dragging in her hands across the forest floor. Compared to the flustered girl she had been just a while prior, her current cold expression seemed worlds apart.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nA little mink dashed along the tree branches, appearing from a third direction.\n\"Leonel, what do you think you're doing?!\"\nMatteus could no longer hold back his temper. Leonel had already infuriated him enough once, but this blatant provocation was too much for any human to handle.\n\"Do you understand what you're doing, kid?\" Zindi cut in, her green eyes locking onto Leonel.\n\"Enlighten me.\"\nInstead of taking these words as an opportunity, the four hidden family members only grew more enraged toward Leonel's response. They didn't want to have to explain themselves to a child, and it seemed even more pathetic to do so. Those who had strength didn't need to speak, they could just do. They didn't have to convince anyone of anything.\n\"No takers?\" Leonel almost pouted in disappointment.\nTruthfully, he was looking forward to learning more about these hidden families. Other than seeing their hair color, he knew nothing else about them.\nWell, he did know a bit about the Brazinger family's Lineage Factor thanks to Aina. But, this was about it.\nLeonel shook his head.\n\"I'll give you four two options.\n\"The first option is to surrender. Allow us to escort you to a holding cell within Camelot until negotiations are complete. After this, we will release you and you can go about your business.\n\"The second is to battle. Should you do this, however, you will definitely die.\"\nLeonel didn't add any flowery words of encouragement or any coercion in the slightest. He simply laid out the facts as they were.\nThese four had no idea, but they were facing two opponents who had already stepped into the Fourth Dimension. Not only had Aina done so, but the little mink had done so as well. On top of that, there was Leonel whose ability was already at the pinnacle of the Fifth Dimension and was supported by a mind within the Fourth.\nWith only four of them… they simply stood no chance.\nThe truth was that Leonel suspected that Ameron had already stepped into the Fourth Dimension. He could tell simply by observing him that he was different from the other three. But, Leonel didn't believe that this would make a large difference.\nStill, Leonel made a mental note that he needed to understand more about the Fourth Dimension. Because he didn't have the latter portions of [Dimensional Cleanse], he was flying in the dark about how the power systems of the Fourth Dimension functioned. As such, he found it difficult to scan the 'stats' of someone within this Dimension.\nHowever, Leonel's gut feeling told him that the combination of Aina and the little mink was more than enough to deal with this golden haired man. As for the other three… they were his.\n\"So, which choice will you make.\"\nLeonel brandished his bow, his demeanor calm and collected.\nThe four began to sweat. This wasn't just a problem of facing the three before them. The main issue was that they were still in enemy territory.\nDefeating these brats was one thing, but what if Camelot mobilized an army? What would they do then?\nThey didn't feel that these three were stupid enough to come without requesting any sort of back up assistance… right? They couldn't have?\nLeonel's lip curled into a smile. The most important thing about applying pressure on a person wasn't how much you applied, but when you applied it.\nIf you used all your tactics immediately on a strong minded individual, they would all fall flat. But, if you simply poked at someone when they were in their most fragile state…\nThey would collapse like a house of cards.\nLeonel pointed toward the green haired lady.\n\"You have a Lineage Factor that has great synergy with plants. In your mind, you're probably undefeatable in a forest facing opponents like us, right? You're probably even more confident than a usual member of your family because your ability is an A-grade Harden ability that reinforces the chemical structure of objects to make them tougher than the strongest diamonds and the best alloys… is that right?\n\"Quite a great synergy of your abilities. Would be quite a hassle to deal with a flood of vines all harder than the sharpest swords.\"\nZindi shuddered, the subtle movements she had made to control the vegetation in the surroundings coming to a grinding halt.\nLeonel's smirk deepened, pointing toward Matteus.\n\"And you…\"",

      "content": "\"… Your Lineage Factor is quite interesting. A defensive type Lineage Factor that relies on the fluidity of your body, is that right? Your ability is a C-grade sharpened sight ability that also synergizes well with your Lineage Factor. I'm sure you're good at hand to hand combat, commendable.\"\nLeonel spoke with a smile, his demeanor relaxed.\n\"There's also you.\" Leonel continued. \"Your Light Elemental Lineage Factor is quite intriguing, focusing on your attack strength, hm? I'm sure that pairing that with your Fifth Dimensional Wind Elemental ability helps you quite a bit, right?\"\nAmeron's gaze narrowed further. Leonel's words had subtly revealed the fact he was quite aware of his strength yet still dared to stand here.\nAmong those here, he was the only one with an ability that touched the realms of the Fifth Dimension, or so he thought. But now that Leonel was speaking so nonchalantly, he wasn't confident in this matter any longer. Was this brat more dangerous than he originally thought?\n\"And you.\" Leonel's smile faded, his gaze locking onto Laeron, the red-haired Brazinger family member.\n\"Your Lineage Factor is related to your blood and your bodily strength. As for your ability, it's of the S-grade and only gives you perfect recall of events, is that right?\"\nLeonel's cheerfulness had completely vanished. Even as a method of applying pressure, he couldn't stand to continue putting up such a fa?ade for a man from that family.\n\"So, what is your choice?\" Leonel continued coldly.\nThe pressure was palpable.\nIn this world, one of the most protected secrets of a person was their ability. When it came down to a crucial moment, what an opponent did or didn't know about your ability could decide your life and death.\nThe simple truth was that abilities came in all shapes and sizes. And, even if by some miracle two people received two near identical abilities, the methods by which they used them could be strikingly different.\nIn a fictional world, everyone had set and predictable patterns that could be used to follow an opponent's intentions in the midst of battle. But, in the real world, a burly man could just as easily bring out a strong wind affinity, a person with a strong Fire Lineage Factor could easily be born with a Water Elemental ability, it was even possible for a close combat specialist to be even better in the long range simply due to an ability they were born with.\nSo, one could imagine how it might feel to have your abilities displayed so grandly. And, not only that, but for their Lineage Factors to be exposed as well. Almost any thoughts they had of surprise or trickery vanished.\nIt was at that moment that Laeron suddenly began to laugh.\n\"You know, all this time I was wondering why it was you hated me so much.\" Laeron's laughter grew, his blood boiling. \"So that's why, that's why… I get it, I get it…\"\nLeonel calmly weighed his black bow in his hands, his gaze never leaving the four before him.\nLaeron's gaze turned toward Aina and his laughter only grew.\n\"… Brats, I have nothing to do with the matters of all those years ago. I'm not sure why you're targeting me for the actions of a few. Those people you want to kill me for only treat me slightly better than the piece of dirt they see those of impure blood as.\"\nLaeron's gaze reddened. Clearly, he was feeling indignant.\nHis feelings made sense, for the most part. He obviously didn't receive very great treatment from the family. Maybe it was because his talent wasn't as great, maybe it was because his ability didn't have very great offensive prowess, or maybe it was because he didn't have much backing within the family itself.\nRegardless of the reason, being targeted because of the actions of someone you didn't like very much to begin with wasn't a pleasant feeling.\nOf course Laeron remembered Aina. Leonel had just described his ability as perfect recall. It could be said that the only reason he didn't recognize Aina immediately was because it had been almost two decades since he last saw her from afar.\nIn fact, it wasn't even Aina's looks. No, what he remembered was the exact pattern of the scars drawn across her face. This was his perfect recall at work… How could two women have the exact same pattern of scars?\nLeonel's gaze narrowed at Laeron's words, but he still nodded slightly. Even though he wanted to reject Laeron's words due to his own bias, he knew that not accepting such a thing and hating him just because of the family he came from would make him no different from the Brazinger family.\n\"Like I've said already, if you want to live then just surrender yourselves. I'll release you all just the same.\"\n\"And you expect me to believe that?\"\n\"Do you have a choice? Do you really think we came here alone? The only reason the others haven't closed in is because there's no need to risk innocent lives when it could all be resolved by us. But, if you force us to act, even if by some miracle you manage to defeat the three of us, there'll be a world's Kingdom waiting to deal with you.\"\nLaeron and the others shuddered. The only one who still managed to remain a semblance of calm was Ameron.\nAfter a long while, Ameron sighed.\n\"Kids are getting more and more brazen everyday. We asked you if you really knew what you were getting into before, but the question still remains the same. Are you sure you know what you're getting into?\"\nLeonel shook his head. \"Seems you're the one still not getting it. Sir Lancelot!\"\nAt that moment, the clanking of armor sounded.\nAmeron's confident expression finally changed. In the seemingly quiet forest, the sound of unsheathing blades and rattling chainmail rebounded through the greenery.\nSomehow, without their knowledge, an entire troop of knights had surrounded them from all directions.\nAt this point, Ameron realized he had been played. Though Leonel was maybe confident in defeating them all, doing so while also preventing them from having enough time to activate their talismans to return to Earth would have been too difficult.\nSo, he stalled for time.\nNow where would they go?",

      "content": "Leonel watched as the four were escorted away.\nHe felt better than he thought he would. Being able to resolve things with his words again rather than his fists left him feeling light.\nWell, technically he still relied on strength this time around. If it wasn't for his vastly improved method of using Camelot's Mage Art magic system, it would have been impossible for him to hide so much movement from them all, this was especially considering Laeron's perfect recall ability. If there was even a single blade of grass out of place, he likely would have been seen through.\nStill, Leonel was happy. He didn't have anything to complain about. He could only hope that the negotiations The Empire went as smoothly.\nUnfortunately, Leonel could only be hopeful about this. The power imbalance between The Empire and them, even if Camelot and the Demon Empire came together, was too large. He obviously couldn't use bully tactics as he had just done if this was the case.\n\"Are you sure we'll be able to hold him?\"\nA sudden voice cut into Leonel's thoughts. When he looked over, he found Lancelot's figure beside him.\nLancelot was wearing the same smile he always his did. His mood seemed great. But, Leonel was quite aware that much of this was a fa?ade.\nA leader of men didn't always have the luxury of wearing his heart on his sleeve. This was a curse that it seemed both Lancelot and Arthur were afflicted with.\nLeonel nodded. \"The restrictions I placed on him are modified Three Star Magus Arts. Though they're not able to stop him completely, it will take him some effort to break them even if he goes all out. My estimates sits at … seven seconds. By the time he breaks it, I'll already be aware and that time is enough for me to activate the teleportation key I hid on him.\"\nLancelot nodded with some assurance, his smile as bright as ever.\n\"About these negotiations, Leonel. I'm curious about this Ascension Empire and what joining them means for Camelot.\"\nLeonel sighed. \"The Ascension Empire is just like any other. Its main focus is growth, expansion and holding onto its power. In the past, what mattered most was your talent and now what also matters most is still your talent. In truth, I wouldn't say that it's any different from Camelot. The only difference is that compared to being at the top like you are now, you will have to fight to hold such a position again.\"\nLeonel swept a glance toward Lancelot, half expecting him to defend Camelot and speak words about how much they loved their people and other similar things.\nIn truth, Leonel was being quite kind to Camelot. Compared to The Empire, Camelot treated its 'lesser-thans' far worse. At least on the surface, anyway.\nLeonel would never forget that The Empire allowed billions to die just so that it would be easier to deal with Invalid tides. In fact, much of the reason Leonel didn't run into an Invalid despite the early stages Earth was in was precisely because of this.\nOther worlds in similar positions would have to spend centuries fighting against Invalids. By the time they established themselves, their worlds would have to be separated in safe and unsafe zones.\nBut, by killing so much immediately, Earth never had to deal with this problem. And, with the exception of the oceans where humans couldn't normally reside anyway, everywhere else was still reasonably safe.\nSometimes, Leonel couldn't help but wonder how much of the invention of Paradise Islands were about land shortage… and how much was a plan for this all along…\n\"I see.\" Lancelot nodded, not a hint of derision on his face. \"I hope they will be better at finding talents than we have been.\"\nLancelot smiled somewhat sadly, a slight crack showing in his usual fa?ade.\n\"I didn't have an opportunity to say it before, but I'm sorry for what happened to you. To think that you would also be our savior as well, how ironic.\"\nLeonel gave a slight chuckle. \"I can't take credit for that, it wasn't intentional. In truth, I did it mostly to save my own life. It's just that my selfishness happened to help others.\"\n\"Selfishness, huh…?\" Lancelot sighed, his blue irises dimming somewhat. \"… It's unfortunate that selfishness isn't always possible, and selflessness isn't always rewarded.\"\nLeonel remained silent for a long while before finally speaking.\n\"Selflessness can only be rewarded after selfishness has finished taking everything it wants first. After that, the selfless can only find time and space to heal.\"\nLancelot froze. He looked toward Leonel's side profile, his pupils visibly trembling.\nWas it just a coincidence?\nLeonel's words seemed to resonate with Lancelot's soul.\n'Time and space to heal…'\nAt that moment, the ground beneath their feet began to shake.\nLeonel's gaze sharpened. 'It's here? That was enough?'\nAll this time, Leonel had felt a feeling tugging at the back of his mind. However, his Dreamscape didn't seem capable of finding the answer. So, Leonel did it himself.\nLeonel's mind was even more powerful than maybe even he himself knew. The more he thought about it, the more possibilities he crossed off… the more he realized that there was only one possible explanation left…\nThe Zone quests hadn't ended yet.\nCamelot had already become a part of true history and Leonel had already saved King Arthur from a fate of death, if he could just resolve the love triangle, everything would be perfect.\nBut… there was one issue with this.\nLeonel couldn't possibly kill Mordred. Let alone the fact that he wouldn't have the heart to do so even if he didn't know her so well, they were now intimately acquainted. To Leonel, killing Mordred would feel no different from killing any one of his teammates. He couldn't bear it.\nBut, that moment when he called Mordred his friend, something clicked.\nZones were not a game so their quests didn't exist just for the sake of existing. The quests were in place as guides to those who entered, allowing them to help along the resolution of the Zone as a whole.\nThis was a simple matter. Leonel had long since learned as much during his time within the Joan Zone.\nWhat did all of this mean, then? It meant that the quests themselves were not as important as the function they served!\nSaving King Arthur. Resolving the love triangle. Killing Mordred. Making King Arthur a part of true history…\nWhat did all of these quests have in common? It was all about resolving Arthur as a person, helping him to complete his character arc.\nOften times it was difficult for someone who had been wronged to forgive. There was definitely a timeline of events where Mordred would never forgive her father and even choose to continue her attempts to kill him.\nWhen a person is too far gone, despite how tragic their pasts might be, the crudest way to deal with them would be to kill them…\nIn such a reality, Arthur would mourn the loss of his daughter with his wife and son while Lancelot, being the good man that he is, would take a step back and allow the family to come together. In such a way, Mordred's death would become the catalyst to truly heal Arthur of his ailments.\nBut… What if Mordred didn't choose that path? What if she was alright with reconnecting with her family? What if… she made the first friend she ever had?\nIn such a case, wouldn't it fulfill the same requirements as her death would have?\nThe savior of King Arthur. The manifestation of Camelot. The resolution of the love triangle. The 'death' of Mordred.\nThe sound of shattering glass resounded throughout the small moon as the world continued to tremble.\nLeonel felt his heart suddenly thrum to life. It wasn't just him, but every citizen of Earth's world felt the very same way at that exact moment.\nIt was then Leonel understood what his actions meant.\nEarth was evolving into a Fourth Dimensional world.\nHowever, Leonel expected what happened next even less.",

      "content": "It had been several weeks since the disappearance of Leonel and Aina. By now, those who had spectated the Brave City trials were well aware that these two youths would not have to participate.\nOf course, many had an understanding of exactly what this meant. For these two to be personally escorted by the overseers and then disappear, there was a high likelihood that both Leonel and Aina were given the rights to directly enter Valiant Heart Mountain.\nUnfortunately, there was nothing the others could do about this. Without a choice, they could only continue to follow the proceedings, hoping to gain a spot for themselves.\nStill, this was the real world. Hopes and dreams couldn't be manifested at will, nor could strong desires make one more talented or wield more power. The so-called 'geniuses' of Terrain fell one after another beneath the trials and it very much seemed as though this would be a repeat of every other year prior where not a single person was selected.\nHowever, it was exactly then that a young man stood out.\nThe story of Anared Kaefir, the Heir to the Kaefir City Lord title was quite an interesting one. Since his youth, he had always been known as the genius of Terrain just as much as he had been known for his insane tendencies.\nHe was a man who protected his little sister to a fault and was even quite protective of his little sister's best friend as well, though she could be a bit of a ditz. However, the truth was that Anared had always been within the realm of understanding for those of Terrain.\nThough he was lauded and praised, he was ultimately just one of a long line of geniuses that wouldn't amount to much at all in the Dimensional Verse. Terrain was too small, the talents it could produce were too weak, and the starting point of those talents it did manage to produce were too low…\nWith these shackles on his future progress, Anared participated in the last Brave City trial. Without suspense, just like all those who came before him, he failed.\nThe memory was still quite vivid in the eyes of those who had witnessed it all.\nThere were a total of eight trials to complete. In order to be accepted into Valiant Heart Mountain as the lowest tier disciple, it was necessary to pass at least the fourth. But back then, Anared only managed to make it halfway through the second trial.\nThe trial was a sea of wooden puppets. The only task was to make it from one side of the room to the other, but for so many, it was a trial they would never pass.\nAs a mere King back then, Anared scratched and clawed, his eyes a furious shade of red. Even when he was forcefully pulled out of the trial by the overseers at that time, his gaze was still wholly focused on the goal ahead of him. He looked like he would rather die than not make it to the other side.\nIt was impossible to tell what his motivation was. Who could read the mind of a madman?\nDid he just want to get stronger? Did he have something to protect? Something he wanted to accomplish?\nNo one knew.\nBut those red eyes and the way he clung to the broken hilt of his sword was seared into the minds of all those who watched that day.\nAfter failing the trial, it became hard to hear of Anared again. All people knew was that he went off to travel for several years, even missing the next entry to Brave City. Many thought he had given up due to that… But, no one blamed him.\nHe was a talented young man who went to see the world and even managed to come back with a beautiful wife. There was no doubt that Heira was a preeminent beauty of Terrain. Not only this, but she also had the refined demeanor of a lady.\nBut, what no one expected was for Anared to participate in this one as well. Not only for him to succeed… but for him to completely out perform his previous limitations.\nMany thought that Anared was at most on par with the other Emperors. In fact, due to the way he reacted when the other Emperors came to apply pressure to his Sector, many confirmed this belief.\nBut, once again, no one could get a read on the thoughts of a madman.\nHe crossed the third trial and faced the fourth. Many Emperors of the past had reached this level but could never clear it.\nIt was a trial that tested one's movement speed and flexibility, a death obstacle course of swinging blades and shadow-hidden assassins.\nYet, Anared crossed it with ease. With a sword in his hand, his movements became like flowing water.\nEven as the other Emperors failed at this step, he crossed into the fifth trial, then the sixth.\nIn the end, under the astonished gazes of all those around him, Anared made it through the seventh and almost all the way through the eighth before he was forced to stop.\nBeaten and bloodied, he stood on the final eighth floor, the jagged bladed ax of a giant having stopped just before his neck. Even at that moment, a defiant look blazed within his eyes. He kept looking up at the giant as though he still wanted to hack it to pieces. It was clear to anyone who saw him that he was still unsatisfied with his result.\nZilar watched on from afar, his hands tightly gripped around his broken spear shaft. He hadn't even been able to pass through the first trial. No amount of fire in his gut or will in his soul could help him overcome his lack of talent at the moment.\nAll sorts of complex feelings shook his core as he watched Anared proceed to where no one of Terrain had ventured before. It was as though watching Anared do it gave him even more determination to do it himself. He too would reach that level one day, he too would shock everyone with a single feat.",

      "content": "Anared calmly received his spatial ring, the sword hovering to his back still singing. It was clear that his battle intent was still roaring, but there was no longer a trial to face. He had failed to clear the final hurdle.\nAfter a few words from the overseers, everyone was ejected from Brave City. Another round had come to an end, it would be several more years until Brave City opened up its tall, bloodthirsty gates once again.\n…\nDays later, within the Kaefir family City Lordship, a meeting was taking place. But, if those who understood the relations between the City Lords saw this meeting, they would be shocked out of their wits.\nNot only was the forever lone wolf Black family City Lord present, but even the Swan family City Lord who had always butted heads with the Kaefir family was present!\nTo make matters more shocking, this was just one of the usually estranged or clashing relationships in the room. City Lords from all over Terrain were gathered, each one with a complicated network of relationships with those around them.\nYet… each and every single one of them had set aside their differences to appear at this meeting.\nThe setting was a room reserved for grand banquets. Elaborate chandeliers hung in the air, long tables that extended for tens of meters seated those numbering in the several dozen, while the decorations were designed to impress.\nThough this wasn't the most appropriate location for such a meeting, it was the only place that could house so many important characters.\nIt wasn't that there were hundreds of City Lords on Terrain. In fact, there were only a dozen. The main issue was that none of these City Lords, due to what was at stake, would want to appear here unguarded and unprotected.\nThe luck of it was that since these City Lords had brought their entourages to Brave City in the first place, they wouldn't draw the attention of those they wanted to hide their actions from. In fact, the fact they had all appeared in such a large banquet rather than slinking off sneakily made this even less of a matter to pay attention to.\nOf course, there was one other big reason this would work despite how foolish it was…\nThey all had a reason to attend this banquet. And, that reason was provided to them by the success of Anared Kaefir!\nCity Lord Kaefir stood from his hosting position, a confident smile on his face. Even his full beard couldn't hide the grin on his lips.\n\"You all know the rules.\"\nThese were the first words the City Lord said. As for what the 'rules' were, only they knew that.\n\"Since my son has met the goal we all set, I will be taking the lead of this operation as previously agreed upon. I hope that there would be no rejections to this, right?\"\nThe banquet hall remained silent.\nThey weren't fools. They knew that anyone who rocked the boat now would be immediately executed, City Lord or not. It was precisely because of how volatile this seemingly genial atmosphere was that they all brough their guards despite the lack of secrecy that could cause.\nIt was only with the status provided by Anared that they could execute this operation with less worries. As such, it was only right the Kaefir family took the lead. It was just unfortunate that none of their own Heirs could have the same accomplishments.\nHearing such words, the various guards and lesser vassals of the City Lords looked around in confusion. What they didn't know was that the so-called 'rules' were exactly in place to cause this sort of vagueness and unassuredness.\nThis operation had been being planned for years. Actually, it was more accurate to say that it had been decades.\nIn all this time, this was the very first instance in which all the City Lords had come together. In fact, this was the very first time they all had a direct line of communication with one another.\nOther than City Lord Kaefir, the others hadn't even been sure that all the City Lords would participate. It was only now that they were all certain that everyone was on board.\nBut, it was exactly this secrecy and this slyness that gave the City Lords confidence. There were eyes and ears everywhere, especially in this era of abilities.\nIt could be said that City Lord Kaefir had proved himself. Even if Anared had failed, they would have still elected him to be the leader of this operation…\nThis operation was too important to them. It could be said that even in the case of Anared failing, they would have moved forward regardless. When it came to matters of life and death and the futures of their coming generations, they had to be prepared.\n\"Good. I want everyone to be ready to move out within the month.\"\n…\nThe month quickly came and went.\nThe City Lords had been prepared to move out any day for the last five years already. Let alone being prepared within a month, they had long since primed themselves.\nAmong these twelve City Lords, there were four women. And, among these women, there was one with a very complicated relationship with City Lord Kaefir.\nThough the common people didn't dare to spread rumors about City Lords, what was to stop the City Lords themselves from doing so?\nIt was said that in their youth, this City Lord White was once a lover of City Lord Kaefir. However, for whatever reason, City Lord Kaefir married another who gave birth to his current son and daughter.\nAccording to the rumors, City Lord White visited the Kaefir City Lordship just once in the last 30 years… And it was said that she brought a baby along with her back then… But, when she left, that baby was no longer on her person.\nRegardless of whether those rumors were true or not, City Lord White had long since returned to her city.. The thoughts of all those years ago had long since been thrust from her mind.",

      "content": "City Lord White sat in an office, a map spread out across her desk. She had long since memorized its contents, but due to a sudden change that happened a while ago, she wanted to ensure that she had it all imprinted into her mind.\nThe City Lord was quite unique in comparison to other women of Terrain. It was very rare to find technologically advanced places like Earth and thus even rarer to find equality amongst men and women – at least in low level worlds.\nTechnology acted as an equating factor between men and women. The strength of a man meant less if a woman could simply pull out a gun and deal with a threat just as easily as he could.\nIn low level worlds like Terrain, the awakening of abilities didn't have much time to create a balance between the sexes like technology could.\nThis was all to say that in Terrain and worlds like it, having women in positions of power was a rarity. And, finding women like City Lord White was even a level more rare.\nCity Lord White had exceptionally short-cut white hair. Her demeanor was quite valiant and she chose to wear black robes accented by white flexible armor. Everything from the way she sat and spoke seemed to exude a masculine air. Even her handwriting was boisterous, purposeful and bold.\nShe was quite tall, especially for a woman. She stood at over six feet, but this didn't dampen her figure in the slightest. Her hips were wide and her bosom was bountiful.\nAt that very moment, seemingly without reason, City Lord White froze.\nShe stood, a sadistic grin on her face. Her face even became somewhat flushed as though she was excited.\nShe touched a spatial bracer on her right arm. Her gaze only grew more excited after pulling out a talisman glowing with a blinding light.\nIt was finally time.\nBANG!\nShe smashed a fist against her large desk, splitting it in half and kicking its pieces out of her way.\nHer hand swept forward and snatched out the map before it could fall to the ground, carelessly tossing it into her spatial bracer.\n\"Someone get me my Clara! Now!\"\nHer booming voice shot over White City. An impossibly vast aura shot out from the City Lord's body. The result was a city that fell into immediate silence.\nIt didn't matter if it was a noble or a humble street vendor, they all felt their knees buckle.\nThe City Lord's mansion began to glow.\nCity Lord White kicked down the door of her office.\nTo the side of the now broken opening, a patient secretary with her hands respectfully clasped before her sent a glance toward the flying door and didn't seem to react very much at all.\nCity Lord White turned toward the secretary, a bloodthirsty light in her eye. It was difficult to tell if she was excited, enraged, or in heat.\n\"Niya, give me my Clara, we're moving out!\"\n\"Yes, City Lord.\" The secretary bowed politely.\nWith a small clap of her hands, a light appeared in the secretary's hands and slowly expanded.\nEventually, when that light dimmed, all that was left was a monstrosity of a weapon.\nIt had a polearm of two and a half meters long alone. But, the true shock was its head. It was a hammer, but even calling it so seemed to not do it justice.\nThe head had two massive blunt ends that shimmered like the surface of a mirror. Each head just under a meter in diameter each, easily matching more than half the size of most bodies.\nCity Lord White snatched this massive weapon from Niya's hands.\n\"Ah, Clara, Clara, Clara. We're going to taste blood again!\"\n'Clara' seemed to react to these words too, a shimmering light racing across its polished surface.\nCity Lord White strolled down the hallways of her mansion, wantonly swinging 'Clara' around and not giving a damn about the damage. Niya could only follow quickly behind, calmly taking note of all the newly created holes and sending out orders for repair.\nThe two quickly made their way out of the mansion, every one of City Lord White's steps causing the ground to sway and tremble.\nThe head of City Lord White's mansion was completely unlike what one would expect. While others would pave the way for vehicles or decorate with elaborate gardens, the front of the White Mansion was a military field.\nOn this military field, tens of thousands of warriors had already gotten into formation. They all stood ramrod straight, their chests sticking out with pride.\n\"HAI!\"\nThe instant City Lord White appeared, a collective breath was taken as the army roared as one.\nThe crisp sound of shifting clothing pierced through the soul as they saluted in unison, crossing their hands over their hearts.\nCity Lord White stood atop the stairs of her mansion, her smothering aura towering into the skies.\nBANG!\nThe butt of her massive weapon smashed against the ground, causing waves of trembling earth to spread in every direction. To her back, Niya continued to stand, her hands clasped together respectfully.\nThe importance of this battle wasn't lost on any of them. This was a turning point.\nFor a long time already, Terrain had been teetering at the very edge, standing at the start of a diverging path.\nTo one side, there was the abandonment of everything their Ancestors had ever built, everything they had ever strived for.\nTo the other, there was a slim hope. But it required their sweat, their tears, their blood. And, even then, they could very well fail.\nTheir future would be decided by this battle, this war. Whether they could hold their heads high or be buried in the cemetery of their hopes and dreams, it would all be decided now.\n\"Today, we go to battle.\"\n\"HAI!\"\n\"Today, we'll brandish our blades toward the necks of our enemies.\"\n\"HAI!\"\n\"Today, we'll either shed blood or shed the blood of others.\"\n\"HAI!\"\n\"Follow me to those crimson fields! Give me the beating hearts from your chests! Lay down your lives for me!\"\n\"HAI! HAI! HAI!\"\nThe glow of White City grew to a fever pitch.. Then, inexplicably, the entire city disappeared.",

      "content": "\"It's time.\"\nIn Black City, preparations were underway as well. The only difference was that while City Lord White took sole leadership, Black City was headed by a father-son pair.\nJerach was stunned out of his thoughts when he heard his father's voice.\nThe two men looked practically like copies of one another. Jerach's father had the same bald held, black armor and jagged beard his son did. The only difference was that Jerach's father was a head taller than he was.\nObviously, since Jerach was already in his 30's, this wasn't a matter of youth. Rather, Jerach's father simply had a far larger stature.\n\"Get the men ready.\" Jerach's father continued. \"The city will be disappearing in just a few minutes.\"\n\"Yes, father.\"\nJerach nodded and went off to complete the last of his duties.\nJerach was lost in his thoughts as he made his way toward the military fields. Black City wouldn't be taking action immediately, so their mental state didn't need to be in a primed state. Not that Jerach was in the head space to give a motivational speech to begin with.\nHe had just failed the Brave City trials miserably and his heart was still being shadowed by a perpetual guilt.\nEven now, he could still remember Leonel's complete disregard of him.\nIf Leonel had ignored him, it would have been one thing. But, Jerach remembered making eye contact with Leonel just one time while they were both still on the first floor.\nBack then, it had been as though Leonel was looking at a stranger. He glanced at him as though he was observing someone he had seen for the first time and moved away from him just as easily\nThe way Leonel looked at him at that moment was something he would never forget…\nAt least if Leonel never looked in his direction, he could make himself believe that Leonel felt some anger toward him. Somehow, he felt that that would make him feel better. After all, anger was just another way of acknowledging someone's existence.\nBut, to so genuinely treat him as though they had never met before…\nAs the son and Heir to a City Lordship, he never thought he would ever have to deal with emotions like this, he never thought anything could make him feel this way, let alone due to someone he had met so recently.\nHowever, deep down, Jerach knew that his emotions were less about Leonel and more about letting down himself.\nJerach shook his head.\n'It doesn't matter anymore.'\n**\nBack on Camelot's moon, Leonel was still in a state of shock. He hadn't expected that the Zone quests had truly not been over, but he had expected even less that the 'reward' for completing them would be accelerating Earth into the Fourth Dimension.\nLeonel's expression changed.\nWithout waiting for anyone to react, he shot to Ameron's side and sent the strongest punch he could at the latter's chin.\nAmeron was completely flabbergasted by the change. He still didn't understand what was happening. All he knew was that he was bound now, and even if he wasn't, it would take him too much time to undo Leonel's restrictions. His last thought was that Leonel had tricked him and that he was basically a dead man.\nHis vision went black, collapsing to the ground.\nLancelot's eyes widened. \"What a –\"\nLancelot froze. \"Huh?\"\nAt that moment, Lancelot suddenly felt as though shackles that had held him down for decades suddenly imploded. Strength flooded into his body at impossible rates.\nIn the blink of an eye he was twice as powerful, then three times, then four times. Eventually, it got to be so much that even he no longer understood just how powerful he was in comparison to his former self.\nLeonel stumbled backward, the forcefulness of Lancelot's breakthrough being too great. The wind kicked up and even the several meter thick trees around them began to sway.\nLeonel put a forearm over his eyes, trying to peak through to see what was happening. But, he soon realized that it wasn't just Lancelot.\nAt that moment, dozens, even hundreds of knights they had brought with them were experiencing similar power boosts.\nLeonel looked down at Ameron's unconscious body and suddenly felt a bit bad. The reason he had taken him down like that was because if Camelot entered the Fourth Dimension, the restrictions on Ameron's strength would have been completely lifted. By then, he would have been too troublesome to deal with.\nLeonel sent an apologetic gaze toward the other three hidden family members.? But, considering the fear in their eyes and they way they were trying to distance themselves, Leonel felt that his smile might not have been as kind as he thought.\nAina smiled lightly at Leonel's embarrassed expression. But, truthfully, Leonel made the right move in such a situation. The worst case scenario was definitely a terrible situation they didn't want to be in.\n'This makes sense, though. They've been stuck at the peak of the Third Dimension for so long, it's only right they breakthrough. It's likely related to their unique magic system, too…'\n\"Aina.\"\n\"Hm?\" Aina blinked, a slight blush coloring her cheeks.\nLeonel couldn't help but smile when he saw this. She was still so shy, all he did was call her name.\nAina currently found it troublesome to even look at Leonel. Every time she did, she would remember what happened before…\nShe furiously shook her head, looking away.\nLeonel began to ask the question he was planning to, but Lancelot's sudden burst of laughter shocked him out of his train of thought.\nLancelot spread out his arms as though trying to catch the rays of the sun falling through the heavy canopies above. For the first time in months, the heavy rain of Camelot finally came to a stop, allowing the clouds to separate.\nAs a warrior, Lancelot had spent his whole life training. He never thought there would be a day where he could finally break through the final barrier, but here that day was. He felt better than he ever had before.\nTo an outside observer, he had simply broken through. But to him, it felt as though he had seen the light at the end of a dark tunnel. He hadn't thought that a simple shift in his mindset would bring him such benefits.\n\"Leonel, thank you!\"\nLeonel opened his mouth to respond again, but it seemed as though the universe had something against him today. But, this time, the cause of the interruption was far more serious. It was serious to the point where it just might decide the life and death of Earth as a world.\nThe sound of shattering glass reverberated throughout. Whether you were on Camelot, on the Moon, or on Earth, everyone heard it. It felt as though the fabric of time and space itself was quaking, threatening to tear itself apart.\nLeonel looked up through the dense foliage, barely catching a glimpse of a sight he would never forget in his life.\nA city had appeared in the sky. And, this city was falling toward them.\nAt the top of this city's gates, a lone woman dressed in black robes accented by white soft armor stood, a massive hammer in her hand as she looked down toward the rapidly approaching Camelot.\nA bloodthirsty aura soon enveloped their lands. Those faint of heart felt as though there simply wasn't enough air to breathe.\nTerrain was invading.",

      "content": "Leonel's eyes widened. Everything suddenly clicked at once.\nHowever, there was simply no time to harp on it.\n\"Run!\" Leonel roared.\nThe impact of such a massive object hitting the ground from such a height would be enormous. A meteor of 100 kilometers across would be enough to annihilate all life on Earth. Even though this city was only 10 kilometers across and its velocity was much slower in comparison to a meteor, Leonel was absolutely certain that its hardness was far beyond anything a normal meteor could compare with. If this wasn't the case, how would they dare to stay within its walls as they fell from the skies? Plus, this wasn't Earth! It was a small moon!\nLeonel wasn't sure how his calculations would change in a true Fourth Dimensional world like this one, but he didn't have the mental space to spare.\nWithout hesitation, Leonel grasped at Aina's hand and charged out. But, he soon realized that despite his speed, Aina actually had no problem keeping up with him. In fact, she was the one dragging him forward.\n'[Swiftness], [Second Wind], [Breath of Wings] –'\nLeonel cast as many wind speed spells as he could in quick succession. His affinity for the Wind Element wasn't very high, so the expenditure of his Soul Force was several levels more. But, this wasn't a situation where he had the mind to care about such things.\nThe Knights around Leonel and Aina were a second later in reacting, but they too shot forward trusting in Leonel's judgment.\nWith their speed, even covering a few hundred meters wouldn't be impossible by the time the city hit the ground. In this situation, every extra foot they could gain was an extra chance at living.\nLeonel's Soul Force continued to surge. He never realized it before, but it seemed that shackles on his own body were loosening greatly as well. His mind felt freer than it ever had before.\nLeonel let Aina pull him along, his mind entirely focused on his spell. He dug deep, a violent wind kicking up around him.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\n'Don't worry about me Little Blackstar! Stay in the air and in your incorporeal state! Don't come down here, we'll be fine!'\nThe little mink skipped through the air, steps of black fog forming before it. But, a clearly distressed expression was on his little face.\nThough the little guy couldn't understand what was happening, he had a deep enough connection with Leonel to know that something bad was coming.\nThe more panicked the knights saw Leonel feel, the more panicked they also seemed to become. The most troublesome part about it all was that they were in a forest, constantly having to dodge around trees and branches. The terrain made them slow down by several factors more than they would have in practically any other landscape.\nWithout time to care for anything else, they had even gone as far as to abandon the prisoners they had already captured, allowing them to run on their own.\nAt that moment, the city falling from the skies was already within half a kilometer of the ground. Just the wind pressure of its descent was enough to give Leonel an even stronger tailwind than previously, allowing his spell formation to speed up by several levels.\n\"Brace yourselves!\" Leonel roared.\nLeonel pulled back on Aina's hand, stunning her for a moment. All of her forward momentum stalled in that instant. But, Leonel didn't give her time to say anything else.\nWith one swift motion, he grabbed onto her slender waist and sent the large curved package on her back and the great sword in her hand into the Segmented Cube.\nInstead of continuing forward, Leonel launched himself into the air, cradling Aina's body close to his own.\nLeonel's body seemed enveloped by a blinding light in that moment. Those who could only catch a faint glimpse would swear that they had laid eyes on a soaring bird.\nHe leapt from tree branch to tree branch, shooting past a hundred meters into the air in what felt like the blink of an eye.\nThe instant Leonel reached the tallest canopy, his gaze sharpened, all the strength he could muster bowing his legs and causing his thighs to explosively increase a fold in size.\n\"HA!\"\nLeonel flooded Force into his legs and launched himself toward the clouds.\nAs though he was a bullet, he left a streak of golden light in his wake, a violent cyclone of wind shattering the tree he had used as a springboard.\nIn the distance, the city reached within a hundred meters of the ground. The wind pressure alone flatted the forest beneath it, uprooting trees and sending them flying in every direction.\nSHUUUUUUUUUUUUUU! BANG!\nThe city suddenly came to a sudden grinding halt. Unlike what Leonel had expected, it never physically touched the ground. However, the damage….\nIt was one of the most basic laws of physics. For every action, there was an equal and opposite reaction.\nA city falling from the skies like a meteor, weighing an impossibly great amount, suddenly coming to a stop like that wouldn't magically make everything better.\nThe world seemed to fall silent for a moment until the ground suddenly registered just the level of force it was about to withstand.\nThe earth exploded, surging like a tide along with strong winds to all sides.\nIf trees were uprooted before, now, even ancient trees that dug hundreds of meters into the ground were blasted away.\nThe soil, the rock, the greenery, it was all uprooted spreading out as though using the floating city as the epicenter of disaster.\nThe tsunami of earth seemed to gain speed the further it spread, its momentum increasing and rolling over endlessly.\nAt this moment, Leonel had reached his apex, just barely 500 meters above the surface. Seeing what was happening below him, his jaw clenched. He wasn't sure if the others could survive, but at the moment, he didn't have time to worry about them. Even he wasn't safe just yet.\nVeins bulged out from Leonel's forehead, his strain reaching a new level.\n\"[FLOAT]!\"",

      "content": "Using a spell you had no affinity with took an obscene amount of Spirit Pressure. Sometimes, when the Mage Academy of Camelot gained a child of rare affinity, they would have no choice but to give them a teacher who might very well not have any talent in the child's field.\nIn such a case, the teacher would do their best to guide the child in the fundamentals. But, even in that case, the strongest spells the teacher might cast would be Apprentice level Arts.\nHowever… [Float] wasn't an Apprentice level Art. In fact, it was well known as one of the most difficult to cast Magus Arts in all of Camelot.\nNot only was Leonel casting a Three Star Magus Art he had no affinity with, but he was also using it in a situation he had no business using it in.\n[Float] was only meant to help one hover ten meters above the ground at most. And even then, every second one spent at that height would cost a huge expenditure of Spirit Pressure even for a high affinity wind mage.\nYet, Leonel not only had no wind affinity, but he was over 500 meters in the sky!\nWind Mages would often use [Float] like an Earth Mage would use a defensive technique. It was only a method of protecting themselves in battle for a short period of time. Every extra meter they soared into the air, the exponentially more Spirit Pressure they would need to use.\n\"Send me inside!\" Aina suddenly said.\nShe hadn't spoken a word since Leonel pressed her against his chest like this. She didn't want to admit it to herself, but she found it to be quite comfortable. But, her comfort wasn't worth Leonel strain.\nThe fact that Leonel had sent her box and sword in was enough to show that every extra pound was a huge strain to him.\nOf course, it wasn't that Leonel wouldn't rather send Aina in, but rather that sending in a living object compared to an inanimate one was a completely different concept. For the same reason Leonel had to knock Aliard out first before stuffing him into a snowglobe, he couldn't casually send Aina wherever he wanted whenever he wanted.\nIn that split second, it was better for him to take this action than explaining his plan. Who knew what might happen? If he told Aina not to resist and that he'd be fine, who knew if she'd believe him?\nJust when Leonel was about to answer Aina and agree to her suggestion, veins bulging across his forehead, it hit them.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\n'Do as I said!' Leonel roared in his mind.\nBANG!\nIt was just the surge of wind finally reaching them. It was far weaker than what it was on the ground. Yet… it felt as though they had been smashed by a sledgehammer.\nLeonel wrapped his arms around Aina tightly.\nHe could feel bits and pieces of rocks and chipped wood rebounding across his back, trying to tear his skin apart.\n\"Leonel!\" Aina cried out.\nLeonel grinned. In all his life, this was only the second time he could remember Aina calling out his name.\n\"Don't worry, I have thick skin.\"\nLeonel sent his voice to Aina's ears. If not for this, it was doubtful that she would be able to hear him at all.\nAina didn't seem comforted by these words at all, but there was nothing she could do. If she tried to force her way out of Leonel's protection, it would only make everything worse.\nThere was no time where Leonel wanted to use his shuttle more, but he knew it would be useless to do so here.\nThe shuttle provided too little control. It was great at straight-line speed, but Leonel had just been in a forest. By the time he managed to make it above the foliage, it was already too late to guarantee making it out of the range of the shockwave.\nIf the shuttle got hit by the shockwave, Leonel was certain it would be able to hold up against the elements alone, but he would have no control of it. According to his simulations, the likelihood of it crashing into the ground was near 100%. In that case, it was far better to rely on his own body which he had far more control of.\nAnd, even though the surfboard form of the shuttle gave greater nimbleness, it provided no protection whatsoever. If Leonel brought it out now, it would be more likely to just get lost in all the chaos instead of helping them escape.\n'I'll definitely modify that damn thing!' Leonel roared in his heart as he tumbled through the air like loose trash.\nEvery time it seemed that Leonel might be headed toward the ground, he would grit his teeth and activate [Float] in full force again, slowing his descent. It was exactly this level of control he wouldn't have in the shuttle.\nSlowly but surely, the tsunami of earth and walls of wind began to calm.\nAccording to Leonel calculations, they had been blown over two kilometers away from their original location, and this was after going half a kilometer into the skies. Leonel couldn't even imagine the devastation on the ground.\nSeeing that it was calm enough, Leonel slowly opened his eyes.\nThe surroundings were filled with a dense fog of dirt and soil, it was the kind of air one couldn't breathe in too deeply.\nLeonel summoned the shuttle and entered the surfboard mode, instantly stopping his descent to the ground.\nHe slowly rose, trying to get to a point where his vision was clear of this mushroom cloud of earth.\nWhen he finally did, he was already over a kilometer above the surface and what he saw left him stunned.\nDevastation. Absolute devastation.\nWhere there once was an endless forest of greenery, there was nothing but overturned earth. The land had become a slosh of broken trees, sand, soil and rock.\nLeonel couldn't even begin to imagine the devastation this had caused to the wildlife and he was even more worried about what happened to Lancelot and the others.\nAina looked down from her position in Leonel's arms, her heart also trembling.\nThey both locked eyes onto the floating city in the distance.\nAt that moment, White City finally completed its descent, perfectly fitting into the hole in the ground it had created.\nSeeing such a scene, Leonel shuddered.\nWhat was the most difficult part about invading another world? Wasn't it gaining a foothold…?\nBut, what if you came with your own foothold? What if you brought your own fortified city to launch your attacks from?",

      "content": "Leonel took a deep breath.\nAt the moment, they were about twenty or so kilometers from Camelot's main city. But, between here and there, there were two Baronies and several smaller settlements. Who knew how many of them were affected by this earthen tsunami?\n'Though it benefits them to bring a city along, they definitely faced complications themselves.'\nThere were many benefits to wiping out all the land around them like this, the main of which was the fact this fallen city didn't have to worry about attacks in the immediate future while also wiping out any potential nearby settlements Camelot might have had.\nBut, this method was a double-edged sword. While White City now couldn't be easily attacked, they also couldn't easily launch any attacks either. Marching an army through this mess would be a nightmare.\nIt made Leonel feel like this was a purposeful choice.\nLeonel felt that there was an over 98% chance that their current attackers were the City Lords of Terrain. The information he had access to put him in a unique position where he likely knew more about their current enemies than anyone of The Empire or the Slayer Legion did.\nThis perspective allowed him to understand that this wasn't a quick invasion plan.\nIf Leonel put himself in the shoes of those City Lords, their goal wasn't just to conquer Earth, it was to make Earth their new home.\nThe reason for this could be summarized in a single sentence: Earth had more potential than Terrain.\nAs for why they waited until now, that was even more straight forward. There was no coincidence they waited for the exact instant Earth evolved into the Fourth Dimension.\nAnd, unfortunately, due to Camelot's appearance, this happened long before Earth had fully settled itself. Leonel's actions had inadvertently placed Earth in a bad position.\nLeonel felt somewhat complicated.\nOn the one hand, he felt that Earth was no longer truly a home to him anymore. But, on the other… He felt a twisting pain in his chest watching it being invaded this way.\nLeonel descended from the skies, riding his jet-black surfboard back into the dense cloud of kicked up dirt and soil.\n\"Bear with it for a bit.\" Leonel spoke softly to Aina. \"I want to see if I can find any of the others.\"\nAina wanted to say something like 'You can let me go now', but sensing Leonel's downcast mood, she remained silent, resting her ear against his chest.\nLeonel touched down to the ground, his brows furrowing.\n'This will be difficult, but it's still worth a try.'\n\"[Repulse].\"\nA sphere of wind twirled around Leonel and suddenly expanded violently. In the blink of an eye, it cleared the heavy atmosphere.\n[Repulse] was a Three Star Mage Art usually used as an area control sphere to push enemies away. So, it was quite effective in its task.\nLeonel took a deep breath in the cleared air, closing his eyes and planting his two feet firmly in what ground he could find. In fact, he sunk in ankle deep into the rolling dirt and rocks.\n\"[Seismic Wave].\"\nA strong surge of Spirit Pressure shot out from Leonel. If one looked closely, it was possible to see small ripples in the loose earth beneath his feet.\nThere were many sensory specific spells within Camelot's magic system. They not only existed within the auxiliary types, but they also existed within the Elemental types as well. Wind Elemental and Earth Elemental spells especially had many of them for obvious reasons.\n[Seismic Wave] was a Three Star Magus Art used for scouting with the Earth Element. It worked almost like echo location, except with sensing changes in the earth rather than with sound.\nSeveral small waves were sent out that were practically imperceptible to the eye. On solid ground, there would be no visual cues at all. But, in loose ground like this, it showed up similar to the way a pond would ripple after experiencing a thrown stone.\nEverything within several kilometers was suddenly fed back to Leonel.\nThere were very few limitations to [Seismic Wave]. It took very little energy to send a wave out, the only real limitation was how sharp the senses of the person sending them out was.\nIt was said that certain animals could sense the coming of an earthquake days in advance. Such small changes could be detected by mere beasts of the Third Dimension… So what about Leonel?\nEven after reaching out ten kilometers, Leonel still didn't feel like he had reached his limit. He had even crossed the barrier of the city in the distance. But, he shook his head and focused again.\nInstead of distance, he focused on depth.\nThis required stronger waves and a bit more Earth Elemental Force, but it was still within Leonel's ability even though his previous uses of [Float] had almost burnt him out. Simply put, thanks to his Three Star Constitution, Leonel's recovery of Soul Force was unmatched.\nLeonel's breath suddenly hitched and his heart grew heavy.\nHe had found his first dead body.\nHis heart clenched, his hold on Aina involuntarily becoming tighter.\nHe found another. Then another.\nMany of them were crushed beneath the weight of the heavy earth. Some unlucky ones were struck by heavy flying stones and trees, causing damage they couldn't live through. Some others were pierced through by errant sharp branches.\nLeonel continued to search, going deeper and deeper. But, somewhere deep inside, he realized that the deeper he went, the less likely he was to find someone he could save.\n'There! There!'\nLeonel almost cried out.\nLeonel found one beating heart, then another. His breathing grew quicker. This was good, some had survived. This was definitely good. As long as he helped them climb back out, their lives should be saved.\nUnfortunately, Leonel was a bit too na?ve.\nOne of the most important aspects of war was the element of surprise. Keeping one's enemies on their toes, catching them unawares, and gaining victories for the smallest price in exchange… These were the staples of good generals.\nSince Terrain's City Lords had planned this matter for so long, how could they be unable to predict what would happen to the landscape around them? And how could they allow that landscape to force them to give up their advantage?\nThe sharp call of several beasts shook Leonel out of his focused state.\nHis head tilted up into the skies, peering through the dense cloud of dirt only to barely make out a sight that made his heart tremble.\nBirds. Hundreds of them. Each one with a wingspan of no less than five meters while some of the largest were over twenty meters in width.\nOn their backs, each had two warriors. One was outfitted with a polearm weapon while the other manned a massive cross bow machine strapped to the backs of these massive birds of prey.\nWhite City was already attacking and their first wave would be an aerial assault.",

      "content": "Leonel was instantly at a loss.\nIf he continued saving those buried beneath the rubble, many of whom were unconscious, he would be allowing this attack to continue on smoothly. But, if he moved to stop them now, it was very likely that many of those he could save would die.\n'Dammit!' Leonel roared in his mind.\n\"Leonel.\"\n\"Huh?\" Leonel snapped out of his own thoughts.\n\"Just point out where they are to me and I'll dig them out. I can't battle in the skies like you can.\"\nLeonel opened his mouth to reply but wasn't exactly sure what to say.\nIt would definitely be more efficient for them to be saved by him. He could use his Earth Elemental affinity to simply carry them out. But, Aina would have to physically dig them out.\n\"Just leave it to me.\" Aina insisted. \"More people will die than those buried down if they're allowed to go.\"\nLeonel's hesitation was broken when he heard these words. She was right. If they managed to make it to one of the Baronies, hundreds would die.\n\"I…\"\nAina pushed off, breaking out of Leonel's embrace and landing on the ground.\n\"They can't see me on the ground through all the dirt clouds. Stop worrying about me.\"\nLeonel blinked and nodded.\n\"The first is 57 meters in that direction and 13 meters underground.\"\nWith that, Leonel shot into the skies.\n…\nThe formation of predatory birds soared through the skies in perfect formation. They were split into groups of eleven. Each group of eleven was split into three groups.\nThe first group formed the outer structure of the formation. At the helm, there was one bird and following its wings there were three birds to each side for a total of seven forming this outer structure.\nThis first group formed an inverted 'V' structure.\nThe second group was likewise in a 'V' structure, but they were tucked within the larger outer structure. This inner structure was formed of smaller, swifter birds and there were just three of them.\nThe final 'group' was actually just a single bird. This bird protected the commander to the back of this double inverted 'V' structure.\nIn the end, from afar, it looked as though numerous triangular formations were flying through the air. They looked no different from jets shooting through the skies, all of them exuding a Fourth Dimensional aura.\nThis sort of formation should have been far beyond Leonel's means to deal with. The only reason Aina didn't stop him wasn't because she wasn't worried, but rather because she knew that trying to stop Leonel would have been useless. He was simply too fond of doing stupid things to save people he didn't even know, let alone the fact he was now doing so to protect those he thought of as his friends.\nIn Leonel's mind, Mordred was now a close friend of his. If Camelot fell, it would be Mordred's family that suffered the most. How could he allow such a thing to happen?\nAt the center of these numerous smaller formations, a man wearing black robes accented by white flexible armor stood atop a predator bird of his own. Unlike the others, he was the only one on the back of this bird.\nHe stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his hair shaved down until only the smallest bristles remained.\nThe rushing winds whipped against his face, but it was as though his skin was tightly stapled to his skeleton. His stern expression never distorted, nor did his eyes ever blink.\nHe was one of City Lord White's White Knights, Khaled Diore.\n…\nLeonel stood in the skies, a simple [Light Refraction] array centered around him. The more he observed the coming tide of predatory birds, the more he realized he didn't stand a chance.\nEven ignoring the warriors and assault weapons on their backs, just the beasts alone were beyond anything Leonel had ever seen before.\nThey had beaks that glistened like the blades of a polished spear. Their black feathers caused the light of the setting sun to rebound as though they were metal plates. Their eyes were a bright shade of crimson that exuded a bloodthirsty light as though all they knew was slaughter.\nAs though this wasn't enough, Leonel felt that the large crossbows fitted to their backs contained much more power than 23rd century canons. By his estimations, they were weaker than 25th century technology, but marginally stronger than 24th. And, unlike Earth's technology, they weren't negatively influenced by Force in the slightest.\nNone of this even began to touch upon the humans that managed to command these beasts and control these machines. Leonel was simply in over his head.\nHe was still within the Third Dimension and he was just a single person facing almost 500. Any smart person would turn tail and run.\nLeonel took several deep breaths, trying to calm his beating heart.\nFor a moment, he closed off his senses. He heard nothing, saw nothing, felt nothing.\nEarth was probably in chaos at this moment. Leonel could almost feel it.\nEveryone's lives had already been turned upside down once, but here it was again.\nBut, he was lucky. He had talent. If he wanted to and had the time, he could gain the strength to protect himself, but not everyone could claim this.\nDid Leonel feel some sort of responsibility because of this?\nHe would be lying if he said no. But, somewhere inside, he felt it was more than this.\nIt was the same feeling he got on the football field, the same feeling he felt when he sat down at an exam, the same feeling he had when he stepped onto his first battlefield.\nLeonel opened his eyes, a mad grin spreading across his face as his irises flickered a wild violet-red.\nLeonel flipped his palm, causing a familiar black rhino's horn to appear.\nHe brought it slowly to his lips, his blood boiling and his skin flushing crimson as bronze runes danced across it.\n'That's a nice formation you have there, would be a shame if someone ruined it.'\nThese birds might seem mighty and menacing, but these were exactly the kind of beasts most susceptible to outside influences.\nSeeing such odds before him only made Leonel want to win even more.\nIt was exactly then Leonel blew on the horn with all his might, pouring his Spirit Pressure into it.\nThe people of Terrain had pissed him off many times already. Leonel even believed that the so-called 'fugitives' they had bribed Shield Cross Stars into looking for were those who wanted to blow the whistle on this maddening plan of theirs.\nUnfortunately, before those fugitives could do much of anything, Earth's evolution was accelerated, causing them to enter the Fourth Dimension before anyone predicted.\nLeonel remembered how he had been treated just because he was weak. He remembered how Jerach refused to tell him what they were hiding even after he spared his life. He saw the way they tried to humiliate Aina -- his Aina.\nSince they wanted war, he would give it to them.",

      "content": "The blaring sound of a horn tore across the skies.\nThe perfect formation of predator birds was instantly shaken. Their riders, which had spent years learning how to tame these wild beasts, were suddenly at a loss. It felt as though they were riding bucking bulls.\nWhite Knight Diore's gaze sharpened. Despite the while reaction of his predatory bird was equally as wild, his feet remained attached as though they had been sown together.\n'This noise.'\nKhaled locked onto a particular direction. Even though his eyes saw nothing in that spot, he trusted his senses. There was most definitely an enemy right there.\nLeonel felt the White Knight's aura lock onto him. The feeling was like being gripped by the hands of death.\nHe knew from the very beginning that [Light Refraction] wasn't infallible. But, it only made it worse now that he was funneling the abilities of this horn right toward the flock of birds. Even if the sight of him didn't give him away, the direction in which the blaring horn was coming from most definitely did.\nBut, Leonel didn't stop blowing. From behind his [Light Refraction] spell, he locked eyes with Khaled, his blood boiling.\nThe White Knight stomped down hard on his predator bird, sending a violent shock through its body and waking it up.\nBy now, the perfect formation had devolved into a wild flock of birds flying in every which direction. In fact, out of their control, many on the backs of these predator birds fell from their backs.\nWithout a choice, they pulled out an inconspicuous short pole from their harnesses. With a few clicks, they became gliders.\nWatching so many fall from the skies, Leonel sighed a breath of relief, thinking they would have no choice but to return to White City. But, to his astonishment, as though they were assigned a life and death mission, these gliders continued forward toward their original destinations, not gazing back toward White City even once.\nLeonel's heart froze over. This was the first time he truly felt the resolve of these warriors.\n'Dammit.'\nLeonel put his horn away and pulled out his black bow and slipped on his bowman gloves.\nIt was a palpable pressure, it was the kind Leonel hadn't felt before. In all his life, he had never faced such dauntless, fearless warriors.\nThe demons loved war, but they still feared death. They still stormed the battlefields, but they weren't a single unit, forged together by blood and sweat.\nThese warriors were different, though.\nIt was impossible for them to have guessed that someone would be able to disrupt their plan before it even truly began. Yet, they reacted as though it didn't matter.\nDespite the fact they hadn't sensed Leonel's location like their captain had, they still traveled toward him dauntlessly, not a single one of them cowering in fear.\nLeonel felt like he was back on those French battlefields, facing those mortal men who threw their life away to protect their country in the face of an enemy they knew was impossible to defeat. It was on that battlefield Leonel gained respect for bravery and death…\nLeonel nocked his first arrow, his aura surging.\n'Little Blackstar.'\nThe little mink popped into existence out of a spinning black vortex, landing atop Leonel's head as though he had never left.\nLeonel's body was coated in a thin film of dancing shadows, his goldish bronze hair dancing wildly beneath his towering Force.\nCrackling lightning, sharpening winds, dancing shadows that sounded like blades gliding across his arrow…\nLeonel took a deep breath and released his fingers on his exhale. As though his bow was a living entity extending from his own body, it followed his will, drawing a line from his eyes to his target.\nPCHU!\nWithout ability to dodge, the first glider was pierced through the skull, but the others continued flying forward as though they hadn't sensed a thing.\nLeonel brought out a second arrow and fired again. Then a third. Then a fourth.\nIn the blink of an eye, he had already sent out over a dozen arrows and reaped a dozen lives.\nHowever, he could see it all clearly. His senses were impossibly sharp, how could he miss it?\nNot a single one who lived flinched, not a single one thought of turning back, not a single one cowered.\nThere were simply too many. There had only been around 500 predator birds, but each had two riders, making the gliders in the sky total over a thousand.\nAgainst a normal army, killing so many without giving them ability to retaliate would have caused them to stagger and run. But, this army didn't seem to function by normal standards.\nAnd how could they? This wasn't a land they had come to conquer for mere wealth, this was about their lives, their future. To their backs wasn't a mere city, it was one filled with their family, their friends, those they had to protect.\nThis wasn't a normal invading army and the White Troops of White City weren't a normal group of men and women.\nLeonel clenched his jaw.\nThese were all Fourth Dimensional warriors. The only reason he could killed them was because in their current positions, they had no ability to fight back. But, if he didn't put all of his strength into one arrow, he knew it would still be impossible to kill them even in this situation.\nHe simply didn't have any large area of effect spells he could use to deal with them all at once. And, even if he did, he wouldn't have enough Spirit Pressure to easily affect such a large area without all but killing himself.\nAs though the situation wasn't bad enough already, it only got worse in the next instant.\nWhite Knight Diore had locked onto Leonel's general location long ago. Yet, despite knowing his men were dying one after another, he still hadn't made a move against Leonel… And the reason for this soon became clear…\n\"Quell your rage.\"\nA booming voice shocked the wild flock of predator birds.\nLeonel's heart trembled.\nThe birds…\nIt seemed that White Knight Diore wasn't designated as the head of this aerial squad without reason.\nThe disordered, wild flock of predator birds suddenly regained their purpose, their crimson eyes all locking onto a certain direction.\nLeonel's blood ran cold.",

      "content": "The feeling of hundreds locking onto you, each without any other expressed goal than to taste your blood and reap your life… It was something Leonel had experienced before within the Merlin trials.\nBut, there was something different about facing so many beasts. They didn't have a semblance of humanity, not an ounce of reason. There were no words he could use to get them to pause, nor were there any looming timers or rules he could use to pull himself out of this situation.\nIt couldn't have been a more primal sense of fight or flight. It was either he defeated all of these enemies or escaped them, if not… he would die.\nLeonel suddenly felt a wave of interference play against his [Light Refraction] spell, distorting it. In the blink of an eye, it became a useless decoy hanging in the skies, exposing him to the senses of thousands.\nA shudder ran through Leonel's spine.\nThis hadn't happened because he was careless or even because he had run out of energy. This was an ability.\n'The birds…!'\nAll this time Leonel had had the thought of being careful at the back of his mind. Though it was somewhat more difficult for a unit of warriors to use their abilities as freely in such a structure where the power of the whole was more important than the individual, Leonel knew that unexpected abilities were one of the things he had to pay attention to the most.\nIn this aspect, Leonel was perfectly correct. The actions of White Knight Diore proved as much without a shadow of a doubt.\nWhat Leonel didn't expect, however, was for the abilities of the predator birds to be maybe even more important.\nAll this time, Leonel had been so focused on their menacing exteriors that he never considered the fact their internal abilities were what truly should have struck fear in him.\nLeonel rapidly retreated, placing his body almost parallel to the ground as his jet-black surfboard sent him soaring backward.\nHe quickly pulled out the dictionary, using the base of the surfboard to hide his actions.\n\"Those birds, what are they and what are their abilities?\"\n[*Ping*]\n[Replying to Seed, these birds are a sub-species of specially bred Decoder Beasts known as the Jagged Beak Predator Ravens. They are known for two main abilities, one related to their oddly shaped beaks and the second related to their pupils.]\n[Jagged Beak: Ability to disrupt Force organization]\n[Predator Pupils: Ability to disrupt Force organization]\nLeonel's heart trembled.\nThe drawing of Force Arts was a delicate operation. Every Force Art type was a different language that spoke in a different way. But, in order to convey a certain message, it had to be exceptionally particular. This much was proved by when Leonel modified Camelot's Force Art in order to draw them faster. Doing just this small action caused the strength of these Force Arts to plummet.\nThis was all to say something very simple. If these Predator Ravens could disrupt the organization of Force Arts… then spells were all but useless against them!\nLeonel now understood why it was that these birds were sent as the centerpiece of the first attack. Any large scale formations Camelot wanted to put up to protect themselves would be absolutely useless before them.\nEven though the Predator Pupils were weaker than their Jagged Beaks in formation breaking, when 500 of them stared at a single point, what chance did a formation stand? And, beyond that, what if they began attacking that already weakened point with their beaks?!\nKKKWWAAAAAA!! KWWWWAAAAAAA!!\nLeonel's expression changed. His Internal Sight swept out, only to find that the distance between him and the flock of Predator Ravens had already halved. Their speed was inconceivable and clearly far beyond what his surfboard could muster. Maybe if it wasn't for the heavy crossbows still strapped to their backs, they would be even faster!\nLeonel locked eyes with the commander in the midst. He still stood tall, his hands clasped behind his back and his black robes fluttering wildly beneath the speed of his Predator Raven.\nIn truth, White Knight Diore was inwardly surprised despite his indifferent expression.\nFor one, he recognized Leonel. They would be foolish to not know of the talents of Earth before coming to invade them, but even beyond that, even if it wasn't about invading Earth, he would have heard of Leonel. After all, the rumors of him joining Valiant Heart Mountain without having to pass the trials had already spread like wildfire.\nBut, this was only a secondary reasoning. What shocked him the most was that despite 500 Predator Ravens locking onto Leonel at once, all they managed to do was distort Leonel spell. Had it not been for Leonel dispelling the Mage Art himself, Khaled might still be looking toward a distorted image of Leonel.\nThe White Knight narrowed his eyes.\nThis was good. Now that Earth had evolved into a Fourth Dimensional world, those who were born within it should be experiencing a evolutionary growing phase right now. Within the next few weeks to months, many of Earth's greatest talents would experience explosive growth in their abilities.\nThis was why it was so important for them to be swift in their approach. This wasn't only about keeping the element of surprise, but it was also about ensuring that Earth didn't get any more chances to grow.\nEarth didn't have the foundation of cultivation. All they could rely on was technology and their gifted abilities. The evolution to the Fourth Dimension would already guarantee the near uselessness of technology, so they only had the latter to worry about.\nWith a talent like Leonel before him, how could Khaled possibly allow him to live? Leonel was most definitely one of the greatest roadblocks standing between them and claiming this world for themselves.\nHow fair was it for Earth to have so much potential and for Terrain to have reached the end of its own? How fair was it for them to have to scratch and claw for everything while the people of Earth could be gifted the world? How fair was it for them to have to deal with people of their own world that would rather be the dogs of others rather than forging something for themselves?\nThe truth was that there was no fairness in the world. Since that was the case, they would snatch what should be theirs themselves.\nAnd in White Knight Diore's mind, killing Leonel was the first step.\n\"Swarm him to death.\"",

      "content": "Leonel's feet shifted, slowing his black surfboard to a grinding halt. He pulled out the horn once again, but Khaled only sneered.\nSeeing his reaction, Leonel put the horn away without even blowing on it. Now that he understood the situation he was in, his mind flowed like water, jumping from idea to idea without pause or rest.\nIt was already impossible for him to stop the gliders, but he had at least bought the Baronies and Camelot time. By now, information about what was happening here should have long since been disseminated. A city falling from the sky was not something that could be missed and Leonel had made certain of that.\nLeonel's goal had already changed.\nAssuming that he would be able to stop an entire army by himself had been foolish. Since he knew that he couldn't, he would focus on what he could do.\nHis first priority was to survive. His second priority would be to kill this commander.\nThough Leonel set this second priority, he didn't spend any of his time hoping for it. He could sense that this commander was much stronger than he was.\nAt his current level, Leonel couldn't even deal with the likes of Jilniya and those Heirs of Powers with any sort of assurance. At most, he could deal with exceptionally weak Fourth Dimensional existences and those who couldn't defend themselves like those gliders.\nBut, against someone like White Knight Diore… well, it was safe to say that if this battle was happening on the ground and not the air where Khaled could not directly track down and kill Leonel himself, Leonel would likely already be dead.\nLeonel's emotions seemed to vanish, his cold, calculating eyes locking onto the flock of birds around him as though he could no longer sense the gliders flying by below him. His mind reached an unprecedented sense of calm and seriousness that made the White Knight frown for the first time since this battle began.\nLeonel stood absolutely still in the air. Using his flying treasure as his base, he nocked another arrow, his breathing calm and steady.\nThe way his eyes locked onto White Knight Diore made the latter feel as though their was nothing else around them, as though in this world there were only the two of them, as though if he made the slightest mistake, miscalculated just the smallest bit… that his life would be over.\nA halo of bronze appeared above Leonel's head, wafting out a majestic violet fog. It seemed to coat Leonel in the air of a King, even causing the atmosphere to become several times heavier.\nIn the past, the gravity field ability of Leonel's Metal Synergy Lineage Factor had been exceptionally weak, barely increasing the gravity by a few percentage points, if that. But, after absorbing so much Urbe Essence, just the presence of Leonel's halo alone increased it by 20%, giving a 1.2x effect at no expense to Leonel's own stamina.\nThis might not seem like much, but aerial beasts were especially reliant on their light weight. Small changes could cost them a drastic amount of speed. And, at this moment, Leonel would take whatever advantage he could get.\nSHUUUU!\nA Predator Raven swooped down at Leonel, its eyes a furious shade of crimson. But, almost in the exact instant it reached the range in order to do this, Leonel had reacted first, letting loose an arrow.\nKWWWAAAA!! KWWWAAA!!\nAn arc of blood sprayed from the Predator Raven's eyes. It sprawled in the air, its wings flapping about so wildly that it lost several feathers in a matter of moments.\nLeonel's surfboard moved at his command. He seemed to move in a straight line, but the angles he took were just out of reach of several Predator Ravens.\nWithout any long ranged attacks, these Ravens could only assault Leonel with their beaks and their claws. Their pupils were also useless if Leonel wasn't casting any spells.\nThough they could disrupt the organization of Force, that was all. They couldn't dispel Force or negate it. This meant that against Force Arts, their abilities were exceptional. But, against normal Force attacks like Leonel's reinforced Arrows, the amount of change they could cause was next to zero.\nTo make matters worse for the flock of Predator Ravens, their size was simply too big. With only short ranged attacks available to them and even the smallest of them having a wingspan of five meters, nimble movements were most definitely not their forte. In fact, even if it was, with how many of them had swarmed Leonel, sudden bursts of movement would cause more problems to themselves than they would to Leonel himself.\nKhaled narrowed his eyes.\nHe thought that since he was facing a child, all he had to do was intimidate Leonel into making a stupid mistake with the use of his overwhelming numbers. He thought that Leonel wouldn't have the presence of mind to realize that he was keeping the Predator Ravens spaced out so that they wouldn't collide with one another.\nYet, not only had Leonel realized this, he realized it immediately and even boldly acted upon it even to the point of allowing the flock of Ravens to surround him.\nIf things kept going like this, without the room to even turn around, they would end up flying by Leonel and ironically letting him escape.\nBut, Khaled wasn't a fool. In fact, he was one of City Lord White's most trusted White Knights. If not for this, how could he be allowed to man one of their most important missions?\n\"Disperse.\" He commanded calmly.\nIn one swift motion, the Predator Ravens that had already passed Leonel by flapped their wings and spread out. Instantly, they had formed a large encirclement of Leonel, effectively cutting off the surrounding 500 meter space for their battlefield.\nThose Ravens that were still surging toward Leonel spread their wings out wide, coming to grinding halts as they either shot up or down.\nDespite feeling that he could kill Leonel with a single strike if he got the opportunity, Khaled remained calm, retreating as well.\nIn the center of it all, all that was left were a group of three Predator Ravens, the smallest and swiftest of them all, assaulting Leonel from all sides.\nKhaled's response immediately cured all of his formation's weaknesses. He had expected Leonel's calm expression to crack, but to his surprise, there wasn't even the slightest shift.\nFrom start to finish, Leonel had only shot a single arrow. The rest of the time, he spent calculating the safest lines of trajectory he would take to dodge around these beasts.\nWell… That was at least what it seemed like.\nBut, Leonel's real target had been his target from the very beginning.\nA particular bird beast that now had just a single eye and was in much too much pain to follow Khaled's orders perfectly.",

      "content": "Khaled's expression changed.\nHe had already commanded that Predator Raven to man the perimeter, but it hadn't listened.\n'No, it's not that it wasn't listening, something's making it not listen… This boy!'\nLeonel had realized long ago that Khaled's commands could be interrupted.\nFor Khaled to have been sent to command this aerial assault, it was likely that other than gaining City Lord White's trust, it was also due to his ability. By virtue of this, it was easy to extrapolate that Khaled had likely been the one in command of the predator birds from the very beginning.\nAfter Leonel realized this, he already had all the information he needed. The fact that his horn could disrupt Khaled's control, even for a moment, meant that it was very much possible for external sources to do so.\nSo, the simple question was… what about pain?\nThis much was easily confirmed. Though it was just for a moment, the Predator Raven completely disregarded Khaled's commands, almost completely disrupting the formation with its erratic flight in those moments just after Leonel pierced its eye.\nThough Khaled managed to regain control of the Predator Raven, there was one thing he didn't notice. Or, rather, two things packaged into one.\nThe first thing was that Leonel had hidden a secondary damage spell within in arrow. And, the second thing was that Leonel had hidden a smaller version of the Force Arts drawn onto his horn as well.\nThe instant he realized that his hypothesis was correct, he activated the secondary damage spell, causing the Raven a surge of pain once again. And, right afterward, he activated the beast taming Force Arts to disrupt Khaled's second attempts at controlling the Raven.\nWhen Leonel's [Light Refraction] spell was influenced, he realized a few things.\nFor one, the influence of a single Raven's pupils were exceptionally weak on him. If it wasn't for 500 disrupting his spell at once, it would have never distorted in the first place.\nAnd second, when he used his surfboard to block the view of Khaled while he pulled out the dictionary, he realized that the effect the Ravens had on him were much weaker in that instant. That obviously meant that their abilities weren't area of effect, but rather truly reliant on their sight. At the very least, they had to have a line of sight to the Force Art they wanted to disrupt.\nThis made Leonel realized his second very important thing… These damned birds couldn't disrupt a Force Art that had already been shielded and definitely couldn't disrupt one too small for them to lock eyes on.\nAt this point, though Khaled was startled, he still didn't understand what Leonel's plan was. He could tell that something was interrupting his control and that this thing was most definitely the arrow still lodged in the Raven's eye. But… what was the purpose?\nThere were over 500 Jagged Beak Predator Ravens, all of which had long since surrounded Leonel and were waiting to taste his blood. What good was there to mess with just a single one?\nBut, Khaled's expression changed again when Leonel abruptly changed directions to, seemingly by coincidence, cross paths with the erratically flying bird.\nWith a flip of his palm, Leonel's bow disappeared, only to be replaced by a pitch-black spear.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\n'Chain Domain.'\nThe Predator Raven was suddenly tightly bound in the sky, its wings pinned to body and its claws pressed flush against itself.\nVeins popped out across Leonel's forehead, but he didn't retreat.\nHis back flexed as the Predator Raven hung in the air beneath his might. He could see its enraged eyes trying to bore into his soul. One was a blood red while the other dripped with crimson, its precious life dripping to the ground far beneath them.\nHowever, when it saw Leonel's cold, calculating eyes looking back toward it, the bird felt fear for the first time in maybe its life. It suddenly stopped struggling, its blood running cold.\nIn a lot of ways, beasts were just more of what humans were innately but tried to hide. Their sense of strict hierarchy was even more damning, even more rigorous, even more demanding.\nWhen facing a being superior to you, beasts lowered their heads…\nEven if it meant certain death.\nLeonel's spear shot into the Predator Raven's eye, an undeniable callousness in his gaze as he felt his blade run deep into its skull and through its brain.\nSpear Force burst out, mincing the insides of the Predator Raven in an instant. But, it was what happened next that made Khaled's heart truly seize.\nLeonel pulled out his spear, blood spraying through the air as he thrust forth once more. But this time, his target wasn't the dead Raven but rather the crossbow machine strapped to its back.\nThe strap was severed in a single strike, separating out from the Predator Raven's.\nLeonel's Chain Domain released the beast but latched onto the crossbow, causing it float before him in menacing fashion.\nJust like that, in what felt like the blink of an eye, the entire situation had shifted.\nAll around, there were hundreds of Predator Ravens, each outfitted with a crossbow, but not a single one with the capability of firing one.\nAnd then there was Leonel. He was just one man, but he had suddenly become the center of the battlefield.\nHis gaze still cool, suffused with indifference, he used his Chain Domain to load the first bolt, his eyes locking onto Khaled once more.\nA wave of danger seized the heart of the White Knight. Before, he felt his movements were clever. Clearing out the Predator Ravens to surround and suffocate Leonel seemed to have been the perfect move at the time. But now, he felt as though he had cosigned his own death.\nThe irony of it was that as a commander, he didn't even have a crossbow of his own.\nThe indifference in Leonel's gaze was almost beginning to drive Khaled mad. There was no sense of achievement or victory or even complacency or happiness in his eyes. It was as though what hovered before him wasn't a human, but rather a series of data points to be callously observed.\nAnd then… Leonel released the bolt.\nSHUUUUU! BANG!\nThe sound barrier shattered in an instant. It happened so quickly that by the time it was registered, Khaled was already trying to dodge out of the way.\nBut, unfortunately for the White Knight, Leonel's target was never him.\nKWWAAAA—\nIt was a devastating sight. The cry of the Raven hardly sounded before its head imploded into fleshly bits of crimson gore. The bolt was so powerful that it continued without losing momentum, piercing through the heart of another Raven several hundred meters behind the first and causing it to implode as well.\nWhite Knight Diore found himself falling through the skies, a half-stunned expression on his face.\nHe lost?\nLeonel looked on from up above, his gaze locking onto Khaled's falling figure as his Chain Domain adjusted the aim of the crossbow toward the White Knight.\nToday, he would send a resounding message to the people of Terrain.",

      "content": "Khaled felt his heart seize. Something told him that no matter what he did, it would be impossible to dodge out of the way of this strike.\nThe White Knight roared at the top of his lungs, unleashing all the Force he had. There was simply no point in keeping anything in reserve. What good was reserve strength if he was dead?\nHe didn't bother to pull out his glider. At this moment, he didn't want anything slowing his descent toward the ground. In fact, the faster he hit the ground, the better. As for whether he could survive such an impact, he would deal with just a single problem at a time.\nBANG!\nThe sound barrier shattered. Roaring winds shot in every direction, clearing out a path for the released bolt. It felt for a moment as though it was cleaving the clouds with a single sword strike.\nKhaled flipped a palm, causing a spear to appear.\nHe poured all of his Force into it, striking out with all the might he could muster as he fell from the skies.\nAt the same time, he kicked hard at the air, flipping himself upside down to careen toward the ground even faster.\nHe hoped that the fact he was falling in the same direction as the bolt along with the fact he was putting his all into stopping it would dampen the strength somewhat. But, reality was cruel.\nThough he was correct in his assessment, the diminishment in strength was practically negligible.\nKhaled's spear point met the bolt, his eyes practically bulging out of their sockets under his strain. In that moment, he could swear that he had never put so much strength into a strike before. But…\nHis spear point splintered apart like dried weed. The bolt continued forward as though cutting through air, blasting a bloody hole so large in his shoulder that it took his arm along with it.\nWhite Knight Diore paled.\nHis arm spun aimlessly in the air, sparkling droplets of crimson dancing around it. It looked as if a canon ball had taken a quarter of his body with it, trying its very best to reap his life.\nIn that moment, his spinning arm was sheered apart by the harsh winds left trailing the bolt. Had it not been for the Force Khaled had protecting his body, his head might have suffered the same force.\nLeonel coldly looked on from above, nocking another bolt.\nHis senses swept over it all. It seemed that every crossbow had only been outfitted with three bolts. But, judging by their strength, Leonel understood why. With such devastating power, it was unlikely for any formation to survive the combination of the Predator Ravens' abilities and this crossbow assault. In addition, weight was a huge issue when it came to such an aerial assault and each one of these bolts rivaled even the crossbow itself in heft.\nBut just one more bolt was fine. Since Khaled had given him such an opening, Leonel didn't believe he wouldn't be able to kill him.\nLeonel coldly aimed for the last time, watching the White Knight's falling figure.\nAt that moment, several of the Predator Ravens had swarmed once again, trying to obstruct Leonel's sight toward their commander. But, Leonel didn't flinch. If Khaled thought that he would lose sight because of this, he was sorely mistaken.\nFrom start to finish, Leonel's Internal Sight had been completely locked onto Khaled. Beyond this, would the bolt really be stopped by just a few bodies considering its strength?\nLeonel's chest expanded with an even breath. As though he was syncing with the crossbow, he released the moment he began to exhale, his calm breathing contrasting with the shattering boom of the bolt's speed.\nKWWAAA!!\nThe bolt instantly tore through three Raven bodies in the blink of an eye, showering the skies in crimson.\nPanic gripped Khaled's heart. He continuously kicked the air, trying to quicken his descent. Every time he did, he left concentric circles in the sky, accelerating himself downward with each attempt.\nBut the bolt was simply too fast. He realized at that point that obstructing Leonel's vision had been useless. In fact, using so many Ravens to block him only gave him easy access to more bolts.\nA strong feeling of helplessness gripped at Khaled's heart, but his expression remained the same as all others who had died to Leonel's hand on this day.\nHe looked up toward his murderer, his gaze locking onto Leonel's. All he received in return was a plain stare, the same one that told him he was nothing but a data point, the same one that didn't seem to care for who he was as a person.\nSHUUUU! BANG!\nThere was no sound when the bolt shot through Khaled's chest. In fact, it seemed as though the bolt had only flown through another patch of air.\nRather, the huge crashing sound came from the bolt colliding with the ground and leaving a crater that rivaled the impact of a small meteor.\nFor a moment, there was only a bloody hole. And in the next, Khaled's body imploded, shattering from the inside out into a rain of blood and gore.\nHaving realized he made another mistake by calling the Ravens to come and protect him, Khaled didn't bother to protect himself in the end, opting to simply stare at the man who ended his life. It was the kind of look only a man dauntless of death could form in his final moments.\nMaybe, from the very beginning, Khaled's anxiousness, his panic, his trembling, never had anything to do with the danger his life was in and everything to do with his unwillingness to fail the mission he was given.\nLeonel took a deep breath before releasing the crossbow in his Chain Domain and gasping for breath. He coughed several times, his lungs screaming beneath the strain.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nLeonel's chest heaved as he tried to give the little mink a reassuring smile.\nCalculating the trajectory of such a fast bolt hadn't been a problem for Leonel. Others couldn't guarantee such accuracy and could only use these crossbows as siege weapons, but Leonel was different.\nThis was all to say that the reason for his fatigue wasn't this, but rather his use of his Chain Domain. But, it couldn't be helped, his surfboard couldn't fit such a large, heavy crossbow onto it.\nLeonel shook his head, turning his gaze toward where the gliders had disappeared to. By now, they were definitely closing in on the first Barony. Even without the Predator Ravens, that city didn't stand a chance against so many Fourth Dimensional existences.\n'… Dammit.'",

      "content": "Leonel was just one person. Before he even battled White Knight Diore, he had already tired his mind using so many wind spells. After this battle, he was even more spent.\nLeonel finally steadied his breathing and looked around at what was left of the Predator Ravens.\nUnfortunately, Leonel didn't have an easy method of controlling these beasts. His horn was designed for Third Dimensional beasts. But, even then, he couldn't precisely control those Third Dimensional beasts, he could only rile them up into a frenzy and give them simple commands like pointing out a target to trample and targets to avoid like he had done in his final battle on Camelot.\nThis time, what Leonel had done was even simpler, he poured his Dream Force into the horn in order to influence these massive predator birds. Essentially, he forced them into temporary madness and this was the extent of his abilities.\nPlus, even if Leonel could make use of these birds, he wouldn't dare to. Believing that White City only had a single method of controlling these Ravens would be absolutely foolish.\nIf Leonel brought these birds into battle and they were suddenly turned against him, that would be the worst kind of mistake. Such a thing could completely turn the tide of battle.\nThat said, Leonel also couldn't allow White City to so easily gain back these beasts for nothing. Leonel was absolutely certain that the loss of 500 of these Predator Ravens would sting for them. But, how could he easily get rid of them?\nLeonel's eyes flashed.\n\"Little Blackstar.\"\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nThe little mink launched himself off of Leonel's head, diving down and through the skies.\nIt quickly came back with a shadow ball it eagerly swallowed from the top of Leonel's head.\nLeonel nodded. Though he had to dispel Little Blackstar's sharpening ability which had come in very useful several times already, he had no choice but to make a sacrifice in this matter.\n\"Command them to battle to the death.\" Leonel said.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nLeonel didn't have the heart to monitor such a scene so he allowed the little mink to oversee it as he descended from the skies.\nBy now, Aina had dug up several dozen knights, most of whom were heavily injured and unconscious.\nLeonel frowned because he didn't see Lancelot among them. It can't be that Lancelot really died, right?\nIn the beginning, Leonel had been paying attention so that he could direct Aina. But, after a while, he had to completely focus on the battle so he sent all the locations at once and focused his everything on Khaled.\nAina raised her brows when Leonel appeared. \"You're fine?\"\n\"Did you ever doubt it?\" Leonel asked with a grin.\nSeeing that Leonel was in the mood to lighten the atmosphere, Aina felt a weight on her chest lower.\nHer senses weren't as powerful as Leonel's. So, through the dust cloud, she couldn't really see or feel what Leonel was facing. She felt somewhat better knowing that it couldn't have been too dangerous, then.\nOf course, had she known the truth, let alone feeling relief now, she wouldn't have even allowed Leonel to go. But as the saying goes, ignorance is bliss.\nSeemingly realizing Aina's line of thinking, Leonel frowned.\n\"What happened to your sense boosting treasure?\"\nLeonel remembered that Aina had used one of her Quasi Bronze rewards from the Joan Zone on a headpiece that covered her one weakness. But, ever since they reunited, Leonel hadn't seen it again.\nEven to the current Leonel, a Quasi Bronze treasure was a big deal. Currently, he only had one broken one he had yet to repair while the second was his Force Crafting quill. Losing such a treasure was definitely a big deal.\n\"That…\" Aina hesitated.\nShe seemed to flashback to memories she didn't quite want to remember.\nLeonel's frown deepened when he saw Aina's reaction. Just what happened to her on Terrain, exactly? It seemed as though every time he got close to touching upon it, she would pull back.\nLeonel never pressed Aina to tell him anything, especially when it was related to her family. But, he didn't have any reason to believe that this was related to the Brazinger family and he was serious about the words he had spoken to her before.\nHe wanted Aina to lean and rely on him. But, if she never opened up to him, such a thing would be impossible.\nThough Leonel had taken Mordred's advice and stopped being a 'pansy', if he was always the only one pushing, even he could grow tired of such a thing.\n\"… I lost it to an Invalid.\"\nLeonel's eyes widened. \"What?\"\nLeonel panicked slightly, taking a step toward Aina as though he wanted to check if she was injured anywhere. It was completely irrational considering this must have happened months ago, but he couldn't help himself.\nThe Invalid Aina must be referring to was most definitely from Terrain. Any Invalid that had last so long on an old world was powerful beyond Leonel's imagining.\nOne had to remember that Invalids were only borne from those who failed to awaken their abilities. They couldn't be birthed from those who succeeded nor could they reproduce amongst themselves. This meant that the same population of Invalids a world produced in the very beginning would be the very same population of Invalids they had until the day the world died or all the Invalids were eliminated.\nThere were very few, exceptionally rare exceptions to this rule. Any instances that could break this rule would be cherished by Invalids all over.\nThough Terrain was weak, it was still a world with hundreds of years of history within the Fourth Dimension. This meant that any Invalid Aina ran into was definitely at least that old.\nAnd, at such an age… the likelihood that they'd be a Variant Invalid shot through the roof.\nLeonel held onto Aina's shoulders, his heart beating even more wildly than when he had been battling a White Knight far beyond him in strength.\nHe truly felt like he had almost lost Aina forever.\nJust what happened, exactly?",

      "content": "Seeing Leonel's reaction, Aina didn't know how to react herself for a long while. The level of worry in his gaze, even for something that had long since passed, left her feeling at a loss.\n\"I… It's wasn't a big deal, I'm here, aren't I?\"\nLeonel frowned at this response, he could sense Aina pulling away. Such a scene made him sigh and release his grip on her.\n\"Where is Lancelot? Did you not find him?\"\nLeonel changed the topic, but this left Aina at even more of a loss.\nForcing things and reaching the end goal as quickly as possible always seemed like the path with the most satisfaction. A slow, long grind wasn't something most people wanted to deal with and it was even something that scared most away.\nThough Leonel had spoken so many heartfelt words to Aina, they were ultimately words he had spoken himself. They weren't words that Aina had said, nor were they necessarily the way she, herself, felt.\nWhether she did or not wasn't something Leonel knew, nor was it quite the point regardless of what the truth was. What truly matter was that even if she did, she wasn't at a point where she was ready to say them.\nThis wasn't necessarily the end of the world.\nThe pursuit of Aina had always been a one-person affair. Leonel never took Aina's standoffishness to heart because in his mind, it was his task to get her to warm up to him. If he failed, then it was because he was inadequate, it wasn't her fault.\nBut, this very same logical mind of Leonel's also understood that relationships weren't supposed to work in this way. As logical as he was, he also had exceptionally high emotional intelligence.\nHe felt that his and Aina's relationship had taken a step forward she very clearly wasn't ready for. When things reached such a point, dragging her along would do more harm than good.\nHowever, this abrupt change in Leonel from overly caring to, as though he had flipped a switch, strictly business… It left Aina not knowing how to face him.\nMaybe for the first time, she realized just how true Leonel's words from before were. He didn't lie to her, there was no hidden truth she had to uncover… he laid out the way his mind worked and the kind of person he was right before her.\nLeonel might have been kind and caring, but it was all built upon a foundation of cold calculation. What drove him first and foremost was logic.\nSince he decided Aina wasn't ready to truly treat him as her boyfriend, he took a step back with ease… almost too much ease.\nWatching it all play out exactly how Leonel described left Aina feeling somewhat…\nCold.\nShe realized that if there really came a day where she didn't trust him, where she didn't lean on him as he would lean on her… He really wouldn't come to save her.\nAina's lips trembled, but she clenched her jaw and swallowed hard forcing back the emotions she was feeling and not allowing her tears to fall. Her small reactions were missed by Leonel who had started to analyze the fallen knights, calculating if he could spare the stamina to heal them and by how much he would be able to do so.\n\"… While I was digging up the others, Lancelot managed to climb back up himself. He gathered the ones who could still fight and rushed off to the Lin Barony. If it wasn't ruined, they plan on taking a shortcut to the backside of the Barony and hopefully help fortify their defenses.\"\nLeonel raised his brows when he heard these words, looking back toward Aina. By now, she had already gone back to normal as though nothing had happened.\n\"Hm… They have a chance to make it before the gliders get there.\"\nThough the gliders had a head start and were flying through the skies, because they were gliding rather than truly flying, their speed was obviously lacking.\nLeonel doubted that the loss of their commander would slow them by much. Such organized armies definitely had a clear line of succession. Those who were meant to step up had likely already done so. Leonel wouldn't underestimate such an army in the slightest.\n\"Did they describe the shortcut to you?\" Leonel asked.\nAina shook her head no.\nLeonel could only accept this. He hadn't been too hopeful to begin with. There was no time to do such a thing. And, even if there was, there was no guarantee the explanations would have been clear enough to make use of them.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nAt that moment, Little Blackstar dove down from the skies, skipping on his little shadowy platforms to dive into Aina's arms.\nLeonel smiled lightly. \"Done?\"\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nLeonel nodded. \"Pass me their Beast Crystals and crossbows, they might be useful in the future.\"\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nLittle Blackstar vanished into Leonel's spatial ring and entered the Segmented Cube with ease. Sometimes Leonel wondered if the little guy had a spatial affinity rather than a Dark Elemental affinity. But, he knew better. Though they looked quite similar in function, they were very different.\nThose with Space Elemental affinities were moving through space whereas Little Blackstar was entering and exiting the Shadow World. They were functionally the same, but technically different.\nAfter transferring all the Beast Crystals and crossbows from his Shadow World and into the Lab Setting, the little mink dove out and back into Aina's embrace.\nLeonel looked over the knights again and cast a quick [Grand Heal] a few times. When he was sure that none of their lives were in danger and that a few would wake up soon, he called down his jet black surfboard again.\nStepping onto it, Leonel turned a light smile toward Aina and stretched out a hand.\nAina was a bit stunned, but still reached out.\n\"Hang on tight.\" Leonel said, wrapping an arm around her waist.\nAina subconsciously wrapped her arms around Leonel's back as they shot into the skies.\n\"Yip! Yip!\" The little mink called out in dissatisfaction, feeling squished. Without a choice, the little guy could only wiggle out and find a new location within the Segmented Cube. Maybe going to tease Tolliver would make it feel better.\nAina, however, looked up to view of Leonel's side profile. Realizing that he wasn't paying attention to her, she lowered her head back into his chest.\nA single tear fell from her eyes but just as quickly as it appeared, it was absorbed by Leonel's robes.",

      "content": "Camelot suffered a great blow on the first day. White City's assault was swift and didn't contain the slightest hint of mercy.\nBy the time Leonel and Aina made it to the city, it was already under siege by those over thousand gliders. Realizing it was a lost cause, rather than trying to fight a losing battle, Lancelot focused all his efforts on retreat, evacuating as many as he could\nLeonel and Aina of course spent their time helping these efforts.\nThough Leonel had the crossbows now, he could at most shoot a single one at a time. This was the limitation of his Chain Domain.\nEven when he wasn't in the skies, he realized that the trouble loading the crossbows was greater than he originally thought. The amount of strength it took was astronomical and beyond him.\nOne solution to this was to rely on Aina to do this, but then came the problem of aiming. Only Leonel could make a siege weapon like those massive crossbows accurate enough to target single individuals.\nEven if Aina loaded the crossbows for him, he would still need to aim them. And, he could obviously only aim a single one at a time due to the limitations of his Chain Domain.\nA target was always changing and shifting their position. Leonel couldn't possibly expect to aim so many crossbows at once with such a blatant weakness. And, aiming just one and firing a single bolt at a time couldn't possibly allow him to stop an army of over a thousand, especially with how dauntless they were.\nIt was better to keep the crossbows as a trump card for the future. Leonel even thought it might be nice to spend some time modifying them to make them easier to use.\nWith his current strength, his imprint on this war definitely wouldn't be made by his fists. If he wanted to have an impact, it would definitely have to be with his Crafts.\n**\nLeonel returned to Camelot to find the dark atmosphere he had originally seen had become even heavier.\nWhat no one could have possibly expected was for a new enemy to appear before they even finished dealing with The Empire. Not only was this enemy more cruel than The Empire, but they even seemed to be more powerful.\nLeonel and Aina were eventually led to their rooms. But, who knows if Mordred got to the organizers or not, but it was once again just a singular room.\nLeonel swept a glance around. Though the room was just as if not more luxurious than the one Mordred had given them, it was levels lower in romantic hues. In such a situation, it felt difficult not to read more into this than one should.\nRather than warm lavender, red and violet colors, it had a bland whiteness to it. And, instead of a refreshing, soothing scent, the room didn't have a particular smell to it at all.\nThe neutrality of it all hung with an odd heaviness.\nWell, this was the case to Aina. For Leonel, he didn't feel any particular way as though he had already disconnected himself from it all.\nWith a flip of his palm the Segmented Cube appeared and expanded to its five by five by five meter size. Despite its size, it only took up about 20% of the large room.\n\"If you want to use the cleansing waters, you can. It should be easy for you to enter, just reach out with your Internal Sight.\n\"I'm going to go and see if I can gather any materials from Camelot's warehouses. If I can't, I'll also speak to Em to see if the Demon Empire has the things I need.\"\n\"Materials?\" Aina asked softly.\n\"Mhm.\" Leonel nodded. \"I'm not very powerful now so all I can do is make things with my hands. If there's an opportunity, I'll make a replacement for the headpiece you lost.\"\n\"You're a… Force Crafter?\" Aina's soft voice carried a hint of surprise.\nLeonel grinned. \"How is it, I'm pretty amazing, right?\"\nLeonel's smile seemed to light up the room. Though this space already had plenty of sunlight rebounding off its white walls, it lacked the same warmth…\nAina didn't move even a long while after Leonel had left.\nEventually, she walked slowly to the bed, crawling onto its head and pulling her knees into her chest.\nA touch of redness crept onto her nose as her eyes watered. She stared off into empty space, seemingly looking at nothing and thinking of nothing. But, the emotions threatening to spill over were undeniable.\nShe squeezed her knees tighter.\nAt first it seemed as though she was simply in an emotional state, but soon, it reached beyond that.\nThe crackling of bones sounded in the quiet room. It took only a moment for one to realize that the bones that were breaking were Aina's own.\nAs quickly as she broke them, she healed them, only for her to fracture them once more.\nIn any other context, this was just training taken to an extreme. Breaking down one's body and reforming it was the simplest form of training. However, within context, it felt like something much darker, like a heavy fog hanging over a young woman's life.\nA person's worst enemy could often be themselves. In the beginning, it might have seemed that Leonel was the only one who needed to grow and to mature, but it was easy to forget that Aina, too, was just an 18-year-old girl.\nAina grew up alone. Under the welfare of The Empire, most in thanks to her Five Star Professional evaluation, she was never homeless nor starving. But, regardless, she was alone.\nShe didn't meet Yuri until the later years of her middle school days and always had trouble connecting with her or anyone, for that matter.\nShe was stuck in a quagmire of her own thoughts. Even if she wanted to connect with someone, she had no idea how to.\nAina continued to stare off into blank space, her tears half fallen, but not quite, her emotions half spoken, but not quite, her heart half broken… but not quite.",

      "content": "\"You want to enter our treasure vaults?\"\nArthur's lip twitched as he looked toward Leonel.\nWhat kind of King would allow someone not even of their Kingdom to randomly enter their vaults and choose as they please? Even if one was a loyal citizen, it might only be possible to enter once every several years to pick out one or two things… Yet, not only was Leonel asking for free reign to do as he pleased, he wasn't even a person of Camelot.\nDespite this, Arthur felt like he couldn't say no.\nMaybe aside from him and a few founding members of Camelot, Leonel had done more for the Kingdom than anyone else. And, beyond that, Leonel was the reason he felt happier now than he had in a very long time. He had even managed to have dinner with his daughter just last night.\nOf course, Arthur didn't say these things aloud. After all, he had just lost a fifth of his Kingdom and was in line to lose much more of it before all of this was over. Plus, many of his citizens were in danger.\nBut, after making his decision, he had already been ready to lose everything. So, how much of a need was there for him to care about such a loss?\n\"Yes.\" Leonel smiled and nodded as though it wasn't a big deal.\n\"Are you trying to extort me, kid?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\n\"Pft.\"\nKing Arthur's head snapped in a particular direction. But, by the time he locked eyes on his son, Lionus was already looking off into the distance as though nothing had happened.\n\"Nice weather we're having, huh?\" Lionus rubbed his nose, scanning the room.\nUnfortunately for his act, the only window in the throne room was exceptionally high up and was angle such that it only shone a small light on the throne itself. So, how could he possibly know with any sort of detail the kind of weather they were having?\nKing Arthur shook his head. Lionus had always been so obedient. He couldn't help but feel that Leonel was having a bad influence on his son.\nAt this point, Leonel's smile faded somewhat and he became more serious.\n\"Arthur, I've told Em this already but you should be aware as well. If you don't want to lose too much of your power after submitting to The Empire, what's important is to show your worth. Repelling this invasion is a great opportunity for you.\n\"Since Terrain dares to do this, they're confident. I'm certain that they've scouted out Earth and understand more about our world than even maybe we do. The Empire will definitely be in trouble and Terrain definitely won't stop until they claim the world for themselves. The greatest variable in this war is you all, Camelot and the Demon Empire.\"\n\"Terrain?\" King Arthur raised an eyebrow. \"You seem to know a lot about these enemies?\"\n\"Not a lot, just more than most.\"\n\"And you believe that by opening up the vaults to you our likelihood of winning will be greater?\"\n\"Exponentially so.\"\n\"And how am I supposed to make certain that you aren't embezzling anything?\"\nLeonel blinked and smiled once more. \"You don't. Just take it as my worker's fee.\"\n\"… Shameless.\"\n**\n\"These are your vaults?\" Leonel raised his brows in surprised.\nLionus smiled. \"Yes, this should be the greatest treasure store on Camelot. The only rival to us might be big sister's Empire.\"\nThe area was much larger than anything he expected.\nThe vaults were located on the basement floor of the castle. And, despite the size of the castle itself, it took up several floors, a whole three levels to be exact. The amount of space totaled up to more than a square kilometer, it was absolutely inconceivable that there would actually be enough treasure to fill it all up with.\nThe first floor was filled with stacks of gold coins. Leonel felt as though he had walked into a dragon's den. He was certain that just the existence of this place was a huge hazard. If one of these gold piles slipped, it could easily bury someone alive.\nStill, Leonel wasn't very interested in these piles of gold. On Earth, gold had lost its value a long time ago. Other than being a good conductor, it wasn't very useful otherwise. It was too soft of a metal and not very good for weapons or armors.\nIt was unfortunate for Camelot, but it seemed that in any places other than their Kingdom, this first floor of 'treasures' was quite useless.\nHowever… there were two more floors below this one.\n\"This…\"\nLeonel didn't know what to say for a long time. The store of Ores seemed endless. They piled up into what seemed like perpetuity.\nThough most were Pseudo Fourth Dimensional Ores, their value was so much greater than the gold on the first level that they couldn't even be properly compared. It felt like blasphemy to do so.\nAnd here Leonel thought he was somewhat of a tycoon after mining the hive, only to find out that he was still very much a poor man if he was comparing himself to a true Kingdom.\nBut this made sense. Camelot had 'existed' as a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional world for a very long time. Over the years, it only made sense that they would gather so many precious Ores.\nEven if there was nothing else, Leonel felt that he could create so much with just what was before him.\nHe saw several mountainous piles of Urbe Ore, countless types of Vein and Elemental Ores, he even saw some true Fourth Dimensional Ores hidden within that might have slipped through the cracks.\nYet… there was still one more floor.\nAs shocked as Leonel was on the second, the third floored him. He finally bowed down. He was indeed a poor man, he apologized for ever believing that he was wealthy.\nNo matter where he looked, there were endless mountainous piles of Fourth Dimensional Ores. If the gold piles could have buried a normal human, these could bury even Lancelot and King Arthur.\nSeeing such a sight, Leonel thought that King Arthur was too stingy for even hesitating to say yes to him. Even if he wanted to take and use it all, would he even be able to?\nBut, at the same time, Leonel was shocked.\nJust how did a Pseudo Fourth Dimensional world like this produce so many Fourth Dimensional metals? There even seemed to be more of them than there was on the second level? How did that even make any sense?\nIt was safe to say that any guilt Leonel would have felt taking advantage of Camelot like this flew out the window.",

      "content": "\"How did you gather so much?\" Leonel finally asked Lionus.\n\"These?\" Lionus started. \"This room didn't use to be so full. It got like this after the Merlin Trials collapsed.\"\nLeonel's eyes widened. \"You mean?\"\n\"Mm. These used to be rewards you could spend Skill Points to buy. But, after the Trials collapsed, they were all collected up by us.\"\nLeonel was speechless.\nBack then, he had been mostly worried about gathering up the core of the trial world. Since he was taking it, he felt it would be too shameless to take anything else, so he only accepted the goddess necklace after Crakos brought it to him personally.\nBut, he hadn't expected that he had really missed out on so much…\nNow that Leonel thought about it, when he was within the trials, he had been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of items within the Special Store. So, instead of scrolling through all of them one by one, he used his voice to filter for what he wanted to look for.\nIn that situation, he didn't really have time to leisurely scroll through the store, so he always filtered using his voice. Due to this, he didn't have a proper understanding of the scope of items that could be found within the Special Store.\n'… I was too nice…' Leonel thought to himself.\nLeonel shook his head.\nMost of the Ores he saw here were Tier 1 to 3 Black Grade Ores, this put them at the lower levels of the Fourth Dimension. But, the sheer volume might very well beyond anything even The Empire had managed to gather to this point.\nOf course, Leonel couldn't confirm this with any sort of certainty, but he felt that he likely wasn't too far off with his assessment.\n'… My Divine Armor… If I can…'\nLeonel slowly shook his head.\nHe didn't feel he was skilled enough to complete his Divine Armor just yet, not to mention the fact he hadn't even decided just what kind of Divine Armor to build.\nStill, if there was ever a place to train, this would be it. And, there was likely no better place for Leonel to find the resources he needed to build it.\n'Wait…!'\nLeonel's gaze swept through the massive treasure house.\nAt that moment, he suddenly shot forward, stunning Lionus who had been by his side.\n\"Wait for me!\" Lionus ran after Leonel.\nLionus had unfortunately yet to reach the peak of the Third Dimension, so he hadn't broken through like his father, mother, sister and the others. So, he was obviously no match for Leonel in speed.\nLuckily, this store house was only a few hundred meters in length and width. Even though Leonel was much faster, he couldn't go very far to begin with.\nLionus found Leonel amidst a pile of ores, his hand pressed flush against its side.\n\"Ah… Be careful, if it falls over.\"\nLeonel nodded, acknowledging Lionus' worries. If he died beneath a pile of precious Ores he had just been greedily eyeing, wouldn't that be too pathetic?\nThe pile suddenly shifted, causing Lionus' heart to seize. But, Leonel didn't panic.\nSoon, as though by magic, the pile separated, revealing a radiant piece of Ore.\nLeonel grabbed onto the Ore as the rest of the pile settled down. Only then did Lionus feel his heart calm down once again.\nHe had forgotten that Leonel was a Variant Earth Mage. Something like this was within his abilities. But, the level of control that was needed was beyond Lionus' imagining.\nLionus shook his head and looked curiously at the shimmering black Ore in Leonel's hands.\n\"You recognize this Ore?\" Lionus asked, somewhat curious.\nThough they had brought all of these Ores here, the truth was that they had yet to research most of their functions. In this aspect, they were still very much in the dark compared to others.\nUsually, the Merlin Trials would have a short explanation of what the Ore was before they chose it. But, obviously, with it collapsed, it couldn't provide such functionality.\n\"This? I recognize all the Ores.\" Leonel said with a smile. \"This one is Black Urbe Ore, it's a foundational type metal used as a fusion agent in Crafts. It works almost like iron in that it has a base type that can be forged into all sorts of chemical structures depending on your approach and technique. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it was the most important Ore in the entire universe.\n\"This one is special though because it was on the verge of becoming Bronze Urbe Ore before it was mined from its Core. So, the Ore Essence within it is a margin purer than regular Black Urbe Ore. This Ore might be able to help me clear a final hurdle in my Metal Body.\"\nLionus' brows raised in surprise.\nIt wasn't because of Leonel's detailed explanation, but rather because Leonel said he recognized all of these Ores.\nEven though Lionus wasn't educated on the topic, he could easily tell that there were hundreds of types of Ores in this room, each with their own unique variations. To be able to recognize them all would take an absolute expert.\nLeonel took a deep breath. \"First, I need to organize this room. There's no order to anything.\"\nLeonel always liked things to be neat and tidy, this was why his room was always meticulously kept after, though he cared less about his own appearance. It was just a quirk of his.\nHe had the compulsion to organize these ores by type and ability. It would make what he wanted to do next much more efficient.\n\"Things may get a bit wild, Lionus. Stay close to me if you'd like to remain here.\"\nLionus nodded and then shook his head.\n\"It's fine. I have a feeling this will take a long time, no need for me to continuously be looking over your shoulder.\" Lionus chuckled. \"If you need anything else, just let me know. There will be another council gathering soon to strategize defensive measures, we also can't be certain of The Empire's plans now and if they've changed…\"\nLeonel nodded in acknowledgement. He didn't expect everyone to base plans around him to begin with. It may very well be possible that Arthur wasn't too optimistic about him from the beginning.\nIn the end, he was just a single Third Dimensional being. How much change could he really cause?\nAt the moment, it was very likely that all the Forts and the capital were being attacked. If Leonel wanted to swing his weight around, he would need more.\nLeonel could already sense that there was the Evolution Ore he had been looking for, for so long hidden in these piles. It was just unfortunately more difficult to reach. There was no doubt that this Evolution Ore was the most important centerpiece of his Divine Armor and there was just enough of it to form the three portions of Essence he needed.\nLeonel's gaze sharpened as he looked around.. This would be his battlefield.",

      "content": "The instant Lionus had left the range, the treasure vault became a violent storm of swirling ores.\nLeonel sat at the very center of it all, in silent meditation. Ores swooped inches from his body at speeds that surpassed a bullet, yet he didn't flinch. How could he? They were all in his control to begin with.\nIf others were watching on, they would find that the disorganized store of Ores was very quickly tending toward disorganized order. Then from there, it very quickly became completely tidy.\nBeads of sweat fell down Leonel's brow. Without a choice, he activated his Bronze Runes. This instantaneously made the control of the metals around him several times easier even to the point that the speed they whizzed around the room with even accelerated.\nIt should have been impossible for Leonel to control so many Ores at once. At the very least, he shouldn't have been able to guarantee that they didn't crash into each other. After all, Leonel could split his mind more than a dozen ways, but it definitely wasn't to the point of being able to do so hundreds of ways.\nRather, Leonel used a much cleverer method. He drew a map of the treasure stores in his Dream World, rebuilding a three dimensional construct. Then, he color coded pathways for the Ores to follow, ensuring that these pathways rarely, if ever, crossed.\nAlmost as though he was playing a game, Leonel sorted these Ores one after another. This way, all he had to do was focus on ensuring that the Ores always stuck to these pathways and it was not necessary for him to split his mind more than a dozen or so ways, each for a different kind of Ore.\nVery quickly, Leonel spread out the Ores, arranging them into neat rows with clean roads between them.\nThe first division was in Ore types. There was a section for Foundational Ores, Veins Ores, Vessel Ores, Domain Ores and finally, the pile Leonel was most looking forward to, Evolution Ores.\nFoundational Ores were over 70% made of Urbe Ores. Other Foundational Ores simply weren't as common or as useful. They had very specific use cases that made them almost useless. And, often times, their functions could be accomplished by Urbe Ore to an even better degree. So, other Foundational Ores were only used in rare instances.\nThe only Foundational Ore that made Leonel take a pause while observing it was Lava Rhombus Ore. It had only one functional use case: The fusion of Earth and Fire type Ores.\nWhen hearing this, one can understand why such Foundational Ores were looked down upon. For one, Earth and Fire weren't opposing elements, Urbe Ore could allow their fusion easily, there was simply no need for this special use case.\nHowever, Leonel, for obvious reasons, was intrigued.\nWhile Urbe Ore could be used in every use case, it also required a high level of skill. Knowing exactly how to temper the Ore to receive the desired effect was the bane of many Force Crafters. These unique Foundation Ores, however, could be used in complex constructs to make them far simpler.\nAfter separating out these five major categories, the rest was obviously down to the Elements and other unique cases like Soul Type Ores.\nOnce Leonel was finished, he looked back toward the smallest pile. Of course, this held the Evolution Ores.\nThere were actually enough for 13 portions of Essence. If Leonel combined this with the seven he already had, this meant that he could form two complete portions of Bronze Evolution Ore!\nOne had to remember that 10 Black Evolution Ores could form a Bronze Evolution Ore and that 100 Bronze Evolution Ores could form a Silver one.\nEvolution Ores had two abilities. The first was fusing two Ores into a unique Ore never before seen. And, its second ability was to evolve an Ore to the next level. A Black Evolution Ore could evolve a Third Dimensional Ore into the Fourth, while a Bronze Evolution Ore could evolve a Fourth Dimensional Ore into the Fifth!\nAccording to the speculations of Leonel's father, if one formed their Divine Armor's core with 10 Black Evolution Ores, it was theoretically possible to form a Quasi Fifth Dimensional Divine Armor while still being within the Fourth Dimension!\nLeonel thought back to the Quasi Bronze Grade Ore he had found within the hive, Warping Domain Ore. If he made it the core of his Divine Armor, wouldn't he be able to cross that barrier and stand firmly within the Fifth Dimension?\nEven if he couldn't, the effects would be so infinitely close to the Fifth Dimension that nothing within the Fourth Dimension would be able to withstand its impact.\nOf course, this wouldn't be in terms of strength but rather in terms of function.\nThough Leonel hadn't settled on the design of his Divine Armor, the one thing he knew for certain was that his Warping Domain Ore would be the center piece of it all.\nWarping Ore was able to create an independent space that could make even a single step feel like an entire mile. Due to this, it was quite well known for its defensive abilities, but as Leonel learned more about Domains, he felt that they were far more flexible than this. The uses of Domain were as variable as the uses of an ability, it depended on a person's creativity to use it properly.\nNow that Leonel had this entire warehouse of Ores available to him, the picture of his Divine Armor came into view. Rather than focusing on attack, defense, or elemental types, his plan would be very simple.\nHe would maximize his own speed while ensuring his enemies felt as though taking even a single step was almost impossible.\nAs Leonel looked through the various Ores, he felt a picture becoming clearer and clearer in his mind. And, the center of it all would be his Warping Domain Ore.\nHowever, whether he would be able to accomplish the aspirations forming in his mind would depend on if he could build up the skill he needed.\nWhile he had many types of Ores around him, there was just a single Warping Domain Ore. Spatial Type treasures were too rare, even to the point there were less than a dozen in this entire treasure store, and only two of which could match up to Warping Domain Ore in value…\nIn that case…\n'Let's give this tiger wings.' Leonel's gaze blazed.\nMaybe even Terrain could have never been aware that their greatest enemy would come in the form of a young man sitting cross legged on the floor of a vast treasure vault.",

      "content": "\"… Eat slowly Little Tolly, slowly now…\"\nLeonel wiped off sweat that threatened to sting his eyes once more.\nHe never forgot that one of the hazards he learned about Metal Spirits was their propensity to overeat. If he let it happen, Tolliver could go mad and harm him.\nThis was the main reason Tolliver had yet to evolve into the Fourth Dimension along with Blackstar. Leonel was very careful about how much he fed him and what he fed him.\nLeonel preferred to give the little fella high quality Ores that would fill him very quickly. This was much better than feeding Tolliver a lot of low-quality Ores.\nThe more high-quality Ores Tolliver ate, the more powerful the little guy would become in relation to its evolution stage. So, Leonel took this very seriously.\n\"Oh…\"\nTolliver suddenly shot out of Leonel's gloved hands. The little guy's body concentrated into a single point before explosively growing.\nLeonel realized that this was a sign that Little Tolly was finally crossing into the Fourth Dimensional realms.\nLeonel's mind had already entered such a realm, so he was very confident that he would still be able to control and command Tolliver appropriately.\nTolliver came back to Leonel looking just that much more lustrous.\n\"Ready to work little guy?\"\n\"Bloop, bloop.\"\nLeonel smiled lightly before his expression suddenly changed.\nHe quickly commanded Little Tolliver to float in the air as he scanned his black gloves. After just a moment, he smiled bitterly, watching it corrode as though having been dipped in strong acid.\nLeonel sighed, peeling the gloves off of his hands before it got worse.\nHe didn't have replacement gloves. And, though he felt he might be able to make them, how would he? He needed gloves to Craft with Little Tolliver but couldn't make the gloves he needed to Craft with Tolliver… without Little Tolliver.\nLeonel grit his teeth.\n'I have been avoiding this training for a long time… No time better than the present.'\nOne of the last lessons of his father's beginners guide was to begin to stray away from gloves.\nThe stronger a Metal Spirit became, the more elaborate a Force Crafter's gloves became. Eventually, they would become a hindrance to hand speed and coordination.\nHonestly, Leonel thought his dad was a madman. As if calling himself Father Overlord wasn't bad enough, the old man actually wanted to kill him.\nLeonel took a deep breath and activated his Bronze Runes once again, thinking back to the words his father had spoken.\n[You are a Morales, the earth bows down to you, not the other way around. Gloves are for cowards]\nIt made Leonel wonder why his father put a hazard section in the dictionary at all. First it was forming a Fifth Dimensional Divine Armor and now it was Force Crafting without protection. Leonel couldn't help but feel that his old man was simply too irresponsible.\nLeonel brought out the first catapult, steadying his beating heart.\nWith a flip of his palm, a familiar chain necklace appeared in Leonel's hand. Fine cracks spread across its surface, causing a flicker of rage to appear in Leonel's heart.\nThis chain necklace was the very first Quasi Bronze treasure Leonel ever possessed. Unfortunately, due to Miles almost blowing him to smithereens, it was heavily damaged.\nThe truth of the matter was that it should have been impossible for explosives of the 21st century like Miles used back then to damage a near Fifth Dimensional treasure.\nThe main issue is that this was an energy based treasure. As a result, it had to rely on the Force around it in order to form its defensive shields. This was exactly why it stopped working when Leonel was under the influence of the Force Disruption Towers.\nSimply put, this chain necklace was using Third Dimensional Force to protect itself and as a result was far weaker than it should have been. If it was using Fourth Dimensional Force, it would likely take at least 24th century explosives and technology to damage it to this extent.\nThat was right. At full strength, this chain necklace could survive several blows from the crossbows that White Knight Diore couldn't survive two strikes of.\nThis was the power of Quasi Bronze treasures, this was their true value.\nIt was just a shame that this chain necklace was damaged…\nFor now, that is.\nThis was Leonel's first test for himself. If he wanted to gain enough skill to build his Divine Armor, he would need to build up his skill just as quickly as he built up his strength within Brave City. The only way he could protect himself, his friends and Aina would be if he had the strength to do so, and this was his fastest path toward that end.\nLeonel smiled lightly. 'If I have my Divine Armor, I won't need this. In that case, I'll combine both necklaces into one… This should be a good birthday present.'\nLeonel took out the Treading Goddess Necklace. His mind spun with thoughts. He wanted to combine three abilities into one. First the defensive abilities of the chain necklace, the teleportation abilities of the Treading Goddess Necklace, and finally, add something on the end to give Aina a sensory boost.\nAfter half an hour of meditation, his gaze grew cold and calculating.\nHe outstretched a hand and allowed Little Tolly to land in his bare palm.\n**\nLeonel hadn't been wrong. Earth was in shambles, facing battles on all fronts. All eight Forts and even the Capital was under siege. The only difference was that the Capital was under siege by two cities with the Moon, Camelot, and the eight Forts only being under siege by one each.\nHowever, surprisingly, at this moment, the Emperor of Earth sat in his garden, the delicate chirping of birds around him. He continued to meditate, raising a cup of tea to his mouth without opening his eyes.\nHe listened intently to a report, not showing any particular reaction.\n\"… That's should be all, Imperial Grandfather. This is the current situation of the Camelot satellite.\"\n\"Mm.\" Emperor Fawkes nodded his head. \"You may go.\"\nNoah hesitated. Was that all his grandfather wanted to tell him? Where were the orders? Should he continue to try and assimilate Camelot and the Demon Empire? Or should he focus on wiping out White City?\n\"… Grandfather…\"\n\"Hm? Is there something else?\"\n\"I…\"\nEmperor Fawkes let out a deep sigh, his eyes opening to reveal two piercing emerald gems. It felt as though he had the whole world within his purview.\n\"Noah, you've grown too reliant on me.\"\n\"…\"\nNoah didn't know what to say. He stared at the talisman in his hand at a complete loss.\n\"Did you know that your cousin is on that satellite right now?\"\nNoah's expression changed.\n\"The very same White Knights you came to report to me about, he's already killed one. He didn't have an army, he didn't have support, he only had himself.\"\nNoah's heart seized. How was that possible? That…\n\"Do not contact me again until White City is nothing but flat earth.\"",

      "content": "Noah placed the talisman down, a small hint of shock on his face. Still, it only took him a moment for him to regain his calm.\nNoah didn't know what his grandfather's ability was. In fact, he was certain that no one knew. Emperor Fawkes was a man who always kept his cards close to his chest. Even his closest advisors might not know everything he was thinking about.\nBut, this was the way of an Emperor. To remain so calm even in the face of everything you and your Ancestors had built potentially burning down… this was the marker of a true ruler.\nThat said, Noah wasn't so certain that this was all about calmness. He always got the sense that his grandfather wasn't calm but rather… confident.\nIt was a subtle difference that was hard to grasp but even harder to fake.\nHowever, as the Prince of the Empire, Noah knew the situation well. And, quite frankly, there was simply nothing to be confident about.\nEarth was caught completely unprepared.\nThis wasn't a failure of Emperor Fawkes and the royal family, but rather simply due to circumstances. Who could have predicted the appearance of Camelot? And who could have predicted that a second acceleration would occur right after the first?\nIn truth, Camelot should have been a variable Terrain couldn't prepare for. But, due to the circumstances, it became a saving grace for them instead.\n\"What would you like to do?\" Jessica interrupted Noah's thoughts. Maybe only she was allowed to listen in on a conversation between the Emperor and a Prince.\nNoah tapped on the large table before him, his thoughts running wild.\nHe wasn't very sure how he felt about his cousin. He didn't hate nor love Leonel, he was about as neutral on the topic as one could get.\nAt the same time, he could also tell that his grandfather wasn't overly eager to bring Leonel back to the palace either.\nThough it was said like this, this wasn't to say that Emperor Fawkes didn't want anything to do with Leonel. If that was the case, he wouldn't praise him so much. Rather, the main point was that the Emperor was content to watch Leonel spread his wings out from afar.\n\"According to the information we have, there's a great possibility that he is within Camelot at the moment.\n\"The dead White Knight that His Imperial Majesty mentioned should have fallen before the attack on the first Barony. That attack occurred within 20 to 30 kilometers of Camelot. This coupled with the fact reports say that Prince Leonel was a part of the Zone trial that brought Camelot here and this is the most appropriate conclusion.\"\nNoah nodded noncommittedly.\n\"… How do you think he managed it?\" Noah couldn't help but ask after a while.\n\"…\"\nJessica didn't respond. She had been with Noah long enough to know that whenever he asked questions he knew they didn't have enough information to answer, that he didn't really expect one.\nNoah was usually a meticulous, hard nosed, and between the lines kind of person. The only moments he acted like this was after he finished speaking with his grandfather. He didn't even seem to have the same aura about him anymore.\nNoah stood, his calm returning in full.\n\"It seems that Imperial Grandfather was correct, there are many eyeing our Earth and some of them might even still be lurking in the shadows even now. Maybe it's time we show them that we aren't pushovers.\"\nNoah walked to the side of his military tent.\nLocated on what would have been a wall, there was a weapon's rack, but it was filled with nothing but sabers. However, shockingly enough, each and every one of these sabers were as large as a human body, carrying blades that seemed capable of cleaving a mountain in two.\nDespite their heft, Noah picked up the first with a single arm. Its radiant blue blade reflected beneath the dim flickering lights. It seemed to exude a magic aura.\n\"This one will do.\"\nWith a flip of his palm, the saber vanished and Noah walked to the entrance of his tent.\n\"Jessica, all the preparations you made for the Demon Empire, forget them for now. We have a city to level.\"\nJessica nodded.\nAccording to their intelligence, the Demon Empire had allied with Camelot and planned to submit to The Empire. With this sudden change, their thoughts might turn from submission to thoughts of taking advantage of The Empire in their time of weakness to maintain their own sovereignty.\nIn that case, rather than giving them a hollow show of power for mere negotiations, they'd show them a real one.\n**\nWithin Camelot's treasure vaults, Leonel had no idea that his grandfather was aware of his presence already. In fact, he wasn't even aware that he had a grandfather to begin with. In Leonel's mind, his only family was his father and his missing mother.\nBut, maybe even if he was aware, he wouldn't have the mind to think about it.\nLeonel sat on the ground, beads of sweat falling down his face.\nIf one stopped focusing on his visage and focused on his hands, it would be possible to see a ghastly sight without compare.\nBlood dripped from Leonel's hands, ricocheting off the ground and echoing through the vast vault.\nLittle Tolly happily swam around Leonel's fingers, not realizing the damage it was causing. But, Leonel couldn't blame the little guy, despite having evolved into the Fourth Dimension, it was still nothing but a toddler. In fact, the little guy hadn't even really begun to form cohesive thoughts of its own.\nThough Leonel could command Blackstar with words, Little Tolly didn't accept such direction well. Leonel had to use a series of images for Tolliver to understand his meaning.\nHowever, understanding didn't make it any less painful.\nThere was good news and bad news.\nThe bad news was that it was almost impossible to suffer such pain and focus on crafting at the same time. How could one maintain a steady connection and complete such intricate actions when it felt like the world was collapsing around them?\nThe good news, however, was that Leonel managed to evolve under pressure and create a new ability. He called the ability Dream Sense.\nSince it was so hard to feel such pain and focus at the same time, why do so at all?\nDream Sense allowed Leonel to split his senses the exact same way he split his mind, it was just an extension of his Dream Clone ability.\nLeonel used Dream Sense to split his mind two ways. One tackled the brunt of the pain he was feeling while the second focused entirely on his Crafting.\nIt was on the third day of using this ability that Leonel evolved once more. He realized something incredibly important.\nIf he could split his senses to help him focus, why not split his sensory pain between several minds? If he did that, wouldn't this allow him to dull his pain by several factors?\nIf he split the same pain between ten minds… Wouldn't he reduce his own pain by a factor of ten?\nThis realization truly opened Leonel up to a new world. If he could control his mind even down to this minute level, just what other possible abilities could his creativity have in store for him?",

      "content": "After grasping an initial mastery of Dream Sense, Leonel realized just how much freedom he had in this regard.\nWhile he could diverge his senses by separating his mind, if he instead chose to layer and concentrate his senses instead, he could cause a convergent response instead.\nIn the end, this meant that Leonel was suddenly capable of both dulling and magnifying his senses by several times, all of which was limited by the number of Dream Clones he could form.\nOn the surface, this wasn't very important, but the applications Leonel could think of were practically endless.\nFor one, if Leonel had the ability to dull his pain in this fashion, he wouldn't have struggled nearly as much to open the Ninth Door of his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor. By extension, if Leonel applied his higher pain threshold to other training methods, he could force his body to withstand much more than it previously could.\nThough the idea of suffering through pain and tempering one's will power sounded nice, this was something that could only appear in fantasy novels.\nThe human body had strict limits on the pain it could withstand for a reason. Going beyond these limits often meant the shutting down of one's body regardless of how much 'will power' you had. Pushing past these limits was often impossible, not for lack of will power, but simply due to lack of feasibility.\nAt the same time, however, these thresholds were often lower than they could be. This made sense, if one's body only shut down when at the very edge of breaking down, it might no longer be possible to pull back.\nBut, like this, Leonel would be able to use his own senses to look for his body's breaking point and choose a safe point to stop before then. This ultimately gave Leonel far more control over his own body.\nStill, the applications of this were far beyond just dulling pain.\nIf Leonel applied this skill to his Internal Sight, for example, he could make it several times more sensitive than it had been in the past. This could not only make his calculations more detailed and accurate, it would also be almost impossible for someone to slip by his senses.\nApplied in this way, Leonel could layer his vision to gain more details in a single look, he could layer his sense of touch to make his fingers more sensitive during Force Crafting, he could even layer his sense of taste to make food tastier if he so chose to.\nThe potential applications were almost endless.\nWhen Leonel realized this his mind seemed to implode. It wasn't with pain, but rather felt as though a door had been thrust open to him.\nLeonel sent all his focus into his arms, first separating his mind to control them independently then layering them once again to multiply this same control.\nThe instant he finished this, his finger speed hitched for a moment before it felt as though they broke past a barrier.\nHis movements became smoother and more fluid, his control over Little Tolly reaching unprecedented heights.\n'This is it… Superior Grade One Designation…'\nLeonel's hand coordination and speed had been stuck at Advanced Grade One designation for a long time. Thanks to his Metal Synergy Lineage Factor, he was effectively as good as someone who had already stepped into Superior Grade One designation, but it hadn't been a true breakthrough just yet… until just now.\nLooking down at his bloodied hands, orchestrating the movements of thin lines of silver like a conductor guiding a voluminous sonata, he couldn't help but laugh.\nThis feeling, he had never expected it to feel so good.\nLeonel's confidence shot through the roof. He finally felt as though his body could keep up with his mind.\nIt was almost as though his own body had become one of his familiars as well. He controlled it no differently than he took control of Little Tolly and Little Blackstar.\nThe two necklaces before Leonel seemed to magically and seamlessly fuse into two.\nIn the blink of an eye, Leonel completed a task he had spent several days on.\nThe Treading Goddess Necklace became more resplendent, exuding a silvery aura.\nWithout looking to the side, Leonel locked onto a Soul Type Ore from the Vein and Vessel piles.\nLeonel had already long since picked these two Ores out. If he wanted to give this necklace a sensory boost, this was the only way.\nThe Vessel Ore was known as Ghost Whispering Ore. It had the ability to continuously absorb and purify Force into Soul Force. It was born in places with exceptionally dark energy and due to this ability to 'create' Soul Force, it became known as the ghost Ore.\nThe Vein Ore was known as Soul Pulsing Ore. When fed an appropriate amount of Soul Force, it had the ability to amplify it. But, what made it so useful was the fact it was able to resonate with whoever marked it, thus effectively become an extension of this person's own Soul Force.\nDue to this Ore's sensitivity to souls and their resonance, it gave whoever fused with it an equally great sensitivity to the resonance of other Souls in proportion to how much Soul Force it was provided with.\nWhen these two Ores came together… The results were exponentially greater.\nBy Leonel's previous estimates, it would have taken him at least a weak to finish the integration of these two Ores without disrupting the balance of the remainder of the treasure. After all, the more moving parts a treasure had, the more complex it was and the more difficult it was to succeed in Crafting.\nYet, Leonel now felt a confidence he never had before. He felt as though the entire world was in his hands.\nThe communication between one's brain and their body was a limiting factor to everyone. This was why endless training was necessary to breakdown the body and force it to understand the tasks the brain wanted it to complete.\nBut, for the current Leonel, at least within certain limitations, he could control his body to the finest detail on the very first try.\nAll of his mental prowess was concentrated into his hands. As though each joint had become a node to be controlled at his whim, he took hold of his own body like it was a puppet on strings.\nBend to my will!",

      "content": "Leonel's right hand moved like the wind, wrapping around the Ghost Whispering Ore. At the same time, his left shot toward the Soul Pulsing Ore, working with complete independence.\nLeone's gaze stared out into blank space. It was as though his mind was completely wiped. It even felt like his eyes might roll back into their sockets at any moment. Yet, the speed of his hands didn't slow in the slightest.\nLeonel's right hand rapidly tapped at the Ghost Whispering Ore. Little Tolly raced across its surface causing it to spin rapidly and heat up even faster.\nSmokey impurities flew into the air and dripped down from the green Ore. It shrunk at a speed visible to the naked eye, falling from the size of a palm to the width of just a few fingernails.\nLeonel's left didn't stop. It stretched out at odd angles, causing Little Tolly to spread across the Soul Pulsing Ore's surface.\nVery quickly, the red Soul Pulsing Ore became an incredibly thin length of metal wrapped the entire way by Little Tolly's body. Yet, it seemed as though the thinness wasn't enough for Leonel as he continued to elongate the metal.\nFrom an Ore of barely two inches thick, the Soul Pulsing Ore became a thin line that stretched almost five meters.\nFinally satisfied, Leonel's left fingers twitched, causing the thin line to fold in on itself length wise, thus halving it to just over two meters.\nTo the naked eye, it seemed as though nothing had happened other than this. But, any sharp Force Crafters would be able to see that after folding it, Leonel used the added thickness he gained to roll the thin line into a thin tube.\nThe Ore ultimately became a fragile hollow tube that seemed capable of snapping in on its own weight at any moment. But, what happened next was truly magical.\nLittle Tolly, who had wrapped itself around the thin tube at Leonel's command, suddenly began to move.\nAt first it seemed as though the little guy was snapping the delicately constructed Ore in half, but it soon became clear that this wasn't the case at all.\nLittle Tolly began to bend and contort into an intricate shape. The more time passed, the more complex the structure became and the smaller size it seemed to shrink to.\nIt felt almost as though Leonel was constructing a miniature maze, hidden within the thin, gorgeous lines of the Soul Pulsing Ore. But, the reality was that he was constructing something much more miraculous than that.\nIn just an hour, the over two-meter-long tube had been sculpted into a small spiderweb of structures with a width of no more than half an inch. From afar, it looked like an oval gem. But, up close one could see that it was a maze of delicately forged lines.\nAs though by coincidence, the tempering of Leonel's Ghost Whispering Ore concluded at the exact same time. By now, it looked like nothing more than a flowing blue liquid, having lost its green color during the purification process.\nWithout a single pause, Leonel communicated with Little Tolliver to bring the thin blue liquid forward. Then, as though he was a madman… he controlled it to pour over the delicate red structure he had just formed.\nOne would think that with the heat difference, the red structure Leonel took so long to form was finished. The melting point of Ghost Whispering Ore was simply far higher than that of Soul Pulsing Ore, there shouldn't have been even a chance for it to survive.\nHowever… Little Tolly's body had yet to stop covering the delicate red structure.\nIn two parts, Leonel both controlled Little Tolly to protect the delicate maze while on another hand controlling the blue liquid to pour over it.\nThe blue substance wormed throughout the structure, sliding through impossibly small crevices with absolute ease.\nIf other Force Crafters saw Leonel now, they would be stunned to the point of speechlessness.\nSuch a process would usually be done in several steps. The easiest method would have been to split the structure into two molds before fusing them into one at the end. However, Leonel didn't take this approach at all despite it being the far easier option.\nThe reason for this was quite intuitive. When using two molds, it would be impossible to avoid imperfections. The only way to guarantee a sublime result would be to complete the gem in a single step. But, those who had the skill to do such things were simply too few.\nOne had to remember that most would never even reach the Advanced Grade One designation, let alone the Superior Grade One designation. In addition, those who could use Metal Spirits who were known for their ability to complete intricate Crafts were even fewer!\n…\nLeonel's vision regained his clarity and a sudden wave of fatigue slammed into him.\nHis mind spun and he collapsed to the ground, the skin of his hands peeling and dripping with blood.\nLeonel sent a glance toward the newly reforged Treading Goddess Necklace, a light smile creeping up on his lips.\nHe modified it so that Aina could wear it as a head piece again. It looked much less flashy than it did in the past and the only exotic thing about it was the purple gem that hung from its center. But, Leonel was greatly satisfied. He felt that his skill had reached a new level.\n\"Hey dictionary, scan this treasure for me.\"\n[*Ping*]\n[Treasure: Unnamed]\n[Abilities]\n[Minor Teleportation: Instant teleportation within three meters once every three seconds. Has enough stores to save up for two charges]\n[Force Skin: At full charge, capable of withstanding three strikes of a Pseudo Fifth Dimensional entity]\n[Sensory Boost: Increase sensitivity and range of Internal Sight by a factor of three]\n[Grade: Elite Quasi Bronze]\nLeonel grinned. 'This should be a good birthday present, right?'\nOther than the fact the teleportation charges had fallen from three to two from the original Treading Goddes Necklace, everything else was perfect.\nLeonel still remembered those emotions that ran through him when Miles and Simeon almost killed the two of them. Back then, he had greatly regretted not giving Aina the defensive treasure he had chosen for her earlier.\n'Her birthday is just a few weeks away, I'll give it to her then.' Leonel thought with a smile.\nAfter thinking this, Leonel became serious once more.\nOriginally, he had expected it to take him at least a month to complete Aina's present. By the time he finished, he believed he would have the skill he needed to built the Crafts he had in mind. But, he never expected for him to have a breakthrough and ultimately take less than a month.\nBut, this was even better. Now, he could begin immediately.\nThough his body was tired, Leonel's mind was still sharp. He felt an endless energy coming from his Dream World. He felt as long as his mind was awake, the state of his body meant little.\n'[Grand Heal].'\nLeonel was showered with blinding Light Elemental Force, the injuries to his hands repairing at impossible speeds.\n'Let's start…'",

Hoho, feel free to ignore big sis if it's inconvenient to—.\"\nBefore Mordred could finish her words, the door to the room opened.\nMordred's words were caught in her throat as she blinked speechlessly.\nAina stood before her with an equally questioning glance. It had already been more than a week since they came here, but this was the first time someone had come to check on Aina. Well, aside from the usual delivery of food that came every so often.\nCamelot wasn't clear on Aina's strength while King Arthur believed that Leonel wasn't quite strong enough to make a big difference either.\nThough King Arthur had battled and lost to Leonel before, those circumstances were quite special. Back then, due to his pride, he fell into Leonel's rhythm and tried to compete with him in speed casting.\nObjectively speaking, back then, if Leonel had to battle either Mordred or King Arthur, it would have been a difficult and long fight even after grasping the Winter Realm with his bow. This was how much strength these two legends had.\nHad King Arthur been more level headed back then, Leonel wouldn't have been able to make such a fool out of him. This much should have been clear by the fact that, despite the optics of it all, Arthur came out of their battle completely unscathed.\nAnd now, King Arthur had finally crossed the barrier he had stalled at for so many years.\nThis wasn't all either… Because now, the people of Camelot were considered to be people of Earth. As the world evolved, the people of Camelot, too, began to awaken to their own abilities.\nThis was all to say that the King Arthur of now was by far and away stronger than the version of himself Leonel would have already struggled mightily to defeat. So, despite the fact that Leonel had grown since then as well, he was unlikely to last a few exchanges with the current King Arthur even now…\nSo, it made sense that no one had come to communicate with Aina and Leonel. In their minds, what difference could these two children possibly make?\nThe only person who knew that it was inadvisable to underestimate Leonel was Mordred and this was because she knew everything about him, even secrets he had never exposed to another before.\nBut, there was one interesting thing about that trial that Mordred hadn't told Leonel about…\nBack then, the first part of the trial was a test of sifting through information. It took some time for Leonel to realize that the 'main character' of his trial was actually Mordred and not someone else.\nMordred, of course, had to deal with this same issue. But, compared to Leonel, she had a much harder time deciphering the truth.\nThis wasn't only because Leonel had an ability conducive to such analysis while she did not, but it was because it almost felt as though Leonel's life had not one… but two main characters to it.\nAnd the other character? It was exactly this young girl before her.\nWhen Mordred laid eyes on Aina, a welling of almost motherly sympathy burst out from her heart.\n\"You poor girl, you have to treat yourself better. Your scars have flared up again.\"\nAina flinched when she heard these words and involuntarily took a step back.\nUnlike Leonel who had been there, she wasn't aware why Mordred would somehow know so much about her.\nSaying that her scars had flared up would be a simple observation for anyone. But, to say 'again' so familiarly… why did it feel like Mordred knew this wasn't the first time this had happened?\nAina's scars had, indeed, been inflamed once again. In fact, they had a raging violet redness to them that was even more severe than when Leonel had seen them at their worst.\nAfter using the cleansing waters, they had calmed and appeared like normal scars. Though they were still ever present, they looked like normal knife wounds. But now, they looked like they had been infested by a nasty infection once again.\nHaving seen almost as much of Aina's life as she had seen of Leonel's, Mordred knew well that Aina's scars only flared up like this when she used them to facilitate her training.\nMordred sighed seeing Aina's reaction. She too felt that she was a bit too rash with her words. Aina had no idea that she had seen most of her life as well.\n\"… May I come in?\" Mordred asked.\nBy now, Mordred was certain that Leonel wasn't present.\n'Damned boy, how can you be so bad with women? She's clearly in a distressed state yet you've gone off and disappeared.'\nAs much as Mordred knew about Aina's life, she knew even more about Leonel's. She knew how easily he detached himself. Whether it came to his mother or James, she didn't think that anything would change when it came to Aina either.\nUnfortunately, Leonel might have high emotional intelligence, but even he couldn't be perfect. He still had some things to learn, it seemed.\n\"Mm.\" Aina nodded.\nMordred sighed. \"Come, come. Let's get you an ice pack, I'm sure that this can't feel very good.\"\nAina wasn't sure why she allowed Mordred to enter, truthfully. Despite Mordred's talks of an ice pack, Aina never mentioned the fact Leonel's cleansing waters could likely heal her back to her previous state.\n\"Em, I want to fight.\" Aina suddenly said.\n\"Fight?\" Mordred was stunned.\n\"Yes, I want to join the battlefield. But, I wasn't sure who to talk to, so I've been waiting here.\"\n\"This…\"\nMordred hesitated. She was hoping to help Aina out a bit, maybe spend some time with the young girl. After all, if there was anyone who understood what it felt like to be alone, it was Mordred.\nBut, something about it made her realize that it was almost too difficult to say no to this girl. It looked as though if she said no, Aina would go off on her own to find her own battles.\nThinking back to the scenes Mordred had seen of Aina's life, Mordred could only grit her teeth and agree.\n'… The last time that monster came out of her, she and Leonel were in that 'French' Zone. I need to be there if it happens again…'",

      "content": "Though it might seem isolated, news of the war between Earth and Terrain spread like a wildfire throughout the universe.\nIt could be said that a world wasn't truly considered to be a part of the Dimensional Verse until it entered the Fourth Dimension. But, Earth in specific was wildly eyed by powerful entities due to its potential.\nIt was exactly because of this that war between two mere Fourth Dimensional worlds had suddenly become such a hot topic.\nThe truth was that though Earth was favored, it was the world itself that was, not its people. Who cared which citizens populated it as long as the world existed? In fact, many other Fourth Dimensional worlds were quite jealous of Terrain.\nThe truth was that Terrain was the only Fourth Dimensional world close enough to execute such a war plan. It wasn't by coincidence that Leonel and Aina could reach with a single talisman.\nThese words peeled back the requirements for such an invasion to succeed.\nFirstly, two worlds had to exist on the same plane. It would be almost impossible for a Fifth Dimensional world or above to accomplish such a thing. Or, more accurately, the price they would need to pay to do this wouldn't be worth it. This was also why Terrain needed to wait until Earth evolved.\nThe second requirement was closeness. The universe was too vast, it would be impossible for another Fourth Dimensional world from a wildly different quadrant to even dream of attacking Earth.\nTerrain happened to meet both of these requirements and now its actions were a hotly discussed topic.\nBut, while most of the universe was just observing curiously, there was a group of people that was infuriated: the Powers of Terrain.\nIf there was one group of people that was completely caught off guard by this, even more than the people of Earth, it was these Powers. In one moment, they were negotiating terms to sell themselves to a higher power, and in the next moment, half the value of their world was plundered and taken.\n\"Who's going to explain to me how this happened?!\"\nA thunderous roar shook Cliff's Edge Terrace.\n\"Stop all your yelling, is that going to get us anywhere.\"\n\"What did you say to me? Don't forget this is my territory, woman.\"\n\"Call me 'woman' one more time and I'll peel your tongue out from your lips. Care to try me?\"\n\"Alright, alright. This isn't getting us anywhere. You're only wasting more time.\"\n\"Tsk, we should have known they were planning something like this.\"\n\"It was obvious that they were planning something, but attacking Earth takes some balls. I didn't think that they'd have the guts to do it.\"\nThree individuals gathered. The male with a booming voice was the Head of Cliff's Edge Terrace, Head Solar. The woman was the Head of Mirage Pavilion, Head Mirage. And, the mediator of the two was the Head of World's End Falls, Head Falls.\n\"That's exactly what doesn't make any sense. Who gave them the guts? Do they have any idea how many hidden allies Earth has? Do they have any idea how many other powers are eyeing Earth? Do they have a death wish?\"\n\"It seems like you're still the same idiot.\" Head Mirage sneered, her cherry lips parting in disdain.\n\"What did you say to me?!\"\n\"Just think for a minute, blockhead. You think those people care about the people of Earth? Do you think there's such kindness in this world?\"\n\"The talents of Earth only come from those born on Earth. And, even then, it isn't as though one can just go to a powerful world to birth a child and manifest a talent, or else everyone would do it! Obviously, the people of Earth are worth more than the people of our world even if we started popping out babies over there right this second!\"\n\"You idiot, do you think you're the only one that knows that? Since you're still not getting it, I'll try to speak extra slowly.\"\nHead Falls rubbed his temples and shook his head. But in the end, he couldn't be bothered to stop their bickering again.\n\"A first generation child is a baby which doesn't have a single parent from the world. They will gain at most a 20% blessing from the world and won't be gifted with all of its potential. The remaining 80% will come from where the baby's parents originated.\n\"If the baby has at least one first generation parent, they will receive 50% of the world's blessing and will be considered a second-generation child. This will be the same even if both parents are first generation, the percentages will not change.\n\"If the baby has at least one second generation parent, they will receive 80% of the world's blessing. Once again, this will be the same even if both parents are second generation.\n\"If the baby has at least one third generation parent, they will receive 90%. At fourth generation, it will be 95%. And, with a parent at the fifth generation, the baby will finally be considered a full blown native.\n\"It's at fourth generation where things change. At that stage, if both parents are fourth generation, then their baby will receive 100% of the world's blessing and also be considered a full native.\n\"Do you understand now?\"\nBy this point, Head Solar wanted to explode. Did he look like a child? How could he not know these things? In fact, one of the most important things for a world to grasp after entering the Fourth Dimension and truly becoming a part of the Dimensional Verse was how to differentiate between immigrants and natives.\nThere was no small number of people who wanted to take advantage of more talented worlds. In fact, even Terrain had to deal with this, let alone Earth.\n\"Do you really think I don't understand any of this?!\"\n\"Clearly you don't!\" Head Mirage snapped. \"Our world is the only one in position to launch attacks from Earth for the foreseeable future. By the time any other worlds can come in and taste a piece of the pie, do you really think five generations wouldn't have passed by then?!\n\"That's not even to mention the fact that there are plenty of fifth generation people on Earth right now! What's stopping them from being used like studs and sows?!\"\nHead Solar froze.\nIt seemed that this situation was far different from what he had imagined.",

      "content": "Head Solar calmed his rage and took a deep breath.\n\"So they're just taking a risk for a chance at survival? Fifth Dimensional worlds are much more common than Fourth Dimensional worlds. The number that would be in position to attack them is far more. Who's to say that with Earth's talent they'd even be able to establish themselves before they suffered the same fate?\"\nThough it was somewhat counter intuitive, after some thought it made more sense.\nIt was best to consider the universe like a bell curve. It wasn't necessarily so that weaker worlds were more common.\nWith the age of the Dimensional Verse, many worlds had had time to reach their potential. Due to the structure of things, the average talent of worlds was the Fifth Dimension. As such, the vast majority of worlds in the Dimensional Verse were within the Fifth Dimension.\nLikewise, the number of worlds within the Fifth Dimension that could attack Earth were likewise much more.\nIf the Cities won this war, how long would they get to enjoy it? A few decades at most? With Earth's potential, they likely wouldn't even need a century to cross yet another Dimensional barrier.\n\"In fact, their situation is even worse than that.\" Head Solar sneered, suddenly thinking of something. \"Even if they really used Earth's people like sows and studs, it would take years for those children to mature. In the meantime, would they have the talent necessary to ensure that Earth wasn't swallowed by spacetime?\"\nTalent was a double-edged sword. Though better talents would be born in such a world, their Zones were likewise more difficult and appeared more frequently as well. If those Cities failed to clear the Zones, Earth could very well be swallowed up.\nHead Falls sighed.\n\"Your words aren't wrong, but only partially. I'm sure you remember what happened in Brave City this time, right?\"\nHead Solar froze again.\n\"The Heir of the Kaefir family was accepted as a disciple of Valiant Heart Mountain. It's with this added layer of protection that they dare to do this.\"\nHead Solar frowned. \"But doesn't Earth have that Leonel child?\"\nHe heard from his son that there was a Leonel character who was accepted without even having to go through the trials. Wasn't Leonel's standing even higher than Anared's? How could this even count as protection.\n\"Yes, I've heard this as well. But, this protection is only useful if two conditions are met. The first is that they have to be worlds that Valiant Heart Mountain can directly act against.\n\"Secondly, they have to have officially joined and have to have high standing.\n\"Not only has this Leonel child not officially joined, but Earth's attackers are members of the Fourth Dimension. This is not something Valiant Heart Mountain can interfere in.\"\nHead Solar sighed, slumping into his chair. Higher dimensional worlds couldn't interfere even if they wanted to. Not only would the price be high, but there were unspoken rules to think of. Wars between lower level worlds were usually observed with one eye closed and another open by these behemoths.\nOnly when the threats were of the Fifth Dimension would Valiant Heart Mountain begin to have some deterrence.\n\"They're banking on the Keafir family Heir joining in a few years and climbing up the disciple ranks?\"\n\"… If only it were so simple.\" Head Falls sighed once again. \"I have reason to believe that the Keafir family Heir's success has little to do with what benefits Valiant Heart Mountain can provide and much more about what his fiancée's family can…\"\nAt this point, even Head Mirage who had long since grasped everything sat up.\n\"What do you know?\" She asked straight forwardly.\n\"It's only my speculation…\"\n\"Just speak, stop beating about the bush.\" Head Solar pressed.\nThey both knew about Head Falls' ability. If there were any deductions he could make, they would likely be very close to the truth.\nIn reality, it was mostly because of this that they were caught off guard by things. They were so used to Head Falls seeing through everything in advance that they never even suspected what might happen. Now, they had been caught with their pants down.\nHead Falls took a deep breath.\n\"The appearance of Young Miss Heira is too mysterious. No one knows where she comes from, what strength she possesses, or what her goals are. All we know is that she is the fiancée to the Keafir family Heir, nothing more, nothing less.\n\"I contacted Shield Cross Stars to hopefully find out some information about her, but my contacts weren't able to get anything back to me.\"\nThe expression of the two Heads changed.\nThis realization didn't mean that Heira's standing was above Shield Cross Stars. This was almost impossible. After all, Shield Cross Stars was considered to be the police of the universe. There were few if any Powers that could ignore their influence.\nWhat this truly meant was that Head Falls' contacts weren't able to get him the information he needed. Simply put, their clearance wasn't high enough.\nThis meant at least one thing for sure: Heira wasn't from a world weaker than the Fifth Dimension.\n\"However, they did let slip one thing. According to them, a notice for fugitives was put out. Suspicious entities in all Fourth Dimensional worlds within this Star Alignment were all marked with monitoring brands. But, most importantly… This order was requested by Young Miss Heira herself.\n\"As for what this means in totality, I'm not sure. But… It for certain means that this young lady has the influence or, at the very least, the net worth necessary to accomplish such a thing.\"\nHead Solar's brows furrowed. \"What are you trying to get at? I feel you mean something more by telling us how potentially powerful she is, correct?\"\n\"Yes… Don't you think it's odd that not to mention the fact the two haven't gotten married, but they haven't even set a date for their wedding yet? Almost like… Almost like the Kaefir family Heir still hasn't proved himself yet?\n\"So, what kind of status would he gain once he did gain such acknowledgement? What if this acknowledgement is more important than any backing Valiant Heart Mountain could ever provide?\"\nThe two Heads sucked in a cold breath before a deathly silence fell over the room.\n\"Then… What should we do?\" Head Mirage was the one to finally break the silence.\nHead Falls didn't answer for a long while. For a moment, the two thought that he might never respond at all. But, when he finally did speak, they felt a swirl of complex emotions were surging within them.\n\"… As things stand now, Earth still has a chance to defend itself. Though they're feeling the pressure, it isn't to the point their loss is guaranteed…\n\"… As the saying goes, delivering coal in the winter is better than delivering water to an already smothered flame. What chance would Earth stand if instead of half our world's strength, it faced the entire brunt?\"\n…\nHead Falls left the meeting of Powers with a smirk on his face, a sharp glint lighting his eye.",

      "content": "Royal Blue Fort.\nThe atmosphere was heated. The amount of pressure placed on the Fort itself wasn't as great as one would have expected. At the very least, the colonists of Earth's two moons and the citizens of the Capital were under far greater stress.\nThe reason for this was obvious, but also placed the members of the Fort in a terrible situation all the same.\nUnlike the Capital which had been revitalized and truly looked like a Province once again, Royal Blue Province was still mostly in shambles. The only location of proper society was the Fort… So why would the people of Terrain bother to attack right away?\nFor different situations, different tactics were required. Camelot was a small terrain and mostly inhabited. As such, White City launched a full assault from the very beginning.\n[Author's Note: From now on, whenever Camelot is mentioned, assume it's in reference to Earth's second moon unless the context says otherwise]\nHowever, Royal Blue Province was now mostly untouched territory. Other than the Fort itself, the rest was just collapsed buildings, Invalids, beasts, and the occasional outcast gang that overestimated themselves.\nLeonel had met such an outcast gang in the moments before he entered the Joan Zone. But, he had dealt with them quite easily in his rage due to their grotesque remarks about Aina.\nThese outcasts were fools who thought they would be able to avoid the hand of The Empire when things finally settled down, when in reality they would likely be among the first killed when things truly reached that point.\nBut now, to the people of Terrain, these outcasts had become a hot commodity.\nSince Earth was such a new world, most of its original citizens, by default, were within the Fifth Generation and beyond. This made every Earthener the people of Terrain ran across a hotly contested item…\nYes, item. Not person.\nThis situation left the people of Earth in an odd limbo.\nThe Capital was under a full blown assault and unable to lend out help, while the rest of Earth's land was being rapidly colonized.\nThe only way to stop this would be to send out armies from the Forts to slow them down. But, how could these nobles that had just turtled themselves up dare to make a move so easily? They continued to cower within their walls, waiting for someone else to take action.\nAfter all, with the death of Miles, they could just pretend that they didn't have proper direction. Then, everything would fall on the shoulders of the Governor Duke or the Secretary Marquisette. They wouldn't have to take any responsibility whatsoever.\nThis was the harsh reality that peace could bring about. The sharpness The Empire that once swept through Earth had, had dulled considerably.\nWhile there were no pushovers amongst nobles, it was also because of this that none of them wanted to rashly make a move.\nWhat if their sacrifice benefited another? How could they guarantee that their credit would be their own and not that of someone else's?\nThis situation led to the Fort closing its dome once again. As for the commoners on the outside… did they need to care for them?\nBut, it was in exactly this situation that the large oak doors to the gathering of nobles opened.\nA deathly silence fell. The number of people who dared to do such a thing were simply too few. And, since it was unlikely to be a person of The Capital, it was pretty clear to them all who this person was.\nAs expected, the clicking of heels reverberated through the quiet congressional hall.\nA beauty strolled in, her hips swinging like a hypnotic pendulum. It didn't seem like she had done it on purpose, but rather that innate charm exuded from her very pores.\nDespite the fact they all knew she had been an old hag just a year prior, the men within the room couldn't help but feel their loins light on fire.\nWho else could this person be if not Secretary Marquisette Maia? After another long disappearance, she had finally come back once again.\nAs though nothing had changed, she easily sat at the helm of the hall, not feeling as though there was anything wrong in the slightest.\nOne of the nobles frowned.\n\"Secretary Marquisette, this isn't appropriate.\"\nAs a Chief Earl, the chief law officer of Royal Blue Province, there were few who knew the law better than Chief Earl Fiel. The position of one's seating was highly important to setting precedential hierarchy.\nBut, Maia now sat in a position reserved for the Governor Duke. Even Miles hadn't been allowed to do this. In fact, Miles couldn't sit at any one of the leadership positions.\nMaia didn't respond directly. She only dug into her bosom and pulled out a noble crest.\nWith a single look, any one of them could recognize it. Those rushing waters, the strong shield that blocked them from the lush grounds to its back.\nThere was no doubt, this was the Leum family's crest.\nChief Earl Fiel sat back down silently. There was already nothing more to say.\n\"… In my absence, it seems that you all have had quite a bit of fun to yourselves, hm?\" Maia said lightly.\nThe nobles remained silent. They couldn't understand how this woman who so rarely appeared still wielded so much power. Just how did she do it?\n\"It seems that you all have forgotten what it means to be the nobles of the Ascension Empire. You all have felt too comfortable for too long.\n\"His Majesty, Emperor Fawkes, has ordered a Code Black Martial Law state, effective immediately.\"\nAt that moment, the nobles who had managed to maintain their cool shot out from their seats, shock coloring their features.\nA Code Black state? Wasn't that too rash? Such a state could only be called upon when The Empire was in danger of falling, but they were still very far from this future. What the hell was going on?\nOf course, this was only a very small part of why they were all so shocked.\nCode Black Martial Law had the fewest laws and restrictions of any state. But, it had one very important clause that shook the nobles to their core.\nIn such a state, everything was earned by merits. When it concluded and everything returned to normal, even their very own noble positions would be up for grabs and exchangeable for merits…\nEven the title of Grand Prime Minister or even Prince could be exchanged for!\nAs for those who didn't have enough merits....? They would lose the noble seats they spent so much of their time protecting.",

      "content": "\"From now on I will be in charge.\"\nSecretary Marquisette Maia's demeanor completely shifted. From a coquettish, seductive air, the atmosphere around her became oppressive and heavy. It felt as though she had become a completely different person. No… It was like she had gone back to being that old hag of over a year ago…\n\"First, the scouting missions will be ramping up. I want anyone with speed, concealment and sensory abilities to be inserted in a reconnaissance unit effective immediately. The only exceptions I will allow are those in commanding roles.\n\"All Tier 5 Admirals will be responsible for securing a ten kilometer coastal buffer. The ocean has been ruled by beasts for too long, how useless are you all for allowing this to continue?\n\"All Tier 5 Generals will be in rotating vanguard positions. I don't want there to be a single moment in any single day where there is not any pressure being applied on these jumping monkeys of Terrain. How long do you intend to allow them to gallivant on our turf? Is this what being a noble means to you?\n\"General Umbred, General Sater, General Tudo. Consider yourselves demoted. Your replacements will be the new General Milan, General Raj and General Joel.\"\n\"What?!\"\nGeneral Umbred stood in a rage, his mustache furiously blowing in all his anger.\n\"Sit down.\"\nUmbred felt a cold shiver course through his veins. He met Maia's cold gaze, completely unable to stop his body from trembling.\n\"While you were holing yourself up in the safety of this dome, those three led a vanguard against the Invalid tide. Yet, you still dare to call yourself a general and even raise your voice toward me? Who do you think you are?\n\"I sentence you to three years in Dark Cloud prison. Take him away.\"\nUmbred froze in shock, he couldn't believe what he was hearing.\nDark Cloud prison wasn't a death sentence for himself, but it was most definitely one for his career.\nHe couldn't believe what was happening. He didn't even know who this Milan person replacing him was, nor did he know a Joel or Raj. All he knew was they had to be commoners because the only ones who would have led a vanguard against that Invalid tide were those with no standing.\nAll he had done was follow the lead of everyone else, yet he was suffering the most. Even worse, because he couldn't control his temper, he ended up in an even worse position than the other two.\nSeeing such a scene, former General Sater and Tudo didn't even dare to breathe too heavily. They could only watch with sunken expressions as Umbred was escorted out of the hall, his expression dark as could be.\nNo one who had a criminal record was allowed to hold a government position above Tier 3. Umbred was finished and the legacy his family had built to now had all come crumbling down just with a few words.\n\"Do you all really think I don't know what's been happening in my absence?? This sort of dereliction of duty will not be tolerated. Every offender will receive a more damning sentence than the last. The next person to step out of line will receive five years, the next ten. Don't try my patience.\"\nMaia continued as though nothing had happened, listing off her commands.\nThe more the nobles listened, the more they realized that Maia had ears everywhere. Every one of her new laws of order was pointed at a very particular problem that was almost impossible to? notice on a whim.\nThe more she spoke, the more the nobles felt their hearts tighten. They sat up straighter, their demeanor becoming several levels more respectful.\nAt the same time, they began to look toward one another with wary gazes. The only way Maia could have managed this was if she had informants. But, it was impossible to tell who they were, it left them all on the edge of their seats. They had no idea who had been secretly observing them all.\nAs clever men and women used to the world of politics, they tried to pay attention to who Maia put in positions of power, trying to see if they could deduce who to be wary of in the future. But, the more they tried to deduce, the more frustrated they became.\nThe only obvious promotion Maia handed out was to those three commoners. The rest were either inconsequential or didn't change much at all. It left them all in a state of limbo, as though they were suspended above an abyss they could fall to the bottom of at any time.\nIf they didn't know Maia was doing this on purpose by now, they wouldn't be worth the noble titles they had.\nWith this kind of perpetual pressure, which of them would dare to step out of line?\n\"… Finally, reorganize the inner city and make room for the commoners to enter. Level the outer city and repurpose the steel walls for some more practical defenses.\"\nThe nobles felt like cleaning out their ears. What did Maia say just now? Allow the commoners in?\nMaia's words were final. She didn't even bother to explain herself from start to finish. She never gave a reason for anything, but deep inside, the nobles knew exactly why she made every decision. This was the only one they couldn't quite wrap their minds around.\nBut, Maia didn't give some heartfelt speech about the importance of the people to convince them. She simply left her words behind and swayed her hips to leave.\nInternally, Maia giggled.\n'Consider this a repayment of your favor, Leonel. You helped me gain the foothold I wanted in the Slayer Legion and now I've reformed Royal Blue Fort to your ideals. Be sure to put in a good word for me to your gramps.'\nMaia smiled lightly, her mind spinning at speeds that could rival even Leonel's.\nAs for what her plans and goals were, maybe only Maia herself knew this.\n'Ah!' Maia suddenly sped up her steps. 'Don't worry, mommy's coming.'\nMaia happily sashayed away. She really didn't like being away from her child. Even though the doctors swore the incubator was top of the line, she still preferred to oversee it all personally.\n**\nOn Camelot.\n\"Oh, Khaled is dead?\"\n---\n[Author's Note below 17/12/21]",

      "content": "One would think that such a report would have landed on City Lord White's desk a long time ago. However, the City Lord wasn't the type of woman who enjoyed listening to reports on what she deemed as useless points. All she cared about was the result.\nNot only had the Lin Barony fallen, but it had fallen within the time frame she had set. The number of soldiers she had lost were less important to her than the tasks they managed to complete.\nThis might sound like a maddening philosophy to have, even to the point where it dehumanized one's own subordinates, and even worse, could be seen as foolish, but it was clear that City Lord White didn't care about the optics of such things.\nIn the end, the result was an odd situation where City Lord White only learned about the passing of one of her White Knights over a week later.\nNiya nodded. \"Yes, City Lord. He died along with 511 Predator Ravens. During the siege of the Lin and Pervaux Baronies, we lost 37 of our 1022 men before managing to claim their territory.\n\"Soldier Kopp took over White Knight Diore's position and has been taking control of the law and order of the troops.\"\nCity Lord White waved a hand. \"Why are you telling me all of this?\"\nNiya didn't seem surprised the City Lord White didn't care about all these details. In truth, she wanted to be out on the battlefield herself, but this was a war where White City was just a single gear in a working system. She couldn't do as she pleased. She had to follow the plans laid out by the Keafir family.\nThis left her feeling quite antsy and irritable. She only managed to keep things together since it was Niya who was speaking. If it was anyone else, they likely would have tasted 'Clara' by now.\nAnd, the only reason Niya had such a pass wasn't because City Lord White allowed nonsense from her. Rather, it was because the City Lord was aware that Niya knew better than to waste her time. So, if Niya was bringing this up, it meant she had a very good reason to do so.\nThere was a reason Niya was the only one allowed to be so near the City Lord so consistently.\n\"According to a report sent by acting commander Kopp, White Knight Diore lost in single combat at the hands of a child by the name of Leonel Morales.\"\nCity Lord White's annoyed expression faded and she looked up at Niya.\nNiya nodded once again despite the fact City Lord White hadn't actually spoken any words.\n\"There are three things that we have to pay great attention to during this war. The first is the interference of the hidden families. The second is the interference of Higher Dimensional worlds. And lastly, we have to pay particular attention to the wielders of the World Spirit.\n\"According to what is known, the second, third and fourth completers have well known identities. However, the first completer has yet to be found.\n\"According to our intelligence and deductions, there are three individuals who have the potential to be the first completer. One of these individuals is expressly this Leonel Morales.\"\nCity Lord White slowly stood.\nThe World Spirit, even in comparison to the interference of Higher Dimensional worlds, was the greatest potential variable of this world.\nThe good news was that the World Spirit should have been split into four parts. When in such a parsed situation, the abilities of the World Spirit were significantly nerfed to the point of practically having no use. This in addition to the fact the abilities of World Spirits were quite infantile at the early stages of such a world and it wouldn't be a large problem even if it was whole.\nHowever, the World Spirit is what truly decided sovereignty over a world. Terrain had to ensure to grasp at least one of these four portions. Only by doing so would they be able to truly lay claim to this world.\n\"Also, though she is not among the most likely three I just mentioned, there is intelligence that Aina Brazinger is currently present on the battlefields. From our intelligence, she has a very close relationship with Leonel Morales. So, although she's unlikely to have been the first completer, getting to her would be valuable, regardless.\"\n\"Why'd you wait so long to bring such information to me?! I finally get to set out!\"\n\"City Lord, wait!\" Niya raised her voice slightly so that City Lord White didn't just storm off. If this short-haired woman caught a head of steam, it would be almost impossible to stop her.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"It isn't appropriate to make a move just yet. Our original plan didn't account for The Empire already having a presence on this moon already. But, it seems that before we appeared, The Empire had already sent Prince Noah Fawkes here to lead an army to assimilate Camelot and the Demon Empire.\"\n\"Noah Fawkes, isn't that?\"\n\"Yes, the third completer, Prince Noah Fawkes.\"\n\"Isn't that even better. That means there are two potential World Spirit pieces here.\"\n\"While this is true, it also means that we have to be careful. Prince Fawkes has already begun to lead a counterattack and we've already lost half of the territory we initially snatched due to poor foundations.\"\n\"Isn't that just more reason for me to go? Why are you wasting my time?\"\nCity Lord White's expression darkened.\n\"Yes, it is important that you go, but not so that you can target Leonel Morales. We need to prepare a proper counterattack and sweep through Camelot in a single sweep.\n\"I suggest that you wait for us to turn Lin and Pervaux Baronies into proper launch points.\n\"Both are important resources. Lin Barony is a choke point that separates the Kingdom from the wilderness. This doesn't seem like a big deal, but it's perfect for starving them of natural resources whether that be wood or fresh water.\n\"Pervaux Barony forms the final point of a triangle between Lin Barony and Camelot and is a final barrier to the no-man's land that separates Camelot and the Demon Empire. It's a perfect launch point to attack both the Demon Empire and the Kingdom.\n\"We will secure the supply lines, cut off Camelot's resources, and create a perfect foundation for attack. Then you can move out, City Lord.\"\nCity Lord White stared at Niya deeply for a moment before sitting back down.\n\"How much time?\"\n\"Two months at the fastest, three at the latest.\"\n\"Fine.. I'll let them live for a little longer, then.\"",

      "content": "The people of Terrain had no idea that the World Spirit hadn't been separated into four like it would on other worlds. In Earth's case, a rare instance to be sure, the World Spirit chose its host before the Metamorphosis began.\nBut, somehow, this news was kept as a complete secret. Even after years of preparation, Terrain was completely unaware.\nThat said, could they be blamed? A Fourth Dimensional world with limited talent and scope like Terrain wasn't even aware that a World Spirit could make such autonomous decisions at such an early stage.\nDue to the fact they weren't aware, they weren't even looking for it before Earth's Metamorphosis began. As the saying went… you didn't know what you didn't know. How could Terrain be aware of something they weren't even aware they should be aware about in the first place?\nAfter the Metamorphosis began, Terrain used special channels to learn about who the four completers were. Through their investigations, they managed to learn about three of them, the third completer of which was Prince Noah Fawkes…\nOf course, no one was aware of the fact that due to him waking up so much earlier than everyone else, Leonel was by far the first to complete a Zone. In fact, the time difference was a staggering several month gap.\nIf it wasn't for the fact Leonel was injured to the point of falling into a coma and having to be nursed back to health by Uncle Montez, he would have exited long before anyone else and his status as the first completer would have been more obvious to all.\nBut, for now… others could only speculate about his identity.\nStill, even then, Leonel's performance was so dazzling that he had become a prime suspect regardless.\n**\nPrince Noah Fawkes stood tall on a battlefield, his breathing almost too even. It was difficult to tell that he had just been in a battle to begin with.\nDespite the fact the corpses of his enemies laid before him, their blood dripping from the blade of his saber, he didn't seem happy in the slightest.\n\"They're stalling.\"\nNoah spoke to no one in particular.\nThis White City was exceptionally cruel. Without thought for casualties, they threw army after army of troops at them. It was as though they wanted them to waste time cutting them all down like they were weeds to be disgusted by rather than people.\nIn truth, Noah was indifferent to it all. He just didn't like what it could possibly mean. Since they were stalling, there had to be a purpose for it. So, what was that purpose, exactly?\nAt that moment, an agile black wolf of over three meters tall shot to Noah's side. In one instant, it was as swift as the wind and in the next it came to a grinding halt without warning. It was as though it had never been running to begin with.\nA petite young woman with short hair swooped down from the top of the wolf.\n\"Your Highness, it may be time to begin to coordinate with Camelot and the Demon Empire. It's clear that they've prepared for a long time and know more about us than we do them. Though we've won all of our battles, they're hollow victories.\"\nJessica spoke as plainly as she always did.\nIt had already been a month since Noah had a conversation with his grandfather. In that time, he had managed to reclaim over half the territory White City had taken from Camelot, but there were a few problems with this.\nFor one, technology wasn't functioning as it once had. Without it, it wasn't possible to erect Forts like they had on Earth with any sort of speed. So, though they had 'reclaimed' the land, it was more like they had pushed out White City's presence.\nSecondly, White City had managed to keep a strict hold of two strategic points even to now.\nThough they lost battles without a care, they always managed to keep control over what was truly important.\nThirdly, they hadn't originally come here for such a long, drawn-out war.\nThanks to their skills, food and water wasn't a problem, but there was more than this one needed for war.\nThey needed a steady supply of weapons and weapon maintenance options, which they didn't have. They needed healers and doctors, but they were in short supply of them. And, they needed numbers in order to keep control and scout out the areas they had taken hold of.\nBut, they had none of these things.\nDue to this, Noah had hoped to make a strong push and place White City on its backfoot as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, though he succeeded, the issue was that their success wasn't great enough to warrant any sort of happiness. It was essentially hollow.\nNoah nodded. \"I agree. I believe we've displayed enough of our strength.\"\nWith a shake of his wrist, a strong vibration shot through Noah's blue bladed saber. His strength caused the metal to bend and groan, whipping the blood on its away. In an instant, the blade was once again spotless.\n\"Should we arrange a meeting?\"\n\"No. We will meet on the battlefield.\" Noah said plainly.\n\"Understood.\"\n**\nWhile Noah was leading attacks toward Pervaux Barony, heading a charge from the direction of no-man's land, Camelot and the Demon Empire was heading a charge toward Lin Barony.\nYet, despite this pincer attack from both sides, White City continued to fend off their attempts.\nThe dauntless approach of the soldiers of White City shook the knights and mages of Camelot to the core. To be so fearless in death, even after so many battles, wore on the souls of their enemies, making them feel as though this was a battle they would never win.\nAs a result, despite the fact King Arthur had been experiencing maybe the most peaceful time of his life, it was overshadowed by a perpetual fog that hung over Camelot.\nWhat didn't help was the fact Camelot lacked the same level of organization White City's armies did. And, as their knights and mages awakened to their new abilities, it made the battlefield even more chaotic than they should have been.\nWithout proper guidance on how to use these suddenly newfound powers, Camelot's victories were even more pyrrhic than Noah's had been…\nIt was on this day, on yet another battlefield, that Aina could be found, her lips tightly sealed as she swung her great sword toward another enemy.",

      "content": "Aina felt her arms trembling on impact. She could see the indifferent eyes of the White City soldier through their crossed blades. However, despite the dull pain in her arms and the trembling of her knees, her gaze too remained unmoved.\nSomewhere deep inside, she quite appreciated these soldiers of White City. Their emotionless, unquestionable resolve toward battle, as though they could forget about everything else other than the opponents before them… She too could resonate with this feeling.\nWhile Leonel felt an excitement when he laid eyes on a battlefield, Aina felt a soothing calm. However, the raging blood in her veins told a completely different story.\nUnfortunately, this battlefield was completely unlike the battles Aina had experienced in the Joan Zone or even against the Invalids and Braziner family members she faced alongside Leonel.\nWhereas in those battles, she reaped lives as though they were weeds, on this battlefield she felt as though it was her own life that was constantly in danger. Even finding an opponent like this whom she was evenly matched with was a problem.\nThis wasn't because Aina was too weak, but rather because the soldiers of White City were simply too strong. Aina needed to exchange several moves to take down just a single one. And, since this was a battlefield and not a sanctioned duel, how could it possibly be that she would always be allowed a one on one battle?\nAina dug deep, a light shout parting her lips as she pressed her great sword forward.\nAn audible snap rang out. But, on such a large battlefield, the only two who likely heard it were Aina and the soldier before her.\nOther than a light flash in his gaze, the soldier didn't show any other reaction to Aina's blade piercing through his shoulder and cutting down through his hip.\nAina took deep breath, her amber eyes shooting forward as though already looking for a new opponent. But, she quickly found that there were already none left.\nAt that moment, an irrational rage welled up in her heart as she pulled her sword out from the corpse before her. Unfortunately, ust this small action caused her legs to tremble beneath the weight she carried.\nAina stabbed her sword into the ground, her body almost unable to continue standing.\n'Heal…'\nAina urged through her own thoughts, forcing her body to rapidly repair itself. The strain caused her scars to become even more inflamed.\nIf others were paying attention, it would become very obvious that the restrictions Aina was under didn't leave even her ability be…\nJust as Aina's vision was swimming, she suddenly felt an arm wrap around her shoulders. She looked up to find Mordred looking toward her with a worried expression.\nMordred was quite tall for a woman, almost a head taller than Aina. Even so, her visage was quite clear.\n\"Are you alright?\"\nAina nodded faintly.\nMordred wanted to say more but her expression suddenly changed.\n\"It can't be… another one?\" Mordred's brow furrowed.\n\"… Is there a problem?\"\nAina looked around the battlefield, but from what she could see, it was another victory. Though they had lost quite a number of knights and mages, it was still a victory nonetheless. Those that hadn't died had already long since retreated, so it was hard to tell what reason there could possibly be to have such a reaction.\nThat said, Aina was also very much aware that her sensory abilities weren't very good. So, she deferred to the most talented mage of Camelot. Aside from maybe Leonel, it was doubtful that there was anyone else on this moon with stronger Internal Sight in comparison to the Demon Empress.\nMordred's brows furrowed tighter.\n\"It's another army… I thought it was more men from White City, but it seems like this isn't the case. If it's not them, then it's more likely that it's… The Empire?\"\nAccording to what Mordred knew, the Empire had been attacking from the direction of Perveaux Barony. Though it hadn't been expressly stated, their actions most definitely took a lot of pressure off of Camelot and allowed the Demon Empire to focus all their thoughts on support.\nWhat Mordred expected the least, though, was that they'd leave their pincer position and come here. What purpose did they have for doing this? It can't be that they wanted to attack Camelot now… right?\nAt the moment, this battlefield was under Mordred's command and the large majority of the troops were demons. As for King Arthur's armies, they were on the more northern wing of the battlefield.\nThis was for the best. Though they now had an alliance, one couldn't just magically forget the past enmities between humans and demons. So, trying to fuse them into one fighting force would be like asking for problems to break out.\nThis was all to say that in order for The Empire to make it to them, they would most definitely have to go through Mordred and her men first.\n\"It doesn't look like they came to battle, but it doesn't look like they came on friendly terms either.\"\nAfter a while passed, The Empire's armies finally entered Aina's sensory ranges.\nShe was exceptionally sensitive to matters related to battle and could read the air quite well. The Empire definitely wasn't here for peace, but they didn't seem to be here to battle either. One might want to say that they came here as a neutral party, but it wasn't quite that either.\nAt the helm of the army, Prince Noah Fawkes stood on the back of a black wolf. Despite its swaying body, he didn't seem to be impacted in the slightest.\nTo his back, a group of nearly a thousand followed along. Many were also riding such wolves, but others rode various other beasts.\nThough the army wasn't completely uniform due to this, they still carried an oddly structured and strict air to them. Even their mismatching beasts couldn't detract from this.\nIt didn't take Mordred much to realize that these beasts were actually the demonic beasts of no-man's land. Somehow, The Empire had subjugated and domesticated these wild beasts even to the point of taking them to war.\nNoah had no idea that this action alone left Mordred in more awe than any of their other combined other actions had. Only she, who had been trying to reel in and reign over these beasts for decades, knew exactly how difficult it was.\nWhat was their goal here, exactly?",

      "content": "The slow approach of The Empire's warriors eventually put Mordred at ease. It seemed that Aina's words had been correct.\nIf their goal was to attack, they would have long since broken out into a charge. But, their current pace was almost like a leisurely stroll. In fact, they even allowed Mordred enough time to reorganize her army and face their entourage head-on.\nBy now, Arthur's warriors had also noticed the oddity.\n\"Your Majesty, should we send someone?\"\nArthur shook his head. \"I… Will go personally. Allow the men some rest and treat the injured. There's no telling when they will choose to attack again.\"\nNoah's troops came to a halt about a hundred meters from Mordred's frontline. Without a word, a small squad of five broke off, riding their black wolves forward swiftly. Though their pace was still a bit faster than the army had been, it still didn't seem like their goal was to attack.\nThe group of five was led by a young man. The expression on his face was indifferent and lofty, he carried the air of arrogance nobility should have but without allowing it to grow overblown. It was just enough to put many in a state of awe without allowing them to feel any sort of disgust.\nIt was clear that this young man's air of superiority was ingrained down to his very bones.\nWhen the small squad made it to within five meters of Mordred, they came to a stop, maintaining a healthy distance.\n\"I am the representative of His Highness, Prince Noah Fawkes, Junior Governor Duke Nile Bryermuthe. Who is your leader?\"\nNile's voice boomed over the battlefield. He didn't seem to realize that Mordred was right before him. Whether he did it on purpose or not, it was hard to tell. However, regardless, Mordred maintained her composure. She had been through much more in her life. If there was one thing she was excellent at, it was maintaining her calm.\n\"I am the leader of the Demon Empire.\" She said unhurriedly.\n\"I am the leader of Camelot.\"\nAt that moment, Arthur had made his way to Mordred's side. His expression wasn't as calm as his daughter's. Rather, it still held a lofty air.\nNile looked down from his position atop his wolf, sweeping a glance over the two of them. His gaze happened to catch upon Aina, her appearance causing him to frown. Her face made him inwardly uncomfortable, but he hid it well. There was no need to linger on such things. Though he could be wild at other times, it was unnecessary at this moment.\nBut, just when he planned to focus on Arthur and Mordred once again, his lips even opening to speak, his gaze sharpened.\nHe looked back toward Aina, his eyes landed on the hand she used to lean against her great sword with. No, it was more accurate to say that his gaze landed on the wrist of the hand she was using.\nEven at this moment, Aina's breathing was still a bit haggard. The only reason she was still at the front of the army was because Mordred had insisted on keeping her by her side because she was worried about Aina's current state.\nFor the past month an da half or so, Aina had done nothing but battle. It was hard to allow such a petite young girl to bear such a burden on her shoulders constantly, but Aina insisted to the point Mordred couldn't reject.\n\"You.\"\nAina didn't think anyone would be talking to her at this moment, so she was entirely focused on her recovery. She was trying to force her ability to activate again, but it had slowed down considerably.\nHer reaction, though, caused Nile's frown to deepen.\nAs though finally sensing that the atmosphere was oddly silent, Aina looked up, only to find that Nile's gaze was locked onto her.\nOf course, Aina was confused by this. She wasn't well known among the nobles. And, even if she was, this definitely wouldn't be the face they recognize.\nBeyond that, she didn't share the red hair and eyes of the Brazinger family. Even one of her own 'family' members only managed to recall her due to his perfect recall ability and he had long since been buried beneath dozens of meters of earth. So, it was even less likely that she'd be remembered for this.\n\"State your name and which Province you come from. Are you planning on defecting from The Empire?\"\nNile's gaze sharpened, boring into Aina as though trying to force her into a confession.\nYet, despite looking up toward Nile with tired eyes, Aina didn't seem intimidated in the slightest. What a joke, if Aina could remain calm and unperturbed beneath Leonel's aura, what was a mere Junior Governor Duke worth?\nOf course, at this moment, Aina wasn't necessarily thinking of things in such simple terms. She only knew that she was unmoved by it all. In fact, she was even slightly annoyed.\nCompared to others, Aina was actually quite thankful for The Empire. If not for it, she would have likely suffered even more hardship as a child. But, Aina's main priority was still revenge. What The Empire cared about her actions toward reaching this goal meant little to nothing to her.\n\"My name is Aina Brazinger, I come from Royal Blue Province. No, I have no intention of defecting from The Empire.\" Aina replied somewhat wearily.\n\"Then how is it that you are here and not protecting Royal Blue Fort—.\" Nile's words froze. \"Did you just say Aina Brazinger?\"\nNiles suddenly remembered that almost a year ago now, they received a report that they would be gaining two more Variants from Royal Blue Fort. One was a certain Leonel Morales and the second was Aina Brazinger.\nBut, for whatever reason, those two never appeared.\nDue to Earth's talents, after over a year of development, the rarity of Variants had plummeted as well. From just a handful, it had blossomed to several thousand. In fact, in their current army, not a single one wasn't a Variant.\nOf course, those who were Variants from the very beginning were far more valuable. And, Leonel and Aina were among this very rare few. In fact, considering where they started, they should be among the few who already had abilities within the Fifth Dimension.\nHowever, with this didn't come leniency. Rather, it made Aina's wrongdoings several times more severe.\nThe action of not properly reporting to The Capital could be considered a direct defiance of the Emperor's will!\nAfter reaching this point in his thoughts, Nile's aura became baleful.",

      "content": "Seeing that the situation was taking a turn for the worse, Mordred took a step forward and blocked Aina to her back, feeling slightly protective of this young girl.\n\"Aina is not tied with us, she is only here as a helper.\" Mordred tried to explain.\nNile's gaze remained locked onto Aina.\nAina felt her vision swimming, her feet feeling somewhat unsteady. From an outsiders perspective, it seemed as though she was feeling pressured by Nile's gaze. But, the reality was that her body seemed to want to shut down at this moment.\nAfter several minutes of trying to force her ability to activate, her situation only got worse. In fact, it seemed as though the repressive effects of her scars was getting fiercer.\nWithout the energy she needed to fight back against it, the situation she was facing only grew worse.\n\"The reason she is here is irrelevant. The fact that she is here at all is already a challenge to His Majesty's sovereignty.\"\nThe momentum of Nile and the four wolf riders to his back grew.\nIn the Ascension Empire, there were only a handful of titles without a democratic prefix attached to it. The reason behind this was clear, other than the royal family, others had to constantly scratch and claw for their positions. Any failure to do so would result in the destruction of countless generations of effort.\nDue to this structure, The Empire had fostered a sense of complete and unquestionable loyalty. Those who failed to meet such standards could just as easily be ostracized during the next cycle of elections. It was also exactly because of this reason that there were no noble families with useless heirs as useless heirs would only drive the effort of the family into the ground!\nIf Nile was found to have been aware of a traitor to The Empire yet hadn't taken action, the consequences would be unimaginable.\nTo begin with the Bryermuthe family didn't hold control over a powerful province. In fact, his Evergreen Province was located in harsh wintery climates year 'round, resulting in an economy that was somewhat crippled. They lacked resources or tourist worthy locations.\nTo compensate for this, the Evergreen Province was, ironically, a Province filled with factories and was as such ranked eighth amongst the Provinces. And, unfortunately, the only reason they were not ranked ninth was because Dark Cloud Province, the location of Dark Cloud Prison, was considered unranked.\nIt could be considered a blessing to the family that Nile had awakened as a Variant and had had the opportunity to stay by the Prince's side for the past year. But, he was also aware that his standing even compared to some Secretary Marquisette families was lacking.\nAs such, he couldn't afford to make any mistakes. He had to uphold the justice of The Empire properly.\nBy this point, though, Aina's mind was far too foggy to consider her surroundings. She stumbled and fell backward, only to be caught by Mordred who realized that something had gone wrong.\nBut, Nile had yet to finish speaking.\n\"And, I also hope that as a power soon to be under the jurisdiction of The Empire, that you wouldn't be harboring a criminal… correct?\"\nNile's gaze landed on Mordred and Arthur once again, his words far more forceful.\nIn the distance, Noah remained unmoved by it all. The distance was only a hundred meters, so with his newfound strength, he could easily hear the words Nile was speaking. Since he didn't find anything wrong with Nile's approach, he didn't make any moves.\n'Aina Brazinger, is it?' Noah's jaw steeled.\nHe recognized this name. Could she be from that family? But she didn't have the signature hair and eye color…\nThough Earth couldn't be considered as large as the universe, obviously, there were still many instances of unrelated people having the same last names. Knowing this, it was no wonder even those who were aware of the Morales name didn't automatically assume Leonel's origins.\nBut, in a world as small as Earth, especially after the eradication of over 99% of their population, such instances should be much rarer. Was there really such a coincidence?\nIt was no surprise that Noah was sensitive to the names of these hidden families. His grandfather had said that there were many enemies eyeing their Earth, and these hidden families were no exception.\nNoah wasn't quite sure of the origin of these families. But, there were two running theories he had come up with under his own research and a bit of Jessica's help.\nThe first possibility was that these hidden families were existences that once vied for supremacy over Earth like their Fawkes family had.\nThough it was easy to ignore it… but didn't their Fawkes family also all have the same white-gold hair and emerald green eyes?\nWhen Noah realized this on a certain day not that many years ago, he felt as though his whole world had been flipped upside down. Could it really be that their Fawkes family was just another hidden family that happened to claim victory?\nIt was possible… But there was also a second possibility as well.\nThis possibility was far more sinister. And, if this was true, Noah would stop at nothing to eradicate these hidden families.\nWith so many higher Dimensional worlds eyeing them, could it really be possible that none of them took any measures to claim a piece of Earth for themselves?\nWhat if the hidden families were actually branch members of higher Dimensional worlds that sent their people here in order to reach the fifth generation as quickly as possible?\nIf that was the case… wouldn't that mean that those higher Dimensional worlds weren't as far away as they all thought…?\nAs for which of these two theories was correct, Noah had no idea. But, what he did know was that he couldn't allow someone with the Brazinger family name to run around freely. And, even if Aina's last name wasn't Brazinger, her crimes alone would have definitely warranted detainment.\n\"Seize her.\" Nile said coldly. \"We'll take her back to The Capital for trial after all of this is over.\"\n--\n[Author's Note Below: 12/20/21]",

      "content": "Mordred felt slightly panicked.\nObviously, this wasn't because she feared Nile's strength. Whether it be by her own opinion or by the fact of reality, the truth was that there were very few on the current Earth that could match Mordred in power.\nThe issue was that this wasn't a situation she could brute force her way out of. Even if she easily deflected the advancement of these wolf riders, what would she do about the thousand strong army to their back? And even if they somehow managed to repel them, what would happen to the situation with White City if they suddenly began to infight?\nEven though The Empire seemed to be helping now, Mordred and Arthur alike were very much aware that Camelot wasn't their home ground. The Empire could easily choose to retreat and focus on Earth and come back.\nBut could they do the same? They could technically find a place on Earth, but what could their millions of citizens do? Where would they place them?\nUnlike on Earth where many if not most had some level of combat prowess by now and had tempered themselves over a year of hardship, the people of Camelot were still lagging behind in this aspect.\nEven as they awakened to their abilities, they were completely unused to using them and would be even more useless on a battlefield.\nTo make matters worse, Camelot didn't have a monitoring system like Earth did, so rounding everyone up would likely take months. By then, how many more would they lose?\n\"Boy, I think that's enough.\"\nAt that moment, King Arthur took a step forward.\nThe sight of his valiant air and white lion engraved armor was something to behold, indeed. Despite having chosen to yield to The Empire, that kingly air of his hadn't diminished in the slightest.\nHe only stood there, before his daughter and Aina, yet it felt as though the beasts engraved onto his white armor had come to life, causing the black wolves Nile and the other rode to tremble slightly.\nThey might have been demon beasts, but just how many of these beasts had Arthur killed in his life? He had long since lost count.\nNile frowned. \"Are you sure that you're aware of what you're doing?\"\n\"I'm well aware of what I'm doing. I have no idea what laws of your land this child has broken, but what I do know is that she's been fighting for our and your sake all this time. Is this what your Empire does to those that fight for them?\"\nNile's expression grew cold. \"Are you questioning The Empire?\"\n\"I have yet to become one of your people.\" Arthur replied just as coldly, taking a step forward that forced the shivering black wolves into an even sorrier position. \"In fact, I believe that in your minds, I am still nothing but a fairy tale, is that correct?\"\nArthur scanned the five before him and even sent a glance toward Noah in the distance.\nDespite meeting Arthur's gaze, Noah remained unmoved. A clash of royal air shot through the battlefield making the atmosphere several times heavier.\n\"I may be just an inconsequential fictional character in your minds, but you shouldn't forget that you're currently standing on my fictional lands, breathing my fictional air, and are in my fictional presence.\n\"Until the day Camelot cedes to The Empire, this will still be the case. If you want to take people under my protection beneath my nose, you'll have to taste my blade first.\"\nThe black wolves reeled and whined, kicking up to their hind legs. If it wasn't for the strength of their riders, Nile and the others would have definitely been kicked off.\nNile didn't seem to notice the poor performance of his black wolf. His eyes remained locked onto Arthur as though he was prepared to attack at any given moment.\n\"Nile, return.\"\nNoah's cold voice rang through the battlefield. His words alone seemed to dispel Arthur's aura, calming the black wolves down in an instant. The contrast was so drastic that even Arthur himself narrowed his eyes.\nNile didn't hesitate to follow Noah's orders, clicking his heels against the coat of his wolf and dashing back to The Empire's troops.\nMordred looked toward her father's back with a complicated glance.\nOn one hand, Mordred knew that this had always been her father's character. He wasn't a man who took kindly to others looking down on him. But, by the same token, over the years, he had begun to somewhat allow others to trample over him.\nIt seemed as though Arthur was overly prideful, but hadn't he allowed The Church and the thoughts of the nobles to dictate his own thoughts for a long time? There was no doubt that he had been hypocritical in this aspect in the past…\nBut now, he managed to hold his head high even after choosing to submit to The Empire. This was in stark contrast to the him of the past. It even brought a smile to Mordred's face before she could even reel it back in.\nIt was at that very moment that Aina suddenly collapsed completely.\n\"Aina!\" Mordred was shocked.\nShe had been propping Aina up from the very beginning, so she immediately realized the change in the weight she had to uphold.\nWhen Aina could no longer support her own self, Mordred was at a loss because even she herself almost collapsed.\n'What the hell is this weight? This girl!' Mordred sent a glance toward Aina's great sword and the massive curved box on her back.\nThis was a level of weight that even a Three Star Grand Knight wouldn't be able to carry around, let alone do battle with. What the hell was this little girl thinking?!\nMordred took action immediately, doing her best to pry the sword out of her hands and the package off her back. But, Aina's grip was so steely that Mordred found she couldn't budge it in the slightest.\nAina's face flushed red before draining into a sickly pale color. Her breathing became short and somewhat hurried, her lips slightly parted.\nMordred's eyes widened.\n\"Fa –\" Mordred hesitated. But, luckily, Arthur turned back in time to see his daughter's pleading gaze. \"Please heal her.\"\nArthur's gaze became serious as he nodded. But, just when he was about to take action, The Empire's troops moved.\n\"I'm greatly disappointed by your choice, Arthur.\"\nNoah's black wolf stalked forward, the army to his back moving as one.\n\"I'll give you another chance.\"\nAn oppressive aura surged out from Noah, a blue bladed saber appearing in his hand.\nThe moment it did, the black wolf beneath his feet collapsed, its spine snapping in half beneath the weight. Yet, Noah's steps didn't falter in the slightest, his aura only growing with an added bloodthirsty air.\nArthur's gaze became serious as he turned back.\nBut, no one expected for the situation at that moment to change once again.\n\"HAI!\"\nBeating war drums and blaring horns sounded from the distance.\nA woman with short hair, dressed in black robes accented by white flexible armor and wielding a massive two headed hammer stood at the helm of an army, her battle aura towering.",

      "content": "The battlefield was suddenly thrust into an unseemly situation.\nCamelot and the Demon Empire faced off against The Empire, but now there was White City who had suddenly inserted themselves into the mix.\nArthur, Mordred and Noah could immediately tell with absolute certainty that this army of White City's was much different than it had been in the past. Its aura was more oppressive, its momentum much more frightening, and the commander at its helm was on a completely different level.\nNoah's sharp gaze swept toward City Lord White's direction. They were still over a kilometer away, but by the time they broke out into a charge, it wouldn't even take a few minutes for them to cross over the final distance.\n\"Meralda!\"\n\"Yes, Empress?\"\nThe moment Mordred called out, a succubus demon stepped forward.\n\"Take Aina to the back line. Take some help with you to carry her things.\"\nMeralda blinked in slight confusion. Did she really need help for this?\nBut, her expression changed when Mordred passed over Aina's unconscious body.\nSuccubi were known for their strong Spirit Pressure. But, as demons, they also had bodies stronger than the average human knight. And, Meralda in particular, was a hand picked protector for the Demon Empress, so it wouldn't be a surprise if she was many times stronger than the average succubus. Yet, even she nearly collapsed.\nWithout a choice, Meralda listened to her Empress' words and quickly shuttled Aina away with the help of several others.\nAina's breathing continued to grow more erratic, her body becoming almost scolding to the touch. Despite the fact the temperature of Camelot was quite mild, her body billowed with steam as though she might erupt at any moment.\nMeralda wasn't sure what she could do about this. She wasn't a healer. All she could do was move Aina to the backline and hope the medical professionals could do something for her.\nNoah and Nile watched as Aina was being taken away, but they didn't say a word. This already wasn't a situation where they could continue to push their luck.\nArthur's gaze narrowed.\nTheir armies were currently facing Noah's. To face City Lord White, they would have to maneuver and shift their vanguard around, but doing such a thing was easier said than done. At the very least, Camelot didn't have such good military structure. In such a situation, even a well disciplined army would face issues.\nTo make matters worse, they had all just come out of a long, hard fought battle. The battlefield itself hadn't even been properly cleared yet.\nThis was completely unlike White City's previous pattern. Usually they would only levy one attack a day. It was clear in hindsight now that they had done this on purpose.\nThe good was that this army seemed to only be built of 500 or so men and women. The bad news, however, was that not only were all their ground units riding mounts, but they also had an aerial unit of more than 50 men and winged beasts.\nThe combined army of Camelot, the Demon Empire and The Empire numbered almost 3000. But, White City wasn't made up of fools.\nThough it could be argued that the appearance of The Empire on this battlefield should be an unknown variable for White City, there was no way White City didn't have forward scouts, and, as such, it was equally impossible that they wouldn't already be aware of The Empire's presence. Yet, they chose to charge forward regardless.\nArthur unsheathed his sword, causing a shimmering blade to dance beneath the high sun.\n\"KNIGHTS! ON ME!\"\nHis roar shook the battlefield.\n'[Holy Road]!'\nArthur's Spirit Pressure surged as his knees bent. The land beneath his feet cracked as he rocketed forward, a road of golden light following him as he arched across the skies.\nIn a single leap, he crossed into the no-man's land between Camelot's armies and White City's.\nHis actions spoke louder than words ever could. If The Empire still chose to attack them in situation, Camelot was all but finished.\nNoah watched this in silence, his gaze slowly shifting toward Mordred. But, it seemed as though Mordred didn't have any intention of taking the same actions as her father. She continued to face Noah, waiting for him to make a decision.\nNoah remained silent as though he couldn't feel the rumbling ground and the growing oppressive aura.\nWithout a word, his slow charge toward Mordred shifted directions, cutting an angle across the battlefield and toward White City's charging presence.\nAt that same moment, the remaining six Knights of the Round Table reacted to Arthur's call. They had to give the demon army and Camelot's army enough time to change face.\n\"Empress!\"\nMordred shifted her gaze away, looking toward Meralda who had come rushing back.\n\"What is it? Is the little girl alright?\"\n\"Yes, yes. I've already passed her along to the medical units.\"\n\"Then what is the problem?\"\n\"This… I.\" Meralda sighed. \"White City is also attacking for Perveaux Barony as well. I just received a voice transmission report, we're under siege.\"\nMordred's jaw clenched. In truth, she didn't need to hear this report to know that this would happen. The moment The Empire came here, she knew that her Empire was in danger.\nThough Mordred had returned home and regained a semblance of family, she couldn't just abandon the demons that had allowed her into their fold. The Demon Empire might not be her home anymore, but it was definitely theirs.\nA flicker of rage passed through Mordred's pupils. Did they really take her, the Demon Empress, so lightly?\n\"What's the situation?\"\n\"Your Majesty left Crakos in charge. He predicts that he can last about half a day before they have to retreat into the mountains once again. According to the report, there are at least ten White Knights on that battlefield.\"\n\"Ten?\" Mordred's brow furrowed deeper.\nAccording to what they knew, there were only 16 to begin with. One of them had been killed by Leonel, so there was only 15. For ten to be on that battlefield, it was clear that this was all planned out from the very beginning.\nThe worst part of all of this was that it couldn't be forgotten that this moon was a sphere. If White City conquered The Demon Empire, it would be as good as gaining two footholds to demolish Camelot with.\nA dark aura surged around Mordred, causing Meralda to shiver.\nAt that moment, Meralda's talisman glowed once again.\n\"Leave it to me, Em.\"\nMordred's rage suddenly dissipated with the wind. That voice, wasn't that Leonel? He was on the Perveaux battlefield? Why was he there? Did he already predict this?\n\"Don't worry, I'll send them packing soon.\"\nMordred could almost see Leonel's grin through the talisman, his air of confidence hanging palpably in the air.",

      "content": "Mordred hesitated, a slight air of guilt hanging around her.\nShe knew, almost better than the man himself, how much Leonel cared about Aina. She felt like she should tell Leonel about Aina's current condition. But, at the same time, she knew that Leonel was about to do something foolish again. If he was distracted by other thoughts, his life would definitely be in more danger.\nUnfortunately, due to the fact Mordred hesitated, Leonel had already disconnected before she could make a final decision, leaving her at a loss.\n\"Empress!\"\nMeralda's call woke Mordred from her stupor.\nAt that moment, Noah and Arthur were already about to clash with the frontline of White City's army.\nMordred's lost expression became steely, a baleful aura swirling around her. Vast amounts of Dark Elemental Force surged, her black dress fluttering in the wind.\nHer slender fingers wrapped around a wand as her figure rose into the air.\nShe walked toward the clouds as though the shadows were her stairway to heaven. If Leonel had been here, he would have recognized this ability as being near identical to Little Blackstar's own! Maybe it shouldn't be a surprise that the Demon Empress had become Shadow Sovereign…\nWhether or not she was a true Shadow Sovereign or not remained to be seen. But, what was most definitely true was that she had tapped into the same magic system as the little mink.\nStill, if the outside world knew that Earth had potentially produced two Shadow Sovereigns in the same generation… Who knew how they'd react?\n\"Those that can fly, with me.\"\nMordred's voice wasn't as booming as her father's. In fact, it carried the delicate touch of a woman. Yet, it felt no less imposing and grand. It felt as though her commands were irrefutable.\nAt that moment, several demons with bat-like wings shot into the skies under the behest of their queen, tearing a path toward White City's aerial units.\nThough fatigue was clear in their demeanors, the strength their Empress displayed gave them a second wind. They were prepared to follow her to the death.\nMeralda took several deep breaths on the ground, squeezing her long legs together tightly. Her expression seemed completely inappropriate for the occasion, but what else could you expect from a succubus.\nShe licked her lips, watching Mordred's bottom sway as she stepped into the skies.\n'The Empress is truly too enticing. These damned White City warriors…'\nMeralda felt frustrated. She wanted nothing more than to ravage the Empress right then and there. But, with this battle underway, she had no ability to do so.\nIt seemed that her only choice would be to wipe this army and their City Lord out first.\n\"Demonic Heralds of Darkness, charge!\"\nMeralda's half excited voice caused the blood of the male demons to surge, her hypnotic suggestion being several times more powerful now than they would be in any other situation.\nAs though maddened beasts, the demons roared into the skies, their savage bearings clashing against White City's momentum.\nAnd then, the armies met.\n**\n\"… Are you sure that you can battle?\"\nCrakos' deep and oddly intellectual voice drifted to Leonel's ears.\n\"Huh?\" Leonel's head snapped up as though he had just woken from a nap. But, his reaction only made the #1 Demon Lord even more anxious.\nUnlike what his confident voice had projected out before, the current Leonel was in a sorry state.\nHe wasn't injured at all. In fact, his body didn't have a scratch on it. But, other than that… he looked terrible.\nNot only did he smell awful, something that was quite surprising to someone like Crakos who had grown up around demons all his life, the bags beneath his eyes were so heavy that they almost formed new layers of skin all to their own.\nRivaling even the worse demons in poor hygiene was one matter, but the young man couldn't even keep his eyes open. How exactly was he going to battle?\nIt even seemed like he had sapped up all his remaining energy projecting that confident air to Mordred. After that, he had nothing left to give.\n\"Oh, yes, yes.\" Leonel nodded almost too slowly. \"Everything will be fine.\"\nCrakos' brow furrowed.\nAt the moment, the demons had only one advantage: the terrain.\nWhereas Camelot, The Empire and Mordred's troops were currently fighting on endless plains, Crakos had made the decision to retreat to the first line of mountains between no-man's land and the Demon Empire.\nBut, even with this advantage, it might not be enough. According to the scouts, there were more aerial units coming. And, whereas the army led by City Lord White was only made of 500, this one numbered 2000. They simply weren't properly equipped to deal with such a thing.\nLeonel's head nodded and he almost fell over before he caught himself, shaking his head awake again.\n\"Here.\" Leonel shoved a spatial ring at Crakos' chest. But, due to their difference in height, Leonel's hand landed on Crakos' abdomen instead. \"Take these and distribute one of each to the army.\"\n\"This…?\" Crakos' expression changed after his Internal Sight swept throughout the ring.\nHe was initially going to say something, but he was once again distracted by the state of Leonel's hands. If it wasn't for the fact he was sure Leonel was human, he would have thought that he was actually a zombie demon. Were these really the hands a healthy teenage boy should have?\nCrakos cleared his throat and peeled Leonel's hand off of his abdomen by pinching two of his fingers around Leonel's wrist.\n\"… I know that you're a growing boy, but you should really take it easy on the … extra curricular activities. Her Majesty has plenty of willing demonesses you can choose from that have quite a favorable impression of you.\"\nLeonel didn't even hear Crakos' words, his head nodding to sleep again before snapping awake.\n\"Huh?... Yes, yes, you're right, whatever…\" Leonel mumbled.\nCrakos sighed and walked away.\n\"Youths these days…\"",

      "content": "\"They've already retreated?\"\nAn army of 2000 strong marched forward. Despite the lack of enemies before them, their formation remained neat and organized. In fact, other than the unique sound of synchronized footsteps, the army had been completely silent until this point.\nAt the helm of it all, the warrior who spoke wore black robes accented with white flexible armor. He rode on a scaled horse Leonel would easily recognize as the steeds Heira and the other members of the Kaefir family had been using when they first ran across him.\nOf course, the ten individuals who headed this army were the White Knights of White City.\nEach of them rode upon one of these scaled horses, their demeanor stoic. It almost seemed out of place for any one of them to speak at all.\nAmong them, four were women and the remaining six were men.\n\"They've likely retreated to the first line of mountains.\" Another White Knight replied indifferently.\n\"Where they've retreated to doesn't matter. Their death is imminent.\"\nThe White Knights continued forward as though none of them had spoken a word to begin with. With barely a shred of communication, they shifted the direction the army was headed in, making a straight line toward the first line of defense.\nIt was not even a couple hours later that the first line of mountains came into view for the White City army.\n…\nSitting atop a mountain peak, Leonel's head nodded to sleep every so often.\n\"Yip! Yip!\"\nThe little mink lightly clawed at Leonel's face, waking him up.\n\"Oh? Are they here?\" Leonel asked.\nLeonel's gaze seemed somewhat sharper. Though the fatigue was still there, it seemed that he had at least rested his mind a bit. But, whether it would make much of a difference still remained to be seen.\nLeonel looked over the horizon.\nThough Camelot's lands had been dispelled of the perpetual rain, no-man's land and the Demon Empire still had heavy dark clouds hanging over it, a very familiar light drizzle of acidic rain pitter pattering ever so softly.\nFrom Leonel's vantage point, high up on a mountain peak, he could see the grey, cracked lands White City's army marched through.\nLeonel stood a bit too quickly, causing his head to spin.\n'More than 30 hours of sleep wasn't enough?' Leonel grasped onto his head, sighing lightly.\nIt had technically only been two hours of sleep. But, split between his minds, thanks to Dream Sense, it should have been the equivalent of more than 30. Unfortunately, it seemed that Leonel had underestimated just how much time he would need for his mind to recover.\n'This state should still be more than enough to deal with them.'\nLeonel's gaze grew cold, a calculating indifference reflecting in his eyes.\n…\n\"Hold.\"\nThe acting commander of the White City troops held up a palm.\nShe gazed calmly toward the looming mountains without an ounce of panic. Though they had been constantly sending canon fodder to the battlefields up to this point, that didn't mean their elites were standing idly by. In fact, they had already thought through their plan of attack thoroughly.\nFacing this mountain, the acting commander, White Knight Farialice, already had everything mapped out in her mind.\nHowever, the mark of a true commander wasn't so simple.\nGenerals all began by studying the battles of their predecessors before they got the chance to come to the battlefield on their own. But, Generals who restricted themselves based on what they had read on what were ultimately dead pieces of paper would be forever destined to not reach the pinnacle of warring masters.\nFarialice immediately felt that something was off just by laying her eyes on the mountain.\nThere were three paths up this mountain and there was no easy way to travel between them, at least not in large groups. The advantage of the demons was obviously being able to prepare in advance and having such great terrain to work with. But, the advantage for White City was that the demons would have no idea which paths they would pick.\nThe obvious choice for the demons, then, was to destroy two of the paths. Due to their narrow and not very safe to begin with structures, this task would have been very easy. This way, they would easily eliminate White City's first advantage by forcing them down a single path.\nThis would have been the perfect plan. Destroying all three paths would have shot the Demon Empire in the foot as well. After all, they also needed a path out. So, two was the perfect balance of hurting the enemy while helping themselves.\nOf course, White City had already been prepared for this. As a counter, they had hidden mechanisms within their supply units that would actually allow them to fly over the mountains entirely and assault the Palace from the skies.\nThough the mountainous structures appeared to be terrible from the outside, the location of the Demon Empress' palace was actually a flat of the mountainous land and, not unlike a castle, acted as its own city.\nBut, the problem was that the obvious action the demons should have taken by destroying the two paths… hadn't been taken at all.\nFrom the outside, this seemed to be a good thing. It should have meant that their enemies were more foolish than they thought. But, was this really the case?\nAccording to their intelligence, the demons were no less intelligent than humans. In fact, even if they weren't, their Empress was a human who should have easily been able to think of this.\n'Could it be that they want to begin the battle on the next mountain range? Did they retreat further back than we assumed?'\nFarialice thought that there was a good possibility that this could be the case. After all, this initial mountain pass only led to the main mountain range the Demon Palace could be found.\nHowever, if this was the case, their plans would definitely be less effective as the Palace would be heavily guarded. Compared to Camelot, the Demon Empire had many more aerial options available to them thanks to the variability of demonkind.\n'Interesting…'\nFarialice's lip curled.\n\"Begin phase one. My troop, Roah's troop, Cannon's troop… and Bourg's troop will not participate, we'll be going up the mountain on foot.\"\n\"HAI!\"\nWhite City's warriors got to work immediately, not doubting Farialice's judgment despite the fact it went against everything they had prepared for.\nSoon, massive platforms that almost looked like enlarged hot air balloon baskets soared into the air, each carrying dozens of warriors beneath the beating wings of massive birds of prey.\nAt the same time, Farialice led a troop of the remaining thousand on the ground and toward the middle mountain pass, her heart thumping with a will for battle.",

It seemed odd that he could see things happening from tens of kilometers away so clearly, but it didn't seem like a problem for him in the slightest.\n\"Crakos, lead your men down the middle pass of the mountain.\"\nLeonel seemed to speak to empty air, there wasn't a single soul on the mountain peak except for himself. Yet, in the instant he spoke, Crakos' men had moved out under his command.\n\"There are five White Knights in the group you're headed for. All five of them have strength surpassing your own, so be sure to follow my orders to a point.\"\nFarialice thought that the demons were planning something secretive due to their odd actions… When the reality was that Leonel didn't have a large overarching plan. What he did have were many trump cards he was ready to deploy at a moment's notice.\nThe first of these trump cards was… Leonel's own personal Force Disruption Towers.\nTo everyone, including those of Terrain, Force Disruption Towers had become impossible to use. This only made sense. As the world evolved, the laws of physics that governed it would also fundamentally change.\nBy the current age of technology, the pieces of engineering the people of Earth relied on were inextricably linked to concepts of chemistry, complex studies of physics and, even in some cases, biology.\nIn such a case, as these laws changed, the technology created to make use of them also became useless. Unless Earth adapted to the new changes with new creations of technology every time they evolved, tech would only become more and more useless as time went on.\nHowever, Leonel wasn't restricted to Earth's technology at all.\nJust two or so months ago, Leonel had witnessed the engineers of Royal Blue Fort attempt to piece together a Force Disruption Tower. Though they had failed to complete it in the end, Leonel had already taken note of all of the Tower's pieces.\nWith the level his mind had reached and the fact the Towers were created based on Third Dimensional constructs, memorizing everything with a glance was as easy as breathing for Leonel.\nAfter witnessing everything, it only became a matter of reverse engineering it all…\nHowever, even then, Leonel didn't need to go so far. What he needed wasn't a true working Force Disruption Tower. After all, they had become nearly useless after Earth entered the Fourth Dimension.\nNo, what Leonel needed was just a framework, a push in the right direction, a small light at the end of the tunnel… That would be enough to bring the warriors of White City hell.\n…\nFarialice led the vanguard through the mountain pass.\nRock walls surrounded them from all directions almost as though they had entered a dark valley rather than a passage up a mountain.\nThough the passage was considered 'narrow', this was only in consideration for an army of a thousand strong. The truth was that there was still 20 meters of clearance between the walls of the mountain pass.\nStill, with an army of this size, such a reality made quickly retreating almost an impossibility.\nBut, Farialice wasn't a fool. She was already prepared for any unexpected situations.\nThe reality was that whenever you were an army laying siege, losses would be inevitable. She entered this pass knowing very well that it might be a trap, but she was prepared to suffer whatever consequences might come with it.\nThis was the philosophy of the White City Knights. They as commanders road in the vanguard. They as commander took the brunt of the pressure on their shoulders. They as commanders would face all danger that came their way.\nIt was this top down philosophy that bred the fearless army of White City.\nWhen your commanders dared to lead the charge, what right did they as subordinates have to cower?\nFarialice's gaze narrowed. The ground only shifted a bit, but she sensed it. Her sensitivity to such things was beyond normal limits, not only due to her experience as a commander, but most importantly due to her ability.\nThis was the second reason she dared to enter this narrow passageway.\nFarialice's ability made her exceptionally sensitive to vibrations through the ground. But, what shocked her wasn't the fact there were vibrations… but rather that these vibrations were so… normal.\nThis rhythm, it could only come from an advancing troop.\nFarialice internally sneered. It couldn't be that they wanted to meet on this battlefield, right? Had she really overthought it? Did the demons just overestimate themselves?\nThough the reports said that the demons were just as intelligent as humans, it also said that they were quite hotblooded as well. They may very well be like their City Lord White, but completely lacking in the strength City Lord White had.\nStill, though Farialice thought this, she went on her guard, stopping the army at one of the many winding paths.\n'This is the best location to meet them.'\nThe current location had the White City army still moving uphill, which put them at a slight disadvantage. But, in return, the bend in the path more than made up for this.\nThe vast majority of people were right-handed, this was the case across the universe and across races. The position Farialice chose to stop at gave those with a dominant right hand the advantage. But, this was only a small part of the puzzle.\nThe main reason Farialice chose this location was because the demon army would have to curl around the path to meet them whereas White City's army could meet them head on.\nIf the demons were really as hot headed as they seemed, they would easily fall into this small trap.\nFarialice pulled out a sword while unsheathing a dagger with her left. This was her in her optimal state. A meter and a half length sword in her right and a short sword in her left. She had lost count of the number of enemies she had slaughtered with these two blades.\n'Hm? They stopped.'\nFarialice's gaze narrowed. It seemed she was correct to be cautious.\nA battle intent exuded from her body. Without a single word, the warriors to her back felt her excitement, their blood beginning to boil as well.\n…\n\"Activate it now.\"\nLeonel's expressionless voice shook Crakos' heart. Was this the same boy he had just been with?\nBut, without hesitation, Crakos gave the hand signal. In unison, the demons brandished their weapons, pouring all the Force they could muster into them.\nIn that instant, the quality of the air seemed to shift. The mountain pass gained an abnormal stillness.\n\"Charge.\" Leonel commanded.\n**\nA long distance away, in a military recovery tent on the Camelot battlefield, Aina tossed and turned, her breathing short and ragged.\nStrong pulsing veins coursed through her body, bulging throughout her neck.\nThe military tent soared past 100 degrees Celsius and seemed to still be climbing.",

      "content": "City Lord White held a combat prowess those of Earth had simply never seen before. If it wasn't for Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, Noah and Jessica all surrounding her at once, it felt like she could solo the entire battlefield on her own.\nYet, even with so many working together, she didn't seem to be even slightly disadvantaged. In fact, she even held the upper hand, her strength causing the skies to tremble and the earth to quake.\nCity Lord White swung 'Clara' with a single hand, sending King Arthur flying backward.\nArthur's feet dug a deep pit in the ground, his body sinking down into a strong horse stance as he held Excalibur across his body.\nCity Lord White's irises glittered somewhat. She was inwardly shocked, not because of the strength of the enemies she faced, but rather because of the quality of their weapons.\nLogically speaking, it was impossible for such a fledgling world to have such powerful weapons. Their weakness should also come with an appropriate lack of resources. Yet, this wasn't the case at all. In fact, if it wasn't for White City being severely outclassed in weaponry, this war might have come to an end long ago.\nJust as an example, there was the sword in Arthur's hands. It shouldn't have been able to survive even a single strike from her before shattering. Yet, not only did it not show any signs of collapsing, it was even faintly putting pressure on her double-headed weapon.\nAs though that wasn't bad enough, there was Arthur's white armor. Though City Lord White wasn't a weapon's expert, she could still tell that Arthur's armor reinforced his Force and deflected almost 10% of her attacks. If it wasn't for her sturdy build, City Lord White would have suffered a great deal.\nIf it was just Arthur, things might have been fine. But, there was still Noah's saber and Jessica's whip, in fact, even the Knights of the Round Table all had weapons and armor superior to her own. This was especially the case for Lancelot and his golden lance. It felt that if she was even a little careless, she would be pierced all the way through.\nOn Terrain… such weapons simply didn't exist. Though worlds could have heirlooms they passed down at this quality, and, being in her position, City Lord White would definitely be in position to have one such weapon, it had to be remembered that Terrain was deemed as a world without talent.\nAs a result of this, Terrain never received the support of higher Dimensional worlds and as such never received rewards for their Zones. The only 'benefit' of clearing Zones for Terrain was helping their world to survive another day and maybe the training they could receive by putting their lives on the line.\nThis was the reality of the world. There was no such thing as fairness.\nTerrain didn't receive the support of higher Dimensional worlds because they weren't talented. By the same token, these higher Dimensional worlds had no obligation to help Earth either.\nLike this City Lord White faced enemies with Tier 9 Black and Quasi Bronze treasures all around while she herself only wielded a Tier 7 Black treasure she treated like her own child.\nYet, despite the situation, a maddening grin hung across her attractive face. Her slender arms bulged with strength it shouldn't have, blasting another two Knights of the Round Table away.\n\"Come! Show me more! I haven't bled in a long time, can you let me see the color of my blood?!\"\nCity Lord White's laughter rang throughout the battlefield. Her voice was like a beacon in the darkness for her men, constantly fueling their momentum.\nHow could their blood not boil? Even when so many faced their Commander at once, they were simply no match for her.\nNoah brandished his blue bladed saber. If those who weren't aware of his abilities saw him now, they would be stunned.\nNormally, Noah was just around two meters tall. But now, he stood at over five, his body exuding the valiant air of a god descended from the skies.\nHis blade increased in size with him, swinging down at City Lord White with a might that made the wind tremble.\n\"Good!\" City Lord White flicked her wrist upward, easily deflecting Noah's saber as though it was no heavier than a feather.\nShe reset herself, looking to swing at and shatter Noah's knee, but Jessica reacted quickly, causing several demonic beasts to pounce at the City Lord.\nHowever, City Lord White's sinister grin only grew wider. As though it put no pressure on her wrists at all, she easily shifted her aim with a thought, shattering the skulls of three beasts with a single flicker.\nNoah felt as though his arm was about to shatter beneath the she-devil's counter attack.\nHis ability wasn't as simple as gigantification. He could increase the size of his body and any object he so chose, but he could also control density along with this ability.\nEveryone knew that volume increased by a cubic while surface area increased by a square. This meant that there was a limit to how large the human body could become before it collapsed in on itself.\nHowever, Noah could bypass this by increasing the density of his bones several fold at will. Even making his bones as strong as diamond wasn't impossible with his current ability. In the future, making himself as durable as a Fourth Dimensional or higher metals would just be a thought away.\nThis was all to say that Noah could make his own weight increase to an inconceivable degree and he would also be able to proportionally increase his muscle density to have the strength to back it up.\nYet… City Lord White deflected it all with a flick of her wrist.\nAt that moment, King Arthur dug himself out of the trench he had slid back in, charging back toward City Lord White with the same valiant air.\nGolden lights surged around his body, dancing along with his blade as he cleaved forward.\nCity Lord White's laughter sounded as she sent him flying once more.\nIn the blink of an eye, she appeared amidst the Knights of the Round table, forcing them to quickly defend themselves.\nBut the result was only to be expected. Blood flew from their lips as they were sent flying.\nCity Lord White shot forward, appearing before King Arthur, her double headed hammer already swinging downward, a manic laughter hanging in the air.\nKing Arthur's visage remained stoic, slamming a palm into the ground and flipping out of the way.\nHowever, City Lord White's nimbleness was beyond his comprehension. With a twist of her wrist, her target changed like flowing water, aimed right for King Arthur's head.\nArthur's gaze sharpened, the scent of death hanging over him. He could almost feel the grim reaper whispering into his ears.\nWith the quickest movements he could muster, he rose Excalibur to his face, trying to block it.\nCity Lord White's laughter didn't pause for even a moment. She could almost smell the blood spraying into the air.\nIt was at that moment that a strong surge of magic shook the battlefield.\nA shield of ice quickly formed in the path of City Lord White's hammer, causing it to slow and pause just for a moment before being shattered.\nBy then, King Arthur had already taken advantage of the opportunity to dodge out of the way, City Lord White's hammer just scraping a hair's breadth from his head.\nIn the distance, the blue eyes of Queen Guinevere shone like two sparkling sapphire gems.\nThe Queen of Camelot had stepped onto the battlefield for the first time in decades.",

      "content": "Queen Guinevere's Spirit Pressure seemed to make the skies bow down. It was only at this moment that the people of Camelot and the Demon Empire realized that the strongest mage of Camelot wasn't The Pope, nor was it Arthur, nor was it even Mordred…\nIt was the Queen of the people. Guinevere Pendragon.\n\"Hoho! Good! The more, the merrier!\"\nCity Lord White's laughter continued, brandishing her hammer to smash toward King Arthur again as though she hadn't sensed Guinevere's presence in the least.\nSharp, icy winds spun around the Queen, her black hair rapidly becoming coated in a thin layer of ice. In an instant, her tanned skin and black hair became as white as snow, her eyes becoming such a pale shade of blue that they too seemed to become white.\nSeveral javelins of ice formed to her back, shattering the sound barrier as they shot forward.\nThe mages of Camelot immediately reeled in shock. They couldn't wrap their minds around how the Queen displayed such prowess without her wand.\nAt that moment, City Lord White became more serious. She wasn't a well informed person. All she knew was battle. If it wasn't related to brandishing her hammer, she didn't want to hear about it.\nBut, what she did have were instincts honed over countless years of endless battle. So, though she didn't know the name of the exact Innate Force Node Queen Guinevere had awakened, she knew that it couldn't be a weak one.\n\"Ha!\"\nCity Lord White swung her hammer toward the incoming ice javelins. The shattering of ice resounded through the battlefield, gorgeous snowflakes wildly fluttering at the point of contact.\nUnder the astonished gazes of many, City Lord White took a single step back. Though it was just one, it filled King Arthur and the others with fighting spirit. This wild she-devil had finally shown a weakness.\nIn the skies, Mordred finally sighed a breath of relief. When Arthur almost died, she felt her heart seize. She never thought that she would have such a strong reaction to the almost death of her father. It seemed that blood was truly thicker than water.\nUnfortunately, she wasn't able to come down from the skies. If she let the aerial units of White City run rampant, this battle would be over as soon as it started.\nLuckily, her mother had come to the battlefield.\nUnder normal circumstances, King Arthur would never allow her to. In fact, the only reason he allowed Mordred to battle at all was because he didn't really have a choice. After all, she was the ruler of the demons. If she wasn't here, who would take command of them exactly? There was a reason Lionus couldn't be found on the battlefield.\nGuinevere's appearance caused the landscape of the war to shift once again.\nCity Lord White was constantly placed on her backfoot, her hammer deflecting Guinevere's barrage of ice javelin's.\nGuinevere's ranged assault put even Leonel to shame. To be able to put so much power into each strike, it was well beyond anything the current Leonel could do. It was hard to believe that Camelot still had such a trump card in the wings.\nIt seemed that the awakening of Guinevere's ability made her powerful beyond belief.\nTaking advantage of Guinevere keeping City Lord White pinned down, the others began to act as well, pincering the City Lord from all sides.\nKing Arthur activated [Light Domain], sending a barrage of light projectiles toward City Lord White as well.\nNoah brandished his saber, using the openings Queen Guinevere created to send out strikes of his own.\nIn the blink of an eye, it seemed as though everything had flipped on its head. Even City Lord White's laughter seemed to have come to a grinding halt.\nHowever, those who assaulted her didn't seem capable of relaxing even for a moment. No, it wasn't that they weren't capable, but rather that they couldn't. City Lord White's laughter may have come to a close, but the look on her face sent shivers down all of their spines.\nHer grin became wider and wider, a sinister darkness cascading over her face.\nThe solemn atmosphere of the battlefield seemed to grow several fold. It was as though City Lord White's lack of laughter was even more of a sign than her actual laughter had been. And… the only ones who seemed to be in the dark about this were the experts locked in battle with her.\n\"Good. Good. Good. Now, I can finally go all out!\"\nIn the distance, Niya watched on, a clipboard being hugged against her chest. She shook her head, lamenting the state of things.\n'It would have been better if they were too weak, at least then City Lord wouldn't truly go berserk.' Niya sighed. 'How will we reel her in this time…?'\nNiya began to rack her brain. As far as she was concerned, this battle was as good as over. She only hoped that her City Lord didn't sink too far in this time.\n\"Blood! Blood! BLOOD!\"\nCity Lord White's cry almost manifested like a banshee's. It was a shrill shriek that could cause one's blood to curdle and one's heart to stop.\nAt that moment, City Lord White's short hair suddenly began to wildly grow. In the blink of an eye, it became like a river of crimson floating in the air.\nWhat was even more shocking, though, was the change to her eyes. In a moment, the whites of her eyes became a blood red, while her irises became a murky grey. No matter how one looked at her, she looked like a demon incarnate…\nBut, as though to ensure those who didn't think so saw through to the truth of the situation, corpses from all around the battlefield trembled. Then, in the blink of an eye, they were completely drained, streams of blood from their dead bodies shooting into the air and pouring into City Lord White's hair as though to nurture it.\n\"BLOOD! BLOOD! BLOOD!\"\nCity Lord White's laughter once again sounded, but this time, it felt as though three women were laughing at once, then it was four, then five. Very soon, it was impossible to tell that they were women at all.\nWhen everyone realized what was happening, their eyes widened in shock.\nIt wasn't City Lord White's laughter anymore at all. In fact, other than the mad grin on her face, City Lord White's mouth didn't open at all.\nThe laughter… it was coming from the blood… It was the voices of the dead piercing through the veil of the living as though to remind them all not to forget.\nCity Lord White shot forward, her speed more than triple what it had been before.\nIn less than a breath, she appeared before Lancelot, her hammer swinging forth.\nLancelot reacted as quickly as he could, piercing forward and up with his lance. But, a vibrant red glow that pulsed like a beating heart appeared on City Lord White's hammer as it smashed downward.\nAt the instant of contact, Lancelot felt pain like he never had before.\nThe bones in his legs collapsed in on themselves, what remained of his knee piercing through his skin in gruesome fashion.\nAll the strength he had accumulated seemed to be no better than a child swinging with all their might at an adult. In all his life, Lancelot had never felt so weak, nor had he ever suffered through such pain.\n\"Lancelot!\"\nArthur, Guinevere and the Knights of the Round Table all shouted in rage at once. But, City Lord White's laughter was like a melodious tune being plucked to their suffering.\n…\nAt that moment, within a military healing tent, the temperature had already skyrocketed past 200 degrees Celsius. The heart beat of the young girl had grown so loud that it could be heard even outside the flapping curtains…\nIt was in that instant that her eyes shot open, reflecting a blinding golden light.\n\"Blood…\"\nThe voice was soft, but it seemed to reach the ears of every person on the battlefield.",

      "content": "~A year ago~\nAina stood from her seated position, power she had never felt before coursing through her veins. She had already expected that the blood of a Fifth Dimensional creature would give her a massive boost to her strength, but she was still somewhat surprised that it allowed her to directly shatter the barrier to the Fourth Dimension.\nThe Fourth Dimension was different from the Third. It could be said that both Planes of Existence laid a foundation, but the method in which they did so was much different.\nIn order to understand what this difference was, it had to be known that the minimum requirement for passing down a Lineage Factor was being an existence at the Fourth Dimension. Only upon gaining some mastery of this Dimension would one reach the necessary threshold.\nThe Third Dimension formed one's Force Nodes. The number one managed to form would remain unchanged, at least for the time being. This made one's success within the Third Dimension a direct predictor of one's success in the future.\nThe Fourth Dimension built upon this foundation. Not only did one transition for Third Dimensional to Fourth Dimensional Force, but one also began the process of body refinement.\nThough it seemed like Dimensions were just 'power levels', this wasn't the case at all. When transitioning between Dimensions, one was quite literally ascending to a new plane of existence. This was why the gap between Dimensions was impossible to cross.\nThe Third Dimension allowed one to create Fourth Dimensional constructs within one's body: the Force Nodes. While the Fourth Dimension was the process of dispelling what impurities remained of the Third and Fourth Dimensions to allow a smooth transition into the Fifth Dimension.\nAt the Fifth Dimension, this was where the true powerful existences of the Dimensional Verse began to appear.\nAs such, there was one main goal of the Fourth Dimension: to purify.\nWhether that be the blood, the bones, the organs. Everything needed to be cleansed of filth lingering from lesser Dimensions. Only by doing this would it be possible to ascend to a higher level of being.\nHowever, unlike the Third Dimension, there wasn't just one method of completing this requirement. In fact, the Fourth Dimension was where the numerous diverging paths of the Dimensional Verse truly began to shine.\nFor someone like Aina, the path she would choose was very simple. With her ability, it only made sense to focus on her blood.\nThe blood was the life liquid the remainder of the body relied on. There wasn't a single crevice one could find in the body where it wasn't a major player. And, thanks to Aina's affinities and her ability, this was also among the easiest paths for her to take.\nAs for how the power level of the Fourth Dimension worked, this was much more straightforward.\nIn order to transition from the use of Third Dimensional Force to Fourth Dimensional Force, the body had to be properly primed. Only by ridding oneself of these impurities would one be able to truly begin to use Fourth Dimensional Force.\nUpon reaching the First Tier, one would be able to fill one of their Force Nodes with Fourth Dimensional Force. Upon reaching the Second Tier, one would be able to withstand the filling of two Force Nodes with Fourth Dimensional Force. So on and so forth.\nHowever, one can easily see from this how divisions might be caused due to one's level of success within the Third Dimension.\nNot only were the sizes of everyone's Force Nodes different, but even the amount of Force Nodes one formed weren't all consistently the same. This meant that two individuals who could be considered Tier One Fourth Dimensional existences could be of vastly different strengths. And, the effort they had to put in to reach this level would definitely vastly differ as well.\nBut, only upon reaching Tier One would one truly be considered a Fourth Dimensional existence.\nAs though all of this wasn't complicated enough, the universe seemed to hate making things neat and tidy.\nBy now, those with sharp minds would have realized that though forming large Force Nodes and reaching the maximum level of Nine gave one an advantage, it would also be easy to realize that this didn't restrict one from continuing to purify one's body.\nEven if you only formed three Force Nodes and could already sustain Fourth Dimensional Force in them all, what was stopping you from continuing to refine and purify your body?\nFor example, compared to Leonel, Aina's Force Nodes were much smaller, not even close to Leonel's 100 cell size. And, though she had managed to form nine of them, her talent in energy manipulation was low due to her lack of talent with Internal Sight. Unfortunately, both of these things would be linked.\nHowever… Compared to others Aina's talent in refining her body were leagues beyond. Leonel could only rely on his Lineage Factor to match her in this regard.\nWhat did all of this mean? It meant that technically, one could have a poor showing and set a terrible foundation within the Third Dimension, yet still become an undefeatable existence within the Fourth Dimension.\nAina was one such person. Though her foundation within the Third Dimension couldn't be considered to be bad, it wasn't among the very best either. However, her talent for growth within the Fourth Dimension was beyond what most could fathom.\nIn fact, without having spent even a single minute within the Fourth Dimension, Aina had already cleared the requirements to be considered a Tier Two Fourth Dimensional existence.\nOf course, this was mostly in thanks due to the Abyssal Panther blood she just ingested. That said, how many others could ingest Fifth Dimensional blood in the Third and live to tell about it?\nAina flexed her body, basking beneath the popping of her joints. Other than the discomfort her inflamed scars were bringing her, she had never felt more at ease in her life. Her blood thrummed and her heart gave out long and steady beats. She felt as though she could shatter the world with a single fist.\n'It's time for me to find a path out of here. Though Tier Two Fourth Dimensional strength is good, they were at least at Tier Four or Five in strength…'\nAina's Tier Two strength was likely worth more than a usual Tier Three existence on Terrain due to the size of her Force Nodes. Though she couldn't compare to Leonel, that didn't mean she lost out to those with such poor talent. But, leaping over any more would be troublesome, at least when she was facing so many of them at once.\nPlus, there were other factors to strength than just one's base powerful level like Styles and Embryos. Aina still needed to train herself more.\nSo, she traveled deeper into the cave, not knowing a thing about the horrible experience that lied in wait for her.",

      "content": "The people of Terrain say that the Mountain Sands Range was a forbidden zone. It gained its name because according to legend, the deeper one traveled into this mountain range, the more difficult it became to leave.\nUnfortunately, when she entered this mountain range, Aina had no idea about this. Due to her hasty teleportation, rather than being sent to a proper city like Leonel had, she appeared in the wilderness where she just so happened to stumble across a Variant Zone.\nDue to the nature of a Variant Zone, Aina managed to claim rewards despite her competitors being several times more powerful. But, this made her escape all the more difficult.\nWithout a choice, she charged into the mountain range and eventually managed to find this network of tunnels.\nKnowing it wasn't safe to go back the way she came, believing that those three Heirs were still chasing her, Aina instead decided to find a secluded location to breakthrough. Now, she was hoping to find an alternate exit.\nUnlike Leonel, Aina didn't have perfect recall nor did she have a powerful mind. This wasn't to say that she wasn't intelligent, but rather that she wasn't as much of a monster in this regard as compared to Leonel. After all, Leonel's mind could probably put a supercomputer of the 25th Century to shame.\nWithout a choice, Aina could only travel forward slowly, leaving marks on the walls of the caves traveled through to remind her of where she had been and whether she was traveling in circles or not.\nLuckily, Aina had the small sword she gained from the Variant Zone. It was much more convenient to use than her massive ax on in such small quarters.\n[Author's Note: Yes, small sword. Note that Aina's great sword has not appeared yet at this point]\nBy now, Aina had long since placed her sensory boosting headpiece on. Before, she had been hesitant to do so.\nCompared to Leonel, she was much more informed about the situation of other worlds. So, she was very much aware how much of a draw a Quasi Bronze treasure could be. As such, she hid the fact she had one while within the Variant Zone. But now that she had become the enemy of those three anyway, even if she ran into them now, it wouldn't make much of a difference. After all, the blood of a Fifth Dimensional entity could be considered about equal to a Quasi Bronze treasure. In fact, to the right person, it would be even more valuable.\n'The Force is getting denser?'\nAina's brows raised, a faint excitement in her heart. If Force was increasing in the direction she was walking, it was very likely that there could be treasures lying in wait. It wasn't rare for such ancient networks of caves to have untapped mines.\nAina continued to mark the walls she came across with arrows, maintaining her caution.\nUsually, the most sensitive creatures to shifts in Force density weren't humanoids but rather beasts and Invalids. Though Invalids only cared about devouring humans, beasts were different. Whether it was humans or resources, they would be interested in both. It wouldn't be a surprise if a beast called this place home.\nAs Aina approached the location of the increased Force density, she heard a faint scratching noise that caused her steps to freeze.\nThough Aina's senses weren't very powerful, thanks to her strong body, what she did have was great hearing and eyesight. In fact, after absorbing the Abyssal Panther's blood, her ability to see in the darkness was no worse than her ability to see in the light which was very helpful in this dark environment.\n'There's something up ahead…'\nAina crouched, slinking forward as though she truly was a panther. The light in her amber eyes seemed to dim toward a darker hue and gained a more feline look to them.\nHer black hair melded into the darkness as she quickly darted forward, making it to the small branching pathway the noise was coming from.\nAfter peeking inside, Aina was stunned by what she saw.\n'An Invalid!'\nAina's heartbeat quickened slightly before she forced it to enter another slow and calming rhythm.\nShe was well aware that any Invalids that managed to survive this long on a world that had long since gone through its Metamorphosis wasn't an existence she could look down upon. But, at the same time, such Invalids would leave behind great stores of energy.\nWhenever an Invalid was killed, they would become the purest globule of Force imaginable. When this was absorbed, it would be a great boon to a body. The stronger the Invalid was, the greater the benefit would be as well.\nThe only unfortunate thing, or maybe fortunate in this case, was that Terrain was a world without much talent. Though Invalids that survived this long would indeed be powerful, they still had a limit on just how powerful they could become.\nInvalids had an exceptionally difficult time traveling between worlds for obvious reasons. So, if all they could devour were low talent humans, they'd be equally as pitiful.\nAina brandished her sword, prepared to strike at any moment.\n'What is it scratching and claw at?'\nAina had never seen an Invalid act in this way. They would usually be placid and without emotion. Their only goals in 'life' was to devour other humans and evolve themselves. Something like an Invalid being so interested in a wall was unheard of, even if said wall had a treasure lying behind it.\nAina shook her head and removed all distracting thoughts.\nInvalids were incredibly sensitive to Force, so she didn't dare to use it. But, with her strength, especially after tempering her blood once, she didn't need to.\nJust a single strike to the head. That would be enough to make sure this Invalid never saw the light of day again.\nAina's thighs flexed, her body crouching like a strung bow.\nBANG!\nThe Invalid froze, its scratching coming to a stop when it heard the noise. But, Aina had already appeared to its back, aiming a blade at the back of its skull.\nAt that moment, the Invalid's head suddenly spun 180 degrees, its placid white eyes locking onto Aina's approaching blade.\nAina felt something grab at her heart as though trying to fill her with fear. But, her blade never stopped, shooting through the Invalid's skull in the next instant.\nThe Invalid's forehead was split by Aina's blade, but its eyes remained locked onto Aina as its lifeforce dimmed.\nBut, just as it was about to fade into motes of light, its jaw went slack, hanging open at an awkward angle as though a wooden puppet with a loose screw.\nAnd then, it screamed.\nThe sound was so loud that Aina felt her eardrums shatter. But, she didn't have the time to linger on the pain in the slightest.\nShe felt that this scream hadn't been a normal scream… it was a signal and she was the subject of the information being sent.",

      "content": "Aina pulled her sword out quickly.\nShe didn't quite understand what was happening. Shouldn't Invalids be creatures of instinct? They shouldn't have any intelligence or sense of comradery. Something like signaling one's allies was a distinctly human trait. Sometimes beasts of higher intelligence would engage in such matters as well. But, Invalids? That should never happen.\n'It didn't become energy?'\nAina was shocked once again. The Invalid before her collapsed, but it didn't disappear into energy she could absorb. Just what was happening?\nAina's heart seized. Did she make a mistake? Was it not an Invalid at all?\nNo, that was impossible. Its eyes, its aura, its demeanor, it all screamed Invalid. So, what was happening exactly?\nAina didn't believe that she would make such a rookie mistake. Plus, what existence other than an Invalid could shriek like that even after having its head pierced through?\nAina was certain, it hadn't been a shriek of pain or unwillingness. It had no emotion behind it all, it was completely hollow and without conscience.\n'I need to move.'\nAina thrust these thoughts to the back of her mind, taking a glance at the wall the 'Invalid' had been scratching at.\nIf Leonel had been there, he would immediately recognize the Tier 5 Black Ore embedded into the wall. It wasn't very valuable, but it wasn't worthless either. At the very least, it could sell for a couple kilograms of Black Urbe Ore.\n'I don't have time to dig it out and it doesn't seem like a very high level ore either.' Aina nodded to herself. 'Run.'\nWithout hesitation, Aina turned tail and ran. She felt it was unfortunate that she had placed herself in such a difficult situation for such a worthless Ore she couldn't even mine, but there was no time to cry over spilt milk.\nAina shot back in the direction she came.\nShe knew she didn't have enough time to run and create new markings on the wall. And, if she got lost in these tunnels, there would be no one to come out and save her. Therefore, her best chance was to follow her arrows in reverse.\nIf that screech was really a signal as she thought, then it likely meant that there were more Invalids on their way. If she was correct, then her arrows wouldn't mean much if anything to them. With their low intelligence, she didn't need to worry about being followed.\nAina rounded a corner with confidence, only to come to a grinding halt.\nThere were three of them blocking her path, all of them with their backs facing her. But, they all simultaneously rotated their heads in her direction as though they were night time owls. It was the kind of sight that sent shivers down one's spine.\nAina hesitated, her jaw clenched.\nShould she go forward? Or run back?\nThe former was the only way for her to continue following her arrows. But, the latter would force her to forget her initial plans entirely. There was no way she would be able to keep a mental map of where she was going and getting lost would be a near guarantee.\nThis network of tunnels simply had too many diverging paths. If it wasn't for this, there was no way that Aina would only meet these Invalids on her way back and never even sense them during her first trip down this passage.\nAina grit her teeth. 'Forward!'\nShe knew that this was the best choice she had. If there were Invalids on her way back, that only meant that she had been very lucky not to run into them on the way here. If that was the case, there might very well be even more if she headed in deeper rather than trying to exit. Her only way out of this situation was to leave this network of tunnels entirely.\nAina's blood began to boil, a faint red hue covering her blade and her body.\nWith a thought, she shot forward, brandishing her blade.\nThe three Invalids reacted all at once, but their reactions seemed disjointed. Though they were as fast as Fourth Dimensional humans, their joints would often bend at odd angles as though they were double jointed in all areas.\nThey moved less like humanoids and more like some alien species just learning how to walk on their own two feet thanks to bodies they had snatched.\nThe sight send a cold shiver down Aina's back, but this was a good thing for her. The less coordinated they were, the greater chance she had of leaving this place.\nWith a sweep of her blade, one lost an arm and a leg in quick succession. Without even bothering with the remaining two, she shot by the gap she created after the Invalid toppled over, nearly hitting her head on the ceiling of the cave as she soared by them.\nAina pumped her legs as quickly as she could, no longer minding the noise she might make. As long as the Invalids she came across continued to be so uncoordinated and slow, she just had to continue running with all her might.\nShe rounded several corners, almost lamenting her previous actions. Why couldn't she had traveled in a straight line before? What possessed her to take so many turns?!\nAina ran into several more Invalids. Many were alone, allowing her to easily bypass them. But, a few came in groups of two and three. Still, it wasn't beyond her means of dealing with.\nHowever, she grew more anxious the more she ran. How were there so many Invalids here? Why did none of them become motes of light? Why were they all acting so weirdly?\nShe couldn't fathom how there were so many here. The more she ran into, the more she began to question how she had traveled so deeply without running into even a single one.\n'Dammit!'\nAina rounded another corner, only to run into several more Invalids. But this time, they numbered almost a dozen.\nTheir odd interactions continued. As though they couldn't sense their comrades by their sides, they all tried to squeeze into the narrow tunnel at once.\nThey pushed against each other, shifting to their sides as they continued to press forward.\nIt should have been a comedic sight. Some of the Invalids had their cheeks pressed flush against one another, others even had their noses squished as though they couldn't kiss each other deeply enough.\nBut, their emotionless gazes and their indifferent expressions sent a shiver down one's spine. It was as though they would stop at nothing until they devoured Aina.\nAina clenched her teeth. She was so close. She could feel it. It had only taken her half an hour to travel as deeply as she did, but she had already been sprinting with all her might for almost five minutes. She knew that she must be closing in on the exit.\nBut, just when she had been, eleven Invalids completely blocked her path forward.\n'Continue!' Aina wanted to press forward. She just had to get past this line and she would be free.\nUnfortunately, reality was cruel. Just when she took a step forward, she saw another wave of Invalids coming between the cracks of the 11 that had squeezed themselves together.\nIf they combined into one, their numbers would exceed 20!\nAina's eyes flickered with a hint of helplessness.\nWithout a choice she shot into a diverging path, knowing full well that she was now lost.",
