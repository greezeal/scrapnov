      "content": "Chapter 1: Chapter 0- Break up\n*Click*\nAs the door opened, the dark and murky room was greeted with a fresh wave of sunlight and air.\nThe only resident of the apartment flat shielded his face, having sunlight striking him harshly.\n\"Ugh, man! It was a curse letting you know my passcode.\" The boy grumbled as he saw his friend entering his room while carrying a roof freshener and some meds.\nThe said friend sprayed the room freshener like he entered some kind of toxic lab, and without the spray, it was nearly impossible to stay within the walls.\n\"Goddamn, what's with the smell of ramen and honey? What kind of shit mix are you consuming these days?!\" The short brown-haired boy sat down after making some space on the couch and looked at the person, once a handsome guy, now looking nothing more than a homeless hippy.\n\"No one invited you, Harry.\" The said hippy grumbled before he pulled another slice of pizza and roughly stuffed it inside his mouth.\nThe other one, named Harry, looked at his friend before signing, \"Seriously dude? Just a break up it all took for you to get detached from the world and play emo? I mean, it wasn't the first time you had a break-up, Luke.\"\nLuke scoffed, \"It's not just break up, man, it was all too fucked up back home. It was getting hectic so I decided to take a break.\" Luke responded as he focused back on his game.\nHarry cringed upon seeing what Luke was playing, \"You really are playing some otome now? At least go for some RPG or something.\"\nLuke heaved a sigh, \"Tried and finished most of it. This one is slightly different and annoying. The number of characters it offers, without letting them become monotonous, is intriguing.\"\nHarry shook his head, \"But still dude? It's basically all romance in the game. Are you that desperate?\"\nLuke smirked, \"Couldn't find love in real life, so satiating fantasies through fiction type of shit.\"\nHarry chuckled before asking, \"Are you coming with me for the reunion?\"\nLuke raised his brows before pausing the game and asking, \"This sudden reunion?\"\nHarry looked exasperated, \"How can you forget, man? Miss Milli is retiring today.\"\nLuke's eyes widened before he turned his eyes toward the calendar…and found the months hadn't switched.\nHe took his phone and looked at the date, and indeed today was the day.\nLuke looked at the game…he was just about to reach the finish. But well, not like he was playing for the last time, and looking at Harry, he knew if he didn't get up now, a mini battle arc might begin.\nLuke got up and said, \"Wait for me. It will take twenty minutes.\"\nHarry grumbled before he laid down over the bundle of clothes and tissue paper lying on the couch.\nWait…tissue papers?!\n—----**-------\nAfter about half an hour, Luke came out of his room, his beard shaved, hair combed, and instead of oversized clothes, he wore a formal suit now.\n\"Man, talk about transformation.\" Harry couldn't help but compliment as he looked at the hippy who now seemed a little presentable.\nThey soon left the apartment and headed toward the venue where the gathering was arranged. It wasn't very far away, that's why they reached before time.\n\"Hey, Luke. Long time, mate.\" There were many who recognized Luke, given he was on the rugby team and someone who had friends in each section.\nHe wasn't extremely popular, but from each group, at least one could recognize him.\n\"Hey, guy. How is it going, Eric?\" Luke then got busy chatting with others, and most of them were asking where he was and all.\nJust before high school graduation, Luka disappeared, and now, six months later, he showed his face.\nMany people knew the reason and that was his break up. However, naturally, no one mentioned it.\nUntil….\n\"Monica is here.\" Someone from the group said, and everyone turned towards the entrance from where a lovely black-haired girl entered…with a guy beside her.\nLuke didn't turn towards her and just continued to enjoy his drink. Harry, who was just beside him, said, \"Goddamn, she has turned hot after breaking up with you.\"\nLuke dryly smiled, \"Thanks for adding the last part.\"\nHarry smiled, and while patting his back, he said, \"Anytime, mate.\"\nPeople began murmuring and gathering around the girl. Monica was currently dating some hotshot from college. Naturally, a beautiful girl and a handsome man would attract others' attention.\nHowever, what they failed to notice was Monica's fleeting gaze on Luke.\nHer smile froze whenever she turned her eyes to him and found him completely ignoring her.\nIt wasn't that Luke didn't feel her looking at him, but he was just too tired with all this to care about her.\nFortunately, soon their teacher arrived and everyone's attention turned towards her.\nNot so long after the celebration began, and everyone started boasting about the universities they got, Luka left the venue.\nHe texted Harry that he was returning home since the atmosphere of the inside was too suffocating.\n'Forget it, I will meet the teacher some other time…'\nCrushing the remnant of the cigarette under his foot, Luka advanced towards the street, hoping to get a bus back home.\nHe was just standing there, looking at his phone, when suddenly he heard a familiar voice from behind,\n\"Luke?\"\nLuke didn't have to turn to know who it was, so he just turned to his left, intending to walk away when suddenly she ran towards him, \"Wait! Please.\"\nLuke rolled his eyes, \"Don't you have a boyfriend now? Why are you chasing after your ex?\"\nHis harsh words made the girl flinch.\nSeriously, the way she lowers her eyes and bites her lips makes his heart accelerate. But unlike before, he now can control his emotions and retain an indifferent front.\nVery timidly she said, \"I wanted to tell you…why I broke up with you.\"\nLuke heaved a long sigh, exposing how unwilling he was, but still Monica continued,\n\"It was because…I realized the love you carry for me…I knew I won't ever be able to reciprocate your feelings. I felt I don't dese-\"\n\"That you don't deserve me. And that I deserve someone better, so to not make me sad, you broke off, right? I have heard that so many times that now I don't need to know the reason behind breakups.\"\nMonica lowered her eyes, as she slowly muttered, \"But it's true Luke….I knew I would hurt you someday-\"\n\"So you moved up the event, I guess?\"\nMonica bit her lower lip and with teary eyes, she asked, \"Can you forgive me? Please? We still can be friends….\"\nLuke chuckled which soon turned into laughter.\nThis was so…cliche!\n\"Look, Monica, it's not necessary for you to try and be kind and good to everyone. I have accepted the fact that you don't deserve me, so let's end this right here. Bye.\"\nLuke was seriously tired and frustrated with this conversation…..why did she have to strike up a conversation with him in the first place? Luke never bothered her after the breakup, and once he decided that it was over, he never cared about how and why they broke up.\n*HONK* *HONK*\n'Does she have no life? Why come all the way to talk about the past?'\n*HONK* *HONK*\n'You deserve better, eh? Why not? That's the first time I have heard that lame a** excuse '\n*HONK* *HONK*\nMaybe it was because he was too occupied with his thoughts; he never noticed the truck coming in his direction.\nAnd when he looked up,\n'Truck-sama?'\nLuke tilted his head in confusion, unsure how a truck ended up in an alley, but his curiosity was never answered.\n**DHAK**\nAt the age of eighteen, Luke died in a truck accident.\n—-------**----------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 2: Chapter 1- The Villainess\nThe concept of reincarnation was not new to Luke. He has\nread and played games in which reincarnation was the most basic theme.\nHowever, just like anyone else, he didn't think he would be experiencing reincarnation for real at some point\nThe rumors of being isekai-d after getting hit by a truck weren't fake. Take Luke for an example.\nWhen he died, he was a tall guy of about 6'3 and a rugged build, given he was quite into sports. But now, looking at himself in the mirror, all Luke could gaze at was a teenager with golden blond hair and oceanic blue eyes.\nGone were the tanned skin and wide shoulders. All he could look at was lean physique and pristine white skin.\nHe had been staring at himself in the mirror for the past ten or so minutes and did everything to wake himself up if he was in a dream. However, even after the nth attempt, he couldn't shake himself off his sleep.\nAs such, only one conclusion remains.\n'I have reincarnated…and no one else but as a character of 'Star Destiny.''\nStar Destiny was the same game Luke was playing before his friend came knocking on his door to tell him about the reunion. The otome game with a female protagonist and action along with romance as its main genre.\nThis world was different from Earth since there were things like magic and swords. Unlike the world he comes from, this world works on a Monarchical system and there are things like monsters and dungeons in this world.\nTruth be told, it was a dream for every isekai fan to be born into a world like this. To gain blessings, fight monsters, and build their own harem. However, Luke couldn't think of such things.\nAfter all, neither he was the protagonist nor was he overpowered.\nHe was the Second Prince of the Kingdom—Austin von Eryndor—where this academy was built, and also, one of the potential male targets of the heroine.\nYes, the protagonist has a reverse harem, and now, Luke could become a part of that harem.\n'Like hell!' Luke has no intention of joining that little gang and fawn over the dramatic protagonist.\nThe protagonist is a trouble magnet and the type of girl who leaves her opponent alive, just because everyone deserves a second chance kind of sh*t.\nIn the first place, it sounded so creepy to be a part of a group that has no other role than to flirt with a girl and get jealous of other harem members. It wasn't that Luke was prejudiced towards reverse harem, he hates polygamy as a whole.\nJust stick to one goddamn partner if you love them!\nLuke only played this game because it had interesting characters(not the harem members) and the fight scenes were badass. However, little did he think that he would reincarnate into the same game he was playing.\n'I didn't even finish it…' Luke was around that preparation arc before the final battle. So he somehow knows all the locations of the artifacts and legendary items. And also, he has some information about the final boss, which surely would be quite helpful.\n'But still…I have mediocre skill and not much considerable potential…' Sure, there were some merits of being the Prince; however, as a person, he wasn't strong enough to even come in the top ten.\nLuke sat down on the bed and thought closely.\nHe didn't have any idea at what point he had reincarnated and how much time remained before the graduation—around that time the final battle occurred—that's why his current priority lies in knowing about the world around him.\n**KNOCK**\nHearing the knock, Luke(Austin) made his way toward the door and asked, \"Who is it?\"\n\"It's me, master, Sebastian.\"\nHearing that voice, Luke took a deep breath. He doesn't have Austin's memories and facing this man under these circumstances would be disastrous.\n\"Ah, I am changing. What is it?\" He asked, making some excuses. He couldn't meet Sebastian since the man was too observant and had known Austin since his childhood.\n\"The trial is about to begin in half an hour and the headmaster has summoned you.\"\nTrials? Trials!\n\"Ah, okay. Umm, has anyone decided to fight from the other side?\" Just to be on the safe side, Austin added.\n\"No, young master. No one is willing to fight for Lady Valerie.\"\nHis suspicion was confirmed, \"Okay, you can go. I will be there.\"\nOnce the butler left Austin heaved a sigh. He knew it.\nThe trials of villainess—Valerie Hawthorne—the villainess of the story and someone who would prove to be one of the biggest obstacles for the Protagonist.\nNot only is she strong but exceptionally beautiful as well. A sharp tongue and a strict personality. And because of her tragic end, many people, including Luke, like her more than the Protagonist.\nShe has a bad past and an unfortunate future. In all honesty, she suffers more than the protagonist ever had. And in the end, her death was very cruel.\nMany of the gamers thought she deserved it after how much she caused the protagonist trouble, but Luke held a different opinion.\nValerie was snatched from her love by the protagonist. Naturally, anyone would turn into a villain.\nTruth be told, it was Valerie with whom Luke could sympathize.\nAnd now, she is getting framed for the crime of breaking the Spirit Shard—a weapon connected with one's soul—of the main heroine.\nThis trial is the beginning of Valerie's downfall and he, Austin, would play a massive role in this event.\nLooking at himself in the mirror, Luke couldn't help but scoff, \"What a scumbag I am to support a different woman while my fiancée is in trouble…\"\nValerie is Austin's fiancée, and not only Austin takes the Protagonist's side today, but he also insults Valerie in front of everyone before breaking off the engagement.\nYes, an actual scumbag\nBut now that Luke has taken over,\n'Like hell, I would let the canon repeat.'\n—------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 3: Chapter 2- Trial(1)\nAustin didn't have any idea whether he would regain his memories or not. He was still the same Luke who belonged to a planet called Earth and died after being hit by a truck.\nThanks to the fact that he pays attention to the details provided in the game—under the assumption that the dialogues and details would somehow help him in the future—he could act like the Prince for now.\nHe was currently in the second year of the academy, with eighteen months remaining before graduation. Around that time the\nmain villain would show up.\nHowever, the current arc would pave the downfall of the villainess named Valerie\nYesterday, the Protagonist and Valerie got into a fight. Valerie is the strongest Aurakin in the academy.\nAurakin is just like a knight or warrior, however, in place of normal weapons, the students of this academy and around ten percent of the population can use a special type of tool called Spirit Shard.\nValerie is strong, and leagues above the Protagonist as of now. As such, when the confrontation occurred and the Protagonist lifted her weapon in a fit of rage, Valeria protected herself and broke the Protagonist's Spirit Shard.\nBreaking someone's Spirit Shard while you are a student is outright illegal and Valerie broke the law.\nNaturally, all the harem members were displeased with the Villainess. And Austin, the man who should have stood by his fiancée's side at times like these, also supported the other party.\nAnd not only that, Austin even humiliated her and broke off the engagement.\nValerie then gets criticised by other students, the teachers also ignore her, and at some point, a harem member of the Protagonist even framed her—resulting in her expulsion. Then, there was no mention of her for a long time, and when she appeared, Valerie was one of the Generals of the main boss.\nThrough any route Luke picked, he couldn't stop Valerie from meeting such a miserable fate.\nHe actually sympathizes with her because she did her best to maintain her relationship with the man she adores, but…\n\"Young Master? Are you unwell?\" Hearing Sebastian's voice, Austin was shook off his daze before he said,\n\"No, I am quite fine. Anyway, have you written what I just told you?\" The white-haired man nodded before Austin looked at the notepad and gave a satisfied nod.\nJust as he picked up the notepad, the butler couldn't help but ask, \"Are you sure about this master? Expressing the event in such details might put Lady Valerie into more trouble.\"\nOne could sense that the old man pitied the girl and it was natural. Valerie and Austin were childhood friends so the old man has seen her growing up as well.\nAfter entering the academy, Austin and Valerie drifted apart, but for the butler, they both were still the same.\nAustin sighed, \"Whatever I will do today, is for the best.\"\nSaying so the blond Prince walked out of the room and headed towards the Principal's office, where the others were waiting.\nIt was already evening and there weren't many students around. However, everyone was aware of the incident regarding Valerie that's why students were glancing and whispering about Austin as well.\nThe short walk from the dormitory to the main building came to an end, and Austin was standing right before the Headmaster's office.\n'Let's do this.'\n**KNOCK**\nJust as he knocked, the door was opened from the other side, revealing the face of a familiar teacher who was a named character in the game.\nAfter all, he is also a potential love interest.\n\"Professor Morkel.\" Austin greeted the man with a nod before stepping inside the office\nThere were quite many people inside, including the Headmaster, Vice-headmaster, and Austin's homeroom teacher.\nOn the left side, surrounded by four males, was a single pink-haired girl who looked at Austin with a soft smile.\nThe main heroine of this world—Rhea.\nAustin gave her a short nod before his eyes turned towards the person who stood all alone and silent.\nHer curly violet hair was neatly braided. Her sharp violet eyes were drawn to the ground. High nose, full red lips, and a perfectly shaped body. She possessed a beauty worth getting obsessed over.\nAustin glanced at both girls and couldn't understand that even based on beauty, how Austin could choose the pink head over such a beautiful girl.\nValerie's head was leaning down and in her hand, there was a small wooden box which she held carefully.\nAustin knew what was inside the box. Their engagement ring.\nValerie knows that today, Austin will annul the engagement.\n\"We were waiting for you, Austin.\" The headmaster, Philius Croweb, stated.\nThe old man say in his seat with his back straight and eyes carrying no particular emotion.\nThose who know the man closely could tell that he was upset about the fact that within the boundaries of the academy, such a great tragedy transpired.\nAustin gave him a firm nod before stepping forward.\n\"Now that we all have gathered, I would like to start the hearing.\" Morkel began as he stood beside Austin and continued,\n\"Yesterday, in the common hall, a major incident transpired in which student Rhea and student Valerie were involved. Just like everyone, student Rhea went there with her friends to enjoy a peaceful dinner, when suddenly student Rhea tripped and the tea in her hand spilled on student Valarie's gown.\"\nTaking a pause and after ensuring that everyone's attention was on him, the bespectacled man added, \"After that, student Valerie began bad-mouthing student Rhea, making fun of the fact that she was an orphan and the absence of her parents had turned student Rhea into a savage being.\"\nNo one disagreed with it since it was true and everyone heard Valerie shouting at Rhea yesterday.\nJust remembering it made the pink-haired girl's eyes well up with tears.\nThe tall boy behind her rested his hands on Rhea's shoulders and consoled her, \"It's okay Rhea, she will be punished for what she has done,\" As the giant boy spoke those words, he glared at Valerie.\nHowever, the violet-haired didn't notice the glare…more like ever since she entered the office; her head was down, and she seemed listless.\nMorkel added, \"In retaliation, student Rhea just summoned her Soul Shard…and it snapped when Student Valerie attacked her with the clear intention of damaging her Shard.\"\nStanding before the Headmaster, Morkel concluded, \"In my opinion, it was all too well planned by student Valerie. She first provoked Rhea and when student Rhea reacted, she took the opportunity to end her life! And for that crime, I beg the headmaster to take the necessary action.\"\nOn a strong note, he finished.\nAfter that, the room falls under silence, as the older one sitting behind the desk turns towards the blond and says,\n\"Is there anything you want to add, Austin?\"\nEveryone in the room, including Valerie, thought that Austin would surely say something to insult Valerie. He had the right opportunity, and this time, even Rhea won't stop him.\nHowever, under everyone's astonished gazes, Austin stood before Valerie and held her face\nThe warmth of his hands and the fact he behaved so tenderly with her made Valerie's eyes widen.\n\"Tell me something,\" Austin began, \"Did you intend to kill Rhea?\"\nMorkel frowned; however, before he could have said anything, the headmaster raised his hand and stopped him.\nEveryone was dumbfounded by the sudden action but more than anyone, Valerie was completely speechless by his action.\nHowever, under his warm gaze, she couldn't stop herself from saying the truth, \"No…\".\n—--------**----------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

He was concerned.\nFor her?\nHow…is that possible?\nValerie has hurt the person Austin likes…almost killed her…and he is…looking out for her.\nShe believed this was either a dream or a false hope he was giving to make her feel worse.\nShe has lost every hope to get back with the man she ever allowed herself to adore. That's why, she took off the only connection which gave their relationship a name.\nTheir engagement ring.\nIn those few moments when he held her face, numerous possibilities flashed through her mind…however, none of them were positive.\nBut a very flickering and dim flame was still ignited in the corner of her mind…what if, her lord takes stand for her here? What if, when the world is against her, he shields her from them?\nNo…that would be too much. Just the very fact he looked at her so gently after so long was hefty enough for her to shed some tears of joy.\nThis much was enough. She shouldn't hope for more.\n...\nAll Austin could see in her eyes was hopelessness and pain. She was suffering from the betrayal and grief Austin bestowed upon her.\nHeaving a sigh, he stepped back and turned towards the vice-principal,\n\"Sir Hayden, can I ask you to use your Soul Shard to draw an Absolute Truth circle around me?\"\nThe statement made many people around them surprised, as Morkel said,\n\"You don't need to go to such lengths, Austin. Just tell everything that happened.\"\nAustin looked at the man before informing him, \"What I am about to say is true but might not be liked by everyone present here. So to save ourselves from needless waste of time, arguing over who is right and who is not, let Professor Hayden use his skill?\"\nHe stated the best option to provide the credibility of the evidence he was about to show them.\nHayden glanced at the Headmaster before stepping forward and summoning his Soul Shard in the form of a lance.\nHe planted the butt of the Shard on the ground just a few inches before Austin and started to go around him—creating a visible and shining circle around the blond student.\nStepping back, Hayden announced, \"Now, if you say the truth, the circle will hold the silver shade. And if you lie, we will know.\"\nAustin gave a thankful nod to the man before looking at the Headmaster,\n\"Sir, I intend to recount every word exchanged during that brief confrontation in full detail. If Valerie or Rhea believes I have misspoken or included anything inaccurately in my account, please feel free to interrupt me without hesitation.\"\nNeither of them said anything but all Austin needed was the Headmaster's nod, which he received.\nHe took out the document he prepared before coming here, with Sebastian's help.\n\"At thirty minutes past five, Rhea, along with Rudolph and Parkinson, entered the common hall. After taking several dishes from the counter, the three of them began advancing towards a vacant table. While Rudolph and Parkinson were carrying the heavy trays, Rhea was only allowed to carry the light tray on which three tea cups were placed.\"\nLooking up, he glanced at the group on his left before asking, \"Is there anything I am missing here?\"\nThere was a surprise on Rhea's face as she asked, \"How do you know such details…you weren't with us?\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"That doesn't concern now, does it? Just tell me if I am right or not?\"\n\"Why are you being so rude, Austin?\" Parkinson spat, his face growing dark in displeasure.\n\"I assume there is nothing rude in what he asked, Student Park.\" The Headmaster's voice brought a sudden pause to the growing tension.\nRhea exhaled an audible breath before nodding, \"Yes, it's true. Every bit of it.\"\nAustin nodded before he turned his head towards the Headmaster, \"Then suddenly while student Rhea was about to cross the seat where Valerie sat, she tripped—possibly accidentally—and spilled the tea on her gown.\"\n\"What do you mean, possibly? I accidentally tripped.\" Rhea frowned; she couldn't understand why Austin was siding with that woman all of a sudden.\nAustin remained indifferent, \"We will see about it. But for now, you spilled the tea on her and Valerie stood up furiously and began wiping her dress. While she did so she said many things, among which she said something that hurt student Rhea awfully.\"\nNow here, Austin took a pause and looked intently at the paper; not wanting to miss a single word,\n\"'Have your parents not taught you any manners, you savage fool?!'\" He adopted a higher tone to let the emotion reflect in his voice.\nRhea clenched her teeth before adding, \"Yes, she said the exact same thing.\"\nAustin turned towards Valerie, and with her eyes on the ground, she gave a brief nod of affirmation.\nAustin returned his gaze back to the Headmaster before adding, \"So yes, she said that, and Rhea, in a fit of anger, summoned her Soul Shard. In the process—albeit unintentionally—she ended up tearing the side of her gown.\"\nLeaving a sigh, he said, \"And because of that, Valerie summoned her own soul shard, and without adjusting the strength, she attacked Rhea…and we all know the conclusion.\"\n\"What a joke! Just because one of her thousands of dresses got damaged, she attacked Rhea.\" Morkel stepped forward,\n\"You see now, headmaster? Student Valerie is unstable in the head-!!\" Morkel stopped talking as suddenly he felt a chilly gaze staring at him.\nMorkel frowned seeing Austin's gaze before he heard him saying, \"Be very careful of what you say, Morkel. Before a student of this academy, I am her fiancé. I will take any insult to her personally. So be very careful.\"\nThe tension grew in the room and not only Morkel but Parkinson and Rudolph were showing displeasure to the fact that someone was defending Valerie.\nAustin was protecting her.\n—-------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 5: Chapter 4- Trial(3)\nFiancée. He called her, his fiancée. Not 'woman' or 'You!' but…\nTears welled in her eyes as she stared at his wide back; numerous emotions were reflected in her tears as she bit her lips to refrain from sobbing.\nMorkel's jaw was moving, signifying that the guy was grinding his teeth furiously. Unintentionally he even released his aura, making Hayden frown, as he warned,\n\"Professor Morkel.\"\nThe bespectacled man heaved a sigh before giving a slight bow and saying,\n\"I apologize for the display, Sir Hayden, but the student has forgotten the fact that within the boundaries of this academy, every student is equal. So student Austin needs to be reminded that until he is studying here, he has to respect his professors.\"\nAustin scoffed but didn't say anything against that. Returning his attention to the supreme authority, he said,\n\"I apologize if I said something rude, but in my opinion, everyone has the right to present their views before any conclusion can be drawn. And if Professor Morkel threatens someone close to me because I said something, then it's natural for me to react, sir.\"\nAustin justified himself, and this time, the Headmaster supported him, \"Yes, I can understand. But Austin, I recommend you tame your aura.\"\nAustin was…genuinely surprised. He never realized that he released his aura. He doesn't even know how it feels to have magic.\nNaturally, he avoided showing any surprise and after giving a nod of affirmation, he continued.\n\"So yes, after her gown was damaged, Valerie reacted, and she had all the reason to do so.\"\nThis time Rudolph interjected, \"How does that work? Have you lost your mind, Austin? Can a dress make someone react so violently?\"\nThe opinion was shared by every single person except for Valerie and Austin in the room.\nTheir homeroom teacher, Cassie, also nodded, \"Yes, Austin. If it had been somewhere appropriate her reaction might have been justified. But Rhea only tore the side of her dress.\"\nEven the headmaster gave a nod to show that he was in support of the statement.\nParkinson smirked, 'Let's see how you defend that bitch now!'\nAustin heaved a sigh and turned towards the person who asked him the question.\nAustin's eyes drifted toward the dagger which Rudolph holstered at the side of his waist.\nPointing at it, he asked, \"I remember you got that dagger from your father as a symbol of courage and determination when you hunted a boar for the first time.\"\nRudolph's chest swelled with pride, \"Indeed.\"\nRhea frowned, unsure why the argument went in that direction, but naturally, to respect the Headmaster's words, she remained silent.\nAustin crossed his arms on his chest, and asked, \"What if someone dares to damage that dagger-\"\n\"I will kill them. Without hesitation or any fear of consequences.\" It was a bold statement from the teenager, considering his homeroom teacher, the vice-headmaster and the headmaster himself were present in the room\nHowever, considering how much Rudolph respected his father, such a reaction was to be expected.\nHayden was about to say something, but the Headmaster stopped him, knowing that Austin wanted the other one to retain the aggression.\nA very small smile formed on Austin's lips as he said, \"Just like that dagger is important to you, that gown is important to Valerie as well….because it was given by the person she adores the most.\"\nEveryone was perplexed; meanwhile, Rhea's eyes widened in shock since she never thought that Valerie reacted because of her fondness for the apparel she wore.\nTurning towards the Headmaster, Austin added, \"That gown was gifted by me and since yesterday marks the second anniversary of our engagement, sir, Valerie wore that dress to please me. It's another fact that I never went to meet her and disrespected her sentiments.\"\nNear the end his voice turned a little low, showing the regret he carried for ignoring his fiancée.\nValerie's face was tainted with tears—a sight that might have caused several students to faint in shock.\nThe cold and strict beauty can shed tears and show such a pitiful sight? Unbelievable.\nHeaving a sigh, the blond Prince concluded, \"From what I could see, sir, Valerie acted on impulse, but she never intended to cause such damage to Rhea. And about her comment regarding Rhea's parents—\"\nAustin turned towards the pinkhead before lowering his head, \"Then I apologize in her stead.\"\nEven Rudolph wasn't able to maintain his frown seeing the Prince lowering his head and for whom? The same fiancée whom he has ignored all his life?\nRhea was embarrassed as she hurriedly said, \"Please lift your head, Austin. I wasn't completely aware of the situation so I should be apologizing.\"\nMorkel frowned; this was not what was supposed to happen. He wanted the insane bitch to get punished, not Rhea actually lowering her head!\nHowever, before he or anyone else could have said nothing, the Headmaster finally stood up—garnering everyone's attention.\nWith his hands crossed behind his back, the old man said, \"After hearing the whole thing and realizing under what circumstances the two students acted, I have concluded that student Valerie will indeed be punished.\"\nAustin frowned, however, he didn't interrupt the man from continuing,\n\"However, considering Student Rhea was also in the wrong I won't charge Valerie with the same punishment which she should have been.\"\nTurning his gaze towards the violet-haired teenager, the older one said, \"For the next two weeks, you need to spend an extra hour with the previous disciplinary chief who is in third year and do whatever she tells you. It will help you realize the consequences of your impulsive decisions.\"\nValerie, now in a much better mood than how she came in, instantly lowered her head and accepted the punishment.\nThen the old man turned towards Rhea and said, \"Rhea, you will have to give an extra hour to our librarian, who will help you understand the meaning of tolerance and composure. He will teach you to control your anger.\"\n\"...I understand, sir.\" Rhea also bowed and accepted her punishment.\nThen suddenly Parkinson jumped in, \"Wait…are you just glossing over the fact that Rhea's soul was damaged?!\"\nIt was true; Soul Shard is the extension of one's soul and Valerie snapped it into two.\nAlong with lowered life expectancy, Rhea would face several more side effects of such damage.\nThe Headmaster heaved a sigh before saying, \"I have already informed the church; they will come and look at her case tomorrow.\"\nParkinson frowned—not happy with such leniency. However, before he could have said anything, Morkel pulled him back and grimly shook his head.\nThe teenager growled before he pursed his lips and glared at Austin.\nIf only he hadn't intervened…\n—-----**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 6: Chapter 5- Apology\nThe trials were over, and the results were just as he anticipated.\nCanonically, Valerie would have been suspended from attending classes for three months and the news of engagement annulment would have made her a laughing stock back home. Not to talk about, her father had to pay a hefty sum as compensation.\nThose moments she spends back at home, all alone, change her personality. She yearned for Austin and got betrayed by him. However, even after annulment she never stopped loving him. Even when she returned as a Parasyte General, she just desired to become one with Austin.\n… but all Valerie received was betrayal again.\nThe protagonist, Rhea, couldn't defeat Valerie head-on, so she used Austin to lure her…before stabbing Valerie in her back.\nSuch an unfortunate fate and all because an idiot failed to notice the feelings of his fiancée.\n….\nThe headmaster asked Morkel to stay and told the others to leave.\nAustin, along with others, walked out of the office at once.\nThe blond Prince could feel the shy gaze of his fiancée on his back. It seems she couldn't bring herself to walk beside him.\n'Haa…what an adorable girl…'\nAustin was about to ask Valerie something when suddenly Rhea asked, \"Austin…can you accompany me for a bit? I want to talk to you.\"\nHearing that, Rudolph and Parkinson's faces darkened. Even without looking at her, Austin could tell that Valerie's expression shifted.\nRhea looked serious and Austin could guess what she had to say. However,\n\"Let's chat tomorrow. I want to stay with Valerie for the time being.\" As he said, Austin held Valerie's hand and urged her to stand beside him.\nThe violet-haired looked at him with her sharp eyes turning round in astonishment.\nAustin glanced at her and instantly looked away. The way she was looking up at him was too damn adorable.\n'Gah…control Luke…you can't pet the adorable creature here…control….'\nRhea glanced at their connected hands, a frown dancing on her forehead before she nodded and wordlessly walked away.\nParkinson immediately followed her while Rudolph remained standing.\nWith his eyes narrowed, he said, \"What happened to you? You never spoke so indifferently with Rhea before.\"\nAustin sighed, a little surprised that the big man cares about things like emotions and sentiments, before he said, \"Look Rudolph, I was just stating the fact without showing any partiality. If it seems rude, then you should say sorry.\"\nRudolph nodded, \"Okay sorry. See you later.\"\nSaying so, the taller one walked away, leaving a dumbfounded Valerie behind. She couldn't understand what just happened so she looked back at her lord.\nAustin smirked; easy to manipulate that guy is.\nHe looked at the lovely princess beside him—urging her to lower her head immediately—before asking, \"Should we walk around a bit?\"\nNaturally, she didn't disagree.\n….\nThe two of them left the main building and Austin led the girl to the garden on the front side of the campus. He was not aware of things located in the academy, so he just wandered mindlessly with Valerie by his side.\nThey were no longer holding hands as Austin kept his hands hidden inside his pocket and walked a few steps ahead of his fiancée.\n\"Why didn't you stand up for yourself back there?\" Austin asked, prompting her to raise her head and look at him.\nValerie then slowly lowered her eyes and muttered, \"I…was wrong, and by remaining silent, I was accepting my mistake.\"\nAustin slowed his pace until he was beside her before asking her with a smile, \"So you regret reacting when she damaged the dress I gifted you?\"\n\"Never…!\" Her voice pitched a bit high, but soon she calmed down and relayed her honest thoughts,\n\"I…would react the same if someone tried to damage what's precious to me. However, I should have been careful when attacking her.\"\nSeeing her downcast gaze and her fragile self, a sense of protectiveness was born in his heart for this girl.\nHe got to know this girl just an hour ago, yet, her situation and pitiful self made his heart melt.\n\"I was there, Valerie.\" Austin began, his eyes now looking at the darkening sky.\nValerie looked at his charming face as she heard him saying, \"I was there all along…when you entered the common hall to the point when the fight broke out. I saw everything.\"\nTaking a pause and letting a weary sigh seep through his lips, he added, \"Initially I was angry that you attacked Rhea. She could have lost her life…but then last night I found a picture album of ours that made me remember several things.\"\nAlthough he was making up things, Austin made sure that he had a photo album with Valerie.\n\"The person who became my first friend despite my worth and status in the royal family. Someone who never judged me for my abilities but looked at my true self. Someone who encouraged me to move forward and healed my wounds when I got hurt.\"\nWith a smile, he looked at the girl, who didn't steal her gaze this time, before adding, \"People came to know this better version of Austin after I became a student here. But the person who made me the man I am right now is you, Val.\"\nValerie's feet slowly came to a pause and so did Austin's as they gazed into each other's eyes.\nTears rolled down her eyes as she stared at Austin with numerous complicated emotions swirling in her mind.\nShe thought…he forgot all of it. She thought she was no longer needed. She assumed he didn't need her so he would throw her away.\nHowever, when Austin took out the ring from the box and slid it back where it was, she knew,\n\"Please forgive me for what I have done, Val.\"\n…she knew that he needed her. Just like how she needed him.\n—-------**--------\nA/N:- Not even once I stopped smiling during their conversation. Save the book in your library, and a big thank you to those who wrote a review even though the book has yet to hit ten chapters.\nEspecially in this phase, every collection, every review, and every comment helps. So big thank you to all of you..",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Chapter 6- System\n*Click*\nValerie was back in her room. Standing silently with her back pressed against the door.\nThere were so many thoughts in her mind that she just…became blank.\nMany things happened today and Valerie couldn't decide what she should think first.\nLooking at her hand, she found the ring which she painfully took out today, was placed back there once again.\nA soft smile adorned her lips as she pressed her hand against her face and tried to feel the lingering warmth of her beloved.\nWhen she left her room this afternoon, she couldn't have ever anticipated such a result.\nHer lord…didn't abandon her. There was still some hope that they could become one, once again.\n'I am so happy…' Tears rolled down her eyes as she continued to smile helplessly. Falling to her knees she held the hand on her chest and allowed herself to release all the stress she had accumulated.\nThe elation of getting back this ring was not something she could explain to anyone.\nFor a long time, Valerie remained sitting there, crying tears of joy.\nAlthough she didn't want to be too hopeful, she had a faint belief that after today, things between her and her lord would change.\n'I pray…that even if it is fake, you keep looking at me, my lord.'\n—-------**---------\nAfter parting ways with Valerie, Austin returned to his dorm, where a smiling old man awaited\n\"Young master…\" Faintly, Austin could see tears in Sebastian's eyes, which didn't surprise him.\nAustin smiled faintly, \"I knew you were expecting something else from me but I am not that big of a scumbag, Sebastian.\" Well, originally, he was.\nThe older man wiped his tears with a handkerchief, before bowing his head, \"I apologize for misunderstanding you, my lord.\"\nAustin patted his soldier, \"Don't bow your head like this.\"\nAustin walked towards his bed while pulling away his necktie as he asked, \"What about the visit to the Capital?\"\nEarlier, when Austin was going through his documents while taking Sebastian's help to prepare the dialogues, Austin noticed that he had marked the day, exactly a week later, to return home.\nSebastian nodded, \"Yes, my lord. On the occasion of your birthday, Your Majesty has arranged a celebration back home and naturally, you are invited.\"\nAustin wanted to scoff; a celebration for him? Yeah, what a joke.\nSebastian sensed the disdain in his master's eyes, making the older one feel a little guilty.\n\"Young Master…it's purely a coincidence that…\"\n\"Yeah, I know. You can go now.\" Austin waved at him as he unbuttoned his shirt.\nThe older male lowered his head and with a grieving look, he left the room.\nAustin heaved a sigh; he purposely showed that he was disgusted about this whole celebration, but actually, he was not interested at all.\nThe fact is, Prince Austin is a useless prince and someone who was spoiled by his mother until…his elder brother, whom they thought was dead, returned one day. And the day he returned coincidentally was Austin's birthday.\nSo every year, rather than celebrating Austin's birthday, people gather around to celebrate the fact that a more responsible and strong Prince returned that day. A mini-arc is about to begin in seven days since the Protagonist would be present there as well…and as one could expect, the first Prince would become infatuated with her.\n'Seriously, pink hair is such a red flag…' He was slightly prejudiced since his first girlfriend was also pinheaded.\nAlthough his favorite anime character is also pink-haired, his hatred for his first girlfriend is stronger.\n*Click*\nOnce Austin locked the door, he sat on the bed and said,\n'Now then…system, rise and shine.'\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations host! You have altered the plot significantly; providing a kick-start to your journey!]\nHe received the notification when he slid the ring on Valerie's finger…but that moment was so precious and beautiful that he didn't pay attention to the system at all.\nBut not like he would keep ignoring the golden spoon.\n[THE PROGRESS-REWARD SYSTEM]\n'What a grand name…'\n[The system allows the host to track the progress the host would make in several fields—romance, plot, strength, achievement, hatred, trickery. Until the host continues to progress, the system will provide worthy rewards. And through rewards, the host can alter progression as well.]\nAustin hummed, and while scratching his chin he asked,\n'You mean through rewards I can progress in one of those fields? However, will that affect the physical world and other people?'\n[No, host. The progression in question here is the personal achievements of the host.]\n'I don't understand but continue.' Austin gave the green flag as he sat cross-legged on the bed.\nAustin knows that Sebastian reports to his father that's why he was talking to the system through thoughts. God knows what kind of surveillance artifact guy might have planted in the room.\n[Ding!]\n[The current progression:]\n[12.5/100]\n[Stage-> 1]\n[Upon reaching every hundred points, the host would ascend to the next stage. Progressing in each stage would grant rewards, and upon breaking to the next stage grants mega rewards.]\n[Ding!]\n[Upon reaching the first threshold the host has received a reward!]\n[Open: Y/N]\nAustin looked at the blue and black screen closely and pondered for a few minutes.\nIf his mind is working right, then he just needs to make progress in any field, and the bar will continue to move up.\nAnd every time he crosses a certain point in the mark, he would receive rewards.\nNice.\n'Hmm…open the reward.'\n[Ding!]\n[Memory transfer!]\n[The host can regain all the memories of the previous owner of the body!]\n[Transfer: Y/N]\nAustin's expression turned blank, 'Tell me something, the great system, shouldn't I get this by default? Why as a reward?'\nHe was mildly annoyed that he wasn't getting an actual reward.\n[Ding!]\n[There is an option to dispose of the reward!]\n[Dispose: Y/N]\n'....'\n—------**--------\nA/N:- Savage system!

      "content": "Chapter 8: Chapter 7- Memories\nAustin was currently lying on his bed with his hands clasped behind his bed. There was a very bored look on his face which explains how he perceived the memories of the original owner.\nAustin was the eldest child in the family until he turned eight and his older brother returned.\nSince birth, Austin has been a good child—loved by his parents, had several friends, and a lovely childhood friend who later became his fiancée.\nValerie and Austin's relationship was quite good till a decent period. They always remained together. In those memories, Austin could see that the silent girl actually admired Austin for whatever he did.\nBelonging to a ducal house, Valerie was provided with the resources that allowed her to attend the same classes as Austin. They were inseparable.\nHowever, at the age of seven, when every child awakens their Soul Shard, Austin awakens a very small stick-like object that cannot be regarded as a weapon in the first place.\nAustin was…disheartened. Although he was consoled and told by his parents that Soul Shards grow with time, he couldn't believe that he awakened such a weak Shard.\nAnd to rub salt in his wounds, Valerie awakened a spear that shone brightly and had an edge that not even many veteran warriors possess.\nAfter that day, Austin began to distance himself from Valerie.\nAlthough they both trained and participated in spars, Valerie was praised more; not only by her own parents but by Austin's as well.\nHis jealousy grew slowly, and to add more misfortune to his account, his elder brother returned a year later.\nHe was only one year old when he got stolen away by the maid who used to work for his mother. And when he returned he was a veteran warrior with a sword as his Soul Shard.\nSword—the symbol of courage and strength.\nThe new Prince immediately became everyone's favorite. Austin's parents also focused on him more, given they wanted to make up for him for the lost time. And Austin distanced himself from his family.\nHe began to hate Valerie and his elder brother slowly…seeing both of them as those who stole him from his happiness.\nAfter entering the academy, Austin met Rhea…a girl who didn't care about his worth or status. After they clashed into a battle, she offered her hand to him without any hidden intent. She just wanted to become friends with him.\nAnd that…moved his-\n\"*Yawn* what a boring progression.\" Austin yawned and stretched his body.\nThe original user was blind. He misinterpreted Valerie's intention to become stronger.\n'But well, now that I am here I will make sure to talk things out and clear every single misunderstanding between us…'\nHis intention towards Valerie was clear; he wanted to make her happy. And naturally, he would save her from her unfortunate fate as well.\nGetting up from the bed, Austin decided to do some light exercise before taking a bath and changing into his uniform.\n\"Hup!\" Unlike his previous life, where he became a lazy bum while lazing around the whole day, Austin's body felt much lighter and healthier.\nDespite his crybaby habits, Austin has a habit of working out every day.\nLeaning forward, Austin stood on his hands easily, feeling the energy in his body being utilized efficiently.\nHe lifted the left hand off the ground and was now just on a single palm, yet no struggle could be seen.\nJumping back on his feet, Austin first decided to see how many push-ups he could pull.\n\"1…2….3…\" He began…and went on and on. He didn't feel tired even after a hundred.\n\"Haah…normal workout won't do.\" People here are superhumans who utilize a special kind of energy called Aura, which they can use to strengthen their bodies and enhance their speed.\nAnd then comes the most precious gift of an awakened.\n\"Frostfangs.\" A pair of crystal white daggers appeared in his hands, which were his Soul Shards.\nThe jewel of a hunter, not a King, they say. However, in Austin's opinion, daggers are much more efficient when it comes to fighting at close range.\nThe stronger one's soul is, the Shard will continue to grow. If it breaks, you are doomed. And if it morphs, you are hailed.\nThere are stages of Soul Shards. Austin's Shard has yet to go through upgrades, so he is basically Primary Awakened.\nThe Protagonist's blade awakened twice, so yes, she is strong. Not only that, she aced all the practical examinations and was ranked top as a freshman.\nAbout Valerie? Her Shard went through four transformations and the girl was so strong that the Headmaster sent her through a special assessment, where she was told to fight the instructors.\nHer scores were so great that she wasn't listed in the rankings, given her scores would have easily made several students disheartened and lost their motive to become number one.\n\"Haha~ain't my wife the strongest?\"\nWithout the help of the system, Austin's growth would be limited. So he would progress in the field of strength and see what kind of rewards he could get.\nFor now, he had an important meeting with an important person. So he didn't waste time and took a quick bath before changing into his school uniform.\nA white shirt with black traces down the buttons and sleeves. Black formal trousers that reached his ankles. And a pair of black shoes. Looking at himself after combing his hair, Austin couldn't help but compliment himself,\n\"I do look good…but still need a little muscle.\"\nTurning around he took his bag and left his room.\n\"Good morning, sir.\" Outside his room, the same white-haired old man awaited with a friendly smile on his face.\n\"Morning, Sebas. I will be having breakfast in the common hall. Please bring the newspaper there.\"\nThe butler lowered his head as Austin made his way out of the dormitory.\nThe confidence in his voice stems from the memories he received. Now Luke and Austin were both the same person.\nLeaving the dormitory he approached the main building where on the base floor was located the common hall.\nAnd outside the common hall, he spotted her.\nStanding in a corner, doing well to hide herself, the violet-haired girl continued to peek at him.\nAustin grinned; so, a breakfast date, is it?\n—-------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 9: Chapter 8- Threat?\n'Is it really okay to wait? Will he get mad? Should I just go back? Am I being a nuisance? Will he be pleased-I don't know…' These were the thoughts that clogged her mind as Valerie remained standing before the common hall.\nShe doesn't even know if Austin would have breakfast in the common hall or his office like usual. However, she came here early in the morning to wait for him…and was hoping she could sit near him.\nThis step was taken after a lot of thinking and self-conflict.\nShe assumed that since her Lord had taken a step towards their relationship, it would be wise for her not to step back and make him feel bad…or was Valerie just being pushy?\nShe doesn't know!\n\"Ah!\" A soft exclamation left her lips when she noticed him…advancing towards the common hall while looking nothing less than a heartthrob.\nValerie was mesmerized looking at her beloved, who, despite wearing the same uniform as others, extruded a charm that forbade her from looking at anyone else.\nHer eyes were meant to drown in his charm.\n\"Good morning?\" Before Valerie could realize it, Austin was standing right in front of her while waving his hand slowly.\nHer expression stiffened as she realized that he must have sensed her inappropriate gaze.\n\"G-Good morning…\" She might have bitten her tongue.\nNot good!\nAustin chuckled seeing that reaction from the lovely lady before he offered, \"Shall we go inside and have breakfast?\"\n\"T-Together?\"\nAustin slightly tilted his head, \"If you don't mind I would love to share the table with you.\"\n\"I don't! Umm…please lead the way.\" Her cheeks were burning due to embarrassment, and before she could show any more unlady-like traits, she lowered her head and asked him.\nAustin was smiling ear to ear, seeing that reaction. Ain't she just adorable?\nThey walked inside the common hall in silence, while being watched by others. They must be interested in knowing how someone who detested Valerie until yesterday, was now accompanying her in the morning.\n\"Did you sleep well last night?\" Austin asked in a whisper as he slowed down his pace to match hers.\nValerie slowly nodded, \"Somehow.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"I wasn't able to sleep much…thinking about you and us.\"\nValerie was rendered speechless. Just the thought of her Lord thinking about her while lying down on his bed…made her blush.\nThey were whispering a few words to each other while walking towards the food counter when suddenly a commotion broke out.\n\"Darling! I will save you from these vultures!\" A young boy from the first year shouted while pointing at a group of students.\n\"But my lord! You hated me until now…why come to save me now?!\" Another student, a guy, while pretending to be a girl, asked the first one.\nThe first boy's eyes sparkled as, in a dramatic tone, he said, \"I realized my love last night and decided to adhere to you. After all, this useless son of the family needs a powerful woman who can protect him, right~\" Saying so, the guy and the whole group turned their eyes toward Austin.\nValerie's expression darkened, her steps coming to a halt and her aura making the common hall grow dark.\nThe instructors standing at the entrance instantly turned their heads toward the source of the disturbance.\nThe boy who was imitating Austin narrowed his eyes as a cold sweat trailed down his back, but he refused to back off.\nBefore Valerie could have moved toward them and would have done something that surely would have granted her an explosion letter, Austin held her arm.\n\"It's okay, Val. Let them be.\" Austin knew the consequences of any action being taken here. Generally, no instructors remain around Common Hall around this period ... which explains that Morkel has sent them here under the 'presumption' that something might happen.\nAnd the fact that Austin took Valerie's side during the trials must be revealed by him to these students, as well.\nIf Valerie or Austin reacted violently, they would land in their trap.\nValerie's aura slowly subdued, as Austin waved at the instructors before telling them, \"It's all good now.\"\nThe two men glanced at each other before they decided to back off.\nValerie looked at her Lord before asking, \"Just a moment. Please.\"\nAustin trusted her judgment and released her arm.\nValerie turned towards the group and started walking. The instructors tensed up, however, since she wasn't releasing her aura, they didn't stop her.\nShe wasn't running, nor was she yelling. She moved slowly, deliberately, her every step radiating menace. The light in the hall seemed colder, dimmer, as though her very presence was leeching the warmth from the air.\nMost of the boys from the group have backed off except for the two who dare mock her Lord.\nValerie came to a pause before them and asked,\n\"You are Davin Longwock, son of Viscount Orion Longwock, and you….Brendon Notreheim, son of Baron Flitwick Notreheim.\"\nThe boy, Davin, narrowed his eyes, \"Yeah, so what?\"\nValerie ignored his words and continued, \"Section three first year, fourth bench. Section four first year, seventh bench. You both were once charged with sexually assaulting a first-year classmate during the orientation. But because of your father's support, the case was dismissed.\"\nHearing that, Brendon instantly clutched Davin's shirt in apprehension while Davin's expression also faltered.\n\"W-What are you trying to imply here?\"\nA very thin and chilly smile extended her lips, as she said, \"Sadly, your misdeeds will cause not only you but your corrupted fathers as well. Just watch your steps while walking at night. Someone might be behind you~\"\nA chill ran down Davin's spine as he yelled at her, \"You can't threaten us!\"\n\"Threat? A threat has a possibility that the person might not do what they claim.\" Her expression turned frosty, eyes devoid of any emotion as the violet-haired added,\n\"But I assure you, I will make your life hell, after what you have done today. Just wait for the big news, my adorable underclassmen~\"\n—-------**----------\nA/N:- Yeah, she is. Congrats, Austin, you have gained the best kind of waifu.",

      "content": "Chapter 10: Chapter 9- Apology\nIt was not like he didn't hear what Valerie said, but Austin purposely chose to not talk about it. Why? Because they deserved to be punished.\nAfter that, no one dared to mock Austin or Valerie; they didn't even glance at them anymore, knowing to what length Valerie could go if things involved Austin.\nIt was not new for Valerie to take action against people who tried belittling her beloved; however, Austin always reprimanded her, saying he didn't need her consideration, and often complained about her to the headmaster as well.\nHe thought Valerie was taking him as a weak person who could not protect his dignity—however, Valerie just naturally couldn't stand to see someone badmouthing her Lord.\nThe previous Alex might be offended to see her threatening the duo but the current him was grinning ear to ear.\n\"You are adorable, Val.\"\nThe cup from her hand nearly slipped hearing that as she asked, \"Umm...wh-why do you say that?\"\n\"Just felt like it. You are adorable, just accept it.\"\nValerie lowered her eyes, her face turning strawberry red as she nodded, \"...okay.\"\nValerie has received compliments in the past; however, everyone said that she was strong and mature for her age. However, this was the first time someone called her cute and she was lucky to receive the compliment from her dearest.\nAustin was having eggs and bread for breakfast; something he usually preferred when he was regular in the sports team. And now that he has reincarnated in the new world, he wants to maintain his health so yeah, return to a healthy routine.\nAs he bit the bread, Austin casually asked, \"Valerie, can you train me after school?\"\nHearing his request, she was flabbergasted and Austin knew the reason behind her reaction.\nIn the past when Austin lost his first official battle, Valerie approached him and asked if he wanted some help in training.\nAustin was already furious, so he shouted at Valerie saying so many mean things that Valerie cried in front of him for the first time.\nAnd the worst part, Austin didn't even feel guilty about it; he said she cried to make him feel bad and nothing more.\nYeah, scumbag.\nExtending his hand, he softly held her hand and told her, \"I know many things happened between us in these months...and what happened last time, saying a simple apology won't do. So give me some time and I will make up for every mistake I have committed.\"\nValerie tenderly smiled, a smile that can make one's morning good, as she said, \"You don't need to go out of your way to do anything....just your presence in my life alone is hefty compensation.\"\n\"///\" Okay, that smile along with that line was enough to make even Austin—who was confident in his tolerance against charm—blush.\nHowever, he didn't steal his gaze and softly nodded, \"So you don't need-\"\n\"Austin.\" Their conversation was interrupted by a familiar pink head.\nAustin, with an annoyed sigh seeping through his lips, turned towards the girl, \"Yes, Rhea?\" He doesn't want anything or anyone to disturb his time with Valerie.\nIt wasn't like Rhea couldn't read the room; however, there was something that kept gnawing her, which ushered the girl to finally approach him.\n\"Can we talk? Just for a minute?\" She pleaded.\nAustin turned his eyes toward her with a clear intention to deny her request...until his eyes landed on a certain individual who undoubtedly listened to their conversation.\nAfter a pause, he nodded, \"Okay, but just one minute.\" He got up from the seat and kissed Valerie's forehead,\n\"I will be back.\"\nValerie's growing stress was dissipated by that sudden kiss as she covered her face and felt the heat that suddenly enveloped her face.\nAustin followed Rhea to the entrance of the common hall while making sure that many students watched them walking together. He even glanced at the instructors, and fortunately, they also saw them together.\n'Nice~'\nFinally, Rhea came to a halt and turned to look at Austin.\nAfter taking a long breath, the pink-haired teenager finally uttered, \"Austin...I am sorry. I didn't know that Valerie adored that dress so much and I should have controlled my temper back then, considering Valerie isn't aware of my family situation.\"\nAustin raised his brows; it would be a lie to say he was surprised.\nRhea was the protagonist with a golden heart. Naturally, she would feel guilty even for the one who nearly killed her and apologize for her mistake.\nAustin asked in a confused tone, \"Why are you telling me this? Shouldn't you apologize to Valerie instead?\"\nAn awkward smile extended Rhea's lips as she said, \"I...feel quite uncomfortable in her presence...you can say she gives me the vibe of a strict mother who can reprimand me because of the slightest of mistakes.\"\nAustin couldn't stop himself from laughing at the remark.\nIt is true that Valerie possesses a very stern personality, and she doesn't hesitate to make others realize their mistakes. Not only Rhea and some other students but even some Professors are scared of Valerie—given she has spotted mistakes in their teachings in the past.\nSo it wasn't surprising that Rhea was scared of talking to Valerie.\nAustin soon nodded, before assuring her, \"Okay, I will relay your words to her. And for what Valerie did, I would like to extend an apology for that as well.\"\nRhea shook her head with a smile, \"In a way she helped me.... helped me in realizing how far I have to go.\"\nTheir conversation concluded not so long after and Austin returned to his table.\nValerie hasn't touched the food ever since he walked away. Everything looked in its place....except for the fork he was eating with.\n\"Did you change the fork?\" Last he remembered, there were marks of egg white and yolk on it. But now it was shining as new.\nHearing that, just for a moment, Valerie flinched, but Austin was occupied with the strawberry milk, so he didn't notice that.\n\"A-Ah...it fell to the ground, so I brought a new one,\" Valerie explained, and Austin didn't ask about it anymore.\nAs he resumed eating he told her, \"Rhea said she was sorry for what she did to your gown.\"\nValerie's expression sobered up hearing that as she nodded and picked up her cup.\nAustin sensed the change of temperament, as he asked, \"You don't like when I talk to Rhea, right?\"\nValerie instantly shook her head in denial with her eyes widened....however, under her Lord's evaluating gaze she wasn't able to lie for long.\n\"A...little.\"\nAustin chuckled before assuring her, \"Then I won't talk to her...at least alone that is. After all, I must listen to my future wife's demands, right?\"\nThe rest of the breakfast elapsed without Valerie raising her feverish red face even once.\n-----------**----------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 11: Chapter 10- Training(1)\nEl Hener Parkinson—the second son of King Zurkus El Hener.\nParkinson belongs to the neighboring nation and is someone who came here as an exchange student for just a month. However, in that single month, he became infatuated with a certain girl.\nThe way she talked to him without showing prejudice or believing any of those rumors that suggested his father was involved in Dark magic… just touched his heart.\nShe cared about him. She asked him regularly if he had lunch or if he needed any help in integrating himself with the classes. She was there when everyone looked at him with suspicion and contempt.\nAnd that was enough for the Prince to fall for Rhea.\nUnder normal circumstances, Austin would have let Parkinson and the other two continue their love life as usual. He had nothing to do with them. Although Rudolph was his friend, Austin had no interest nor right to interfere with whom Rudolph hung out with.\nHowever, if Austin remains nonchalant about Parkinson then not only Valerie—who was Parkinson's primary target—but now Austin as well, would get targeted.\nCanonically, after Valerie returns from her three-month-long suspension, it was Parkinson who framed her in a severe case, leaving no option for the Headmaster other than to expel the girl.\nParkinson could go to some extreme lengths to protect Rhea and punish those who harm her.\nAnd at the moment, Austin and Valerie are his targets. So before Parkinson does anything Austin devised a plan.\nHowever, before he initiates that, he needs something from a certain someone.\nLoyalty.\n\"Young master?\" There was evident shock on Sebastian's face when he heard the command of his young master.\nAustin, while calmly sipping on the tea Sebastian brewed, said, \"Yes, Sebas. I want you to return to the Capital. I no longer require your services.\"\nAustin plainly stated. After all that he was about to do, he couldn't let his father or anyone else know about it.\nSebastian wasn't able to answer immediately, allowing Austin to add,\n\"I remember my elder brother invited you the previous year to stop working for me and help him in the management. I think your skills are much needed there, Sebas.\"\n\"Young master, if I have done something to anger you, please let me know.\"\nFrom his words, it was certain that the grey-haired man was devoted to serving Austin.\nSebastian has been serving the family for the past twenty-five years, and Austin has been in his care ever since he turned three.\nSo in a way, Austin was like a son to him. And the fondness Sebastian carried was getting exploited here by the blond Prince.\nHeaving a sigh, Austin said, \"You did nothing wrong Sebastian. Rather, I would say that even if I search the whole world, I don't think I can find a responsible and hardworking butler like you. I never even regarded you as a servant but my guardian, Sebas.\"\nThe older one looked older than his age as he softly asked, \"Then…what is the reason, my lord?\"\nAustin finally revealed it, \"It's because I no longer want my father to know about me.\"\nSebastian was taken aback by that reason, and before he could process what his young master said, Austin pressed,\n\"I know you report to him about me. You might have as well surrounded me with surveillance. And after today, I don't want anyone to know what I do.\"\nSebastian now understood what his young master was displeased about.\nIt was not surprising that his young master was aware of his regular reporting to the king.\n…but it's another matter that the Majesty doesn't pay much attention to those letters.\nSebastian knelt before Austin and asked, \"What do you want, young master.\"\nAustin took out a parchment which was glowing with a faint black hue. It was a contract—an Oblivion Accord.\nIt is a type of contract in which if the other party breaches the conditions, then they would forget everything about the contract and everything that happened after the contract was signed.\n\"Sign this, Sebas. From now on, you'll be informing my father what I let you do. If you agree then you can continue to serve me. If not…then I can manage things on my own.\"\nIt would be a lie to say that Austin wasn't feeling anything by cornering the old man like this. This guy has helped him, guided him, and suggested him at so many important steps of his life that he was already far too important for him than his parents.\nHowever, to ensure a better and unrestricted future, Austin has to take these steps.\nSebastian took the contract from him and read it once.\nAustin watched in anticipation; truth be told, he didn't want Sebastian to leave since if he stayed, he would be extremely helpful in what Austin planned to do.\nAnd as he thought(hoped), Sebastian bit his thumb and drew a few droplets of blood on the parchment.\nThe contract was accepted and signed so it glowed and disintegrated.\nAustin smiled, and after getting up, he offered his hand to the older one, \"Thank you, Sebastian. I know I can trust you.\"\nSebastian heaved a sigh; somehow, he could sense that he had landed in the trap that his young master had set for him.\nAustin soon approached the door, urging Sebastian to ask, \"Are you going to your chamber, my lord?\"\nAustin smiled before shaking his head, \"I got a meeting with my fiancée.\"\n—------**-------\nIt took only twenty minutes for Valerie to return to her room, take a quick bath, and change into more comfortable clothes before returning to the training ground.\nHer Lord has asked her to help him train and she desires to be there before time.\nNot long after(an hour), Austin appeared on the training ground with a soft smile and asked, \"Did I make you wait?\"\nValerie slowly shook her head, \"I just arrived.\"\nAustin nodded, before he asked, \"So how should we begin?\"\nValerie's lips turned into a smile that sent a shiver down his spine as she uttered,\n\"Before we start, I need to know how much my lord has progressed.\" She stepped back and asked him,\n\"Please go ahead and try to kill me, Austin.\"\n\"...\"\n—-------**--------\nA/N:- She flips so fast on a normal day.

      "content": "Chapter 12: Chapter 11- Training(2)\nStanding in the middle of the training ground, Austin faced his fiancée, who was currently performing the role of a trainer.\nHolding his daggers, he drew a sharp breath.\nSince using Soul Shards in regular training is not allowed, Austin brought his personal training dagger which surely was sharp enough to cut.\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Austin asked, for the final time.\nValerie calmly nodded and remained nonchalant about this little spar.\n'So be it…'\nAustin lunged forward, dagger flashing in his grip as he aimed for Valarie's side. His movements were swift and precise—each step fueled by his training and knowledge of close combat. Yet, Valarie was faster.\nWith a fluid motion, she sidestepped his thrust, her body weaving just out of reach. Austin pivoted instantly, slashing upward in a seamless follow-up, but Valarie tilted her head back, letting the blade slice through the air inches from her face.\nAustin didn't let up. He stepped in close, feinting low before driving the dagger toward her chest in a sharp thrust. Valarie's hand shot up, catching his wrist mid-motion. With a sharp twist, she forced his arm to the side, but he was already spinning, using the momentum to bring the blade slashing toward her ribs.\nValarie leaned back, the blade slicing harmlessly past her, then stepped into his guard. Her hand shot forward, fingers closing around his forearm like a vice, halting his next attack before it even began.\n\"You're predictable,\" she said, her tone calm, almost teasing.\nFrustrated, Austin tightened his grip and shifted tactics. Feinting a low stab, he quickly redirected the blade toward her shoulder. Valarie's hand shot out, palm open, and redirected his wrist with a sharp push, forcing him off balance.\nBefore he could recover, she closed the distance, her footwork impeccable, and tapped his wrist lightly, disarming him with effortless precision.\nHis dagger clattered to the ground, but Austin wasn't done. He lashed out with his fists, launching a quick jab aimed at her chest. Valarie parried with her forearm, redirecting the force harmlessly to the side.\nShe stepped closer, her movements smooth and controlled, and drove her knee upward—not to strike but to stop his next punch mid-swing by trapping his arm against her thigh.\n\"Be angrier, my lord.\" She sadistically whispered.\nGrowling, Austin twisted free, grabbed his dagger, and swung in a wide arc. Valarie leaned back, her torso bending like a reed in the wind, and then she spun, closing the gap faster than he could react. Her fingers lightly tapped his forehead, a mock strike that caused him to fall back—however, just in time, Austin held her collar and pulled her down with him.\n**THUD**\nBoth of them fell to the ground, their faces inches away as Austin held her by her shoulders and looked into her surprised eyes.\nAustin's breathing was ragged as he stared at the girl who completely overwhelmed him even without using an ounce of magic and a weapon.\nIn a barely audible tone, Valerie asked, \"Are you angry, my lord?\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"Why… haa…why would I be? You just showed me where I stand, and made me realize how far I have to go.\"\nIn the past, his answer might have been different, given the previous owner regarded everything as infuriating when it concerned Valerie.\nValerie knelt between his legs and asked shyly, \"Are you hurt?\"\nAustin softly smiled and whispered, \"If you are going to be my nurse, then yes, my whole body is aching.\"\nValerie's lips stretched in a shy smile as she lowered her head, letting her violet hair fall like curtains and hiding her face.\nThey soon got up, and Austin realized that, indeed, there was aching in his waist, but a good night's sleep would take for the pain to vanish.\nTheir training went on for another ten or so minutes before Austin raised his hands in defeat, saying his current self couldn't touch her.\nValerie went to bring water and a towel for him as Austin sat on the nearby bench.\nOnce she returned, Austin took a few mouthfuls of water.\nOnce he was done, he asked her, \"So? What do I need to work on? And please, be as blunt as you can.\"\nValerie remained silent for a moment, hesitating, but then she decided it would be unfair to tell him the half-truth, \"My lord, your movements and techniques are top-notch…what you lack are speed and precision. You were moving too slowly earlier for a close-combat warrior. First, we need to work on that.\"\nAustin nodded, \"So stamina and speed training along with aiming and combat training. Hmm…it's like I need to start from zero.\"\nValerie panicked, seeing her lord's shoulder slumping as she hurriedly added, \"Ahh..but on the bright side, you realize your mistakes early, and there are still three months for the tournament. If you prepare accordingly then you surely can aim for a spot.\"\nAustin smiled in defeat as he said, \"You still believe I can participate in that tournament where the top five students from the academy are chosen?\"\nValerie confidently nodded, \"I have seen my lord from close, and I can say confidently that no one works as hard as you when it comes to self-improvement.\"\nShe wasn't speaking those words out of her fondness towards Austin. The blond Prince indeed has developed his skills and Soul Shard to qualify for this academy.\nIf Austin had worked as hard as a normal person then he would have gone to a normal knight academy and would have reached the rank of a soldier at best.\nSo yes, Austin had the potential and dedication to become an exceptional warrior.\nAustin smiled fondly at her, and while softly holding her hand, he said, \"If you are with me, then surely I will participate and even win the tournament.\"\nIt might sound filmy but if the best student is helping him, then Austin believed that he might grow exponentially in weeks.\nValerie held his hand back, albeit hesitantly, as she uttered, \"I have always been, and always will be, with my lord.\"\n—-------**--------\nA/N:- Having a girl like Valerie is blessing.",

The exemplary student of the academy who always gets the perfect score and someone who is respected by even the Headmaster.\nWow…such an admirable girl.\nHowever, beyond those achievements, what is she? A rotten slut who targets those who are weaker than her and torments them.\nValerie is someone I hate with passion. She has tormented Rhea more than once, calling her undisciplined and whatnot. While she does what? Flaunt her achievement and that sickening body here and there to enchant others and that pathetic excuse of a fiancé.\nThat harlot is going to die by my hand, and that is something I have decided that very day when she called Rhea, an orphan.\nRhea isn't an orphan. I am here for her! I can be everything she desires in her life! And no one. Not a single person has the right to call her an orphan.\nSo yes, Valerie has to die. The most gruesome and nastiest death known to mankind.\nHaah, it might become a little hectic since she is a Duke's daughter, but well, there is no helping it. I will at least leave her body behind for her relatives to celebrate a funeral.\nAnd while doing so, I think I might as well get rid of that loser prince.\nAustin…haha! That disgraceful child of the royal family who got ignored by everyone and was made fun of even by servants back home.\nOne day, when he was emotional, he was blurting that all out in front of me and Rhea…\nPfft-a loser that awakened a stick as his Soul Shard. I say he should have stabbed his eye or maybe throat and killed himself right there rather than dragging his worthless life.\nA stick-pfft!\nI might have tolerated him since Rhea liked him\nas a friend.\nHowever, my thinking has changed now.\nHe dared to take that bitch's side…he humiliated Rhea in front of everyone….making her feel guilty…she was sad…she cried….pfft-ahahahaha…she cried, y'know. And for whom? That…pfft-\nNah, Austin dies. He has to. Until I see him around, I will be reminded of that day when my dearest cried and felt guilty for something she shouldn't have. Rather, I would have been happy if she had 'accidentally' stabbed Valerie.\nBut well, thanks to that day, I now know whom I have to get rid of this time. And just like the previous three times, I know I won't get caught this time as well.\nJust wait for me~\n—-------**---------\n[Third Person POV:]\nAustin returned to his room after his chat with Valerie.\nHe took a bath and changed into more comfortable clothes.\nSebastian informed him that there was still some work left, which Austin needed to finish before the weekends.\nAustin had to return to the capital as well, so there was very little time remaining.\n'Hmm…let's see…' When he was with Valerie he received one notification from the system.\n[Due to the host's recent action, two new progress meters have appeared that will directly affect the overall progress.]\n[Combat: 12/100]\n[Next reward at 20]\n[Romance: 21/100]\n[Ding!]\n[You have been rewarded for crossing the first threshold in Romance!]\n[Next reward at 40]\n[Overall: 18.5/100]\n[Next reward at 20]\n…\nAustin raised his brows and mentally tapped on the reward tab.\n[Ding!]\n[Heart felt chocolates: 1 box]\n[Things whispered to every chocolate piece would be heard by the one who eats them.]\nAustin smiled seeing the box in his hand.\nThis was brilliant and quite romantic, something that would have easily become quite popular back on Earth.\n'Hmm…let's see…' He sat at the edge of the bed and picked the first one…and before he knew it, he was already done with the twentieth one.\nLooking at each one of them marked with a hollow circle, Austin chuckled,\n'Guess I am natural at this…'\nDeciding to give this box to Valerie later, he went to his office first to finish the work.\n….\n*Click*\nAustin was provided a separate office in the dorms since, as a Prince, he had to fulfill some duties as well.\nThe office wasn't too big, nor were any decorative items that could signify that royalty works here.\nJust a working table, three shelves for books and documents, and a single couch nearby on which Sebastian was previously sat.\n\"Can I get some tea, Sebas?\"\n\"Right away, sir.\" Sebastian went to prepare the beverage.\nAustin sat on his usual seat and looked at his pending work.\nAlthough Austin was quite intelligent and well-versed in management, he was given work related to sorting out names according to their wages and some other miscellaneous stuff.\nWhy? Because he was still perceived as an immature child.\n\"*Scoff*\"\nSeeing his young master scoffing while looking at the documents, Sebastian felt a little sad,\n\"Young master…I talked to Your Majesty, and he said you would be given the duty to arrange the security personnel in the near future.\"\n\"Security…for whom? Cattles?\" Austin asked, his tone bleeding with mockery. And this mockery was aimed at no one but himself.\nWell, Austin didn't feel much about this whole partial behavior but still wasting his time over sorting names was frustrating.\nHe was aware of who was behind this. The being who doesn't want Austin to get involved with the management or any important thing, and also to annoy Austin so when he returns home, he can make a joke of himself.\nAustin heaved a sigh and silently began to finish the remaining lists one after another. However, now he didn't remain so elegant with his handwriting nor paid much attention. He was well aware that no one was gonna give a single F about these lists so why should he take it seriously?\nIt took three hours and two cups of tea before Austin was done with his work.\n*CRACK*\nGoing on his toes, and his fingers interlaced, Austin stretched his body and heard the satisfying popping sound.\n\"Haah…\" Exhaling a satisfied breath, he heard the butler softly chiding,\n\"It's inappropriate to do that, sir.\"\nAustin shrugged, \"Well, that's the most human thing.\"\nSebastian raised his brows, \"Cracking bones?\"\nAustin smilingly shook his head, \"No, being inappropriate.\"\n—------**-------\nA/N:- Should I increase the word count?

Can I take one?\"\nShe extended her hand but Austin instantly retracted the box and told her, \"It's a gift for Val.\" He smilingly said.\nRhea's eyes widened slowly, \"Oh…I am so sorry. You know how much I love sweet things. Anyways, I am very happy to see you two getting along.\"\nAustin glanced behind her before he smiled again and this time, in a warmer tone, he said, \"Well it's all because of you that I was able to realize my feelings for her.\"\nThey exchanged a few more words before Austin took his leave.\nAlthough he promised Valerie that he wouldn't talk to this girl…he had to.\n'Haah, I will apologize to her.'\nReaching the dining hall, he looked around.\nEveryone has their friends and lovers surrounding them. And the only person who sat in the corner, all alone and silent was the girl he was searching for.\nSometimes Austin felt bad for Valerie that no one was willing to talk to her….and until recently he also used to ignore her.\nHow lonely she must have felt to see the man she loves fawning over another woman and ignoring her.\n…Austin used to even make fun of the fact that no one wanted to eat with Valerie.\nWith those thoughts, when Austin reached her, he rested the chocolate box on the table, and after sitting beside her, he hugged the girl.\n\"M-M-My lord…?\" Valerie was shocked beyond belief as she felt herself being surrounded by a warmth that she dearly missed. However, this was too sudden!\nThe cold expression she previously wore melted completely as Austin embraced her close to him, feeling the guilt from his heart slowly receding, but it was still not enough.\n\"I have hurt you a lot, no?\"\nValerie didn't know what had happened so suddenly, but hearing his voice, she knew he was thinking about their past.\nDespite the embarrassment and shock, she rested her hands on his back and said,\n\"It's all okay now, Austin. I have already forgiven you.\"\nAustin slowly parted away from her and told her, \"If you forgive me so easily, then I will get the freedom to make more mistakes and just say a simple apology.\"\nValerie tilted her head adorably and asked, \"Then…what should I do?\"\nAustin raised his brows mischievously before telling her, \"Be angrier, sweetheart.\"\nValerie blushed hearing that, remembering she said something similar during the training.\nShe clutched his sleeve and told him, \"I-It wasn't me…just my split personality….trust me, my lord.\"\nAustin chuckled. The way her personality switches, he might have believed her lie.\n\"Here, \"Offering her the box he said, \"For you. There is a surprise in it.\"\nValerie curiously opened the box and found several heart-shaped chocolates resting inside.\n\"Go on, try one.\"\nValerie took the first one from the bottom left, and a bit on it, and instantly her eyes widened.\nShe heard his voice yet he wasn't speaking. His whisper reached her ears, almost like he was just right beside her.\nA warm blush adorned her cheeks as she couldn't stop herself from smiling.\nA smile that made Austin sigh in admiration. After a long day at work, this smile alone can vanish his weariness.\nValerie then closed the box and softly said, \"I will have one every day.\"\n\"I expected much,\" Austin said with a smile before he asked, \"Did you have dinner?\"\nValerie nodded, \"I was just about to finish.\"\nAustin saw there were a few pieces of meat left—accurately chopped into cubes.\nHe picked her fork and was about to eat one, when suddenly Valerie said, \"Ah…I used that…one.\"\nAustin smiled at her, \"Then the steak might taste a little sweet, I suppose?\"\nValerie's face was a sight to gaze at after he said that.\nThe blush was so profound that she seemed on the verge of fainting.\nAnd it wasn't only Austin but many others around them who were looking at Valerie with a surprised look.\n\"Is she the same strict girl who can even scold a Professor for their tardiness?\" One of them asked.\n\"Don't know man…this version is completely different from what we see during classes…\"\nWhispers and murmurs were erupting from every corner since Valerie was not only the top student but a member of the student council. A disciplinary in charge, no less. And for her to behave so…maiden-ly was quite shocking.\nNot so long after, they left the common hall and were headed towards the girl's dormitory.\nThey were walking slowly side by side, enjoying each others' company and the peaceful atmosphere.\nWhile walking Austin suddenly remembered something and told her, \"In six days, I will be leaving for the Capital…do you want to come with me?\"\nNaturally, Valerie was also invited to the party and she always goes there as the daughter of the Duke and Austin's fiancée.\nLast year, they went separately, but not this year.\n\"I…would love to.\" Valerie did not have much expectations with the celebration but the journey back home surely would be sweet.\n\"And…have you planned on what you will give me on my birthday?\"\nValerie has actually thought of gifting him a special dagger…however, she asked,\n\"Is there something my lord desires from me?\"\nAustin smiled upon hearing that and looked at Valerie with a tender expression.\nThey slowly came to a pause, and just as she thought he would tell her, Austin shook his head, \"Not now, I will ask you that day.\"\nInching closer to her, he planted a soft kiss on her forehead and said, \"Now go back and sleep. We have to wake up early tomorrow.\"\nValerie nodded with a smile never leaving her face before she turned around and began walking away.\nAustin didn't walk away until he saw her room's lights turned on before he turned around and made his way back to the dormitory.\n'Haah~I am sorry Val, but I can only ask for forgiveness as a gift, for what I am going to do….'\n—-------**--------\nA/N:- Okay, I love writing their interaction",

      "content": "Chapter 15: Chapter 14- Manipulation\n\"Are you sure, master?\" There was a frown on Sebastian's face when he asked that.\nAustin was changing his clothes and getting ready for school.\nWithout looking at the man, he said, \"Yes, Sebas. I can not be any more sure about this.\"\nSebastian thought for a moment before asking, \"Do you have any proof that the student is actually planning something against you?\"\nAustin paused and then turned toward Sebastian.\nWith utter seriousness in his eyes, he told him, \"If I am proven wrong, Sebas, then I will confess my deeds and leave this academy as a punishment.\"\nSebastian has nothing more to say. If his young master was absolute about something then it must be the case.\nAustin slid his feet inside his shoes, and while he tied his laces, he told the older one, \"In fifteen minutes, send Rudolph to my office.\"\n\"As you command, my lord.\"\n….\nAustin left his room and headed towards his office.\nHe doesn't have much work, and the classes start in two hours, so why is he going to his office rather than sharing the breakfast table with his fiancée?\nWell, there was a definite reason.\nThe reason why Austin wanted Sebastian's loyalty to himself was because of this.\nHe needs to get rid of Parkinson before the psycho ends up hurting Valerie.\nAfter ten or so minutes, someone knocked on the office door before Austin said,\n\"Come in.\" From the other side, the tall and broad black-haired man walked in.\n\"You called me?\" Rudolph Sabretooth is the son of the Knight Commander and someone who has known Austin since the age of ten.\nHe is a good friend and someone who knows Austin's situation back home.\nThey used to spar in the past, but Rudolph easily became far too strong for Austin to match him in a battle.\nGesturing toward the couch, Austin said, \"Sit.\"\nRudolph remained standing and said, \"Just tell me quickly, I have someone to meet.\"\nAustin smiled, \"Must be Rhea. You finally got a worthy opponent to spar against.\"\nRudolph smirked, \"Yup~she is the best.\"\nAustin warmly smiled, \"It fills my heart with joy to see that finally, you got yourself a real friend here. Back then, everyone used to ignore you but Rhea…she is different.\"\nThe smile on Rudolph's face extended; happy to hear someone praising the woman he adores.\n\"Yes, that she is. The perfect kind of woman which anyone could desire.\"\nFor a moment, Austin's face turned into a scowl but he quickly improved his expression and said, \"You must be told to return to the Capital, right?\"\nRudolph's expression turned sour, \"Yeah…\" He was told by his father to return and join the celebration. However, he didn't want to go and leave Rhea here with Parkinson and Morkel.\nAustin leaned forward and suggested, \"How about I make up some excuse in your stead and explain things to your father?\"\nRudolph's eyes brightened, \"Really? You will do that?\"\n\"Of course, I can for my friend. Just don't send him any letter for the time being, okay?\"\n\"If you can get me permission to stay back then anything for you!\" The evident happiness on his face showed how much he was attached to Rhea and that even a few days of separation was too much for him.\nRudolph was then about to take his leave with a huge smile on his face when suddenly, Austin said,\n\"Uh-can you send Parkinson to the office?\"\n\"Sure, buddy!\" Rudolph turned around and left soon after.\nAustin's smile immediately disappeared as he heaved a sigh and drank a few mouthfuls of water.\n[Ding!]\n[A new index has appeared!]\n[Trickery: 5/100]\n[Next reward at 10]\n…\nNow that puts a genuine smile on his face.\n*Knock*\nHowever, soon he regained his composure and after wearing his reading glasses he said,\n\"Come in.\" Austin began to pretend that he was working as he commanded.\nFrom the other side, the long green-haired teenager walked in.\nThe lanky 5'10 looked displeased even though nothing Austin had spoken until now. His sharp grey eyes bore on Austin as he said,\n\"What do you want?\" He was just about to go and have breakfast with Rhea when suddenly the asswipe called him.\nAustin didn't remove his eyes from the document before he sternly spoke, \"I have invited you here to warn you.\"\nParkinson frowned, a scowl appearing on his face, \"Warn? About what?\"\nAustin slowly raised his eyes from the document and looked at him.\nWith his upturned gaze fixed on the guy he said,\n\"You have been wandering around the girl's dorm a lot. I saw you last night.\"\nParkinson's eyes widened in agitation. His fist clenched, \"You….!!!\"\n\"I am warning you, Parkinson, stop stalking Rhea or I will-\"\n\"Or you will what?! Complain to the headmaster or your Papa?! Who are you gonna tell, you asshole! I knew it! You were just pretending to be all chummy with Valerie! You are still after my Rhea!\"\nHis aura flared; the table and the shelves began to shake under his magical presence. The blood lust that the boy contained within was making it a bit stuffy inside the office.\nAustin retained his calm, even though he knew with his current strength he couldn't defeat the guy.\nHowever, he didn't show even a bit of apprehension and after redirecting his gaze back to the papers, he said,\n\"Think whatever you want. Just stop before-\"\n\"To hell with your warning, asshole!\" Parkinson suddenly opened the door, startling the ones passing by.\n\"Don't ever call me here or I am so gonna kill you!\"\n*SLAM*\nSlamming the door, Parkinson walked away while seething.\nOnce the door was closed, a smirk extended his lips.\n\"Perfect….these guys are so easy to manipulate…\"\nAustin never saw anyone out of the girl's dormitory given Parkinson excels in assassination skills. However, he had the knowledge of the game so he used it here.\n[Ding!]\n[The host has reached the first threshold in Trickery!]\n[Trickery: 10/100]\nAustin let out a small chuckle as he leaned back in his seat, and rested his feet on the table,\n\"Now Parkinson, dance for me.\"\n—--------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 16: Chapter 15- Punish me~\n*CLANG*\nHearing Parkinson slamming the tray on the table, Rhea was startled as she asked, \"What happened? Why do you look displeased?\"\nHearing her voice, it was like all his agitation melted away as Parkinson slowly sat down and shook his head, \"Just some noisy pest. Don't worry about that.\"\nIf there was something good about this morning, then it was the fact that Rhea was currently alone, and they could have their time at the breakfast table.\nHowever, just as Parkinson was about to ask if she wanted to taste the pastry he brought, she suddenly got up.\n\"Where are you going?\" Her food was still half finished, which meant she was in a rush.\nRhea apologetically told him, \"I have to submit the class report to the teacher before homeroom. Thankfully, Austin is helping me out this time.\"\nParkinson's eyes widened, \"Wait! Are you taking his help? Why?\" You could have asked me—he held from uttering the last part, fearing he might let out his possessiveness appear in his voice.\nRhea shrugged, \"His management skills and his handwriting are the best in the class, that's why. Okay then.\"\nSeeing Rhea walking away, the glass in Parkinson's hand began to crack, and not so long after, the glass broke into small fragments as Parkinson stared at the entrance of the common hall with his eyes turning blood red.\n\"Austin...Austin…..Austin…..that fucker….why can't he just….\" He was sheathing right now, and whoever saw him decided to take a detour to stay away from the man.\nIf Morkel had been around, then he surely would have somehow calmed him down. However, he was sent to the nearby town for some reason.\nEvery second of his life is becoming harder for Parkinson to tolerate that piece of trash named Austin.\nHis anger seemed now more directed at the Prince rather than Valerie.\n'I am gonna kill him…I cannot….no longer….hahahahah!!' Everyone watched in horror as Parkinson began to laugh hysterically.\n—------**--------\nInside the classroom, Rhea could be seen sitting in the front seat, doing her work.\nShe handed half of the list to Austin, and she would have chosen to sit beside him for efficient work. However, when she saw the purple-haired lady sitting in the back, Rhea chose to sit in the front.\nAustin, meanwhile, was writing the report of every student about their attendance in class and during practical lessons, while Valerie handed him the profile according to the name.\nSeeing her Lord's hand moving so elegantly on the paper, drawing every letter like an artist creating art, she couldn't help but sigh in admiration.\nHis fingers are well shaped and his nails always remain finely trimmed. In all her life, she has never met a man who takes care of his appearance so well.\n\"Staring at me so hard, don't tell me you fell for me.\" Hearing his voice she immediately moved her gaze away, realizing how she must be making him uncomfortable.\nAustin smiled at her as he rested his cheek in his hand, and looked at the girl, \"Tell me, Val, aren't you already tired of looking at the same face so many times?\"\nHer embarrassment soon subdued as she looked at her Lord and slowly shook her head,\n\"Getting tired while looking at you is simply not possible, my lord. I can sit here and watch you for days.\"\nAustin chuckled—really, when she is honest, she is dangerous for his heart.\nTilting his head a little, he asked, \"I have noticed you often call me 'Lord' and hesitate to call me by my name. Why is that?\"\nAlthough there is a custom of ladies of royal houses to address their husband as 'Lord,' Valerie isn't married to him, and Austin would never force her to stick to the traditions.\nHowever ..it's a fact that he feels his heart fluttering whenever she softly calls him 'My lord'.\nValerie was shy about confessing it, but as he asked previously, she didn't want to hide things and let it become a source of misunderstanding between them.\n\"It's the…admiration I have for you that makes me feel a little reluctant to call you by your name.\"\nAustin raised his brows before drawing closer to her and whispering, \"Then how about trying something else? Dear or Honey for example?\"\nValerie's eyes slowly widened, her cheeks reminiscent of the setting sun as she lowered her eyes and parted her lips,\n\"....t-that….I-I need…s-some…time to prepare….\"\nAustin happily chuckled, as he wrapped his arm around her shoulder and hugged the shy fluff ball of cuteness.\n\"Valerie, oh Valerie. How adorable can you be?\"\nThrough morning flirting, they finally finished working on the reports and Austin gave it to Rhea, who seemed to be blushing slightly when she received the papers.\n\"Everything alright?\" Austin asked, thinking that she might have a fever.\nHowever, her response made her realize, \"You know I am a superhuman too, right…?\"\n\"I guess yeah, that's why you are in this academy?\" He plainly stated.\nThe pink head grumbled before taking the papers from him and saying, \"Forget it…you are not someone I can predict anymore.\"\nAustin shrugged as he turned around and headed back to his seat.\nSeeing Valerie standing near the desk, he asked, \"Can't you just sit beside me?\" Although there were rules that one had to sit on the seat assigned to them at the beginning of the semester, Austin really doesn't want to part ways with his fiancée.\nValerie looked troubled. As much as she sticks to rules and regulations most of the time, she also wants to share the seat with her beloved.\nSuddenly she had a thought before she assured him, \"I will talk to the teacher.\"\n\"Hmm? How will you manage?\"\nValerie looked hesitant as she said, \"As the disciplinarian in charge, I have the right to keep a close eye on the problem child.\"\nAustin mischievously smiled, \"So am I now a problem child, eh?\"\n\"N-No…I…don't…\"\nAustin held her hand and pulled her closer. Wrapping his hand around her slender waist he muttered, \"Well, true. For you, I can be quite problematic from time to time. And as a disciplinary officer, I hope you can punish me from time to time.\"\nAfter that, Valerie spent a whole period in a daze.\n—-------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 17: Chapter 16- Out of control(1)\nThe academy focused both on the academic as well as physical growth of the students.\nThose who graduate from the central academy of the nation walk towards a brighter future, and there is a reason for it.\nThe academy ensures to identify and polish the talent of each student while providing a basic knowledge in every field. So, if in the future, the student fails to excel in the field they always had an interest in, they can at least look for another job with the knowledge they received.\nJust like how Austin was more suited for management jobs, someone who has a quality of a leader and a manager. However, he joined the academy with the intention of becoming a well-versed warrior who can continue the legacy of his ancestors.\nAlthough people have already assumed that Austin can never become the next king—given how brilliant the eldest one was—Austin always aimed to become the strongest so he could make his parents regret choosing his elder brother over Austin.\nWell, the current Austin has a different goal in his mind.\nThe Demon King.\nYeah, the same old Demon king also resides in this world. And to defeat that being, Austin has to travel a very long path.\nIn the game, Rhea was able to reach that level where she could use her wits and plot armor to defeat the King. However, if talking about raw power and experience, the Demon King far dominated the Protagonist.\nThe Demon King has four Generals—The Parasite Chief, the Succubus Queen, the Orc Lord, and the Elven General.\nAfter defeating one of the four generals, Valerie later becomes the Parasite Chief so she can take revenge on Rhea and get her beloved back.\nRhea failed to defeat the Parasite Chief in their first exchange, so she, along with her harem members, made up a plan.\nAustin was used to lure Valerie into a trap where Rhea stabs her from behind. However, since the Parasite Chief had two hearts, Austin stabs the other one.\nAnd the most saddening part…when Austin raises his weapon against Valerie she doesn't even try to dodge. With a smile, she embraced whatever her beloved had to offer.\nHe still remembers the last word she said before life faded from her eyes,\n'I-If I knew… the-that my death can make you happy ....then I would have stabbed myself a long time ago…to see that smile…'\nThat line was etched in his memories, and it was the reason why Austin always felt so much pity and sadness whenever he faced his fiancée.\n*CLANG*\nFeeling the absence of a dagger from his hand, Austin turned towards Valerie and found her looking back at him worryingly.\n\"Are you hurt? Show me your hand.\" She inched closer to him and looked at his hand.\nThere was a red glaring mark down his index finger, showing that the strike, indeed, was quite difficult for him to withstand.\nValerie inwardly reprimanded herself for getting engrossed in the spar so much that she ended up hurting her Lord.\n\"Valerie, it doesn't hurt.\" Austin assured her, \"I was not paying attention, sorry about that.\" He confessed.\nThey were in the middle of a spar, and Austin got so completely occupied by his thoughts that he never saw that strike and ended up losing his weapon.\nValerie shook her head, \"No, Austin, it was my fault. You were blocking so well that I…anyway, let's go to the medic.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh and didn't say anything after that. However, before they could have turned around to leave, someone called out,\n\"I propose a duel against you, Austin.\"\nThe other students, along with the instructor, turned to look at the teenager who stated that.\nWithout even looking at Austin could tell who this person was.\n\"...Parkinson.\" Austin heaved a sigh, \"Why don't you find someone of your battle style to fight against? I am clearly not in your league.\"\nAustin plainly stated that, making Parkinson smirk. There were other students as well who snickered upon hearing that.\nHowever, it didn't affect the Prince at all. He wasn't ashamed to accept his current self. However, he would regard himself as a failure if he stopped improving.\n\"Don't worry, I will put a handicap on myself and won't use my Soul Shard. Of course, you can.\"\nValerie frowned, \"Austin is injured and can't fight right now.\"\nParkinson smirked, and while ignoring the girl he mocked the blond Prince, \"What happened, Austin? Have you lost your pride and dignity and just decided to hide behind your fiancée? I never thought you would become this pathetic.\"\nRhea, who was not so far away from them, frowned and was about to step forward when suddenly Rudolph held her shoulder and stopped her.\n\"Don't, Rhea. It's a matter between two men and you or I don't have the right to interfere.\"\nRhea was annoyed by such principles; however, until the instructor was here, she decided not to take things into her own hands.\n'Damn it, Park…why are you behaving like a prick all of a sudden?'\nBack in the middle of all this drama, the instructor warned, \"Watch your words, Parkinson.\"\nThe said boy just shrugged, \"I just didn't mind decency while speaking but what I said is true, no? Austin only knows how to hide behind-\"\n\"Okay, stop. I don't like that potty mouth calling out Val's name.\" Austin said as he stepped forward.\nA few people chuckled hearing that while Parkinson snarled, \"So you decided to be a man today?\"\nAustin heaved a weary sigh, \"How much can you yap, Parkinson? Let's just get started man.\"\nParkinson scowled before he went towards the shelf to pick a weapon.\nMeanwhile, Valerie stepped forward and worriedly asked, \"My lord…is this really okay?\"\nAustin fondly smiled at her and said, \"I don't care what the world says, love. Until you have confidence in me, I know I can defeat anyone. Well, not defeat but surely I can push beyond my limits.\"\nValerie's shoulders relaxed upon hearing that.\nVery shyly, she held his hand and said, \"I will be cheering for you.\"\nAustin confidently smiled and told her, \"That's all I need.\"\n—----*-----\nA/N:- Yeah, humiliate him.

      "content": "Chapter 18: Chapter 17- Out of control(2)\nThe gym was silent, save for the sharp clash of blades. Everyone was intently watching the spectacle unfolding before them.\nParkinson moved like a shadow, his wooden sword slicing through the air with a whistle. Austin barely deflected it with his soul-shard, sparks flaring as the weapons collided. Sweat ran down his brow, his feet sliding back from the sheer force of Parkinson's attack.\n\"Too slow, Austin!\" Parkinson taunted, darting in low. The wooden blade struck Austin's thigh with a crack, making him stumble.\nA ripple of murmurs echoed from their classmates, who leaned closer, their eyes wide with awe and anticipation.\nParkinson didn't let up. He spun on his heel, his sword aiming for Austin's ribs. The blow grazed him, drawing a grunt of pain. Parkinson grinned, relentlessly, his strikes blurring together in a flurry of arcs and thrusts. Austin ducked, sidestepped, and blocked, but each movement cost him ground.\n\"He is getting dominated. Parkinson is in the top five of the first year, and Austin...\"\n\"Austin was ranked in the bottom five in the practical assessment.\"\n\"He is too predictable and slow on his feet.\" Comments like these continued to flow toward the arena, where Austin had been getting overwhelmed for the past two minutes.\nValerie was clenching her fist with enough force to turn her knuckles white. Seeing her Lord getting harmed was not something she could ever enjoy. Her heart bled, and her mind was filled with agitation toward Parkinson.\nHowever, she chose to believe in her beloved and silently watched the battle,\n'You can do this...'\n\"What's wrong? Out of tricks already?\" Parkinson sneered, stepping forward with another sweeping strike.\nAustin's mind raced. He wasn't fast enough to match Parkinson's speed, but speed wasn't the only weapon in a fight.\nAs Parkinson's wooden sword came down again, Austin sidestepped sharply, letting the blade skim past him. With a flick of his wrist, one dagger flew from his hand, spinning toward the ground near Parkinson's feet.\nThe clatter of metal drew Parkinson's eyes for a fraction of a second. That was all Austin needed.\nHe surged forward, slamming his shoulder into Parkinson's chest. The impact sent the faster fighter staggering back, his footing wobbly from the distraction. Austin's second dagger flashed, nicking Parkinson's arm with a shallow cut.\n\"Agh!\" Parkinson gritted his teeth; he didn't think Austin would ever let go of Soul Shard, knowing that the idiot would lose his connection with his Shard once it was released from the hold.\n\"Way to go, Austin!\"\nSuddenly, a cheer from the audience erupted, and that made Parkinson's eyes widen.\nHe couldn't believe that no one....but...Rhea cheered for him.\nThe slight distraction was all Austin needed as he shot forward, his fist cocked, and the teenager aimed to hit the boy in the chest.\n**DHAK**\nHowever, something unexpected occurred and Parkinson held his fist right before it could have made contact with its target.\nParkinson's grip tightened around Austin's fist like a vice, his knuckles white with pressure. His eyes, sharp and furious, locked onto Austin's with an intensity that made the room fall silent.\n\"You think you can win this?\" Parkinson hissed, his voice low but filled with menace. He shoved Austin back with a force that sent him stumbling. Without hesitation, Parkinson closed the gap, his wooden sword forgotten on the floor.\nBefore Austin could steady himself, Parkinson's palm slammed into his chest, driving him backward. The impact knocked the wind out of him, and he barely had time to raise his daggers before Parkinson was on him again.\n\"You stole her from me!\" Parkinson roared, his movements faster and more brutal now, fueled by frustration and humiliation.\nA sharp kick caught Austin in the side, sending him crashing to the floor. He rolled quickly, trying to recover, but Parkinson was relentless. A downward strike with his palm connected with Austin's shoulder, pinning him to the ground.\nThe crowd winced as the sound of the impact echoed through the gym. Parkinson's expression was a mix of fury and something darker—a need to reassert his dominance. He grabbed Austin by the collar, lifting him slightly off the floor.\n\"You don't deserve to fight me!\" he spat, glaring furiously at his opponent.\nAustin, being held by the person who went back on his words for not using Aura, chuckled.\nUnder everyone's astonished gazes the Soul Shard of Austin began to levitate as the owner of the daggers remained tightly held by Parkinson.\n\"You don't deserve to live! You are nothing but a piece of trash wh-\"\n\"Parkinson, watch out!\"\nSomeone from the crowd shouted, alerting the green-haired before he spun on his feet and barely caught the dagger by his hand.\n**SHLINK**\nThe momentum of the blade caused his hand to bleed; however, Parkinson fueled his body with enough Aura to withstand the impact.\n\"Such a cheap tri-khuk!\"\nSuddenly a kick was delivered to his ribs, making Parkinson wince. Turning around, Parkinson found his eyes widening.\nIn a blur of motion, Austin's aura flared, a faint glow igniting around his body. His muscles tensed, his form becoming even more solid and powerful.\nThe same person who can barely use his Soul Shard was now utilizing his aura to strengthen his body?!\n\"How is that even possible?!\"\n\"I heard he was getting trained by the best...but this is too sudden!\"\nEven Valerie was amazed since her Lord wasn't able to use his Aura for anything other than utilizing it to summon his Soul Shard.\nAmidst the growing curiosity and tension, Austin threw his shoulder into Parkinson's chest, the impact causing the faster fighter to stagger back, his footing momentarily compromised. Parkinson grunted, trying to regain control, but Austin was already closing the distance, moving with fluidity and precision.\nAustin's foot snapped upward, catching Parkinson in the midsection with a devastating knee strike, the force amplified by his aura. The wind was knocked from Parkinson's lungs, and he doubled over, gasping for air. Before he could react, Austin surged forward, locking his arms around Parkinson's waist in a powerful clinch.\nThe crowd watched in stunned silence as Austin used his aura to strengthen his body, lifting Parkinson off his feet with ease. He slammed Parkinson to the mat with an earth-shaking thud, the crowd wincing at the brutal impact.\n\"What kind of brute fighting style is that?\" Even the instructor was amazed.\nWithout missing a beat, Austin moved like a seasoned fighter. He mounted Parkinson, straddling him with perfect control. His fists rained down in rapid succession, each punch laced with the power of his aura.\nParkinson tried to cover his face, but Austin was relentless. A jab to the jaw, then an elbow to the temple. Each strike pushed Parkinson further into disarray.\nAustin didn't slow down. His fists turned into a blur, the blows landing with brutal efficiency. Each punch caused the blood of his enemy to spurt.\nParkinson's face was slowly changing as Austin continued to charge like a restless bull.\nParkinson's attempts to block and counter were futile against the onslaught.\nAustin had him trapped. With a roar of frustration, Parkinson tried to push Austin off, but Austin was too fast, too strong. He wrapped one hand around Parkinson's neck in a tight chokehold, cutting off his air supply. The green-haired fighter struggled, his hands clawing at Austin's arm, but his movements grew weaker as the pressure increased.\nHowever, before Austin could continue, someone pushed him away from Parkinson—allowing Parkinson to choke out-breath.\nEveryone watched in awe and admiration how Austin shifted the tides of the battle in an instant and completely overwhelmed Parkinson.\nSurely, the green-haired wasn't using his strongest weapon, his Shard, but still, in close combat, Austin showed his dominance.\nStanding at one side with his hands resting on his waist, Austin couldn't help but mutter,\n'Who knew three years of MMA training would turn out to be helpful someday....'\n----------**---------\nA/N:- Now, he is so gonna get out of control.

      "content": "Chapter 19: Chapter 18- I am proud of you\nAustin was taken to the infirmary after the battle since he was gravely injured during the battle.\nNaturally, the same could be said about Parkinson.\nAustin had been in a slight daze since the moment he received a few notifications from the system. And he vaguely remembers whatever happened after that.\nInside the infirmary, the instructor told him to rest there for the time being until the nurse allowed him to return back to the room.\n\"Ou!\" He winced as the nurse applied medicine to his wounds. It stings!\nThe nurse huffed, \"You kids don't know restraints even while sparring.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Blame my opponent for going so wild.\"\nThe nurse frowned, \"I heard what happened. Why didn't you back out?\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Having the capability to defeat the opponent yet surrendering? Quite unbecoming of a warrior I would have been.\"\nThe nurse didn't say anything after that and continued to patch up his wounds.\nIt was rare for Austin to get injured this much. He generally heals himself in his office since he doesn't incur more than a wound or a shallow cut, during training.\n\"Get up….I need to remove your shirt.\" There were some wounds on his torso and back, which she needed to clean before applying bandages.\nAustin was about to get up when suddenly someone interrupted, \"Let me take care of him.\"\nThe nurse turned around and raised her brows seeing a frowning Valerie standing there.\n\"You can manage it, right?\" The nurse asked as she got up from the seat.\nValerie nodded before the older one walked away—heading towards the patient which needed much more medical attention at the moment.\nValerie has seen several wounded persons in the past—given she has gone on a few excursions with the battalions to get some field experience.\nShe has been severely wounded multiple times in the past as well, during training and hunting. However, none of those wounds ever made her this shaken up as she was at the moment.\nHer hands trembled when she unbuttoned his shirt and looked at his wounds.\n\"Hey…I am fine, you know.\" Seeing her shed tears, Austin assured her.\nValerie wordlessly picked the wet clothes\nbefore bringing it near the slit at his waist.\nShe softly cleaned the blood before taking the cotton pad and applying it to his injury.\n\"Val…\" Austin held her hand and made her look at him, \"Will you say something? More than my injuries, I am more troubled about you now.\"\nHe cupped her cheek and saw the girl closing her eyes and weeping in silence.\nShe nestled her face in his warm hand, allowing her aggressively beating heart to attain some much-needed peace.\n\"You do know that I will continue to get injured in the future, right? After all, I want to become stronger…so I can stand beside you.\" Austin told her and someone who encouraged her Lord to participate in the tournament, Valerie knew he surely would get injured while trying to develop his skills.\nHowever…at that time she didn't think she would feel so much grief seeing him like this.\n\"...I know…and I apologize for behaving so unreasonably, my lord. However, I just can't…seeing you like this…makes me…\"\nAustin pulled her to sit beside him and wrapped the lady in his arms.\nIt might be the first time that someone cried for him over some injuries. In his previous life, his parents never cared about him enough to get worried over his pain, and even in this life, Austin was awarded with some irresponsible parents.\nSo yes, Valerie was his first.\n\"You know Val…during my battle, there came a time when I thought I should give up,\" He confessed,\n\"However, when I remembered that my fiancée was watching me…I decided that I can't have her see my lame side.\"\nValerie couldn't stop herself from giving a soft chuckle even while she was weeping, \"You won't have looked lame even if you have faced defeat.\"\n\"Yeah, but I wanted to impress you. So tell me, Val…\" Holding her shoulders he looked her in the eyes, and asked,\n\"Are you proud of me?\"\nValerie fondly smiled, feeling a sudden intimacy with her Lord when he asked that.\nShe placed her hand over his, squeezing it gently as if to reassure herself as much as him before she honestly answered,\n\"Yes, Austin, I am proud of you.\"\n—-------**-------\nAfter things calmed down and Valerie finished applying medicine she went to bring something to drink.\nLeft alone, Austin checked the notifications which the system sent during the battle,\n[Ding!]\n[A new index has appeared!]\n[Durability: 11/100]\n[Ding!]\n[Upon reaching the first tier, the Host is awarded with the skill 'Adapt'!]\n[Adapt: Allows the host to learn and copy the ability of their opponent for a short duration!]\n[Time limit: 3 minutes]\n…\nAustin heaved a sigh. Now he understood what happened back then.\nThe reason he suddenly was able to utilize the same technique as Parkinson and strengthen his body using Aura was that the system activated 'Adapt.'\n'Good timing, buddy.'\nHe would need to ask more about that skill, which sounded extremely useful, but for now, he rested back and thought about Parkinson.\nDuring the battle, Rhea cheered for him, which wasn't in the plan, but she did. Considering she was displeased by Parkinson's demand to spar against Austin and how the Protagonist mutually supports all the people she considers her friends, it wasn't unnatural for her to cheer for him.\nAfter all, if she cheered for Austin then she came to stop him as well, when Austin was going out of control.\nParkinson lost his cool mid-battle and swore to kill him…and that was extremely helpful for Austin.\n'You have dug the perfect hole for yourself, Parkinson…now I just need to give a slight push, and you are out of the game.'\n—-------**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 20: Chapter 19- Two-faced?\nRhea was troubled about several things these days.\nAfter the incident with Valerie, several things changed in her life.\nIt was going well. Until that day…her friends were close to her. Her teachers were fond of her. And most of all, her friends—Austin, Adolf, and Parkinson respected each other quite well.\nHowever, after that incident when Austin took Valerie's side—which was the correct thing to do—Parkinson has been behaving strangely lately.\nHe always seemed to be antagonizing someone…or to be more accurate, his scorn seemed to be directed at Austin.\nShe was aware that he deeply cared about her; however, blaming someone who took the right call and cleared the misunderstanding ... yeah, Parkinson was wrong there.\nAnd then there was Austin.\nAlthough she couldn't say anything in regard to his changed behavior towards her, it felt strange.\nShe…didn't know how to express it.\nWhen he decided to stop eating with them or when it was he refused to give her something she wanted.\nBy no means was she a demanding girl who wanted to attain whatever she desired. However, that day when he pulled away that chocolate box…Rhea was slightly hurt.\nAnd then…his sudden intimacy with Valerie. In the classroom and before the battle…when he pulled Valerie closer and whispered things…it made her feel that either he was pretending to be this close to her, or he might be actually—no, that can't be possible\n'No one can fall for someone in just a day after ignoring them for a year…' Rhea assumed that Austin was playing with Valarie's heart for his selfish interest.\nBut why? And what could force the Prince to take such a cheap route?\nShe didn't know…and didn't want to focus on it.\nShe first needed to take care of Parkinson.\nEntering the infirmary she was met by the worried look of the nurse.\nRhea frowned, \"What happened?\"\nThe nurse was startled to see her all of a sudden, however, her eyes soon said 'Perfect timing!',\n\"Tell me, Rhea, have you seen Parkinson?\"\nRhea frowned, \"He is not here?\"\nThe nurse's face looked pale, as she shook her head, \"No…his bed is empty.\"\nRhea heaved a sigh and rested her hands on her shoulders to calm down the lady, \"Relax, Hilary. Parkinson always carries several potions and he doesn't like to sleep anywhere other than his bed…he must have gone back to his room.\"\nThe nurse looked evidently calmer as she asked, \"Can you do me a favor and check on him?\"\nRhea nodded before she glanced at the bed where Austin rested…however, he wasn't there anymore.\n'Valerie must have taken him away…'\nWordlessly she took written permission from the nurse before heading toward the dormitory\nShowing permission from the nurse to the warden, she heard him saying, \"Cover your head and don't take too long.\"\nRhea nodded as she used her shawl to cover her head and walked inside the building.\nShe has come here twice before, but the first time to meet a guy.\nAlthough she assured the nurse, Rhea was herself quite anxious about Parkinson.\nHurriedly ascending to the first floor she beelined towards Parkinson's room.\nShe was afraid of being seen by someone and being called things that no girl desired to be regarded as.\n*Knock*\nShe waited for a minute, before,\n*Knock* *Knock*\nThis time she didn't have to wait as the door slowly parted from the inside, and a grim face popped out.\nParkinson was expecting Morkel to be there, however, seeing Rhea, he was startled.\n\"Y-You…\"\n\"Yes, it's me. Now, let me in?\" She didn't want to stand here and get spotted so she suggested.\nParkinson nodded hurriedly but then he stopped and told her nervously, \"You can't come in. Tell me right here.\"\nRhea frowned, \"What is it with you? Is there someone inside you don't want me to see?\"\nParkinson looked mildly irritated as he asked, \"Can't you just finish what you came for and leave? Your presence is only going to cause rumors if people see you.\"\nNow Rhea was annoyed as well, as she said, \"I was worried for you, so I came to check up on you, and you are giving me that attitude?\"\nParkinson's lips curled in a mocking smile as he said, \"After cheering for Austin when he was beating me into a pulp, you came here to see if I am doing good? When did you become such a two-faced person, Rhea?\"\nRhea's brows knitted in a frown as she scowled, \"I was cheering for you as well, Parkinson. It's just that you were so obstinate in thinking that I am against you that you never heard me.\"\nParkinson snickered, \"You won't believe it when I say this, but Rhea, my eyes and ears always remain devoted to you. So you think I wouldn't have noticed if you were really happy when I was on the dominating side?\"\nRhea was so angry at that that she wanted to laugh, \"First you chose to fight against someone who clearly was weaker than you, then you showed such brutality which is not befitting for someone to showcase during a spar, and you believe I should be proud of you because of that?\"\n\"No one is asking for your validation, Rhea. So shut the crap and scram.\" He spoke with a blooming smile.\nRhea clenched her fist, her teeth grinding. Her eyes turned wet, which startled Parkinson, given he had seldom seen her cry. However, before he could have approached her, she raised her hand to stop him and muttered, \"Your recent behavior is making me wonder whether I ever knew you.\"\nSaying so, she turned on her heels and walked away while wiping her eyes.\nParkinson's hand remained raised for a long time, watching her back until it disappeared from the corner of the gallery.\nSoon he clenched his hand into a fist, as through his gritted teeth, he muttered,\n'It's all because of that damn dog!'\nSlamming the door behind him, Parkinson returned to his room.\nUnbeknownst to him, that night, a person from the infirmary disappeared.\n—------**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 21: Chapter 20- Caught(1)\nThe next day at school, Parkinson was sitting in his seat silently, his aura explicitly telling people to stay away from him.\nRudolph as well, didn't approach him. Although he didn't possess common sense as others, he knew the reason behind his gloominess.\nHe heard from Rhea what happened last night when she went to check on him.\nRudolph was displeased at how he behaved, however, Rhea told him to not talk about it to anyone and especially Parkinson. She said the green-haired needed some time alone.\nThe class instantly quieted down when suddenly a certain violet-haired girl walked inside, her steps remained a little hurried but elegant.\nShe had a frown on her face, and her current demeanor made people even more frightened than they were of Parkinson's.\nHer feet stopped only once she was in front of Rudolph before she asked, \"Did you meet Austin in the morning?\"\nRudolph frowned before shaking his head, \"Of course not. He must be resting in his room so he didn't invite me to his office as well.\"\nValerie's frown deepened, and unlike what others thought, she didn't go to sit in her seat but rather made her way out of the class.\nRhea also got up from her seat and followed Valerie—forgetting all her reservations towards the girl, she asked,\n\"What happened?\"\nValerie ignored her and continued to move toward the teacher's building.\nRhea was not annoyed—she was accustomed to it—and silently followed the girl until they reached the staff room.\n*Knock*\nEvery teacher, those who were preparing to leave for their classes and those who were preparing study materials, all turned toward the violette and shivered.\nAmong them was a senior Professor who stepped forward and asked, \"Student Valerie? Is everything alright?\"\nIt was rare for her to be seen anywhere around during the lecture hour.\nValerie, spoke in a grave tone, \"Student Austin is nowhere to be found. I talked to his butler and he isn't in his room and not anywhere in the school.\"\nRhea's eyes widened, \"Didn't he return to the room with you.\"\nValerie felt annoyed because of her nonsensical questions, \"Do you think I will enter the dormitory?\"\nRhea sealed her lips, feeling a little embarrassed now.\nThe teacher frowned; unless it had been serious, she wouldn't have come here.\n\"Okay, I will go and search the dormitory. Meanwhile, go and look for him in the gymnasium.\"\nValerie nodded and instantly dashed away.\nThe Professor told Rhea to look for him in the cafeteria while he asked another teacher to go and look in the bathrooms.\nInstantly more than ten people were looking for him.\nNot only was Austin a student of the Academy, but he was the Prince of the country as well. Although noble status doesn't matter when they are within the academy, they all know the consequences they might face if something happens to Austin.\nNot so long after, students also started to realize that something was wrong as their homeroom never began even though it was already past the hour.\nThe representative of every class began to come out and ask what was happening.\nSlowly, as the minute passed, news spread like wildfire. Slowly every student got to know that Austin was missing.\nHe wasn't found in any gym or other training grounds. He wasn't in the front garden or any washroom. The cafeteria was empty and the chef said he didn't spot Austin in the morning as well.\nThe tension was growing with passing each moment. The students were told to self-study at the moment while the Council members were asked to search for him in every corner of the school.\nThe guards were asked if they spotted Austin going out of the academy. However, they confirmed that they never saw him around the entrance.\nOnce the Headmaster heard about it, he instantly assigned a crew to go and look for him outside the Academy.\nMeanwhile, the warden of the male and female dormitory was told to search each building thoroughly with the help of the students.\nParkinson was indifferently reading his books, not minding the chaos around him. He couldn't care less about Austin, if anything, he would be happy if the blond dog realized his worth and left the academy.\nHowever, suddenly he heard something fleetingly, that made every strand of his body erect in alert,\n\"It seems they are going to search everyone's room as well-\" The boy who said that, instantly turned still as he was grabbed by his collar and lifted off his seat.\n\"What did you just say?!\" Parkinson shouted.\nThe boy snarled and pushed Parkinson with enough strength to make him stumble back,\n\"Don't you ever grab my collar again,\" He threatened.\nParkinson clenched his fist, his aura flaring, but the other guy didn't back off—ready to retaliate if Parkinson attacked.\nHowever, he didn't remain here to engage in mindless battle and bolted out of the classroom\nHe can't let them enter his room. No one can see what was in there…no one!\n…\nThere was no option left other than entering every room and searching for Austin inside every student's dormitory.\nIt was known that Austin was injured and under the effect of a pain-relieving drug last night, so there was a chance that he accidentally entered someone else's room and fell asleep.\nHowever, the search didn't begin from the first room on the first floor but a certain room on the second floor.\nThe Headmaster stood before Parkinson's room with the other Professors and a few students. Even Valerie and Rhea were present, under special circumstances.\nThe Headmaster was about to tell the Professor to enter the room when suddenly,\n\"Wait!\" Someone dashed inside the gallery and ran towards them.\nParkinson weaved through the crowd and stood before his room door, his arms extended to block the door as he said,\n\"You can't go inside!\"\nNow the suspicion was much more profound.\nThe Headmaster wordlessly glanced at one of the professors before he extended his hands, and easily, Parkinson was pulled away.\nThe supreme authority stepped forward and pushed open the door.\n—-----**------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 22: Chapter 21- Caught(2)\nIf Parkinson had the option to end this world right now, he wouldn't have thought twice about blowing it all up to cover the things everyone is about to see.\nThe door of his room was parted and everyone was assaulted by a strong scent of potions.\nThe headmaster frowned and glanced at Parkinson, \"You were forbidden.\"\nThe green-haired scoffed, \"That's the tradition.\"\nThe one who was holding Parkinson growled, \"Speak respectfully, or your crimes will continue to pile up.\"\nThe teenager winced as his arms were twisted behind his back until the Headmaster gestured for him to stop.\nThe bespectacled man, formally known as Philius Croweb, heaved a sigh as he stepped inside the room.\nHe was aware that in the place where Parkinson comes from, potion-making is a very common job and something they take pride in. However, in this nation, to make a potion, one needs to gain a license first.\nPhilius naturally warned Parkinson when the teenager demanded to get himself a seat in the academy, however, Parkinson broke his promise.\n\"Oh, my lord...\" The Headmaster's eyes stretched wide as he looked at the student's room, which was filled with nothing but a certain pink-haired girl.\nEvery corner of the room has something that is related to Rhea.\nFrom the bedsheet to the couch, from the mat to the stuffed toys. Parkinson has painted everything in the shade of his classmate.\nThe other teachers were also disgusted at how Parkinson had decorated his room. It looked nothing less than horrifying, and most of all, Rhea was affected by all this quite severely.\nHer feet felt numb as the girl couldn't believe what her eyes were showing her.\nValerie indifferently looked at the surroundings before she stepped forward and began searching the room\n\"Rhea...please listen to me. I wanted to tell you about my feelings but all the drama with Valerie and Austin...please trust me, my emotions were pure—\"\n\"Just...just shut up!\" Rhea clasped her hand before her face and begged him to close his mouth. Her voice was hoarse since she barely prevented herself from vomiting just now.\nThe same person she thought was pure and considerate was so...disgusting and deceiving all this time?\nParkinson was left speechless. He wanted to say something but couldn't utter a single word and just continued to move his mouth like a fish for a couple of minutes before suddenly, Valerie said,\n\"There is something in there.\" She frowned upon noticing the shallowness of the wooden floor beneath her feet compared to the other sides.\nShe summoned her Soul Shard and tore away the carpet—slashing Rhea's face drawn on it, in the process.\n\"STOP YOU!!\" Seeing Parkinson aggressively trying to break free, everyone's suspicion rose.\nEveryone gazed at the slight cracks in a square, signifying there was a secret door.\nThe headmaster gave Valerie the nod before the violette extended her shard burnt the lock on the small door, and raised her foot to stomp on it,\n*CLINK*\nThe lock broke instantly and the door was flung open to the other side—however, the door didn't completely open as there was something that prevented it from showing everything inside.\nAll the color from Valerie's face disappeared when her gaze landed on the strands of golden locks.\nVery slowly she stepped closer and pulled the door back before using her Aura to strengthen her body and tear away the door—only to find her body freezing the moment her gaze landed on the person lying half dead there.\n\"A-A-Austin....\"\nPhilius instantly jumped inside and picked up the young man in his arms before pressing his fingers on his wrist.\nThose few seconds, he took were like an eternity to Valerie. She looked at her Lord with her eyes blurred by her tears.\nShe died several times in those few seconds before the headmaster nodded and told her, \"He is alive.\"\nShe slumped back on her legs, hearing that, allowing her breath, which had been stuck in her throat for a long, to seep out.\nValerie's face was hidden behind her long hair as she stared at Austin's battered body for a few seconds then suddenly,\nSomething snapped.\nValerie's trembling hand clenched into a fist as her eyes locked onto Parkinson. That glance alone was enough to horrify not only Parkinson but the Professor holding him.\nHer body began to radiate a palpable aura of fury—dark and suffocating, like a storm tearing through the academy. The air grew heavy, each breath dragging as if the weight of her rage pressed down on everyone in the room.\nParkinson stumbled back, his knees buckling under the crushing force. \"W-Wait! I didn't—\"\n\"Enough!\" Valerie's voice was a raw snarl, and her body erupted with Soul energy. Her shard glowed ominously, jagged cracks of light spilling out from her clenched hands.\nThe ground trembled beneath her as the walls groaned under the pressure of her unrestrained power. The temperature in the room plummeted, and a piercing chill swept through, sending shivers even through the most hardened teachers.\n\"She's losing control!\" one teacher yelled, gripping their staff tightly to form a barrier around Parkinson.\n\"Valerie, stop!\" another teacher cried, stepping forward to hold her back.\nBut it was futile. Valerie took a single step toward Parkinson, and the shockwave of her aura knocked the teacher to the ground, their barrier shattering like glass.\n\"You put him in there…\" Valerie hissed, her voice trembling with grief and rage. Her movements were slow but deliberate, like a predator toying with its prey. \"You tortured him.\"\nParkinson whimpered, his face pale as death. The very blood in his veins felt as if it had frozen solid. \"I—It wasn't me! You have to believe me—!\"\n\"Believe you?\" Valerie's shout reverberated through the academy, shaking the chandeliers and cracking the windows. Her Soul energy surged like a tidal wave, blasting through the room.\nOne by one, the teachers stepped forward, each unleashing their power to suppress her. Defensive shields, binding spells, and suppressive sigils flared to life, encasing Valerie in a cocoon of shimmering light.\n\"Hold her down!\" the headmaster ordered sharply.\nThe combined effort of the teachers strained against Valerie's immense strength, but she continued to advance, her burning gaze fixed solely on Parkinson. Each step forward sent cracks racing along the floor, fissures spreading through the very foundation of the academy.\nRhea had already been shot away by the immense force and couldn't even get up because of the invisible weight she was feeling all over her.\nHer voice was low and guttural as she whispered, \"You'll pay for this.\"\nA flash of her Soul Shard illuminated the room, and a deafening roar of power erupted from her, blasting through the suppressive spells like paper. The teachers were hurled back, slamming into walls and furniture, groaning as they struggled to regain their footing.\nValerie raised her hand, her shard blazing with murderous intent, aimed straight at Parkinson's trembling figure.\nPhilius clenched his teeth as he removed the glove from his hand, 'Guess there is no option...'\nHowever, before he could have stopped Valerie, Austin suddenly called out,\n\"Val...\"\nIt was a very soft hum, which Philius barely heard—however, it worked like a wonder, slicing through the immense Aura of the girl, the whisper reached her ear, and instantly, Valerie stopped in her track and upon turning around, she saw her beloved raising his hand in her direction, and softly gesturing her to come closer.\nTears began to rain down her eyes as she walked through the broken mess of a room, and knelt beside her Lord.\nPhilius heaved a sigh and allowed her to take a hold of Austin as the violette hugged her beloved close to her and for the first time, everyone heard Valerie crying.\n---------**--------\nA/N:- Okay, yeah, she is that strong.\nDrop a comment.",

People might call it going to some extreme length to trap Parkinson, but he had to.\nUnder no other crime would he have been expelled from the Academy except for kidnapping and possible murder of a fellow schoolmate.\nIt was necessary to get rid of Parkinson since Austin had already shifted the plot by not letting Valerie get suspended. So he chose to act first rather than letting his opponent make strategies and try to harm him or his beloved.\nThe only person who could have changed things, and completely demolished his plans was Valerie. He knew her strength and the extent of her love for him.\nIf she had harmed Parkinson or, worse, killed him, things would have taken a very awful turn. That's why, despite having the plans of remaining unconscious for the entire time, Austin chose to wake up and stop his fiancée.\nNow, inside the infirmary were several teachers and the Headmaster. It has been a few hours since Austin was rescued and thanks to recovery potions, he can barely talk.\nUnder normal circumstances, the Headmaster would have let Austin recover first, but things soon were going to turn hectic.\nOnce the father of the suspect gets informed about the situation, by no means would he let Parkinson remain in the academy anymore. Parkinson would be taken away under the pretense that he would be judged by his father. But in the end, the teenager wouldn't get punished.\nSebastian was using a cotton pad to clean the wound on his master's cheek as the blond Prince heard the supreme authority asking, \"Austin...do you remember what happened?\"\nAustin looked dazed for a moment, his eyes situated on nothing particular as he thought back on what happened before he informed,\n\"I returned to my room late at night...and fell asleep instantly. Then suddenly, my sleep was disturbed in the middle of the night because of some awful scent.\"\nValerie's hand trembled hearing that, and the Professors flinched—ready to subdue her this time if things went out of control. However, Austin held her hand and gave her an assuring look, as he continued to talk,\n\"I saw a pair of green eyes who were pressing the fabric against my mouth....and the smell was making me dizzy and sluggish. I couldn't muster up the courage to fight against him.\"\nPhilius frowned, \"Was it the scent of used socks?\"\n\"Y-Yes...that's it. Very awful.\" Austin affirmed.\nThe headmaster nodded, before he informed others, \"It's the Dizzy Dew—given to prisoners during interrogation to prevent them from killing themselves.\"\nEveryone in the crowd was aware of the potion, as the nurse said, \"I thought such a potion is prohibited to bring in the academy?\"\nPotions have always been a sensitive topic in the academy, and due to some previous events, all the ingredients of the potions are closely monitored.\nPhilius grimly said, \"Parkinson must have received the materials through his weekly parcels from his hometown.\"\nTurning back toward the younger one, Philius wordlessly urged Austin to continue.\n\"After that...I was feeling someone was hitting me...using a blunt object but I wasn't able to react at all. My Aura was not working as well nor could I muster up the strength to cry out for help.\"\nSuddenly, a voice emerged from the crowd, which attracted everyone's attention, \"If I may ask, Sebastian, where were you when all this happened?\"\nIt was Morkel who walked inside the infirmary and questioned the loyal servant from the royal family who had the duty to protect the young master all the time.\nNaturally, if Sebastian had been around Austin would have never been kidnapped.\nEvery eye then turned towards the grey-haired man but it wasn't him who answered the question.\n\"I sent Sebastian to patrol around the premises. Since Harold and a few professors are not in the academy for the time being, we were short on staff members.\" The Headmaster informed before his brows drew closer,\n\"What are you trying to imply here, Morkel?\"\nThe bespectacled one raised his hands and innocently stated, \"I am not making any judgments here, sir; however, we need to look at things from different angles as well.\"\nAdvancing towards them, he stood while facing Austin before uttering, \"There must be a severe reason why student Parkinson suddenly decided to kidnap Austin.\"\nAustin stared at the man with an indifferent look—he knew that until he was here, he wouldn't let Parkinson get punished so easily.\nFortunately, the one who gave him the proof was someone from his team, \"There was a reason, Professor.\"\nThe tallest one in the room called out, urging everyone to look at him as Rudolph added,\n\"Yesterday, in the morning, when Austin invited Parkinson to talk, he left his office while shouting madly. Several students saw him threatening Austin.\"\nMorkel frowned, \"Did you hear it from someone?\"\n\"Yes, many students were talking about it. If you want you can confirm it from them.\"\n\"And we shouldn't forget about the spar yesterday. We all heard how Parkinson was showing his grudge during the battle, continuously swearing to kill Austin.\"\nThe instructor in charge of the battle yesterday, added.\nPhilius frowned before his eyes went towards Austin, and he asked, \"Do you know the reason?\"\nAustin thought for a moment before responding, \"...maybe because I took Valerie's side in the trials that pissed him off?\"\nIf Austin had said that a few hours ago, no one would have believed that Parkinson could take such a big step just because of that. However, after witnessing how madly he is obsessed with Rhea, it doesn't sound implausible.\nIt was not unknown to others that Austin and Rhea were close, and someone who is so madly in love with Rhea, surely would see Austin as an enemy.\nThe evidence was against him and Philius seemed to have reached a conclusion.\nHowever, before he could have said anything, a Professor entered the infirmary and stated,\n\"Headmaster! The Prime Minister from the Hener kingdom has arrived.\"\nThe Professor began to murmuring, wondering how the new reached Parkinson's family so soon.\nWhile Austin kept his cold gaze constant on Morkel'sh smiling ones.\n'This assh*le is hell-bent on ruining my plans...'\n---------**--------\nA/N:- Yeah, not everything can go according to the plans..",

      "content": "Chapter 24: Chapter 23- Sudden arrival(2)\nMorkel knew something was wrong when he reached the academy this morning, and it did not take more than half a minute for him to discern the whole thing—thanks to his information sources.\nIt seems the Prince has finally found the use of that thing that resides between his ears. Until now, he has been so simple-minded and idiotic at times that Morkel never thought that Austin would plot so cunningly against Parkinson.\nWhy wasn't Morkel not believing Austin? Was it because he was close to Parkinson or because he hated Austin? None. It was because he knew Parkinson wouldn't take such a major step with so many traces left behind.\nMorkel knows Parkinson's style; he kills on the spot rather than dragging his prey to his house where he could get easily caught. Morkel was closely aware of everything and everyone that surrounds Rhea, so naturally, he discerned that Parkinson didn't abduct the Prince, rather, the blond bastard set this whole thing up.\nHowever, considering the Prince took this major step which could get him expelled easily if caught, Morkel knew that Austin wouldn't have done half-hearted work.\nThe bespectacled Professor knew that if things didn't work out, quite well, he had to keep a Plan B to ensure Parkinson's safety. After all, there were still things that Parkinson needed to do for Morkel.\nThat's why Morkel informed the Prime Minister of the Hener Kingdom. The Professor was aware that the Prime Minister was around since he was sent to escort the Minister to the Kingdom just this morning.\nAnd thankfully, just when Morkel wanted the Minister arrived at the academy. And not alone; he brought a very useful pawn along~\n\"Your Highness, Aiden!\" Morkel beamed as he spotted the silver head standing in the common hall along with the Prime Minister.\nPhilius' eyes momentarily narrowed before he greeted, \"Minister Abel. Your Highness Aiden. It's nice to see you in good health.\"\nThe long silver-haired man smiled at the older one before saying, \"You look the same as ever; must be regular exercise and a strict diet.\"\nThe friendliness in his tone wasn't enough for Philius to put his guard down, \"You praise me too much, Your Highness.\"\nTurning toward the two alternatively, he asked, \"So what could be the reason for your sudden arrival?\"\n\"Don't be sly with me, Headmaster, I am quite aware of what treatment my nephew has been facing recently.\"\nHearing that tone, Philius dropped the act and told him, \"Then you must be aware of the crime which your precious nephew has committed, I suppose?\"\nThe atmosphere around the two significantly dropped as Abel kept his condensing gaze fixated on the grey-haired individual.\nAiden stepped in and dissipated the tension, \"Now, now, we all are adults here so let us talk over things rather than partaking in anything impulsively.\"\nHearing Aiden's words Abel scoffed and told the Headmaster, \"You cannot punish my nephew here. His hearin-\"\n\"Student Parkinson has tried to harm student Austin. And since Student Parkinson is a student of the academy which I govern, I will not, under any circumstances, let him get taken away.\" In a single breath and with his voice loud enough to be heard by every single person inside the common hall, the Headmaster stated.\nAbel's complexion shifted to blue and red, showing his anger as he clenched his fist and asked, \"Are you prepared to face the consequences of offending the King?!\"\n\"I see no King here, and if the King is willing to use his name to save a criminal then yes, I am prepared for whatever consequences this can bring to me.\" There was not a spec of hesitation or nervousness in his voice as the Headmaster shared a piece of his mind.\nBefore Abel could have flown in rage, Aiden stepped in, \"However, Headmaster, for the crime Parkinson has committed, I assume you need to bring him before the council of judgment, right?\"\nPhilius frowned, however, he couldn't refute it, \"...yes.\" Above a certain degree, every crime should be presented before the Council of Judgement—a group of judges who form a decision which only the Monarch can dismiss.\nAiden heaved a sigh before asking him, \"Then offer me the chance to take the right call and present the student before the council. Whatever decision they take will be final.\"\nDrawing closer he added, \"And trust me,\nHeadmaster, if it's proven that Parkinson has indeed tried to kill my brother, I swear nothing less than a death sentence would be awarded to Parkinson.\"\nPhilius remained silent for a moment—he was aware that the relationship between Austin and Aiden was complicated, but right now, Philius could see the burning anger in Aiden's eyes.\nAnd even if he tried to, Philius couldn't form a judgment on someone who has abducted a student. In the end, he nodded,\n\"Okay, you can take him.\"\n…However, naturally, he would send people with them who would be Philius' ears and eyes.\n—------**--------\nRudolph found Rhea to be sitting in the garden, acquiring the cornermost seat, which remained hidden by the passerby.\nHer legs were curled as she stared at nothing constant. The stains at the corner of her eyes clearly told that the girl had cried for a long time.\nThe giant boy sat down beside her and offered the pink head some ice cream which he brought along, \"Here…I have heard sugary items help elevate the mood.\"\nRhea looked at the small bowl before saying, \"And you chose the strawberry flavor? Did you want to worsen my mood?\"\nRudolph was startled, \"You don't like strawberries?\"\nRhea didn't say anything and took the ice cream from him.\nWhile she was slowly eating, she asked Rudolph, \"You knew about it…that how…he has been stalking me?\"\nRudolph shook his head, \"No, or I would have stopped him.\"\nFrom further investigation, it turned out Rhea used things like her handkerchief, tissue papers, stationery, and even some of her clothes were found in his cupboard.\nRhea couldn't help but sigh, \"Why always me…\"\nRudolph raised his brows, \"Hmm? Did you say something?\"\nRhea shook her head before smiling at him as she said, \"Thanks for the ice cream. It helped.\"\n—-----**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Drop a comment.",

      "content": "Chapter 25: Chapter 24- Ignored\n\"Did he leave?\" Austin asked as he saw Valerie walking inside the infirmary with a serious frown on her face.\nHearing his voice, her distress turned into concern as she said, \"Yes…it seems he was in a rush to return to the Capital.\"\nAustin chuckled as he invited her to sit on the stool near the bed before he told his fiancée,\n\"You think I will be sad because my brother doesn't care about me or any of my family members didn't even contact me even after hearing about my situation?\"\nHis tone already suggested that he didn't. However, Valerie felt quite sad seeing the indifference from her Lord. She has seen how close he has always been to his parents in the past.\nAustin was the most loved and spoiled child of the family, even though he had two younger sisters. Everyone used to adore him until his elder brother appeared out of nowhere.\nOnly Valerie knows how lonely Austin had become when his parents started ignoring his existence in the name of giving their elder one the time and affection he was devoid of.\nAnd the gap between Austin and his family has turned so wide that having no one to look out for him does no longer affect her Lord.\nValerie didn't know how to feel about it…\n\"Val, I already told you that, except for you, I care about no one. I just want your attention and love.\" He kissed the back of her hand as he softly muttered.\nHe could barely open his eyes; his body was still covered in bandages…yet the affection in his eyes had not subdued even a bit.\nValerie couldn't stop herself from smiling as she brought his hand, pressed it against her cheek, and said, \"You will always have me—until the end and beyond that…I will never leave your side.\"\n—------**-------\nSebastian was currently moving toward the infirmary, when suddenly he heard a voice, \"Wait a moment.\"\nTurning towards the source of the voice, Sebastian lowered his head, \"What can I do for you, Young Lady?\"\nValerie appeared from the shadows while holding a long bag in her hand.\nShe handed the bag to Sebastian, urging the older one to look inside.\nHis eyes widened as he saw there was a steel pipe inside the bag, which was damaged slightly and had severe blood marks on it.\nSebastian looked at the lady and found her arms crossed and eyes narrowed as she said, \"I won't ask why, but in the future, for whatever reason, if you dare hurt my Lord, I won't hesitate to kill you.\"\nSebastian regained his calm before muttering, \"And you know that even death cannot stop me from listening to the young master's command.\"\nValerie's expression turned sour, as she got the confirmation.\nShe already guessed that Her Lord had planned everything the moment she studied his injuries, and inspected his room during the investigation.\nShe turned around and was about to walk away when suddenly the older one said,\n\"He did it for you…wanted to keep you safe.\"\nValerie paused, and without looking at the butler, she said, \"Don't misunderstand me, Sebastian. I am not displeased about this…far from it. After all, I was about to get rid of that snake by myself sooner than later.\"\nWith her fist clenched she added, \"I just can never feel happy about something that caused him pain.\"\nSebastian was once again reminded of how much the young lady adored his young master—and that made him smile.\nAs she resumed walking she told him, \"Don't tell him that I know…\"\n—------**-------\nThere was a severe frown on his face as the man who had similar blond hair as Austin, read the letter.\nThe King of the Eryndor—Cedric Eryndor, read the report he received from the headmaster through an ethereal courier.\n\"What happened, dear?\" His wife, Sophie asked as she saw her husband frowning while reading the letter.\nCedric turned towards his wife before saying, \"It's about Austin…it seems he is injured severely-\" Before he could continue his wife interrupted,\n\"Must have fought with someone. Let the headmaster handle it and stop worrying about it.\" Saying so she went back to sleep.\nCedric heaved a sigh; it wasn't the first time he had seen such negligence from his wife.\nShe no longer takes anything about Austin seriously; brushing it off like he is nothing but a mischievous child. However, here, the matter was serious—Austin was kidnapped and nearly killed.\nAnd his wife…she doesn't even want to hear about it.\n'Because of Aiden, she has completely forgotten about Austin…' He doesn't blame the eldest one for that since Aiden never asked them to ignore Austin.\nHowever, the guilt Cedric and Sophie felt towards Aiden, made them completely ignorant towards Austin.\nBut not this time—this was a very grave matter. His son, the second Prince of the nation was kidnapped.\nCedric cannot take this lightly or others would continue to torment Austin while considering that his family no longer cares about him.\nChanging his clothes, he was about to leave when suddenly his wife asked,\"Where are you going all of a sudden?\" There was displeasure in her voice. After all, it was the first time in years that they got this opportunity to spend time in peace, given Aiden was there to take care of things.\nCedric didn't turn to look at his wife before saying, \"Going to do what a father must do for his child.\"\nSophie frowned….just because of some school fight her husband was leaving her like this.\n'Austin…why didn't you turn out to be like your elder brother?' Sophie couldn't help but complain in her heart.\n—------**--------\nA/N:- Damn, there are people like her who exist in the real world as well. Drop a comment.",

      "content": "Chapter 26: Chapter 25- Favor?\nFor the next few days, Austin was focused on his recovery. He directed Sebastian where to hit so in case he needed to fight someone while he was recovering, Austin wouldn't fall helpless\nAround the fourth day after that incident, the news arrived that the suspect—Parkinson—escaped the convoy that was bringing him to the central capital.\nAround twenty elite soldiers were taking him there yet he escaped—yeah, why not.\nAustin knew something like this would happen, however, he wasn't regretting anything. His primary goal was to make everyone realize his true nature and show Parkinson as a criminal. And by running away everyone now knows that he, indeed, was the criminal.\nThe investigation regarding the matter came to a halt since Parkinson gave them the biggest proof of being the wrongdoer.\nFor his security and others, some soldiers from the capital were stationed at the boy's dormitory, however, Austin declined any security following him except for Sebastian.\nThe Headmaster didn't insist, being aware of Sebastian's skills and devotion to his duties. However, he asked Austin to remain indoors for the time being.\nIt was the sixth day, and today, Austin was supposed to leave the school to reach the Capital on time. After all, tomorrow was his birthday and a ceremony was held to celebrate the return of the first Prince.\nHowever, now, naturally, Austin couldn't go considering his health.\n\"I feel bad for you...\" Austin muttered as, with Valerie's help, he walked into the garden.\nValerie was holding his hand since his left leg was still not completely healed, and her Lord seldom fell while walking.\nRaising her brows, the pretty lady asked, \"Why though? I never liked those flashy ceremonies.\"\nShe wasn't lying when she said that, and the reason why she ever used to join such celebrations was because her father asked her to. Later, Austin invited her.\nAustin paused, and while looking at her, he uttered, \"Except for the yearly holidays during winter, it's only around my birthday when you meet your parents.\"\nA brief wave of shock rendered her speechless as she stared at her Lord with her eyes turning round.\nAustin sighed before telling her, \"Unlike mine, your parents adore you and your siblings equally well, and I am aware of how fond you are of them.\"\nCupping her cheek softly, he asked, \"What do you say, should we take a few days off after I recover and visit your parents? After our engagement, I haven't met them as well.\"\nWith his gaze drifting to the front he added, \"I want to make a good impression on my father in law as-\"\n*Thud*\nSuddenly, Austin was surrounded by the scent of jasmine, and his body was enveloped by a warm sensation as Valerie hugged him.\nAustin was taken aback by the sudden embrace but he soon reciprocated and wrapped his arms around his fiancée.\nHer soft and warm body was addictive; he always felt a great urge to keep holding her for a long time...it makes him calm and elevates his heart rate at the same time.\nValerie had tears in her eyes as she whispered, \"The way you have been considerate about such small things related to me...I feel quite happy.\"\nFor others, it might be trivial; however, for Valerie, the very thought of closing the distance between her parents and himself was a very considerate and loving act.\nA few days ago, even a single glance from him was enough for her to remain content. Even if it was filled with contempt, she loved it when he scolded her. That's why when he suddenly started showing her with all his affection, Valerie wasn't able to hold back herself.\n\"Make a habit of it, Val...my every action will always be aimed to make you happy.\" He softly muttered, and he meant what he said.\nIn his previous life, there was no one he met who loved him so unconditionally, however, now that he had such a person so close to him, Austin was not going to let her go.\nEver.\n.....\nTheir walk came to an end as soon as they decided to share tea before resting in their rooms.\nValerie was silent until the cafeteria, and someone who closely observes her regularly these days, Austin could tell that she was quite embarrassed right now\nAfter all, for a maiden like Valerie, it was too much to suddenly hug a boy, even though he was her fiancé. And not to talk about, so openly!\nThere was a strong urge in him to rub his cheek against hers and pat the girl who can get shy about such trivial things. However, if he does that, there is a high chance Valerie might lock herself up in her room for the next ten days in embarrassment.\n\"You still prefer tea without sugar?\" Valerie looked up and nodded with perplexity vivid in her eyes.\n\"Is it because you want to maintain your health?\" Austin asked curiously.\n\"...I don't need to avoid sugar just because of that since I train enough to avoid getting myself extra weight.\" Valerie added, \"It's just...I no longer like sweet things.\"\nAustin raised his brows as he also picked his black coffee, without sugar. He remembered Valarie once loved sugary things, but slowly, her taste changed....\nDid she intentionally change it?\nHe never got the chance to ask, as suddenly a familiar face appeared before them, \"Hey, Austin?\"\nRudolph sat down beside Austin with concern written over his face.\nThe blond Prince hummed in question before he heard the other one hesitantly asking, \"Can you do me a favor ..and talk to Rhea?\"\nValerie flinched, the hold around the tea cup tightening.\nAustin didn't miss her reaction, however, rather than outrightly rejecting the guy, he asked, \"Why me? You can go talk to her, no?\"\n\"Agh-you know how bad I am at this. I don't know what to say to console someone...and at the moment, Rhea needs someone who can give her some emotional support.\"\nWith his eyes revealing a lot more than his words, Rudolph added, \"...I think this incident with Parkinson...it has reminded her of something bad. I have never seen Rhea being so silent before...\"\nIt struck him then. Austin remembered that small incident that Rhea once mentioned in the story later on, which urges Parkinson to stop his stalker-like act.\nHeaving a sigh, and while holding Valarie's hand, Austin said, \"I will see what I can do.\"\n-----------**----------\nA/N:- Sorrrrrry for not uploading yesterday.

      "content": "Chapter 27: Chapter 26- Sudden visit(1)\nWas there any specific reason for which Austin had to approach Rhea?\nYeah, he had. Not because Rudolph asked him to, but rather, once Austin remembered the reason why Rhea seemed so upset because of that incident, he feared that the Protagonist might end up killing herself.\nAlthough he didn't like the pinkhead much, it was an irrefutable fact that Rhea was a necessary asset for him and this world. She is the only living entity who can summon two soul shards at one time and can slay the Demon Lord.\nAs such Austin has to ensure that she doesn't end up taking any step that can change the world's fate for the worst.\nThat's why after talking with Valerie and asking her to remain nearby, Austin approached Rhea.\nValerie didn't seem to be willing but when Austin told her about Rhea's situation, she didn't say anything. She never stopped him from meeting her, however, when the reluctance in her eyes subdued, Austin felt comfortable approaching Rhea.\nWhy was he being so mindful of Valerie's opinion? Well, of course, he would care about what his partner likes and what she doesn't. In the future there might arise instances where Austin wouldn't like her accompanying someone, so he would naturally express his displeasure.\nAfter his talk with Valerie, he asks Rudolph where he can find the pink-head\n\"The last bench in the garden; where she always goes at times like these...\"\nAustin nodded before, with Valerie's help he walked towards the garden\nOnce they spotted the girl, Valerie said, \"I will be nearby.\"\nAustin nodded before he advanced toward the Protagonist.\nStaring at the sky, she remained sitting silently. Her eyes were red and her whole demeanor showed how tired she was of her life.\n\"Can I sit here?\"\nShe jerked in surprise hearing his voice before turning toward Austin and hurriedly getting up, \"Yeah, sure. Ah, why are you roaming around like this when you haven't recovered yet?\"\nShe saw him limping slightly so she tried to help him—only to flinch as she sensed an ominous presence from nearby.\nHowever, when she turned she found no one there.\n'Strange ..'\n\"The nurse said that it was okay to take a few minutes of walk....\" Austin said while he settled down on the bench.\nRhea didn't bother to check why she felt so horrified just now and sat down beside the blond Prince.\n\"How is your health now? Does it still hurt?\" She asked in concern.\nAustin shrugged, \"Better than before; thanks to Valerie's support.\"\nRhea fondly smiled, \"I saw you two earlier. Seriously, the way she takes care of you...I feel I should learn from her.\"\nAustin smiled—he likes it when someone praises his lover.\n\"Well, she is a sweet girl.\" He sighed as the duo turned momentarily silent after that.\nGlancing at her, Austin asked, \"What about you? How is it going?\"\nRhea didn't raise her head to look at him as she muttered, \"Doing good. Valerie did knock me out back then but it was still nothing compared to how much pain I had received during training.\"\n\"I am not talking about your physical health, Rhea.\" Austin plainly stated, making Rhea flinch.\nShe still refused to look at him as she sighed.\nThere were a few moments of silence and Austin didn't urge her to speak.\nFinally, after she collected her thoughts, Rhea spoke, \"There was someone close to me...when I used to live alone back in the town. He was my neighbor, a sweet guy. He was six years older than me, and when he found out that I lived alone, he started caring about me...you know, providing food once in a while, bringing me stuff from his farm.\"\nThere was a pause, the girl seemingly quite sensitive about the topic, as she continued, \"I adored him as a brother...but it turned out he had some other thoughts about me.\"\nLeaning back, she said, \"One of those days, he drugged me and tried to force himself on me. I escaped since my natural tolerance against drugs is quite strong, and later, when people searched his home, numerous disturbing things were found.\"\nAustin asked, \"Just like Parkinson?\"\nShe glanced at him, before nodding, \"Yup, just like him, that guy was also a creep. Collecting my things and using them for whatnot.\"\nAustin was aware of the incident. Canonically, when Parkinson hears about it, he decides to change himself, and the fact that he once used to stalk Rhea is never revealed.\nA weary sigh seeped through her lips, as the girl muttered, \"That's why...I felt so shaken up when I found out that my best friend was the same as that guy. I was shaken down to my core and couldn't bear to look at Parkinson again.\"\nWith her expression turning a little sad, she added, \"And since that day, I have been ignoring Rudolph as well...I can't tell him the reason why I am like this.\"\n\"Then why did you tell me?\" Austin asked. Rudolph was as close to her as Austin was. However, she didn't hesitate to disclose her past to Austin.\nRhea smiled at the blond one before confessing, \"Because I knew you wouldn't sympathize with me, and that would save me from feeling pathetic.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"I seemed to have formed a very cold perception in your eyes.\"\n\"More like you have reserved all your warmth and love for a certain someone.\" Her smile was contagious, which urged Austin to smile as well, in response.\nRhea got up, \"Okay then, let's go back. I will be fine by tomorrow. Hopefully.\"\nAustin also got up before suggesting, \"You should probably talk to Rudolph. He is quite-\" Austin paused as he sensed someone approaching them.\nTurning towards the person, he noticed it was one of the Professors from the third year.\n\"Austin.\" He said, in between his labored breathing, \"You have been summoned to the Headmaster's office.

      "content": "Chapter 28: Chapter 27- Sudden visit(2)\nAustin was surprised. He really was.\nFrom his knowledge, his father and his mother were on a trip, far away from the capital, and were enjoying their quality time after a long while. After all, there was now someone responsible and mature handling the nation when the King was away.\nNeedless to say, it wasn't Austin.\nHowever, the blond Prince never expected that his father would actually arrive at the Academy after a few days of the incident. And for the most astonishing part, he looked worried.\n\"Austin...how have you been, son?\" Cedric asked, his eyes looking tired, must be because of the long journey, yet he held enough strength to approach his son and help him sit down.\n\"I am quite fine, father. Thanks to the Headmaster's consideration to let me rest more and Valerie's care.\" He responded, not even a speck of resentment or grief in his voice, which greatly startled the King.\nHe had been noticing the way Austin had started distancing himself from them, seldom ignoring his letters and often delaying his arrival back home during the vacations.\nCedric was not surprised, and he couldn't blame anyone else but himself for this. After all, while fulfilling his role as the father of his first child, his eyes strayed from his other one.\n\"I heard what happened from the Headmaster...everything.\" he spoke, his tone turning colder with each syllable, \"And I promise you, I will punish that evildoer who dared to harm you .\"\n\"Then you might as well have to wage a war now, father.\" Austin simply stated as he rested his hands on his thighs.\nThe older one looked at his son in shock for a moment, only to realize the meaning behind his words.\nParkinson was the son of a king, just like Austin, and undoubtedly, after committing the crime, that bastard must have run back to his home—seeking protection behind the man against whom Cedric couldn't casually go.\nDespite having the intention, Cedric couldn't say 'So what? I will still catch him and punish him' since he knew, it would be nothing but a lie. After all, as a father, he can be emotional, but as a king, he has to be rational.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"We both know that Hener provides us with valuable military supplies, and it is one of the vast trade centers for our people. Waging a war against them would weaken us in several ways.\"\nCedric frowned and looked at his son with a disapproving look, \"You don't feel the urge for vengeance?\"\n\"I do but I can't go against someone who is being backed up by a whole nation.\"\n\"You have the support of a kingdom as well!\" Cedric retorted.\nAustin scoffed, \"Do I have? I doubt that.\"\nThe vigor from his face disappeared as the man looked at his son with concern.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Look Father, it would be better if we stop right here and right now.\"\nCedric was feeling defeated seeing his own child having no faith in him. And the worst thing, Austin didn't look affected because of it at all.\nSitting down across from him, Cedric couldn't help but ask, \"You...resent me, don't you?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"Not at all. What makes you feel like I am bitter about something?\"\nCedric didn't say anything about it since he knew he would end up giving him more than enough reason, but there would be nothing he could say to gain his son's forgiveness.\nWith his shoulders slumped and eyes drawn to the ground, the man muttered, \"Even if you hate...it won't matter until you remain safe.\"\nAustin couldn't understand this man. Even in his previous life, he had parents who cared little to nothing about him, and when they came back home once a year, they showered him with love, expecting him to forget all those days when he needed his parents the most.\nHowever, even though the man in front of him looked pitiful, and the original Austin would have melted at the sight, the current him couldn't feel anything for the man at all. No resentment, no pity.\nCedric remained sitting there for another minute before he asked, \"Will you return with me for your birthday? Your sister has arranged a grand feast for everyone back in the capital.\"\n'For me? Yeah, why not.'\n\"I am not in the condition to travel a long distance.\"\n\"Then...should I stay here and celebrate your birthday with you?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"Many important people will be there tomorrow so the King must be around. Not to forget, Mother would be upset if you don't attend the celebration.\"\nAgain, he sensed it. Pure indifference in his voice like he didn't care about the fact that he would be all alone during his most special day.\nCedric didn't say anything regarding it and got up before he turned around. Leaving a few words behind, he walked out,\n\"We are still your family, Austin...please never forget that.\"\nAustin remained sitting in the administrator's office for a few minutes, pondering over what he said.\n\"Family eh...I have forgotten how it feels to have a family....\"\n....\nStanding below the window, with her back pressed against the wall, Valerie heard the conversation between the duo.\nThe way her Lord showed indifference towards his father and things related to his family...broke her heart.\n'He has lost all his hope...' With such thoughts, she turned around and left. Appearing before her Lord as now would push her to expose her grief. And that would hurt him as well.\nShe couldn't change the fact that he was betrayed by his family members, and whatever she does, she can never fill the hole they have created in Austin's heart.\nHowever, she can naturally try to overwrite all those bitter feelings with tender love. Yes, she will do that.\nShe has been hesitant until now, but Valerie would no longer hold back in expressing how she feels about her beloved.\n'You no longer need anyone else, I will be your everything from now on.'\n----------**---------\nA/N:- As someone with a loving family, I pity Austin. And as someone who has a series of failed love stories, I envy Austin.",

He received the notification yesterday when he was with Valarie but since he knew it would take time, he ignored it.\nThen came his father and he completely forgot about the reward.\nHe can see the gift box hanging in the left, which was apparently the mega reward. However, before that, he chose to see what his trickery had gained him.\n[Deceiving face: Allows the host to take the appearance of anyone for ten minutes.]\n[Limitation: Can be used once in thirty hours.]\n[Requirement: A droplet of the target's blood.]\nAustin examined the mask and thought how cool it would have been if he had this mask a few days ago. Framing Parkinson would have been easier.\nIt was a theatrical wooden mask with a smiling face and two holes for the eyes. Something befitting a trickster.\nAustin was about to open the Mega Reward when suddenly he received a notification on the system,\n[Ding!]\n[An exciting offer has appeared!]\n[In exchange for the Mega Reward, the host has the offer to gain the function of 'Inventory'!]\n[This is a one-time offer, and the decision cannot be reversed. Choose carefully.]\nHis eyes narrowed before he asked, \"The mega reward in exchange for Inventory? What if I reject it, will I get an Inventory in the future?\"\nTruth be told, having a pocket dimension to store things was very useful. Considering this world doesn't have spatial storage, it becomes even more desirable.\nHowever, it cannot be denied that the mega reward must have something useful as well.\n[Ding!]\n[There is a chance but rejecting the offer would lessen the probability!]\n\"...\" Isn't it a threat now? Is the system forcing him to accept the Inventory?\nThinking for a bit, he asked, \"Can you tell me the features of the inventory?\"\n[Ding!]\n[Inventory: A pocket-dimensional storage that allows users to store and retrieve items instantly. It ignores weight and size limits, making it perfect for carrying essentials or treasures without burden.]\n[Restriction: No living creature can be stored inside.]\n[Limitation: The inventory size would be 100 cubic meters initially but it can be increased through QoD.]\nAustin raised his brows as he read through the description. The inventory, just as he thought, seemed quite useful.\nProviding an average room size of storage space in the inventory was hefty for someone who doesn't carry along many things. In the future, he can use it to hunt demons and bring them to exchange them for gold.\nNot to talk about, he can carry several weapons except for his Soul Shard.\nWhen his eyes went towards the last word, he asked, \"What is QoD?\"\n[Quest on Demand: For the progression of any index, or skill, the Host can request quests from the system.]\n[Caution: Rejecting three consecutive quests would cease the host's authority over QoD.]\n'Scary...' Austin muttered under his breath before heaving a sigh.\nThis was a difficult choice. He really wanted that Inventory however, he couldn't tell what mega prize was awaiting him inside the box.\nWhat if it turned out to be a powerful spell or a weapon of mass destruction?\nAustin couldn't be a hundred percent sure in this.\n'Ah, fuck it. I need the Mega Reward.' There was no point in pondering; Austin knew he would end up regretting his decision, so why not go with a little surprise and see what's in there?\n[Ding!]\n[The host showed brilliance in keeping loyal to his prize!]\n[In addition to the mega reward, the host would gain the Inventory as well!]\n\"...\" This system....is not normal.\n[Ding!]\n[Tap to open the reward!]\nAustin heaved a sigh and decided to stop thinking about it.\nMentally tapping on the gift box, he was blinded by an orangish-red illumination, urging him to close his eyes.\nSlowly he parted his eyes and found a bow floating before him. Its curved limbs resembling entwined vines, one side glowing deep red like molten ember and the other shimmering vibrant green like fresh leaves. Its grip is adorned with intricate patterns of thorns, and its string glows faintly, shifting between crimson and emerald hues.\nAustin was so dazed that he looked at the description, a moment later,\n[The Death Vow: Whoever the wielder names, the arrow launched from the bow would take their life. Regardless of their origin, gender, or in whichever world they reside.]\n[Usage: 1]\nAustin's lips were parted in shock, but to make sure he was comprehending it right, he asked the system,\n\"So whoever name I chant before releasing the arrow, that being will get killed?\"\n[Indeed, host.]\n\"Even immortal ones?\"\n[Indeed, host.]\n\"Crazy...\" Austin slumped back in his bed, his mind in turmoil at how he could use this to slay so many great dangers approaching. And most of all, the Demon King.\n'The final boss would be slain in a second if I use this...'\nHowever, the Demon King is not in existence as of now, and those who summon that being are unknown to Austin.\nHe cannot be hasty in his decision.\n[For now, the bow is stored in the Inventory. The host can retrieve it anytime.]\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Thankfully, I have the storage, or keeping that glowing bow hidden would have been hectic.\"\n*Knock* *Knock*\nAustin was startled to hear someone knocking on his window.\nIt was only five in the morning so it was dark outside, making him a little wary.\nHe summoned his Soul Shard and slowly approached the window....only to sigh in relief when he saw a familiar pair of Violet eyes peeking at him.\n*Click*\nHe opened the window for Valerie before inviting her inside.\nShe undid her shawl to reveal her reddened face, making Austin worried,\n\"Why did you come here when it's so cold outside?\"\nShyly she lowered her head and faintly muttered,\n\"I-I wanted to be the first to wish you...\"\n\"...\" What mega reward? This is the ultimate reward.\nHis sweet little Villainess.\n-----------**-----------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 30: Chapter 29- His room\n\"Wait for me...it won't take long.\" Saying so, Austin closed the door of the bathroom.\nThey decided to have a walk around the garden together as a part of his recuperation, so he went to take a bath.\nLeft alone in his room, Valerie remained standing at her spot for a few seconds before she started looking around the place.\n'This is the room...where he sleeps...and spends his alone time...' Her heart rate began to accelerate while imagining how vulnerable her Lord must remain in this place.\nTracing the edges of the chair where he sat as if to memorize its texture. Inhaling in the same air where he lives....gave her an unusual sense of relief and excitement.\nHer eyes lingered on the door behind which he stood. She couldn't help but think about what could be on the other side—making her face hot as a strong gulp traveled down her throat.\nHer eyes then traveled toward his bed; it was not much disheveled and only a few wrinkles could be seen.\nShe slowly approached the bed while keeping an ear focused on the door.\n'What am I doing...' Although she knew it was bad for a maiden to be present inside a boy's room, even though he is her fiancé. However, she couldn't stop herself from satiating her curiosity.\nShe sat down on the bed, and touched the spot where he had been lying down a few moments ago,\n'Warm...' Her eyes turned dazed, and before she knew it, she slowly fell onto the bed and brought the pillow on which he rested, in her arms.\nHis scent surrounded her, his warmth making her feel calm yet excited at the same time. She has never felt something like this.\nValerie clutched the pillow tighter, her breath shallow and uneven as she buried her face into it. The faint scent of him—comforting and undeniably his—wrapped around her like an embrace, making her heart race.\nHer fingers brushed over the soft fabric, imagining for a fleeting moment that it was his skin beneath her touch.\nShe closed her eyes, her mind filled with thoughts of Austin. His smile, his voice, the way he looked at her with those gentle eyes. She sighed softly, pressing her cheek into the pillow as if it could bring her closer to him.\nHer hand wandered to the blanket, fingertips grazing over it as she thought about how he must have wrapped it around himself, seeking warmth. The thought sent a shiver through her, a mixture of nervousness and longing.\n'What would he think if he saw me like this?' The question echoed in her mind, but she couldn't pull herself out of the bed.\nHer lips parted slightly as she whispered his name into the quiet room, her voice trembling with emotions she could no longer contain.\n*Click*\nHer eyes widened, the hair strands on her back stood erect in alert, and like a breeze, she flew out of his bed to stand at the exact spot where he left her.\nAustin, freshly out of the bath, froze at his place as he looked at his fiancée, whose face was flushed and eyes watery slightly.\n\"Was I hallucinating, or were you really on my bed?\"\nValerie did her best to retain her composure, however, her reddening cheeks exposed the truth, while she lied through her teeth,\n\"It must be the side effect of the medicine.\"\nAustin raised his brows, barely suppressing himself from chuckling as he asked, \"Why don't you sit down? Not like maidens are not allowed to at least sit on their fiancée chair, right?\"\nValerie knew her Lord was teasing her now. However, she was so embarrassed by her actions just now that she couldn't even mutter a response.\nWordlessly, Valerie sat down.\nAustin asked her, \"Milk tea works for you?\"\nValerie rose from her seat before suggesting, \"Let me prepare the tea.\"\nAustin smiled at the lady and shook his head, \"It's your first official visit to my humble abode. Let me show some hospitality, my pretty lady.\"\nValerie shyly lowered her eyes before she sat back down.\nAustin took the tea leaves from the shelf before putting them inside the boiling pot along with water. He used to like a mug of beer early in the morning, but after his rebirth, his taste changed. After all, no girl likes a man whose mouth stinks of alcohol.\nWhile Austin was preparing the tea, he asked the other one, \"Do you know if there is any change in the tournament preliminaries?\"\nValerie was taken aback by the sudden shift of conversation, she soon answered nevertheless, \"Until now, the students council has received no information regarding the changes. However, considering the new law enforcing an official member of each school in the Valor Council, there can be a few changes.\"\nThe Continental Council of Valor was the group of people who organized the tournament between the seven academies every year.\nHowever, last year, they were blamed for interfering too much. The newspapers further elevated the situation by criticizing the council for showing partial treatment.\n\"You will possibly participate in the elite division?\" Austin asked, a fond smile on his face.\nThere are two divisions in the tournament; for the first and second year, the rookie division is arranged where they need to perform tasks a lot easier and safer compared to the Elite division, in which the third year participates.\nThe difficulty of the tasks assigned to the Elite division was close to the military level.\nOnly a few individuals from the first or second year get selected for the Elite Division, and considering Valerie's strength, she undoubtedly would be chosen as one of the Elites.\n\"Ah...\" Suddenly, Austin found a warm hand overlapping his hand, as Valerie stood behind him and softly whispered,\n\"In the tag team battle...I want my Lord to be my partner.\"\nAustin's breath was caught in his throat as he gazed at her charming eyes, which held a sense of stubbornness.\nAustin couldn't stop himself from smiling before assuring her, \"I will be there with you.\"\n----------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 31: Chapter 30- Soul Shard\nNearly three months there were, for the tournament to officially begin. Austin was barely a D-rank warrior as of now with a weak First-stage Soul Shard.\nIf someone wants to participate in the Elite category, then they should be in B-rank or above, like Valerie, who is an A-rank officially, but unofficially, she might as well have reached S.\nIt must sound almost impossible for someone to progress two ranks to participate in the Elite division. And until now, Austin also was thinking of participating in the Rookie-division.\nHowever, now that his fiancée has asked, by no chance he would participate as a rookie.\nWalking in the garden with their hands connected, Austin asked, \"I will recover by tomorrow and I am hoping you will resume my training by then.\"\nValerie was about to deny his request, considering it was necessary for him to properly recuperate for another week....however, seeing the determination in his eyes and what they talked about just now back in his room, all she could do was to nod.\nThe duo continued to talk things about the tournament and the preparation required when suddenly Valerie asked,\n\"Can I ask you something about your Shard?\"\nSeeing her being so hesitant, Austin was confused, \"Why are you being so nervous?\"\n\"...because I know that you don't like when someone talks about your Shard.\"\nAustin then realized the reason for her apprehension.\nAustin's Soul Shard was a matter to joke about in the past. People used to laugh behind his back about his Soul Shard, calling it weird names. So Austin developed a sense of agitation and always fought the person who talked about his Shard.\nHowever, now things are different.\n\"As my teacher and my fiancée, you have all the right to ask me whatever you want.\" His warm smile removed the stress, making her shoulders relax as she heard him add,\n\"Tell me what you want to know?\"\nHis casual tone allowed her to verify that he wasn't forcing himself here.\n\"Initially, you awaken a small piece of Shard which was of the same size as a stick...then suddenly, one day, you were holding a dagger a few days before the academy assessment test.\"\nValerie remembers everything related to her Lord. She was herself quite disheartened to see her Lord desperately trying to make a weapon out of his Shard back then. However, naturally, he was failing every time.\nBut suddenly, one day, when she went to the palace, a few days before the examination, he was practicing with daggers carved out of his soul.\nAustin dug deeper into his memories to remember what happened that day. Since that day was quite a special one for the original owner of the body, Austin still vividly remembers that day.\n\"You remember I had a bandage wrapped around my head?\" He asked, to which Valerie nodded. She was so excited about the transformation of his Shard that she never asked about his injury.\nAustin informed her, \"A day before that, I went to hunt wild beasts in the forest...all alone.\" Valerie was taken aback,\n\"But you were not allowed-\"\n\"Yes, I know that no royalty is allowed to hunt beasts without taking soldiers along with them. But it was easy for me to escape since the majority of the focus remained on Aiden.\"\nA tinge of sadness flashed in her eyes followed by frustration. How can they be so lenient to not even notice Austin's absence?\nAustin softly caressed her head to soothe her anger as he added, \"I was frustrated that day that I couldn't develop my Shard at all; as such, I went to vent my frustration by killing a few beasts. I didn't know when I returned to my room or when the medic healed me since all night long I was just holding my Shard and sulking at my disability.\"\nValeria grew concerned as she held his arm. Her eyes trembled and she inwardly blamed herself for not being there when her Lord needed her.\n\"At that time, any word from you would have felt like you were making fun of me, so it's good that you didn't approach me at that time,\" Austin assured her, \"It was good that I was alone that night.\"\nHeaving a sigh, he told her what he felt that night, \"I was hoping that either if something happens to the Soul Shard or I just...don't wake up tomorrow.\"\nHer chest tightened, and her hands shook slightly as she tried to process what she'd just heard. The thought of Austin—her Austin—feeling so broken and alone was too much.\nTears bubbled in her eyes, and Austin instantly regretted telling her about it.\n\"If you start crying now...I won't tell you-\"\n\"No, please...I want to know it all.\" Valerie insisted. She wanted to know everything he had gone through; experiencing even a percent of that pain would make her feel that she shared his burden.\nAustin sighed and softly wiped her tears while he relayed, \"...when I woke up, something miraculous happened and my Soul Shard took the form of daggers.\" He finishes quickly so she doesn't feel sad anymore.\nAustin has the recollection of how happy he was that day when something meaningful appeared before him in the form of his Shard. He was jumping on his bed, dancing around, and nearly fell unconscious because of a sudden rush.\nIt took a few moments but Austin somehow calmed his lover and brought her to sit on the nearby bench.\n\"So yeah, this is the whole story behind my Soul Shard. I haven't told anyone about it except for you.\" Offering her some water, he continued, \"However, I cannot say that my Soul Shard has ascended.\"\nValerie blinked in confusion before she finished gulping the water and asked, \"But your weapon did transform, no?\"\nOne's Shard can go through multiple transformations, and considering the form of Austin's Shard changed, Valerie assumed it must have gone through evolution.\nHowever, \"The strength behind my Shard remained the same, and the Astral Dial also said my Soul energy hasn't progressed at all.\"\nValerie frowned. This was unexpected.\nHowever, before she could have asked him something further, someone called out,\n\"Happy birthday, Austin.\"\nIt was Rhea.\n----------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

You are not a hopeless maiden in love who will glare at the woman who once was after your Lord. You need to be forgiving and move forward. Yes, you have to!\n\"Did I do anything wrong?\" Rhea couldn't help but ask the violette with a helpless sigh, \"You are intently staring at me so I thought....\"\n\"I am not staring at you. It's my normal gaze.\" Valerie fought back however, even Austin could tell that Valerie was being anything but normal at the moment.\nHowever, that's what makes her adorable.\nHe hooked his arm with hers before responding to the pinkhead, \"Thank you. Are you out here to work out?\" He asked to cool down the atmosphere a little.\nAfter conversing with the Protagonist, he realizes that all pink heads aren't evil, and this Protagonist isn't unbearable like some other reverse harem protagonists he has heard about from his online friends.\nRhea also removed her eyes from Valerie, seemingly accepting her fate to be always scorned by her, as she said, \"Yep, wanted to shake off the tension a little. Anyway, how old did you turn this year?\"\n\"Seventeen.\" Smilingly he responded.\n\"So any plans today?\" Saying so, Rhea glanced at Valerie, only to find a subtle excitement appearing in her eyes, making it evident that the disciplinary chief must have planned something.\n\"I was thinking of going to the market and buying a few things today.\"\nRhea again glanced at Valerie and found that subtle panic in her eyes now, urging the pink head to say,\n\"Uh-I heard there would be a major sale on clothing items today, so the rush in the market would be quite chaotic. Why don't you go there on the weekend?\"\nAnother glance and Rhea was relieved to see the serenity returning to Valerie's gaze.\n'Phew~'\nAustin was surprised, \"A sale? Off-season? It's unexpected...\"\nSeeing Austin suspecting her words, Rhea suggested, \"You are injured, Austin and the Headmaster have also said to stay indoors for the time being.\"\nThe blond Prince nodded, \"Yes, you are right. Thanks for the advice.\"\nThe pink head gave a smiling nod before she excused herself, \"I will see you in the class.\"\nSeeing the girl depart, Austin said, \"We should also return to our rooms and prepare for the classes.\"He was resuming classes after a long time, so surely he wouldn't want to arrive late.\"\n\"Uh-\" Valerie had something to ask; however, she forgot what it was. However, she knew it was something important.\n\"Yes?\" Austin's brows were raised as he looked at the girl.\nHowever, soon she shook her head, \"It's nothing. Let me escort you back to the dorm.\"\nAustin didn't resist since every minute with Valerie was bliss for him.\n----------**---------\n*Knock*\nAustin was getting ready in his room when he heard the knock, \"Come in, Sebas.\"\nThe door was unlocked, only to reveal the grey-haired man standing on the other side with a soft smile on his face, \"Happy birthday, young lord.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"Did you wake up late?\" Generally, it has always been Sebastian who wished him first. However, today he arrived late.\n\"I was about to approach you, but when I heard Lady Valerie's voice from your room, I took the cue and stayed away until she was around.\"\nAustin paused while he was tying his shoelaces and looked at the man with his eyes slightly parted wide,\n\"Sebastian...you know you are a great man, right?\"\nThe man couldn't stop himself from chuckling, \"I am aware, my Lord.\"\nStepping towards his master, the butler knelt before him and helped him tie his shoe laces.\nSince Austin's leg was injured it was a little difficult for him to perform some of the trivial tasks.\nWhile tying the shoe laces, the older one said, \"It always warms my heart to see how brilliantly you have grown up, my lord. You have made several mistakes, but the fact you learned from your shortcomings makes me feel relieved.\"\nLooking up at him, the butler took out something from his pocket before handing it to Austin, \"This is a small gift from me. Happy birthday, my Lord.\"\nAustin raised his brows in surprise seeing the detailed design on the small pocket watch.\n\"This is something I got from my father when he passed away—an artifact that will allow you to pause the time for a few seconds. However, you can use it only once a month since it takes the Lunar essence of a full moon to recharge.\"\nAustin was thoroughly surprised, \"Isn't it a very dangerous thing you are giving me?\" Just thinking about gaining a few seconds of pause was quite terrifying. One single second of pause can conclude a battle.\nSomething like this should be a national treasure easily, and here...Sebastian was handing it to him? The second Prince and an academy student no less? Was it some kind of test?\nHowever, Sebastian sighed in relief as he spoke, \"I was told by my father to hand it to someone worthy of it. And now, you are wise enough to know its use, My Lord.\"\nAustin was...taken aback. He continued to look at the man for a long time before he leaned forward and wrapped his hands around the man.\nSebastian smiled fondly, like a father comforting a child, he softly patted Austin's back as he heard him saying,\n\"Thank you, Sebas...thank you for trusting me.\" It has been so long for Austin to feel so...accepted by someone. Having a loving fiancée was one thing, but Sebastian gave him familial comfort.\nAustin retained the original owner's memories but not his feelings. Yet, he knew that if the original had ever felt familial warmth, it must be akin to what he was experiencing now.\nThe butler continued to smile as he said, \"If I don't trust you, then who will?\"\n----------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 33: Chapter 32- Not eager?\nNot so long after, Austin could be seen heading toward the school building with a content smile on his face.\nSebastian is quite a good man—he realized it again today. Not because he gave him a priceless artifact that would be quite vital for him in the future, but rather because of the trust he showed in Austin by handing him such a dangerous tool.\nIt wasn't like Austin was searching for validation until now; however, being regarded as a sensible person by someone whom Austin respects was quite elating.\nEntering the classroom, he was about to approach Valerie and tell her about the morning...when suddenly he paused upon feeling the oppressive aura from a certain corner of the class.\nHe turned his eyes and found the source of such intense force was none other than his fiancée who was sitting in the front; in her usual seat rather than with him.\nApproaching his beloved, Austin glanced at others and found how each student was seated on their seats rather than moving around or chatting with others as they usually do before the homeroom. Just the aura of the lady was enough to warn them.\nAmidst the dark raging storms, Austin was that serene breeze that brought the hurricane to a halt,\n\"What happened, Val?\" He asked as he arrived before her, startling Valerie.\n\"Ah-n-nothing. Good morning.\" She collected her thoughts and greeted him immediately.\nShe was so occupied in her thoughts that she completely missed his arrival....hm?\nAh!\nAustin suddenly had a realization, \"Did the teacher reject your request to change seats?\" Seeing how her bag was still on her usual seat even though they promised to sit together, Austin discerned the cause of her distress.\nValerie's eyes widened as if she was being accused here. However, soon her demeanor returned to normal as she realized lying to her Lord would be a criminal act for her.\n\"Yes...I am upset because my request was rejected.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"I guess it's because of the frequent changes of seats that other students have been making these days that the teacher deemed it wrong to let anyone have their seats changed.\" Austin discerned the reason for the teacher to reject something the ideal student requested.\nIt wasn't like Valerie didn't understand the reason, however, why was she obliged to always follow the rules while the other students just do whatever they want?\n\"I will also break the rules and sit with you.\" She suddenly got up and exposed her desire.\nHowever, \"If you change seats now after getting rejected by the Professor, they will think that you are also undisciplined like other children, and don't give importance to the Professor's words. That would leave a very bad impression of yours.\"\nAlthough Austin dearly wanted to sit with his Princess, he wouldn't suggest she adopt the method of an unruly student. Or she would become the same kind of student whom she usually punishes.\nIt wasn't like Valerie didn't understand what her Lord was trying to convey here, however, she couldn't stop herself from muttering,\n\"It seems...I was the only one...who was eager to sit together...\" Her voice was low, and it might be his imagination, but he found his little Villainess to be pouting slightly as well.\nMorning sweetness: received.\nHolding her hand softly, he pressed her palm against his cheek, making her shiver slightly as he told her,\n\"How can you say that I didn't want to sit with my lovely fiancée? It's just we need to be a little patient and wait until the month-end seat shuffling. At that time, let's go and request the Professor together. Okay?\"\nValerie's expression softened feeling the warmth of his skin as she slowly nodded, \"Let's do that.\"\nThe atmosphere around the two was so lovely and sweet that no one in the classroom was able to keep their eyes away from them.\nThey couldn't believe that the same girl who was making others sweat bullets in nervousness just a few moments ago was smiling at her fiancé so kindly at the moment.\nAnd much to the duo's and the whole class' annoyance, someone disturbed their moment as he called out,\n\"Happy birthday, bro!!\" Rudolph entered the class, and upon spotting Austin, he didn't think twice before loudly wishing him and slamming his hand on his back.\n*Thwack*\nValerie glared at the big bear before threatening, \"Control your actions or I might have to take some action against you.\"\nRudolph sneered, \"It's my friend's birthday. Naturally, I will be excited.\"\nAustin winced, \"Thanks but tone it down, Rud.\" Tightening his hand around hers, he assured Valerie and asked Rudolph, \"Did you talk to Rhea?\"\nRudolph's smile broadened as he said, \"It's all thanks to you that Rhea seemed her usual self. Thanks mate.\" He was about to give another pat on his back but stopped when he felt the threatening aura from his left.\nAustin nodded, \"Well, I hope next time you will be able to comfort her much better.\"\nRudolph grinned, \"Leave it to me.\"\n\"Okay now, sit down on your seats.\" Along with Rhea, the homeroom professor entered the class, urging everyone to take their seats.\nRhea hurried towards her seat, which was in the front, just a seat behind Valerie, while Austin walked towards his desk, which was in the back.\nThe seating arrangements in the class are done based on one's ranking—and at the moment, Valerie and Austin are at the top and the bottom of the list.\nAfter taking the roll attendance the Professor stood on the podium and said, \"Before starting the class, I would like to remind you all about the assessment tomorrow.\"\nAustin frowned as he listened to the teacher intently.\n\"To maintain your ranking in the class or to improve it, every month this assessment happens. If you perform well, then it will reflect in your final exam scores but if you perform badly, you might get demoted to a different section.\" When the Professor said that, her eyes traveled towards Austin for a moment.\nThe blond Prince realized that his chances of getting demoted were the highest in the class.\n'Damn...gotta ace the test tomorrow!'\n---------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 34: Chapter 33- Spoiling\nValorian Academy—the top-ranking academy in the nation which allows only two hundred students each year to enroll and has only four classes for each group.\nThe last hundred students are regarded as the second division and receive much more attention because of their weak standings during the assessment. The remaining hundred come in the first division.\nIt is said that those in the first division surely receive a good opportunity after graduation. The ranking certificate a student gets upon graduation gives a student priority over other students.\nAs such, it was the dream of every student to pass the academy from the first division and if it was from the first class—the Apex Circle—of the academy, then a golden future is inevitable.\nAustin was able to reach this stage because of his academic brilliance and the hard work he has put into his battle techniques over the years. Since he wanted to make himself look better than his brother and get the attention of his parents, Austin trained each day, day and night, without rest.\nDespite being a Prince and someone with a secure future, he continues to sharpen his skills, as if he doesn't work hard, he might not be able to survive for long.\nDuring those times, it was only Valerie and Sebastian who looked at him from afar and they always remained concerned to see how desperately Austin was trying to become better.\nAfter those sleepless nights, Austin finally reached the Apex Circle of the academy....however, as one could expect from the top students of the kingdom, he was still the twentieth ranked in the class.\nAnd tomorrow, if he doesn't perform well, he might as well get demoted to the Vanguard Divison.\nIn the past, if it had been for his reputation, then at present, it was because of his fiancée that Austin didn't want himself to get demoted.\nDuring the lunch break, Austin was intently thinking about the assessment, and without asking him, Valerie knew the thoughts revolving in his head.\nWith a worried expression, she suggested, \"I will ask the Professor to shift your assessment to a later date.\"\nAustin was startled to hear that, \"No..why?\"\n\"You are still not in your best shape to give it your all.\" Valerie reasoned, her tone a little quieter.\nAustin realized that he might have asked rudely, \"I am sorry, I didn't want to...\" He held her hand softly and told her, \"Thank you for worrying for me, Val, but getting special treatment would be unfair on those who still give their assessment despite being injured.\"\nThis was the school for warriors. Naturally, injuries and wounds were something they incurred daily. And if Austin gets some days to prepare, then surely others would follow suit and ask the same.\nValerie still looked apprehensive, but she didn't foolishly keep insisting and said, \"There is a balm that my mother gave me a few months ago. Let me apply it to your wound today.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"If that makes you feel better then sure. Umm, should we go to the infirmary?\"\nValerie glanced around a bit, the action made her look adorable when she moved her round eyes left and right before she leaned forward and said,\n\"Exactly at seven-fifteen, the dorm warden goes for a walk. I will guide you.\"\nAustin was shocked, \"Are you inviting me to your room?\"\nValerie blushed, hearing him say it so explicitly..\nShe looked at him with an upturned gaze, before asking, \"...you won't come?\"\n\"I will be there.\"\nShe smiled.\nThere was not a chance in seven hell that he would reject such an offer, and more so, when she was asking so cutely.\nAfter a brief pause, he asked, \"What is tomorrow's assessment? The regular sparring?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"Beast hunt; the students would be given a certain time slot to hunt a monster to pass the test and several things would decide the test results.\"\nAh! Austin suddenly realized which arc this was. He has some remembrance about this short arc right after Valerie's expulsion that occurs in the forest when Rhea faces a monster that was not supposed to be there.\nRhea was still a B-rank, and the monsters were only supposed to be of C-rank at best, considering the average levels and battle experience of students.\nHowever, being the protagonist, how could she have faced a normal monster and passed the exam like normal students?\n'So it is tomorrow eh...' Naturally, he could not tell Valerie about it, and considering she would be around, Austin knew that the danger would get subdued much more easily than it did canonically.\n'Poor Rhea...' Naturally, now that Valerie would take down the monster, Rhea's development would be stolen. But not like he could do anything about it.\n\"Austin, I will be around, so if you need my help, just call me, okay?\"\nThe blond Prince gave her a smile of assurance before he asked, \"I should probably clear this task in the minimal time and without damaging the beast's body much, right?\" He asked, a bit uncertain given this mode of assessment was not often adopted.\nValerie nodded and provided him with a bit more details, which generally a student is not aware of, which the Professors take into account while judging a student's skills.\nAustin intently listened to her and inwardly noted everything in his mind so that tomorrow, he could perform well.\nOnce she was done, Austin leaned back in his seat and with a sigh, said, \"I feel quite selfish to have taken advantage of your knowledge.\"\nValerie shook her head, a smile of contentment on her lips, \"As a council member, if I cannot help the one I care for, then what's the point of having this position?\"\nAustin teased, \"Don't spoil me too much or I might start demanding things from time to time.\"\nValerie rested her face on her hand and looked at Austin with a warm gaze, before whispering, \"I would love to fulfill your demands. Whatever they might be.\"\n\"///\" Okay, she might not be thinking about 'it,' but surely when she says things like that, more so with that charming look on her face, even someone with quite an experience as Austin couldn't help but feel shy a little.\n'My fiancée can be dangerous even without a weapon...'\n----------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 35: Chapter 34- Caught?\n[Capital of Eryndor]\nThe palace was alive with celebration, its usual grandeur glowing with bright and joyful colors. The golden spires gleamed in the light of the setting sun, and banners of red and gold fluttered from every corner, adding a cheerful touch to the royal structure.\nThe grand gates, carved with images of mythical beasts, were draped in ribbons and flowers. Musicians stood nearby, playing lively tunes that welcomed everyone with a sense of excitement.\nThe wide marble paths leading to the entrance were lit with torches, their flickering flames casting a warm glow over the arriving guests.\nInside, the great hall was stunning. Lanterns hung from the high ceiling, their soft light making the polished floor shine. The walls were decorated with flowing curtains of green and blue, mixed with garlands of fresh flowers that filled the air with a sweet smell.\nLong tables stood on either side of the hall, covered with all kinds of food and drink. There were trays of shiny fruits, steaming meats, and cakes decorated with intricate patterns. Crystal pitchers sparkled as they held colorful juices and wine.\nThe Lords of several noble houses, their families, and some guests from foreign lands were all gathered around on the joyous occasion of the second Prince's birthday and the First Prince's arrival.\n\"They say it, but I have mostly seen them celebrating the first Prince's return rather than congratulating the second Prince.\" One of the many groups was involved in the conversation relating to the situation with the royal family.\n\"Well, considering their worth it's no wonder that they pay more attention to the eldest one.\" Another woman voiced her opinion, and it wasn't just her who felt this way. Mostly everyone present around the grand hall knows that the eldest Prince is both strong and intelligent. There was no comparison between them.\n\"I have heard that the Second Prince hasn't even returned this year, yet they are celebrating the day.\" The third one muttered with a sneer.\nAnd not only them but many others were aware that Austin didn't return this year for some unknown reason. However, the very fact that they had arranged the celebration made it obvious who held more importance in the royal family.\n...\n\"This is wrong, mother.\" Inside the room of the King, the three family members of the royal family were present, and currently, the eldest child of the Monarch seemed quite displeased.\n\"I was about to return to the Academy and spend the birthday together with my brother. But you arranged everything here and forbade me to go as well.\" Aiden had a frown on his face and his tone was laced with displeasure.\nThe silver-head woman approached her lovely child and said, \"My dear Aiden, your brother chose to remain alone this year and spend the birthday with his fiancée. Your father did ask him to come back but he denied.\"\nHearing that, Aiden's eyes widened slightly, \"He said that?\" He turned his gaze towards the patriarch and found him nodding,\n\"He wanted to spend the day with Valerie.\"\nAiden was surprised. Turning away from them he slowly muttered, \"I thought they didn't have a good relationship? This is too sudden.\"\nHearing his words, the Queen added, \"Isn't it good that now Austin has accepted his fiancée and we don't need to be so worried about him?\"\nA malicious grin extended his lips as the silver-headed prince muttered, \"Yes, indeed, it's quite fascinating that they are now close.\"\nWiping off his smirk, he turned around and asked his parents, \"Duke Corwon is joining the celebration, right?\"\nCedric nodded, \"Yes, he surely will. Is there something you wish to talk to him about?\"\nAiden smiled fondly and told them, \"Just wanted to let him know how his daughter was now happy with her betrothed. After all, as a father, he must be worried about her, no?\"\nCedric narrowed his eyes, however, before he could say something, his wife beamed,\n\"Brilliant, baby. You definitely should talk to him and elevate his worries.\"\nAlthough it was fleeting Cedric felt something was suspicious. But it was like a faint breeze passing by, he didn't think about it again.\n-----------**---------\nBack in the Academy, as Valerie said, exactly at seven fifteen Austin saw the warden heading toward the garden with her pet bird cradled in her arms.\nThe woman looked dangerous enough to make Austin hesitate since he knew getting caught meant another week in the infirmary.\nHowever, he held himself together and once she walked fairly away, he draped the shawl over his head to hide his identity and entered the dormitory.\nSince it was time for dinner, most of the students have gone to the cafeteria. Since tomorrow was the assessment, some of them were even practicing until now.\nAustin was also planning to do some late-night warm-up and train with Valerie tomorrow morning to have his limbs warmed up a bit.\nHowever, as of now, his focus is on reaching his fiancée.\nSilently walking through the corridors he followed the small map she gave him. It was adorable how she drew even a few plants and paintings on the map so he could know that he was on the right path.\n\"Come on, now!\"\nJust as he reached the floor where his destination awaited, he heard the voice of a few females approaching.\nAustin hurriedly climbed the stairs and waited for them to walk away.\nHiding at the corner, he was peeking at those passing girls when suddenly,\n*Tap*\nHis whole body turned still in shock as he asked, \"W-Who?\"\n\"Austin?\"\nAustin felt the voice was familiar and since the other personas identified him, he turned to look at her,\n\"Student Council President.\" He muttered upon seeing the raven-haired woman standing there.\nThe head of the council stood there with a surprised look on her face, \"What are you doing here?\"\nAustin looked uncertain, but before he could have said something,\n\"He is with me.\" A third voice interrupted them as they turned towards the violet-haired girl standing at the foot of the stairs.\nAustin smiled at his beloved, as Valerie stated, \"I have something to discuss with him, President.\"\nThe said President grinned, \"It must be quite important that the Disciplinary officer broke one of the biggest rule of the Academy and invited her fiancé here.\"\nThe serious expression of the violette was ruined by the subtle blush that appeared on her cheeks.\nDescending the stairs, the President paused before Valerie and said, \"Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.\"\nOnce she walked away, Valerie heaved a sigh and extended her hand toward her Lord, \"Let's go?\"\n---------**-------\nA/N:- I should increase the word count already.

      "content": "Chapter 36: Chapter 35- Date?\nIt was the first time for Austin to visit Valerie's room. It would be a lie to say that he was not nervous.\nAlthough he had entered a woman's room in his past life, with Valerie, it was different.\nHe didn't know why, but everything Valerie gave him a different feeling…although he had done several things in the past with different partners, with Valerie, he felt it was his first.\nJust like now, how he was hesitant to step inside the room where Valerie spends most of her time other than the classroom.\n\"Please come in,\" She said with a smile as they both stood before her room.\nWith a deep breath, he finally stepped inside—and was rendered speechless as he saw the scene awaiting inside.\nThe room was enshrouded in darkness and the only source of illumination was the candles on the cake resting over the table.\n\"It might not be great but I hope you like it…\" she nervously muttered as she found him staring at the cake with an unreadable expression on his face.\nShe didn't have much idea how people celebrate birthdays these days, so she made the same arrangement as her parents used to do back home.\nShe decorated the room with ribbons and prepared a few snacks…and a birthday cap.\n\"Val…you didn't have to trouble yourself so much…or that's what I would have said, but right now I am too happy to think about that…\"\nAustin was feeling a lump in his throat when he saw someone actually caring about his birthday to make so many arrangements.\nOn his birthdays he has always been alone, and his parents only send some money for him to celebrate.\nHowever, unlike other kids of his age, Austin actually liked it when someone celebrated his birthday; that's why he always bought a cake and cut it all alone in his room.\nEven in this life, he never felt people were celebrating his birthday since everyone remained always focused on Aiden.\nSo…indeed, seeing Valerie caring so much about his birthday…made him emotional.\nInching closer to her, he embraced the girl as he felt his eyes burning with tears,\n\"I cannot tell you how lucky I am to have you in my life. Thank you for not abandoning me, Val…\"\nValerie was slightly shocked but she soon calmed herself down and wrapped her hand around his back.\nResting her head on his shoulder she whispered, \"I am very thankful to have you in my life as well. And until death separates us, I promise to be by your side.\"\nThose words she always said in her mind previously, she was able to relay to the person today.\nThe duo remained hugging for another minute before Austin said, \"Now, let's cut the cake before the candles melt.\"\nValerie nodded with a smile, \"I will bring the knife.\"\nAs she walked away, Austin looked around the room and found that she had decorated the room quite well. And considering there was no shop around that sold these things, it must have been quite difficult for her.\nAustin then looked at the cake and nearly chuckled as he saw that she nearly wrote 'M' as for 'My Lord' but then changed the M for A and wrote his name instead.\n'Seriously, this girl…'\nValerie blushed when she saw her betrothed smiling while looking at the cake.\n\"L-Let's cut the cake…\" The blush on her cheeks was prettier than the design of the cake so Austin began looking at his beloved instead.\n\"Do I make a wish?\" He asked and found Valerie nodding her head vigorously,\n\"Yes, you should.\"\nAustin closed his eyes with a smile and blew the candles as he wished,\n'Whatever deity listens to my prayers, please bless our relationship.'\nOnce he opened his eyes, he found Valerie wearing the birthday cap and singing,\n\"Happy birthday, happy birthday; I wish you a very, very happy birthday.\"\nSeeing that adorable little cap and the way she swayed left to right, he chuckled.\nThe room was filled with happiness as the duo enjoyed each other's presence.\nFor them, not a third person was required. Not a grand celebration was needed. No fancy gift or grand feast was needed when they both had each other.\n….\nValerie had prepared some sweets and snacks, which they both enjoyed, along with the cake.\nAustin loved the cake because he liked the soft bread rather than the cream. And thankfully, Valerie added very little cream.\n\"I followed the recipe and it turned out well.\" Valerie smilingly told him as he continued to praise his fiancée.\nAlthough she made it sound so simple, looking at her burnt fingers, he could tell that she put a lot of effort into this.\n\"Hmm, let me see what you have gifted me,\" Austin said as he took the small box from nearby.\nValerie seemed slightly nervous; after all, this was the first time she had chosen a gift for him. Until now, it was her father and mother who brought gifts for Austin.\nAustin unwrapped the gift and was amazed to see a red and white scarf resting inside,\n\"Woah…this is unexpected.\"\nValerie, while rubbing her thumbs against each other, stated, \"It has been long since I knitted something…I hope you like it.\"\nAustin paused and looked at the girl with his brows raised, \"You knitted it?\"\nValerie slowly nodded, \"I wanted to give you something that I made…and since winters are approaching…\"\nThe first thing she thought was a blade to give him; however, considering Austin receives mostly weapons and artifacts during his birthdays, she wanted to give him something unique this time.\nSo she made some time after classes to knit the scarf.\nAustin wrapped the warm scarf around his neck as he muttered, \"I will treasure it. Thank you.\"\nAfter they finished cleaning up, Valerie took out the small container of the balm she talked about and asked Austin to fold his pants.\nAustin did as she asked, and sat down on the bed.\nValerie winced upon seeing the injury around his knee. It was still quite swollen, and the bone around the kneecap was still quite fragile.\n\"It won't heal the wound but surely would provide relief and strengthen your muscles.\"\nShe spoke as she knelt down on the floor, urging Austin to say, \"Sit on a chair.\"\nValerie shook her head, \"It's okay, and you shouldn't keep your leg straight for long.\"\nAustin yielded and offered his wound to her.\nValerie scooped some gel on her fingers before bringing it to his wounds.\n\"It may hurt a little.\"\nAustin nodded as he saw Valerie gently applying the gel to the affected area.\nHer slow movement and gentle care melted his heart as he just watched the girl in a daze.\nLooking at the girl closely, Austin couldn't help but feel that there was nothing in this girl that he didn't like. She was just…perfect.\n'Then why am I hesitating?'\nAfter thinking for a bit, Austin asked, \"Val, after tomorrow's assessment, will you go on a date with me?\"\nValerie was startled by the sudden proposal as she looked at him with her round eyes.\nHowever, seeing the plea in his gaze she couldn't remain silent for long before she answered him,\n\"I would love to.\"\n—-------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

So please, pay attention to your safety.\"\nAustin nodded, \"Yep, I know. And you don't need to worry, because of you and Val, I cannot let myself get any more injured.\"\nTaking a pause, and looking at his butler, Austin added with a thin smirk, \"But don't assume that I am going to fail this one. I am going to retain my position in the Apex Circle.\"\nSebastian was rendered speechless for a moment. The confidence in his eyes and the way he left no room for persuasion left the man helpless.\nIn the end, Sebastian could only hope that his young lord, succeed in his venture.\n—----**-----\nThe students 2-A were standing side by side near the rear entrance of the Academy.\nThey all were wearing similar uniforms. The top was a fitted jacket made of reinforced yet breathable fabric, tailored to allow a full range of motion. Its high collar provided protection against the elements, while multiple pockets were strategically placed for carrying tools and small supplies.\nThe trousers were sturdy and flexible, made from a lightweight yet tough material resistant to tears. Reinforced knee pads were built into the design, offering extra protection during treks through rough terrain.\nStudents were allowed to carry additional weapons, artifacts, and potions for this assessment.\nAustin was wearing a pair of steel knuckles since he knew his Soul Shard was unreliable.\nHe was standing on the extreme right while Valerie was on the extreme left.\nHe couldn't turn to look at her. That's why he was waiting for the opportunity to see his Princess in this attire.\n\"Okay now that you all have gathered and seem prepared, I would like to tell you a few rules you need to keep in mind during this assessment.\"\nThe instructor was a tall woman with long green hair and a pair of piercing violet eyes. Austin remembered her name to be Victoria.\nWith her left hand on her waist, the woman began, \"First, your goal: hunt monsters, the minimum limit is one, and the maximum is none. You have six hours in the forest so utilize your time wisely. Second, you cannot hunt your fellow classmates. Under any circumstances, you are not allowed to launch any attack which could harm your classmates. Third, if you feel your life is at risk or face any unexpected situation, use the spell [Regilia] or light up a torch provided to you.\"\nAustin checked the SOS torch which he had kept in his pocket. Since he couldn't chant a spell, this was his best option if something went awry.\n\"Fourth, this is an assessment to test your individual strength and brilliance on the battlefield. So helping out others would have your points deducted. Be careful about that,\" When she said that, the teacher turned her eyes between Valerie and Rhea alternatively.\nValerie remained nonchalant while Rhea awkwardly smiled.\nVictoria asked in a louder voice, \"Cadets, are you ready?!\"\n\"Yes, ma'am!\"\nThe woman nodded, \"Move out!\"\nAt once, every student dashed ahead, a huge cloud of dust erupting as they entered the forest.\nAustin was also like others, as he entered the forest, and after taking a few steps, he came to a halt.\n'Okay, let's see…' If he remembers correctly, the forest was densely populated with monsters on the north-west side. And currently, he was standing somewhere around the south-east.\nHis first goal was to hunt a beast as soon as he could so that when the real threat arrived, he would have enough points. After all, when 'that being' would make an appearance there was a high chance for the professors to end this assessment.\nSo before that, he would gain some experience of hunting. Well, forget about the points, the experience is what matters.\n'Okay, so the first step is…' He was just trying to try and sense the nearest beast when suddenly he felt something jumping towards him, urging Austin to sidestep, and barely dodge the beast.\n\"Fuck!\" He cursed as he saw a sabertooth tiger landing in the space where he once stood.\n'Brilliant…' Austin grinned as he got up on his feet and gripped his Soul Shard.\nThe manifestation of his soul glimmed with a deathly illumination as Austin stared at the seven-foot-long beast in the eye.\nAustin had retained the memories of the previous owner so he knows about the weak points of the beast.\nIts throat.\n*Grr*\nThe tiger growled, ready to lunge any moment as it moved in a circle and retained its gaze on its prey.\nAustin didn't flinch, his breathing steady despite the heavy tension in the air. His grip on the steel knuckles tightened, the glow of his Soul Shard pulsing faintly in sync with his heartbeat.\nThe sabertooth tiger growled low, its massive claws raking the dirt as it prowled in a circle. Its golden eyes locked on him, hungry and calculating.\n'It's stronger and faster. I can't face it head-on,' Austin thought, his mind racing. 'But its movements are predictable. It's a beast, not a tactician.'\nThe tiger lunged suddenly, a blur of muscles and sharp fangs. Austin dove to the side, feeling the air shift as claws swiped inches from his face. He rolled to his feet, heart pounding, and quickly scanned his surroundings.\nThe forest floor was littered with broken branches and uneven terrain. Perfect.\nAs the tiger spun around, ready for another attack, Austin kicked up a cloud of dirt into its face. The beast snarled, momentarily blinded, giving him just enough time to grab a thick branch from the ground.\nThe tiger roared, shaking its head clear, and leapt again. This time, Austin ducked low and swung the branch with all his strength, aiming for its exposed underbelly. The wood cracked on impact, making the beast howl in pain, but it wasn't enough to stop it.\nThe beast suddenly used its skill and dashed toward Austin with faster pace, leaving no room for him to dodge.\n\"Guh!\" Austin cried in pain as the tiger rammed its head into his chest, and threw the blond into the nearest tree.\nIt wasn't enough that the tiger pressed its massive paw against Austin's body to keep him pressed.\n\"*ROAAAAAAR*\" Already considering it its victory, the tiger roared, but then,\n**TREMBLE**\nAn aura that made the tiger tremble in fear, radiated from behind. The roar silenced up under the pressure as the beast felt its instincts shouting at it to run away.\n**SQUELCH**\nAustin took the advantage of the distraction and plunged his dagger into the tiger's vulnerable neck.\n\"*GRUOO*\" The beast growled in pain as it swayed its head left and right to release the grip. However, Austin clung to his dagger and while gritting his teeth, he stabbed the dagger deeper,\n\"HAAAAA!!!\" A loud cry of agony mixed with agitation echoed as Austin suddenly pushed the tiger back and got up on his feet\nThe tiger was bleeding profusely and was trying to get away, however, like shackles connecting them, Austin kept stabbing the dagger until the beast stopped moving around.\n\"*Gruff*\" The last groan of pain seeped through the dying beast throat, as Austin stated,\n\"I hope you attain peace in the afterlife.\"\nPraying for his first hunt, Austin began to pull out his dagger….only to find his eyes widening.\n\"What the heck…\" he continued to pull and pull but the Shard seemed like getting endlessly pulled out of the dead beast's body.\n\"Damn…\" the moment he took the whole dagger(?) out, he realised the reason why the beast died so easily.\nSubconsciously, Austin augmented his Shard and increased its size.\nBut before celebrating the achievement, he looked at the one who assisted him and waved at her, \"Thanks for that. See you later.\"\nHe received no response but he knew she was there.\nHis guardian angel. His dear Villainess.\n—------**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 38: Chapter 37- Catastrophe(1)\nIt was strange. First, Austin was able to detach his Soul Shard to make it a melee weapon against Parkinson and now he was able to Augment his Shard without even trying.\nWhat was this? A sudden change because Austin's soul was merged with someone who doesn't belong to this world?\nAs of now, Austin could only think of that being the reason responsible for this sudden change.\nHe was happy that he was progressing rapidly, more so when his goal was to participate in the tournament as an Elite, however, the sudden progression was happening without him realizing the method.\nSpontaneous changes can be lethal since you won't know how to trigger it and might not be able to use it when it is needed the most.\nFor now, Austin was traveling through the forest to find his next prey. The sabertooth would grant him at least five points, and to remain in the Apex Circle he needed five. But, just to ensure his position, he was searching for another beast worth even a single point.\n\"*HISSS*\"\nAustin paused as he heard the voice of a serpent nearby, the hair strands on his back standing erect.\nHe didn't make any restless move since a serpent only makes its presence obvious when its eyes are on the prey. It means Austin was on the radar.\nAustin released his Shard from the hand and before hitting the ground, it dissolved in the air.\nClosing his eyes, Austin felt his breath turning a little unsteady as he judged the position of himself and his prey. This was his second time coming across a real threat, and it would be a lie to say that he was not scared.\n'Keep calm...' Austin clenched his fists, his breaths grew steadier. The serpent's tail wrapped around his legs like a coiling noose. The slithering beast thought him trapped, but Austin's mind worked sharper than fear.\nWith a flick of his wrist, his Soul Shard materialized behind him, glowing with ethereal light.\n\"*HISSSSSS*\"\nThe serpent's hiss turned into a shrill scream as the weapon's sudden presence startled it. It reared back, fangs gleaming with venom, but Austin was already moving.\nHis boots slammed to the ground as he launched himself backward, narrowly escaping the snapping jaws.\nThe snake struck like a whip, its speed terrifying, but Austin was quicker. His shard met its attack mid-air, the collision releasing a sharp crack.\n'Agh ..it hurts...' Austin winced as his Shard was bitten by the beast; however, he soon recalled his Shard back in his hand and leaped into action.\nThe zigros snake hissed violently, its body undulating with rage. Austin wasted no time. His figure blurred as he charged, closing the distance in a blink. The snake lunged, its fangs aimed for his throat, but Austin pivoted, his shard slicing upward in one fluid motion.\nA streak of silver arced through the air, carving through the serpent's scaled armor. Its hiss faltered, replaced by the dull thud of its severed head hitting the ground.\nAustin stood still, panting lightly as the zigross's lifeless body collapsed in a heap. His shard, now dripping with the creature's venomous blood, faded into mist.\nCalming his breath, he heaved a sigh; he at least was living up to his rank as a D-rank warrior.\nHe still has the edge of an assassin even though he was a combatant in his last life.\n'I should get going and prepare-' His eyes turned blurry and a sudden rush of nausea made him kneel on the ground.\nA very terrifying presence, like a being straight forward abyss, had made an appearance in the forest. Austin was not able to control himself from throwing up as he felt his throat burning and his Soul Shard flickering.\nThe whole world seemed to be moving before his vision and he was just inches away from fainting.\n\"Austin!\" Valerie suddenly appeared out of nowhere to support her lover. She took out a potion and some water which Austin took and instantly gulped down.\nThis sensation was too grim and terrifying for him to resist. However, he had a feeling that fainting right now would result in something devastating.\n\"Val...what is this?\" His face was pale and sweat trickled down his head as he asked his fiancée.\nValerie had a frown on her face as she turned her face toward the north and said, \"I might be wrong...but this presence exceeds any being that should be present here.\"\nAustin was slightly confused...was the being whom Rhea had to face this terrifying? Wasn't it a bit too overpowered?\n\"We should get out of this forest and let the Instructor face the danger,\" Valerie said since her priority lies in Austin's safety.\nHowever, \"We cannot leave the forest.\" Austin muttered, as he got up on his feet and said, \"There is a forcefield around the forest. The instructors cannot enter the place.\"\nValerie frowned in confusion but before she could have asked anything, Austin stepped forward and summoned his Shard in his hand.\nCocking his hand back he threw the Shard with all his strength. The dagger flew towards the Academy in a high arc, however, just after traveling a few meters, it was struck against an invisible wall, stealing all the pace from the dagger.\nAustin told her, \"I felt it since I was nearest to the exit point. And now I understand why so many beasts were roaming around the border of the forest.\"\nValerie finished what he was about to say, \"They sensed the danger and were running away from it.\"\nAustin nodded; it wasn't like he didn't expect it, however, the presence of the A-rank beast was way above what he anticipated.\nValerie's eyes sharpened, her body rigid as the tremors in the air grew heavier. She stepped forward, her voice low but resonating with authority.\n\"Stay behind me.\"\nThe ground beneath her cracked as an invisible force erupted around her. Austin could feel the weight of her power pressing against his chest—it was suffocating yet awe-inspiring.\nValerie raised her hand, fingers curling as if gripping something unseen. The atmosphere around her spiraled violently, and a chilling wind howled through the forest.\nIn a heartbeat, the swirling air coalesced into a glowing spear, its shaft forged from shimmering light, and its tip gleaming with a razor-sharp edge. Frost spread outward from the spear, freezing the grass beneath her feet.\nHer grip tightened, and the spear pulsed with raw energy, sending sharp gusts of icy wind slicing through the trees. The temperature dropped, her presence turning into a force of nature.\nAustin couldn't compare his Shard with hers at all. The only student whose Shard has gone through three evolution.\nOne of the Seven tools of mass destruction: Shiverfall.\nValerie was about to launch the spear and shatter the barrier when suddenly her eyes widened as she hurriedly turned to her left before slamming her spear against the ground\n\"Val?!\" Austin exclaimed as suddenly huge spikes of ice erupted from the ground and trapped a being within the cage.\nValerie's eyes gave an ominous vibe as she stared at the huge monkey grinning from within the ice cage.\nAustin's eyes widened seeing the monster, as he muttered under his breath,\n'Isn't this an S-rank monster....why the fuck is it here?'\n---------**--------\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed the chapter.

      "content": "Chapter 39: Chapter 38- Catastrophe(2)\nThe plot has shifted somehow. The beast that was supposed to attack the students today was supposed to be an A-rank silver-horned rhino. Rhea would have to fight the beast being the third strongest of the class and someone who feels responsible for the safety of her classmate. And after a lot of struggle and a few flashbacks, she would have defeated the rhino.\nThen what happened so suddenly for this Illusion Monkey, which was an S-rank to appear all of a sudden?\n'Did Valerie's presence change something?' There is always the concept of the butterfly effect, and there is a saying that the world always tries to balance out forces to keep things in check.\nIn this world as well, the stronger a warrior becomes, the better the beasts would adapt and evolve.\nAs such, it would not be a far-fetched theory to say that the presence of an S-rank entity, Valerie, invited this disaster since an A-rank would have been a few swings of Valerie's spears, away from its demise.\n\"It's breaking...\" Austin muttered, and in the next instance he found himself getting embraced\nValerie didn't waste time before carrying her Lord and leaping through the forest to reach a safe distance.\nHer priority lies in keeping Austin safe, then only she could focus on defeating the monster.\nHowever, as she anticipated, how far she went she couldn't find herself reaching anywhere.\nHeaving a sigh, she paused, \"It has already expanded its illusion.\" Austin stated as he realized that although she jumped quite away, they still were a few meters away from the Monkey who was still inside the ice cage.\nValerie asked, \"Can you do me a favor and remain behind me? Please?\" The pleading in her gaze explained how much she was worried for him.\nHowever, \"Don't treat me like your weakness, Val. I won't slow you down so just fight to your heart's content.\"\nValerie was rendered momentarily speechless....was she being a bit too protective? Did it hurt his feelings? Agh, she is an idiot.\nTurning her attention back to the Monkey, Violette said, \"Back me up, my Lord; I might need your assistance soon.\"\nAustin smiled, \"Don't worry, I got your back.\"\nThe ice cracked and instantly, the Monkey jumped out of the prison, its hulking from heaving with rage to be contained within the prison.\nThe Illusion Monkey stood tall, its twisted body rippling with unnatural strength. Its dark, matted fur shimmered faintly, as though it were not fully real, blending into the air around it like a heatwave.\nIts glowing red eyes burned with malice, locking onto its prey with unsettling intelligence. A long, sinuous tail coiled and uncoiled, each movement brimming with tension, like a predator waiting to strike.\nBut the most horrifying part was its face—a grotesque mockery of human features, stretched into an eerie, distorted grin that radiated malice. As it moved, its form seemed to blur and shift, creating fleeting, ghostly replicas that vanished as quickly as they appeared, making it impossible to track.\nValerie's eyes glowed. She knew the weakness of this thing and that is its tail. Once you sever it, the Monkey would lose its vector and would be easy to hunt.\nHer spear glimmered with a deathly illumination as she held it behind her back, and with her left hand raised, she gestured for him to come.\nThe Monkey growled before it slammed its balled fist on the ground, making a dent in the surface before it lunged into action.\nJust as it launched forward, figure of the monkey blurred, and in the next instance, there were three replicas of the beast.\nAustin's eyes widened as he couldn't discern which was the real one. The movie's logic of tracing the shadow also didn't work since all three of them had the same dark shadow.\nValerie's legs tensed as she kept her eyes fixed on her target. She didn't budge from her place until the beast was a spear length away from her before she planted the butt of her Shard on the ground and sent a small shockwave toward the incoming monkeys, making all three of them flicker.\nValerie smirked before she simply stabbed her spear above her head—erasing all the illusions as the beast was caught amidst his attempt to hurt the prey.\nHowever, Valerie failed to stab it; rather, the monkey grabbed her spear and leaped back, trying to snatch the Shard from her.\nValerie narrowed her eyes and summoned the Shiverfall in her other hand; twirling on her feet, she swung the spear with death precision, trying to beside the monkey's neck.\nThe Illusion Monkey growled, its crimson eyes blazing under the harsh sunlight as it lunged at Valerie. She braced herself, her Shiverfall gleaming like ice in the noonday sun, and met its charge with a vicious upward slash. The spear's edge bit into the Monkey's shoulder, tearing through fur and muscle, but the beast roared and struck back.\nIts clawed hand raked across her ribs, ripping through her leather armor and drawing blood.\nAustin gritted his teeth but he couldn't find any opening to support his beloved.\nValerie clenched her fist and leaped back, hurling her spear with deadly precision.\nThe Illusion Monkey snarled and reached out to catch it, but the moment Shiverfall touched its hand, it dissolved into mist. Frost exploded over the beast's arm, encasing it in thick ice.\n\"Gruooogh!\" The Monkey roared, thrashing against the numbing cold, but it didn't notice Valerie above.\nUsing a sturdy branch as her springboard, she launched herself toward her prey with terrifying speed. The branch snapped under the force of her leap, shards of wood scattering as she descended like a thunderbolt, her eyes locked on the beast's exposed flank.\nCocking her fist, Valerie's muscles tensed like coiled steel before she drove her punch into the Monkey's forehead with devastating force.\nCRACK!\nThe sound of bone fracturing echoed like thunder as the colossal beast—ten feet tall—was lifted off its feet and hurled through the air.\nBOOOOOOOM!\nIt slammed into the ground with earth-shattering force, creating a crater as the impact sent shockwaves rippling through the forest. Dust and debris exploded outward, silencing everything in its wake.\nAustin watched, breathless, as his fiancée stood above the destruction, her fist still clenched, her expression cold and unyielding.\n'Man...she is so cool.'\n----------**--------\nA/N:- If you are wondering if Austin is always going to remain on the sidelines, then no, Austin is the main character, so surely he will grow.

We need to take care of the danger before anyone could get harmed.\"\nRudolph clicked his tongue; this girl was always so hot-headed.\n\"Listen, why do you think there has been no interference from the instructors until now?\" The taller one interrupted Rhea, much to the latter's annoyance.\n\"What do you mean? Just say it!\" She couldn't waste her time here, and let her classmates get harmed. She knew Valerie would be able to handle the situation so Rhea must help the others to evacuate.\nHowever, Rudolph's following words made her frown in confusion, \"Can't you feel it? The sudden magical field surrounding us—it's a barrier; I have sensed and attempted to exit the forest. But as I thought, there is indeed someone who chanted this barrier to keep us within the forest.\"\nRhea asked, \"Then shouldn't teachers have already sensed the situation and tried to break the barrier?\"\nRudolph shook his head, \"I don't know but there is nothing they are doing. As such, the first thing we should do is to take care of the barrier, or the students won't be able to evacuate.\"\nRhea clenched her fist, as she said, \"Then go and search for that chanter while I look for the beast.\"\n\"But Valer-\"\n\"I don't think she can do it all on her own,\" Rhea added, and in the next instance, a pink blur weaved through the forest.\nRudolph remained standing there for a few seconds before he heaved a sigh turned toward his left. As he dashed forward, a few words escaped his lips,\n'Let's find this fucker first...'\n-------**------\nIllusion Monkey is an S-rank beast that was born with the ability to create illusions, divert the attention of its prey, and lure them into its trap. These kinds of beasts, which possess intelligence, generally love to play with their target before devouring them.\nThe beast Valerie was facing at the moment was no bigger than a teenager, in their terms; as such, although it would be easier to deal with it considering the lack of experience, Valerie needed to counter the short temper of the beast as well.\nJust like how a single punch it all took and the Beast already bubbling with anger, the aura of the inhumane making the ground tremble and steam erupting from its body.\nValerie had her eyes trained on the beast; her Shard held firmly in her hand as she awaited its next move.\nShe could tell that there were no beasts around, thankfully, because of the presence of this hulking monster.\n**THUMP** **THUMP**\nThe beast slammed its fist on its bulging cheats before it lunged into action.\nValerie frowned upon seeing that the beast was not creating any mirage anymore rather charging head on.\nValerie leaped from her position, her spear slicing through the air with a sharp whistle. Her aim was true, the spearheaded straight for the monkey's chest—\nUntil it wasn't.\nAt the last moment, the Illusion Monkey vanished, leaving behind a faint shimmer where it once stood. Valerie's spear struck empty air, embedding itself into the ground with a resounding thud.\nHer instincts screamed too late.\nThe beast reappeared at her side, its fist already in motion.\nBAM!\nValerie's body flew like a ragdoll, crashing through a cluster of trees. She winced as she landed hard on her side, her grip still tight on her Shard.\n\"Damn it!\" she spat, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth. She forced herself to her feet, her eyes blazing with determination.\nThe monkey was on the move again, its body a blur of speed and malice.\nValerie slammed her Shard into the ground, summoning a wave of jagged ice that erupted like spears from the earth. The air chilled instantly, her ice magic surging with lethal intent.\nBut the beast was already gone, leaving only afterimages in its wake.\n\"Stay still, you monkey!\" Valerie roared. She thrust her hand forward, and a torrent of frost shot out, the air crackling as the freezing spell expanded outward.\n**THUD**\nSuddenly, she heard the sound of two forces clashing from behind, urging the girl to twirl on her feet and witness her Lord protecting her, using his elongated Shard as a shield.\n\"A-Austin?\" She was too startled to respond to his call immediately. But soon her ears picked,\n\"ABOVE!\"\nHer body moved on instincts as she stabbed her spear above her head, and this time, it definitely connected.\n**SQUELCH**\nThe Monkey growled as it found its blood freezing by the effect of the weapon.\nValerie gritted her teeth and enlarged her spear.\n\"*GRUOOOEEGH*\" The monkey cried in agony as the whole spear went through its stomach, penetrating from its back.\nHowever, then, much to her shock, the Monkey turned into mist, and the being that appeared from behind the mist was...\n\"...Rhea?\" Her eyes widened as she found that the monkey had tricked her and she ended up stabbing Rhea.\n\"khuk!\" Austin groaned as the monkey he was facing was the real one...\n....and the beast ended up breaking Auatin's Shard.\n---------**--------\nA/N:- If you didn't understand, Rhea jumped to help Austin, but the Monkey used its Illusion, and then you can follow.

      "content": "Chapter 41: Chapter 40- Catastrophe(End)\nOne of the Seven Tools of Destruction, a title given to Shiverfall, born when Valerie pushed her Shard beyond what any mortal should ever achieve.\nA skill that defies all comprehensibility and goes beyond any rankings. There are numerous ice users, but none could be compared to the one who cannot only freeze the physical world but influence the soul of a being.\nHaving the ability to freeze time for eternity around a certain region was the mechanism of Stasis.\nIn the original timeline, Valerie used it after a lot of research and deliberate practice. However, in this life, the agitation she felt upon seeing the Shard of her beloved getting snapped...his Soul receiving the damage, forced her body and Soul to reveal her Godly side.\n....\nThe air around Valerie turned heavy, an unnatural stillness spreading outward. Her eyes, cold and devoid of emotion, locked onto the Illusion Monkey.\nThe beast hesitated, its instincts screaming danger. Its illusions flickered erratically, unable to take form. It screeched, panic rising as if sensing an inescapable doom.\nValerie raised her Shard, her movements deliberate yet unnervingly calm. The temperature plummeted, frost creeping along the ground, crackling like brittle glass.\nThe monkey lunged, desperate to escape, but its body froze mid-motion. Time itself seemed to grind to a halt, the beast's limbs suspended in the air, its terrified eyes wide and unblinking.\nAustin, who was helping Rhea to stop her bleeding, had his eyes widened as he looked at the girl.\nThe mark of a snowflake spread across the whole forest, marking the wilderness within her range of influence as the Monkey was left nowhere to run.\nWithout a word, Valerie raised her hand. A circle of radiant frost formed beneath the monkey, spiraling upward with glacial precision. The light within the frost burned brighter, an aurora of gold and white that was beautiful yet suffocating, like the gaze of an unforgiving deity.\nThe monkey's body contorted, frozen mid-scream as the frost encased it. Time itself bent around the creature, its movements slowing to an agonizing crawl until nothing remained but silence.\nThe frost reached its apex, encasing the beast entirely. A sharp crack split the air as the icy sculpture glowed brilliantly for one horrifying moment—then shattered into a million sparkling fragments, scattering like divine judgment.\nThere was no resistance since the S-rank beast was never allowed to retaliate against the immortal strength of the being who was supposed to become one of the strongest entities that could rival demigods.\nAustin watched her in astonishment and admiration as Valerie ended the Catastrophe in just a few seconds.\n'The power that can make even a God envy...damn...she is strong.' Austin was brought back to his senses as Valerie knelt before him, and asked,\n\"Do you feel alright, my lord? It doesn't hurt anywhere, right? I will bring you to the church right away-\" However, her words were interrupted,\n\"I...am dying...here...\" Rhea groaned, unable to believe that she was being ignored even in her final moments.\nValerie narrowed her eyes and took out a potion. It was glowing with a cyan shade which she instantly poured over Rhea's wound and said, \"You will be fine now.\"\nRhea indeed felt better as the warm liquid seeped inside her wounds, and healed her damaged organs. If not for her being awakened, the wound she received might have taken her life by now.\n\"Thanks...\" Rhea muttered, \"...well, you injured me so I guess there is no need to thank you.\"\nValerie remained silent, however, she was frustrated to see the girl resting her head on her beloved's thigh.\nAustin, who was unaware of the reason behind her displeasure, said, \"It's okay now, Val, you have defeated the foe.\"\nA soft smile bloomed on her face, as Valerie said, \"We defeated it...Austin. You protected me at that time, or I might have lost.\"\nAlthough Austin knew that Valerie would have been fine even if she had taken that hit, he didn't say anything to correct her. It was a part of her, to appreciate his little efforts.\nHowever, even though Austin wasn't able to do much during the battle, he learned several things watching the two powerhouses fight.\nHe has a long way to go, and fortunately, he has someone who can guide him on that path.\n**SHATTER**\nEveryone turned their eyes toward the sky as fragments of the barrier fell but disintegrated into nothingness before hitting the tree.\n\"The barrier seems to be lifted...\" Austin muttered. He was aware of who chanted that barrier and planned on harming the students today.\n'It's time to bring that man into light...'\n-------**------\nThe students were evacuated and were carried to the infirmary. Since there were not many beds, various students were getting treated in their rooms.\nThankfully, there was enough supply and infirmary staff to handle the situation. And upon the call from the Headmaster, the church workers also arrived to help Austin rebuild his Shard.\nLaying on his bed, Austin was recovering just like any other student, and beside his bed was the familiar grey-haired butler.\n\"I feel so useless these days, my Lord...\"\nHearing the man sigh and looking older than his age, Austin felt bad, \"It wasn't like you purposely chose to not protect me.\"\nSebastian didn't say anything but he still was quite disheartened to find his Young Master getting injured so regularly these days.\nWhile Austin munched on the diced apples, Sebastian gave him, he asked, \"What happened, Sebas? Why wasn't there any interference from the teachers?\"\nSebastian continued to apply cooling ointment to his master's wound as he said, \"For the initial few moments, no one noticed any chances, including me. However, the moment I realized the excessive serenity of the surroundings, I knew something was suspicion.\"\n\"Then? Did you try to break the barrier?\" Austin was aware of the person behind this barrier, but how they prevented the others from damaging the spell from the outside was not within his knowledge.\nSebastian explained, \"It was an ancient spell that witches used to utilize at the time of war between civilizations. Since Witches have always been secluded beings, who did not ever want to meddle with others' businesses, they always chanted these kinds of barriers around their town, which prevented any outside forces from disturbing them.\"\nTaking a pause, he added, \"The distinctive feature of this kind of barrier is that the more one tries to break it from the outside, the stronger the barrier gets.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"Were witches peace-loving creatures.\"\nSebastian smiled, a mocking one it seemed, as he said, \"If you anger a witch, or harm someone close to them, even if that thing is trivial in your eyes, then there could be nothing more dangerous than a Witch. They are one vengeful creature.\"\nAustin was surprised to hear that, as he asked, \"Are there still witches around?\"\nSebastian nodded, \"Witches can travel through space and time, and they age extremely slowly, compared to us humans. Some say that witches are nothing but myth. But I believe that they are still around.\"\n----------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 42: Chapter 41- Council\nValerie was summoned by the Headmaster in his office, to report about the incident that transpired in the forest during the assessment.\nThere was a reason why she was called here alone, and that reason was, \"You used an Ex-rank spell that defies the laws of this world. Are you aware?\"\nValerie knew what Philius was talking about. And she also knows who reported it to him.\nRhea.\nHowever, it was not like she could have hidden something so massive and devastating from the authorities for a long time, so she just answered truthfully, \"I am aware, Headmaster.\"\nPhilius leaned forward and asked, \"And do you know what my duty is as a Headmaster here?\"\nValerie was aware but she didn't say anything; urging the man to utter,\n\"Anyone who possesses the strength that is wasted in the field they are currently engaged in, then the administrator or head of that field, must report about the entity to the Council.\"\nPhilius added, \"The Council has already asked for your inclusion in the training camp. However, since you had the support of your father and you showed reluctance to join the ranks, we never forced you.\"\nValerie was aware, she was told by her father. However, her reluctance arose from the fact that after joining the Council she wouldn't be able to meet her Lord regularly.\nPhilius heaved a sigh, \"If you had agreed, you would have been the youngest pillar. However, let's not talk about it, for now.\"\nWith his gaze redirecting towards Valerie, Philius asked, \"But now...things are different. If the Council gets to know about the fact that you have surpassed the S-rank, not even I could save you from being taken away.\"\nThe Council did not belong to a single nation but was a Union formed by the leaders of the seven major nations of the human side. As such, no authority could go against the decision the Council takes.\nConsidering the importance of the Council and the things they are responsible for, naturally, they would need to have strong warriors in possession in case the Dark Side decides to attack them.\nAll the five warriors, who have surpassed S-rank in the past are now known as the Supreme Pillars of Defense. And Valerie would be the sixth.\nHowever, \"I don't want to go, Headmaster.\"\nPhilius heaved a sigh; he expected as much.\nHe was aware of Valerie's affection towards Austin and to what length Valerie could go if someone dared to detach them.\nAnd considering Austin's current situation with his family, there should be someone around that boy who can take care of him.\nPhilius rested his arms on the table and stated, \"Look, Valerie, by not telling the Council, I would be betraying humanity. After all, if something were to happen, and you can't be there on time to save others, I would be accountable for that.\"\nThe violet-haired girl remained silent, waiting for him to continue.\nPhilius added, \"That's why I cannot allow you to continue being a student of the Academy, until graduation.\"\nValerie frowned, but before she could have said anything, the Supreme Authority said,\n\"Until the coronation next year, you can stay by Austin's side. However, after that, I cannot allow you to stay away from the Council.\"\n\"But, Headmaster-\"\n\"That's the final decision, Valerie. That's all I could do for you, without getting myself crushed under the guilt of betraying the Council.\"\nValerie clenched her fist behind her back, before she said, \"...understood.\"\nThere was nothing she could say to convince him, however, she was reluctant to part ways with her Lord.\nThen...what she could do to remove herself from the possible recruitment as a Pillar?\nIt wasn't like Philips couldn't sense that the girl was still resistant to leaving Austin behind, but he chose to not talk about it anymore, rather, he warned her,\n\"If you don't want yourself to get forced into recruitment, don't use your Ex-rank skill during the tournament. After all, as of now, only Austin and Rhea know about it other than me....but during the tournament, there would be thousands of eyes watching you.\"\nValerie gave a firm nod, \"Understood.\"\n--------**--------\n\"Are you sure you don't want me to bring you food?\" Rhea's friend, Cassie, asked her as she sat beside the pinkhead.\nRhea hadn't recovered, and there were still bandages around her stomach. Although the potion—it was of the highest grade—healed her internal organs and stopped her from bleeding, there was still damage dealt to her internal parts that needed some time to heal.\nShaking her head, she said, \"I am fine, and can go out to have a meal.\" Rhea assured her. She felt bad to have someone taking care of her.\nAlthough it was an emergency, Rhea didn't like to waste others' time taking care of her.\n*Knock*\nHearing the knock, the two ladies turned towards the door, before Cassie got up to check who it was.\n\"Coming...ah!\" She was startled to find the unexpected face waiting on the other end.\n\"V-V-Valerie?\" Cassie was startled to find the violette standing there.\n\"Valerie?\" Rhea was surprised as well, as she called out, \"Let her in, Cassie.\"\nThe short brown-haired girl panicked before she hurriedly sidestepped and invited the Disciplinary officer inside.\nValerie stepped in before standing before Cassie and stating, \"I will be here for the time being; you can go and have lunch.\"\nCassie was taken aback by the sudden suggestion(?). She glanced at Rhea, and upon finding her nodding in assent, Cassie said,\n\"Then, excuse me.\"\nOnce the third person walked out, Valerie closed the door and approached Rhea.\nThe atmosphere of the room suddenly turned heavy as Valerie took the seat beside the bed.\nThere was a dry smile on Rhea's lips, as she asked, \"Why do you never smile if Austin is not around?\"\nBecause he is the only reason, why I smile—Valerie inwardly muttered.\nOnce she sat down, Valerie asked, \"Did you tell the Headmaster about what happened back then?\"\nRhea was slightly nervous being asked about it, but she chose to remain honest, \"Yes, I told him everything.\"\nValerie suddenly pulled out a rectangular parchment, in which ancient language was inscribed.\n\"You know what this is?\" Valerie asked.\nRhea frowned upon looking at it closely as she muttered, \"Oathseal.\"\nValerie nodded, \"I want you to take an oath, that you won't tell anyone about what happened that day.\"\nRhea was expecting it, yet it didn't stop her from feeling surprised as she asked, \"And what are you going to promise me in exchange?\"\nWithout hesitation, Valerie stated, \"After graduation, my father will hire you.\"\nRhea grinned. There was no point in hesitating. Being recruited by the Duke to serve in the military? Well, what can she ask for more?\n\"Deal.\"\n--------**-------\nA/N:- Rhea is one straightforward girl.

      "content": "Chapter 43: Chapter 42- The reason\nWhat was there to change and improve?\nFirst was Austin's reaction to the sudden emergence of the Monkey. If not for Valerie being present around him, that late reaction would have been his death.\nAustin was new to these dangers. All he has fought in his previous life was humans. Those fights were always predictable and never had been life-threatening—except for those MMA battles he fought after his first breakup.\nHis strength was growing and so was his Shard, however, he has to choose his enemies and fight those foes whom he can actually defeat. There are about seventy days left before the beginning of the contest; as such, he has to improve fast.\n*Knock*\nHearing the knock on his window, he didn't have to look at the person to know who it was. However, who can resist looking at such a lovely face?\nTurning his eyes toward the person, Austin said, \"It's open, come in.\"\nValerie shyly lifted the window, before she jumped inside the room.\nConsidering Austin was forbidden from moving around, Valerie had no option but to show her unladylike side again.\nShe feels so ashamed yet excited at the same time!\n\"Are you okay?\" She asked as she inched closer to him and revealed the thermos she brought with her.\nBringing a bowl near, she poured the soup she brewed back into her room before serving it to Austin, \"Vegetable soup. Since the healer said that you should have easy-to-digest food, I have added very little meat.\"\nValerie offered the bowl as Austin rested his back against the headboard.\n\"It smells so good...did you make it?\" Austin asked, an excited smile on his face.\nValerie smiled and nodded. Seeing his smile alone allowed her to forget about all the stress she had.\nAustin scooped some hot soup and drank it.\n\"It's quite well balanced, Val. Did you add tomato in it?\"\nThe girl nodded, \"I thought it would be too spicy, so I just added tomato paste near the end. It's...not unpleasant right?\"\n\"Are you kidding? I have never had something better than this?\"\nAlthough she knew that he was exaggerating, she couldn't stop herself from feeling elated. Being praised by the man she loves hits differently.\nWhile Austin enjoyed the soup, he asked, \"Do you not have to rest? I mean you got hit twice by that monster.\"\nAustin has witnessed how strong that Monkey was; those punches Valerie faced were quite devastating and had enough force to crush a lower-ranked hunter's bones to dust.\nValerie heaved a sigh, \"Look at you, my Lord...you had your Shard damaged yet you are worrying about me.\"\nValerie knows the pain of having one's Shard damaged since, in the past, in desperation, she also had her Spear cracked.\nIt feels like one is sucking your life force at a rapid pace, and the pain is equivalent to how one feels thousands of invisible needles stab at your spirit, leaving behind a relentless ache that doesn't fade.\nThe pain reverberates through your very being, as if every corner of your soul is crying out in anguish. The pain isn't just physical; it feels like your memories, identity, and emotions are unraveling, leaving you hollow and incomplete.\nDespite that pain, Austin kept a bold front in front of Valerie, however, she heard his cries when she left.\nHer body shook, and her heart wrenched in great pain, hearing his cries of agony. She still hasn't forgiven herself for letting her Lord face such pain because of her.\n\"You are blaming yourself and making me feel guilty.\" Austin suddenly muttered, his eyes drawn to the soup and a sad smile extending his lips.\nValerie's eyes widened as she said, \"I-I am not blaming-\"\n\"Who are you lying to, Val? I can read you like an open book, and can tell that you are blaming yourself for what I faced.\" Tilting his head and after holding her hand softly, he asked,\n\"Then shouldn't I blame myself for being so pathetically weak, as well?\"\n\"No! You are-\" She paused, realizing that saying anything would make it worse.\nShe first calmed herself down and held his hand back.\nAustin gave her the time to collect her thoughts before he heard the girl uttering, \"Please forgive me...I shouldn't feel like this, but every time I see you hurt, I feel myself responsible. I feel so frustrated with everything that hurts you...that I just lose my cool every time.\"\nLying to her betrothed was not a good thing, so she just confessed whatever she felt.\nAustin smiled at the girl. She is so lovely, so pure that he feels himself unworthy of her fondness sometimes.\nCupping her cheek, he said, \"The real reason why I jumped in was not only because I wanted to protect you, but there was another motive. Do you know what?\"\nValerie looked at him questioningly.\nAustin's eyes turned cold for a moment, as he confessed, \"I just wanted somehow to hurt that beast...see its blood somehow....since the being who hurts you deserves nothing less than death.\"\nA sudden rush of warmth made her face hot, upon seeing her Lord being so protective of her.\nThe murderous intent he radiated, the way his grip turned firm, and how his whole presence shouted danger, made the girl tear up.\nAnd it wasn't just her eyes that turned moist.\nRubbing his thumb softly on her cheek, he added, \"So it's not just you who thinks that way.\"\n\"My Lord...\" She leaned her face in his hold, feeling his body heat, warming up her whole body.\n....\nAfter a few minutes, Austin finished the soup and they were now able to talk casually, given Austin removed a very heavy burden from her shoulders.\nThey were still holding hands, as Valerie asked, \"Are you resuming your training from tomorrow?\"\n\"Undoubtedly. I think I now can control the Augmentation of my Shard.\"\nValerie raised her brows, \"I was really surprised to see the size of your Shard increasing. It's quite an improvement in a very short duration.\"\nAustin smiled in glee, \"You think? Well, it must be the training you provided with.\"\nValerie shook her head, \"It's not that, Austin, it's the dedication and intention you hold to improve that has affected your Shard.\"\nAustin was surprised, \"Does Soul Shard react to a person's emotions?\" There was no evidence of it in books so he wasn't sure.\nHowever, \"I always feel that Shards react to their wielder's thought process. That's why I was able to utilize that Ex-rank spell-\" Valerie suddenly paused, as she recalled the discussion she had with the Principal.\nAustin raised his brows, \"Did something happen?\" He has forgotten things relating to Council that's why he was genuinely confused by the sudden shift of her temperament.\nValerie hesitated for a moment, but then decided to reveal everything to her beloved, \"I...was summoned by the Headmaster yesterday...\"\nShe then told him everything that happened back in the office. The decision he made and the fact that she would have to work for the Council after the coronation next year.\nAustin scoffed, \"He said until coronation because the Headmaster knows that I will get attacked before that.\"\nValerie's brows drew closer in a frown, \"What do you mean?\"\nAustin trusted this woman, so he didn't hesitate to reveal, \"He isn't like how the world perceives him. My brother is a very cunning and selfish person. The slight chances I have to inherit the throne, he would try to eliminate those chances by either crippling me or worse, killing me.\"\nThe air around the two turned frosty. It wasn't that Valerie never suspected the elder brother of her beloved, but to think Aiden would be such a bastard(she trusts Austin's words blindly).\nAustin smiled at his girl and said, \"The Headmaster must be fearing that as well; that's why he is allowing you to remain by my side to protect me until coronation.\"\nValerie now understood the situation. Although she could risk her life to protect her beloved, she doesn't know if the risk would lessen even after the coronation.\n\"Austin...should we run away and start a new life somewhere far away?\" She was a little frustrated by all the complications rising, and there was a slight desperation to just have a quiet life with her Lord that urged her to say that.\nFor a moment, Austin just wanted to say yes. After all, he never desired wealth or power. He just wanted to lead a peaceful life with the one he adores. However, considering the future, he couldn't just run away, or God knows what the protagonist might end up doing in front of the final threat. Worse, she might die before fighting the Demon Lord.\nCupping her cheeks, Austin assured her, \"Although it sounds tempting, parting ways from our families would hurt them as well.\" Valerie didn't look up, feeling a little wronged that her Lord didn't want to start a new life with her. Although she knew what he was saying was right and practical, she couldn't stop herself from feeling like this.\nSeeing that slight bulge of her cheek, Austin could not stop himself from chuckling as he asked, \"Okay, I have angered my fiancée. What can I do to compensate?\"\nValerie flinched, but then, while controlling her excitement(barely), she said, \"A-A date?\"\n--------**-------\nA/N:- Damn, she is so cute and easy to please.

      "content": "Chapter 44: Chapter 43- Date\nAustin promised a date to his fiancée so it was her right to demand a date.\nSince it was only afternoon and from tomorrow, they had to continue their training and classes, Valerie and Austin decided to visit the market today and just walk around a bit.\nAustin had planned something else…to bring her to a special place and spend some quality time with his beloved. However, his lover was worried about him traveling far away, so they decided to just visit the market near the Academy.\n\"Aren't you disappointed though? Every girl has so many dreams and plans for their first date, yet you are going on a bland shopping trip with me.\" Austin asked as they boarded the carriage and rode towards their destination.\nValerie smiled softly as she told him, \"When it comes to dating, it's just about spending time with the person you like. And currently, I am doing the same.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Upgrade your demands, Val, or I might become nonchalant in our relationship.\"\nThe other one chuckled, her voice sounding like a melodious rhythm, before she said, \"I will try to do that, my Lord.\"\n….\nSoon their carriage came to a halt at the entrance of the market.\nAustin hopped off and offered his hand to the lady.\n\"Thank you,\" She voiced before Austin asked,\n\"Is there any specific place you want to visit?\"\nValerie looked contemplative, \"I don't know much about the stores present here. Let's look around first?\" She suggested.\n\"Let's go then,\" He offered his hand, for her to hold.\nValerie's cheeks turned a little hot; this was not the first time for them to hold hands, yet every time she felt shy being so intimately close to her Lord.\n\"L-Let's go.\"\n….\nThe market near the Academy was quite big, however, not very crowded. During the tournament or enrollment seasons, this market remains quite busy.\nAnd since a tournament is about to start in two months, new stores are being established around the market.\nThe first place he brought the girl was an accessory shop, situated not so far away from the entrance.\nSince they were wearing the uniform of the academy, the shopkeeper was extra polite, \"What would the lovely couple like to see?\"\nValerie and Austin ignored the shopkeeper and continued to look at the things on display.\nThe brunette was stumped at her place after being ignored by the two teenagers.\nAustin picked a bracelet, thin metal bracelet that would look good both on males and females.\n\"That's a very wonderful artifact for a couple, \" The lady began, \"There is a feature of that artifact that allows you to track the other pair if commanded.\"\nAustin was surprised, \"How does that work?\"\nThe shopkeeper finally felt a little useful as she relayed, \"Just feed a droplet of your blood to the bracelet you would be giving your partner. And when you want to track them, just whisper 'Find me' into the artifact, and you will be guided to them.\"\nValerie frowned, \"Isn't this an A-rank tracking device? Do you have a permit to sell it so openly?\"\nThe seller was flustered upon hearing that, as she hurriedly added, \"I-It can only detect its other half within five hundred meters of range, so it's not an A-grade.\"\nValerie's eyes were still cold, \"Still this is a tool that can be used by the military. Have you gained the consent to sell it to the general masses?\"\nThe brunette was now sweating profusely; not good; this little girl was too well-informed!\nMuch to her relief, Austin jumped in, \"Aren't we lucky to have found something so highly useful without needing to request the military? I mean with this, we can track each other's location in case of an emergency.\"\nThe frost around the lavender-tressed receded as she softly muttered, \"If you say so...\"\nAustin paid for the artifact, even though the shopkeeper was reluctant—given she feared Valerie informing the authorities about the shop—before they left the shop.\nAfter walking a few steps, Valerie couldn't help but ask, \"Do you think I am a troublesome woman?\"\nAustin was surprised, \"Why would you say something like that?\"\n\"I mean...I always remain so upright that many people say that it's a bother to hang around me.\"\nAustin scoffed, \"Then they are blind or just foolish. Your company is the best. If I have to choose two people to spend my entire life with, I will choose you twice.\"\n\"⁄⁠•⁠⁄⁠-⁠⁄⁠•⁠⁄\" Valerie lowered her face, as she felt shy like never before.\nHer Lord is so good to her.\nThe next place they visited was a dessert shop from where Austin picked two drinks,\n\"Are you sure you don't want any sugar?\" The shopkeeper asked, with a surprised expression.\nThis was a dessert shop, a place for sweet lovers, yet the boy was asking not to add any sugar to the hot chocolate.\n\"Yes, please,\" Austin responded positively before he paid for the drinks and brought them back to Valerie, who was sitting on the bench near the fountain.\n\"Here you go.\" Handing her the hot chocolate, he also sat down and began sipping on his smoothie.\nYup, tastes great.\nValerie hesitantly sipped the drink and was pleasantly surprised to find only bitterness awaiting her.\nShe turned toward her beloved before asking, \"You knew?\"\nWhile side-glancing at the girl, Austin asked, \"Did you think, you are the only one observing the one you love?\"\nValerie smiled, as she leaned her on his shoulder before whispering, \"It makes me happy...thank you.\"\nThe duo then sat there and chatted about leisurely things. No stress of the tournament, no regret of the past, and no fear of the future.\nThey just enjoyed the moment and each other's presence. And that was all they could have ever asked for.\n....\n\"Val, let's have some tea.\" It was getting dark and Valerie thought they would be returning to the academy now when suddenly her beloved suggested.\nValerie raised her brows before she asked, \"Should we get back and have tea in the cafeteria?\"\nAustin smiled at her, \"I think we will get something more than a beverage there.\"\nValerie was surprised to hear that, but since her Lord insisted, she didn't say anything against that and obediently followed him.\n*Tring*\nIt was a small eatery with not many people sitting around.\nHowever, those who were seated, couldn't resist the urge to look at the two individuals who just walked in.\n\"Are they...royalties\"\n\"They have to be...\"\n\"They look so good together.\"\n\"A warm boy and a cold girl, haa. What a dreamy couple.\"\nIgnoring their comments, Valerie and Austin made their way to the counter and sat down side by side.\nThere was a white-haired man wiping the glass on the other side, who asked, \"What would you like to have, sir?\"\n\"A cup of herbal tea with no milk and two cubes of sugar.\" Hearing his words, the bartender looked up from the glass and glanced at Austin for a moment.\nHe rested the glass on the counter, before saying, \"Wait a moment, sir.\"\nAustin grinned; it worked.\nHe took out a small parchment which he was carrying and dropped it in the glass.\nValerie raised her brows seeing her Lord suddenly resting the paper there, but she didn't ask him right away.\nThe man soon came with a hot cup of tea resting on the tray.\nHe rested the tray on the counter before taking the glass with him.\nAustin asked, \"You want to ask me something?\"\nValerie didn't wait to ask, \"What was written in that parchment?\"\nAustin sipped the tea, a sigh of admiration seeping through his lips, as he responded, \"Just an inquiry. I heard this place is quite useful to those who seek information.\"\nValerie asked, \"And what did you ask for?\"\nAustin was about to respond when suddenly the same glass appeared on the counter.\nAustin retrieved the parchment, before urging, \"Let's go. We will talk in the carriage.\" After paying for the tea, Austin led Valerie out of the place and wordlessly, they headed towards the carriage.\nAustin finally unfolded the parchment, and read the content.\nValerie also read the letters,\n[Three men have infiltrated the Academy. Possibly, demonic humans.]\n\"...!!!\" Valerie's eyes widened as she asked, \"Is this informant reliable?\"\n\"Sebastian trusts him, so yeah.\"\nValerie suggested, \"Then should we inform the Headmaster?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"They are capable enough to infiltrate the academy, so surely they must have an escape plan as well. We cannot move recklessly or they might prepone their plan.\"\nValerie was restless, \"Then...what should we do?\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Give me some time to think. For now, don't let your guard down around anyone. And whenever we meet, we need to confirm a code to know that it's us.\"\nValerie raised her brows, \"What kind of code.\"\n\"Mine will be 'At your service, my lady' and yours will be 'Kneel before the one you love.'\"\nValerie blushed, \"O-Okay...\"\n--------**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 45: Chapter 44- Hurting her\nThere were two reasons Austin wanted to meet that man at the eatery even though he was aware of the demon's presence in the Academy.\nFirst, he wanted to assess the credibility of the man, and second, he wanted Valerie to understand the origin of his information. If he had simply told her about the demonic entities, she likely wouldn't have questioned his source. However, he valued transparency and chose not to conceal anything from her, openly revealing where his knowledge came from.\nIn the future, if she needs to gain some information, Austin has told her to get the passcode from either him or Sebastian; since it changes daily.\nNow, back in his room, Austin was sitting on his bed, and studying his dagger.\nIt was a sixteen-inch-long dagger, which appears without any details. After all, his Shard has yet to receive its first evolution.\nThrough evolution, not only would his Shard gain new abilities, but Austin might awaken affinity with one of the six elements. Like Valerie, who gained an affinity with frost—a derivative of water.\nRhea has gained control over wind, and Rudolph can manipulate earth to a decent extent. The top ten second-year students have awakened their element. However, they can only utilize the bare minimum.\nThat's why Valerie is hailed as the strongest student; her control over the element is so strong that she can tap into the realm of a sorcerer, and even chant spells.\n'It will take me some time, but I know I will get there... ' Maybe it was because of the system that Austin could now feel himself getting stronger by the day.\nAs of now, his status looks like this,\n[Combat: 17/100]\n{Next reward at 20}\n[Romance: 35/100]\n{Next reward at 40}\n[Durability: 22/100]\n{Next reward at 25}\n[Trickery: 11/100]\n{Next reward at 20}\n[Overall Progression:22/100]\n...\nNo new index has appeared and his durability has gone up because of that punch he received from that darn monkey.\nResting back on his bed, Austin asked, \"Tell me, system, when I ask for a quest, let's assume for durability progression, will I get a completely unrelated task?\"\n[No, host. The system aims at keeping the Host's actual progression and the index meter aligned. As such, QoD would be focused on providing quests that would help you develop the stat for which you are going to request a quest.]\n\"Hmm...\" Austin thought for a moment. Will this be wise?\nThe reason why he was even considering asking for a quest is the demonic intruders and the tournament.\nAlthough he was making progress, he couldn't be certain he would reach the level required to qualify as an Elite.\n'Well, I will just deny the quest if I find it absurd.'\n\"System, I want to request a quest through which my combat can reach 20.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Are you sure you want to use QoD for your combat advancement?]\n[Three consecutive denials would cease the Host's authority over QoD.]\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Yeah, I am sure.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Generating quest....]\n[Assessing the current state....]\n[Ding!]\n[Quest: During combat land a decisive blow against Valerie Corwon.]\n[Reward: +3 points, ???]\n\"...\" Why is this system asking for the impossible?\nLanding a blow on Valerie for the current him was insanely difficult. Valerie has ascended to the top tier of the hierarchy, and he was third from the bottom.\nHeaving a sigh, Austin plopped down on the bed and covered his face with his forearm.\nAlthough it seemed he had surrendered even before the battle, he was thinking of a strategy\n'From what I have observed...there is something I can exploit during our spar...' Austin was already feeling bad about using Valerie for his benefit; however, considering it was about their future, Austin had to do it.\n--------**--------\nAustin and Valerie reached their meeting point exactly at five in the morning.\nAfter a quick warm up both of them were prepared to spar.\n\"Start whenever you are ready,\" With a smile that extruded warmth, Valerie spoke as she took the battle stance without summoning her Shard.\nOn the other side, Austin was wielding his dagger from the beginning; his goal was to at least land a single blow today.\nTaking a deep breath, he lunged into action.\nDashing towards his opponent, he held his dagger in a reverse grip, intending to draw in close combat from the get-go.\nHowever, much to his surprise, Valerie suddenly jumped from her spot, completely disappearing from his field of vision, before Austin felt some weight over his shoulder.\n\"Today we will focus on mid-range combat.\" Kicking his chin, she backflipped gracefully, forcing Austin to stumble on his feet.\n\"Gah, that hurts...\" Austin rubbed his chin as he felt his jaw turning numb by that blow.\nValerie looked concerned, \"Should...I remain defensive for today?\"\nAustin grinned, \"Not a chance. Let's go!\"\nHe lunged into action again; spotting the wooden stick in her hand, he realized that she was going to force him to fight mid-range, so he extended the size of his Shard and drove it forward like a spear.\nValerie smirked before she allowed him to go past the point he expected her to parry and titled her body just enough for his Shard to not hurt her.\n\"Don't remove your eyes from me, My lord.\" Her whisper was dangerous, as Austin's heel was kicked.\n**THUD**\nAustin hit the ground with a thud, groaning as the impact jolted through his body. He rolled quickly to his side to avoid Valerie's next strike, her wooden stick slamming into the floor where his head had been moments before.\n\"You're relentless,\" he muttered, scrambling to his feet.\n\"And you're distracted,\" Valerie countered, spinning her stick effortlessly.\nHis mind raced. She was faster, stronger, and far more skilled. But he wasn't here to win—just to land one clean hit.\nWith a burst of speed, he dashed forward, feinting to the left before cutting to the right. His dagger slashed toward her shoulder.\nValerie sidestepped with ease, her stick snapping down toward his wrist. Austin barely managed to twist away, her blow grazing his arm.\n\"Nice dodge~\" She singsonged.\nAustin didn't pause there. Extending his Shard's blade to nearly its maximum length. He lunged again, swinging the elongated weapon in a sweeping arc to force Valerie back.\nValerie's smirk didn't falter. She ducked low, her stick coming up to block his strike with a satisfying crack. \"Longer reach, same result,\" she teased, twisting her weapon to push him off balance.\nAustin stumbled but recovered quickly, shortening the Shard and darting forward in close quarters. He thrust the blade toward her midsection, hoping to catch her off guard.\nValerie's movements were a blur. She pivoted to the side, her stick smacking his blade away before delivering a sharp tap to his ribs.\n\"Keep your stance balanced,\" she advised, stepping back to let him recover.\nAustin looked up, gritted his teeth, and after summoning his dagger back in his hand, he threw it toward the girl.\nValerie barely moved her head and the weapon missed the target.\nHowever, Austin wasn't done; he clenched his fist, and his dagger took a 180, relaunching towards Valerie from mid-air.\nValerie sensed the movement behind her, as she ducked in at the last moment, \"No!\" Only to realize that the dagger will stab her beloved now.\nIn her crouched position, she launched towards Austin, her pace faster than ever, so she could come between his Shard and him.\nHowever, it was all Austin's ploy,\nThe moment she closed the distance, Austin seized the opportunity. With precise timing, he pivoted sharply, using the momentum to deliver a powerful kick.\nTHUD\nHis foot connected squarely with Valerie's jaw, the girl pausing in her tracks as Austin's Shard disintegrated into fragments.\nAustin took a strong gulp as he removed his foot from her face, and nervously approached her, \"Val....are you okay?\"\nHer face was hidden by her long hair, so he didn't know if she was hurt or angry. Well, he used himself to lure her into his trap, so it would be understandable if she was angry.\nHowever, suddenly, Valerie jumped on him, hugging her Lord closely in her arms, as she said, \"It was brilliant, Austin! You finally realized the essence of a battle.\"\nAustin was flustered as he asked, \"W-What is that?\"\nValerie looked up at him, her face full of smiles, as she said, \"There is no rule when you are fighting someone. Utilize everything you can to defeat your enemy.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, as he cupped her cheek and softly asked, \"Does it hurt?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"Not much, but I like this pain.\"\nAustin raised his brows, but before he could ask, Valerie responded, \"This slight ache would keep reminding me that you are progressing brilliantly. \"\nAustin chuckled upon hearing that, as he hugged the girl and laid back down.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, host!]\n[You have achieved your goal!]\n[Tap to open the reward!]\nYeah, life is good.\n--------**--------\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed reading the chapter.

Even during a spar, Valerie never ignores Austin's safety.\nEven the strikes she lands, albeit using a fraction of her power, make her feel regretful. If not for Austin requesting her to not only dodge, she would have never considered hitting him back.\n\"Let's see...what is this reward?\"\n[Ding!]\n[Whisperwing: A mystical artifact in the shape of a boomerang, imbued with sentient magic that allows it to obey verbal commands. It can alter its speed mid-flight, from swift and lethal to slow and controlled, ensuring precise strikes or safe returns to its wielder.]\n[Limitation: Works only for an hour before enquiring a twelve hours of rest.]\n[Note: It can be leveled up through stats points gained from QoD.]\nAustin's brows were risen as he walked out of the bathroom, with a towel wrapped around his waist.\nHe summoned the weapon in his hand and was surprised by the runes inscribed on it.\n'It's heavy....' Austin had to hold the boomerang with both of his hands and felt he needed to first gain some strength to use it.\n\"Whisperwing...too long....Whip? Yeah, that sounds good.\" As he named the weapon, a greenish hue surrounded the weapon.\nAustin tossed it lightly in the air, and commanded, \"Slow down.\"\nThe boomerang obeyed instantly, its movement shifting into an almost surreal pace. The air around it seemed to ripple and distort as it glided lazily, each rotation deliberate and mesmerizing.\nIts polished surface caught the light, reflecting flashes of green with every turn, as though time itself had bent to the weapon's will.\nAustin raised his brows; this was quite useful.\n\"Okay, now speed up!\" His command was heard and the boomerang instantly tore through the floor and went to the lower floor.\n\"Shit!\" Austin cursed before he called, \"Come back, Whip.\"\nThe boomerang flew into his hand right away, and Austin made no delay in storing it in his inventory.\n\"The hell?\" The resident of the lower room peeked up, \"Austin? Why were you so eager to see me so early in the morning?\" It was a third-year student who was still in bed, and the hole was created right above his face.\nAustin apologized, \"Just some experiment went wrong. Sorry, I will have it repaired by afternoon.\"\nThe senior grumbled before covering his face and ignoring him.\nAustin heaved a sigh and decided to ask Sebastian for help.\n------**------\nWalking out of the dorm, he walked a few meters before reaching the fountain, near which his beloved awaited him.\n\"You look pretty today. Did you braid your hair differently?\"\nValerie's cheeks were hot as she nodded, \"I tried something different.\"\nShe didn't think her Lord would notice it right away. It was just a minor thing yet it made her elated.\nSoon the duo walked towards the main building with their hands connected.\nThey were mostly engaged in conversation related to training and the tournament. They decided to talk about anything related to the demonic entities during lunch, in seclusion.\nOne thing is for sure: these demons are either too weak to be sensed by the soldiers guarding the Academy or too strong that they are hiding their presence brilliantly.\nAustin knew that it was the first option.\nThe one who has sent these demons just wanted to assess the situation of the Academy and learn the premise so during the event, it could become easy to infiltrate.\n\"Just four more days...\" As they reached the classroom, Valerie muttered under her breath.\nWithout asking her, he knew what she meant.\nThe sitting re-arrangement would be happening in four days, and Valerie was determined to sit with him.\n\"Don't worry, I will go with you to ask the Professor,\" Austin assured her.\nSoon Austin walked towards his seat while Valerie sat in the front.\nRhea waved at him, to which the blond Prince just nodded.\nRudolph was sitting silently in his seat, rather than chatting to Rhea, which greatly surprised the Prince.\n'Is he not well?' Austin wondered when the professor suddenly walked inside the class before homeroom time.\n\"Good morning class. I have some news to share.\"\nThe teacher looked a bit hurried, and that urged everyone to pay attention to her.\n\"What happened a few days ago during the assessment trials, was not supposed to happen. We have questioned a few students who suffered because of our failure to maintain security and have come to a conclusion.\"\nThe hot topic of most of the groups was the incident that transpired two days ago. Nothing like that has ever happened in the past.\nValorian Academy boasts capable teachers and reliable security. So, this might be one of the biggest crises they have faced in the past century.\nIt was said that the investigation was in progress, but now it seems they have finally found the culprit.\n\"There is someone from the student's body who was involved in the incident. And I am ashamed to say, that the impostor is from the Apex Circle.\"\nA round of gasps resonated inside the classroom upon hearing that.\nEveryone began whispering and murmuring about the allegation the Professor just made.\nNot so long after, Rhea asked, \"But ma'am, what led you to such a conclusion?\"\nThe Professor heaved a sigh, \"I was about to tell you all about it. Sit down first.\"\nRhea heeded her command before the class turned silent, wanting to hear her reason.\nThe older one voiced, \"The only person who spotted the barrier chanter was Rudolph. He was the one who disrupted the chanter's magic and allowed us, the Professors to enter the forest.\"\nEvery eye turned towards the biggest guy in the class.\nAustin frowned upon hearing that; Rudolph wasn't supposed to find the chanter. Canonically, he should have stayed with Rhea to help her deal with the devi. However, it seems, the presence of Valerie allowed him to think more calmly in the situation and move independently during the incident.\n'Did he disciver who it was?' His unasked question was answered by the Professor,\n\"Although he wasn't able to see the impostor's face, Rudolph reported that it was a guy with silver hair.\"\nWhen the lady said that, the students instantly turned around to the only silver head in the class—the Vice President of the Student Council and the heir of Duke Runebound—Sheldon.\nHowever, all those gazes didn't bother the guy at all, and thanks to the Professor's following words, no one dared question Sheldon either.\n\"However, with the vice headmaster's help, we discerned that it wasn't Sheldon, so no point in suspecting him.\"\nEveryone was aware of the Vice-headmaster's ability to detect lies, as such, no one anymore entertained the thought of Sheldon being the impostor.\nThe lady on the podium added, \"That's why until we don't discern who is the real culprit, the headmaster has decided to keep the students of Apex Circle away from others.\"\n\"...!\" The reaction of the students was quite varying. Some were shocked, some were enraged, and some were nonchalant.\n\"But why should we get treated like this? Not like we did anything here.\" One of the students asked, his voice carrying his frustration.\n\"Why should we be treated like this, Professor? It may be someone from a different year who is an impostor?\"\nThe Professor heaved a sigh and told them, \"I know you all are not happy because of the decision. However, it is an irrefutable fact that one from the Apex Circle was involved in the incident. We have verified it, so until we take the testimony of each student, you all are restricted from returning to your dorm.\"\nWith her voice turning a little cold, the Professor added, \"And that's an order.\"\n--------**--------\nAustin inwardly rejoiced that since they weren't told to return to the dorm, he could spend more time with his fiancée...\nThey can have lunch together, then walk around the garden lesiurely, then have tea together...then...and then...and...\n**SQUELCH**\nHowever, none of his plans, involved him getting murdered by Valerie.\n\"V-Val...\" Austin looked at his fiancée in horror, as her spear stabbed his chest and pinned him against the pillar.\nHis blood dyed his white shirt crimson red as he couldn't believe the woman he loved was suddenly attacking him.\nValerie stepped toward him, not a speck of remorse in her eyes as she said,\n\"It was for a short while, but you annoyed me to no end.\"\n--------**--------\nA/N:- Damn....the fuck.

      "content": "Chapter 47: Chapter 46- Betrayal?\nThe notice for interrogation was not liked by the students; however, to ensure the safety of other students, it was necessary to thoroughly question the Apex Circle.\nCurrently, inside the common hall, only the students of Apex Circle were present. All the other students were told to have lunch back in their dorm room, because of security reasons.\nThe common hall was surrounded by several instructors, who were keeping an eye on the students while one student is sent to the Principal's office one after another for questioning.\n\"And what if the impostor has a shape-shifting ability?\" Rhea asked, to no one in particular as she remained seated at the dining table.\nUnlike usual, Rudolph wasn't around, so it explains why the other girls approached her.\nRhea's dormitory neighbor and her best friend, Cassie, asked, \"Then won't the teachers find out the accomplice of the impostor?\"\nShe got a point since even if someone from the students was allowing the intruder to let them imitate the student, they would get caught during the interrogation.\n\"Well, considering the Headmaster's brains and Vice-headmaster's cruelty, I know they would be able to capture the villain is.\" Another girl with pale yellow hair voiced.\nRhea raised her brows, \"What cruelty?\"\nThe girl seemed genuinely surprised, as she asked, \"Don't you know? The vice-headmaster is an ex-executioner.\"\nRhea rolled her eyes, \"Just because he used to be a slayer doesn't mean he is cruel to innocents as well.\"\nTheir conversation continued as the teacher came to ask for Austin,\n\"Yes, coming.\" Austin got up before following the instructor.\nWhile he walked towards the office, he met Valerie en route, and whispered to her, \"Wait for me in the garden.\"\nThe violette smiled and gave him a nod.\n*Knock*\nAustin knocked on the door once, before stepping inside.\nInside, only three people were standing: the headmaster, the vice-headmaster, and Austin's homeroom teacher.\n\"Good afternoon, sir, ma'am.\" Austin greeted before the bespectacled vice-headmaster stepped forward with his Shard appearing in his hand.\nHarold stepped forward as he said, \"You know the drill. You lie, we will know.\"\nAustin gave him a firm nod as Harold returned to his spot after drawing the circle and stood on the left side of the table.\nThe Headmaster asked, \"First tell me, what is your name?\"\nAustin, without any delay, responded, \"Austin Eryndor.\"\nThe shade of the circle didn't change before Philius asked,\n\"Tell me Austin, are you, by any means, involved with demonic entities?\"\nThis time as well, Austin didn't hesitate, \"No, sir.\"\nA few more questions were asked, all related to that incident or if anything the others said was untrue.\nHe answered only according to what he saw in the forest, rather than letting the knowledge of the game influence his responses.\nAfter nearly fifteen minutes, Austin felt that he had given the proof of him not being the impostor.\nAnd as he thought, \"Okay, Austin-\"\n\"Wait, Headmaster.\" Harold suddenly stopped him; his gaze was firm as ever as he said, \"I want to ask him the last question.\"\nPhilius raised his brows before he gestured for him to go on.\nTruth be told, Austin was now a little nervous. The Vice-headmaster is the only one in the teaching unit that gave him the chills.\nHis aura and appearance always make one think twice before speaking. And that same teacher has decided to interrupt his senior so he could ask Austin a question.\nYeah, he had a valid reason to be nervous.\nThe bespectacled one, stepped forward and asked him, \"Were you aware of the demonic presence here in the academy before this interrogation?\"\n\"...!\" Austin flinched; this was unexpected.\nThe students weren't informed about Demonic entities infiltrating the premises until they were interrogated here. So Austin should also be like others, completely unaware of their presence.\nAustin took a strong gulp, and the pause he took was enough to make Harold even more suspicious, \"Tell me, Austin. Did you know about the demons beforehand?\"\nAustin knew lying was futile here, so he responded, \"Yes, I did.\"\nThe shade of the circle didn't shift, and the only lady in the room gasped, \"Austin....you...\"\nThe blond prince heaved a sigh, \"I knew demons were involved in this because I inquired about it.\"\nHarold frowned, \"How did you know? And who gave you the information?\"\nAustin calmly responded, \"The very fact, a barrier strong enough to restrict even the professors was erected, gave birth to my suspicion. And then Rudolph said it was a silver head, yet it wasn't the Vice-prez. So shape-shifting, right? And demons are known for their ability to shapeshift, so I guessed it.\"\nHarold's frown deepened, \"You still didn't answer my second question. Who is the source of your information.\"\nAustin glanced at the Headmaster before saying, \"It's a common friend of mine and the Headmaster's.\" His suggestive look made Philius realize as he said,\n\"I understand. You can go now.\"\nHarold was perplexed as he glanced at his superior and found him nodding in understanding.\nOnce Austin stepped out Harold asked, \"Sir?\"\nPhilius ignored his question, and told him, \"For now, do me a favor and make someone monitor Austin for the time being.\"\nHarold frowned, \"But that butler...?\"\nPhilius pinched the bridge of his nose, \"I will talk to Sebastian...since it's about Austin's security; hopefully, he will understand.\"\n----------**---------\nValerie was waiting for Austin in the pavilion situated in the garden where they usually sit and talk.\nHer face was turned to the other side as she remained standing silently until she heard footsteps.\n\"Thanks for waiting.\" Austin smilingly said as he climbed the stairs and lovingly looked at his fiancée.\nValerie finally turned to look at him, an unreadable expression on her face, as she said,\n\"Kneel before the one you love.\"\nAustin was stunned for a moment since he nearly forgot about the passcode, but soon he knelt and said,\n\"At your service, my lady.\"\nThere was a soft smile on Austin's face as he kept kneeling, waiting for her to respond.... however, rather than her words, her Shard gave him the response.\n**SQUELCH**\n\"Ugh!\" Austin groaned as she stabbed her spear into his shoulder and picked him from the floor.\nPlanting him against the pillar, Valerie gazed at Austin with a cold look.\n\"V-Val...\" There was a sense of betrayal in his eyes as Austin gazed at his lover.\nWithout a speck of emotion in her eyes, Valerie stated, \"Although, for a short while, you annoyed me to no end.\"\nHer Soul energy made the ground shake, and her aura attracted the attention of the instructors, inside the common hall.\n\"Valerie, stop!\" The Vice-headmaster arrived first and warned the girl.\n\"What the heck are you doing?! Let him go!\" Rhea also arrived and shouted at the girl.\nSoon, the whole pavilion was surrounded by people who were shouting at her, asking her to release Austin.\nThey didn't carelessly move towards her, fearing that she might end up killing Austin.\n\"Student Valerie?! What are you doing to the one you swore to protect?!\" Philius couldn't believe his eyes. The same girl who rejected the offer to receive the greatest honor by joining the Council so she could protect her lover...was now killing him?\n\"W-Why...Val...\" Austin, with tears welling up his eyes, asked her.\nValerie's aura flared and just as she was about to cease his life, a voice interrupted her, \"We need that thing, Val.\"\nEveryone turned their eyes towards the one who spoke, evident shock written over their faces.\nValerie didn't have to turn to know who it was, \"My Lord...\" She whispered, her heart finally regaining the serenity it needed to not slaughter the being who dared impersonating her beloved.\nPhilius's frown couldn't have been any deeper as he asked, \"What in the world is happening, Austin?\"\nThe blond Prince heaved a sigh before stepping onto the stage where everyone could see him clearly before stating, \"We lured the demon, and Valerie captured it. The end.\"\nEveryone gasped as they realized the identity of the one who was pinned against the wall\nThe skin of the fake Austin began to shred and the real face of the demon began to appear.\nThe creature had dark red, cracked skin, like searing embers frozen in flesh. Its jagged, black horns curve upward, shadowing hollow, glowing eyes that burn with malice.\nThe air around it stinks of sulfur and decay, as it glared at Valerie, \"How did you find out?!\"\nThe demon was suppressing its demonic presence quite brilliantly, and there were no mistakes in its appearance as well. And he knew the code as well!\nThen...?\nValerie narrowed her eyes as she voiced, \"If I were you, I wouldn't waste a thought on anything but your own life. Because even if you manage to escape the teachers, it won't matter—I'll be waiting for you out here.\"\n--------**-------\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed the chapter? Drop a comment and let me know.

      "content": "Chapter 48: Chapter 47- Crying Valerie\n[After returning to her room after the date]\nValerie stepped inside her room, and after closing the door, the first thing she did was take out the parchment her Lord handed to her in the carriage.\nWhen he was telling her code, he silently placed the parchment inside her bag while making her notice it.\nHe slowly shook her head and that was enough for Valerie to understand what he meant.\nShe didn't say anything and wordlessly returned.\nA frown marred her face as she read,\n[The carriage driver was paying attention to our conversation; that's why I gave you the code loud enough for him to listen. Now, I can be paranoid but there is no harm in being cautious. Turn around.]\nValerie tilted her head and turned around. However, nothing happened, urging her to read the note once again, only to realize that she needed to turn the parchment around.\n[That's why whenever either of us tells the code, the other one has to attack the other one. If I respond, don't hesitate to incapacitate me. Needless to say, I will do the same.]\n[P.S: I enjoyed the date. Let's go again sometimes.]\nShe smiled reading the last remark, but soon she frowned, as she realized a fatal mistake.\nSomething her Lord noticed and she completely overlooked.\n'I need to train my senses and be cautious all the time.'\n----**----\nAnd thanks to that, Valerie was able to recognize the entity to be inhumane. And it helped that the demon responded to the code; providing her the evidence to attack the entity.\n\"You did good.\" Austin praised his lover as they sat on the resting chairs, before the Headmaster's office.\nValerie smiled, \"It was all your guidance that I was able to judge the situation.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Well, I just asked you to remain cautious.\" Glancing at her he added, \"I was quite surprised when you stabbed that demon without another thought. I thought you might hesitate since he had the same face as me, but I was wrong.\"\nThere was a sense of pride in his voice and admiration for the girl who closed her heart to trap the devil.\nAustin rested his back against the wall, as he said, \"Fortunately, we caught-\" \"*sniff*\"\nAustin paused and instantly turned toward his lover.\nHis eyes widened as he saw large droplets of tears rolling down her eyes, as she tried to hide her face from him.\n\"Valerie?!\" Austin instantly knelt before the girl and cupped her face, \"What happened so suddenly?\" He doesn't know what he said or did to make her cry. Or maybe it was that she got injured while confronting the Demon?\nHowever, the cause of her tears was no one but him,\n\"....it's cruel...to *sniff* assume that...I was not affected....it pained ...me to stab the demon....\" Tears uncontrollably poured down her big eyes as she complained.\nAustin now realized his mistake. He has gotten so used to her brave side, that he sometimes forgets that she is a human as well, and a teenager, on top of that\nHis heart was filled with guilt as he wiped her tears softly and told her, \"I am sorry, Val, I didn't know you were hurting so much...and I just assumed everything was fine.\"\nHe was a failure as her partner to not sense the heavy emotions she had been carrying. He is such an idiot.\n*Click*\nThe door suddenly parted and an instructor stepped out, \"It's conc-what happened to her?\" The woman frowned upon seeing Valerie sob.\nAustin turned towards the older one before asking, \"Can I take her back? She is not feeling well.\"\nThe instructor instantly nodded, \"Yes, sure. The interrogation has concluded and the report will be sent to your office in an hour.\"\nAustin nodded before he got up and said, \"Excuse me.\"\nUnder the instructor's surprise gaze and Valerie's baffled one, Austin suddenly picked his lover in a bridal carry and stood back up.\nSteam erupted over her head as Valerie failed to utter any comprehensive word, being so intimately close to her Lord.\n\"Okay then, instructor, see you tomorrow.\" Bidding farewell to the lady, Austin stepped forward and headed out of the building.\nValerie, after failing miserably to say anything for the first ten seconds, finally uttered, \"I-I can walk...\"\n\"Do you not like it?\" He asked; doubt in his eyes.\nValerie opened her mouth to say something, but then she sealed her lips and clutched his shirt before saying, \"I-I will be in your care.\"\nAustin smiled, as he descended to the base floor.\nSince it was already night there weren't many students around. However, those who were moving about stopped in their path and gazed at the handsome young man carrying his blushing princess.\nAustin was immune to feeling embarrassed if it came to his beloved's sake. He cannot and will not leave Valerie alone, given her current state of mind.\n\"A-Are we not going to the infirmary?\" Valerie asked, considering she thought they were going to be together for the time being and the infirmary was the only place.\nHowever, \"There are many people there, so let's go to my room.\"\nAustin took out the Stopwatch from the Inventory before tapping on the reset dial—\n*DING*\nInstantly, everyone and everything paused around him as Austin entered the dorm, and sped towards the first floor.\nHe found Sebastian standing before his room, but first, he opened his door and stepped inside.\nClosing the door, he heard a 'ding' from the stopwatch, as he gently laid Valerie on the bed.\n\"What....just happened?\" Valerie was too astounded to suddenly find herself inside Austin's room, even though she was outside the dorm, a moment before.\nAustin shook his head, \"Nothing happened. Now, relax here, I will bring something warm for you to drink.\"\nValerie was still too baffled but she didn't insist on asking him about it and saw Austin walking towards the door.\n*Click*\nParting the door, he called out, \"Sebas.\"\n\"Young master? Is everything alright?\" The butler was startled to find his lord inside the room, even though the room was empty a moment—ah.\n\"Yes, everything is fine. In an hour, you will receive a report from the school, regarding the interrogation of the Demon. Please bring it to me.\"\n\"Yes, my Lord...and do you need something else?\" Sebastian asked.\nAustin was a little embarrassed to say, \"Bring me some tea and snacks. Valerie is staying at my place today.\" The butler must have already heard her voice so there was no point in hiding.\nSebastian smiled ear to ear as he said, \"Remember you both are just students now so-\"\n\"I know, agh!\" Austin closed the door and walked back in.\n\"What happened?\" Valerie asked her Lord, seeing him being all flustered.\nAustin took a deep breath and shook his head, \"Nothing....and you shouldn't get up.\"\nAustin told her as he walked towards the small kitchen he had in the room. He set the milk to boil, and on one side, he took some cold milk and added dark chocolate to it, before putting it on flames.\nStirring the chocolate container continuously, he prepared a strong syrup before adding sugar to it, before taking two cups.\nPouring the syrup, he then poured the hot milk and a bit of sweet chocolate bits over it.\nBringing the two cups near the bed, he said, \"It's sweet, so brace yourself.\"\nValerie paused while getting up before she stiffly nodded and took the mug.\nAustin told her, \"Having something warm and sweet helps in elevating the mood.\"\nValerie nodded once again; since it's her Lord made, she can even consume poison.\nSitting on the chair beside the bed, he said, \"After thinking it carefully, I realized how difficult it must have been. For you...to hurt a being who looked just like me.\"\nValerie's eyes were drawn to the hot chocolate as she remained silent.\nShe couldn't explain how painful it was for her....for that wretched being calling out to her in the voice that affected her the most.\nAlthough she knew that she was facing a fake, her hands were shaking. Although her soul knew that it wasn't her Lord, the very slight chance of her judging things wrongly made her heart tremble in apprehension.\nIn those few seconds, she went through several mood swings.\n\"I am sorry you had to go through something like that, Valerie...however, there might arise a chance where you might have to go through something similar again.\"\nValerie looked at her beloved with a sad look, \"I know...but I don't know how I will face that situation again.\"\nResting his and her cup aside, Austin sat on the bed and brought the girl in his arms, \"Everything will be fine, Val. I will always be there for you.\"\nValerie smiled as she rested her face on his chest and hummed, \"I will be relying on you...\"\n--------**--------\nA/N:- What engaged?

      "content": "Chapter 49: Chapter 48- Let's go hunting\nValerie was mentally exhausted so she fell asleep not so long after.\nAustin remained sitting on the bed beside her, once he draped a duvet over the girl.\nThe situation with the demon was not following the canonical events.\nOriginally, the demon should have realized the potential of Rhea and should have approached her. However, Austin knew that with Valerie's presence in the academy, they would target her. As such, despite knowing that they were being heard, he voiced the code and wrote a note to Valerie to remain cautious.\nThe reason they are targeting students even though there are far stronger people in the academy—the Vice-headmaster for example—reveals their future plans.\n'The tournament...' They would be targeting some specific students to recruit them during the tournament. As such, the presence of variables who hold strong minds and overwhelming strength, like Valerie, needs to be eliminated beforehand.\n'They will try to convince them to join and if they get rejected, they will kill them during the tournament...'\nShaking away those thoughts, Austin took the parchment he received from Sebastian. It was the report from the instructors regarding the interrogation.\nThere was nothing much, other than,\n[Infiltrated, caught, escaped, searching, eliminated, taken over.]\nThese were a few comprehensible words the demon spat out before the vow killed it.\nThe Vow on the Demon kind doesn't allow them to betray their kins. That's why, Austin was surprised that even this much was extracted from the demons.\n'Hmm...let's see....infiltrated the academy. They were caught...hmm...caught while chanting the barrier? Possibly. Escaped...who? Searching who? The escaped one? And then eliminate them? Taken over...what, academy? No, if that was spoken for their intention, then it should have been 'take over', not 'taken over.' It means they have taken over something already. But what-ah! Identities, maybe.'\nAustin was rummaging through his memories, piecing his knowledge of the game and the current situation.\n'Although it was just a minor change, various things have been altered...' Austin fighting for Valerie's sake and preventing her from getting suspended has changed the focus of various foes' in her direction.\nAlthough Austin could never regret standing up for his lover, he was feeling a little apprehensive about the future.\nValerie's presence has outshined Rhea's as such, it was inevitable for her always to be surrounded by danger.\n\"mm...\" Hearing her mumbling, Austin's eyes directed toward his beloved.\nHer serene sleeping face allowed his heart to regain its composure as he brought his hand toward her face and softly caressed her cheek,\n\"While I have you by my side...I know nothing can go wrong.\"\nAustin remained seated there for a bit longer before he turned his eyes toward the window.\nGetting up, he took out the Stopwatch from his inventory and opened the window.\nThe radiant moonlight converged and fell on the artifact.\nAustin knew that today was a full moon night, so he chose to use the watch rather than the Mask he got from the system. He didn't want to surprise Valerie with the sudden use of an unidentified and unlicensed artifact.\n\"Hmm?\" His eyes suddenly spotted a lone figure in the backyard, who was swinging his sword even though it was almost midnight.\nOnce Austin filled the Stopwatch's energy to the brim, he glanced at Valerie once before jumping through the window and landing a few meters behind Rudolph.\n\"Hey, you okay?\" Although Austin knew that the big guy liked to train, it was still quite unusual for him to neglect his routine and remain awakened for this long.\nRudolph paused mid-swing and turned to look at him, \"Did I disturb your sleep?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"I wasn't sleeping. Anyway, is everything alright with you?\"\nAustin has noticed that ever since Rudolph has returned from the forest, he has remained isolated. He doesn't even approach Rhea and mostly remains silent.\nRudolph remained hesitant for a moment...but then he revealed, \"After what I faced in the forest...I am quite shaken up.\"\nAustin raised his brows, as he asked, \"I never got to hear it from you. What exactly did you see?\"\nRudolph planted his large sword on the ground, as he muttered, \"It was a figure enshrouded in a cloak. I was only able to see its silver hair and golden eyes, while I tried to fight that being.\"\nLooking annoyed, he clenched his fist and uttered, \"It was frustrating to lose to that creature, who tried to harm my friends. I wish I had been stronger I would have captured that bastard.\"\nAustin hummed, and after crossing his arms, he asked, \"So you are punishing yourself because Rhea got injured?\"\n\"...in a way, yes.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Look Rud, there was nothing else you could have done. Disrupting the barrier was quite important as well. So stop punishing yourself.\"\nRudolph nodded, \"Thanks for that...well, I also understand that pushing myself like this won't do. I need to progress slowly.\"\nAustin nodded in agreement, \"Indeed, and if you get injured while overworking yourself, Rhea will blame herself.\"\nRudolph rubbed the back of his head, \"Well, can't let that happen.\"\nA brief pause descended between them, before Rudolph said, \"I will be going to train in the forest after classes tomorrow...sparring against students is not helping me, so I am thinking of learning from real challenges.\"\nAustin was surprised, \"You know its not allowed us to explore the forest without permission, right?\"\nRudolph scoffed, \"I know I won't grow strong unless I take some risk. And that goes for you too, Austin...unless you don't take some risk, you will always get protected by Valerie, just like how she protected you back in the forest.\"\nAustin clenched his fist as his gaze drew to the ground.\nRudolph stepped forward before suggesting, \"We should be strong enough to protect the ones we love. That's why I am suggesting you come with me and explore new challenges.\"\nAustin looked up at him before asking, \"Will that help?\"\nRudolph assured him, \"I have gone hunting several times before joining the academy, so I know how much one develops their skills out in the wild rather than getting taught by these instructors.\"\nAustin slowly nodded, \"You are right...however, the problem is Sebastian. He will not allow me to go.\"\n\"Then don't tell him,\" Rudolph instantly added, \"We will just leave for the forest right after the final bell, and escape through the back gate of the school.\"\nAustin pondered for a moment, before nodding, \"Okay then, let's go hunting. Just the two of us.\"\nRudolph shook Austin's hand, and not so long after, they decided to retire to their rooms.\nJust as Rudolph turned, Austin asked, \"Hey, where is your beloved dagger? You aren't carrying it?\"\nRudolph turned still for a moment before turning towards the blond; he said, \"...I kept it in my room since it was a bother to carry around.\"\n\"Hmm...well, good night. See you tomorrow.\"\n----------**---------\n\"Did he suspect anything?\" Just as Rudolph entered his room, a voice called out; however, the raven-haired ignored the other one, and first, he rested his sword against the wall.\nWalking toward the cupboard he took out a dry towel, and began wiping his face when he heard,\n\"Is he coming along or not?\" The other one asked again, urging Rudolph to say,\n\"Yeah, he is. However, I don't think that butler would not follow him.\"\nThere was an annoyed sneer on his face as Rudolph...or the demon sat down and faced his brethren.\n\"That butler is dangerous. He can sense our presence and is quite wicked for an old man. We need to pay close attention.\" The other demon added.\nHowever, the demon impersonating Rudolph shook his head, \"If that butler follows we won't take Austin as a hostage. It would be too dangerous.\"\nThe other demon didn't say anything since, after a bit of contemplation, he also agreed.\nThese two demons weren't strong enough to go against Sebastian, whose rank and experience are unknown.\nSebastian was the only one who sensed the witchcraft that was used to chant the barrier. Sebastian even attacked the barrier at the exact spot, where the demon was standing on the other side.\nAs such, it becomes necessary to avoid confrontation with that butler, since they could no longer make any mistakes in this mission. They have already lost their brother today.\nOriginally, they didn't plan on kidnapping Austin; however, after realizing the real mastermind behind this incident, they decided to take Austin as a hostage and use him to lure Valerie into their trap.\nAnd once Austin's purpose would be fulfilled, the blond Prince would be bestowed with the most gruesome death.\n'Just you wait Austin....I swear I will make you pay for the death of my brother. Just a few more hours, enjoy your freedom as much as you can.'\n--------**-------\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed reading the chapter. I am searching for Valerie and Austin's images, but if you have suggestions, post them here or on my discord.\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Chapter 49- Hunting(1)\nHow long has it been? Rudolph doesn't know.\nHis wound was still actively bleeding, and if not for him learning survival skills from his father, he might have died long ago.\nRudolph was attacked by the demon when he went to find the barrier chanter.\nA huge wound was inflicted on his torso, and the boy had no option but to run for his life. His Soul Shard was damaged in the process of warding off the demon that was on his tail, but more than his life, nothing more was important.\n'Where am I right now...' He gazed at the surroundings and couldn't discern whether he was inside the Academy forest anymore or not.\nHe was being chased by one of the two demons, with the naked intention of slaughtering him before Rudolph could reach the teachers and inform them about the Demonic presence.\nClutching the wound with the makeshift pad he made with leaves and fur, Rudolph found his vision swirling and his consciousness slipping off.\nHe knows if he faints now, he might never wake up again. Even if he doesn't die because of blood loss, the wild beast in the vicinity would surely feast upon his body before he wakes up.\n'No...I can't die now...I have to return to Rhea...and tell her my feelings ..my parents...they are waiting for me as well...' Using those emotions as his crutches, Rudolph pushed himself off the ground and headed towards a random direction, praying that he find someone who can help him.\n---------**---------\nThe next day, the two demons had kept their eyes on Austin since the morning.\nThey have noted that Austin trains with their target early in the morning, so they assumed it might be a part of their daily routine. However, today, they weren't spotted training together.\nSecondly, Valerie wasn't found waiting for Austin at the fountain, something that was quite unusual.\n[Target hasn't left her room since last night.]\n[Must be the weak mind of the human that got burdened.]\nThe two demons communicated as they realized the possible reason for Valerie not leaving her dormitory. If Austin had made contact with her after last night, then they might have suspected Austin being suspicious of Rudolph. However, Austin hasn't tried to contact Valerie at all.\n[Austin is approaching the classroom. Make sure not to get overly excited, and don't let anyone else catch the whiff of our plan.]\nAny other baggage along with Austin was undesirable; that's why the demon impersonating Rudolph told Austin not to share anything about the secret hunting trip.\nThat's why, the fake Rudolph strikes at that point where every man is feeble—their ego.\nJust when the demon made him recall the fact that Valerie protected him back in the forest, Austin aggressively reacted; showing that, as a man, he couldn't let himself get protected by his woman anymore.\n[Target has entered the classroom. Normally chatting and greeting others.]\nThe demon responded as it continued to closely monitor Austin, who didn't seem anything out of the ordinary.\n[I have spotted the butler; going after him.]\nThe other demon caught sight of the grey-haired butler heading out of the boy's dormitory while holding a folder in his hand.\nThe demon, who had a camouflaging skill, blended in the surroundings and followed Sebastian from a decent distance to not get caught.\n[The butler is approaching the library.]\n[Keep a close eye on him. Follow him into the urinal as well.]\n[Understood.]\nThe fake Rudolph didn't want to involve any risk in this mission. Kidnapping Austin could grant them so many benefits that their Lord might rank them up in the army.\nAnd not only monetary benefits, through Austin the demon could offer its Lord a strong corrupted warrior as Valerie as well.\n'The girl is crazy enough to willingly jump into the Cursed Pond and serve the dark side.' the Demon barely suppressed its grin, thinking of the near future.\n\"Good morning, class.\" Soon the homeroom teacher arrived and informed them, \"Valerie is not well today, so Sheldon, you are on disciplinary duty today.\" The silverhead nodded before the class began.\nThere were a few who were surprised to hear that the disciplined Disciplinary in-charge was taking a break from school. However, when they recalled yesterday's event they felt it was quite natural.\nThe class began, and the fake Rudolph silently just remained seated. No excess peeking nor asking anything.\nHis one ear was on the surroundings and one was focused on Austin.\n[The butler has left the library cabin only once to get another two-hour reservation. It seems he has been working on something important.]\nHearing his brother's voice, the demon impersonating Rudolph warned,\n[Don't do anything stupid by trying to look at his work. We are not told to get involved with the Capital's matters.]\nBefore coming here, they received information about a few individuals, among which Sebastian also was the one.\nIt was known to the two of them, that Sebastian once used to work for the King, and even after he changed the subject of his servitude, the butler still was involved with national matters.\n[I know, and I won't go anywhere near that man.]\nThe fake Rudolph heaved a sigh before he heard the bell for the lunch ringing, and the students getting up from their seats.\n\"Hey, you wanna eat together?\" The pink-haired girl, who was their secondary target, approached the demon.\nRudolph slowly shook his head as he said, \"I have some work to do. I will see you later.\" Saying so, he got up and walked away.\nThe demon couldn't stay around with those people who know Rudolph closely or they might suspect its identity. As such, it was keeping itself away from as many people as it could.\nRhea watched Rudolph walking away with a concerned look on her face. She could sense that something was wrong with him, but since he was refusing to talk things out, she was left with no other option but,\n\"Austin.\"\nThe blond Prince was surprised to be approached by Rhea all of a sudden, as he paused in his tracks and asked, \"What happened?\"\nThe pinkhead asked, \"Can you do me a favor and talk to Rudolph? He seems quite troubled these days.\"\nHearing her words, Austin frowned slightly as he said, \"I am concerned as well for him...okay, I will do something.\"\nRhea smiled before she thanked him.\n'I should probably visit the library after school and finish my assignment...' With those thoughts, Rhea walked away and joined her friends.\n----------**---------\n[The Butler has come out for the third time to get himself some water and asked for another two hours of reservation. It seems he was given some emergency work.]\nAs the last class neared the conclusion, Rudolph heard his brother's voice in his head.\n[It's good then. The butler seems busy and Austin most probably won't tell him about the hunting trip.]\nThe fake Rudolph replied, only to hear,\n[Then can I return to the room and relax a bit? I am quite tir-]\n[Don't you dare move from there!] The fake Rudolph flared, his eyes widened in agitation,\n[You need to keep an eye on him! If he suspects something or changes his mind to follow his master, we would be done for! So you better stick to that place!]\nThe fake Rudolph ordered, only to hear the other side grumble,\n[Fine, I understand. But Kalwar, you need to feed me fresh human meat after this.]\n[Yeah, whatever. Just do your job properly.]\nAs Rudolph finished speaking, the class bell rang and the teacher finally walked out of the class.\n'Finally, after today, I won't need to sit in this useless class...' Kalwar knows that nothing could be a better teacher than life, as such it felt all this academy and classes were nothing but a waste\nHe packed his book and was waiting when suddenly someone approached him, \"Are we still going?\"\nRudolph barely suppressed a grin, as he hummed, \"I am going for sure, but what about you?\"\nAustin tightly held the strap of his bag and said, \"I didn't tell anyone so there won't be anyone to interfere. Let's go.\"\nRudolph nodded before he picked up the bag and got up, only to hear, \"Where are you two going?\"\nKalwar inwardly clicked his tongue hearing the secondary target suddenly jumping in their conversation.\nAustin raised his brows and replied, \"Just planning to spar a little. What about you?\"\nKalwar heaved a sigh hearing that Austin didn't reveal their plans.\nRhea shrugged, \"I got some paperwork to finish. Then see ya.\" She waved at them and walked away.\nRudolph turned toward Austin before asking, \"Should we also go?\"\nThe blond Prince nodded before the duo approached the entrance of the class.\nKalwar grinned as he saw the Prince casually following him towards the back entrance of the school.\n'Finally, I will take my revenge!'\n--------**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 51: Chapter 50- Hunting(2)\n\"Thank you for making some time for me, Lord Corwon. That day, we couldn't talk properly.\" It was after a few days, that Aiden requested a meeting with Duke Corwon.\nSince he was in the capital, Adam didn't mind meeting with the first Prince who seemed rather eager about something.\n\"No need to thank me, Aiden. So, was there something important you wanted to discuss?\" Adam asked as he picked up his teacup and took a small sip.\nThe blond Prince, with a soft smile, said, \"I wanted to inform you that your daughter and my brother's relationship has improved quite brilliantly in these few days. As a father, you must be worried about her, so I thought I should inform you.\"\nCorwon was surprised; since he had been in the Capital for the past few weeks, he hadn't received any word from Valerie through letters, so he didn't know.\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"Yes. Recently, because Austin 'refused to return' to the capital, Valerie also decided to stay there and keep his company.\"\nDuke Corwon's brows drew closer a little, as he asked, \"Austin didn't return? Why?\"\nAiden barely suppressed a smile, and with a saddened look, he said, \"Well, I feel like a failure as a brother to say this but...I feel my presence has been making Austin feel like an 'outsider'.\" Very faintly, to the point one cannot notice unless they are told about it, Aiden's eyes glowed when he uttered the last word.\n\"Outsider...I have also heard a few things about Austin's reluctance to associate with his own family.\"\nAiden nodded, \"Indeed...it seems, after my return, everyone has always been focused on me, which made my brother quite disheartened. And for that, I cannot help but 'blame myself'.\"\n\"You shouldn't blame yourself for something you are not responsible for, Aiden! And it wasn't like others were paying attention to you for nothing. They saw potential in you to be the next king.\"\nThat's right. Adam also feels that Aiden has all the qualities required to become the next Monarch. Not only is he a level-headed young man, but also a brilliant swordsman as well.\n\"I feel honored to hear those words from you, Lord Corwon. It's just that Father had mother supporting him, so he was able to handle everything so perfectly. I also hope I can 'find a woman' capable like my mother who is both strong and intelligent, who can 'support me'.\"\nThis time Adam didn't say anything immediately. He was forced to think about what Aiden said.\nCedric indeed received a wife who supported him in his various phases. Even Corwon, who once was a Commander of the Royal Order, was promoted to a Duke suddenly. As such, if not for his wife he might not have been able to manage things.\nAnd as the next ruler, Aiden also needs a competent partner...someone like...\n\"Okay then, Lord Corwon, I won't take any more of your time.\" Aiden got up from his seat, urging Adam to get up as well, as the two men shook hands.\n\"Let's hope Austin and Valerie have a good future.\"\nAdam nodded, however, looking at him anyone could tell that his mind was clustered with thoughts at the moment\nAiden grinned, 'Perfect. The seed is sown.'\n---------**---------\nRudolph was leading Austin into the forest after they passed the perimeter of the school. Fortunately, they didn't get caught or this would have ended in the most abrupt and undesirable manner.\n\"Have you come here before to hunt alone?\" Austin suddenly asked, looking a bit cautious of the surroundings.\nSeeing his slightly apprehensive self, Rudolph barely suppressed a grin, as he responded, \"A few times in the past, and don't worry, there aren't any beasts above C-rank here since students often are brought here.\"\nAustin nodded, \"I also know that, but I am new to hunting and a D-rank at that.\"\nRudolph wanted to scoff; a Prince so weak and needed to be protected by a woman. Such a sore loser.\nThey trod through the shallow wilderness and entered the heart of the forest where only huge trees and the sound of monsters movements could be sensed.\nAustin took a strong gulp as he said, \"Isn't it enough? We are already too far from the Academy.\"\nRudolph turned towards Austin before muttering, \"Yeah, this should be fine. After all, even if you shout, no one will hear your cries.\"\nAustin frowned as he asked, \"What do you m-ah!\"\nHe gasped upon seeing Rudolph's skin melting, and a red skin appearing from behind the shell.\n\"A demon....?\" Austin's eyes parted wide as he saw the creature finally showing its real self.\nThe demon's flesh was a deep crimson, slick and raw as though freshly flayed, with patches of blackened veins pulsating just beneath the surface. Its face twisted unnaturally, the jaw elongating to reveal jagged teeth that jutted out at uneven angles.\nClawed hands, gnarled and bony, twitched erratically, and its eyes—sunken and glowing a sickly yellow—seemed to bore straight into the soul. A faint stench of burning meat filled the air as Austin froze, unable to tear his gaze away.\nThe demon grinned, a grin that could make one skin crawl in disgust, as it stated, \"Surprised? Well, I did expect you to be naive but this much that you didn't sense anything strange in my behavior?\"\nAustin's eyes were still parted wide, as he asked, \"You...then where is my friend?!\" He shouted as he summoned his Shard.\nThe demon laughed, his laugh resonating across the forest, making Austin flinch before the demon looked back at him and said,\n\"Look at you! Being on the verge of death yet worrying about others. Aren't you an innocent one?\"\nAustin took a strong gulp as he said, \"Y-You can't kill me...I-I am the second Prince-\"\n\"Pfft- do you think I give a fuck about that? We are here to get you, and through you, we will lure that bitch named Valerie.\"\n\"Valerie?! What do you need from her?!\" Austin cried, his grip on his Shard becoming firmer.\nThe demon snarled, \"That girl is far more useful than you could ever be. She will be corrupted once she is taken back. And not only her, during the tournament numerous students from various academies would be recruited into the demonic army.\"\n\"And you know the first task they would be given? To slaughter their brethren.\" Kalwar muttered a sense of euphoria in his voice. It's always fun to watch the corrupted humans destroy their homes, and then once they realize what they have done, their cries sound the best. Ahh~~\n\"Such wicked plans....who in the world can be so...cruel...\" There were tears in Austin's eyes as he muttered,\n\"My master, one and only Lord Zevrath.\" And now, after succeeding in this mission, Kalwar would become one of the seven Generals under Zevarath..finally!\n\"So cruel....so cruel...\" Austin's cries sounded melodious in his ears, but then, \"...trying to be so cruel that it sounds childish.\"\nKalwar frowned as suddenly Austin raised his face, and all the traces of fear and remorse disappeared from his face.\nHe wiped the tears and heaved a sigh, \"So that's the plan, eh? And this Zevrath...he is the King of Demonic Beast, right? He has fallen so much to target children now?\"\nThe previous fear and anxiety were no longer seen on his face as Austin casually muttered\nKalwar spat, \"Why are you pretending that you don't care about all this? Do you understand what kind of situation you are in?\"\nFor some reason, even though nothing had changed other than Austin's expression, Kalwar was experiencing a bad sensation...something was not right.\n\"Your acting skills are top-notch, master.\" Suddenly, a voice sent a jolt down Kalwar's spine as it twirled on its feet and turned towards the source of the voice.\n\"Y-You...!\"\nThe biggest obstacle that could ruin this mission—Sebastian!\n\"How are you at two places at the same time?!\" Kalwar barked as it asked its brother just a few seconds ago, and Sebastian was still in the library.\nAustin chuckled, \"You demons are so easy to fool that I really don't find anything to be threatened about.\"\nKalwar clenched its fist, its nail digging into its flesh as it turned toward Austin and spat, \"How did you find out?!\"\nAustin yawned, \"There were so many hints, but let me give you the strongest one.\" With his eyes turning cold, Austin stated, \"Rudolph never separates his beloved dagger from him...even while sleeping.\"\nThe demon gritted its teeth. Just a dagger was enough to make him realize?\nAustin shrugged, \"I even gave you a hint that I am suspicious by deliberately asking for the dagger; was testing your IQ. But I guess I was right about you guys being mindless creatures after all.\"\n\"Damn you!!!\" Kalwar suddenly launched toward Austin, its nails elongating. The demon believed that Sebastian might jump in. However, Austin suddenly summoned his Shard and threw it towards Kalwar.\nThe demon simply swatted the dagger away—only to be hit by Austin's fist—making the demon realize,\n'The dagger was just a feint...'\nKalwar leaped away, feeling its nose bleeding.\nAustin looked at his fist with a grin, as he muttered, \"Don't interrupt the battle unless you see him using some dirty tricks, Sebas. I wanna test a few things on this test subject.\"\n\"As you command, my Lord.\"\n---------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 52: Chapter 51- Hunting(3)\n\"Please don't panic after hearing what I am about to say,\" Austin warned as he made Sebastian and Valerie sit in front of him; early in the morning.\nWhen Valerie woke up, her Lord said that they wouldn't be doing any training today since there was another urgent matter they needed to take care of.\nShe was baffled but considering how serious he looked she didn't say anything and remained seated.\nSebastian was also startled when his master came to wake him up at four. It was quite unusual for his master to wake up before him, so Sebastian already guessed it was something urgent.\n\"What is it, Young Master?\" Sebastian asked, a bit of anxiety reflecting in his voice.\nAustin calmly told them, \"I am being lured by a demon into the forest today.\"\nValerie's eyes widened and Sebastian frowned upon hearing that. However, before any of the two could have said something, Austin added,\n\"The demon has impersonated Rudolph and has invited me into the forest for hunting yesterday. He has asked me to not tell anyone, especially you, Sebastian.\"\n\"Then we should hurry up and inform the authorities!\" Valerie hurriedly spoke. The very thought of her Lord being targeted by the Demon made her much more apprehensive than she could ever have for herself.\nAustin shook his head, \"There were three Demons. If we take out the one who lost its life yesterday, there are still two left. That means the Demon could be anyone...a student, a teacher, or maybe the Headmaster. That's why we cannot trust anyone.\"\nSebastian nodded, \"You are right. These Demons are brilliant in masking their presence and proficient in sneaking at places. I am assuming that it's because of their skills that they were selected to infiltrate the academy.\"\nHearing the butler's words, the only conclusion Valerie could draw was, \"That means...you are going with that creature?\"\nAustin slowly nodded, \"I have to Val, or we won't be able to capture the Demons. They can change their appearance, and since I am sure one of the two has taken Rudolph's form, we shouldn't risk our chances here.\"\nAlthough Valerie knew that her Lord was making the right decision here, she couldn't help but feel worried about all this.\n\"My lord, there is a high chance for the other demon to be watching me all the time.\"\nAustin nodded, \"Yes, Sebastian, that's why I want you to remain before their eyes all the time, even when I go with the Demon into the forest.\"\n\"Then I will follow you!\" Valerie immediately added. If she could be near him, then at least she might have the assurance that nothing would happen to him.\nHowever, \"No, Valerie, your presence is too strong, and the Demons would keep an eye on you. Since I brought you here without letting anyone notice us, the demons would be thinking that you are in your dormitory.\" After all, Austin stopped the time when he brought Valerie here.\nSebastian frowned, \"Then young lord, are you planning to go with that thing alone?\" In his voice, one could hear the reluctance.\nValerie also held the sentiment. Although she knew her Lord could protect himself, the opponent, this time, was not a regular human who would use predictive means to harm their nemesis. These demonic creatures are nasty and don't hold any principles while battling.\nAustin heaved a sigh, before suddenly a mask appeared in his hand, \"Valerie, when you wear this mask, you'll be able to impersonate Sebastian. The disguise will only last for ten minutes, so choose a spot where you won't be visible to the demon most of the time. Occasionally, while wearing the mask, make brief appearances in public to keep the demon convinced that Sebastian isn't following me.\"\nValerie took the mask with a frown on her face. She has never heard of such an artifact before that allows such duration of disguise.\n\"Sebastian, drop a blood on that mask just when we are about to leave. And after that, remain hidden as much as you can. After class, I, along with the fake Rudolph, will leave from the back entrance of the school. Follow us silently, and wait for my signal.\"\nSebastia nodded, \"As you command, young master.\"\n---------**----------\n'Really, young master has grown brilliantly in these few weeks. I am so proud of you, young master.' Sebastian was on the verge of tears, seeing how seamlessly everything flowed according to Austin's plan.\nAnd now, the demon was standing before him, stripped of its arrogance as it clutched its mouth which was punched by Austin.\n\"You are weak, aren't you? That's why you were sent here.\" Austin assumed, as he wiped his hand and got prepared for the battle.\nThe Demon narrowed its eyes and didn't respond. There was still a chance for Kalwar to take the brat hostage.\n'While being engaged in battle, I need to get past that butler's reach and grab the Prince.' Kalwar planned its immediate course of action—only to find its eyes widening, as it saw something advancing towards it.\n**SHLINK**\nThe demon ducked in the last moment as a wooden tool flew past the spot where its head was a moment ago.\n\"Nice dodge!\" Austin cried, as he sped towards the Demon and swung his dagger.\n*Cling*\nThe metallic scent of its blood reached the Prince's nose before Kalwar flexed its sharp claw and dropped it toward Austin's shoulder.\nKalwar's claws slashed down, but Austin dodged, the tips tearing his sleeve. In a flash, Austin summoned his dagger and slashed upward, cutting deep into the demon's arm.\nThe demon hissed and swung a kick. Austin jumped back, but the edge of the kick caught his shin, making him stumble slightly. Gritting his teeth, he spun around, throwing a broken plank toward Kalwar's legs.\nKalwar jumped, landing with a crash before leaping at Austin with wild eyes full of rage. It was too fast, a blur of movement that made Austin tense, his dagger raised.\nThe demon appeared from the left, and Austin swung his dagger, but that was a feint, as the demon slashed its claw and damaged Austin's right side.\n\"Agh!\" Austin staggered back, pain shooting through him.\nKalwar vanished again, turning into mist. Austin's heart raced as he spun in circles, trying to track the demon's movement. The air felt thick as Kalwar moved around him, hitting from all angles.\nOne moment, the demon was behind him, and the next, its claws tore into his shoulder. He barely had time to turn before Kalwar appeared on his right, leaving another shallow cut.\nAustin's breaths were shallow, and blood stained his clothes. Kalwar was everywhere—quick and relentless—wearing him down bit by bit.\n\"What happened to you now, Prince?! Can't keep up the grin anymore?\" The Demon mocked, still not traceable with that damned skill of its.\nAustin remained standing, his head hanging low, and his Shard held tightly in his left hand.\nIt was then,\n*CLANG*\nKalwar's eyes widened as its claw was parried by the dagger, even though Austin wasn't even looking at it.\n'A lucky guess!' Kalwar refused to believe that the weakling was able to dodge the attack with his pitiful senses.\nHe vanished again and attacked Austin from the front, only to be met by the same conclusion.\n*CLANG*\nMagically, Austin's Shard appears before its claw and blocks Kalwar from enjoying the slow torture he is inflicting.\nKalwar growled in frustration, disappearing again into the mist. He reappeared behind Austin, his claws slashing downward with deadly force.\n*CLANG*\nThe dagger shot up, blocking the attack without hesitation. Austin didn't even flinch, his head still hanging low.\n\"You're toying with me!\" Kalwar spat, rage fueling his every move. He vanished again, zigzagging in unnatural patterns, aiming for Austin's side.\n*CLANG*\nThe shard was there, perfectly timed, deflecting the strike. Kalwar snarled, retreating only to attack from above. His claws came down like a guillotine, eager to crush the blond.\n*CLANG*\nThe dagger rose to meet him, sending sparks flying. Kalwar's movements grew frantic, each strike more desperate than the last. Left, right, above, below—every attack was met with the same, precise block.\nAustin didn't move. His feet stayed planted, his breathing steady, as if Kalwar wasn't even worth the effort.\n\"You're not even looking at me!\" Kalwar roared, his voice trembling with disbelief. He vanished again, attacking from every angle in rapid succession.\n*CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!*\nThe dagger danced, blocking every strike with an almost mocking ease. Kalwar stumbled back, panting, his claws trembling.\n\"How....\" The demon spat, couldn't believe its eyes that a mere weakling was able to catch up with his renowned skill.\nAustin finally looked up, and the first thing his eyes caught was the system screen,\n[Adapt is in use!]\n[Remaining time: 30 seconds]\nTilting his head, Austin muttered, \"Now, it's my turn.\"\n---------**--------\nA/N:- The Demon is a C-rank, if you are wondering.

      "content": "Chapter 53: Chapter 52- Hunting(End)\nYou cannot grow stronger unless you learn from your enemies. And that's exactly what Austin did when he realized the difference between him and his enemy.\nHe had more than one way to subdue the demon, asking Sebastian would have been the easiest. However, he was striving for a stronger self, wanting to become someone who could stand beside Valere and face the dangers that would be threatening the world in the near future.\nAs such, the most important thing, he needed to do was,\nLearn.\n[Skill 'Adapt' is in use!]\n[Time remaining: 30 seconds.]\nAustin shot toward the demon, his speed exceeding Kalwar's expectations, as it hurriedly raised its claw to parry the attack. However,\n*SQUELCH*\nIt was stabbed from behind, the target in front dissolving into a mist.\nKalwar's eyes widened as it shakily muttered, \"H-How....c-can you use my s-skill....\"\nAustin didn't reply, rather, he drove the dagger into the gut of the demon with all his force.\n'System, add all my three points into combat.' he commanded, as Austin released the hold from his dagger, and began launching and barrage of punches at the demon\nKalwar was overwhelmed by the speed and flexibility of the human, who was easily maneuvering through its defense and launching attacks at its vital point.\n\"YOU FUCKER!!\"\nThe demon roared, its dark energy pulsating and becoming alive.\nKalwar joined its hand and dropped the hammer on Austin's head—only to strike nothing but open air, as Austin disappeared once again.\n**SQUELCH**\nAnother searing pain ripped through the demon's monstrous form as Austin drove his blade deep into its back.\n\"RAAAHHHH!\" The demon roared, its guttural howl shaking the air. It swung its massive arm wildly, trying to crush the human pest clinging to it. But what once made Kalwar proud, now filled him with rage and helplessness.\n*SWISH*\nAustin vanished in an instant, dissolving into a cold mist. Before Kalwar could react, Austin reappeared above him, his silhouette framed against the darkening sky.\nHis fist was drawn back, veins bulging as power surged through him. His glowing eyes locked onto the demon's head like a predator about to deliver the killing blow.\nWith a thunderous crack, Austin's fist slammed into the demon's skull. The sheer force drove Kalwar's feet deep into the ground, the earth splitting beneath the weight of the impact. Blood erupted from the demon's eyes and nose in sickening streams, its body convulsing as a horrific crunch echoed through the battlefield.\nAustin's sleeve shredded from the raw power of the strike, his arm dripping with the demon's foul ichor. The once-proud demon lord now sagged, trembling, pinned in place by the human's merciless strength.\nAustin jumped back and looked at his fist.\n'Increasing combat stat has improved my strength and speed as well...I might become C-rank in a few days at this rate.'\nKalwar dropped to its knees, unable to discern what went wrong and how it ended up being so gravely wounded by a lowlife.\nAustin...was supposed to be weak and should had a fragile ego. What suddenly changed, and how could he use the same skill as Kalwar?\n...nothing made sense.\n\"Before I kill you, tell me where Rudolph is.\"\nKalwar's broken jaw made a guttural voice, \"Dead...killed....ripped to shred-\"\n\"Bullshit. I know he escaped you guys. Your deceased brother gave the information.\"\n\"...\" Kalwar was stunned into silence. It had known its late brother had been captured for interrogation, but it never imagined that its brother would reveal so much before the Vow claimed its life.\n\"Well, not like you are going to say anything. So just-\"\n\"You think this is over?\" Just as Austin raised his hand, with the intention to kill the demon, Kalwar voiced something unexpected.\n\"Do...you...believe, this will end...like this...?\" Raising its broken face, the demon asked, \"....I still have a brother...back in...the academy...and hundreds...of innocent....students...he could kill...within seconds...how are you going to...stop that catastrophe?\"\nAustin narrowed his eyes. Until now, if the demon was confident in its brother, then Valerie hadn't found the last demon.\n'No wonder. If even the security of the academy and Sebastian couldn't sense the demon, then Valerie surely can't...' Austin showed hesitation for the first time.\nThe demon was dangerous...with the ability to camouflage and shapeshift, it could cause mayhem and make people believe something that isn't true.\n\"Imagine...slaughtering people while wearing a certain Prince's facade...how would that look...?\"\nKalwar grinned, liking the hesitation Austin was exposing.\n\"Young master, should I retreat and search for-\"\n\"Don't you dare! If any of you two move, I will give him the command right away!\"\nThis...was bad.\nAustin knew if the demon killed even a few students, the whole plot would shift, and the other students might decide to leave the academy because they mistrust the security. In the first place, he doesn't like the idea of innocent lives getting wasted.\n'Was I hasty...I should have thought about the third demon...' Austin clenched his fist in regret. Despite all the planning, he ended up making a severe mistake.\nHe depended on Valerie a lot for this, and now he was stuck in a deadlock.\n\"So what would it be, Your Highness? Either you come with me, and ensure mine and my brother's safety, or I allow my brother to unleash his fury on your dear schoolmates..starting from that bitch of a fiancée of yours.\"\nAustin growled. This was the second time the Demon had insulted Valerie, and he was on the verge of making an impulsive decision.\nSebastian remained silent, his eyes focused on his master, as the butler awaited any command at the moment.\n'What will be your decision, young master...'\nAustin took a deep breath, and said, \"I-\"\n*CRASH*\nSuddenly something crashed between the demon and the Prince.\nIt was a corpse. A being who was killed...no, slaughtered.\nKalwar's body shook... Its eyes witnessed the body of its brother, yet its mind failed to register what it was witnessing.\n\"Astor...Astor...\" Kalwar shook the body of its brother, however, no response came.\nAustin raised his brows and turned toward the female who appeared from behind.\nThe pink-haired teenager had a cold look in her eyes as if killing a demon was nothing she felt anxious about. However, only Rhea knows how difficult it was for her...to kill a sane being who was begging her for its life.\nIt was her luck, that she stumbled upon the demon when she went to the library a few minutes ago. After that, the demon tried to escape but she chased it down and hunted the being who could have become the reason for her classmate's death.\n\"You....killed...you killed my BROTH-*KWHACK*\" The Demon wasn't allowed to cry as a fast-paced boomerang crushed the beast's head and ceased its existence.\nSebastian's brows were raised, \"I was wondering what you threw at the demon back then...so it was an artifact.\"\nAustin nodded before he retrieved the weapon and approached the corpse of the duo.\nThe beings who could have caused unimaginable damage were slaughtered.\n\"Austin...were they after that beast attack back then?\"\nRhea asked, feeling her heart a bit heavy after slaughtering the demon. This was the first time for her to kill something capable of conversing and was weaker than her.\nAustin glanced at the girl and somehow understood what she was thinking, urging him to say, \"You did the right thing because these two were about to turn the Valorian Academy into a graveyard.\"\nRhea's mouth parted slightly as she turned towards the blond and heard him adding, \"You cannot show hesitation in front of those whose sole intention of existence is to cause mayhem. Remember that, Rhea, or one day, you would be lying somewhere like them.\"\nRhea took a strong gulp and looked back at the two demons.\nHe was right...she could not hesitate in battle or that would be her death.\nSebastian was impressed by the fact that how her master could be cold and blunt in front of others while if it's about Lady Valerie, he becomes all soft and considerate while speaking.\nAustin took a deep breath, before telling Sebastian, \"Sebas...can you do me a favor and join the search team to locate Rudolph?\"\n\"I will also go.\" Rhea instantly added.\nAustin didn't say anything about that, however, he believed that with the school instructors searching for him, it would be pretty easy to locate Rudolph.\n\"Young Master, you should probably get healed up before Lady Valerie sees you.\"\nAustin jolted as he looked down at him...he had received several wounds, which surely would make Valerie panic.\n\"Yeah, I should-\"\n\"M-My Lord...\"\nToo late.\n-----------**---------\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed the chapter.

      "content": "Chapter 54: Chapter 53- Dinner\nAustin didn't leak the information regarding the Demons and only told the Headmaster about the whole situation.\nTo say Philius was surprised would have been an understatement. He was baffled at how many serious and life-threatening decisions Austin took to capture the demon all by himself.\n\"You should have at least told me before following that demon into the forest. Although Sebastian was with you, it doesn't change the fact that you led yourself into their trap.\"\nInside the Headmaster's office, only the two of them were present, when Austin was getting scolded.\n\"Everything happened so fast that I never found the opportunity to notify you. And, that demon was monitoring my movements so making unexpected contact with you would have made them suspicious.\"\nAlthough Philius agrees that what Austin did was the best possible route to handle the situation, he couldn't get rid of the anxiety of thinking of a student endangering their life so casually.\nIt was his failure as a Headmaster that a student had to go to such lengths.\n\"So...are your injuries healed?\" Philius asked as he looked at the bandages around his arm and torso.\nAustin nodded, \"More or less. Just a few days of rest and I will be fine.\"\nThe older one said, \"Take a few days of rest from classes and let your body heal itself. You have been sustaining grave injuries these days.\"\nNot so long after, Austin made his way out of the room.\nPhilius took a deep breath and thought back on the young man, who once used to remain troubled about his shortcomings, always entangled in what he lost. However, now, the same young man has been showing such tendencies that Philius couldn't believe that he is the same Austin.\nCalm, responsible, cunning and brave.\nTaking out a parchment, Philius began writing a letter to the King.\nAlthough Austin has requested to keep the matter a secret from the students, fearing that the news of the demons roaming around might create chaos, it doesn't mean that he couldn't let a father know about his son's deeds.\n'He is no longer a troublemaking child, Cedric.'\n--------**--------\nWhile he was walking back to his dormitory, Austin checked the system,\n[Combat: 26/100]\n{Next reward at 40}\n[Romance: 37/100]\n{Next reward at 40}\n[Durability: 25/100]\n{Next reward at 40}\n[Trickery: 21/100]\n{Next reward at 35}\n[Overall Progression: 26/100]\n[Ding!]\n[You have two new rewards!]\n[Tap to view!]\nAustin raised his brows upon seeing that his Combat, Durability, and Trickery stats had gone up.\n'Fooling a fool has gained me a reward? Nice.'\nHe viewed the rewards,\n[Death Disguise: Upon swallowing the pill, the Host's heartbeat halts for five minutes, effectively simulating death. During this time, the Host is indistinguishable from a lifeless body. The effect persists until the orb's influence completely dissipates.]\n'....this is unexpected ' He couldn't think of using it any time in the near future. However, considering how unpredictable and dangerous the foes were, Austin had a feeling that he wouldn't let the artifact rot in inventory for long.\n'Next.'\n[Absolute Barrier Scroll: Grants the Host the ability to learn the skill Absolute Barrier. The duration of the barrier depends on the Host's intelligence stat.\nThe Absolute Barrier offers complete protection against all forms of damage, both physical and magical, regardless of the attack's strength or intensity.]\n[Current limitation: 30 seconds.]\n[Note: Once the barrier is deployed, it cannot be recalled unless its limited time is up. And after one use, it takes thirty hours of rest before the Barrier can be chanted again.]\n'Cool...' Even if it's for half a minute, if he gets immune to all kinds of damage, Austin knew he would be able to utilize that time to his benefit.\n*Click*\nOpening the door of his room, he stepped inside.\nA smile bloomed on his face when he found Valerie arranging food on the table while wearing an apron.\n\"You cooked food in such a small space?\" Austin's kitchen wasn't big since he never learned to cook in the past. And since there was a cafeteria available, he never found the necessity to bring more kitchen equipment than a teapot and a few cups.\n\"It wasn't difficult since you have kept all the things at their designated places.\" Valerie complimented. Austin's things always remain neat and tidy. As such, Valerie didn't have a hard time finding things in the kitchen.\n\"So? What did the Headmaster say?\" As Valerie rested the pot on the table, she asked.\n\"Just scolded me and praised me a little. He will be sending someone to guard me all the time since Sebas is busy.\"\nValerie frowned, \"Why do you need someone else...when I am here?\" She felt a little shy saying that so boldly.\n\"Well, he doesn't know that you sneak into my room, so there is no stopping him.\"\nValerie blushed hearing that 'sneak' part. When she entered his room for the first time, she was embarrassed to death and had to make up her mind for the whole night to make the decision.\nHowever, now, it seems it was normal for her to climb inside his room.\n\"Austin...do you think I am shameless?\" Although it didn't seem Austin minded her coming here, rather he welcomed her with open arms, it was still quite an unlady-like behavior for Valerie to enter her fiancé's resting space.\nHer mother would have fainted if she had heard about it.\nAustin softly smiled as he held her hand, and spoke, \"The world might regard this shameless, and the things you have learned back home might make you feel bad for coming to my room like this....but, in my eyes, you are the best partner I could have ever asked for.\"\nHis eyes were warm and honest when he spoke, \"It's your care and love that you always come here, so don't ever regard this as a bad thing.\"\nValerie took a deep breath, upon hearing his words.\nThat's right, she shouldn't think about the world when the person whose opinion matters the most to her was content with her presence.\n\"Thank you.\"\nThey then sat down and began eating the dinner she prepared.\nIt was nothing fancy, just curry and rice, yet Austin couldn't stop praising her with each bite.\nThey were talking nothing serious during the dinner. Their talk mostly was about their childhood and the silly things they used to do.\n\"...yeah, I remember that day. Those few guys were nothing but wannabe goons, trying to corner you.\" Austin chuckled, remembering that celebration night when Valerie was cornered by a few kids from noble families.\nShe was just a kid but at that time, her tongue was more poisonous than a lethal snake's. She said things that didn't sit well with them, and they tried to bully her.\n\"And then...you arrived and saved me from them.\" That's my favorite part of that memory. Valerie couldn't forget that time when Austin appeared like a savior...fighting the three older kids, and despite the injury, he continued to fight them until they didn't start to cry.\nAnd when Valerie asked, why did he go this far to hurt them, he said,\n'I only can make you laugh and cry....and I won't let that authority be snatched by some snorty kids.'\nThat statement made her both, laugh and cry.\nAustin grumbled, \"Forget about that. I was just trying to act cool.\" He was a little embarrassed.\nValerie smiled, \"Well, you did look cool.\"\nSeeing the side-eyed look, and that smile on her face, Austin gulped and refused to look at her anymore.\nShe can be pretty dangerous for his heart from time to time.\nAfter dinner, they were washing dishes together, when Valerie asked, \"Did you find any changes in your Shard today?\"\nAustin raised his brows and thought back on the battle with Kalwar.\n\"...I think I did sense something absurd.\" Austin stated, \"When I stabbed the demon, I was targeting its heart, but the dagger stabbed a little lower than the target...it was then when I felt the dagger bending upward.\"\n\"...!!\" Valerie's eyes parted wide, \"Your Shard changed shape on your will?\"\n\"Not conscious but yeah, it heard my wish and bent to target the heart. However, the demon was fast and pushed me off instantly.\"\nValerie was stunned; changing the shape and form of your Soul is no easy feat. No, maybe there are only a few individuals in the world who can do that.\n\"Austin I-\"\n**Knock**\nThey both turned towards the door and heard the person on the other side, \"It's me, young master.\"\nAustin wiped his hand and approached the door.\n*Click*\n\"When did you return, Sebas?\" Austin asked since the butler went with the search team to locate Rudolph.\nSebastian informed, \"Just now, and we have found Sir Rudolph.\"\nAustin's eyes widened, as he hurriedly asked, \"Where is he?\"\n\"In the infirmary, sir. His situation is critical.\"\nAustin nodded before he urged, \"Let's go, Val.\"\nValerie was also about to step out with Austin when Sebastian said, \"Your presence is required somewhere else right now, Miss Valerie. Someone is waiting for you in the administrator's office.\"\nValerie was surprised, \"Who?\"\n\"Your father.\"\n--------**--------\nA/N:- Eager for the next chapter?

Considering the recent headlines about the demon's appearance, many parents have come to check on their children.\nNot to mention, Valerie was directly involved with the demon. It was only natural for Lord Corwon to visit her.\n'Unlike my parents, they care about their daughter.' With those thoughts, Austin entered the infirmary.\nInside, several professors were gathered, and the medical team was working on a single bed where Rudolph lay. His stomach bore a severe wound, and he looked extremely pale. Likely from blood loss and exhaustion.\n\"He'll be saved,\" Harold said, standing beside Austin.\nThe blond prince asked, \"Where was he found?\"\n\"At the outskirts of the Randare Market.\"\nAustin raised his brows. That was at least half a day's travel, and in his condition, Rudolph had made it there.\n'He must've lost his sense of direction...' He sighed, then asked, \"Did he say anything after being recovered?\"\nHarold nodded. \"Just one thing: 'Demons are about to attack... protect Rhea.'\"\nAustin almost chuckled at that. Even on the verge of death, the guy was still worried about his favorite woman.\n'Well, I can't say I can't relate.'\nThere was a brief silence as Harold seemed to be gathering his thoughts. Finally, he turned to the younger one, fist clenched behind his back, and said, \"I apologize for doubting you. And for capturing the demon, I thank you with all my heart.\"\nAustin was a bit taken aback by the man's bow. Considering Harold's devotion to the safety of the students, it wasn't a huge surprise that he felt indebted to Austin.\nWith a soft smile, the blond prince said, \"This school is as important to me as it is to you. There's no need to thank me, Sir.\"\n--------**-------\nValerie, as instructed, made her way toward the administrator's office where her father was waiting.\nShe hadn't received any letter about his visit, so she was a bit surprised.\n\"He's inside,\" the administrator said, and Valerie nodded before walking into the waiting area.\n\"Father,\" she called out as she entered the office, where the violet-haired man sat.\nAdam stood with a smile and walked toward his beloved daughter. \"Valerie, it's been a long time.\"\nThe last time she visited home was during Austin's birthday last year. It had been over a year since Adam had seen his daughter, and he had to admit that she had become even more beautiful in this brief time.\n\"Is everything okay?\" Valerie asked though it should have been her father asking that question.\n\"Yes, everything's fine. Why would you ask?\" Lord Corwon responded, perplexed.\n\"I never received a letter about your visit, and it's unexpected for you—the Duke—to pay a visit out of the blue.\"\nIt wasn't that Valerie didn't feel elated meeting her father after so long. It was just that, considering the enormous workload he always had, she found his unexpected visit strange.\n\"It's natural for me to worry when I hear that my daughter fought a demon,\" Adam huffed, not liking the fact that his visit was being questioned. After all, he was a father before he was a Duke.\nValerie smiled softly and urged him to sit down. She sensed the displeasure in his tone and realized that she might have been too harsh.\nShe poured him a glass of water and said, \"It wasn't very dangerous to handle the demon. Austin planned everything and minimized the risk to almost zero.\"\nAdam's expression shifted when he heard that name, which didn't go unnoticed by Valerie. However, she didn't say anything, instead hearing him ask,\n\"Why didn't you return for the celebration this time? You could have asked Austin to come with you. His family arranged such a grand feast, and the birthday boy wasn't there to enjoy the occasion.\"\nValerie sighed. \"It's not like they celebrated the day solely for him. On the other hand, if the First Prince hadn't been able to come, I doubt they would have arranged such a grand feast just for Austin.\"\nIt pained her to say this, but it was the truth. Austin's family didn't give him the attention or care a child should receive.\nForget about everything else—the news of the demon's appearance had shaken everyone. From farmers to nobles, everyone rushed to meet their children to ensure they were safe.\nAnd what about the royal family?\nAdam took a deep breath and asked, \"So you know that Austin's relationship with his family isn't good.\"\nHis tone didn't carry any sympathy, which Valerie had expected. Instead, it sounded serious, as if he was about to say something significant.\n\"Father, what are you trying to imply here?\" Her tone shifted, and the air around her seemed to change.\nAdam didn't hold back and voiced his thoughts. \"As my eldest daughter and someone with the potential to become a great ruler, I believe you're wasting your potential by staying by Austin's side.\"\n*Tremble*\nThe glass on the table, the chandelier overhead, and the gemstones around the room began to shake and flicker under her aura.\nHer fist clenched, and her eyes turned cold as steel as she asked, \"What are you suggesting, Father?\"\nAdam could tell that his daughter had grown much stronger since the last time they met. But he didn't hold back, stating what he believed to be the best course of action.\n\"I want you to annul this engagement and get engaged to Aiden.\"\n*CRACK*\nThe ground under her feet cracked as she shifted her foot slightly.\nHer overwhelming aura caused the administrator to rush in. \"Is everything okay?!\"\nLord Corwon raised his hand, signaling for the officer to leave, and soon the man was gone.\nValerie's gaze never left her father as she said, \"Father... I've respected every decision you've made for me. Everything you said, I followed without objection. And in return, I asked you for a single thing.\"\nAdam's eyes grew grim. \"I know you asked me never to question your relationship with Austin nor try to separate you two... but you need to understand, daughter. Aiden is a much more suitable partner for you.\"\nValerie took a deep breath and calmed herself. She knew continuing at this pace wouldn't lead anywhere.\nLeaning over the table, she asked, \"What do you require from your son-in-law? Someone who cares for me and is strong enough to protect me, right?\"\nAdam nodded. \"Yes... those are the qualities I need at the very least.\"\nValerie interlaced her fingers and asked, \"Do you remember, Father? Austin was hailed as the weakest noble child until two years ago. Someone who awakened a useless Shard and couldn't grow his strength, no matter how hard he tried.\"\nAdam nodded. \"Yes, that's why we were always uncertain about letting you two get engaged.\"\n\"Yes, but didn't he prove you, and everyone else, wrong by enrolling in one of the top-ranked academies in the world?\"\nAdam was speechless. It was true—Austin had been weaker than any of those noble children who were born with strong bloodlines and trained since childhood. But against all odds, he had been admitted to the prestigious Valorian Academy and made it to the top.\n\"And recently, he fought and defeated a demon—all by himself. If you don't believe me, you can ask the Headmaster.\"\nThat statement shocked him. No one, not even the king, knew about this, as Adam had just met with him yesterday.\nFor Valerie to defeat a demon was praiseworthy, but for Austin to do so was something that left even the most experienced shocked.\nValerie sighed and added, \"And if you're worried about whether Austin takes care of me, let me ask you this, Father... Have you ever stayed awake all night, sitting beside Mother just to comfort her when she was anxious? Not only that—when the entire school turned against me, blamed me for harming a classmate, and even when I believed I was at fault and was ready to accept punishment... do you know who stood by my side and fought to protect my pride?\"\nHer voice trembled, and tears welled up in her eyes. \"It was Austin.\"\nThe room fell into silence.\nAdam looked down, his eyes filled with confusion and regret.\nHe couldn't understand why he ever considered separating his daughter from the boy she adored. It wasn't like he hadn't seen how close they had grown. Yet, he...\n'What is wrong with me?'\nSighing heavily, Adam lowered his head and said, \"Please forgive me, Val... I shouldn't have said that.\"\n\"No, I won't forgive you.\" Without another word, Valerie wiped away her tears and walked out of the room, leaving a defeated father behind.\nUnbeknownst to both, there was someone listening to their conversation. And once Valerie walked out, the man sat down and took out a parchment,\n'Guess Lord Aiden is going to fly in rage...'\n--------**-------\nA/N:- Imagine someone other than her father asking her to break up.",

      "content": "Chapter 56: Chapter 55- Nothing without you\nAustin didn't find Valerie in the common hall, so while assuming that she was still with her father, he returned to his room.\nRudolph's situation was critical but the healer said that she would save him. The healers of the academy are quite well-trained and possess commendable skills. In their hands, Rudolph was safe.\nAustin was currently brewing himself some coffee in his room when he asked the system,\n\"Is there no description I get on Shard? Or maybe a skill like Appraisal?\"\nThe situation with his Shard was quite complicated. His Soul Shard has been acting weirdly, more so when Austin gets into dangerous situations.\nAlthough it has never betrayed him until now, fortunately, discerning the mechanism of the equipment that was attached to his Soul was quite important.\n[Unfortunately, host, the system cannot assign a quest for a specific reward. You can only request a quest to target a specific progression. However, there are chances that the reward obtained from the Overall progression might grant you the skill of Appraisal.]\nAustin hummed, as he whisked the coffee and put the milk to boil.\nThe stress of the three demons was over, and before the tournament, there should be only a few small arcs. However, Austin's main focus was on the tournament.\nHe was, most probably nearing the C-rank now. He would officially become a C-rank with some training and a few quests of the system.\nBefore the tournament, he, at least, needs to reach B-rank—one of the prerequisites of the tournament.\nEven after that, he needs to go through a few tests to be selected as an Elite.\nAnd the journey doesn't end there; during the winter vacation he needs to go treasure hunting as well—and for that he has to do something through preparation.\n'A long way to go…and so less time I have…' Yet, he was optimistic. After all, there was his supportive butler and loving fiancée for him.\n*Knock*\nSuddenly, Austin heard a knock on his door, urging him to turn off the boiler and approach the door.\n*Click*\nSurprisingly, it was Sebastian, \"Young Master…Lady Valerie…in the gym.\" The way he was unsteadily breathing and looked panicked gave him enough reason to break into a sprint as Austin made his way out of the dormitory.\nSeveral thoughts crossed his mind as he advanced towards the gymnasium.\n—---**----\n[A few seconds ago]\nRhea's eyes were parted wide when she arrived in the indoor gym to retrieve something. She wanted to return to the infirmary as soon as she could so she could look after Rudolph. However, the sight she was greeted with froze her in shock.\n\"What the….heck…\" the gym was a mess. Hundreds of wooden training dolls were lying on the ground—snapped and wasted.\nThese are special training dolls with enchantment imbued in them to make them stronger than normal wood. It takes several days for a student to practice against a single doll to break it.\nAnd here…hundreds of them were scattered around.\n**DHAK**\nRhea raised her eyes and turned towards the cause of this mayhem.\nValerie, on the other side, was showing her profound skills in martial arts and beating the nonliving but pitiful training doll.\n**SNAP**\nNot so long after, that training doll snapped as well—leaving none anymore.\nRhea hurriedly approached Valerie, only to stop in her tracks when suddenly Valerie summoned her Shard and pointed it towards Rhea,\n\"R-Relax…I am not here to hurt you.\"\nValerie narrowed her eyes before she released her Shard and turned away.\nRhea approached her again, this time cautiously, and said, \"Your hands are bleeding. You should stop training now-\"\nValerie sharply turned, making the pink head flinch, before the violette stated, \"Listen, I don't want any suggestions from anyone right now. So please, leave.\"\nRhea was troubled seeing that indifference in Valerie's eyes. It reminded her of that day when Valerie snapped her Shard. That day, she was upset because Rhea damaged the dress that Austin gifted. Then today as well…\n\"Val.\"\nSuddenly, they heard a voice from the entrance.\nValerie heard him but didn't turn to look at him—fearing she might cry and let him know all her grief once again. She feared that she might make him sad because of her…once again.\nAustin again voiced as he advanced at her, \"...won't you look at me, Val?\"\nValerie flinched and clenched her fist. Tears welled up in her eyes, as she continued to look down.\nRhea, upon finding the right person at the right place, took the cue and stepped back,\n'I no longer need to worry for her…'\nAustin stood beside his lover, before holding her wrist and uttering, \"Please look at me Val…\"\nHis soft voice and the familiar warmth broke her resistance as she turned towards him and rested her head on his chest.\nThe gym, which was previously hearing the screams of her wrath, was now filled with the cries of her agony.\nAustin rubbed her back and continued to whisper, 'It's okay…I am here…'\n—-----**-------\nAustin brought the girl to the stands and heard what happened.\nShe somehow calmed down enough to tell him about the conversation she had with her father.\nAustin knelt before the girl and slowly removed the splinters from her hands. Seeing her blood oozing, made his heart shake. A lump seemed to have grown in his throat that made breathing difficult.\n\"...I don't understand why…why would father ever suggest something….\" Her voice was shaky. Anything that proposes separation from her beloved makes her so painfully hurt and agitated…\nAustin didn't look up at her and took a bottle of disinfectant and cotton from his <Inventory>.\nWhile he cleaned her wounds, he told her, \"You know Val, whenever everything seems like going good in my life, and I find myself being too happy…I always wonder, what if…my greatest source of happiness is snatched away from me?\"\nHis tone was heavy, numerous emotions his voice held.\nForgetting about her grief, the violet-haired heard him saying,\n\"I have thought a few times…what if you get separated from me for some reason…and you know what I saw beyond that possibility?\"\nValerie hesitated, not wanting to hear what he thought, but in the end, curiosity got the better of her, \"What?\"\n\"Nothing.\" Austin raised his face and looked in the eye, \"I saw nothing…just pure blank.\"\nHer eyes slightly stretched, as the burn from the medicine and the pain from her bones seemed insignificant in front of the pain her Darling was showing.\n\"I…cannot imagine a world where I can't live with you. Complete emptiness…I will lose my reason to live. After all, for me, everything starts and ends with you.\"\nValerie gazed at her beloved, a choked sob left her throat, as she heard him saying,\n\"So…even if it's your father, I cannot…I will not let you go, Valerie.\"\n\"Don't…!\" She held his face with her shaky fingers, \"...never let go. Valerie can only belong to her Lord…to you.\"\nTheir arms encircled around each other, and the embrace was more fierce and passionate than ever. It was like the duo was trying to become one with the hug. The very thought of being separated shook them to the core—making them realize what's the most important thing for them.\nAnd that is to always stay together.\n—-----**-------\nAustin cleaned her wounds and wrapped bandages around her knuckles.\n\"Why did you come here instead of meeting me? Hurting yourself because someone else hurt you?\" Austin asked, his tone signifying displeasure.\nValerie, meekly, responded, \"I…didn't want to make you upset by all this…so I thought…\"\n\"So you were intending to hide such a big thing from me? Am I that unreliable, Val?\"\nThe spear-user instantly shook her head, \"No, that's not…! I wasn't going to hide it forever, just for the time being considering the recent events.\"\nAustin was surrounded by challenges that were both mentally and physically taxing. Recently, his friend recovered from a critical situation, and Valerie didn't want to elevate his burden anymore.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Physically, I might not be impressive, but you can trust me when it comes to taking mental pressure. I am good at it.\"\nOnce he finished wrapping up the bandage, he asked, \"There…feels better now?\"\nValerie was about to nod in assent…then something came to her mind, and she shyly shook, \"...still hurts a little.\"\nAustin barely held himself from grinning as he brought her hands near his lips and tenderly kissed them.\n\"Now, is it okay?\"\nValerie smiled, \"Yes, it's better now.\"\n—-----**------\nSitting inside his office room, Aiden read the letter and didn't feel betrayed.\nHe expected this. Valerie is a strong woman who can fight anyone if it comes to Austin.\nBringing the parchment near the candle, he burned the tip of it.\nWatching the burning letter with a malicious grin, he muttered,\n\"It will be fun…this hunt will be more enjoyable, the more you resist.\"\nAs the parchment burned, Aiden thought of his next move, which could detach his little brother from his sole reason for happiness.\n—----**-----\nA/N:- For Valerie, Austin is both her strength and weakness. Well, you all can see how attached they are, so no need to worry about needless separation and shiiii. Thanks for reading, drop a comment.",

Then…\n\"Where am I?\"\n\"In the heavens, child.\" Just as he asked the question, someone called out from his left.\nRudolph turned his head and found a familiar person sitting there.\nWith a weak smile, he uttered, \"Although you are pretty as an angel, it doesn't mean I will get fooled that easily.\"\nHearing those words, Rhea blushed slightly and leaned forward. \"How are you feeling now? Does it still hurt?\" Her voice carried a mix of relief and concern.\nRudolph tried to move his body and indeed, there was some pain in his stomach and legs, \"Kind of. But I know I will recover in a few days.\"\nRhea heaved a sigh, \"No need to rush, the headmaster has already given you a few weeks of leave.\"\nRudolph shrugged, \"The more free time the better. I can use that time to train.\" He doesn't like reading books and remembering things. The only reason he got admitted to Apex Circle was because of his strength.\n\"...hey, Rudolph…I am sorry for what happened back then.\" Hearing Rhea's slow muttering, the raven-haired was surprised,\nHer tone caught him off guard, and he turned to look at her, his brows furrowing. \"Why are you apologizing? It was my mistake for underestimating the enemy and charging in head-on. You don't need to—\"\n\"But-\" she interrupted, \"if I had listened to you and gone after the chanter like you suggested, you wouldn't have gotten hurt. Valerie wouldn't have…\" Her words faltered as she trailed off. \"I feel like it's my fault.\"\nRhea could shake off the feeling that she was, in a way, responsible for Rudolph's situation. After all, he insisted she come and catch the chanter first and let Valerie deal with the monster.\nAnd if Rhea hadn't intervened, Valerie surely would have defeated that being.\nRudolph slowly moved his hand and held hers.\nThe slight connection made her jolt as she heard him saying, \"...you are an idiot to blame yourself for this. You always intended to protect your classmates, and that's not something you should feel shameful about.\"\nWith his face adopting a warm smile, the boy added, \"That's a quality, I admire about you. Never blame yourself for it.\"\nRhea was…stunned.\nIt was strange that days of pondering over the same thing, that if only she had done this or that, was quelled just by a few words of comfort.\nTears welled up in her eyes as Rhea, while wiping them, uttered, \"Okay, I won't blame myself if only you recover soon and get back to the training ground. We have a lot to catch up on.\"\n—----**-----\n*SWISH*\nValerie's eyes widened as she continued to dodge the relentless attacks from her beloved.\nHis precision was sharper, his focus unshaken, and his speed far beyond what she remembered. And not only that,\n**CRACK**\nSeeing the crack forming on the tree where her body was a moment ago, she could tell that his strength had improved as well.\nShe sidestepped, narrowly avoiding the dagger aimed at her. With a swift motion, she twisted his arm upward, forcing his hand open. In the same breath, she spun on her heel, her other hand darting in to snatch the dagger mid-air before it could fall.\n\"Agh!\" Austin winced, disarmed in an instant, as Valerie stepped back, the dagger now firmly in her grasp.\n\"I lost.\" Austin accepted his defeat before Valerie asked,\n\"Does it hurt?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"Nothing to be worried about.\" He rotated his wrist and found it just stinging a little.\n\"I must say, Austin, you have improved quite a lot in so little time. I have noticed that your unnatural growth is linked with the growth of your Shard.\"\nAustin couldn't tell her that it was the system that was allowing him to elevate his stats.\n\"Maybe…\" he shrugged, \"Well, let's get back and get changed?\"\nValerie nodded before they walked back to their respective dorms to change.\nIt has been four days since that incident. After that day, Lord Corwin hasn't contacted Valerie, nor has the girl shown any initiative to send him any letter.\nEn route, he asked the system,\n'Stats.'\n[Combat: 28/100]\n{Next reward at 40}\n[Romance: 42/100]\n{Next reward at 60}\n[Durability: 30/100]\n{Next reward at 40}\n[Trickery: 21/100]\n{Next reward at 35}\n[Overall Progression: 28.5/100]\n…\nHe advanced to the next stage in romance that day when he comforted Valerie in the gym.\nAs a reward, he received a bouquet of ever fragrant flowers, which he naturally gifted to Valerie.\nShe was happy receiving the flowers, to the point she was about to frame them until Austin told her the special thing about the flowers.\n'Hmm….my durability is increasing very slowly. System, assign me a quest.'\n[Are you sure you want to use QoD for your durability enhancement?]\n[Three consecutive failures would cease the Host's authority over QoD.]\nAustin affirmed, \"Yes.\"\n[Ding…]\n[Generating Quest…]\n[Assessing current status…]\n[Ding!]\n[Quest: Endure these challenges to develop your durability:\nDive into water below 0°C for 100 minutes.\nPerform 1,000 push-ups and run 50 km wearing weighted gear of 200kg.\nEndure 50°C heat for 120 minutes.]\n[Reward: +10 Durability, ???]\n[Time limit: 2d 23h 59m]\n\"....\" Austin was…taken aback.\nThis was the second time he demanded a quest and the system has begun showing its sadist side.\n'Well, durability means elevating endurance, so surely, these criteria would help my body to become more sturdy.'\nTo fulfill the challenges, he would need gemstones. Magic beast that gives gemstones cannot be found easily around the Academy, so there was no point trying to find one.\nSo he was left with only one option: buy the necessary equipment.\nAs for the weighted gears, then he would borrow them from the school gymnasium.\nHe didn't have much time, so the workout part would need to be divided into two parts. And the endurance part would be done on alternative days.\n*Knock*\n\"Young master.\" Hearing the voice from the other end, Austin got up from the bed and approached the door.\nWhile reading the necessity, Austin had taken a bath and changed his clothes, so there was no rush.\n\"Good morning, Sebastian.\" Exchanging greetings with the butler, Austin was headed towards his office.\nEn route, Austin asked, \"Can you bring me three Ice and three Fire Gemstones of the Third grade?\"\nSebastian politely responded, \"Understood; I will deliver it by tomorrow.\"\nAustin hummed before he and the butler walked inside the office.\nSebastian, upon finding them no longer in the range of being heard by others, spoke, \"Young Master, I have some news to share regarding the Capital.\"\nAustin's brows rose. \"What news?\"\nSebastian informed, \"Recently, an emergency meeting was arranged. The situation with the kingdom in the far south looks dire.\"\nAustin frowned; there are seven major nations on the human side. And the nation of the far south was the second strongest country when it came to military strength.\nEryndor was strong but if only its allies keep supporting the kingdom.\nEryndor was the heart of trade that's why four nations are in alliance with Eryndor. That's why, until now, the nation in the South hasn't done anything against Eryndor, despite their past grudges.\nBut now, 'Hener must have pulled their hands…' The greatest supplier of military supplies, the kingdom of Hener, would surely now backstab Eryndor.\nReason? Parkinson.\n'Has the plot shifted?' Austin turned towards Sebastian, before asking,\n\"Can you find out what was discussed in that meeting?\"\nSebastian seemed hesitant, \"For that, I will need to visit the Capital.\"\n\"Then please do so. I need to know if a war is approaching.\"\nSebastian lowered his head, \"As you command, sir.\"\n—----**------\nSoon, Austin left the office, heading toward the school.\nThe situation with the capital was still unclear, so he didn't ponder over it needlessly and decided to reach the rendezvous point on time.\nValerie was waiting for him there, however, unlike usual, there was no smile on her face.\nAustin approached her, \"Is everything good?\"\nValerie smiled instantly seeing him, as she nodded, \"Yes, I am fine.\" Taking out a parchment, she showed him, \"I just got this from Miss Norma.\"\nAustin frowned slightly upon hearing the name, as he asked, \"If I am not wrong, she is the secretary of your father?\"\n\"Yes, she is. I asked her to give me the list of people who contacted father before he came to meet me. I asked her to keep it a secret from father, but even if he finds out, he won't mind.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"Did you suspect something?\"\nThe violette nodded, \"And my suspicion was right.\"\nShe pointed at the specific name of the person who came to meet Lord Corwon, just two days before he arrived at the Academy.\n'The first Prince, Eryndor Aiden.'\n—-----**-------\nA/N:- I hope you all are enjoying the story so far.

      "content": "Chapter 58: Chapter 57- Aiden\nAiden. Someone who was separated from his parents around his birth. His upbringing was in an orphanage. A place where the boy got to learn various things, which surely, someone his age shouldn't have.\nAt the age of five, he learned that if he wanted to eat to survive, then he had to be strong. But because he was weak, his bread always got snatched by the taller and soldier kids.\nThe warden of the place never said anything, so Aiden learned that begging for others help was futile.\nHe always had to pick from the garbage bin or work overtime to eat a piece of bread. Washing dishes, brushing toilets, cleaning drainage pipes...doing all those nasty things that everyone avoided. And all for a piece of bread so he could survive.\nHe even tried stealing, but on his first attempt, he was caught and received a punishment which gives him nightmares to this date.\nBy the time he turned seven and became strong enough to show dominance, his house—the orphanage—got snatched away as a newly appointed noble decided to demolish the orphanage and build a bar there.\nThat was the second lesson of his life—strength is not only the thing required. You need money as well. And until you have the two you can take anything away from anyone.\nBy the age of thirteen, he was working at a brothel. He used to clean rooms and drive away the problem customers. Slum and poverty had allowed him to learn a few techniques with a stick, so he was fairly strong for his age.\nWhen he was there, he fell for a woman who used to work as a prostitute for the brothel.\nAiden didn't have a problem with her job but he was determined to liberate her. She was initially resistant, calling herself impure and not his worth. However, Aiden said something that completely changed her mind,\n'The only time I can actually smile...or feel the warmth of a family, is when I am with you. Please, never abandon me, Mary.' in the end, she agreed.\nAs such, he began doing several jobs a day, barely getting any sleep, and even neglected food. He cut the cost in every single way possible—picking garbage again for his body requirement.\nHowever, the day he earned enough money to liberate his first love—his Marilyn...she was...she was killed by one of her customers.\nThat was the day, Aiden learned his third lesson.\nAiden...sat there, in front of her grave, for two days. Without sleep, without food. He just stared at her name, and like the falling snowflakes, he found all his dreams and feelings falling and disappearing after crashing against the ground.\nAfter two and a half days, when Aiden got up from the ground, there was a glowing sword in his hand.\nLooking half-dead, the boy advanced across the snowy field and didn't pause until he reached a certain mansion.\nHe slaughtered everyone and everything that came in his path. It was pure horror to see a weak man killing people here and there as he advanced toward the one who killed Marilyn.\n\"Pl-Please...d-don't kill me...I didn't know that she...s-she would die....\"\nAiden smirked a smile that formed for the first time on his face after Marilyn's death before he swung his Shard.\nThe noble was split in half, his eyes still widened, and the last thing the dying man heard was,\n\"Sorry...I also didn't know...that this will kill you.\"\nThat day...Aiden didn't slaughter that man who took Marilyn's life but also killed all his emotions.\nThat incident taught him a very valuable lesson; if you want to survive in this world, you need to snatch from people.\nTake things away from them, that's the only way.\n.....\nAustin is aware of the First Prince's back story, and he genuinely sympathizes with him.\nHe has gone through experiences that no one ever should go through. He was snatched away from his food, house, and love.\nAnd when he returned to the capital, he instantly considered Austin his enemy.\nAfter all, in Aiden's eyes, Austin had hogged everything and everyone that belonged to Aiden.\nThat's why, Aiden decided to take everything away from him.\nHis parents, his status as the First Prince, his fame, and now ..\n'He is after the person who matters the most to me. Yeah, he is dead.' Austin doesn't give a crap about what he went through. Until it was about his parents and the throne, Austin didn't mind.\nBut now that Aiden has turned his disgusting gaze towards Valerie....nu-uh, Austin isn't going to let it slide.\n'Aiden needs to disappear.'\nCanonically, Aiden gets infatuated with Rhea since Austin shows interest in her. And because of his obsession to obtain Rhea, his evil plans get exposed, and so does his mind-washing skill—Persuasive Tongue.\n'Hmm...presently, he has already built himself quite a reputation in the council and his impression of the King' is quite strong as well.'\nAustin couldn't just stay idle and do nothing about it. He has to get rid of Aiden somehow. And for that, he needs to expose his evil plans.\n'Tch....but he doesn't start the slave trade any time soon...and other than there is no other way to expose him.' In the future, Rhea exposes his human trafficking, and that leads to the revelation of his skill and then and then...\nBut as of now, Austin couldn't think of any route to expose Aiden. And that bastard is so sick in the head, that coercing him wouldn't do any good.\n'Should I take help from Sebastian and kill—no, Sebastian wouldn't kill the First Prince unless I give him some reason to do so.'\nLost in his thoughts, he never noticed when the Professor was standing before him.\n\"Austin.\"\n\"Ah, yes.\" He instantly shot his eyes toward the board, and answered, \"The left ear.\"\nPeople around him were astounded to see the quick response to the question even though, it was obvious that he wasn't paying attention to the class.\nThe teacher sighed, \"I was about to suggest you open the window if you want, but well, that's the correct answer.\"\nThe students chuckled hearing that before the teacher returned to the podium.\nValerie had a concerned look on her face. She was well aware of the reason behind his distraction.\nAlthough she was feeling bad about giving him another reason to worry, Valerie didn't regret her decision.\nThis situation with Aiden needs to be dealt with, and only her Lord could think of a way to eradicate that piece of junk.\n.....\nNot so long after the lunch break arrived, the students began walking towards the common hall to get some much-needed break.\nRhea, who was about to walk in a different direction, was interrupted by Austin, \"Going to the infirmary?\"\nThe pinkhead turned around and found Valerie and Austin standing there.\nSmilingly, she nodded, \"Yeah. He will get discharged soon.\"\n\"Yes, I know. But shouldn't you first eat something?\"\nRhea was rendered speechless ...she looked down and said, \"I feel Rudolph must be getting bored so-\"\n\"But he won't like it as well if you get sick while taking care of him,\" Austin added, making Rhea realize that she might be exerting herself a little too much.\nValerie rolled her eyes, \"The guilt and regret.\"\nRhea pouted, \"Hey! Can you be a little sympathetic?\"\nValerie shrugged, \"If you understand what I am saying, then move on. No one is blaming you.\"\nSaying so, she pulled Austin's sleeve, urging him to say, \"Well, see you later.\"\nOnce they were out of sight, Valerie asked, \"What do you think? Should we inform Father?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"Nope if we do, Lord Corwon would think I am manipulating you.\"\nValerie frowned, \"Why would he-oh.\" She then realized. If she called Aiden evil, without any evidence, surely her father would think that Austin has manipulated her out of jealousy.\nAustin nodded, \"Yes, so we should keep the information to us. And when I say 'us' I am not even involving Sebastian.\"\nValerie was startled, \"But didn't he swear loyalty to you?\"\nAustin nodded, \"He did, but as the man who has served my father and the nation for so long, my action against Aiden would seem like usurpation.\nValerie grew concerned, \"Doing things without his support or letting him notice would be quite difficult.\"\nSebastian is an observant man, someone who pays close attention to Austin and the people around him. Naturally, if they plot against the First Prince, the butler would find out about it sooner than later.\nAustin nodded, as he settled the food trays on the table and ushered Valerie to take a seat.\n\"Directly attacking Aiden would be difficult and risky, that's why we are going to do something that will agitate him to no end?\"\nValerie frowned. She originally thought that they would just go to the Capital and secretly assassinate the stem of this problem. However, now that she heard his words, she realized that it would be too hasty.\nUnlike Austin, who had already picked up his spoon and was scooping some soup, Valerie's focus was still on her Lord as she asked, \"What?\"\nAustin first tasted the delicious soup, before he told her, \"We will snatch something from him, which Aiden dearly treasures.\"\nWith a thin grin, Austin added, \"His dreams for the throne.\"\n---------**-------\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed reading the chapter.

      "content": "Chapter 59: Chapter 58- First Step\nCedric has been quite busy these days. The situation with the Southern nation is very critical.\nThe news of weakening ties with the Hener Kingdom sent a clear signal to the world: the Eryndor Kingdom was no longer the formidable power it once was.\nThose who have been greedy to obtain all the riches of Eryndor suddenly started to act up. However, Eryndor still has the support of two major kingdoms, so they won't attack Eryndor solely for claiming their treasury.\nHowever, a specific kingdom doesn't follow the same thought process as the others, and their reason for attacking Eryndor is completely different as well.\n\"If they attack us now it would be mayhem.\" Cedric heaved a sigh as he looked older than his age with his face adopting a worrisome expression.\nThe nation in the South—Drenovar has strong military resources, fearsome Generals, and advanced artifacts that could grant them victory against Eryndor unless Hener supports them during the time of war.\nHowever, considering the situation with the Prince of Hener, it was highly unlikely they would show their support when Eryndor would need them the most.\nCedric received advice from the Council to have a talk with Hener's King regarding the matter. However, Cedric immediately rejected the proposal. He will not negotiate with the nation, whose heir tried to kill his son.\nSpeaking about Austin, Cedric recently received a letter from Headmaster Philius, regarding the incident with the Demon.\nA proud smile bloomed on his face as he read the letter again, feeling his chest puffing with pride as he read how Austin gallantly fought against the inhumane and won without any external support.\nAustin has shown his wits and strength to capture the Demons and save his friends.\n'You have turned into such a fine young man, Austin. Your father is proud of you...' With a smile of contentment, Cedric fell asleep on his working chair.\n---------**--------\n\"So the war is inevitable,\" Austin muttered as he sat in his office and heaved a sigh after hearing the backstory that he already knew.\nThe country in the South once had a good relationship with Eryndor. They used to be trading partners and before Hener, Eryndor used to receive military supplies from Drenovar.\nHowever, two decades ago, when the Queen and the King came to Eryndor to join the harvest celebration, a group of assassins attacked the two royalties and killed them in the room they were staying in.\nNaturally, questions arose about how assassins entered the most secure establishment of Eryndor. And in no time, those questions turned into allegations.\nAt that time, if not for the Union Council, Eryndor might have been erased from the map.\nHowever, even though the situation was settled, the flames of revenge have yet to be subdued.\nAnd now that Hener, the biggest backer of Eryndor has pulled their hands, Drenovar would surely find a way to attack Eryndor. And this time, it's highly unlikely for the Union to interfere.\n\"My Lord, if the war breaks out, it is highly likely that the Academy will be suspended.\"\nAustin nodded, \"And the Council would declare Valorian Academy ineligible to participate.\" The council that arranged the tournament works under the Union Council.\nThis war would not only affect the natural progression of the story but also would restrict Austin's movement. And if things come to it, Valerie would be forced to the frontlines, given her position as one of the strongest warriors of Eryndor.\nNo, that was unacceptable. This war would ruin many things, and Austin doesn't like the idea of letting Valerie get involved with it.\n\"Sebastian, we need to stop this war from happening.\"\nSebastian's eyes stretched in shock, \"But sir, what can we-\"\n\"We need to find a way to not only erase their hostile intentions but also make Drenovar our ally.\"\nSebastian was at a loss for words. While his Lord had honed his skills remarkably in just a few days, and his strategies had proven flawless so far, this situation was different. It involved the delicate balance between two kingdoms, where a single misstep could result in thousands of deaths and the fall of Eryndor.\n\"My Lord...as your server, I cannot stop you, but as an advisor, I would suggest you not involve yourself with this matter.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"You want me not to do anything and let them destroy the kingdom that my ancestors built against all resistance?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"No, Sebastian. I may not be the first choice for the throne, but that doesn't mean I will just sit here and let them annihilate my birthland.\"\nSebastian was touched by his words. His heart rate elevated seeing his Lord being so devoted to his nation. At this age when children mostly remain busy making connections and thinking about their future, Austin was worried about his motherland.\nKneeling before his Lord, the grey-haired man uttered, \"Please don't hesitate to ask my help in any manner, sir. This loyal servant would sacrifice his life for you to fulfill your goal.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh of relief. Thankfully, he was able to convince Sebastian.\nAlthough he was determined to stop this war, Austin's main reason was to threaten Aiden's position as the next King. And knowing that assho*e Austin knew, in desperation and panic, he would make a mistake.\n'This is my first step towards your downfall, Aiden.'\n---------**--------\nThe next morning, Austin and Valerie were sitting side by side on the resting bench nearly at six.\nThey have been sparring for the past two hours and that was quite surprising for Valerie, \"Your stamina has increased.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"That's so? But I started training with weighted gears just yesterday.\"\nValerie was taken aback, \"You are training after school?\"\nAustin nodded, \"Yeah, just for an hour after school I have started training in the gym. That's why, you can be rest assured about my stamina.\"\nThe way he smiled near the end made Valerie realize what he was talking about.\n*Puff*\nSteams erupted from her head, as she leaned her head down and fidgeted at her place.\nAustin chuckled, seeing her reaction as he leaned toward his beloved.\nSoon they returned to their respective rooms to prepare for the school.\n-------**------\n\"I have news to share.\" It was early in the morning when all the students gathered in the classroom and the teacher arrived not so long after\nHearing her words, everyone quieted down, and a sense of tension spread in the classroom. After all, whenever the teacher gave them any news it always was unpleasant and disturbing.\nBut today,\n\"The trials for the tournament would start next week.\"\nA round of gasps erupted in the classroom, and one of the students asked, \"This soon?\"\nThe older one nodded, \"Yes, this early. As you all know, we select the best students from each year to participate in the tournament. We need to first set up the trials to select those special students who would be representing the academy.\"\nTaking a pause and after ensuring that every eye was on her she added, \"There will be three rounds of trials—starting from one on one duel between the participants. It's your choice in which division you want to participate in but if you are planning to enter the tournament as an Elite, you must have the tag of a B-rank.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh; although he knew it, hearing it from the teacher made him a bit nervous.\nHe just broke into C-rank after his battle with Kalwar, and now, he has like two months before the tournament officially begins.\n'I need to continue with my quest and fight a few beasts. Thankfully, there is no limit to QoD.' Austin decided to rely on the system as much as he could for this tournament.\n\"Is there anything anyone wants to ask?\" The teacher asked, and Austin instantly shot his hand up, \"Yes, Austin?\"\nThe blond Prince got up, and under everyone's gaze, he asked, \"For the trials of the Elite tier, does one need to be a B-rank even for that?\"\nMany eyebrows rose upon hearing that. There were a few who openly smirked and scoffed at his question. It was not a hidden fact that Austin was a D-rank and the weakest one in the class at that. From him, this question sounded nothing less than a joke.\nHowever, their smirk faded when suddenly they felt an ominous presence from a certain desk; reminding them that the one standing beside Austin was none other than the strongest student of the academy.\nThe Professor heaved a sigh, \"Even if there is no rule, what would be the point in participating in the Elite trials when no one can grow their stats in just a month?\"\nAustin smiled and told her, \"Thank you, ma'am.\" He didn't need any further information.\nHe has a week to prepare for the trials and a month for the tournament. Was it difficult? Yes. But was it impossible? Hell, nah.\n-------**------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 60: Chapter 59- Not interested?\nSitting inside the cold water, Austin closed his eyes and allowed his mind to attain some peace.\nHe was using the Gemstones that Sebastian brought for him to turn the temperature of the water beyond the resistance point. Although it was a little uncomfortable in the beginning, by the fifteenth minute, he could not feel his muscles at all, so it was all good.\n'I used to take an ice bath in the past, but now it's all a distant memory...' In his last life, there was a time when Luke was intensely immersed in sports and martial arts. His life was going well, and his body was at its peak state.\nHowever, then came the relationship, then his time and focus moved from sports, and he ended up ruining everything. Thankfully, Valerie is the kind of girl who not only helps him maintain his health but also her hard work and discipline motivates him.\nThinking about the future, a name resounded in his head as Austin thought of a plan.\n'The Elysian Elixir.'\nHe has currently given Sebastian the task of knowing more about Drenovar's situation and how they can exploit their shortcomings for their benefit.\nHowever, it was just to keep Sebastian in good faith that Austin asked him to collect information. For someone who has played the game until the end(nearly), Austin knows the situation with Drenovar.\nThe King of the nation had fallen sick and was suffering from an incurable disease. He was counting his final days, and before his death, he wanted to bring down the nation and avenge his grandparents.\nCanonically, Rhea luckily comes across the elixir, and later, when she meets the King of Drenovar, she feeds him the medicine and saves Eryndor from its possible demise.\nHowever, it happens a lot later since, canonically, Hener doesn't remove their support from Eryndor this soon. It was the involvement of Aiden with them in human trafficking that disturbs the alliance and later gives Drenovar the opportunity.\n'I need to take care of Drenovar before the tournament. I have a feeling that they have already started their preparation...'\nThe heirs of Drenovar always give their family, the utmost priority. Taking revenge for the late Emperor and Empress is their primary goal...however, if Austin saves the current king from his agony, surely,\n'They would be indebted to the rescuer.'\nNow the problem was to search for the elixir in the vast forest of Eryndor. He knows the general location but the exact coordinates slipped his mind. However, Austin knows that if he reaches the place, he will be able to pinpoint it.\n*Knock*\n\"Young master,\" Sebastian called from the other side, making Austin realize that he might have overdone it.\n\"Ah, yes. Wait a minute.\" He took out the gemstone and used the other one to melt the ice.\nPushing himself up, he removed his numb body from the water before wiping his body and changing his clothes.\n*Click*\nHe found Sebastian preparing the tea on one side and a file resting on the bed\nAustin stepped forward took the file, and read through the report.\n\"Hmm...haven't been seen for the past three weeks in the courtroom. No hunting trips, not even attending the birthday celebration of his daughter.\"\nSebastian returned to his master while holding the tray, as he muttered, \"In my knowledge, sir, Your Majesty Zaydan is either gravely injured or ill.\" Sebastian was also aware of the close bond the family shares; as such, under normal circumstances, it would have been impossible for the King to not attend his only daughter's birthday.\nAustin hummed as he picked up the cup and settled down. He has a plan and knows that he can execute it; it's just he lacks manpower and resources.\nHe has three thousand gold coins in total, which he has been saving for a few months. Also, Sebastian knows a few important people who could help them reach Drenovar safely.\n\"I just hope my preliminary matches happen early.\"\nSebastian commented, \"You need to face the first round and then you would be provided with half a month of free time for the second round. After all, the whole school participates in this.\"\nAustin nodded, \"That's why I just want them to put my name first on the list.\"\nSebastian advised, \"Maybe you can ask Headmaster Philius for help? Naturally, after what you have done for the Academy, he wouldn't reject your request.\"\nAustin smiled, \"That's a great idea.\" He would just make some excuse that he needs to return home for some business and get himself a few days off under the pretense.\nSebastian gave him a short bow and said, \"I will be leaving now,\"\nAustin was surprised, \"So suddenly? You can stay here and finish the tea first.\"\nSebastian raised his brows, and with a faint smile, he asked, \"Do you really want me to stay, young lord?\"\nAustin was perplexed, as he parted his mouth to ask what he was talking about when suddenly,\n*Knock* *Knock*\nAustin paused....blushed, and got up, \"O-Okay, you may go now.\"\nSebastian gave a slight bow to the gentleman and the lady before making his way out of the room.\nAustin took a deep breath and turned towards the window.\nThere, he saw a face that made his heart race and calmed his nerves at the same time.\nHe opened the window and offered his hand to the girl, \"Good evening, my lovely lady.\"\nValerie smiled shyly as she responded, \"Good evening...did I disturb you?\"\nShe noticed just after the moment she knocked that her Lord was discussing something with Sebastian. But it was too late to think.\n\"No, not at all. We weren't talking about anything serious.\" He held her bag and led the lady inside.\nAs Valerie sat on the bed, Austin rested her bag on the chair and said, \"I will prepare some tea for you.\"\nValerie shook her head, \"No, it's okay.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"You sure?\" Getting a nod from her, Austin sat down on the chair across from her and asked, \"So you wanted to study together?\"\n\"Yes. There is a written test in two days, and I want to keep up with others.\"\nValerie wasn't bad in academics, but Austin was just too brilliant for a comparison.\nHe has a very sharp mind and impressive memory.\nAustin nodded before he asked, \"Then let's get started.\"\nValerie nodded and soon joined Austin at the table.\nAustin opened the book and began flipping through the pages where she had doubts.\nSince the mathematics of this world was quite undeveloped, he used the methods he learned back on earth and utilized his naturally sharp mind for calculations.\n\"So yeah...you need to add this...\"\nWhile Austin was explaining the method, Valerie continued to glance at him every once in a while.\n'Is he really not...' She had read many romance novels and realized something very crucial about their relationship.\nEven though they are so close, alone in his room, Austin never shows any sign of having any of 'those' thoughts for her.\nValerie isn't a hasty girl who wants to do those things that only a couple should do after marriage, but still...it was a little disheartening to see her Lord being completely fine even when they are so close.\n'This is bad...does My Lord only have platonic feelings for me...' The thought continued to poke at her, and she wasn't able to focus on the question at all.\n\"Okay, tell me.\" Valerie was startled when suddenly, Austin closed the book and turned to look at her.\nShe shook her head, \"N-Nothing.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Look Val, I know you enough to tell that unless something is troubling you, you won't neglect my words.\"\nValerie was rendered speechless; she was now regretting thinking about it when her Lord was so focused on teaching her.\nAnd now that she has already wasted his time so much, she didn't hide the matter, \"I...I feel you aren't interested in me...as in that way.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"You mean to say, I am not sexually interested in you? That I don't find you attractive?\"\nValerie's cheeks were flushed, but she nodded, with her head leaning forward.\nAustin exhaled a long breath. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he revealed, \"Every day, thirty minutes of meditation in the morning before meeting you, and thirty minutes at night so I can control my emotion in front of you, Val. It's not like I don't find you attractive, I just fear that my action might hurt you.\"\nValerie was stunned to hear that, as she asked, \"Y-You do that daily...?\"\nAustin nodded, \"Yes of course, otherwise,\" Leaning closer to her ear, he sensually whispered, \"...nothing in this world could have stopped me from knowing how loud my Val can be in bed.\"\nHis hot breath, coupled with those words were too much for the maiden-hearted Valerie. And as a result,\n\"...*faints*\"\n--------**-------\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed reading the story. I am taking their relationship slowly since I am giving both of them time to realise their feelings(especially Austin).\nDrop a comment.",

Young Master Park hasn't left his room ever since he returned. He barely eats anything or answers to anyone.\"\nZurkis took a long breath and then his mind went to the reason for his son's current condition.\nWith his turning frosty, he asked, \"Abel…tell me, are you sure Park was framed?\"\nThe Prime Minister's expression turned grim as he affirmed, \"I had a thorough conversation with Professor Morkel…he has been supporting Your Highness Park during his stay at the Academy.\"\nTaking a pause, he added, \"And according to him, Your Highness Park usually prefers to hunt and instantly kill his prey. Surely, he has an animosity against Prince Austin, but that doesn't mean Your Highness Park would take such a risky decision of not killing him right away rather than torturing him.\"\nZurkis nodded, \"I have taught him so I know he won't torture someone whom he hates. Just slit their throat and end the chapter.\"\nInterlocking his fingers, he leaned forward, and added, \"That means someone plotted against my son…and then framed him.\"\nAbel nodded, \"It seems to be the case, my Lord.\"\nZurkis remained silent for a moment, before he uttered, \"Butchering the Prince, who became the reason for my son's condition, would not be sufficient. We need to eradicate his home, his family, and everyone he loves-\"\n\"Father…\" Zurkis paused, as he heard a familiar voice from the entrance of the room.\nWith his eyes widened, he hurriedly got up, \"Park?\"\nThe same lanky young man was looking excessively thin and pale, in comparison to the last time Zurkis saw him.\nParkinson's eyes were drawn to the ground, as he muttered, \"I want to meet her…\"\nZurkis was baffled about whom he was talking about, when suddenly, Abel stepped forward and whispered, \"The girl Your Highness is infatuated with. Rhea.\"\nZurkis remembered hearing about the girl from Parkinson, through the letters in the past as well. The only reason why Parkinson decided to stay at Eryndor, even though he initially went there as an exchange student was because of her.\nZurkis rested his hand on Parkinson's shoulder and said, \"Look son, there are only two ways of meeting her; first, kidnap her and bring her here. Second, infiltrate Eryndor and meet her in secrecy. However, the second option is risky so as your father, I will suggest otherwise.\"\nParkinson bit his lips; just to meet the love of his life he needs to commit a crime now, huh?\nAbel stepped forward and said, \"There is a third way, as well, my Lord.\"\nAbel suggested, \"We can offer alliance to Eryndor if they agree to marry Rhea to our Young L-\"\n\"And get myself a lifetime's worth of hatred.\" Parkinson spat, his eyes made the Prime Minister shiver.\n\"Son? Is she that strong-headed?\"\nParkinson's eyes softened, as he said, \"She is a woman of strict ideals, and I don't want to start my life with her through underhanded methods.\"\nZurkis heaved a sigh as he cupped his son's face before asking, \"Tell me, what do you want to do, son? Unless it risks the lives of my people, I can do everything for you.\"\nParkinson thought for a moment, before asking, \"Can I…get a spot in the Avron academy with a fake identity?\"\nAvron Academy was the central academy of Hener. Hearing that Parkinson wanted to return there made Zurkis baffled, \" But why with a fake identity?\"\nAbel answered that for him, \"Because the young master wants to participate in the tournament and meet Miss Rhea through it.\"\nNow Zurkis realized his true motive.\nPatting his shoulder proudly, the man muttered, \"Do whatever you want, son. You have my full support!\"\nParkinson grinned hearing that, 'Wait for me Rhea….I will meet you and clear all the misunderstandings…'\n—------**--------\n\"Okay then, line up with your partner, and wait for your turn.\"\nIt was during the physical training class that the students of Apex Circle in the second year and Brilliance Crest in the third year were grouped in the gymnasium.\nToday, a joint training was arranged to let the students know more about teaming up with those with whom they are not so familiar.\nIn the tournament, they need to participate with their fellow schoolmates, given not only the Apex Circle would be participating in the tournament.\nIn the second round of the Elite division, where students need to participate as a duo, they cannot be choosy. The best need to pair with the best, regardless of which section or year they belong to.\nThe students were paired up according to their ranking, that is, the first ranker of Apex Circle was with the first ranker of Brilliance Crest, and so on.\nAustin was paired up with a guy with pale yellow hair and freckles on his face. His back was slightly hunched, and from his demeanor, he seemed underconfident.\nAustin glanced at Valerie and found a super energetic guy with pale green hair, standing beside her.nHe was trying his best to talk to Valerie with his eyes sparkling. However, despite all the efforts, Valerie wasn't uttering a single word.\n…\n\"So I watched it, and my friends said if you keep following his path and methods, you will also land into Apex Circle next year…\"\nValerie suddenly reacted to his words, making the boy feel that she was finally taking an interest.\nHowever, when he noticed her gaze traveling past him, he frowned in confusion.\nTurning his head, he found the center of her attention and realized that she wasn't even listening to him.\n'Seriously, what she sees in him…isn't he just a useless Prince with narcissistic tendencies?'\nValerie, unaware of the other one's thoughts, smiled at her beloved.\n'Do your best!' She cheered for him.\n…\n\"Instructor, isn't it boring to just battle without a prize? How about we add a bet.\"\nThe instructor of the Brilliance Crest suggested as he stepped forward, \"Offering something at the cost of loss is a very good source of motivation for the students.\"\nThe female instructor of Apex Circle shrugged, \"If the bet is within rules then I have no problem with that.\"\nThe other one grinned, before ushering, \"We will start from the first pair; Valerie and Blaze, step forward.\"\nThe green-haired boy grinned as he ushered, \"After you, lady.\"\nValerie didn't react and just walked towards the arena.\nEveryone was quite hyped for this battle. It was said that Blaze was quite a talented warrior, however, because of the restriction he put on himself, he couldn't get himself a seat in the Apex Circle.\n\"The best versus the best.\" One of the students muttered.\n\"We will finally see the Pride of Valor struggling against someone.\"\n\"Haah~her cold look is so exciting. Step on me, mommy~\"\n\"Dude, you need to chill…\"\nThe murmuring from the crowd was ignored as the two participants stood while facing each other.\nThe third-year's instructor stated, \"No killing, no attack that can leave lasting damage. Remember, this is just a friendly spar.\"\nBlaze smirked as he said, \"About the bet, sir, if I win, I want you to go on a date with me, Miss Valerie.\"\n\"Oooooh~\"\n\"Blaze got guts, eh!\"\n\"Say yes, say yes!\"\nCompletely ignoring the fact that Valerie has a fiancée, Blaze suggested.\nValerie's expression turned frosty, the whole gymnasium felt the shiver as snow began forming around the arena.\nTurning her attention to the Instructor, making the older one flinch, she asked, \"What is the punishment for crippling my opponent, sir?\"\nThe chattering of the audience and the smirk on Blaze's face disappeared upon hearing those words.\nEveryone who has seen Valerie in action before, that's why they know that the girl might not be lying.\nRhea was shaking her head, as she muttered,\n'Only target Austin if you want to suicide.'\nThe instructor responded in a grim voice, \"Expulsion from the Academy, and possible imprisonment.\"\nValerie nodded before she turned towards her opponent and muttered to herself, \"So I need to stop just before making him cripple huh?\"\nHearing those words, Blaze's fist clenched as he said, \"Aren't you too confident in yourself?\"\nValerie didn't respond; she had already considered herself facing an insect, and as such, she found it nonsensical to reply to those buzzes.\nThe Instructor of the first year was a little anxious to let this spar take place but it was already too late,\n\"Begin!\"\nBlaze instantly summoned his Soul Shard and was about to lunge at Valerie, only to realize,\n\"Huh?\" The man found himself completely immobile with his feet encased in a thick layer of ice.\nValerie didn't summon her Shard; rather, she stepped forward while cracking her knuckles and looking at Blaze with nothing but pure indifference.\nAustin chuckled, and with a shake of his head, he muttered, 'He is about to experience a world of pain.'\n—------**-------\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed reading the chapter.

      "content": "Chapter 62: Chapter 61- Lester\nThe third-year student, Blaze, was taken to the infirmary after the 'friendly spar'. He wasn't crippled, or any lasting damage was dealt; however, receiving several blows, to the face no less, by an S-rank whose expertise lies in combat was, surely, would be too much for the man.\nSomething that everyone was surprised by was the fact that Rhea lost her battle against the barrier user. She lost her cool in the middle and lost her steam by the third minute as well; leading to an easy victory for her opponent.\nAustin was...slightly concerned after witnessing the battle. She should have been able to defeat her opponent and also made some connections with her second Shard. However, the cross-bow she wields is just a decoration to her, giving her the label of 'Dual-wielder' and nothing more.\n'I cannot help her train, but surely can give a few tips.' It was an undeniable fact that against the final boss, Rhea was a great asset. Valerie was strong and there were a few more who would be actively participating in the war. However, there were several Generals as well who needed to be dealt with.\nRhea, the chosen one, cannot fall behind and remain in the shadows. Although Austin knows that he has snatched a few chances of her progression, she shouldn't have lost her true motivation to become stronger.\n\"Austin and Lester, step onto the stage.\" Hearing the instructor's voice, Austin and the other guy walked forward.\nSince it was the end of the class, many people were yawning and wanting to return to their dorms.\n\"We need to watch the bottom feeders as well, now?\"\n\"The lowest of the low...\"\n\"I wish I could dip in a warm bath already...\"\n\"Now they will fruitlessly put effort to make this match look exciting and tough.\"\nSeveral opinions were flying in their direction, and looking at how Lester was hiding his face from the crowd, Austin assumed he was being affected by their comments.\n\"Don't limit yourself because they expect us to finish fast, okay?\" Austin urged as they stood facing each other in the arena.\nEvery battle, every spar matters to his growth, as such, Austin didn't want to let others ruin it for him.\nLester took a strong gulp, as he said, \"Please don't hurt me too much. My mum gets worried if she sees me injured.\"\nAustin was baffled hearing that. However, he never got the chance to ask anything as the instructor barked,\n\"Begin!\"\nAustin placed his hand behind his back and summoned his WhisperWing, making it seem he was taking it out from behind.\n\"Woah, no Shard but an old school boomerang?\"\n\"The guy got style and a bird brain to think he can defeat a third year with that.\"\n\"But it's Lester we are talking about.\"\nIgnoring the murmurs of the crowd, Austin hurled WhisperWing toward Lester, aiming for his head. If it landed, the blow would create the perfect opening.\nThe boomerang tore through the air, a blur of motion slicing toward its target.\nAustin's vision sharpened as he summoned his Soul Shard, every second stretching like an eternity. He couldn't afford to underestimate Lester—not even as the lowest-ranked.\nBut something felt off.\n'What the…?'\nLester, fully aware of the approaching boomerang, calmly lifted his hood, pulling it over his head with agonizing slowness.\nTen feet.\nAustin gripped his Shard and stepped forward, and time seemed to crawl. WhisperWing was inches away from colliding with Lester's forehead.\nAnd then—\n*ZAP*\nLester vanished into thin mist. The boomerang soared through empty space, its sharp whistle fading into silence.\n\"What?!\" Austin skidded to a halt, scanning the arena. His heart pounded. Did Lester have some kind of vanishing skill like Kalwar?\nHis answer came fast.\n*SHLINK!*\nA thin line of pain flared on Austin's shoulder. His eyes widened as a shadow blurred past him with unnatural speed.\nLester.\nThe realization hit like a hammer.\n'A speedster.'\nBlood trickled down Austin's arm. His pulse roared in his ears as he turned, bracing for the next strike.\nAustin spun on his heel, scanning the arena with razor-sharp focus. His instincts screamed danger, but his eyes barely caught the flickers of Lester darting around him, faster than his body could keep up.\nAnother blur.\n*SWISH!*\nA shallow gash opened across his ribs. Austin hissed, staggering back, gripping his Soul Shard tighter. Blood seeped into his shirt, but he forced himself to stay on his feet.\nHe sharpened his senses, watching for even the faintest sign of movement.\nA gust of wind to his left. He twisted, raising his Shard defensively—too slow.\nSLASH!\nThis time, a thin cut appeared on his thigh. His knees buckled slightly, but he caught himself before hitting the ground.\n\"Goddamn! Lester at it! He is upholding the honor of Brilliance Crest!\"\n\"Lester is going brutal. Not finishing the battle but inflicting small wounds. Wicked~\"\n\"Is he toying with Austin? Woah, woah, woah, you're gonna anger a certain someone, lad.\"\nRhea bit her lips seeing Austin being completely helpless against the speedster. Even she cannot keep up with his movement because of his tendency to remain completely out of any pattern.\nValeria balled her fist, but there was no other reaction detectable from her.\nAustin calmed his mind and assessed the situation. Thanks to his increased durability, he was still in the condition to think rationally.\n'He is going to the far end of the arena and returning to attack me.' Austin could trace the guy however, his reaction speed was too slow to attack or defend himself.\nHolding his Shard above his head, he increased the size to the point that both ends touched the rim of the arena.\n\"Woah! Augmentation?\"\n\"That size is unreal for a last ranker.\"\n\"His size is making me wet...ahh~\"\nAustin's trick worked; Lester finally had to bring himself to a halt, or he would have collided with the Shard that had perfectly divided the arena into two.\n\"Wing!\" Austin called out, and in the next instance Lester found something advancing toward him\n**CRACK**\nHowever, it was too late. Before the speedster could react, the boomerang hit him on the back of his head, pushing his head forward from his body and drawing blood from his nose.\nAnd it wasn't it, as the speedster suddenly found his hair being clutched and a knee advancing towards his face.\n'This is gonna hurt...' was his last thought before Lester was thrown out of the arena after being hit.\n*THUD*\nThe third year fell to the ground with a soft thud; knocked out cold.\nThe instructor heaved a sigh in disappointment to see the match concluding so soon before he announced,\n\"Austin wins!\"\nAustin wiped the blood from his lips before asking the instructor, \"Can you feed him a potion before sending him home? He said his mother would be worried.\"\nThe instructor seemed to have remembered something as he said, \"Ah, yes, his mother works in the kitchen. Well, I will ask the healer to feed him one. You can go now, student.\"\nAustin gave him a firm nod before he found his hand being enveloped in a familiar warmth.\n\"Did I worry you?\" Austin asked with a warm smile as he turned towards his beloved.\nWith a soft smile on her face, she said, \"I, indeed, am worried, but the pride I feel right now has completely overshadowed it.\"\nAustin grinned, \"Glad to hear that.\"\n---------**--------\nRudolph was doing something that annoys him to no end.\nResting.\nIt has been like three days already since he was brought here, and thanks to potions and proper care, he has recovered quite well.\nAlthough not completely, his body was functioning well, so he asked if he could 'walk around' a bit. However, the vice-headmaster completely rejected the request, saying that Rudolph would again jump into the arena to train.\nWell, he was not wrong but can there be any better way to recuperate than some light training?\n'It feels so bad to see Rhea coming here every day...' He has told her not to, but the silly girl always comes to meet him after school and before school. Most of the time, if not in the classes, she spends it here in the infirmary.\nAnd that makes him feel guilty, making him feel the need to recover faster, even more.\n\"You have a visitor.\" The nurse informed, making Rudolph think that it was Rhea again...but much to his disappointment, it wasn't her.\n\"Morkel.\" With his voice a little heavy, and a frown knitting his brows, Rudolph called out.\nThe green-haired man pressed his finger against the bridge of his glasses, as he said, \"You seem dissatisfied. Were you expecting Rhea to come?\"\nRudolph heaved a weary sigh, \"Just tell me why you came to meet me. I am not in the mood to argue with you.\"\nMorkel chuckled, \"Look at you, being all wary of me and all friendly with our enemy.\"\nRudolph's frown deepened, \"What nonsense are you spouting now? What enemy?\"\nMorkel, with his brows raised, asked, \"Oh you know him. Your dear childhood friend, who framed Parkinson? Does that ring any bells?\"\nRudolph growled, \"Don't you fucking dare talk nonsense about Austin. We all had the evidence against Parkinson.\"\nMorkel chuckled, \"You will always remain a knucklehead, Rudolph. Well, let me share some insight that might help you realize one or two things about your dear friend~\"\n---------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 63: Chapter 62- Worth\nAustin's heart raced as the battlefield became a blur of movements.\nCLANG! CLINK!\nValerie's spear thrust forward with lightning precision, the air hissing around its tip. Sebastian sidestepped with inhuman speed, his steel baton meeting her weapon in a deafening clash.\n\"Good observation, lady.\" The butler praised.\nValerie spun, her spear sweeping low in a circular motion. Dust exploded as the weapon scraped the ground, aiming for Sebastian's legs, but he leaped back effortlessly his figure blurring.\nWHOOSH.\nA sharp jab from his baton grazed her ribs. Valerie staggered slightly, then planted her spear into the ground for balance.\n\"Fast,\" she admitted, her lips curling into a smirk. \"But speed means nothing if you can't land a clean hit.\"\nSebastian's figure flickered, appearing to her left. \"Care to test that theory?\"\nValerie didn't answer. Instead, she thrust her spear forward in a feint, pulling back instantly and spinning the weapon above her head. A sharp gust of wind followed, forcing Sebastian to retreat for a fraction of a second—just enough time.\nShe lunged, her spear glowing faintly as she aimed for his chest.\nCLANG!\nSebastian blocked, but the force of the strike sent him sliding back, his feet dragging through the dirt.\n\"What strength...\" Sebastian sighed before his figure dissolved in thin air.\nValerie's breathing steadied as she scanned the area, her spear raised and ready.\nA faint sound came from her right. She turned sharply, thrusting her spear, but it struck nothing. Sebastian appeared behind her, his baton swinging down.\nShe spun, blocking just in time, and pushed him with enough force to create a gap for her kick to land on his chest.\n**DHAK**\nSebastian was forced back, as he finally concluded, \"I think this should be it.\"\nValerie paused in her tracks as she asked, \"Are you fine?\"\nSebastian nodded, before he revealed his reason to stop her, \"You have been sparring for the past four hours. First with the young master and now me. You should not push yourself this much, Miss Valerie.\"\n\"Yeah, he is right.\" Pushing himself up, Austin approached his beloved fiancée and said, \"It's not like we are going to a war tomorrow.\"\n\"But we are, in a few days, no?\" Valerie asked, her voice sounding serious this time.\nSebastian exchanged a glance with the Prince before voicing, \"It's not exactly a war, lady. We are going to just gain information about them.\" His words held conviction but left a whole lot of room for questioning.\nAnd those questions were directed at Austin.\n\"Let's talk about it tonight at my office.\"\n--------**-------\n[Combat: 29.5/100]\n{Next reward at 40}\n[Romance: 42/100]\n{Next reward at 60}\n[Durability: 40/100]\n{Next reward at 60}\n[Trickery: 21/100]\n{Next reward at 35}\n[Overall Progression: 31.1/100]\n[Next Reward at 50]\n…\n[Ding!]\n[You have gained a reward upon breaking into the next stage of Durability.]\n[Ding!]\n[You have received a reward for reaching the third stage of Overall Progression.]\nComing out of the steam bath, Austin checked the notification of the system.\nHe has finished the endurance test just now, even though there was a day left.\nIt was a pain initially, but later, once his body got used to it, Austin felt much more immune to extreme heat and cold. And given the relief he felt in the ice bath, he was thinking of making it a part of his daily life.\n\"Show me the rewards.\" Wiping his body, Austin asked.\n[Ding!]\n[Aqua Lungs: Allows the host to breathe underwater for thirty minutes without any trouble.]\n[Note: The duration of the skill cannot be increased.]\n[Limitation: Can be used once in three days.]\nAustin hummed in satisfaction. He would be visiting the city situated by the sea, so surely, this skill could prove to be useful.\nAs he began wearing his clothes, he heard another 'ding'.\n[Prying Eyes: Allows the host to see through any obstacle and spell for thirty seconds.]\n[Limitation: Once in 30 hours]\n[Note: Can be upgraded using system rewards.]\n...\nAustin chuckled; this was one of the most desirable skills back on Earth by many men.\n'This system provides quite good reward eh...but the next threshold becomes quite distant with each accomplishment...' Heaving a sigh, he got up from the bed.\nThere were no classes today, and he planned on visiting Rudolph today and then meeting the Headmaster.\nValerie was taking it easy and resting in her room. She trained more than usual, so Austin told her to rest as much as she could.\nAlthough his mission was important, it doesn't mean he would let Valerie get overworked because of it.\nThere were four days for the tournament to finally begin. If he gets permission from the Headmaster, then he will go to search for the elixir tomorrow and, after giving his trials, leave for Drenovar.\nAnd if the Headmaster denies...well, he has a plan for that as well.\nLeaving his dormitory, Austin was headed towards the infirmary.\nMany students were roaming around in their casual clothes since today was the weekend.\nEntering the main building of the school, he walked through the long corridor. On his left were several storage rooms for medical supplies. And on his right was a beautiful garden where the Protagonist usually spends her time.\nReaching near the end of the corridor Austin turned to his left and entered the infirmary, \"I am here to meet Rudolph.\"\nHe informed the nurse at the reception desk.\nThe nurse looked up from the file she was reading and instantly blushed upon gazing at the handsome Prince.\nHis aquamarine eyes sparkled like gems under the sunlight, perfectly complementing his long, golden hair that fell in soft layers, framing his face and cascading down his back. The neat parting in the middle revealed his sharp features, while the shorter strands at the front added a touch of elegance and charm to his regal appearance.\n\"Y-Yes, please come with me.\" She got up and urged him to follow her.\nWith his hands in his pocket, Austin walked for a short distance before the nurse turned to look at him and gestured, \"He is there.\"\nAustin nodded and before the lady could have said anything further, he walked past her.\n\"Hello, broken mess.\" Austin greeted his friend who was eating muffins or something while sitting on the bed.\nThere were still bandages around his stomach but other than that, he seemed fine.\n\"Damn...what a way to greet your friend who is suffering from boredom.\" Rudolph extended the plate of dessert, but Austin shook his head.\n\"I am good. And what about you? How long will it take?\" The blond one asked as he took the glass of water from a nearby bedside table.\n\"Dunno man, they say they will release me tomorrow, then someone comes to inspect my wounds and say, just one more day.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"Is there any serious problem with your wound? Is it not healing?\"\nRudolph scoffed, \"None can inflict such a wound on me, that I cannot recover from.\"\nAustin rolled his eyes, \"Then why are you still all wrapped up?\"\nThe raven-haired sighed, \"The Dark energy was utilized to injure me, so it is taking a lot longer than usual. And since they know I will be participating in the tournament, they are seeking my full recovery before letting me go.\" Saying so, he inserted a whole donut in his big mouth, at once.\nAustin hummed, as he leaned back in his seat and rested his left leg on the other.\nRudolph set the platter aside, and with his gaze drawn to the ground, he muttered, \"Morkel visited me yesterday.\"\nAustin's brows were raised, \"The third year's Professor? What did he say?\"\nHe was expecting that bespectacled bastard to approach Rudolph so he wasn't that surprised.\nRudolph looked serious, but he didn't hesitate in revealing, \"He was accusing you of framing Parkinson.\"\nWell, he got that right—Austin inwardly muttered.\n\"Hmm? That's...something new.\"\nRudolph heaved a sigh, \"If he had done this before when you were pursuing Rhea, I would have understood since Morkel is the kind of guy who can use such underhanded tactics to remove his competition. However, now that you have finally settled on Valerie...I am completely baffled as to why he is targeting you now.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Well, old rivalry maybe? Forget about him.\"\nRudolph nodded, \"Yeah, let's not talk about him.\" With a grin, Rudolph asked, \"I heard you defeated a Third-year student yesterday. Once I recover, how about sparring a little? Like the old times?\"\nAustin chuckled; it's been a while since they sparred. Rudolph's Shard made him too strong so training with Austin became a waste of time for him\nIn just a short while, thanks to the assistance of the system along with Sebastian and Valerie, Austin has regained his worth in other's eyes.\nHe was no longer the helpless Prince or the heartbroken loser. He now has an ambition in his mind that he would achieve by hook or by crook.\nAnd that is to create a peaceful world where he could happily live with his Val.\n\"Yeah, sure. Let's do that.\"\n--------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 64: Chapter 63- Partner\nAustin expected Morkel to try and convince Rudolph that Austin was the actual culprit behind the incident. However, thanks to Austin's recent deeds and the praises Rudolph heard from Rhea, Rudolph simply swatted those accusation away.\nWell, even if Rudolph suspects something, Austin doesn't think he would take any action. Parkinson was a creep and someone who went ahead of himself while pursuing Rhea.\nThe evidence of being obsessed with her has made Rudolph disgusted with that person; as such, it was highly unlikely he would interfere in this matter any further.\nLeaving the infirmary, he was heading toward the Headmaster's office. The reason for his visit was to request him to let Austin and Valerie give their trials early; on the first day if possible.\n'System, is there any way to divide the parameters into different divisions? Like, can I get specific stats for my strength and speed?'\nIt was becoming a little difficult to track which field he should be focusing on. Like, during the battle against Lester, he was able to track the man, however, his body wasn't able to react.\nAnd in comparison to heat, he can withstand cold temperatures fairly well. So what was his resistance against poison and sound waves? How far can he withhold against curses and mental interference magic?\nThat's why if he gets separate stats-\n[Not yet, host. Once you reach a certain threshold, you may receive a separate status window for every attribute.]\n\"...\" Well, fine. He has to earn every single thing with this one.\n*Knock*\nReaching the headmaster's office, he knocked once and heard, \"Come in.\"\n\"Excuse me for intr-uding…\" the pause came because Austin was dazed to see a face he was too damn familiar with, yet every single time, that face leaves him awestruck.\n\"Val…what are you doing here?\" Inside the office, other than the Headmaster there was Valerie as well.\nThe girl smilingly replied, \"I was notified by someone that the Headmaster wants to meet me. Did I surprise you?\"\n\"Yeah…but in the best way possible.\" That response added faint redness to her fluffy cheeks.\n\"Haah~youth.\" The man behind the desk sighed, making Austin realize that this might not be the best place to flirt. But what can he do? He was actually very surprised to find her here.\n\"I had something to discuss with student Valerie and received your request, so I asked her to come as well.\" Interlacing his fingers on the table, the man added, \"After all, this involves both of you.\"\nAustin frowned slightly, as he said, \"I think, before stating my request, I would like to hear what you have to say.\"\nPhilius nodded, \"If you insist. First, sit down.\"\nAustin pulled a chair for the lady, earning a melodious 'Thank you' in response, before taking the seat beside her.\nPhilius began, \"Do you know the importance of this tournament?\"\nAustin shared a glance with Valerie before asking, \"Are we talking about in relation to the nation, how important is it?\"\nThe Headmaster nodded, ushering Valerie to say, \"The tournament allows the other nation to witness the strength of each kingdom's rising warriors; further helping them to decide which country in the future they want to 'invest' in.\"\nHere, investing means various things, like trade, supplies, and financial support.\nThe older one nodded, \"In short, the students participating in this tournament decide the future of the nation, in a way.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh and remained silent. He still had no idea where he was taking this conversation.\n\"As you two know, Valorian Academy has always remained near the bottom during the tournament. Because of the lack of facilities—don't mind my words, Austin—we cannot provide the training and give experience to the students which could help them grow.\"\nAustin shook his head, implying that he didn't mind.\nThe reason why Valorian Academy fails is because of a lack of facilities, he says. However, in Austin's eyes,\n\"It's the failure of the students, sir.\" He said, not a speck of hesitation in his voice, \"I am sure you know that the nation in the far north, our neighboring country, doesn't provide facilities to their cadets. The students of their central academy train and learn in the wild—they are trained like soldiers and are provided very basic necessities. And if I am not wrong, the Auroracrest Academy has ranked in the top three most of the time, no?\"\nPhilius smiled in defeat, \"Well, we cannot blame the students…it's just the facilities they are provided with since their birth that don't allow them to adapt.\"\nAustin nodded; most of the students who come here are from noble families, so it was understandable why Valorian Academy ranks so low.\nA brief pause befell in the room before the oldest one again began, \"So, as you know, the first round of Elite division requires two students to participate. Each school can send three pairs.\" Turning his gaze towards Valerie, Philius added, \"And I know that you will be among the six.\"\nAustin held his breath…so this was it.\n\"As such, I want to know about your preference first, Student Valerie, since, as you know, in the contest, you need to trust your partner.\"\nAlthough the contest changes, the basics remain the same. In the team-up battle, the two have to always remain in coordination and blindly trust each other.\nValerie didn't hesitate to say, \"I want to participate with Austin, sir.\"\nPhilius heaved a sigh, \"I expected much…\" Looking at the other one, he added, \"But Austin, you do know the perquisite of participating as an Elite, right?\"\n\"I need to be ranked B,\" Austin spoke, with his fists clenched and a serious frown marring his face.\nPhilius nodded, \"Yes—that's what every academy follows, but….for you, I am about to make an exception.\"\nAustin's eyes stretched slightly, and Valerie gasped in disbelief and excitement.\nThe older one added, \"I have seen you train these days…and I know what you recently accomplished, which, as a student, is incredible and praiseworthy. So I know you exceed your past self.\"\n\"That's why, Austin, I am giving you an opportunity; if you can beat the person I selected as Valerie's partner, you can participate as an Elite, regardless of your rank.\"\nAustin took a deep breath. He didn't reveal the fact that he has already leveled up and reached C-rank.\nWhy? Well, unless your Shard doesn't evolve, an awakened remains on the same stage throughout their life. As such, in the Headmaster's eyes, Austin was still a D-rank who defeated a demon…possibly by luck.\n'Well, unless I reach a rank where I don't get forced to serve the military or Council, I shouldn't reveal it.'\n\"Okay headmaster, I am ready to face the challenge.\"\n—-----**------\nAfter leaving the office, Valerie and Austin decided to have tea together.\nWhile holding hands, they walked down the gallery in silence for a few moments, before Valerie asked, \"When are we leaving?\"\nAustin thought for a moment before responding, \"Since we got the assurance that our matches will be held on the first day, we can-\" Austin suddenly took a sharp turn to look behind him.\nValerie frowned, \"Is anyone there?\" Her detection abilities were not as good as her Lord so she failed to notice anything.\nAustin didn't reply to her; rather, he used his 'Prying Eyes' to see through the walls.\n'Heeh~talk about an elite stalker…' Austin saw Morkel standing behind the wall, undoubtedly spying on them.\n\"Well, it was nothing. Anyway, we will leave for the capital just the day after the trials. We can't let your father get the wrong idea about our relationship.\"\nValerie wasn't dumb to not understand that, indeed, there was someone listening to their conversation, so she played along, \"Although I have told him my decision regarding the engagement, it would be better if you meet him in person and assure him.\"\nAustin grinned, \"That…I surely will.\" Although not immediately, Austin was planning to actually visit his in-laws as soon as he could.\nHe has never paid them a visit after the engagement. They have only met through the gathering during his birthday. And that is very inappropriate.\n'The great forest where we can find the elixir is just a single day from the Duchy…'\nThey made their way out of the main building and once Austin made sure that they weren't heard, he whispered to Valerie, \"About the trip and everything related to Drenovar, we will only talk in my office.\"\nValerie lowered her eyes and apologized, \"I am sorry about earlier. I should have been careful.\"\nAustin gave her hand a light squeeze before relating, \"It's okay. Now let's go and enjoy some fresh tea.\"\nMeanwhile, Parkinson frowned upon realizing that they were leaving just after the trials.\n'They surely aren't going to meet Lord Corwon…' Looking at the place from where the duo disappeared, Morkel muttered,\n\"What are you brewing, Austin…*\n—--**----\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed reading the chapter.

      "content": "Chapter 65: Chapter 64- Advice\nIt was frustrating.\n*CLANG*\nThe sword of the girl struck onto the mechanical doll yet it didn't slice it. Two months ago, it used to slice it.\nThat's why it's frustrating.\n\"*Huff* *Huff* \" Stepping back, she held the glowing sword with both of her hands and looked at the training doll, which had received several slashes but not any significant damage that could have killed a living being.\nIt was frustrating.\nShe has already gained her second Evolution, making her an A-rank. And, on top of it, Rhea was the only human being in the whole world who could summon a second Shard as well.\nWhat a lucky girl. But...\n'It's so goddamn frustrating!'\n*CLANG*\nAnother strike, and with all the ferocity she held, it did nothing when her Shard connected with the doll, and vibration from the metal, shook her arms.\nGritting her teeth, she raised her sword and began hitting the target with blunt force.\n*CLANG* *CLANG* *CLANG*\nAfter her defeat—no, after her embarrassing defeat against the third year, she had been like this. That's why, even so late at night the girl was inside the gymnasium.\nIt would have been understandable if she had lost against an impossibly difficult opponent—however, her past self would have been able to defeat the guy she faced today.\n'What is wrong with me?!'\n*CLANG*\nForced back on her feet, she breathed roughly as the doll was finally broken, but not cleaved.\nAnd that was a shame in the name of swordsmanship.\n\"Tired of yourself?\"\nSuddenly, a voice, a familiar one, called out.\nRhea turned her head, and indeed, it was Austin standing there.\nHe seemed sweaty, which meant he was also training in the gym, yet she never noticed.\nRhea heaved a sigh, and responded, \"Kind of.\"\n\"Then why don't you take a break and try to think what is going wrong with you?\"\nRhea shook her head, \"I just need to take it from the top and keep myself focused this time.\" She cannot continue to slack off. The tournament begins in four days, and if she continues like this, she might not be able to participate as an Elite.\n...or maybe couldn't participate at all.\n'No, no, no! That's not acceptable!' Inwardly she shook her head and clenched her fists in determination.\nAnd because of her inner monologue, she never sensed Austin approaching.\n\"Rhea,\"\n\"Ah!\" She was startled as she jumped back.\nAustin continued, \"What do you see when you raise your sword and try to decapitate a training doll?\"\nRhea opened her mouth, but no word came. She...just couldn't voice it out.\nAustin exhaled a sigh, before answering the question he asked, \"You remember the Demon you slaughtered back then, no?\"\nRhea's shoulders lost their strength as her Shard slowly disintegrated. With her eyes unfocused, she nodded.\nShe...just couldn't get over the grief of killing someone who was begging for mercy. She wasn't like that. She always believed in giving others a second chance.\nIn the past, she has only retorted to killing when she caught a beast causing mayhem. That's why, when an inhumane being, for the first time, begged to let them live, Rhea was shaken up to her core.\nAustin called out, \"Rhea, imagine you let that demon live and that being ends up killing several students of the Academy. And not only that, after locating Rudolph he had killed him as well. Now you tell me, who would have been responsible for all those murders? The Demon? Well, it's his nature to kill humans. So? Who would have been responsible?\"\nRhea's eyes were slightly stretched as she stared at Austin in both realization and regret.\n...she completely forgot something basic in this whole chaos.\nThe reason why she lifted her Sword and swore to become a warrior.\nThe reason why she hates the Demons and wants to slaughter each one of them.\nAnd that reason is...she doesn't want to lose someone close to her. Ever again.\nWith a newfound determination ablaze in her eyes, the pink head voiced, \"Thank you, Austin. You helped me a lot.\"\nAustin shrugged, \"Well, I just stated the fact.\"\n-------**-------\nExiting the gymnasium, Austin turned to his left and found his beloved standing there\nHe has already told her that he would talk to Rhea today after training. And as he thought, she couldn't resist coming here.\n\"You never gave me any advice.\" A tinge of complaints could be sensed in her voice.\nAustin smiled fondly at her, \"Well, you are already perfect.\" He was about to hold her hand, but then remembered how sweaty he was, and dropped the plan—\n—only to find Valerie hugging his arm without showing any discomfort at all.\n\"But I am so bad at observation. I even failed to notice the demon back then.\"\nAustin hummed; this, indeed, was a problem.\nThe ranking system of this world was kind of flawed. They rank a person based on the evolution of their shard and the opponent they could defeat within a limited time.\nThey should have assessed everything, including speed, senses, and magic control. But even so, Valerie would have ranked 'S' given she only lacks observation skills. Her magic control and other attributes were top-notch.\nAfter a bit of thinking, Austin asked, \"Is there any specific training you are doing to sharpen your senses?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"The instructors back home never focused on that subject, and the instructors of the academy are mostly focused on battle and weapon control.\"\nAustin hummed; that was true. Seriously, if he had been the Headmaster or someone in the management, he would have made several changes in how the instructors handled the students.\nSo...how can he help his lover in her training?\n'Ah...how can I forget?' With a smile, Austin demanded, 'System, give me a quest to enhance my senses.'\n[Sorry host, but you cannot request Quest for a sub-attribute.]\n[Does the host want to request a Quest for Combat progression?]\n\"...\" This system is useless.\nSometimes.\n-------**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 66: Chapter 65- SS: The first day they met\n\"Valerie, you are a creep. Go away.\" This wasn't the first time she heard that word.\nCreep.\nShe has heard it many times from different people.\nHer father is a Duke, that's why she has to join several gatherings regularly. And according to the lessons she had learned by her tutors, she needs to maintain good relationships with people around her.\nBeing the only daughter of the Duke, she has to maintain a good reputation and create connections with the children of other noble households.\nHowever…she couldn't maintain a facade for long and ends up saying things which others don't like much.\nAnd that's why she always gets left out.\n*Step* *Step*\nWalking alone in the garden she kept her face towards the flowers, and wiped her eyes.\nAlthough she doesn't know anyone here, being called a creep and told to go away hurts her.\n'Am I really bad…will I never make any friends?'\nTrying to change herself she has practiced smiling in front of the mirror for hours. Those fake smiles which her Instructor taught her. However, even after practicing for hours, the girl couldn't muster up a smile when it's needed the most.\n'They even threw away the cookies I baked…' She recently learned to bake cookies and brought them so she could make a good impression.\n…However, forget about looking at it, they threw it on the floor.\nNow carrying the pouch of broken cookies, Valerie was wondering if she should eat it or feed the ducks…when suddenly,\n\"Can I have them? I am kind of craving for some sweets.\"\nValerie turned to her left and found a blond guy standing there with his eyes affixed on her cookies.\nShe lifted the bag, and asked, \"You want them. They are all crumbled tho…\"\nThe boy shrugged, \"Who cares about the shape? It's all the taste.\"\nHe stepped forward and took the bag from her.\nTaking out the cookie crumbs, he ate them and instantly, his eyes widened.\nValerie held her breath, \"Is it bad?\" Although she has tried seven times before she couldn't be sure if it would have been the same the eighth time.\nHowever, against her fears, \"It's incredible. The choco chips and the sweetness is on point. I love them.\" He seemed genuinely delighted.\nThe boy smiled as he said, \"You sure have a pretty smile, lady. Will you tell me your name? By the way, I am…\"\n….\n\"Ah..!\" Valerie suddenly jolted out of her sleep as she felt her arm turning numb.\nShe noticed that her arm was pressed under her weight, that's why it was ice cold now.\n\"Haah…what a lovely dream…\" She smiled in daze as she hugged her special pillow close to her.\nOn the pillow the figure of a certain blond was etched. And not only that her bedsheet, the paintings around the room, and even on her pajamas…there was only Austin and Austin.\nWith a smile full of happiness, she fell back on the bed and enjoyed a few moments of bliss, before finally leaving her bed.\nTaking a shower, that erased her drowsiness, she brushed her teeth. Checking her nails, she took her time braiding her hair.\nAfter that, she took out her clothes and changed into her training attire.\n\"Hmm…\" Her eyes fell on the packet of flour on the kitchen counter. Since she had some time, she decided to bake some cookies.\nShe had already had all the ingredients since she was planning to bake something for her Lord, for some time now.\nShe tied her apron quickly, brushing a strand of hair from her face.\nShe grabbed a large mixing bowl, tossing in butter and sugar, her hands moving fast as she whipped them together with a wooden spoon.\nThe soft sound of butter creaming filled the air. Next came the eggs—she cracked them one-handed, tossing the shells into the sink without breaking stride.\nFlour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt went into another bowl. She didn't bother measuring too precisely; she trusted her instincts. With a quick motion, she combined the dry ingredients with the wet, stirring until the dough came together.\nChunks of chocolate followed, and Valerie grabbed a spoon, dropping rough scoops of dough onto a baking tray.\nThe makeshift baking pot was already pre-heated so she just placed the tray inside and undid her apron.\nLetting it bake inside until she find it appropriate, she finally took it out and let it rest for a few minutes.\nWith a smile, she took a similar bag, in which she used to bring cookies for Austin back then.\n'Does he still remember…' Valerie seldom came to meet him and only gave him cookies like four times, even that, when she was not awakened. After awakening her Shard she rarely met him.\nWith slight hope and extreme nervousness she packed the cookies and walked out of her room.\nHeading toward the training ground, she found her beloved already present there; stretching his arms.\n\"G-Good morning.\" Unusually nervous, she greeted him.\nAustin turned towards her with a smile, \"Morning…hmm?\" His eyes landed on the small packet she held in both of her hands.\n\"This…is for me?\" Austin asked, as he took the cookies from her hand.\nValerie said, \"I thought you may like it…\"\nAustin smiled, as he took out one of the cookies, and said, \"Although you have shaped them quite perfectly,\" He crumbled them in his hand before pouring the crumbs in his mouth, \"I like it more this way.\" While chewing, he told her.\nValerie's eyes slightly widened as she covered her mouth and asked, \"Y-You still remember…\"\nAustin grinned, \"How can I forget that day, when I met you for the first time?\"\nValerie's face was full of smiles. She assumed that since so much time had passed, he might not have remembered it. But…\n'You treasure everything related to me as much as I do…'\n—-----**-------\nA/N:- If you are wondering, then yes, Austin and Luke's soul merged. Austin never died, he just unlocked Luke's memories. Well, I might mention it at some point.",

      "content": "Chapter 67: Chapter 66- The last option?\nIt was another day for Harold in the academy as a professor.\nHe was currently in charge of third-year students, his main subject remains beast anatomy.\nWell, he applied for a physical training educator; however, considering his not-so-friendly fighting style, the board decided that he would be too much for the young children. And in the end, he was told to stick to books.\nHarold used to work as an Executioner, a post given to a hunter whose sole job was to hunt and kill his prey. There are porters, warriors, tanks, supporters, healers, and the least desirable job: executioner.\nHarold has spilled tons of blood from his enemies in the past. He was only told to hunt beasts and demons who loitered around the nation; however, at one point, his craving for blood elevated so much that he ended up intruding into the Cursed Realm.\nA world on the other side of the Riftline.\nHe wanted to kill and kill, as such, rather than searching for one or two prey, he chose to jump into the den of demons.\n...he barely managed to return alive. It was not a place, it was a literal hell.\nDark red skies, suffocating thick and heavy air, and a world devoted to chaos.\nIt was thanks to the Union Council that pulled him away from there or Harold was dead that day.\nThen, the Union Council ordered him to serve the Academy for a few years as a punishment....and once Harold began his journey as a teacher, he stopped seeking the same bloody path he once loved to tread.\n\"Morning, Professor.\" One of the early waking students, the vice-president of the student council, Sheldon Runebound, greeted him.\n\"Good morning, Sheldon. I can see that you are following your routine as always.\" He was one of the very few students in the academy who seemed more mature than his age and had a definite life goal.\nSomeone who thrives to become the best.\n\"Discipline is one of the most basic necessary traits for a student.\" He responded; his face not revealing any emotion.\nHarold nodded, \"Continue then.\"\nSheldon nodded before he resumed his jogging.\nThe vice headmaster had woken up a little earlier than usual, so he was just casually patrolling around the school.\nUnexpectedly, he found a pair of students, so early training as well.\n\"Hmm?\" It was Valerie and Austin; currently engaged in a non-typical routine of training.\nValerie's eyes were covered with a blindfold, while Austin moved around the ground, trying to close in without letting her notice\nSometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.\nHarold frowned; an S-rank is having trouble tracing a being who was purposely radiating his Soul energy(Austin was wielding his Shard)?\n\"Ah, Professor Harold.\" Austin noticed the man standing nearby, so he called out.\nValerie lifted the blindfold before greeting him, \"Good morning, sir.\"\nHarold gave a short nod before asking, \"What you two were doing just now?\" Although he guessed it, he needed confirmation.\nAnd as he expected, \"I was helping Valerie train her senses.\"\nHarold's brows knitted in a tight frown, \"Valerie? Did you not give a rank evaluation test before assuming your rank?\"\nThe violet-haired's expression turned a little solemn, while Austin visibly frowned in displeasure.\nAfter a brief pause, she responded, \"Their testing method is flawed and doesn't evaluate all the attributes of a warrior. I overwhelmed the parameters with my strength and magic control.\"\nHarold received his answer, \"That is correct. I apologize for doubting you.\" Heaving a sigh, he added, \"Don't you have a better way of training? Austin has adopted a good method, but that's not how you train your basics.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"But I thought sensing the source of Soul Energy should be the basic?\"\nHarold shook his head, \"The most basic level of observation requires you to listen to your opponent's movements. Their footsteps, and if that's not it, you need to hear their breathing, their heartbeat.\"\nValerie and Austin were amazed as the latter asked, \"Is that even possible? And in the first place, is it required?\"\nHarold chuckled, a very rare laugh escaping his throat, as he enlightened the duo, \"If you don't know, seventy percent of assassins and mercenaries are non-awakened. Why? Well, because most of the time they are told to hunt those who can sense Soul Energy clearly or have a tool for that. That's why there is a demand for non-awakened hunters in the market.\"\nAustin slowly nodded, acknowledging that what he was saying, made sense.\nHarold folded his arms on his chest before relaying, \"I have a perfect tool to help you, Valerie, in my storage. An artifact I once won in a bet that allows one to sharpen their observation skill.\"\nFor some amusing reasons, more than Valerie, Austin seemed excited as he said, \"Is that so? Can we get that?\"\nHarold smiled fondly, \"Yes, I can lend you that. However, don't let anyone find out that it was me who gave you the artifact.\"\nAustin nodded, \"Thank you, sir.\"\n---------**--------\n[Capital of Eryndor]\n\"The situation is getting severe.\" The Prime Minister voiced as he sat on the round table along with the other ministers.\nThe situation of Drenovar was getting serious; recently five spies were caught snooping around in Eryndor. Although they killed themselves before the authorities could have taken them for interrogation, it was pretty much evident which country would have sent spies to Eryndor so aggressively.\nCedric had a frown on his face as he looked at the map of the Capital; there were four main entrances, and the guards of the front entrance were slaughtered, possibly by the five assassins.\nThis was not an attempt to spy on them since if spying had been the motive, they wouldn't have slaughtered seventeen top-ranking soldiers in the first place.\nIt was an announcement that Drenovar could enter Eryndor anytime and annihilate them on will.\n\"Father, I think we should send forces in retaliation.\" The First Prince of the nation voiced with a serious look on his face.\nThe Captain of the Imperial Legion agreed, \"Indeed, we must portray that we are not weak, Your Majesty. I am in support of what Your Highness just suggested.\"\nCedric heaved a sigh, before telling them, \"Direct retaliation means we have accepted their challenge and are ready for a war.\"\n\"But what's the problem with that? We can't just let them send forces one after another and lose our people's faith.\" When Aiden said that, several heads turned towards each other; muttering and nodding in assent.\nFrom their perspective, it would be disastrous if the civilians lost their faith in the government and decided to migrate.\nHowever, only the Prime Minister and the King know the actual problem here.\nEryndor was not prepared to face Drenovar in battle unless they received support from any of the three major countries.\nTheir army supplies and human resources were limited and comparatively very little.\nAnd under such circumstances, it would be like harming oneself to retain one's pride.\nAiden narrowed his eyes and said, \"If the number of soldiers is a problem, then we can ask non-militant entities to fight for their nation.\"\nThat statement gained many confused looks as the Chief Advisor asked, \"What do you mean, Prince? Are we talking about forced recruitment of the general masses?\" There have been several cases when some nations recruited civilians into the military during a war.\nHowever, Aiden had a different opinion, \"That would be a little too much for them...after all, the general masses are completely unrelated to military works.\"\nTurning his gaze towards the Supreme Authority, the silver-haired added, \"However, it won't be unfair to ask those who are aiming to become warriors in the future. For example, the students of the Academy?\"\n\"...!\" Several eyes widened in realization, and the Prime Minister was stunned at the suggestion too.\nSurely, those who have been admitted to the academy are aiming to become a renowned warrior in the future, however, they still were kids.\nThe Prime Minister—Oakdine Arthur, couldn't help but glance at His Majesty and think, 'What will you do, Your Majesty...' As the Prime Minister, he had the authority to say something here, however, considering how many ministers seemed convinced by Aiden's idea, he left the burden on the King.\nAnd as Arthur wished, \"We cannot push young children to bear the burden of a war. True, they are preparing to become a warrior in the future, but not all of them wish to fight on the frontline.\"\nLooking at Aiden, Cedric clearly stated, \"So no, we are not going to recruit any students for this war.\"\nAiden lowered his head, seemingly accepting whatever his father wished; however, under the table, his nails dug into his flesh as he clenched his fist in agitation.\nFuck!\nCedric intertwined his fingers on the table as he thought,\n'This is concerning...I might have to..ugh...'\n\"Your Majesty?\" The Prime Minister rose from his seat seeing the King clutching his chest\nHowever, Cedric shook his head and said, \"I am fine...\"\n---------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 68: Chapter 67- Sudden quest\nThere are two days left, if taken out today, for the Tournament to officially commence.\nThe gymnasium has been set off-limits by the management since that's the place where all the trials would be taking place.\nFor fair competition and to avoid favoritism, two members of the council committee attend the trials. Their only motive is to ensure fair competition and right judgment.\nThere are a few instances as well, when the Council interfered in the selection procedure by giving the position of participation to someone who might have faced defeat but showed better potential than the winner.\nAlthough the practice was quite criticized, the Union Council has made no move to abolish the method.\nAs such, the participants aiming to become a part of the Tournament not only have to win the matches but also have to show their potential by going all out.\nAfter all, they would rather have a competent loser rather than a complacent winner.\n**CRACK**\nThe face of the wooden doll cracked as Rudolph landed the punch squarely on the tool.\nThose girls who came to watch him, squealed in excitement to see their idol being back in shape.\nSince the training hall was currently being prepared for the trials, the students were allowed to utilize the outdoor grounds to train. Naturally, all the equipment required and requested was delivered to them.\nSweat dripped down his forehead as Rudolph reeled back his punch and allowed the broken pieces to fall to the ground.\nHe wiped the sweat and gave a nod of satisfaction. He wasn't out of shape, at the very least.\n*Slash*\nHearing the slicing of the blade, Rudolph and many others turned towards the warrior with shiny blond hair, currently involved in melee training with the target, hanging by the bracket.\nAustin was utilizing his Shard to aim for the targets and calling it back as fast as it stabbed before throwing it again.\nThe successive recall of one's Shard is quite taxing, and that could be seen from his complexion.\n\"I am impressed, mate.\" Rudolph approached his friend once Austin finally stopped. There was no one looking at him until now, but when the star warrior from the Apex Circle approached him, every eye turned towards Austin.\nThe blond one raised his brows, \"I missed several targets, tho…\"\nRudolph chuckled, \"We both have a bad aim. And I am talking about your growth. Just until a few days ago, you couldn't detach your Shard from you, and now…you see someone at the peak of your rank.\"\nRudolph was about to suggest re-evaluation, when suddenly, Austin said, \"It's thanks to constant training and the recent events I got involved with.\" Austin somehow sensed what he was about to say, which ushered him to change the topic.\nRudolph grinned, \"Then how about sparring against me? We can help each other improve…like the old times.\"\n\"Pfft-what are you spouting, bud. You will break his morale before the event.\" One of the guys, whom Austin remembered to be a third-year student, suddenly interrupted them.\n'The guy on the Disciplinary Committee…Abel.' Austin has begun taking a record of every notable being in the university who may interfere with the plot in one way or another.\nRudolph growled, \"Who are you to intervene between our talk?\"\nThe grey-haired's eyes narrowed. His Soul energy made it difficult to breathe, as he uttered, \"Your senior and someone who is just stating the fact.\"\nThe students began to gather around. They could sense the tension in the air and the probable battle incoming.\nRudolph was not someone who could get intimidated so easily.\nWith his canines peeking, the raven-haired stepped toward the senior. His hands in his pockets, as he leaned forward and said, \"Now I remember your face. Aren't you the same guy whose post was taken away by my classmate, and as a third year you had to work under her?\"\nRudolph suddenly leaned back and with a thoughtful look, he cupped his chin, \"Oh~so you are here to take revenge on Austin. Oh, my poor soul.\"\n\"Pfft-hahahah!\"\n\"Seriously, Abel…have some dignity man…\"\n\"His senior from second year…uh, isn't it…\"\nHearing all the mockery and ridicule, Abel's aura flared as he was about to jump on Rudolph, \"You…!\"\nBut then, a violent surge of energy completely swatted away Abel's aura, even throwing him off his feet.\nEvery eye turned towards the person in awe and amazement, while Austin was the only person who looked at her with fondness.\nValerie stepped forward, her presence domineering. Clad in a black shirt and white skirt, she was extruding a very youthful charm. However, those cold and calculating eyes warned everyone to remain five feet away from the girl.\nLooking down at the fallen officer, she said, \"Senior Abel, since you have forgotten, I must remind you: according to the rules, instigating a fight or provoking someone is a punishable offense unless you have the permission of a duel. And you, clearly, don't have one.\"\nAbel growled, \"Arrived again, to flash your authority!\"\nHe scrambled to his feet, and glared at Austin, \"At least I am better than you…hiding behind a woman.\"\nAustin rolled his eyes. This world was filled with this kind of people who believed in male supremacy.\nAbel didn't stand there for long, before Valerie turned towards Rudolph and warned him too, \"I am aware of your passion for battle, but provoking someone like this is-\"\nRudolph scoffed, \"Look at you, being all wise and disciplined.\" With a grin, he added, \"You accept it or not, but if that snort had insulted Austin again, you might have directly crushed him rather than provoking him like me.\"\nValerie was rendered speechless. He was…probably right.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"You both have a short temper, eh? Learn from me.\"\n\"Yeah, you should, Rudolph. I was kind of nervous seeing you picking on a third year.\" Rhea walked in, as she undid her bun and allowed her short hair to freely fall over her shoulder.\nRudolph was stunned, \"When did you cut your hair?!\"\nHe met her this morning and she still had her silky long hair.\nRhea shrugged, \"It was a distraction and a burden to take care of.\" She narrowed her eyes, with a grin extending her lips, \"Are you going to no longer associate with me, just because I am no longer beautiful?\"\nRudolph, with all sincerity, responded, \"That can never be possible, and you are still beautiful.\"\nRhea was startled to hear such a quick response, as a faint blush appeared on her cheeks.\nMeanwhile, Austin suddenly received an unexpected notification on the system screen,\n[Ding!]\n[Path to becoming stronger!]\n[A sudden quest has appeared!]\n[Would you like to see?]\n[Y/N]\nHe was startled to receive the sudden notification.\nUntil now, unless he demanded a quest, the System never proposed one on its initiative. That's why it was surprising.\n\"Austin?\" Seeing him being dazed, Valerie called out.\nAustin shook his head, \"It's nothing…\" Turning his eyes toward his fiancée, he asked, \"How did the training go?\"\nValerie received the artifact to train her observation skills, and she has been cooped up in her room since morning, training her senses in a compact place as in the beginning.\nValerie smilingly replied, \"I think this will be helpful. I was actually able to pick up on traces of movement and react on time.\" Glancing around and making sure that no one was looking, she whispered, \"...i-if you want…y-you can come to my room and t-train with me…\"\n*Ba* *Dum*\nThat made his heart race. However, he had a feeling that the quest from the system would take some time, so he said,\n\"I will try to sneak in…but don't wait for me and continue your training. We only have two days.\"\nValerie nodded with her fist clenched, \"Yes.\"\n…\nAfter separating from the group, Austin headed back to his room.\nEn route, he asked,\n'Show me what this quest is about.'\n[Ding!]\n[Path to Becoming Stronger Unlocked]\n[A new quest has been generated to assist the Host in developing skills and enhancing stats.]\nQuest Objective: The Host will be transported to a fully simulated environment where specific tasks must be completed to earn points.\nReward System: Points earned during the quest can be allocated to upgrade individual stats, excluding Overall Progression.\nBonus Rewards: Exceptional performance may grant additional rewards, including rare items or unique abilities.\nTime Distortion: The simulated dimension operates outside the Host's reality. No time will elapse in the real world, regardless of the duration spent within the quest.\n[Prepare yourself, Host. Your path to strength awaits.]\nAustin read the description twice. This was unexpected.\nIf he accepts the quest, which he most likely will, he can gain strength and experience before the tournament.\nThinking for a bit, he asked, 'Can I die there?'\n[Yes, host.

      "content": "Chapter 69: Chapter 68- Grinding(1)\nAustin was kind of nervous. However, this was necessary. His current growth rate was not enough. He would be getting involved with the nation which was on the verge of a war with Eryndor.\nA single mistake means Austin would be trapped there with Valerie and Sebastian. And he cannot depend on those two to protect him. Not then, not now.\nHe hasn't taken offense to what the Demon or Abel said about him depending on Valerie. He could never be ashamed of that. However, he still hasn't forgotten that incident when Valerie was facing that Monkey, and more than defeating the creature, she was focused on keeping him safe.\nHe wants to walk beside her...wants to be her strength, not weakness.\nThat's why this was necessary.\n[System Notification]\n[Dungeon Name: Moonlit Mirage]\n[Level: C-]\n[Time Limit: 6 hours]\n[Reward: ???]\n[Important Notes:]\n[1. Attribute Point Scaling:]\n[Durability: +1 requires 20 dungeon points.]\n[Combat: +1 requires 40 dungeon points.]\n[Other attributes follow similar scaling.]\n[2. Magical Item Enhancement:]\n[Dungeon points can be used to upgrade magical items obtained as system rewards.]\n[3. Shop Unlock:]\n[Cost: 500 dungeon points to activate the 'Shop' feature.]\n[4. Retreat Requirement:]\n[Minimum Points Required: 10 dungeon points.]\n[Tip: Perform efficiently to maximize point acquisition and unlock system benefits.]\nAustin read the notifications carefully, before he asked, \"Unless I don't score ten, I can't come back?\"\n[Indeed, host. You at least need ten points for the retreat option to appear.]\nAustin took a deep breath; he couldn't tell what was waiting for him; as such, gaining ten points can become concerning.\n'Well, it's C-...surely, I can handle that much.'\nAfter thinking for a bit, Austin asked, 'Can I take equipment to the dungeon?'\n[No, host. Only the rewards you gained from the system, can be used there.]\n\"...not even my Shard?\" Austin was shocked and now anxious. However,\n[Your Shard is a part of your Soul, so naturally, it's impossible to restrict it.]\nAustin heaved a sigh of relief.\nOpening his drawer, he took out a single photo resting there.\nValerie's smiling face was drawn on the small parchment.\n\"Wish me luck.\" Putting the picture back, he stated, \"I am ready.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Best of luck, host!]\nAustin's vision was surrounded by blinding light, as he closed his eyes and waited to feel the changes.\nHis body did move, but his feet remained rooted. He felt like crossing through a long distance in seconds. However, he hadn't made any move at all.\n*Rustle*\nAustin felt his face being touched by the serene wind.\nHe slowly opened his eyes and found himself in unfamiliar surroundings.\nAustin blinked, his breath catching as he took in the sight before him.\nThe shrine was ancient, yet eerily pristine, as if untouched by time. The curved roof of the main building gleamed faintly under the pale moonlight, its edges adorned with intricate carvings of twisting dragons and coiling smoke.\nLanterns hung from wooden beams, their soft glow casting long, flickering shadows across the ground.\nBut what froze Austin in place were the figures standing in silent rows.\nHundreds of beings stood shrouded in black cloaks, their hoods pulled low to hide their faces. Not a single one moved, yet their presence was suffocating. Each figure held a curved blade in one hand, the edge glinting menacingly under the moonlight.\nThey faced the shrine, unmoving, like statues waiting for a command.\nAustin could see grey numbers over their heads, indicating: 1\n'So they are worth 1 point, eh?' Austin needed to defeat at least ten of them to get back. However, his focus was currently on how much he could defeat in one go.\nThere was a red line, before which he stood. Austin instinctively knew that if he crossed the line, those beings would attack him.\nAustin rolled his sleeve and summoned his dagger in his left hand.\n\"Let's go!\" In an instant, he jumped forward, and the other side moved as well.\nThree beings marched forward, wielding their weapon and faintly releasing their aura.\nHowever, surprisingly, Austin was the first to reach them, as he ducked under the first one's attack and simultaneously plunged his dagger into the ninja's throat.\n*SHWAAA*\nThe dungeon resident disintegrated at the attack before Austin jumped back—before the other two could have attacked him.\nAustin's lips curled into a faint smirk. \"This might be easier than I thought.\"\nThe remaining two ninjas lunged, their curved blades slicing through the air. Austin sidestepped, the sharp wind of their missed strikes brushing his face. He spun low, his dagger flashing as it carved into the leg of one enemy.\nCRACKLE!\nThe figure crumbled into ash, disintegration just like the first.\nThe last ninja spun around, blade raised for a downward strike. Austin leaped back, avoiding the deadly arc, then surged forward, slamming his dagger into its chest before it could recover.\nSHWAAA!\nAnother one is gone.\n\"Three down. Seven to go.\" Austin's eyes darted to the approaching figures—this time, five were coming at once.\nThey moved faster, more coordinated, blades whistling as they cut through the space between them. Austin ducked under one strike, kicked off the ground, and twisted mid-air to avoid another.\nCLANG!\nHis dagger clashed against an enemy's blade, sparks flying. He slid to the side, slashing his weapon across the ninja's neck.\nThe figure dissolved, but the next ninja was already on him.\nAustin barely raised his dagger in time to block the strike, but because of his lack of footing, the force of the blow sent him stumbling back. His footing faltered, and another enemy took advantage, its blade slashing across his arm.\n'I can't reach it...!' Austin augmented his Shard, making it longer, and barely parrying the attack.\n*CLANG*\nA sudden burst of speed erupted as he used the elongated Shard to slash his enemies one after another.\nJust as the last one dropped to the ground, the hair on the back of his neck stood erect, as Austin ducked just in time to dodge the incoming shuriken.\n*KIRRRK*\nThe sharp blade dug into the tree at the height where his head should have been.\nAustin's eyes widened as he realized that with each wave, the ninjas were getting more dangerous.\nAustin's heart pounded as his eyes darted around, trying to locate the source of the shuriken. The faint rustling of leaves above him was his only warning.\nSWISH!\nA flurry of shuriken rained down. Austin leaped back, narrowly avoiding most of them, but one grazed his thigh, drawing a thin line of blood.\n\"Tch!\" He hissed, the pain sharp but manageable.\nThree ninjas emerged from the shadows, moving in sync. Their steps were eerily silent, and their blades gleamed under the moonlight.\nThey rushed him.\nAustin lunged forward to meet the first, his elongated Shard arcing in a swift, powerful slash. The blade found its mark, cleaving through the ninja's chest and disintegrating it in a burst of ash.\nBut the second and third were already on him.\nAustin parried one blade, then twisted to block the other. Sparks flew as his Shard clashed against their weapons. He spun, aiming to strike one of them, but the ninja ducked and retaliated with a quick jab.\nSLASH!\nThe blade nicked Austin's side, ripping through his shirt and leaving a shallow wound.\n\"Dammit!\" Austin gritted his teeth, jumping back to create distance, but the third ninja closed the gap instantly.\nThe enemy's blade came down in a deadly arc, and Austin barely managed to sidestep it. His Shard lashed out, slicing the ninja's leg, but not before another shuriken zipped through the air.\nTHUNK!\nIt grazed his shoulder, tearing through flesh. Blood trickled down his arm, and the pain made his grip falter for a split second.\nAustin glared at the one throwing Shuriken before he muttered,\n\"You wanna play with throwables, eh?'\nThe Ninja didn't have time to dodge as a heavy boomerang was thrown in its direction, completely destroying its head and ceasing its existence.\n*SHLINK*\nAustin didn't lose focus from the battle, just because he manipulated Wisp. He easily dodged the incoming blade, ducking under it and grabbing the ninja by its throat.\n*CRACK*\nA sickening sound resonated before Austin killed the last of the wave with his bare hand.\n[Ding!]\n[Upon reaching the first threshold, the host gains permission to return to the real world any time he wishes.]\n[Return?]\n[Y/N]\nBlood was trickling down from several corners, and there were more than two hundred ninjas still waiting for their turn.\nAnd...Austin had a feeling that there was a presence, far greater than these small fries, waiting for him inside the shrine. Like a Boss.\nUnder such a situation, the best thing would have been to return and first patch himself up and make a strategy for how to defeat them efficiently.\nHowever,\n\"Who cares~\" Austin grinned, as he recalled Wisp and his Shard in each hand.\nHe was so going to enjoy this battle.\n----------**----------\nA/N:- Well, he also wants to level up. I hope the combat scene wasn't boring, I tried making it fast-paced, and since I am still in learning phase, don't be too harsh in the comments ⊙⁠﹏⁠⊙.",

      "content": "Chapter 70: Chapter 69- Grinding(2)\n\"Haah...haah...\" Austin was...tired.\nSweat and blood poured from different sides of his body. He has been fighting for the past hour and has dispatched more than a hundred ninjas.\nHe received over a hundred points. However, the problem was that with each wave, the points were getting lesser.\nLike now, each ninja gets him only 0.4 points, which means he needs five of them to gain two points.\nHe still had five hours before the System would forcibly throw him out; however, as of now, he couldn't think straight to fight anymore.\nHis hands were trembling, and his vision was hazy.\nIf not for the temporary resting point he purchased for five points, he might have returned by now.\n\"System...show me my stats ...\"\nHe could feel he had become sharper and stronger by now, however, how much, he had no idea.\n[Combat: 32.5/100]\n{Next reward at 40}\n[Romance: 42/100]\n{Next reward at 60}\n[Durability: 44/100]\n{Next reward at 60}\n[Trickery: 21/100]\n{Next reward at 35}\n[Overall Progression: 31.1/100]\n[Next Reward at 50]\n...\nHis combat and durability have gone up in just an hour...crazy.\nAlthough training with Valerie and Sebastian was beneficial, their fondness towards him restricts them from actually going a little harsh on him. So this experience, where his opponents were coming at him with the intention to kill him was quite good for a change.\nBut the question arises whether he should proceed or retreat?\n'Can I really defeat that guy?' After defeating one hundred and fifty dungeon dwellers, a mid-boss appeared before Austin.\nThis one was quite intimidating, wearing a red shroud over its face and carrying a long sword.\nAustin could tell that the being was quite dangerous....but the points highlighting over its head... were quite tempering.\n[Vice Commander Mentis.]\n[100 Points.]\nThat was like defeating two fifty ninjas at once...and that was quite tempting.\n'Should I retreat and come back with more preparation?' The thought passed through his mind when suddenly,\n[Note: If you leave now and enter the dungeon later, you would need to face one hundred and fifty soldiers first before reaching the Vice-commander.]\n\"...\" So this system doesn't want him to leave, eh?\nAustin heaved a sigh. He still had two minutes left before this resting zone would fade away, and he would get attacked by the mid-boss.\n\"Going back and returning...would result in something similar to how I am feeling right now.\"\nAustin wiped the sweat and blood from his face using the corner of his sleeve. His school uniform was quite dirty by now, but he had more than a dozen hanging in the wardrobe, so no worries there.\nSummoning his Shard in his left hand, he squatted on the ground and faintly whispered, 'I know I don't have much Soul Energy left, but until the last breath, stay by my side...' He might have lost a few screws to talk to his Shard, but he felt the real necessity of his Shard's support right now.\nLooking at the clock, Austin saw only thirty seconds left.\nHe clenched his fists and shut his eyes, forcing his racing heart to slow.\nTick. Tick. Tick.\nHis breathing steadied, his thoughts sharpened, and his senses expanded.\nTick. Tick.\n'This is it...'\n**BUZZZZ**\nAustin shot forward like a bullet, his Shard gleaming as he charged at the towering knight. Every muscle screamed with effort as he raised the blade high, aiming straight for its head.\n**WHOOSH**\nThe knight vanished.\nAustin's Shard sliced through nothing but air.\n**WHAM**\n\"Gah!\" The blow came from his blind spot, slamming into his ribs like a sledgehammer. His body spun midair before being sent hurtling away.\n**SCREECH**\nDigging his Shard into the earth, he skidded to a halt, coughing as pain exploded in his side. His gaze snapped up—but the knight was gone again.\n*WHOOSH*\n\"Damn it!\" Austin ducked just as a massive sword carved through the space where his neck had been. The air howled with the force of the swing.\nHe spun while being squatted, and tried to grab the sword by its handle, desperate to gain control.\n*CLANG*\nToo late. The knight jerked the weapon away, its glowing eyes locking onto Austin as its massive fist rocketed toward him.\n**CRACK**\n\"KHAAK!\" The punch hit Austin square in the chest, sending him flying like a ragdoll. Blood burst from his mouth as his back slammed into a jagged rock, the impact knocking the air out of him.\nHe collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath. His body ached, every muscle screaming in pain. His vision blurred, and the knight's heavy footsteps echoed in his ears.\nAustin struggled to stand, his knees shaking. Pain burned everywhere, and for the first time, he felt completely overwhelmed.\n'It hurts... it hurts so much... I can't take this...'\nThe knight drew closer, raising its massive sword. The cold steel gleamed, ready to finish him off.\nAustin could retreat. One word and this would all be over.\nBut then Valerie's face filled his mind—her determined smile, her strength...it was like she was whispering, 'I know you can do it.'\nAgainst his thoughts, the knight reached Austin and delivered the final blow.\n*CLANG*\nThe sword came down, but it didn't hit him. A cyan barrier appeared above him, stopping the blade in its tracks.\n[Ding!]\n[Absolute Barrier is in use!]\nAustin's eyes snapped open. His hand shot up and grabbed the blade. His fingers tightened, blood dripping down the edges, but he didn't let go.\n\"This sword…\" Austin growled, his voice low and full of anger. \"It's annoying.\"\nHis grip tightened, and cracks spread across the blade. The knight jerked back, startled, but Austin didn't give it a chance.\nWith a roar, Austin charged forward, his fist glowing with raw energy.\n**BOOM**\nHis punch connected with the knight's chest. The force was terrifying. The knight's armor caved in with a deafening crunch, and its body shot backward like a missile, slamming into the ground with an earth-shaking crash.\nThe ground trembled. Dust filled the air. Austin stood there, his bloodied hand trembling, his eyes burning with fury.\nAustin clenched his fist and was about to lunge forward to end this battle when suddenly,\n[Congratulations, host, for defeating the Vice-Commander!]\n[You have gained: 100 points.]\n[Total points: 205]\n\"...\" That knight was ...more feeble than Austin thought....\n---------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 71: Chapter 70- Hard choice\nAustin returned to his room—all healed and returned to his previous state before he entered the dungeon.\nHe was quite troubled previously, wondering how he could hide the injuries so that Valerie and Sebastian wouldn't notice. However, he doesn't need to anymore.\n'System?'\n[As mentioned host, it was just a simulation. Unless you die there and lose your connection with the real world, every wound will be healed once you get back.]\nAustin smiled, 'Nice.'\nThen he can go all out next time. Well, he wasn't holding back his punches, but surely, his over-caution during the battle has resulted in restricted movements.\n'So system, I can use the points anytime I want, right?'\n[Yes, host. However, you must use them before entering the dungeon once again, or they will be refreshed.]\n\"...why are you playing games with me?\" Austin was frustrated. He wanted to accumulate the points to unlock the shop feature and here ...\n[A light joke to lift your mood :)]\n[You can use your points anytime you want.]\n\"....\" A broken system he got. Is there any way to exchange?\nHeaving a sigh, Austin went to the bathroom and took a thorough bath. There was no blood but his body was stiff and sore. Although his wounds were healed, his mind was still filled with the thoughts of the battle.\nIt was the first time he went through such intense trials, so naturally, he would be a little overwhelmed.\nAfter the bath, he walked out of the room and tried to find something to eat. However, there was nothing so he dropped the plan and walked back to the bed.\n'I should go and eat something at the common hall...' He thought as he rested his back against the headboard.\nHe had to meet Valerie and have dinner with her...however, he was too tired to move around so before he knew, Austin fell asleep.\n---------**--------\n*Shlik*\nValerie moved just as she heard the sound of movement from her left flank, the wooden sword held tight in her hand, as she launched toward the target\nSlicing the blue flames with the sword, she gracefully landed on the ground without making a single noise.\n*Shlik*\nFollowed instantly by that movement, another sound erupted, this time too close to her, so she didn't bother turning and stabbed the blade behind her with enough force to stab a person.\nShe heard the light dying down, and the session coming to an end.\n\"Haah...\" Exhaling a long sigh, she wiped her sweat and went to pick up the golden orb that was helping her train.\nThis was the artifact she received from the Vice-headmaster that sent several light orbs at random spots within a closed space and made very minimal sound, which one needed to perceive and attack before the orb could hit them.\nHowever, for Valerie, rather than the physical pain of being hit by the orb, she took damage to her pride when she failed to notice those orbs.\nAlthough she wasn't able to dodge and counter every orb, she was slowly getting there.\n\"It's quite late....he didn't come...\" Valerie previously invited Austin to her room—which was quite embarrassing and the girl needs to work on her random impulses—however, he didn't come.\nShe went to the common hall a few minutes ago, and he wasn't there to have dinner as well. Even Sebastian was nowhere to be seen, so she had no idea what he was doing.\n\"...did something happen?\" A frown contoured her moon-like face as she peeked out of the window.\nAbel lives in the same building as Austin, so it wouldn't be too surprising for that annoying incompetent creature to go and trouble her beloved.\n'If only I had a license to kill...'\nShe went into the bathroom and took a quick shower before changing her clothes and wearing a black skirt and pink top.\nSliding her feet into her sandals, she walked down the stairs and was met by a familiar face, \"Oh, hey.\"\nIt was the student council president, Rothaux Annabelle, who greeted her.\nValerie returned the greetings, \"Good evening, President.\"\nAnna looked at Valerie once again before complimenting, \"You look great today. Going on a date with Austin?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"Just going to check on him.\"\nAnna grinned, \"Infiltrating the dorms?\"\nValerie narrowed her eyes, \"I wouldn't go that far...just going to check if he is in the common hall.\" Yeah, she lied. She was definitely going to his room.\nAnna chuckled, seeing her junior trying so hard to suppress her emotions.\nHowever, soon her laughter died down, and the redhead added, \"By the way, you don't need to worry about Abel. I have given him the final warning today that another complaint and his position as a Disciplinary officer would be taken away. Worse, I might make an official request to suspend him.\"\nValerie was taken aback, \"Just because of what happened today?\" She couldn't be any more thankful for the President to take such harsh steps, since insulting her Lord means severe punishment. Death, if possible. However, considering how patient and forgiving the President is, it was quite surprising.\nAnna shook her head and with a smile extending her lips, she added, \"No....he has been breaking quite many rules for the past six months...ever since...\" She paused, not wanting to add the part.\nHowever, Valerie understood what she meant to say. Abel has been rebellious ever since Valerie was given the post of Disciplinary Chief, even though that post should be Abel's. However, it was a known fact that Valerie was one of the most disciplined and upright people; with her strength, Annabelle was forced to make the hard choice.\nThe redhead rested her hand on Valerie's shoulder before assuring her, \"Don't worry about him and focus on the upcoming tournament.\"\nValerie nodded before the older one walked away.\nOnce alone, she began walking...however, her feet weren't leading her to the common hall.\n'Did you forget our promise?' She wants to complain.\n----------**--------\nA/N:- Istg, if I had a girlfriend like Val, I wouldn't have minded listening to her complaint every day. Thanks for reading.",

I never told you to not hang out with your friends, but-\"\n\"Hang out? Really, Nia? You were sleeping over at your friend's place who is a guy and had confessed to you in the past. Don't you find anything….not a single thing weird here?\"\nThe other responded aggressively, \"There were other people as well! And not just because we slept under the same roof, we had sex!\"\n\"...\" Luke lost it. He couldn't understand what was the problem. He has already faced seven breakups by now, and all seven times, he got dumped because of absurd reasons.\nEither the girl said 'You deserved better' or 'You expect too much'. He never expected anything from anyone.\nHe just desired a normal relationship where his partner remained loyal to him…and on whom Luke could actually rely at times. Naturally, he never cheated on any of his girlfriends, since he never was a hypocrite.\nFor the first time, he believed that his partner might be at fault. And that belief continued until a couple of more times since his friends also said that he didn't do anything bad.\nBut ..with time and with each breakup, he started to feel.\n'Is it that….that actually there is something wrong with me?'\n….\n\"Ah…\" Austin woke up from his slumber, his head feeling a little heavy.\nHe didn't know why but he was having a dream of his ex-girlfriend.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nAustin was startled to hear that voice, as he hurriedly turned to his left and found a familiar pair of eyes looking back at him with concern filled in them.\n\"Val…\" He didn't know why, but seeing her right now so unexpectedly filled his heart with inexplicable warmth.\n\"Sorry, I came here without telling you and even stayed…but you looked quite anxious in your sleep…\" She apologized with guilt and nervousness evident on her face.\nAustin wanted to laugh. His source of happiness and peace was being apologetic for approaching him.\nHe tested his back against the headboard, and responded in a soft voice, \"I don't mind…rather, I am happy to see you here. As you said, I was feeling a bit restless.\"\nValerie's thin brows elevated, \"What happened?\" She was like an innocent child worried for her sick parent and being very cautious even while speaking.\nAustin heaved a sigh and held her hand, \"Can I ask you something?\"\nValerie nodded and straightened her back.\n\"Can you do me a favor and tell me if I become annoying at some point? Like I can be unbearable sometimes…make you feel that I am bothersome. So when you feel like it, don't think twice before telling me what I am doing wrong, okay?\"\nValerie was stunned. She couldn't fathom why he thought of something like that all of a sudden. Why would she ever be annoyed with him? Rather, it was she who felt that her actions might become bothersome to him sometimes.\nIn the past, he used to say that she was unbearable; however, recently, after that incident, he always welcomed her presence.\nCall it being paranoid, but she still sometimes feels scared that everything might turn out to be a dream and this dream-like reality might crumble one day.\nThat's why, \"I will…but in return, you have to promise me something as well.\" Holding his hand between hers, she said, \"Whatever happens in the future…if your feelings change for me because of any reason, let me know about it. I will do something to make you not dislike me.\"\nAustin shook his head, \"I love you, Valerie…and that is a fact no one can change.\"\n\"...!\" Valerie paused. A tremor ran down her spine, and her eyes stretched wide.\nAustin was baffled as he asked, \"What happened?\"\nValerie lowered her eyes, her cheeks adopting the shade of the setting sun, as she slowly muttered, \"...y-you confessed…\"\nRealization hit him hard as Austin covered his face in both frustration and slight embarrassment.\nAlthough engaged for almost two years now, he hasn't proposed to her. Like goddamn!\n\"Wait a minute ..\" Valerie was startled when suddenly Austin jumped from the bed and after opening the window, he jumped out.\n\"Huh?\" Shocked, she got up and advanced towards the window, only to find Austin leaping back up, \"Ehhh? How are you so fast? And why did you suddenly jump out?\"\nAustin smiled at the girl before stepping inside.\nStanding face to face with the love of his life, he first knelt on the ground, his left knee firmly pressed on the ground.\n\"Curse me or slap me, I will accept it all, for the crime I have committed.\" Lifting the flower he brought from the garden, he continued,\n\"Although I am late, I want to tell you my feelings, Valerie.\" He was…strangely feeling quite nervous, but not even God could stop him from continuing at the moment,\n\"I have gone through several life experiences and met several people. However, only a single person gave me the feeling that without her …I wouldn't be able to live. That person who has been with me during my hard times and helped me become a man who I am right now. My happiness, and the reason why I have started to love each day of my life.\"\nValerie's eyes turned moist as she remained rooted at her spot, etching each of his words in the deepest spot of her mind so she couldn't forget about them until her last breath.\nAustin locked his eyes with hers before adding, \"I, Austin Eryndor, is head over heels for you, Valerie. And I promise to keep you happy for the rest of your life.\"\nValerie covered her mouth, barely holding a sob. She so wanted to hear those words from him… Finally, today, the man to whom she has devoted her life was confessing his feelings as well.\nRather than answering him, she knelt before her Lord, and to his utmost surprise, Valerie kissed him.\n\"....!!\" Austin's eyes widened as he felt her warm and fluffy lips pressing against his.\nIt was nothing passionate, just a light peck, but that light connection was enough to blow all his senses.\nValerie broke the kiss soon after, before she looked at him with a broad smile, and said,\n\"Please take care of me.\"\n—------**-------\nA/N:- And cut! That's the perfect ending! I'm kidding; this is just the beginning.\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Chapter 72- I need some help....\nThe next morning, Valerie woke up in a daze.\nLast night…something incredible happened.\n\"Gahhhhhh!\" Pressing her face against the pillow, she kicked her legs and punched the bed in embarrassment with evident excitement.\nThis was a very sweet feeling. The one she adores, reciprocated her feelings. He said he loves her…Austin loves Valerie.\n\"Kyaah! I can't!\" Hiding her face she flipped on the bed.\nShe could remember every single detail of last night. Despite the absurdity of the matter, it was an undeniable fact that Valerie got proposed to by the man of her dreams.\n\"Oh my god…my heart is racing…I won't die, right? But I want to spend my life with my Lord. No, no, no dying. He said he wants to spend his life with me; does that mean he wants to marry me? He wants to marry me right?\"\nA happy smile bloomed on her face as she covered her cheeks and fidgeted on the bed.\nIf anyone except for Austin had seen her in her current state, they might have fainted. Austin would have only grinned and patted the soft adorable girl.\nValerie was over cloud nine and couldn't think how she should react. She wanted to dance around and proudly announce that she received a confession.\n\"Would it be too much if I suddenly become a little clingy? I mean, I am now his girlfriend-ah! I am already engaged to him, so it's okay right?\"\nShe was happy.\nHowever, regardless of her happiness, she couldn't neglect her Lord's training.\nShe was happy and excited, but that could wait.\nTaking a shower and following her usual routine, she changed her clothes and wore her training attire.\nJust for a change, she braided her hair and clipped it with a lavender-petalled hair clip.\n\"Is it too much?\" As a warrior, she shouldn't be too focused on her hair…but just for today, \"I want to look a little different.\"\nWith those thoughts, she left the dormitory.\n…\nWhen she reached their usual spot where they train, Valerie found her Lord already stretching his limbs and preparing for the training.\n'Not good…for two days now, I arrived here after him…' In the past, she used to reach here an hour ago, so he didn't need to wait. But these days, she has been irresponsible.\nNot good. Need to change.\n\"Oh, you are here.\" Austin turned towards his beloved and was stunned to find her looking too beautiful for sore eyes.\nIf he could, he would have taken hundreds of pictures of hers right now and saved one of the best of them as his phone wallpaper.\nToo darn beautiful.\n\"I am sorry for arriving late.\" She spoke as she rested the bag on the resting bench, and asked, \"Good morning, Austin.\"\nA smiling Valerie early in the morning…yes, that's the perfect way to start a day.\n\"You braid your hair? It looks beautiful.\"\nValerie shyly smiled, \"T-Thank you…\" A slight red hue appeared on her face as she crossed her hands behind her back.\nThere were not any words spoken between them, yet they talked. The atmosphere around them was quite pleasant and could heal one's heart.\nBut then suddenly,\n\"Morning.\"\nIt was Rhea.\nThe pink head looked genuinely apologetic as soon as she realized that they weren't training but flirting.\nHowever, it was too late; she already called out to him.\n\"Yes, Rhea?\" Heaving a sigh, he asked her.\nRhea was wearing her training outfit as she asked, \"I wanted to take some advice from Valerie…if that's okay.\"\n\"No, it's not.\" Valerie's instant refusal left Rhea sobbing,\n\"O-kay…I will go…\"\nAustin chuckled seeing that action and reaction, before he asked, \"Advice on what?\"\nRhea beamed, finally gaining some hope as she asked, \"About magic control over my Shard.\"\nTurning towards Austin, she summoned her Shard, which had definite features.\nIts surface glows with faint silver runes, shifting subtly as if alive, etched during its second evolution. The hilt is simple but firm, wrapped in a material resembling blackened steel, with a faint aura pulsing from the shard's core.\nRhea was an A-rank because of her Shard's evolution.\nAfter the first evolution, an awakened can augment their Shard and move them away freely from their body. That's why archers who haven't gone through first evolution are basically non-awakened.\nAfter the second evolution, an awakened gains the ability to use the magical attribute of their shard. As for Valerie, it's Ice. And for Rudolph, it's earth magic. Manipulating the element to a basic level is what one gains.\nAlthough it doesn't sound much, the difference between the awakened of the first stage and the second one is quite huge.\nAnd then comes the third stage—a point where the awakened step beyond mortal limits and seize the power to manipulate reality itself. At this stage, they don't just wield magic; they bend the very laws of existence, rewriting nature's rules to obey their will.\nLike Valerie, who trapped the Illusion Monkey within a frozen time chamber, twisting time into her servant and shattering the natural order with a mere thought.\nThis power is why those who reach the third stage are feared as walking calamities—beings who can tear the world apart at their whim. They are called S-rank Awakened, and their very presence heralds destruction.\nValerie didn't want to look bad and rude in her Lord's eyes, that's why she said, \"Tell me what is your problem?\" Quite literally.\nRhea, who didn't notice the displeasure in Valerie's voice, innocently stated, \"When I try launching a simple spell like Ariel Slash, I release too much Soul energy. That's why I can only depend on my magic once or twice during a battle.\"\nValerie was known for her exceptional magic control. Her efficiency while using spells was truly admirable. As such, Rhea thought why not ask the best?\nValerie crossed her arms, and told her, \"Attack me.\"\nRhea was startled, \"W-What?\"\nAustin slowly stepped back as he heard Valerie taunting, \"What happened? Can't you?\"\n\"But it would be too much…you are too close to dodge,\" Rhea argued, finding it absurd how Valerie could ask her to launch an attack from this close.\nSuddenly, Valerie summoned her Shard; the menacing presence of the Spear twisted the air and released crackles from the divine armament.\nWith her eyes cold as steel, Valerie added, \"If you don't, then I will.\" Her words died by the violent noise of her Shard as she swung toward Rhea, and in a panic, Rhea launched a Wind Blade.\n*CLANG*\nValerie easily swatted the advancing blade and allowed Rhea to calm down first.\nThe pink head opened her eyes and asked in disbelief, \"Why did you do that?!\"\nIgnoring her complaint, she explained, \"See that? Just because you were in a panic, you released a huge amount of Soul Energy in that single attack.\" Allowing her Spear to disintegrate, she added, \"Your emotions heavily control the magic control. First, go and calm your mind before trying to use spells.\"\nRhea clutched the handle of the blade tightly as with a resolute expression, she responded,\n\"Understood!\"\n—------**-------\nA/N:- Heroine learning from the Villainess.

      "content": "Chapter 74: Chapter 73- Sick father\n\"So students, we are concluding the classes a little early today so you all can take it easy a little and take your time to prepare for tomorrow.\" It was the period just before recess when the teacher announced.\n\"Every student gets only one chance to prove their worth and make a name for themselves. Some will succeed, others might fail—but never forget what was already decided the moment you stepped into this prestigious school. You are the chosen ones, destined to walk a harsh path, one that leads to glory.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh and stopped listening. It wasn't like he didn't respect the teachers, but because of their restrictions and fear of the student's background, they had to be very careful even while speaking.\nAlthough the Headmaster has abolished exploiting one's status to intimidate others, especially teachers, in the past, there have been several incidents where the Professors had to pay the price for their actions against certain students.\n'The fake liberty of speech is almost laughable...'\nGlancing at Valerie he found the girl intently listening to the teacher. She is the top student and the chief of the disciplinary committee, so it was natural for her to be so attentive in class.\n'Don't look at the teacher so carefully...I might get jealous...' With a smile, he stared at her back for another moment, before calling out,\n'System, tell me something. How many dungeons are there in total?'\n[There are a total of ten dungeons that the Host needs to cross before the Host would reach the epitome of humanity.]\nAustin raised his brows, 'Epitome?'\n[Indeed, host. There are two stages of the system; the first one is called (Warrior Struggle) and the second stage is (Path to Glory).]\nAustin raised his brows, 'When will I enter the second stage and what is different in the second stage compared to the first one?'\n[That information cannot be disclosed as of now since it would take a few hours for the system to upgrade. As for the requirement to reach that stage, the host needs to reach a hundred points in the overall progression.]\nAustin hummed, he somehow guessed it.\nWith the current rate, he would become a B-rank once he conquered this dungeon...or maybe the one after this one.\nHe couldn't be sure since there was no parameter he could use to keep a record of his status.\n'I think it would be best to search for a beast to hunt.'\nAfter a bit of thought, Austin asked, \"Can I request another dungeon right after this one?\"\n[Ding!]\n[In exchange for 300 points, the host can request the Second Dungeon instantaneously.]\n[Note: Further, the cost of the dungeon generation will rise as the Host continues to progress.]\n'....' Austin was a bit taken aback by that huge amount being asked.\nHe fought with his life on the line for an hour to earn those points and now, the system was asking it so simply just for doing its job.\n'...and what if I don't spend my points?'\n[Then the host would have to wait for the system to randomly summon a dungeon, like the first time.]\n'...and how many days that may take?'\n[From one day to one year.]\n\"...\" This is just purely asking him to sacrifice those hard-earned points. Sigh.\nSo he has to utilize those points since before the tournament, he needs to make sure he has reached B-rank. Well, he won't get his rank officially evaluated, but he surely would need that strength to not lose against the opponent; Headmaster Philius would choose for him.\n'System, is there any reward for my Shard to upgrade?'\n[Your Shard is a part of your Soul, and your Soul Energy is progressing alongside your Combat stats.]\nAustin hummed; understandable.\nThe evolution of his Soul Shard would allow him to realize his affinity with an element.\nAlthough he was more suitable as a fighter, having a few spells would allow him to remain versatile during a battle.\n\"Austin?\" The blond Prince jerked out of his daze as he looked to his left and found Rudolph standing there.\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"You...free? I want to discuss something with you.\"\nHe sounded serious, which made Austin curious. However, when he looked to the other side, he found Valerie standing there, uncertainty written on her face.\n\"Is it okay if I invite Valerie along?\"\nRudolph glanced where Austin's eyes were directed before he assented, \"Yeah, sure.\"\n\"Where are you going? Can I also come?\" Rhea suddenly appeared before them as she asked with a soft smile.\nRudolph looked troubled, and from his expression alone Austin guessed what it could be.\nThat's why he suggested, \"Don't you have some training to finish? Why don't you wait for Valerie in the training ground?\"\nRhea understood that the matter could not be shared with her, and as such, she smilingly said, \"Okay, then, see you guys around.\"\nRudolph felt extremely bad letting her go. He generally doesn't hide anything from her....but informing her about this would only increase the mental burden on the girl.\nRhea was already too stressed because of her recent defeat, and the upcoming tournament. As such, Rudolph didn't want to add another source of stress to her.\nAustin urged, \"Shall we go?\"\nRudolph nodded before Austin approached his lover and extended his hand toward her.\n\"Is everything all right?\" Valerie asked as she held his hand.\nThe familiar warmth made her heart flutter, but she chose to not let her get distracted.\n\"Rudolph has some news to share...possibly about the Capital.\"\nRudolph's father was the Commander of the Imperial Legion and someone who was an integral part of the council. As such, Austin guessed it must be about the Council or something that happened in the capital that caused Rudolph so much anxiety.\nIf he was guessing it right, then Drenovar must have made some moves.\nThey followed the bigger guy to the garden since the Common Hall must be too crowded to talk peacefully.\nThe back garden of the campus was not completely devoid of the populace, but surely, it wasn't as noisy.\nAs they reached the resting bench, Austin noticed the dust and dried leaves settled on the bench.\nTaking out his handkerchief, he cleaned the seat for Valerie before gesturing for her to sit down.\n\"Thank you.\"\nAustin smiled at the girl before dusting off the seat for himself as well and sitting beside her.\nRudolph, whose seat was still covered with dust, stared at his friend in betrayal, \"Seriously dude, you chose your lover and forgot about your bro?\"\nAustin shrugged as Rudolph took out his handkerchief, and after cleaning his seat, he also sat down.\n\"So what is it?\" Austin asked.\nRudolph made sure that no one was listening to their conversation before he asked, \"Did you recently receive any letter from your mother or brother?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"No, what happened?\"\nRudolph frowned, a little troubled about the fact how blatantly they were ignoring him, even about these important family matters.\nIn a grim voice, he said, \"Your father might not be well. He looked extremely pale and weak during the recent council meeting. Maybe it was because of the stress but his case is quite concerning.\"\nAustin had a severe frown on his face; this was unexpected.\nThis wasn't part of the plot, but maybe—because of Drenovar and the strain of the war—it had started to take a toll on him.\nHowever, something told Austin that this wasn't just the stress.\n'Is Aiden planning to remove father...but as of now, even if the King dies he wouldn't receive the throne right away....' The most annoying trait of the first Prince was his unpredictable nature.\nHe can never predict Aiden's next move because of his twisted nature. As such, it wouldn't be a surprise that he might have targeted his father to gain control over Eryndor.\n\"Austin...I think you should go and meet him. You might have grudges against him, but he is your father.\" Rudolph added, sounding resolute.\nAustin wasn't surprised that Rudolph was suggesting something like this despite being aware of how Austin have been treated by his family in the past few years.\nThe close bond he shares with his family, especially his father, makes Rudolph believe that family members should always forgive each other, regardless of what crime they might have committed.\n'More than any familial feelings I might have for that man, I need him as the King to not let Eryndor meet its demise.'\nAustin couldn't let the King fall or Eryndor will fall. And that would be disastrous in several ways.\n\"Austin...\" Hearing her soft voice, Austin turned to look at her.\nValerie had a concerned look on her face as she asked him wordlessly, what he wanted to do.\nReleasing a long long breath, he finally made the decision, \"After my trials, I will go and seen him.\"\n---------**--------\nA/N:- We are approaching towards the downfall. Not of Eryndor, but of a certain silver-headed bastard.\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Chapter 74- Change of plans?\n\"Are you returning to your room?\" Austin asked as they stood near the girl's dorm.\nIt was already past dinner time and they have spent most of their time together.\nIt was strange yet not that when you are with your favorite person, you don't realize when time passes.\n\"I…have to,\" Valerie responded as she held his hands and stood face to face.\nAustin heaved a sigh and nodded, \"Well, tomorrow is our trial and we will get to know who I will be facing to be with you.\"\nValerie shyly lowered her gaze, her beautiful lips arching in a smile, as she said, \"But we are already together.\"\nAustin shook his head, \"Tomorrow, I am going to win the place beside you.\"\nValerie looked up into his eyes; the determination and confidence he held made her heart flutter.\nHow time changes. Once, he only seemed so determined about only one person—Rhea. But now, his focus, and goal was her.\nIt was his ambition to be with her.\nValerie squeezed his hand and uttered, \"I know you will win tomorrow.\"\nHearing that, Austin mischievously grinned, before asking, \"But if I win, I will naturally get to participate with you. What will you give me?\"\nValerie was confused, her head tilted slightly, as she asked, \"What…I can give you?\"\nAustin inched closer. His breath made her ticklish, as she held her breath upon finding the distance between their lips almost non-existent.\nShe was suddenly reminded of that moment when they kissed, further elevating her panic.\n\"A-Au-Austin…I-I-I…\"\nAustin looked into her beautiful trembling eyes. Her body was trembling in both nervousness and anticipation.\nLeaning his face to the side a little, he whispered in her ear, \"If I win tomorrow, I want to have the taste of your sweet lips, once again.\"\nValerie's eyes stretched slightly, as she opened her mouth to say something, only to find her Lord's finger pressing against her lips, \"I won't take anything but 'yes' as a response.\"\nValerie wasn't going to reject him anyway, but still…why should she be the one to kiss? She even became shameless for the first time.\n'...it's the reward he is asking for though…' Valerie steeled her nerves, and with her eyes closed, she nodded in assent.\nAustin smiled before he stepped back, \"Go and rest, Valerie. Tomorrow will be a tiring day for you.\"\n—------**--------\n\"Shit…that might have been too much…\" Returning to his room, Austin clutched his chest and found his heart violently beating.\nHis face was hot, and whenever he remembered the expression on his lover's face, he felt his mind turning numb and a shiver of excitement running down his spine.\n'She looked so timid and adorable…' One couldn't comprehend how such a fierce and cold warrior could make such an expression when he flirts with her.\n\"I can't let anyone else see that expression or they will fall for her right away…\" Flirting is okay, but he can't do that outside.\n*Knock*\nHearing the knock, Austin first steadied his breathing before opening the door and finding a familiar grey-haired man standing there.\n\"Good evening, sir.\" Sebastian greeted as he entered the room.\n\"Sebastian…did you know about Father?\" Austin asked right away. Although he heard the news from Rudolph, he couldn't be a hundred percent sure until his trusted butler affirmed.\nAnd indeed, \"He is not doing well, sir. I received the news from a trusted source.\"\nAustin hummed, a deep frown marring his face as he sat down on the chair and rested his hand on the table.\nAfter thinking for a bit, Austin asked, \"What information do you have about the staff regularly working in the palace?\"\n\"I have details about everyone,\" Sebastian responded. For someone who used to serve the king, it was his duty to keep a record of those who regularly came in contact with Cedric.\nAustin grimly asked, \"What do you know about the chef working in the kitchen? Do they have a family?\"\nSebastian was confused, \"There are currently three chefs and seven cooks in the royal kitchen. And yes, they have their families except for the youngest cook who recently joined. He is an orphan.\"\nAustin hummed, before he asked, \"I know it is too much, but can you do a background check on all these, especially the new one for me? I might be paranoid but I feel Father's sudden health deterioration is not just out of stress.\"\nAustin could only trust Sebastian with this work. He doesn't have the resources or manpower to do this job. And if Sebastian finds Aiden's involvement in this matter then it would be quite beneficial for Austin.\n\"If possible…huh?\" Austin was surprised to see the butler, despite the severity of the matter, was smiling warmly at him.\nSebastian explained, \"It warms my heart to see you being worried for your Father, despite the distance you two may have created.\"\nAustin sighed. Interlacing his fingers, he said, \"I am worried about the nation and our people. If the King falls, I hardly believe my elder brother could handle the responsibilities of the throne as of now.\"\n\"Yes, yes, I understand you,\" Sebastian said; however, seeing how the man was grinning, it was evident that he didn't believe in him at all.\nAustin groaned, \"You really are…well, if possible, find out about them by the day after tomorrow.\"\nSebastian nodded diligently, \"Understood, sir. And…is there any change in plans for our trip?\"\nAustin nodded, \"We will first visit the Great Forest, then meet Duke Corwon, and finally visit the capital. Since there would be fifteen days before the tournament officially begins, I think we can cover the journey in that brief time.\"\nSebastian was a little concerned, \"But sir, if we visit the Capital-\"\n\"I know that we won't make it to Drenovar on time. That's why I am planning to postpone the trip…\" but was that a wise choice? Austin was racing against time.\n—------**-------\n\"Based on the decision of the council, Eryndor and Drenovar might not get the permission to participate.\"\nHearing those words from the Headmaster, a few didn't react and a few gasped.\nIt was late evening when the meeting of the teachers was held in the conference room where the Headmaster, Vice-headmaster along with other teachers were present.\nThe topic in discussion was, naturally, the tournament.\n\"Is it because of the possible war, sir?\" One of the teachers asked, and he got a nod in response.\n\"Indeed. Although we haven't received any notice from the Union Council, it is being speculated that they would not allow the academy of the two nations who are on the verge of a clash, to participate.\"\n\"But what war has to do with this tournament?\" Another Professor asked.\nThis time, it was Morkel who responded, \"There are several reasons, Professor Dorothy, but the most obvious one is personal grudge and manipulation. While we may not instruct our students to target those from Drenovar, who's to say they wouldn't encourage theirs to use this opportunity to take revenge on Eryndor?\"\nDorothy raised her brows, \"Are you suggesting that they will ask their students to harm our students.\"\nMorkel shrugged, \"Who knows.\"\nEvery eye then turned towards the Headmaster, before Philius added, \"Professor Morkel is right about that. That's why, it isn't safe for us to send our students inside the ring where they gain the opportunity to severely damage our students.\"\nThe Vice-headmaster asked, \"So are we withdrawing?\"\nPhilius shook his head, \"Unless the Union Council doesn't tell us so, we are going to move with our original plan. We will hold the trials as scheduled and see what happens.\"\nMorkel exhaled a weary sigh as he said, \"All we can do is hope for a miracle.\"\n—-------**---------\nIt was quite late at night when Austin finally finished his planning about the upcoming trip to places.\nHe would be quite busy for some time now, however, this was necessary.\nIf the First Prince hadn't made a move towards Valerie, Austin might have used Aiden for his benefit. However, now….Aiden needs to die.\n'If things don't go in the way I desire them to be…then I always have a plan B…' Austin looked at the small pocket watch Sebastian gifted him. If he fails then directly slaughtering Aiden would be the only option left for him.\n'Haah…let's think about that later…' He has a more important thing in hand right now. His training.\nTomorrow was his trial, and the Headmaster would be choosing his opponent. If Austin wins against him then he can have his spot reserved as an Elite.\nThat's why…\n'System, re-open Stage 1…'\n[Ding!]\n[Re-establishing the stage…]\n[Floor 1: Moonlit Mirage]\n[Rank: C-]\n[Time limit: 6 hours]\n[Current points: 205]\n[Enter?]\n[Y/N]\nTaking a deep breath, Austin summoned his Shard in his left hand before commanding,\n\"Yes.\"\n—------**--------\nA/N:- I hope you all are enjoying the story so far.

      "content": "Chapter 76: Chapter 75- You are needed\nThe greatest happiness of a warrior is not to buy new equipment, rather, it is to find themselves progressing.\nJust like how Austin was feeling currently.\n*CLANG*\n*SWAAAH*\nHia dagger parried the incoming blade before his fist dug a hole in the chest of the ninja, ceasing its existence in one blow.\nThe blond Prince didn't stay there to marvel at his strength. Rather, he twirled on his feet, ducking low to dodge the incoming saber, before he plunged his elongated dagger into the ninja.\n*SWAAAH*\nIf it was difficult for Austin to keep track of the dungeon dwellers when he entered the dungeon for the first time, then now, he was easily able to track their movements and react on time.\nHis reflexes and strength have elevated thanks to the progression he made yesterday.\n*CLANG*\nSparks flew as Austin twisted his wrist, knocking aside another blade before driving his knee into the attacker's ribs. The soldier barely had time to stagger before Austin's dagger flashed—slicing cleanly through its throat.\nHe didn't stop. He couldn't.\nAnother enemy lunged from the shadows, but Austin was faster. He ducked, feeling the wind of a blade passing over his head, then shot up like a spring, slamming his dagger into the ninja's chin. The force sent it flying back before it even had the chance to react.\n*SWISH*\nAustin tilted his head just in time as a blade passed from the spot, before the blond Prince grabbed the attacker's wrist, twisting it before pulling the assailant in front.\nAustin held the other hand of the ninja, before kicking it with enough force to send its body flying while its hands remained in Austin's captive.\nThe ninja dissolved into nothingness before Austin continued to parry and counter whoever came in his way\nUnlike before when they were coming in waves, now, they were attacking altogether.\nFrom a different angle, it would have seemed horrifying to see a single human being surrounded by more than two hundred ambushers.\nHowever, Austin didn't let that information overwhelm his mind. Until he could see, he could fight.\n*RUMBLE*\nThe swarm closed in.\nBlades flashed from every direction.\nAustin moved.\nCLANG! He parried a sword, sidestepped a spear, then thrust—his dagger sinking into a ninja's chest before he tore it out in a violent arc, severing another's head in the same motion.\nBut they kept coming.\nAustin moved his eyes restlessly on the battlefield, tracking the incoming enemies one after another.\nJust as he found his body was getting a little slower, Austin jumped over the attack and landed on one of the soldier's shoulder\nJumping high into the air, Austin summoned his beloved boomerang before throwing it towards the lot.\nThe moment Wisp left his hand, the air howled.\n*SHHHHK*\nThe boomerang shot forward like a ghostly blade, cutting clean through the first row of enemies. It didn't stop. It twisted mid-air, curving back toward Austin before veering sideways—tearing through another dozen ninjas in a single arc.\nLimbs flew. Bodies dissolved into black mist.\nAustin was brought down to the ground, as he landed with his elongated Shard piercing through the head of the ninja below him.\n*Dhak*\nAustin landed on the ground before ducking his head and extending his Shard enough to stab the nearby soldiers.\n*SHWAAAA*\nAustin continued to move restlessly around the ground, dominating the field with his speed and strength.\nSlowly, the number went down, and his points continued to go up.\n'Just a little more...'\n----------**----------\n[A little while ago]\nMorkel was in his office, arranging his notes and documents.\nFor the next month, he wasn't scheduled for regular classes, that's why he was planning to arrange all his documents in his free time.\n'Ah...' He suddenly found a certain letter that brought back a few memories.\n'How can I forget about this...' A nostalgic smile formed on his lips.\nHe joined the academy at the age of twenty-two—just right after he finished his diploma.\nInitially, he wasn't well accepted by the students, and despite his knowledge, he was told to teach the first year rather than the third.\nFrom the Headmaster's perspective, Morkel needed some experience in the initial phase.\nHe didn't mind; he knew he had to become mature enough to handle mature students.\nHowever, because of a lack of experience, he often made many mistakes in his initial days. He was clumsy and easily got intimidated. And because the Headmaster praised him, the other Professor didn't like him much, so he was left alone to sort it out all by himself.\nAfter one year, Morkel felt that he might not be good as a teacher. The students never took him seriously, and the other teachers only looked at him with pity.\nHe was tired...wanted to cry. He was a man, that's why he wasn't allowed to even cry in the open. And because he was an illegitimate child, there was no one to listen to his troubles.\nThat's why, one day he decided to resign from his job and become a researcher. Although that job wouldn't have paid well, at least he would get freedom from all this pressure.\nOne of those evenings when he was making his way to the Headmaster's office, carrying his resigning letter in his hand, he suddenly stumbled into a certain pinkhead who recently joined the academy.\nThe letter from his hand dropped to the ground and before he could have picked it up, the girl crouched down to pick the letter.\nHer brows were raised when she read the subject of the matter before she looked up at the Professor.\nMorkel was quite embarrassed at that time since, because of his clumsiness, he wouldn't be able to leave in silence as well.\nHowever, the girl didn't say anything regarding that and just handed the letter to him.\n\"T-Thank you...\" Morkel, while stuttering, thanked the polite girl.\nThe girl didn't respond to that; rather, while looking at him in the eyes, she uttered, \"I loved your lectures...the only person whom I can understand in this academy. But I guess, it's a tradition for everyone I like to leave one day.\" Heaving a sigh, she added, \"Anyway, farewell, teacher.\"\nMorkel was rendered speechless. He was never told that they loved his lectures...nor was he told that his presence was needed by someone.\nBeing practically an orphan, he has long lost the sensation of being liked by someone. To be needed by someone.\nHe remained rooted in his spot for a long time...before he turned around and decided not to resign.\nHe joined the academy because of his hobby of teaching...however, the reason he stayed was different. He stayed for a certain student.\nRhea.\n'Haah...some people might call me a creep...but only I know how pure my feelings are for you...' Looking at the only picture he had in his diary, Morkel exhaled a long breath.\nHe didn't know if she would ever accept him or not...however, until his last breath, Morkel had taken an oath to protect that smile on her face.\nAnd to keep her smiling, there was someone who needed to disappear.\nAustin.\n---------**--------\n\"Haah....haah....haah...fuck...\" Austin collapsed on the ground. His Shard disintegrated, and his boomerang returned to his inventory as the teenager remained lying within the resting zone.\nHe finally defeated all the two hundred and fifty soldiers.\nInitially, it was too easy...making him believe that it would be a piece of cake. However, soon he realized that, unlike a video game where you can spam moves against mobs, here things were different.\nHis opponents might be mindless creatures, but they still possessed the instincts of warriors.\nIt took a lot from him—seven slashes, fifteen bruises, and a broken tooth to defeat all of them.\nHowever, thanks to all that hard work and pain, he was able to earn something very valuable,\n[Total Points: 205-> 270]\nAustin was slightly dissatisfied. The reason was the reduction of points per soldier as he advanced.\nFor the first hundred soldiers, it was 0.4.\nFor the next hundred, it went down to 0.2.\nAnd the next fifty, 0.1.\n'You are such a cheapstake, system.'\nHeaving a sigh, Austin got up from the ground but remained seated.\nHis legs were trembling as he looked at the timer.\n[10:31]\nThere were still ten minutes left for him to rest. However, considering the being he needs to fight, these ten minutes were far too less.\n[Name: Commander Red Wing]\n[Rank: B-]\nAustin exhaled a weary breath, 'Wasn't this dungeon supposed to be filled with just C-ranks?'\n[Ding!]\n[Indeed, host. However, after calculating the time it took for the host to defeat all the soldiers, and the stats progression the host earned, the Boss level was increased accordingly.]\n\"...\" This was like asking him how much he tries to farm EXP through mobs, the dungeon boss would always be a rank higher than him.\n'Well, not like I am here for an easy battle.' Tearing his shirt sleeve, he wrapped it around his wounded elbow.\nOnce done, Austin got up and summoned his weapon.\nThe timer ticked towards the zero, as Austin prepared himself.\n'Just for the last time...'\n*Bzzz*\nThe buzzer echoed as Austin took a step forward—only to find his vision turning blurry.\n\"Huh...\"\n---------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

A shiver ran down his spine as he looked at his opponent.\nIts eyes, glowing red like burning embers, locked onto him with an overwhelming presence. Black smoke curls from where its mouth should be, hiding its face in darkness. The sheer force of its stare made the air feel heavier as if crushing him under its will.\nAustin could feel his body growing sluggish from the effect, and to make matters worse, the last blow had snapped a couple of his ribs.\n*CLINK*\nThe soldier's foot shifted, the air tensed, and under Austin's widened gaze, the Commander lunged.\n\"Fuck!\" Panic surged through him as he hastily chanted, the Absolute Barrier flaring to life around his body.\n*CLANG*\nThe knight's fist crashed against the glowing shield, sending sparks flying—but the attack failed to reach him.\nGritting his teeth, Austin seized the opening, driving his fist forward with every ounce of strength left in him.\n**THWACK**\nA shockwave burst from behind the knight as it was pushed backward.\nAustin grinned. The barrier would last thirty seconds—until then, he was untouchable.\nAustin wasted no time. The moment the knight staggered back, he lunged forward, fists clenched, driving into the opening like a relentless storm.\n**BAM**\nHis punch slammed into the knight's chest plate, forcing it back another step. But the knight barely reacted—no flinch, no grunt of pain—just those burning red eyes staring him down.\nAustin gritted his teeth.\nThis wasn't enough.\n\"Wisp!\" He called out, and instantly something hit the knight on its back, making it stumble forward.\n*SWISH*\nTaking the opportunity, Austin summoned his dagger and plunged it forward.\nHowever,\n*CLANG*\nJust in time, the knight held the blade from piercing its awakened chest plate. And just in time, the barrier went down,\n\"Shi-*BOOOOM*\"\nA bone-cracking punch landed on his gut, sending Austin flying back—losing hold of his dagger as he did.\nAustin ducked low and dug into the ground to grab something, or he would hit the wall once again.\n*SCREECH*\nHis nails dugs, broke, and bled, but he finally brought himself to a pause before lunging forward.\nSummoning his dagger in his hand, he elongated it to make it a sword, only to find something astonishing,\n\"Fuck!\" Austin had to stop his charge, as suddenly the Knight summoned its own long sword as well and slashed towards Austin.\n*SWISSH*\nUnder Austin's widened gaze, the blade's tip passed by a hair's breadth.\nAt that moment, Austin truly felt the dread for his life.\n**CRACK**\nThe blade struck into the ground, creating cracks on the tile as Austin leaped away.\n\"*Huff* *Huff*\" Austin felt a chill running down his spine. His face was pale as he stared at the knight who had dominated him both physically and mentally.\n'This is bad...that could have split my head...' Austin was horrified.\nThat was the moment when Austin felt that this was not within his power to defeat this guy right now...he was too strong for the current him.\n[Does the Host want to retreat?]\n[Y/N]\nAustin was about to say yes. He might need to defeat two hundred and fifty soldiers once again, but the next time he could come more prepared and with a strategy\nHe didn't have the barrier and he was too injured to even stand properly.\n'Ye-' He was about to give the command when suddenly, he began to feel lighter. The invisible weight from his body was removed as he was notified,\n[Note: Your opponent has disabled the effect of 'Withering Gaze'!]\n[Note: All your stats have returned to normal.]\nAustin's expression turned blank as he turned towards the Commander.\nUnlike before when there was indifference oozing from those red glowing eyes, now there was a definite emotion Austin could sense from those eyes.\nPity.\n....\nAt that moment, something was hurt. Any part of his body wasn't as wounded as his ego right now.\nAustin snapped.\n*BOOOM*\nAustin directly charged, making it seem like he was coming in full force. Predictably, the knight raised its massive sword to intercept him—just as he planned.\nAt the last second, Austin twisted his body mid-lunge, letting his foot slide across the cracked tiles as he abruptly lowered his center of gravity. Instead of clashing head-on, he darted toward the knight's side.\nThe knight's sword swung straight through empty air.\nAustin's dagger split in two, and with precise, surgical movements—\n**THWACK!**\nHe struck the knight's back knee joint with the blunt end of his weapon.\nCRACK!\nThe knight staggered, its stance crumbling as its knee buckled.\nAustin grinned before he wrapped his leg around the Knight's neck, and before the knight could get up, Austin used both of his hands to plunge the dagger into the Knight's back.\n**THWANG**\nThere was a loud noise, and this time, the armor of the warrior crumbled.\n**RUMBLE**\nThe aura of the knight flared as it instantly got up on its feet, and after grabbing Austin by his collar, he removed the blond from its body and threw Austin like a ragdoll.\nAustin slid on his feet and grabbed his WhisperWing from the ground.\n*DHAK* *DHAK*\nThe knight advanced towards Austin, its sword raised high, but then, something came flying in its way, that left the Commander with no option but to swat the boomerang away.\nBig mistake.\nJust as the boomerang disappeared from its sight, the knight found the human levitating mid-air with his fist cocked.\nFor the first time, panic appeared in the Commander's eyes, but it was too late,\n**BOOOOOOM**\nWith the strength that counted every single Combat point, Austin landed the blow on the Knight's jaw, sending it sliding back.\nAustin landed on the ground, his knuckles aching, but there was a grin on his face.\nHowever, soon, that grin was wiped off,\n\"*KHWAAAAAAAAAKH*\" The knight suddenly came to a halt before howling in anger as its black aura flared like a stormy sky.\nAustin's eyes narrowed as he had only a split second to summon his Shard and block the incoming attacks\n**CLANG**\nSparks exploded as Austin barely parried the knight's relentless strike. The sheer force sent tremors down his arms, his muscles screaming in protest. His feet dug into the cracked tiles, the pressure nearly making his knees buckle.\nThe knight pressed on, its movements sharp and refined. Its massive sword moved like a whirlwind, each slash carrying the weight of a battle-hardened warrior.\n**SWISH—CLANG—CLANK**\nAustin struggled to keep up. His blade deflected the knight's attacks just enough to avoid fatal damage, but not enough to retaliate. The knight's superior strength was evident—every exchange forced Austin to retreat, barely able to catch his breath before another attack came barreling his way.\nSuddenly—\n*SLASH*\nA shallow cut opened on Austin's side as he failed to evade in time. Blood seeped through his torn shirt, but he clenched his jaw, ignoring the pain.\nThe knight capitalized on the opening.\n**WHOOSH—BOOM**\nAustin barely twisted his body, narrowly avoiding a downward strike that shattered the ground where he once stood.\n'Shit, he's too strong...' Austin gritted his teeth. Every attack was relentless, calculated, and designed to crush him.\nBut—\nHe was getting faster.\nHis arms no longer trembled as much with each clash. His feet found more stability on the shattered ground. His parries became cleaner, his counters more precise.\nThe knight swung diagonally—a perfect execution.\nAustin didn't block.\nInstead, he sidestepped—his body moving on instinct like he had fought this battle before.\nThe blade narrowly missed his chest.\nAustin twisted the blade in hand.\n*CLANG*\nThe armor of the Commander trembled as Austin's Shard made contact.\nFor the first time, Austin's attack connected.\nThe knight flinched.\nAustin's eyes sharpened.\nHe was adapting.\nHis mind pieced together the knight's attack pattern, its timing, its habits. The wide swings, the brief pause before a powerful downward slash—it was all becoming clearer.\nThe next exchange was no longer a desperate survival.\nThe knight slashed—Austin dodged.\nThe knight stabbed—Austin parried.\nThe knight swung low—Austin leaped.\nThe more they fought, the more Austin dictated the rhythm.\nThe Commander, once an unstoppable force, now finds itself unable to overwhelm its opponent.\nAustin's expression shifted.\nThis wasn't just a battle anymore. This was a hunt.\nThe Commander was forced back on its feet as it restlessly swung its blade, but Austin masterfully parried and countered with a strong slash.\nThe armor of the knight was starting to crack from several spots, and the Commander was being pushed back.\n*SLASH*\nIn desperation to make some space, the Commander swung its sword in a horizontal slash; however, Austin had enough time to duck under the attack and punch the Commander with every the strength deriving from each fibre of his body.\n\"*KHWNG*\" Red Wing staggered back, tattered and wounded.\nAustin's blood had long dried as he watched the Commander in pity, \"What are you going to do now?\"\nWhile clutching its wounded stomach, the Commander, in desperation, activated its skill,\n*SHLINK*\nIts eyes began to glow and Austin felt his body turning heavy instantly.\nThe Commander grinned, clutching its sword and ready to end the battle with one final swing.\nHowever, suddenly,\n*SHLINK*\nA heavy invisible force descended upon the Commander. Its eyes widened as it turned to look at Austin...or to be more precise, in his glowing blue eyes.\n[Ding!]\n[Skill Adapt in use!]\n[The Opponent's stats would be lowered significantly!]\nAustin grinned, \"Guess your last option is also devoured.\"\n---------**--------\nA/N:- Took me properly an hour and half to write this.

And my dear Rhea, you don't hide your medals right?'\nAlthough she never reached the venue since a fight broke out and the ceremony was canceled, she lost her hesitation that day.\nAt that time…everything was fine.\nShe deemed Parkinson as her good friend. He always appeared whenever she felt lonely or disoriented. He always said the thing which she desired to hear the most at that moment.\nBut…now she realized that his intentions towards her were never revolving around friendship.\nClenching her fist, she muttered under her breath, \"I wish we never meet again, Park.\"\n—--------**----------\n\"So, are you prepared, my son?\" Zurkis asked with a wide grin on his face and his eyes turned crescent.\nHe was holding a goblet of wine as he sat on the dining table with his wife and son to enjoy the celebratory feast.\n\"Yeah, kinda,\" Parkinson spoke as he slowly ate the meat with all the elegance.\nHis mother, Shafina El Hener, looked at her son and spoke with her eyes narrowed, \"That get-up has ruined your looks. I am displeased.\"\nThe lady has long, flowing, pale purple hair and sharp green eyes. A mole under her left eye added charm to her looks. And top of it, a figure that could make a man drool.\nBeing such a beauty, she always cared about her son's looks and aesthetics. That's why this disguise made her feel unpleasant.\n\"You haven't pursued someone in life, that's why you won't know,\" Parkinson replied.\nShafina chuckled, \"I had men running behind me all their lives, but I only chose the wealthiest one. It's all come to whom you find most advantageous to you, in life.\"\nParkinson rolled his eyes, \"Calling yourself a gold-digger is wild.\"\nShafina giggled as she held her husband's hand and added, \"I did fall for this man later, but initially, it was all about his worth.\"\nZurkis kissed the back of her hand to show his affection for the woman he had ever allowed himself to love.\nWith her eyes turning serious, she looked at her son, and told him, \"That's why, Son, you need to think first—is this girl really worth your attention-\"\n*CLANG*\nParkinson broke the plate in two with the fork as he stared at his mother dead in the eye.\n\"Rhea isn't a thing, whose worth I will evaluate. Even if she had been crippled and the ugliest girl in the world, I still would have chosen her.\"\nSaying so, Parkinson got up from the table and walked away.\nZurkis heaved a sigh, \"Dear, I told you to not talk about that girl.\"\nShafina casually stabbed her fork into the small tomato and said, \"I just wanted to see how mad he is for that girl.\"\nWith her eyes holding a subtle killing intent, she added, \"And now that I have seen how far he can go for her, as his mother, it's my duty to not let anyone come between them.\"\nZurkis raised his brows, \"Have you thought of something?\"\nShafina grinned, \"This brat, Austin, who framed our son…do you think I will let him off the hook so easily?\"\nThe woman suddenly took out a folded parchment with the official stamp of El Hener present on it.\nZurkis frowned before taking the parchment from the woman as he heard her saying,\n\"We will offer Eryndor a helping hand during this time of crisis. We will provide military supplies at lower rates because this is an emergency situation. And more so, we can even provide the high-grade potions which are Hener's specialty.\"\nWith a malicious grin extending her lips, she added, \"And in exchange, they only exile a certain Prince.\"\n------**------\n*Knock*\nSebastian frowned. This was the second time he knocked but his master hadn't responded yet.\n*Knock*\nA third time. Even if he had been in the bathroom he would have called out to wait.\nUsing his authority as his guardian, he unlocked the door and walked inside, \"Young Master-\"\nHowever, the sight awaiting inside completely baffled Sebastian.\n\"U-Umm…\" Valerie's face couldn't have been any more redder as she remained tightly encaged in her Lord's arms.\n….\nTo explain the situation, let's go back three hours in time,\nValerie had an appointment with her Lord at the training ground to do some final touch-ups and discuss their plans.\nShe was waiting for him until half past the designated time, yet he didn't arrive.\nIt was uncommon for Austin to arrive late, which made Valerie worried.\nSeveral thoughts began disturbing her, and in the end, she ended up sneaking inside his room.\n\"Hmm?\" However, she was surprised to find that he was doing the most obvious thing that made him late.\nSleeping.\nHis peacefully sleeping face was quite calming and fascinating.\nDuring the battle, he always makes such an intense face that leaves Valerie all hot and bothered. She always feels that if he ever commands her to even jump into a river with that expression, she would obediently do so.\nAnd when he is with her, that warm smile never leaves his face. That expression gives her a very fuzzy feeling and wants to make her cherish the moment.\n\"Hmm?\" Without noticing she was a lot closer to his face than a maiden should be.\nHer face began to get hot by his breath as she gazed at those thin lips. That reminded her of that kiss she shared with him for the first time.\nThat was her first kiss. And she will always remember it since, as going against her manners, she kissed her Lord on her initiative.\nSlowly bringing her fingers toward his lips, she wanted to touch them, when suddenly,\n*Clench*\nEven while soundly asleep, Austin grabbed her hand and under Valerie's widened gaze, she was pulled to the bed.\n\"You aren't escaping…until…I am satisfied…\"\nAs such, as a dutiful wife, she didn't try to escape.\n…\nAnd now,\n\"Fufu~sorry for this old one to disturb the two love birds.\" Sebastian chuckled before he gave a slight bow and walked out of the room.\nValerie was on the verge of dying of embarrassment!\n\"Mm…don't go…\"\n…or maybe, she will live, thanks to her Lord.\n—--------**------------\nA/N:- Valerie is just a floofy plush for Austin.

      "content": "Chapter 79: Chapter 78- Switch sides\n\"I....apologize. I was too tired and sleepy to notice.\" It was rare for Austin to appear so apologetic. However, today, his action was quite bothersome.\nHe returned all tired last night and fell asleep, and when in the morning, Valerie came to get him for training, he didn't get up and even pulled Valerie to sleep beside him.\n\"No, no...you don't need to...I-I don't mind...\" Valerie assured him that it was okay since she didn't like how her Lord was feeling bad for hugging her in his sleep.\nWell, it was true that she wasn't able to calm her heart even for a moment in those hours, but she never felt displeasure from his embrace.\nIf anything, she wanted to remain always there...\nAustin heaved a sigh, as he slowly sliced the pancake and told her, \"I have a very bad habit of clinging to something in my sleep, so if it happens in the future, please wake me up.\"\nValerie's cheeks were tainted with some redness as she nodded....however, truth be told, she wasn't ever going to wake him up if he ended up embracing her like that again.\nThe atmosphere between them finally returned to normal once Austin gained her forgiveness. He really needs to do something about his habits.\nThe classes were suspended today, all the students have already gathered in the training hall, which explains why the common hall was so empty.\nAustin went to ask for his match, and it turned out that it was scheduled for the evening. Valerie's match would be in the afternoon.\n\"Are you prepared?\" Valerie asked as she scooped some cereal and brought them to her lips.\nAustin exhaled a sigh, \"I think I am prepared but let's see what opponent I get to face.\" Austin wasn't sure where he stands right now. His skills have developed and more than anything, his senses have sharpened.\nNow, whether these things would help him win the match or not was another matter.\nDuring the selection match, he wouldn't be able to use his 'Absolute Barrier' given the thirty hours haven't elapsed since he last used it. And second, he couldn't just out of nowhere use a skill.\nSurely, he could use WhisperWing, but the Stopwatch was out of the question, given he wouldn't be able to recharge it for a month. And Austin has a more significant requirement for that Stopwatch.\nWhile eating, Austin suddenly realized that his left hand was still quite shaky after the battle against the Commander. Just a single intense life-threatening battle Austin has gone through, and he was so shaken up.\nLooking up at Valerie, he couldn't help but ask, \"How did you do it?\"\nValerie blinked in confusion before asking, \"I don't understand?\"\nAustin, with a smile, asked her, \"To become this strong...you surely must have gone through several difficult trials. How did you manage everything?\"\nValerie was slightly taken aback by the sudden interest in her days of struggle.\nShe looked at the sincere admiration in his eyes and felt her heart accelerating.\n\"I...don't know if I should be receiving such high praises from you-\"\n\"Of course, you should. It wasn't like you awakened the Third Evolution just by sitting at home and doing nothing. I have seen how hard you used to work in the past that made you what you are right now.\"\nWith her eyes drawn to the table, Valerie slowly muttered, \"....and that hard work created distance between us.\"\nValerie said that, but instantly regretted it. With her eyes widened, she looked up at Austin and shook her head, \"No, I don't mean-\"\n\"It's okay, Val.\" Austin held her hand, and assured her, \"I understand what you meant.\"\nExhaling a breath that contained both frustration and weariness, he said, \"I was....jealous of seeing you achieve what I could never.\"\n\"But it's not true. I can see that you are progressing now, and in no time you will go through an Evolution.\" Valerie added, and she was not saying sweet words just because of her feelings for him.\nShe has seen him going through phases in his life—from summoning his Shard to coming this far, he has suffered a lot and worked harder than anyone else.\nAustin smiled at her, feeling his shoulders, which were stiff because of nervousness, finally relaxing when her familiar warmth seeped through his skin and touched his heart.\nHowever, soon he was distracted as Austin caught the sight of a familiar man who did his best to hide himself but failed to do so. Considering Valerie didn't react it was obvious that she didn't notice him, but Austin did.\n\"Val, go ahead and keep a seat for me in the stands. I have some work to finish.\" Austin said as he got up from the seat.\n°°°°°°\nMorkel didn't know why he escaped the common hall when he went there just to buy a sandwich.\n'Maybe it's the side effect of spying so regularly on him...' Morkel was given the task of keeping an eye on Austin and because of that, he eventually got a habit of hiding whenever his eyes landed on the blond Prince.\nSometimes Morkel felt, 'What the hell am I doing...?' but then when he remembered what was at stake, he couldn't stop himself.\n\"Yo, Professor.\" Suddenly, a voice rang from behind which was familiar.\nMorkel narrowed his eyes and turned around, \"Austin.\" He called out.\nThe blond Prince was resting his back against the wall with his hands folded as he called out, \"I was wondering if you could spare some time for me. If only your Lord allows you, that is.\"\nMorkel narrowed his eyes, \"I serve no one.\"\nAustin, with a smile never fading from his face, inches closer to the man, before whispering, \"Then are spying over me for no good reason? I doubt that.\"\n\"Who said I was spying? Are you putting allegations on your teacher?\"\nAustin looked amazed, \"Still going to put on an act? What exactly did Aiden promise you? A well-paid job for Rhea? Or a promotion for you?\" With a grin extending his lips, Austin faintly whispered, \"Or did he promise to find out who killed her parents?\"\nMorkel's eyes widened in shock as he stared at the younger one in disbelief.\nThat reaction alone was enough to confirm that Aiden had indeed promised Morkel the names of those responsible for Rhea's parents' deaths.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"You are so naive, Morkel, to trust a man who was an orphan until a few years ago. Do you think he really knows something so insignificant like an ambush in a small village like Cadstead?\"\nMorkel was further delivered with another shocking blow, \"You know about her hometown?\" Morkel believed that it was only he who knew from where Rhea originally belonged.\nAustin shrugged, \"Not a big issue for me, who has spent years in the council, remained involved with the Ministers, and is served by the man who once served the King.\"\nMorkel narrowed his eyes and was forced to contemplate the credibility of the matter.\nNaturally, there was no record of the ambush in Rhea's hometown. All the information Austin had comes from his last life.\nMorkel remained silent, and that allowed Austin to add, \"I can give you the names and the details. Just switch your loyalty.\"\nMorkel snapped out of his reverie before he looked at Austin in suspicion, \"Why would you share that information with me rather than tell it directly to Rhea?\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Do you still think I am after Rhea? Can't you see I have already moved on by realizing my mistake?\"\nMorkel frowned, \"But...I heard it's all just an act?\"\n\"Heard from whom? Aiden, right?\" Austin heaved a weary sigh, \"Look Morkel, you are being fooled by him. Aiden won't give a single crap even if you die today or something happens to Rhea. All he desires is the throne.\"\nThere was a reason why Austin was going above and beyond to bring Morkel to his side—it's the man's usefulness in the long race.\nHe has a great mind, a great talent, and is easy to manipulate since his weak nerve is in Austin's hold.\nUnlike Parkinson, who can use extreme methods to get rid of people who annoy him or try to harm Rhea, Morkel is much more tamer.\nA long silence descended between them before finally Morkel responded,\n\"Give me some time to think.\"\nAustin nodded, \"Okay, take your time...but I need a response by the evening.\"\nSaying so, the blond one walked away.\nEven if Morkel ends up revealing everything to Aiden, Austin wouldn't receive any damage from it. He was not going to pretend to be all friendly with Aiden, and the information from Morkel wouldn't do a shit to Austin's reputation since, in the Capital, Austin doesn't hold much importance.\n'If he accepts, he stays in the game, and if he doesn't...then Rhea, sorry for your loss.'\n----------**----------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading and showing all the love.

      "content": "Chapter 80: Chapter 79- The perfect plan\n\"Is everything good?\" Valerie asked as Austin approached her in the stands.\nThe blond Prince nodded, \"Yes, everything is fine.\"\nThe audience at the indoor training hall was just purely astonishing.\nAll the students arrived to witness the contest between the students who once trained and learned together but now were competing to get a spot in the tournament.\n\"They are giving it their all,\" Austin commented as he watched the combat between the two participants who were battered and bruised yet not yielding at all.\nNot only the two but the three other arenas had the same view—the participants were going beyond their limits to defeat their opponents.\n\"It can be their chance of a lifetime...especially for the third-year students,\" Valerie added as she remained sitting with a graceful posture and watched the matches with not much interest.\n\"...is it really necessary to drag the match....\" She couldn't help but wonder\nIn one of the four arenas, there was a third-year student who was definitely strong enough to defeat his opponent in a few attacks. Valerie had fought him and his opponent in the past so she knows. However, even that person just keeps dragging on the battle rather than ending it right away.\nAustin scanned the stands until his eyes settled on a particular bracket—a glass-paneled section where two formally dressed individuals sat. With notepads in hand, they watched the matches intently, analyzing every move.\n\"They are dragging it because of them,\" While pointing out at the two individuals, far away from them, Austin spoke.\nValerie's brows tensed, \"That means...I also have to...\"\nAustin nodded, \"Yeah...just don't one-shot your opponent and let them use a few tricks as well.\"\nValerie felt a headache approaching. This was pure stupid. In a real battle, she wouldn't need to wait to see what her opponent could do. Plunging her spear in their chest and butchering them has always been the best option.\n'Feels more like a stage play than a battle....'\nRegardless of her inner monologue, she has no other option but to follow the trend and let her enemy attack her first.\n\"Don't overthink about it, Val. I know you will do just great.\" To soothe her disturbed mind, Austin placed his hand on hers and smiled at the girl fondly.\nAll the building stress melted in an instant under his warm gaze, as she nodded in assent, \"If you say so...\"\n....\nSoon, Valerie got up and said, \"I need to report to the preparation room.\"\nIt was quite peaceful here up in the stands, away from other students and sitting with their hands connected. It felt like they had built a small world out of the chaos, and Valerie was alone with her Lord in that world.\nHowever, unfortunately, she has to go now since her battle is about to start.\n\"Good luck, Val. I will be cheering for you.\" Austin got up and kissed her forehead before whispering, \"Don't get hurt.\"\nAn irresistible smile bloomed on her face as she whispered, \"Understood.\"\n....\nAs Valerie left, Austin sat alone in the back with his feet resting over the seat in front.\n\"System, I have gathered points to unlock the shop, right? What exactly can I get in the shop?\"\n[Unfortunately, host, unless you unlock it, the System couldn't provide any information about the Shop.]\nAustin heaved a weary sigh, this system was unnecessarily secretive sometimes.\nHe was not unlocking the shop because he didn't know what kind of enemy he would be facing during the tournament. Then there was the trip to the Capital as well. And on top of it, to summon another Dungeon he needs points. So unlocking Shop right now was nearly impossible.\n'I need to be patient-'\n\"KYAAAAAAH! ITS LADY VALERIE!\"\n\"SHE FINALLY JOINED THE BATTLE!\"\n\"YEAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!\"\n\"How majestic!\"\n\"She looks like a domineering queen!\"\n\"Wooof...wooof...\"\n\"She is finally here!!\"\nThe booming voice of the audience broke his train of thoughts, as Austin saw his girl walking towards the arena.\n'Despite being a Villainess, she has gained quite a fan following...' Especially after the Demon incident when she bravely stabbed the inhumane, people started hailing her as a War Goddess, Ice Princess, or whatnot.\nAustin sighed in admiration to see that serious eye and cold look.\nThe expression she wore in the morning when he got up and found her in his arms was in completely stark contrast.\nThe flustered Valerie is cute and innocent, which makes him want to corrupt her. And the version of Valerie, who steps into battlefield—cold and calculating—makes him admire her.\n....\nValerie wasn't bothered by all the noise even though, at the moment most of the students were looking at her and cheering for her.\nShe simply stepped onto the arena and looked at her opponent.\nIt was a third-year student, who was also the Captain of the most successful raid team of the school—Ryan Grimshaw. He was possibly the strongest student from the third year and seemed rather confident in his skills by that smirk on his face.\n\"Any other person from the second year, I would have felt disappointed. But with you, I feel honored.\" The black-haired man gave a slight bow to the lady.\nValerie remained silent and waited for the match referee to step inside.\nValerie's eyes traveled towards the bracket where the two judges from the Council sat. She knew that they had a keen interest in her and were looking for an excuse to recruit her.\nFollowing the Headmaster's advice she couldn't use her Disaster-ranked spell under any circumstances. But to be chosen as an Elite in the tournament she has to give it her all as well...\nQuite a dilemma.\n\"Participants, ready?\" The referee stood in the middle of the arena, before asking.\nRyan summoned his battle axe and nodded, \"Ready.\"\nThe air around Valerie turned cold, as she called out, \"Shiverfall.\" The majestic spear appeared in her hand which she held behind her back.\nTaking the battle stance, Valerie nodded, \"Ready.\"\nThe referee looked between the two participants once, before announcing,\n\"Begin!!\"\n----------**---------\n\"Fuck!\" *CLANG*\nThe vase was thrown to the ground, shattering into pieces as Aiden cursed aloud.\n*STOMP* *STOMP*\nEverything was going against the plan. He failed to change Duke Corwon's mind, the plan to send students to the battlefield was rejected, and that damn dog has stopped eating food made in the kitchen!\n**DHAKK**\nDropping the heavy sculpture, he cursed even louder.\n'I was this close to gaining control over the throne...' Aiden didn't plan on murdering the King but rather weakening him, so he gets left with no option other than allowing Aiden to take charge.\nAiden could have easily gained a favorable impression on the council members, and once his position had become prominent in the kingdom, he would have slaughtered the King with his own hands.\nBut, no! The bastard has changed his diet and now only eats what his butler makes for him!\nAiden could never try to bribe the butler or he would be dead for sure. After all, that bastard is Sebastian's brother. And loyalty flows in the blood of that family.\n\"I need to change my plans...that pipsqueak is also about to visit the Capital...\" In Aiden's eyes, Austin was a threat that he could not ignore.\nNot because he was the second Prince, no, no, no. Austin doesn't hold any authority as a Prince at all. Rather, it was his fiancée who could make a big difference.\nAs the daughter of Lord Corwon and also, as an S-rank warrior, her authority becomes prominent in Eryndor.\nAiden was aware of the Council's interest in her ..what if, in exchange for her loyalty, she asked for Austin's nomination for the throne?\nThat weak-ass king named Cedric would immediately jump on the option since gaining support from the Council was the best option for him under these circumstances.\n\"No...I can't let this happen. I need to send someone and assassinate that worthless trash...once he gets out of the way, I will simply conquer his woman, and Cedric will be left with no option but to hand over the throne to me.\"\nIt was risky and difficult to assassinate Austin because of the butler serving him. However, Aiden couldn't think of any other way to gain control over the Kingdom.\n*Knock*\n\"Master Aiden.\" Hearing the voice of the maid, Aiden spoke, \"Not now, Caroline. I am busy.\"\n\"But my Lord, it's important.\" The maid added, making Aiden frown.\nIs the stupid bi*ch tired of living?\nAiden approached the door before revealing himself to the black-haired maid, \"What is it?\"\nThe maid informed, \"A formal letter has arrived from Hener. It seems they have extended an offer.\"\nAiden narrowed his eyes; didn't they pull their hands away from this matter?\nThen why so suddenly...?\n'Interesting,' Stepping out of his room, he commanded, \"Tell someone to clean the room.\"\nCaroline nodded before she opened the door and felt a chill running down her spine.\nBeneath all the broken mess, she could see the dead body of the newly assigned cook, lying in his puddle of blood.\n'Poor soul...'\n--------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Chapter 80- Defeat of the Undedeatable\nThe training hall was engulfed in deep silence.\nAustin's eyes widened in shock, his mouth slightly agape.\nEverything came to a standstill the moment Valerie hit the ground, her spear flung out of the arena.\nIt felt like a dream—because something this unimaginable could only happen in a dream.\nBut this was reality.\nAnd in this reality, Valerie—the undefeated warrior—had fallen after receiving just a single strike from her opponent.\nThe entire audience held their breath, watching in sheer astonishment.\nValerie had started the match with her natural flow, her movements swift and relentless, pushing Ryan into a corner. Her attacks left him barely any room to breathe, and it seemed as though the match was already decided.\nYet, showing the experience as a third year, Ryan somehow managed to maintain a steady pace, preventing himself from getting overwhelmed.\nAnd then, it happened.\nWith a sudden burst of movement, Ryan launched a surprise attack. His blade cut through Valerie's defenses, leaving a deep gash on her left arm. The sharp edge of his strike even tore her shirt slightly.\nBut the most shocking part wasn't the wound—it was Valerie's reaction.\nInstead of retaliating, she collapsed.\n\"Huh?\" A labored breath escaped her lips as she stared at her opponent's feet, her body completely unresponsive.\nRyan exhaled sharply and took a step forward. \"Sorry, Valerie. I can't take any chances, so I'm using my Shard's ability from the start.\"\nHis Shard, Death Fang, had a simple yet terrifying effect—it paralyzed an opponent for several minutes upon tasting their blood.\nRyan had never used this ability against fellow students before. He had always relied on his skill, never on his Shard's full potential. But this time, he had no choice. If he wanted to secure a spot in the upcoming tournament, he had to defeat the best. And to defeat the best, he had to use everything at his disposal.\nValerie clenched her teeth and tried to move. Her fingers trembled as she pressed her hands against the mat, desperately trying to push herself up.\nBut it was futile.\nHer body refused to obey.\nDespite the storm brewing in her mind, she couldn't even lift a finger.\nAustin, watching from the stands, clenched his fists. His body tensed as he watched Ryan approach Valerie. He shifted in his seat, torn between wanting to jump in and help her (which was, of course, against the rules) and trusting her to find a way out.\nThe audience was in disbelief.\nAn S-rank warrior, someone considered nearly unbeatable, had been brought to her knees by someone of a lower rank.\nIt was like watching a towering mountain crumble from a single, well-placed strike.\nRyan finally reached Valerie. He bent down slightly, intending to lift her off the ground to secure his victory.\nHowever, the moment his fingers brushed against her hair—\n**CRACK**\nThe ground beneath the mats fractured as an overwhelming aura erupted from Valerie's body.\nA violent silver storm of energy swirled around her, howling like a raging tempest. The sheer force of her aura made Ryan stumble backward, his arms raised to shield his eyes from the intensity.\nBut he gritted his teeth and forced himself to move forward.\n\"Now or never!\" he roared, determined to end this battle before she could recover.\nWith a fierce battle cry, Ryan raised his foot, aiming to kick Valerie out of the arena.\nJust as his foot swung forward—\n*CLANG*\nA silver spear materialized before him, stopping him just in time. Had he not halted, his foot would have been impaled.\nGasps echoed throughout the training hall.\nControlling one's Shard without even being able to move? That level of mastery was unheard of!\nIn the stands, Rhea stared in disbelief.\nShe could barely keep her sword floating for thirty seconds using mental control alone, yet Valerie—\n\"Shit… such precise control over your Shard?!\" Ryan growled, but a smirk stretched across his lips, excitement flaring in his eyes.\nHe gripped his battle axe tightly and lunged toward Valerie. His opponent was still paralyzed—he just needed to finish the fight.\nFeigning left to avoid the spear, Ryan suddenly twisted right before ducking low.\nHowever—\n**CRACK**\n\"Ghuaagh!!\"\nA tremendous force slammed into him, and his bones cracked under the weight of the augmented Shard. Ryan crashed to the ground, groaning in pain.\nThe audience erupted in cheers, though some winced at the sickening sound of the impact.\nAustin just stood there, in the back, marveling at the sight of a true genius showing how a Shard is actually a part of one's being.\n'She is the true definition of what happens when talent meets hard work.'\nIn the arena, Valerie, barely able to move her eyes, commanded her spear, Shiverfall, to retreat.\nShe needed to finish this.\nHer Shard shot forward once more, aiming straight for Ryan's shoulder. If she could wound him beyond resistance, the match would be over.\nBut she underestimated him.\n*CLANG*\nRyan, without even turning, parried the strike before launching himself back to his feet, still blocking the spear.\n\"That's one tough Shard,\" he muttered, flinging Shiverfall aside.\nThen, gripping his battle axe tightly, he activated his own augmentation.\nThe weapon's size doubled, its sharp edges gleaming menacingly. Coupled with weight amplification, the axe now looked more like an executioner's blade.\n\"But it's not just you who has tricks.\"\nRyan charged at Valerie once again, this time fully prepared.\n*CLANG*\nAs Shiverfall aimed for his head, Ryan swatted it away with the blunt end of his axe.\n'He tracked it?!'\nThe realization struck Valerie with the same force as the kick that came straight from her stomach.\n**DHAK**\nA loud impact resonated as she was sent flying.\nThe audience collectively held their breath as Valerie slid across the mat, heading straight toward the boundary. If she crossed it, the match was over.\nFor two agonizing seconds, everyone watched, waiting for the inevitable.\nThen—\n*Ting*\nHer body stopped.\nA single strand of her hair hovered just above the borderline.\nThe referee immediately raised a hand. \"Safe! Continue!\"\nRyan's eyes widened.\nHe knew he had kicked her with enough force to knock her out of the arena. So then… how?\nHe didn't have time to think.\n\"Forget it,\" he muttered, tightening his grip. He rushed forward to end the match once and for all.\nBut suddenly—\n**SQUELCH**\nPain exploded in his shoulder.\nHis eyes darted down. Shiverfall had impaled him from behind, its icy edge stabbing into the mat and locking him in place.\nFrost rapidly spread over his body as he struggled against the freezing pain.\n\"Aaah!\" Ryan howled, trying to pull the spear out.\nThen—\n\"You won't need to do that.\"\nA cold voice sent a chill down his spine.\nSlowly, he lifted his head and found Valerie staring straight into his eyes.\nThe intent she possessed sent a chill down his spine as Ryan turned motionless instantly.\nThen, just as she lifted her hand, preparing to push herself off the ground—\n\"I surrender.\"\nRyan's voice echoed through the hall.\nSilence followed.\nThen, the entire training hall exploded into an uproar.\nA battle filled with twists and unexpected turns had reached its conclusion.\nAnd in the end, the victory belonged to the one who was expected to win.\n-------**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 82: Chapter 81- Disappointed?\nRyan Grimshaw is a boy born at a noble house but someone who was raised by a hunter after the age of six and was taught everything about a very basic yet necessary concept.\nSurvival.\nBeing pushed into the wilderness at such a young age taught him several things, but the most important part he learned from those days was how to exploit even the slightest opportunity at a disadvantageous position.\nThe moment he knew who his opponent was, Ryan knew he wouldn't be able to win against her through normal means. And the way she began her onslaught, made it obvious that unless he exploited the only ace up his sleeve, he wouldn't be able to win.\nAs such, he went for the win and paralyzed the girl.\nHowever...maybe he underestimated the S-rank warrior a little, and in the end, he was labeled as the loser—just as everyone expected.\n\"Don't make that face, son. You did great.\" The instructor of the third year was present in the infirmary as he saw Ryan getting treated by the nurse.\nOnce the nurse was done patching him up and left, the raven-haired heaved a sigh before saying, \"I disappointed you and my team, sir. I should have done better.\"\nThe lanky instructor shook his head, \"You already did your best. I couldn't have thought of anyone else other than you, pushing Valerie to the verge of defeat.\"\nThose compliments made him feel better, but it would have sounded even better if he had won.\n\"Fuu~okay, since praising you didn't work, let me give you some news to cheer you up.\"\nRyan raised his brows and looked at the older one, \"What news.\"\nThe instructor, with a grin, extended the information he was forbidden to reveal, \"It seems they have selected you for the tournament.\"\nRyan's eyes widened, \"Really?!\"\nThe man pressed his finger against his lips before shaking his head, \"Nothing is one hundred percent but I have heard from the Headmaster about the selection committee's decision.\"\nRyan felt his wounds no longer hurting as much as he looked at the man with his eyes burning a little.\n'I did it, Master...'\n---------**---------\n\"Are you okay, now?\" Austin asked as he helped Valerie sit on the bed.\nThey were also in the infirmary but in a different room.\nValerie was given a medicine that would help her recover. She didn't receive any severe wounds except for the muscle pain in her stomach.\nThe nurse said that she would probably recover by tomorrow.\n\"I feel fine...\" Valerie assured him, \"It doesn't hurt that much.\"\nAustin helped her drink some water, before asking, \"Do you still feel the effect of the Shard?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"No, it disappeared back in the arena. I can move myself fine now.\" To make her believe in him, she even moved her arms in a circular motion.\nSeeing him getting worried for her, was making her both happy and sad.\nHowever, she didn't express her feelings and used her time to assure him as much as she could.\nAfter a bit of pause, Valerie slowly asked, \"Were you...disappointed...seeing me lose?\"\nIt was the first time for her to struggle in a battle after a long time. And in front of Austin, it might be the first time after she awakened her Shard.\nSeeing his pride and confidence in her skills, made her feel that he might be disappointed to see her struggling against someone who was a rank lower than her.\nHowever, \"We all are warriors, Valerie. No one came here to lose, so naturally, everyone would use any means to win this. And under such circumstances, it is natural for even those to fall, whom people believed to be the undefeatable.\"\nCupping her cheeks, he said, \"It's not just about meeting expectations, it's about giving it your all. And today, you showed strong reluctance to lose, and that makes me proud of you.\"\nAustin didn't use flattering words nor did he add anything that he didn't mean.\nIt was a bit shocking to see Valerie fall into a battle since he didn't know Ryan's Shard ability, but that doesn't mean he was disappointed in her.\nYes, if she had just accepted her defeat right there and then after falling, then Austin might have felt dissatisfied with her performance. And as her lover and friend, he would have told her right away.\nValerie lowered her gaze, before uttering, \"I want to confess something...\"\nAustin raised his brows before removing his hands from her face, \"What is it?\" The way she just said that he knew it was something serious.\nValerie bit her lips and hesitated for a moment...however, she knew that if she hid it, she wouldn't be able to look at herself in the mirror.\n\"...just when I was about to slide out of the arena...something stopped me from behind...it was an invisible force and remained just for a moment, which I capitalized and attacked Ryan.\"\nValerie was ashamed of herself for claiming victory when she received help from something unexpected. And the person in front of whom she confessed her sin was the only person whose judgment she could accept.\nAustin heaved a long sigh before he looked at the system screen,\n[Absolute Barrier timer: 28h 37 min]\n...at that time, he subconsciously used the Absolute Barrier to stop Valerie from getting eliminated from the battle.\nHe was torn between the thought of whether to tell her or not when suddenly,\n\"Austin, your match is up.\" Rhea entered the infirmary and informed him.\nAustin exhaled an audible breath before getting up.\nTurning his eyes back to Valerie, he asked, \"Want to come and see me win?\"\nValerie smiled fondly at him before nodding and holding his hand.\nRhea suddenly asked, \"Is it really okay to bring her?\"\nAustin nodded, \"Yeah, it's fine. After all, I can't miss this opportunity to impress my lady.\" Austin had a teasing grin on his face as he squeezed her hand and pulled her closer.\nValerie blushed upon hearing those words, as she looked at him shyly.\n\"...it's a crime to be around you guys....\" Rhea sighed.\n--------**--------\nMorkel was in his office room, currently reading a letter last sent by Aiden.\nRecalling back on his conversation with the First Prince, Morkel felt quite disturbed about something.\n\"You 'need' to remove Austin otherwise, he would never let you become one with Rhea,\" Aiden spoke those words with utmost conviction.\n\"He is just 'pretending to be with Valerie,' but in fact, he is still 'after Rhea'.\"\nThose words just etched in his head, and Morkel became sure that Austin was indeed putting up an act so that he could pursue Rhea in secret.\n\"You think about it yourself...how, out of nowhere, my brother became so close to the girl whom he hated for this long?\"\nAiden gave him a reason not to trust Austin and believe what Aiden was suggesting.\n\"Then what should I do?\" Morkel asked; a bit unsure whether to directly come in the way of the Second Prince.\nAt that moment, Aiden rested his hand on Morkel's shoulder and told him, \"You just need to keep a watch on Austin and report everything about him to me. Once I get the whole idea of what he is up to, it wouldn't be much of a problem to let father know.\"\nMorkel raised a questioning brow at that time, \"And what if...he really is not pretending?\"\nAiden never let go of that smile from his face..but in that moment, that smile looked a little strained, as he repeated, \"'Austin is evil' and 'he will snatch your Rhea if you don't do anything'.\"\nThat was the last conversation Morkel had with Aiden. And after that, the Professor began exchanging letters with him, sharing Austin's activities in the academy. The recent news of Austin being involved with the demons and his constant training with Sebastian and Valerie.\nAnd then the meeting with the Headmaster followed by rescheduling his and Valerie's match to the first day.\nMorkel did as Aiden asked him to...however, in a corner of his mind Morkel always felt that Austin's movements were not towards Rhea. He doesn't even care about what she feels.\nTrue, there was friendship between them; proof was when Austin asked Valerie to help Rhea with her spell activation.\nWhen Austin recently made contact with Morkel, revealing his intention and his knowledge about Aiden's scheme, Morkel felt that he might have missed the mark completely.\n'Which Prince should I trust...' Morkel was in a dilemma; however, considering Austin's growing influence on Rhea, he knew that the boy could manipulate her into believing things that weren't even true.\nAustin is, unexpectedly, good at manipulation.\nThe blond Prince knows something that will make Rhea feel indebted and leave a very strong impression.\n'The more I think about it, the more I feel Austin is a safer option....'\nNow, the question arises: what would he say to Aiden?\n'Hmm...a little misinformation wouldn't hurt....'\n---------**--------\nA/N:- I hope you all liked reading the chapter.

They have already watched some of the exciting battles, and many of the audience have their matches in a few days; that's why more than half of the audience have already vacated the indoor gym.\nWhen Austin entered the resting area, just minutes before his match, he found no one inside.\nIt was already evening and today's event was about to come to an end. So it was not unnatural.\nSitting on the centric bench he exhaled a long breath.\nThis...was a serious battle. Unlike the Knight he faced back in the dungeon, here, Austin couldn't go for the kill nor could he retreat. He just needs to either knock out his opponent or throw them out of the arena.\nAnd for that, he would need to give it his all.\nHe was not going to use his Barrier originally since explaining his sudden awakening would have been a hassle, and now, he doesn't have the option.\nHe could use his WhisperWing and his Shard, and with the help of those two, he was going to win this battle anyhow.\n'Show me my stats ..'

The number of people who got tricked in that instance resulted in a massive boost.]\n\"...\" He got a reward even though his intentions never were to elevate his stats. It wasn't like he would ever reject free points, but it was a little bizarre how some of the stats work.\n'System...if I throw myself down a building, will that increase my endurance stats?'\n[Indeed, host!]\n\"...\" Well, he was not a masochist so he would refrain from utilizing such methods.\n\"Austin, you are up.\" The instructor informed him before the blond Prince removed his eyes from the system screen and got up.\nHe had already done his stretching, so he headed directly towards the arena.\nThe sound of cheering and people muttering completely surrounded him. However, Austin didn't let it overwhelm him; utilizing his experience as a Prince and a rugby player act normal in front of so many eyes.\nOn the other side of the arena stood a short red-haired girl who had a cocky smile on her face.\n'She is a third year .. and unfortunately, I don't know what her Shard could do.'\nHer stance signified nonchalance, exposing how relaxed she was about the battle. Well, at least she wasn't as brutal as the people...\n\"Huh? A D-rank bottom feeder will fight a B-rank?\"\n\"Elara is gonna chew her on the mat!\"\n\"Gotta see some punch bag show.\"\n\"Hey, hey! Didn't he defeat a third year recently....\"\n\"Well, screw that! I just wanna see an absolutely intense battle!\"\nAustin took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He was having some butterfly feeling in his stomach because this was the first official duel he was facing.\n\"Don't need to prepare. I will end this battle sooner than it takes to tie shoe laces.\" Elara spoke; confidence dripping from her tone.\nAustin didn't respond to her and entered into his battle stance.\nHe was already carrying Wisp in his hand and summoned his Shard in the other.\nThe referee stepped forward and asked Elara, \"Participant, ready?\"\nElara summoned a short kunai in her hand that glowed with a greenish hue before she nodded, \"Ready.\"\n'Second-stage....' Considering the details of her Shard, Austin could tell that she was on the second stage of evolution, meaning she could use magic.\n\"Participant, ready?\" The referee asked, and Austin nodded,\n\"Yes.\"\nBringing down his raised hand, the referee announced,\n\"Begin!\"\n*ZWOOSH*\nBoth participants shot forward at once, their form turning blurry just the moment it began.\nHowever, much to Elara's panic, the other one reached her even before she could have crossed half-court\n\"Shit-*clang*!\" She had to bring her Shard downward to parry that attack which was aimed at her stomach.\nShe was pushed back a little despite her momentum, as the girl felt her arms vibrating because of the collision.\nLooking up at him, she said with a strained smile, \"You are strong.\"\nAustin didn't entertain the idea of a conversation amidst battle and charged in once again.\nElara barely had the time to bring her Shard up so she ducked at the incoming Shard—big mistake.\n**CRACK**\nAustin knew she would bend low that's why he lifted his knee and drove it into her face, knocking the girl back.\nElara gritted her teeth, twisting in midair. Just before she hit the ground, she flung a kunai—\n*SHLINK*\nAustin tilted his head, effortlessly dodging it. But that smirk on her face… it set off alarm bells.\n*CLICK*\nAnd then—she vanished.\nHis eyes widened.\n**DHAK**\nA sharp impact smashed into his skull, forcing him forward. His foot barely stopped short of the borderline.\nElara saw her chance. She lunged, aiming to shove Austin off the stage—but he twisted on his feet with beast-like instincts, catching her by the head and aiming to throw her away.\n...but it happened again.\n*Click*\nAustin's fingers clenched nothing but air as Elara reappeared, standing safely in the middle of the arena, her smirk as sharp as a blade.\n\"Now that you've seen what my Shard can do… wanna give up?\" she teased, tilting her head.\nAustin's eyes darkened. Without hesitation, he commanded Wisp to strike from behind.\nBut—\n*SHLINK*\nWisp cut through nothing. Elara had already disappeared, leaving only her Shard floating in her place.\n\"Tch.\" Austin clicked his tongue and hurled his Shard behind him on instinct.\nBad move.\n**DHAK**\nA brutal kick slammed into his ribs from the side. He barely flinched before—\n*Click*\nShe was gone again.\nAustin staggered, but his instincts roared—he spun, scanning for her.\nToo late.\n**DHAK**\nA knee crashed into his back, forcing him forward.\n*Click*\nShe vanished again.\n**THWACK**\nA kick hammered his jaw from below, snapping his head back.\n*Click*\nGone.\nAustin barely steadied himself before—\n**CRACK**\nAn elbow smashed into his ribs, knocking the air from his lungs. He coughed, but before he could recover—\n**DHAK! CRACK! DHAK**\nBlow after blow, Elara rained down attacks, appearing and disappearing like a ghost. His body jerked with every hit—his shoulders, his stomach, his legs—each strike carrying raw, ruthless force.\nAustin's vision blurred. His stance wavered.\n\"Phahahah! She is brutaaaaaaal!\"\n\"Damn, bro, she violated him.\"\n\"Man, I can never be him.\"\n\"Seriously, putting a D-rank against a B-rank? Was the headmaster wanting to enjoy some punchbag session?\"\nValerie couldn't think of hearing anything at the moment as she stared at the arena with her hands clasped.\nSeeing her Lord getting hurt before her eyes yet not being able to do anything was the worst feeling.\nHer heart trembled and her Soul Energy was barely within restraints...as she continuously kept looking at him....\n'I know you can do it...please...'\nBack in the arena, Elara reappeared—this time for longer than a flicker. With a playful grin, she draped an arm over Austin's shoulder.\n\"Told ya to retreat. It's impossible to keep track of slippery beauty like me.\"\nAustin didn't respond. His head hung low, shoulders still, but his hand slowly rose—gripping the edge of her hood.\nElara sighed. \"So you're still trying to—\"\nThe moment he pulled, she disappeared.\n*Click*\nShe reappeared behind him, eyes narrowing. Now was the time.\nHer fist cocked back, aiming straight for the back of his neck. One clean hit and it was over.\n'You were a great punching bag, but now it's over—'\n**GHAK**\nA dull, sickening crack.\nElara's world twisted as Austin's elbow slammed into her gut. Air fled her lungs. A sharp, numbing pain tore through her stomach.\nShe staggered. Her knees buckled.\nClutching her stomach, she gasped, barely forcing herself upright. \"How did you—?!\"\nBut Austin was already moving. He spun, foot rising—\n*Click*\nElara vanished again, but this time, she wasn't as quick.\nA single heartbeat later—\n**BOOOOM**\nA sharp, agonized scream tore from her throat.\nShe hadn't even fully materialized before Austin's fist crashed into her stomach—again, in the exact same spot.\nHer body jerked violently. Blood rushed to her head. Her vision swayed.\nAustin's face remained cold, detached, as his hand shot up—fingers reaching for her throat.\n*Click*\nNo. She refused to let him.\nShe flickered away, appearing farther this time, her breaths ragged.\n\"How the hell are you tracking me?!\"\nAustin didn't answer. He simply turned, summoning his Shard.\nElara clenched her teeth. Her body screamed in protest, but she forced herself to steady. If she just—\nA blur.\nAustin was already on her, dagger flashing as he aimed for her shoulder—\n*Click*\nGone.\nA shuriken whirled through the space where she had been.\nAustin halted, his stance relaxed, but his gaze was sharp.\nAnd then—\nElara reappeared.\nRight where she had vanished.\nA mistake.\nWith a vicious expression she cried, \"Got y—\" however,\n**DHAK**\nHer pupils shrank. A shudder ran through her body.\nThe third strike—right into her stomach. The exact same spot.\nHer body gave out. Eyes wide, mouth slightly open, she crumpled to the ground.\nThe arena fell silent.\nShe had speed. She had skill.\nBut against sheer, calculated brutality—she didn't stand a chance.\nThe referee came forward to check on Elara before he declared, \"Austin wins!\"\n*Clap* *Clap*\nThere was only a single person clapping in the audience since the rest of the crowd was too stunned in disbelief to react.\nAustin finally gave a reaction.\nLooking at the crying Valerie who was clapping for him to congratulate him, he couldn't stop himself from smiling.\n------------**-------------\nA/N:- Physically, Austin was stronger than her because of his leveling up. But her Shard was a difficult part to handle.\nI wrote the fight scene a little fast-paced. How was it?\n(If I get 10 comments on this chap, I might upload another today).",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Chapter 83- The perfect plan?\nIn the bedroom of the King, there were a few people present, currently involved in a serious discussion.\nThey received a letter, formal, from Hener. They have extended a helping hand to Eryndor.\nWhen that news was shared, everyone, including the King was elated and relieved. After all, the current situation with Drenovar had them on the edges of their seats.\nHowever, the moment the Prime Minister read the thing they wanted in exchange, the atmosphere of the room dropped.\nEvery smile dropped and a frown marred their faces.\n\"Exile the Prince huh...they are not even trying to hide their intentions.\" Arthur (the Prime Minister) scoffed as he folded the parchment.\nThey want to detach Austin from the kingdom so they can hunt him down to take revenge for what has happened.\nParkinson kidnapped Austin and beat him so severely. He tried to kill the royal Highness, and after being caught, he sought revenge. How insane some people can be?\n\"We are not taking their help.\" Cedric, who seemed extremely pale, and was lying down on the bed, voiced his decision.\nIf not for his current state, his face would have been red in anger. First, that bastard heir of Hener harmed his son, and now the King of Hener was using such underhanded tactics to fulfill what Parkinson wanted.\nThe ministers in the room glanced at each other, and that made Arthur really surprised.\n'Are they really thinking too...God.'\nTurning towards the ministers, the Prime Minister spoke up, \"You all are not agreeing with him rather seem hesitant? Do you really want to sacrifice the Prince to get their help?\"\nCedric frowned, as he looked at the council in silence.\nIt was the chief advisor who became the mouth of others' minds, as he said, \"The situation with Drenovar is quite severe. If we don't do anything, within a month, they will surely send their main forces to take down Eryndor.\"\nThe Finance Minister added, \"If you realistically think then thousands of lives are on the line.\"\nArthur's brows elevated—so they mean to say, to save thousands of lives they need to sacrifice one.\n\"And what are the chances that we would win even after taking Hener's help? Or who will be responsible if Hener, in the name of help, stabs us in the back when the time comes? Will you take responsibility, Sir Orwold?\" Arthur asked with clear displeasure in his voice.\nOrwold Sigmund, the Finance Minister, frowned upon hearing that, as he said, \"I am not talking about taking risks or anything about that. It's the job of the Chief Advisor to evaluate the risk in a trade. I just extended the facts in the matte-\"\n\"We are not accepting this offer.\" Cutting off the man, the Supreme Authority spoke.\nCedric's brows were drawn closer, and clearly, disappointment and anger could be sensed from his demeanor.\nLooking at the people who were ready to trade his son's life for those bastard's support, he said, \"We are, in any condition, not going to accept the proposal if it threatens Austin's life. And that's my final decision.\"\nSilence descended in the room after that. None had the authority to go against the command of the Supreme Authority.\nAmidst the growing silence, suddenly, the one who hadn't uttered a word until now, spoke, \"I have a suggestion, Your Majesty.\"\nEvery eye turned towards the silver-haired Prince, who seemed unnaturally hesitant and a bit fearful.\nCedric wordlessly ushered him to continue.\n\"There is a way by which we won't be sacrificing Austin's safety and will get Hener's support as well.\"\nA few gasped, while a few eyes grew narrow in anticipation. Was there really a way?\nArthur somehow had a bad feeling about this…but he didn't interrupt the young man.\n\"Go on.\" Cedric gave the permission.\nAiden stepped forward, and voiced his idea, \"We can stage Austin's exile, making it appear genuine while secretly surrounding him with security. When they attempt to attack him, we'll retaliate and orchestrate his disappearance. Since they'll never admit to targeting Austin, we won't need to explain why he was protected. For the duration of the war, Austin can simply stay hidden from the world's eyes.\"\nThe eyes of the council members brightened up hearing that brilliant suggestion.\nEven Arthur was surprised that the First Prince came up with such a detailed and deliberate plan in such a short time.\n\"If we follow the plan and everything goes accordingly then surely, Eryndor and the Second Prince will survive.\" The Chief Advisor beamed with excitement.\n\"Indeed. We can send some of our best troops to protect him. And Austin himself is a skillful warrior.\" The Captain of the Imperial Legion showed his consent.\nEvery head was nodding in assent since this was the perfect plan Eryndor needed right now.\nAs a king, Cedric should also respond positively. This was, indeed, a good strategy to fool the fools and take advantage of them…\n…however, as a father, his heart was restless.\nWhile every eye was turned towards the King, seeking his response, Cedric lowered his eyes, and said, \"Give me some time to think.\"\n\"Oh, yes. Then we will excuse ourselves.\" Aiden instantly responded as he stepped back.\nIf not for so many eyes around him, the First Prince wouldn't have suppressed the big smirk.\n'This is so perfect.'\n--------**---------\nBack in the academy, Austin was sitting in the infirmary with three people surrounding him.\nThe nurse has already patched his wounds, and given him painkillers. He wasn't much injured, well compared to the battle with the knight, this much was nothing.\n\"You were majestic, Austin. I couldn't remove my eyes from you, the entire time.\"\nValerie frowned when Rudolph said that. She wanted to say that!\n\"Yeah, I was stunned to see you judging her moves so accurately,\" Rhea added, making Valerie pout. When can she praise him?!\nAustin chuckled as he looked at the slight bulge on his fiancée's cheek before he said, \"And you, Val? Did I impress you?\"\nThe other two also turned towards the girl, and the sudden shift of attention made her slightly flustered. However, when it comes to praising her Lord, she never backs down,\n\"I absolutely love you!\" She praised him…wait!\nThat's not what she wanted to say! She wanted to say that she absolutely loved his battle!\nRudolph chuckled while Rhea shook her head with a smile, seeing the ever-stoic girl turning red so furiously.\nAustin lovingly smiled, as he held her and said, \"I also love you, Val.\"\n\"Fuee~\" She might also need a bed in the infirmary….\n—-------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. And trust me, Valerie really wanted to say that she loved how he fought ;)",

      "content": "Chapter 85: Chapter 84- Reward\nAustin was allowed to return to his room since his injuries weren't too severe.\nSince it was already dark, and would be difficult to travel, Austin decided to start their journey tomorrow, early in the morning.\nHe had already prepared his plan; the first place he would be visiting after leaving the academy was the great forest. He needs the mythical extract that could cure any illness or injury instantly. That is the key to cool down the tension between Eryndor and Drenovar.\nAfter that, Austin was planning to pay Lord Corwon a visit since the Dukedom was not far from the Great Forest. He needs to assure the man that there is no need for him to worry about his daughter.\nWell, that wasn't much of a problematic task, since Austin knows how much Lord Corwon loves his daughter. So convincing him would be easy.\nAnd the final destination of the Prince would be the Capital, to meet his sick father, and assure him about a few things.\nAll the travel time is taken into consideration, along with some delays because of unforeseen situations, it would take around twelve days for them to finish their business in the Capital. After that only three days would be left....and that is not enough to settle the situation with Drenovar.\nThe problem was—every participant had to attend the gathering arranged by the council on the occasion of the commencement of the tournament.\nThat's why asking the Headmaster to extend a few days so Austin could finish his job would be pointless. The Headmaster would be helpless in this situation.\n\"Are you worried?\"\nHearing the sweet voice of his girlfriend brought Austin back to reality as he glanced at that bright pair of eyes.\nSeriously, sometimes he couldn't believe that this beauty was his fiancée.\n\"Yeah, kind of. But I know we will do something about it.\" Austin was short on time, but having a powerful warrior like Valerie and an experienced strategist like Sebastian by his side would surely allow him to tread through all the difficulties.\nAnd there was his system too.\nValerie turned to stand before him, their hands connected as she spoke in a warm tone, \"Don't take all the burden on yourself. I know what's at stake, but nothing matters more than your health.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh; for her, his health was more important than the country. Yeah, he loves this girl.\nSoon, a teasing grin extended his lips as he said, \"Talking about my health, I know a perfect medicine to help me recover.\"\nValerie blinked in confusion, \"What is...uh!\" She recalled...the reward!\nShe promised him that if he wins the qualifiers...she...she would...k-k-kiss...\nThe red-faced Valerie was adorable, and those teary eyes almost made him let go of her hand and stop teasing her. However, he has won this reward, so not even her tears would stop him.\n\"Val, I am gonna kiss you.\" He announced, before leaning closer to her.\nValerie didn't move back or show any sign of reluctance. She was just nervous to death, but never felt aversion. How could she? Her mind, body, and soul already belong to him.\nBut still, she couldn't stop herself from shaking in nervousness as she closed her eyes.\nThey were at the backside of the school, which leads to the girl's dorm. Although there wasn't anyone around, Austin still pulled Valerie under the stairs and gently pressed her against the wall.\n\"I won't be able to look at your eyes like that...are you that nervous?\" He whispered, his hot breath making her heart rate accelerate.\nHer delicate lashes fluttered as she opened her eyes and looked at him. She could not tell how nervous she was being so close to the one she had always yearned for.\nHis sharp features, alluring gaze, and body warmth made her heart and body melt. If not for him to be holding her, she might have dropped to the ground.\n\"If you don't want to...you can push me-\" Austin was silenced when suddenly she pressed her lips against his.\nAlthough it was clumsy, it showed that she wasn't reluctant.\nNo further questions needed to be asked.\nHis arm coiled around her slender waist, the other one pushing her chin up, he brought his lips to meet her.\n*Squeeze*\nValerie clutched his shirt, as she felt her lips being captured by a familiar warmth. The world around them faded, leaving only the heat of their embrace.\nHis lips moved with both tenderness and urgency, molding against hers as if savoring every second. A quiet sigh escaped her as she melted into him, their breaths mingling, hearts pounding in unison.\nThe kiss deepened, slow yet intense, each movement speaking volumes more than words ever could.\nTheir lips parted for a moment; aquamarine met violet before their lips reunited.\nThe heat of their bodies became one, as Austin ran his finger down her back, his touch feeling hot like embers, as Valerie moaned in his mouth.\nThis sensation was new to her, yet she didn't dislike it. It made her feel tingly all over. Being touched at places which none has touched her before. Allowing her Lord to leave his traces all over her....that's the greatest joy of her life.\nTheir kiss continued for a few minutes before Austin finally felt a little bit satisfied, and parted from her.\nPressing his forehead against her, he breathed a little roughly,\n\"I thought only an intense battle could make my heart race this much. Guess, I was severely wrong.\" Austin whispered as he felt his heart drumming against his chest.\nValerie clung to him, resting her face against his chest, listening to his heartbeat, \"My situation...is the same.\"\nAustin wrapped his hand around her back, before whispering, \"Each moment with you makes me fall even deeper for you. I think I might get obsessed with you, Val.\"\nThe violet-haired smiled, \"I'd love that.\"\nThe couple remained in each other's embrace for some more time, reluctant to break the blissful moment, but every good thing has to come to an end.\n\"I will see you tomorrow in the morning.\" Austin kissed the back of her hand, as he bid his farewell.\nValerie smiled fondly at her Lord, \"I will be there. Goodnight.\"\nAlthough she said that, she didn't pull her hand away, nor did she show any sign of wanting to leave.\nHowever, suddenly, a voice interrupted the sweet atmosphere between them,\n\"Young master,\" It was Sebastian, who looked unusually worried, as he approached the duo.\n\"Sebas?\" Austin asked, \"What happened?\"\nSebastian extended a letter toward his Lord, before saying, \"It was sent through WarpMail,\"\nAustin's eyes narrowed; WarpMail was only used for emergency situations since the teleportation costs too much.\nHe took the letter which had no name of the sender but just the emblem of Eryndor.\n'Father....'\n---------**--------\nA/N:- I hope you liked the chapter.

      "content": "Chapter 86: Chapter 85- Change in plans\n[Meet me as soon as you can.\n—Father.]\nThere were only seven words in the letter sent to Austin. For these seven words, he sent the mail through teleportation.\nNaturally, being called by the King of the nation on such an urgent basis would make anyone panic. However, the first thing Valerie uttered after reading the letter was,\n\"It might be sent by someone else.\" She held conviction in her voice. The only reason she refrained from calling the name of the person was because Austin had told her not to speak about Aiden in front of Sebastian.\n\"Why do you say so, young lady?\" Sebastian asked.\nThe trio sat in Austin's office, where they were discussing the letter.\n\"I mean, what would he need from Austin all of a sudden? In my opinion, it's a trap.\" Valerie looked certain.\nHowever, \"The handwriting is his, Val.\" Austin knows it since Cedric was the only one who helped Austin improve his handwriting in the past. The data organization or other related work Austin received regularly was sent by his father, too.\nAustin took out the previous requests sent from the capital before showing them to Valerie, \"Here, see this. It's Father who sent this data sheet.\"\nValerie, with her brows drawn closer, inspected the two parchments, and surely, the strokes of the letters and the peculiar way of writing 'Y' and a few other letters were the same.\nSebastian was shocked, as he asked, \"You knew that it was your Father who used to send the work?\"\nAustin nodded, \"And I also know that he always checks my work by himself too.\"\nSebastian felt a sense of relief spreading in his chest, upon hearing that. At least, the young master wouldn't think that his father had completely neglected him.\nHowever, this wasn't the time to feel happy. The grey-haired butler suggested, \"I think we should visit for the Capital, sir.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"And how can you be so sure that Father wasn't threatened to write this letter?\"\nValerie also turned to look at the oldest one, with a questioning look on her face.\nWithout thinking even for a moment, the man responded, \"Threatening the King means my brother is dead. And if he dies, I would have instantly known.\"\nAustin was taken aback by that statement. He knew that Sebastian's younger brother was currently serving the king, but…how could his death be known by the man?\nAustin decided to worry about that later, \"Since you seem so certain about it, I will trust your words.\" Austin spoke before standing up.\nTaking the letter from Valerie he helped the lady to get up before telling her, \"Val, we need to leave. Go and pack your bag, and meet me at the back side gate in half an hour.\"\nValerie's heart was restless, but her experience didn't allow her to waste another moment before she nodded and walked out of the room.\nAustin turned towards the butler before uttering, \"I want you to write a letter to the headmaster, which he should receive tomorrow morning, so no one knows that we left tonight.\"\n\"Understood, sir.\"\nAustin walked out of the office, leaving Sebastian behind before making his way to his room.\nSomething major must have happened for Cedric to suddenly call him back home.\nDid he discover the culprit behind his deteriorating health? Or maybe he was making some aggressive decision against Drenovar?\n'I hope none of the two to be the case since Aiden would manipulate both situations for his benefit.'\nNow, he could only hope that until he reaches Eryndor, his father remains alive and doesn't take any violent steps that could lead to Eryndor's demise.\nReaching his room, he took his traveling bag and stuffed a few clothes, while the other necessary things were dumped inside his Inventory.\n'I just hope that the bastard doesn't end up ruining everything beyond repair.'\n—--------**-----------\nAs planned, everyone gathered at the back gate of the academy while wearing a cloak to hide themselves from unnecessary attention.\n\"Young master, I have already arranged three horses at the back. We should leave now.\" Sebastian spoke as he took the bag of his master.\nAustin nodded before he took the bag from Valerie and told her, \"Wait here,\" Saying so, he jumped over the wall, and landed on the wet soil.\nThe temperature was quite low and the dew had moistened the soil.\nHe looked around to find any teacher patrolling the perimeter, but thankfully, there were none.\nHe didn't pick up any presence so he called out, \"Come.\"\nValerie and Sebastian jumped over the wall, landing in silence before they headed towards the horses.\n\"Where did you get them from?\" Valerie asked, seeing the one-horned horses grazing nearby.\n\"I have a few connections with the people inside and outside of the academy.\" Sebastia responded before he turned towards his Lord and asked, \"Young Master, are we taking any break?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"No, right straight to Capital. Even if we get separated, don't stop. If it's an emergency light the torch. If not, just reach the Capital by tomorrow evening.\"\nThe other two nodded in understanding.\nAustin helped Valerie to climb the horse before he climbed as well.\n\"Okay then, let's go.\"\n—-------**----------\nFar away, the land situated by the water could be seen currently illuminated by several night lights.\nTowering palaces of polished stone and intricate carvings rise above the city, their golden domes gleaming under the moon.\nWide streets, paved with smooth tiles, are lined with grand buildings, bustling markets, and fountains flowing with clear water.\nThe golden palace of Drenovar stood proudly in the heart of the capital. Its bronze gates open to a courtyard with flowing fountains and lush gardens. Inside, tall pillars with intricate carvings support vast halls lined with silk banners.\nInside the palace, there were several guards lined up in the gallery as a certain man walked hastily.\nPanic was written over his face as the black-haired man finally reached his destination and pushed open the door.\n\"So as-.\" The person to whom the office belonged paused mid-sentence as he turned to look at the man who suddenly entered.\n\"Gentlemen, let's talk after a small break.\" The red-haired individual spoke before the two guests walked out of the room.\nThe black-haired stepped forward and uttered, \"Brother, grandfather's situation has worsened. He fainted just half an hour ago. And this was the third time today already.\"\nThe first Prince of Drenovar, Hazir, sighed, upon hearing his younger brother's words. Their grandfather has been sick for some time now and they couldn't find any cure to his illness.\n\"What did the soothsayer say?\"\nThe younger one, with his face darkened, added, \"The same thing; the savior is about to arrive.\"\nHazir shook his head, \"Nothing will happen unless we do something.\" The soothsayer has been repeating the same thing for like ever now; however, until now, they haven't received anything from anyone regarding the illness.\nSince they couldn't let the world know about the Pillar of Drenovar falling, they only asked for help from close allies. However, none of them had any clue of the illness he was suffering from.\n\"Then what should we do, brother?\" The younger brother, Tavrin asked.\nHazir heaved a sigh before telling him, \"I think we need to discuss the plan of invasion.\"\nTavrin frowned, \"But the troops are prepared…everything has already been planned.\"\nHazir nodded, \"I know but we need to use our resources in finding the cure first.\"\nThe younger one lowered his head, \"As you say, brother.\"\nUnbeknownst to Austin, Eryndor was saved from its possible demise by this decision.\n—-------**----------\nA/N:- I think I will draw a map of the world and post it on Discord.

Philius smiled warmly as he remembered how the councilmen wrote Austin's name even before the battle concluded.\nReason? They were really impressed by the tactics Austin used to track Elara.\nWhile others might not have perceived it, the sharp eyes of the council member named Curt clearly noticed Austin putting his Shard in the hood of his opponent.\nAnd tracking one's Shard is way easier than tracking a person.\nAustin kept a firm control over his Shard since traveling through space, even for a split second, could force one to retreat their soul component.\nAnd on top of that, Austin even summoned another piece of Shroud, and that was absolutely astounding.\n'One cannot show such great command over their Shard unless they have at least evolved to the Second stage ...' And here, Austin hasn't gone through a single evolution.\nThat discovery got the interest of the two Council members that's why it was highly likely that they would call Austin for some questioning. Or if they don't, they surely would keep a close eye on the anomalous student.\n*Click*\nOpening the door of his office, Philius stepped inside before closing the door behind his back.\nHeading towards his desk, he sat down and was about to start organizing his data sheet, when suddenly he found a letter resting on the table.\n\"Hmm?\" Philius's brows raised; this letter surely wasn't here yesterday.\nHe looked around and found the security parameters were at their place, and the trap set under his chair was also armed.\n'Someone quite familiar with my office, and possessing quite an experience....' Philius slowly lifted the letter and assessed it for any trap.\nHowever, he found nothing suspicious, so he tore the small seal and took out the letter.\nThe moment his eyes landed on the sender, Philius heaved a sigh,\n\"Surely, for you infiltrating my office should be nothing, Sebastian.\"\n----------**----------\nThey have been traveling continuously since last night,\nSebastian purposely chose the mutated horses, since they could travel for three days without needing to rest.\nThrough towns and forests, their journey continued. Austin was thankful that his beloved wasn't a fragile woman. At any moment, he glanced at Valerie he found her unfazed by the tiresome journey.\n....however, mentally, he wasn't that used to riding a horse for this long that's why Austin was feeling quite dull in his back and wanted to take some rest.\nHowever, he couldn't stop the journey, considering he needed to reach the capital as soon as he could.\nUnder such a situation, 'System, open dungeon for me.'\n[Ding!]\n[Does the host want to exchange 300 points to summon an instant dungeon?]\n[Y/N]\n'Yes.'\n[Command accepted.]\n[Assessing the host's stats...]\n[Generating dungeon...]\n[Ding!]\n[Dungeon Name: Colossus Abyss]\n[Level: B]\n[Time Limit: 10 hours]\n[Reward: ???]\nAustin heaved a sigh as the world came to a pause before him and a few meters ahead of him was the shining door.\nAustin dismounted the horse and walked towards the dungeon.\n*ZIIIP*\nAfter a moment of hypermotion, Austin was standing in a completely different world.\nThe dungeon was an endless expanse of frozen lava; its surface cracked and uneven, stretching as far as the eye could see. Jagged rock formations, once molten, now stand like twisted monuments of a forgotten era.\nThe air is cold and still, yet the ground holds a lingering warmth as if the fire beneath never fully died.\nAustin narrowed his eyes as he saw the seven-foot-tall giants standing in groups, waiting for him.\nOn their heads, [5] was floating, which signified each giant would grant him five points.\n'They look sturdy....' The blackened skin and tight muscles of the giants seemed quite tough to break using his Shard. And not to talk about that number could easily overwhelm him if he allows himself to get surrounded.\n'How many points do I need to retreat?' Austin asked as he began stratching his sore limbs.\n[Ding!]\n[Hundred points, host.]\nThat means he has to defeat twenty of those giants to return, eh?\nAustin glanced at the timer, and there were seven minutes left before the preparation space would disappear and he would be sent to fight.\nAustin was running his eyes around, making a plan on how he could defeat the giants without breaking something, when suddenly,\n[Ding!]\n[An exciting offer has arrived!]\n[The host can purchase an A-rank weapon at a lower price:]\n[Name: Raijin Wrath]\n[Rank: A]\n[Attribute: Lightning]\n[Price: 1800 pts-> 200 pts]\n[Buy?]\n[Y/N]\n....\nReading the description, Austin couldn't help but utter, \"You are straying away from being a system, and becoming more like a salesman.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Command accepted! The flash sale would be disposed of-]\n\"Okay, I accept. Geez, you have quite the temper.\" Austin heaved a weary sigh, as he found an illumination before his hand.\nHe extended his hand and held the weapon materializing before his eyes.\nHe only has about seventy points left, which he could use to upgrade his stats. After defeating the dungeon boss, he hopes he can get enough points to summon the next dungeon and unlock the shop.\nThe battle axe looked majestic with a gleaming white handle, smooth as polished ivory yet unyielding as steel. Its double-edged blade, forged from sky metal, shimmers with a faint blue glow, crackling with caged lightning.\nAustin swung it casually, and the spark flew here and there, showing how useful it would be against the giant monsters.\nLooking at the time, he took a deep breath,\n[4....3....2...1...*BIZ*]\n\"It's time to grind.\"\n----------**----------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 88: Chapter 87- Back home\nThunder roared, lightning tore through the sky, and the earth trembled beneath the sheer force of Austin's magic. His axe gleamed above his head, gripped tightly in both hands as he locked onto the next giant.\n**SQUELCH**\nThe blade tore through thick, unyielding flesh, splitting the monster's skull clean in two. Dark blood gushed as the towering beast crumpled to the ground with a heavy thud.\n\"Huff... Huff...\" Austin's breaths came ragged as he watched the blackened pool spread beneath the fallen giant. His own blood dripped from a cut on his forehead, and sweat made his grip on the axe slick, but there was no time to rest.\n**THUMP THUMP**\nThe ground trembled under the relentless march of more giants, their massive frames looming like moving mountains. There was no hiding from them. No escape.\nAustin tightened his grip, his stance firm as he lifted the axe with one hand. He locked eyes with the next beast—a hulking, ten-foot brute with unnaturally long arms stretching toward him, eager to crush his skull.\nBut before its fingers could close around him—\nHe vanished.\nThe giant's grasp closed on nothing but air.\n*SPLURT*\nA deep, gaping wound appeared across the monster's stomach. Austin had already passed it, his axe dripping with fresh blood.\n\"They're too slow…\" he muttered, barely sparing it at a glance.\nThe beast howled in pain, twisting with rage. It swung its enormous arm, aiming to obliterate him in a single blow.\nAustin leaped away, just in time.\n**BOOOOOM**\nThe force of the strike shattered the rocky ground where he had just stood. A second slower, and his head would've been nothing but pulp.\n'...they are monstrously strong.' Austin wasted no time. The moment the giant's arm crashed into the ground, he lunged forward. His axe, slick with blood, became an extension of his body as he swung—\n*SLASH*\nThe beast's knee split open, black blood gushing as it let out a guttural roar. Before it could stumble, Austin twisted his body and drove his axe upward—\n**CRACK**\nThe blade buried deep into the monster's ribcage. He yanked it free just as another giant came crashing in from the side, its massive fist descending like a hammer.\nAustin kicked off the wounded giant's body, flipping backward as the ground where he stood exploded into dust and rubble.\nBefore his feet could even touch the ground and he could finish the giant—\n*WHAM*\nAnother giant swiped at him in mid-air.\nAustin twisted, barely avoiding the blow as the wind pressure sent him hurtling sideways. He landed hard, rolling across the battlefield before digging his axe into the dirt to stop himself.\nHe looked up. Three more giants were already charging.\nA grin tugged at his lips.\n\"Come on, then.\"\nHe twisted the axe over his head, the lightning charging up, before he swung the axe in an upper arc, sending streams of lightning toward the group.\n**JOLT**\nThe lightning struck the giants, slowing them down but not completely stopping them.\nAustin clicked his tongue, before he lunged forward, his form becoming a blur as he heard towards the three, intending to behead them.\nWhen suddenly,\n**BOOOOM**\n\"Khuk!\" A loud reverberation arrived from the left, sending an airborne Austin flying away.\n*Dhak*\nAustin landed on the ground, rolling away because of the force.\n\"Shit....this is madness...\" He couldn't believe the strength behind that clap was so intense that a sixty-kilogram man was hurtled away.\nAustin slowly opened his eyes, as he saw more than seven giants approaching him.\nHe looked at the current points and found he was still five points short.\n\"Can't give up now...\" Austin pushed himself off the ground...but then, he felt dizzy. He has lost quite some blood and he has been hit a few times by those shockwaves.\nThe giants were closing in—seven of them now, their towering frames blocking the storm-lit sky.\nHe didn't have time to fight them all head-on.\nHis fingers curled into fists as he focused. The storm above rumbled in response. Lightning crackled along his arms, coursing through his veins, rekindling his body with raw energy. He exhaled sharply.\nThen—he moved.\n*CRACK*\nA blinding bolt struck the ground behind him as Austin shot forward like a streak of light. Instead of heading for his axe, he dashed toward the giants, weaving between their massive legs before skidding to a stop.\n\"Over here, you ugly bastards!\"\nRaising both hands, he slammed his palms together.\n**KZAAAAAAP**\nA surge of lightning exploded outward, arcing between the three closest giants, stunning them in place. Their enormous bodies convulsed under the electric shock, their limbs locking up for a crucial second.\nThose three who were struck, stumbled back and set the others, off balance.\nThat was all he needed.\nWithout hesitation, Austin twisted mid-step and launched himself toward the injured giant—the one with the deep gash in its stomach. It had barely recovered, still hunched over, its breathing ragged.\nPerfect.\nAustin vanished in a blur of speed, reappearing just above the giant's hunched form.\nHis form was blended in the dark night, his Shard appeared in his hand, and his eyes held nothing but immense blood lust.\n\"**KHRUAAANGH**\"\nThe giant tried to swat Austin away. However, Austin summoned his Axe and plunged into the arm of the giant, sending a thunderbolt down its arm.\n\"*KHRUUOG*\" The giant, howled, however, Austin gave the beast another reason to cry,\n**SQUELCH**\nAustin dug his Shard deep inside the wound, extending the blade to pierce it through the giant's back.\n**THUMP** **THUMP**\nAll the giants were rushing toward him, faster than before.\n\"RETREAT!\" Austin barked, just as he felt the giant's movement coming to a stop.\n**BLINK**\nAn illumination engulfed him, and before the giant could have captured him, Austin disappeared.\n°°°°°°\n*Thud*\nValerie and Sebastian instantly stopped their horses and jumped toward Austin as they saw the blond Prince falling to the ground.\n\"Austin!\"\n\"Young master!\"\nThey both panicked as they reached the boy who was breathing heavily and looked pale.\nValerie couldn't discern what happened so suddenly when she saw her Lord being all fine just a moment ago.\nAustin looked at the two, as he whispered, \"I might have pushed myself a little there ...sorry,\"\n\"No, young master, we can understand,\" Sebastian spoke. His young master wasn't much used to long journeys since, in the past, he mostly traveled in carriages.\n\"You went through a battle and got injured, so it's understandable,\" Valerie added, a frown of concern on her face.\nLooking at the butler, she said, \"I will ride with him\" She would have suggested staying a little longer so he could get rest, but remembering the urgency of the matter, the only comfort she could provide was to ride the horse with him.\n\"Yes, that would be the best option.\" Sebastian nodded before he lifted Austin from the ground and headed toward Valerie's horse.\nValerie took out a thin and long shawl from her bag before she climbed the horse and wrapped it around herself and Austin—binding them strongly together.\nAustin's face was resting against her bosom, the scent of her hair wash and her natural scent made him feel calm.\nHe glanced up and found the girl looking down at him before she whispered, \"Sleep peacefully, my Lord. I will keep you safe.\"\nShe took his breath away.\n\"...okay.\" Closing his eyes, he fell asleep.\n----------**---------\nThe next time Austin opened his eyes, it was already afternoon.\nHe looked up and found Valerie still riding the horse without an ounce of fatigue on her face even though he had his weight on her.\n\"Val, I am awake now,\" Austin called out, but,\n\"I think you should remain hidden, my lord,\" Valerie responded, and that made him frown.\nAustin looked around and found they were going through familiar streets, \"Why are we going in through the back side?\"\nThis was, undoubtedly, the backside of the capital. Austin has traveled through this path, especially after he awakened his Shard. He usually used this route to go hunting.\n\"The front side is heavily guarded, soldiers are everywhere, that's why Sebastian suggested using this route.\"\nAustin nodded, \"He is-\" he paused when suddenly he felt Valerie shivering.\nLooking up, he found the girl blushing, as she said, \"P-Please don't move your face...i-it distracts me....\"\nAustin took a strong gulp as he realized where his face was resting, \"...sorry, I won't.\"\nAs such, for the rest of the journey, Austin and Valerie traveled in silence.\nAfter moving for another ten minutes, they finally reached the backside of the palace.\nAustin, with Valarie's help, untied himself from his fiancée. Sitting face to face with her, he uttered, \"Thank you for carrying me.\"\nValerie smilingly shook her head, \"Nothing to thank me. As your partner, it's natural for me to take care of you.\"\nThe duo looked into each other's eyes, the glimmer of fondness they both shared.\n\"Young lord, we should get going.\"\nHearing Sebastian's words, Austin heaved a sigh, before jumping off the horse.\nIt's time to discover what in the seven world is happening in Eryndor.\n---------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 89: Chapter 88- The caring older brother\nAiden was in his office, currently talking to his mother, \"I am here with him. I won't let anything disturb his health anymore.\"\nWhile holding her hand in his, Aiden spoke with utmost surety to comfort the lady.\nSophie exhaled a sigh that made her look older than usual before she uttered, \"I don't know what I would have done without you. Your presence has assured your father and me that nothing wrong would happen even when your father is not well.\"\nSophie was initially quite worried when Aiden returned to them back that day. Growing up all alone she thought he would blame them, that he would never accept them as his parents.\nThat's why she started paying more and more attention to him so that their family would never break apart.\nAs a mother, it was her duty to make up for that time when Aiden was away from the family, and struggling with his life.\nAlthough her second son seemed unhappy about how his elder brother was getting all her attention, she thought Austin would understand with time. However, she was disappointed to see how, day after day, Austin only continued to grow wary of Aiden. And soon, his whole personality changed.\nOnce a tender and lovely boy he was. And now, she couldn't even remember when was the last time she had a proper talk with Austin where they didn't end up arguing over something.\n\"You are thinking about, Austin, right?\" Aiden suddenly asked his eyes radiating warmth that made her shoulders slump.\n\"I feel...troubled about him, all the time, Aiden. Even though he has a responsible partner by his side, if Austin continues to possess that attitude, it won't be long before Valerie becomes tired of him.\"\nAiden shook his head, \"You are wrong, Mother; Valerie would never leave him...and somehow, her tolerance is fueling his ego, in my opinion.\"\nSophie, with a frown, nodded, \"Yes...even though I have heard that their relationship has improved recently, it's highly unlikely for that boy to completely turn into a new leaf so suddenly.\"\nSophie very much detests those people who can't respect those who care about them. The only reason why she had an argument last time with Austin was because, despite Aiden's goodwill towards him, Austin always ended up conveying it in the wrong way.\nWhile Aiden always tried to make a good connection with his brother, Austin was not ready to accept him at all.\nBecause of that, Sophie became extremely displeased with his behavior, and they had a fight just a day before he departed for the academy.\n\"Mom, please don't scold him once he returns. Although you only think the best of him, your words make him hate me more.\"\nSophie sighed as she cupped her son's cheek and said, \"Look at you…always looking out for him. And on the other hand, that child doesn't even see you as his brother.\"\nAiden fondly smiled at his mother, as he responded, \"Regardless of what he thinks, it doesn't change the fact that we are a family.\"\nSophie nodded in assent. She sometimes felt that maybe she had made wrong choices in the upbringing of her second son, and that's why the one who grew up away from him was so considerate and lovely.\n\"Your Highness,\" Suddenly the maid arrived in the room, even though Aiden had forbidden her to enter unless there was an emergency.\nThat means…\"What happened?\" Aiden got up from his seat, as he asked.\nThe maid was breathing roughly but she didn't delay in informing, \"The first prince…he just arrived.\"\n\"...!!\"\n°°°°°\nAustin was making his way toward his father's room without bothering to greet or react to the servants who saw him.\nFollowing him were Valerie and Sebastia, who decided to stick together with him, for the time being.\nJust as he was about to open the door and enter the room, \"Wait, don't go in!\"\nA familiar voice stopped him.\nAustin heaved a sigh, before asking, \"Why is that, mother?\"\nIt was strange that after rebirth, it was the first time for Austin to meet his mother, but he didn't feel anything in her presence. No connection, no warmth. She was just like any other person to him.\n\"Father is not well, so you shouldn't disturb him.\"\nEntering the scene was the most annoying person in existence.\nA concerned look marred his punchable face as Aiden said, \"You should wait for him to wake up, at least.\"\nAustin barely held himself from punching the guy who tried snatching his lover from him. A very thin border was restraining his aura from flooding out and letting each and every person in the palace know what emotion Austin held for his dear older brother.\nWith a strained smile that didn't hide his annoyance, Austin spoke, \"I need to meet him urgently, so I have to go inside.\"\n\"No, you can't! Can't you listen to your elders even once?\" Sophie suddenly held his hand and pulled him away from the door.\nValerie frowned, seeing her Lord being insulted by the woman. Not even God has the right to behave rudely to him.\nAustin rolled his eyes, and was about to say something when suddenly, \"Austin…\"\nA voice arrived from the inside…and none of the five were unaware of whom this voice belonged.\n\"Austin…\" He called out again, and soon the doors were parted from the inside.\nA grey-haired butler appeared from the other side, and said, \"Your father is looking for you, Your Highness.\"\nAiden gritted his teeth in annoyance, 'When I went to ask for his decision, that old fart was playing dead. And now suddenly, he is alive?!'\nRegardless of what he thought, Austin removed his hand from the lady's hold before stepping inside the room.\nValerie and Sebastian remained standing outside and even the King's personal butler and Sebastian's brother stood outside of the room, leaving only the father and the son inside.\n°°°°°°\nAustin took a deep breath once his eyes landed on the old man…who was looking much older than the last time he saw him.\n\"Dying so soon? I thought you had some promises to fulfill?\"\nCedric laughed; however, that only made his dry throat hurt, ushering Austin to pour some water for the old man.\nHelping Cedric to first sit down, Austin brought the glass to his lips.\nThe blond one took a few sips of water slowly before he detached the glass from his lips, and while holding his son's hand, he uttered,\n\"Thank you for responding to my request…\"\nThere was a certain fondness in his eyes when he said that.\nAustin couldn't help but sigh as he said, \"You have summoned me when I was having my sweet time in the academy…I hope this should be something important.\"\nCedric grimly nodded, \"Yes…it is.\"\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Chapter 89- Pest\nOutside the room, Valerie and Aiden were the only ones standing since Sebastian was asked to accompany the queen. Apparently, she wanted to ask a few things from the butler regarding Austin.\nValerie was silently standing by the door, with her arms crossed.\nLast night was really eventful for her. Riding the horse with her beloved leaning on her was quite an experience.\nEvery time he mumbled in his sleep or frowned, she patted his head and soothingly whispered, 'It's okay, I am here...' and he soundly fell asleep.\nThat gave her a different type of sensation compared to the other times when she spent her time with him. After all, last night, it wasn't him teasing her or flirting with her. Rather, it was her taking care of him...and that gave birth to a very new sensation in her.\nIt was...addictive.\n\"Lady Valerie, how have you been doing?\"\nTo break her pleasant mood, the eye sore spoke.\nShe didn't have much of a conversation with Aiden in the past and her impression of him was shallow...until her Lord informed her about Aiden's real side.\nThe manipulative bastard just wants to separate Austin from his family and take over the throne. Disgusting unnecessary creature.\n\"Quite busy lately,\" Valerie responded in a dry tone.\nAiden heaved a sigh, \"I could see that my brother has been bothering you quite-\"\n\"No, that's not it,\" Valerie interrupted him, \"Austin doesn't keep me busy...rather it's my search for that pest who manipulated my father, who has kept me busy recently.\"\nAiden flinched; his whole person turned still upon hearing that, but from the front, he seemed unfazed.\nTurning towards the silver-haired guy, Valerie added, \"If you find that person who convinced my father that Austin is not worthy of me, please inform me. Even at the cost of my own life, I won't hesitate to slay that roach.\"\nThe conviction in her voice and the subtle blood lust that Valerie didn't hide made Aiden shiver.\nTaking a strong gulp, he said, \"I will try to find the person. Now if you will excuse me,\"\n\"Yes, sure.\" Valerie nodded as she saw the roach crawling away.\n°°°°°°°\nAustin heaved a sigh after hearing what was the case.\nSo, Hener sent a proposal that they would lend a helping hand if Eryndor disowned Austin and exiled him.\nIt was amusing how they were not trying to hide their animosity against Austin. Something that happened between two children is now being dragged to national-level politics.\nHow...childish.\n\"So your council members are suggesting you take this step, I guess?\" Austin asked the obvious.\nHe knew the influence of Aiden on the people here, who run the government. Even if Cedric shows reluctance in front of several agreements, he would have no option but to make the hard choice.\n\"Austin…they are convinced that under the pretense of exiling you, they would be able to protect you.\" Holding his hand firmly, the older one added, \"But I have a bad feeling about this.\"\nAustin exhaled an audible breath; surely this was a wrong call.\nKnowing Aiden, Austin knew he would be executed during his exile and the blame would land on Hener. And since, during his banishment, he wouldn't be the Prince of anywhere, Eryndor wouldn't be able to blame anyone.\nHener happy. Aiden happy.\n'What a good plan you made …' Austin's train of thought was broken by his father,\n\"Austin…I am prepared to fight Drenovar without any external support-\"\n\"And lose your kingdom and the lives of numerous people in the process? Be practical, father.\"\nAustin's instant rejection took the man by surprise. He thought that saying so would fuel Austin with motivation and he would support his decision.\nHowever, \"Fighting that giant named Drenovar needs three times the forces we have now, along with a massive supply of equipment. In our current situation, only demise awaits for Eryndor if we get into a full-fledged war with them.\"\nCedric asked, \"Then…you mean to say ….I can't allow that!\"\nAustin heaved a weary sigh, \"First listen to me, old man. I also won't offer myself as a sacrificial lamb, so calm down.\"\nCedric settled down. He was a bit too charged up for someone critically ill.\nAustin thought for a moment. His plans were all messed up after he heard the news. Hener has played dirty but Austin doesn't have the time to pay attention to them.\nHis focus was Drenovar at the moment.\n\"Father, I have a way to resolve this situation without letting the two nations collide.\"\nCedric frowned, \"Is there really a way to appease Drenovar?\"\nAustin nodded, \"I know a way, but for that, you need to give me some time. For the next ten days, you need to delay your decision about exiling me and stop any kind of plan your councilmen might have to retaliate.\"\n\"If Eryndor launches even a single attack against Drenovar, everything would be ruined.\"\nCedric took a deep breath. The way he sounded forced the older man to trust his words.\n\"I will take care of that, but Austin, do you really have a way?\"\n\"Why would I lie about something so dangerous? Drenovar can swallow Eryndor, so unless I have a fullproof plan, I wouldn't stick my hand into this mess.\" Austin replied with a frown.\nCedric slowly raised his hand and cupped his cheek. Softly, he asked, \"Promise me, you won't risk your life for this.\"\nAustin looked at the man, before asking, \"Did you promise your father the same thing when you went to fight the demonic army back when you were just a teenager?\"\nCedric was rendered speechless. His eyes widened, as he asked, \"How do…you…\"\nAustin shook his head, \"It doesn't matter, father. We both know that our lives will always remain under threat until we are alive, so taking risks is a given. However, I can promise you that I will not foolishly jump into danger.\"\n\"I can't ask anything more from you.\" Resting his hand on Austin's shoulder, the King said, \"Go conquer the enemy son.

      "content": "Chapter 91: Chapter 90- Departure already?\n[A few minutes ago]\nIn the reception hall, only two people could be seen.\nOn the Queen's orders, Sebastian followed her, and for the past five minutes, all the lady did was sip on her tea.\n\"How have you been doing recently, Sebastian? Does my son trouble you?\" She spoke for the first time.\nSebastian honestly responded, \"No, Your Majesty. He is a very sensible person for his age.\"\nSophie's left brow went up, \"Are you sure we are talking about the same person?\"\nSebastian expertly held a slight laugh as he responded, \"Indeed, madame. Although the young master had a bad temper initially when I started serving him, recently, his personality has changed for good.\"\n\"Talking about recent activities, you stopped reporting about Austin.\" She said, but it sounded more like a question to the butler.\n\"I was forbidden by the master I serve, Your Majesty.\" Sebastian simply responded. He was not forbidden by his lord to hide the fact. However, even though Austin never told him not to tell anyone about the contract, Sebastian wasn't going to mention it to anyone.\nThe silver-haired woman gave him a side-long glance before asking, \"What exactly has he been doing that he told you not to inform us?\"\nRecently, she heard that Austin was involved in some mess in which the Prince of Hener got blamed. She doesn't have the information about the whole incident since her husband refused to tell her, but she already assumed that it must be Austin's fault.\nSebastian remained staring at the woman for a moment longer than what could have been regarded as appropriate before he uttered,\n\"He has been involved with several events recently. For example, when he won the trials of the Tournament-\"\n\"Austin won the trials?\" Sophie asked in surprise.\nWith a smile, Sebastian nodded, \"Yes, and he is participating from the elite division.\"\nFor a moment, Sebastian saw the glimmer of warmth and fondness in Sophie's eyes for her son…but like it was nothing but an illusion, her cold look returned.\n\"Must have been favored by the headmaster…anyway, once Austin graduates, you need to return to the capital and help Aiden in handling the administration.\"\nSebastian held a sigh. The Queen has already declared the next king in her heart. How…strange.\n\"As you say, Your Majesty.\"\n°°°°°\n\"Robert.\" The personal butler of the King flinched upon finding someone appearing behind him without him noticing.\n\"...brother…\" Thankfully, the amount of people who could achieve such a feat was still one.\n\"You have adapted to your role as a butler quite well.\" Sebastian praised his little brother with a proud smile on his face.\nRobert allowed a rare scowl to appear on his face, \"This uniform is so goddamn tight. And there is a restriction on so many things.\"\nSebastian chuckled. It was not surprising to see that his brother was suffering slightly in this new job.\nFor someone who has been working as a mercenary for the past eight years, it was understandable why he hates rules so much.\nResting his hand on his brother's shoulder, Sebastian spoke, \"You are doing a fine job, brother. There are many who want to take Your Majesty's life; that's why I assigned you since I knew only you can be trusted with this job.\"\nRobert heaved a sigh, \"That's true…recently, I discovered that he was being fed poison through his food.\"\nSebastian frowned. He knew that something was up, but he still didn't have the details, so he asked, \"Did you catch the traitor?\"\nRobert shook his head, \"He was dead, the newly assigned cook.\"\nSebastian's frown deepened. He had a hunch that it must be the newly assigned cook since the other cooks and chefs were recruited by Sebastian after careful consideration and thorough background inspection. They would end their life rather than choose to betray their Lord.\n\"Did you find any traces?\"\nRobert shook his head, \"None. I went to check where he lived, and from what I got, it seemed the bastard was not from the capital but somewhere outside. No lead about the true culprit.\"\nSebastian narrowed his eyes, \" Bringing a foreigner to the capital and giving him a job in the palace…surely someone with authority could do that.\"\nBefore Sebastian could ask, Robert told him, \"I couldn't track who recruited him. Upon asking, one signaled towards the other…\"\nSebastian nodded, \"Naturally if they are conspiring against the King, they must have been thorough in their planning.\" he concluded with a frustrated sigh.\nUnfortunately, Sebastian couldn't stay in the capital and investigate the matter himself, or he might have found some clue.\nHe couldn't blame Robert for not being able to find anything since his younger brother had to pay attention to the King's safety, so it was understandable if he couldn't reach the root of the problem.\nAfter thinking for a few moments, Sebastian said, \"Do you still have the Dectro?\"\nRobert rolled his eyes, \"You still remember that name?\" Saying so, he took out a small compass from his pocket.\nSeveral memories came to his mind, seeing the compass in his brother's hand. They used to play hide and seek in the past, and whenever Robert's turn came to find others, he used the artifact he got from their father.\n\"Does it still work?\" Sebastian asked and got a nod in response.\n\"Okay, so whenever the Queen talks or meets someone, you need to use Dectro to see if someone is using their Soul energy.\"\nRobert raised his brows, \" Did you sense something?\"\nSebastian's brows drew closer, \"I can't be sure…but I think the Queen is under the influence of a spell that is making her antagonize Young Lord Austin.\"\nRobert heaved a sigh, \"But I don't remain always around the Queen. It's her personal maid, Vanessa.\"\nSebastian flashed a teasing smile, \"If it's a woman, I think you can manage.\"\nThe siblings shared a grin.\n°°°°°°\n\"Are you returning right away?\" Just as Austin got out of the room and began walking with Valerie by his side, Aiden appeared out of nowhere.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"A competition is going on back in school, so I need to return.\"\nAiden raised his brows, \"You…really are returning to school?\"\nAustin, with a smile, said, \"Want to drop me off at school, big brother?\"\nAiden chuckled, \"That's too far away. I think you will be able to take care of yourself.\"\nAustin nodded, \"Okay then, see you.\" Without any further ado, Austin held Valerie's hand and walked out.\nAs Austin walked away, Aiden's smile dropped, as he muttered under his breath,\n'This is suspicious….I need to investigate this whole farce.'\nNot in seven hell, Austin suddenly came here to just check on his father and would return to the academy just like that.\n'That old man must have informed Austin about the proposal from Hener…' In that case, what Austin could do? Run away? But that would just give Hener the best opportunity to slay the rogue prince.\n'What exactly are you planning…'\n°°°°°°\n\"My lord, are we leaving right away?\" Sebastian asked as he spotted the young master and lady walking out of the palace.\nAustin nodded, \"Have you arranged a carriage?\"\nSebastian was taken aback, \"Are we leaving on a carriage?\" Sebastian had no problem with that, but surely, in a carriage, it would take much longer.\n\"Austin is tired, so it's better to travel in a carriage,\" Valerie spoke, bringing a warm smile to Austin's lips.\nHowever, \"That carriage would be a diversion, Sebastian. We are still traveling on horses.\"\nSebastian raised his brows before he glanced behind the Prince, \"Are we….\"\nAustin nodded, \"Most likely.\"\nValerie glanced between the two men, confused about what was happening.\nAustin held her hand and interlaced their fingers before saying, \"Let me escort you to somewhere safe.\"\nSebastian had already disappeared and went to arrange the carriage while Austin and Valerie walked through the back garden of the palace.\n\"How was he? Your Majesty?\" Valerie asked.\nAustin raised his brows, \"Still formality?\"\nValerie lowered her gaze, a shy smile lifting the edges of her lips, as she asked, \"How is he…father-in-law?\" A gentle reminder that they are about to get married…yup, all her displeasure after meeting that pest has been wiped off.\n\"He is doing good…the poison would be negated within a few days with proper rest and adequate nutrition.\"\nValerie raised her brows, \"Is it safe for him to stay here when that person is targeting him?\"\nAustin nodded, \"I trust Robert. He will take care of him.\"\nValerie suddenly stood before Austin before saying, \"What about your mother…it seems she is under Aiden's influence, just as my father was. And late at night, in the bedroom, only a wife is allowed to enter the room.\"\nAustin's brows drew closer. What Valerie is suggesting is true. During the night, even the closest servant couldn't remain around their primary because of obvious reasons.\nAnd if, under Aiden's influence, the Queen ends up harming the King…\nSqueezing her hand, Austin said, \"I can just hope that my dear mother still has that much sanity to discern what is right and what is evil.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

So Valerie,\" Austin, while parting his lap, said, \"Come rest here.\"\nThe girl was taken aback by the sudden proposal, as she said, \"B-But my head is heavy...\"\n\"Your tip-to-toe is light as a feather, so stop making excuses and come here.\" Austin was not going to let her refuse this time. She has been restlessly moving around since yesterday, unlike him, who got plenty rest last night\nNaturally, he was planning to let Sebastian rest as well once they reached the great forest, but for now, the man was busy driving the carriage.\n\"Then ..if you'll excuse me...\" Shyly, the violet-haired rested a very small portion of her head on his lap.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Want me to put you on my lap and make you sleep like a baby?\"\nValerie instantly rested her head on his thigh properly. That baby part would have been too much!\nAustin warmly smiled at the girl as he tugged her hair strands behind her ear and whispered, \"Relax when you have the time. We have a long journey waiting ahead.\"\nValerie blinked in confusion, \"Are we not going to meet Father?\"\nAustin's heart clenched in guilt. It wasn't that he forgot about his promise to meet his father-in-law, rather, it was the situation that didn't allow him.\n\"Val...I am sorry, but we need to go to Drenovar first.\"\nHe knew the importance of meeting Lord Corwon—to let him know about their relationship and assure him that Austin would take care of his daughter. However, at the moment, Austin's focus was on Eryndor's safety.\nThat's why he postponed the plan of meeting him.\nValerie shook her head as she held his hand and told him, \"You need not feel apologetic about it. You are not avoiding meeting him for a nonsensical reason. It's about national importance and your father's safety, so my father would understand.\"\nAustin looked at Valerie with a strange look in his eyes.\nEven though he knew she would say something like that, hearing how she wasn't angry about his change of plans made him momentarily stunned.\n'Luke, you can't even keep a promise?! How unreasonable!'\n'Seriously, you made me wait here in the sun for ten long minutes?! You are the worst!'\n'Be more responsible or break up. That's it.'\nHe couldn't help but think of his past lovers, which he strictly didn't want to think about in Valerie's presence, who always complained at the slightest mistake or change in plans. And here...\n\"Ah..\" A soft exclaim of shock escaped her lips when, suddenly, Austin lowered himself and kissed her lips.\nThe sudden intimacy took her by surprise; that explains why the violette turned completely stiff.\nOnce their lips parted, Austin stared into her sparkling eyes as he heard her, \"So suddenly...\"\n\"Just felt like it. Did you not like it?\"\nValerie smiled before she lifted herself a little and pecked his lips, \"Loved it.\"\n°°°°°°°\n[After an hour]\nThere were three borders of the capital; two of them were visible, and one was not.\nAfter crossing the third border, Austin called out, \"Sebas, we will march towards the nearest town and hire a few horses.\"\n\"Understood, sir.\"\nAustin glanced at Valerie and got a nod from her.\nOnce Austin ensured that they were in a dense forest and the sight of the three would be impossible to track, Austin commanded,\n\"GO!\"\nAustin and Valerie, along with Sebastian, darted away from the carriage while a man with the same dress as Sebastian got out of the small bracket under the driver's seat and began driving the carriage.\nThose who were following the carriage remained tailing the carriage while the three of them darted in another direction.\nTheir form was a blur, and that high speed thoroughly surprised Valerie and Sebastian.\n'His growth is mind wobbling.' Sebastian inwardly thought.\n'My Lord is so amazing.' Valerie smiled in pride, seeing how her beloved had been progressing rapidly.\nOnce they reached the town, Austin summoned a small cloth to hide his face.\nValerie did the same since they would have easily gotten the attention of people.\n\"We should take a break and eat something first,\" Austin suggested.\nSebastian nodded, \"I will go and look for the hors-\"\n\"No, you should also eat with us, Sebas. You aren't a machine.\"\nSebastian was monetarily stunned as he glanced at the lady and found her nodding in assent, \"Don't push yourself too much, Sebastian.\" Valerie added.\nLost in words, Sebastian sighed before ushering, \"Okay then, let's go to a place I know.\"\nThe two teenagers followed the man before they entered a certain eatery named Billar'd bars\nThere were not many people around, so they got themselves a seat easily.\nOnce they were seated, a waiter came, \"What would you like to order, sir?\"\n\"Ah, one mushroom gratin,\" Sebastian spoke first.\nAustin raised his brows, \"Is it good?\" Getting a nod with a smile, Austin also ordered the same, followed by Valerie.\nOnce the waiter walked away, Austin said, \"Sebastian, how far is the WarpMail center from here?\"\nSebastian thought for a moment before he answered, \"If we are going to the great forest, it would be in the route and will take two hours on a horse. But young master, who are you sending the letter to?\"\nAustin heaved a sigh before he revealed vaguely, \"There is someone who Morkel used to report about me. However, now Morkel is working for me, so I want Morkel to affirm my arrival in the academy if he is asked.\"\nAustin couldn't reveal that the person in question was Aiden. Since until now, he doesn't have any evidence against the First Prince, which could make Sebastian realize the bastard's true nature.\nSebastian didn't ask any further questions, but he already had a clear idea of the person Austin had been so wary of.\n'I hope your suspicion is proven to be wrong...or this family would never become one, my lord.'\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Sebastian still has hopes that this family could become one, somehow.\nAnd a serious question. Is this pace good? I feel it's slightly fast paced, no?",

He doesn't have the luck of the Protagonist and the worst part is that he is the Prince of the nation they are planning to take their revenge on.\n'Well, I think there is still some hope…' Now all depends on whether he could find the Eternal Flower and extract its essence.\n'System, what's the status?'\n[Ding!]\n[Combat: 41/100]\n[You have unlocked a reward!]\n{Next reward at 60}\n[Romance: 42->50/100]\n{Next reward at 60}\n[Durability: 53/100]\n{Next reward at 60}\n[Trickery: 33/100]\n{Next reward at 35}\n[Overall Progression: 43/100]\n[Next Reward at 50]\n…\nAustin was too sleepy last night to notice the reward, and when he reached the capital, his attention was completely diverted.\n'But…how did my romance stat develop?'\nAustin received no response from the system, but Austin didn't need an answer in the first place since he soon realized what changed.\n'Okay, open the reward.'\n[Ding!]\n[Kinetic Charge: Accumulates energy through combat, including movement, damage taken, and damage inflicted. The stored energy can be released in a single, devastating attack.]\n[Limitation: Can be used once after five hours of complete body rest.]\n[Note: Can be upgraded using status points]\n…\nAustin's brows were raised in surprise. He understood the application of the skill and was quite excited to use it.\n'Launching the accumulated force of combat…nice.' And the recovery time was low as well.\n\"Young master, we are here.\" Seeing Sebastian slowing down his horse, Austin and Valerie followed suit.\nIt was the first time for Austin to be here, given the dangers of the place. However, he wasn't completely lost because in the game he has come here several times.\nThe great forest stretched endlessly, its towering trees casting deep shadows over the land. Thick vines curled around ancient trunks, and the air buzzed with the sounds of unseen creatures.\nThey could hear the rustle of creatures everywhere, once in a while, Austin spotted a few eyes of those beasts looking at them. However, despite being so close to them, they chose to retreat because of a single person.\n\"Should we stop here or go deeper?\"\nValerie asked as she remained on top of the horse while looking around.\nAustin hummed before saying, \"Sebas, arrange a camp here since it will take some time to find the Eternal Flower.\"\nSebastian nodded, \"Understood, sir.\"\nAustin jumped off the horse and helped Valerie get off as well, before he said, \"Want to come along and discover a little?\"\nValerie smiled, \"Sure.\"\nLeaving the old man behind, the duo embarked on a little journey to explore the forest a little.\nWith their hands connected, Austin moved carefully so as not to trip and make them both fall down.\nThe forest was too dense and dark, that's why Austin took out a small flare and lit it up.\nIt was quite exciting to visit the forest, which he had seen only in the game. Although the graphics cannot be compared to the real vision at all, he could identify a few things based on his memory.\n\"I was thinking…it would take us much longer to reach the Drenovar through a straight route.\" Valerie suddenly spoke, which made him curious.\n\"Do you have any better route in mind?\"\nValerie responded with the plan she had been formulating for the whole journey, \"If we travel to our west, we will reach the water bodies in a day, at most. And by hiring a fireheart vessel we could reach Drenovar in one day.\"\nAustin hummed—this was actually a good idea. It will take almost four days for them to reach Drenovar if they travel on horses, and even if they only take a couple of hours of rest.\nHowever, using the waterways would surely shorten the time since Drenovar was situated on the shore of the Ocean of Separation.\nHowever, \"Two problems,\" Austin began, \"First, because I used WarpMail, I don't have funds to rent a Fireheart Vessel.\"\n\"I can give you the money!\" Valerie instantly added, ushering Austin to pause and look at her.\nValerie's enthusiasm died as she slowly whispered, \"I have got them through monster subjugation in the past. I have no use for that money, so please use it.\"\nShe became hesitant because she suddenly remembered something her mother told her a few years back,\n'It hurts a man's ego to get help, especially financial help from their woman. So be very careful.'\nShe was anxious that she might have insulted him, but Austin suddenly chuckled, \"I don't mind using your savings...but is that really okay?\"\nValerie was momentarily stunned seeing him being nonchalant. But then, putting her Lord in the same category as the other men is truly blasphemous for her.\nWith a smile, she nodded, \"Yes, there could be no greater purpose for using this money.\"\nAustin smiled at the girl before a sigh soon seeped through his lips, \"But there is one more problem.\"\nValerie raised her brows, urging Austin to add,\n\"The port from where we could take the Vessel and the whole city on the West is under the Union Council's control.\"\nThe Ocean of Separation separates the human world from the Demon's domain. That's why, the nearest city to that border was where the Council's headquarters was situated.\nAnd if they spot Valerie there, they surely would investigate the matter, given an S-rank moving around between nations could never be good news.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"We are already doing it covertly, but hiding from Council would be too difficult.\"\nThe duo turned silent and decided to make the decision after discussing it with Sebastian.\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you are liking their development.

      "content": "Chapter 94: Chapter 93- Against the Golem\nWhen the sun approaches the horizon, the last droplet of sunlight falls on it.\nThe brightest flower of the world, that contains the remedy of every contamination.\nThe scent which could make one dazed, and lose the sense of direction.\nStanding apart from all its brethren is the red-blooming flower that only appears once in a thousand years.\nAustin remembers these lines, which, as the character Rhea, he collected as hints to find the Eternal Flower.\nThe sun was about to go down and he was slowly identifying the traces of those places which he once saw through a monitor screen.\n\"Are you tired?\" Austin asked since they had been walking for the past one and a half hours.\nValerie shook her head, \"No, not at all. It's just...this place is quite unsettling.\" She said while looking around and sensing various hostile presences.\n\"Well, this is the ultimate training ground for a warrior. They often come here as a newbie, and when they leave, they leave as a veteran warrior.\"\nValerie nodded, \"Indeed; I only have come here once even though my house is so near to this place.\"\nValerie was allowed to subjugate monsters by participating in raids. However, her father had forbidden her to come into the great forest because of the dangers lurking there.\nHowever, she has came here once, by going against her father words.\nIt was the day when she had an argument with Austin...well, not argument, rather, it was one-sided.\nThe day was when Austin clearly told her to go away from his life and never show her face in front of him. He also demanded her to never reveal the fact in the academy, that they are engaged.\nTo forget about what happened, she came here and fought seven A-rank beasts one after another, and that led to the third evolution of her Shard.\nRemembering that day...and seeing how close they are today, Valerie couldn't help but smile in contentment.\nAlthough the path was full of thorns, she had finally reached the position in life she had always dreamed of.\n\"We are reaching it,\" Austin spoke, a sudden rush of excitement she could feel from him, as he pulled her.\nCrossing a few more meters and barely avoiding the thick roots snaking across the ground, they finally stepped into a clearing—an unexpected break in the dense, endless forest.\n\"What is...this scent?\" Valerie was amazed by the sudden sweet smell that assaulted her nose as she looked around to find the source.\nAustin warned, \"Cover your nose or you will get under its hypnosis.\"\nValerie heeded his words and instantly pulled the makeshift mask she had made earlier with a piece of her clothes.\nAustin's eyes narrowed as he saw the long curved tree that was flowing towards the sky and had a peculiar design of leaves.\nHe couldn't be mistaken about it—the Eternal Flower is within the bark of the tree.\nAustin released Valerie's hand, and told her, \"Unless I am about to die, don't interfere.\"\nHearing the word 'die' made her panic as she instinctively asked, \"What are you going to do?!\"\nAustin didn't reply to her; rather, he stepped toward the tree slowly. If his memory serves right—\n**KRIK**\nThe ground rumbled, and inches away from his feet, the surface caved in.\nAustin summoned his dagger and got ready for the battle.\nThe earth trembled as cracks spread across the ground. Dust and loose soil crumbled away, revealing a deep hollow beneath. A low, grinding noise echoed through the air like stone scraping against stone.\nThen, from the depths of the ground, something began to rise.\nA faceless figure, tall and broad, emerged from the earth. Its body was made of dark, rough stone, its surface covered in ancient carvings that pulsed faintly. As it pulled itself free, chunks of dirt and broken roots fell from its massive frame.\nIts head was smooth, without eyes, nose, or mouth, yet an eerie presence surrounded it. The golem's heavy limbs moved with slow, deliberate strength, cracks glowing faintly as energy coursed through its body.\nValerie held her breath upon seeing the Golem appearing out of nowhere, as she asked, \"Austin...please don't tell me you are going to fight it alone.\"\n\"That's the requirement, Val. I need to defeat that thing or we won't get that damn flower.\"\nAustin flexed the dagger in his hand, the size of the blade increasing as he crouched low and got into a fighting position.\nThe Golem took a step forward—\n**CLANG**\nThe deep sound of metal brushing against stone resonated as Austin launched into a blur and attacked it head-on, but as expected,\n\"Not a scratch.\"\nThe Golem turned its massive frame towards Austin, its featureless face showing no emotion, but Austin could tell that it had considered him as its opponent.\n\"My Shard won't do...\"\nValerie gasped. She covered her mouth as she saw her Lord suddenly summoning something that definitely wasn't his Shard.\nA double-edged axe with a majestic white handle and thunder wrapped around it, appeared in his hand as Austin prepared for another strike.\n'The battle axe makes me a little slower...but with this enemy, I just need to land a decisive blow on its neck.'\nAustin lunged forward, and this time, the Golem also moved faster, raising its hand, and several long roots erupted from the ground.\nAustin jumped on his feet and used the roots as a platform to launch toward the Golem.\nThunders crackled around him as he launched a front strike toward the Golem, but the thing easily swatted the attack away with its left hand and followed with a right punch.\nAustin twisted in midair, narrowly avoiding the full force of the golem's punch, but the sheer wind pressure sent him flying. He slammed into the ground, rolling several times before stopping on one knee. His body ached, his arms stung from the impact, but he had no time to breathe.\nThe golem was already moving, raising its massive foot to crush him.\nAustin gritted his teeth and kicked off the ground, barely dodging as the foot slammed down, sending a shockwave through the earth. He reached for his axe, but the golem's next attack was already coming. A thick root shot from the ground, wrapping around his ankle and pulling him\nOff balance.\n\"Tch!\" Austin swung his axe in a desperate arc, slicing the root apart just before another lashed toward him.\nHe rolled to the side and sprang forward, his axe crackling with thunder. He needed to go for the joints. The neck, the arms—any weak spot he could find.\nHe leaped, bringing the axe down on the golem's shoulder.\nCRACK!\nLightning surged through the blade as it struck, sending sparks flying. A deep fissure split the golem's stone body, and for the first time, it actually recoiled.\nBut then—\nTHUD!\nA stone fist slammed into Austin's stomach, sending him crashing into a tree. The impact stole the air from his lungs. He coughed, blood dripping from his lips as pain exploded in his ribs.\n\"That...hurt,\" he muttered, wiping his mouth.\n\"Austin! Are you okay?\" Valerie appeared beside him out of nowhere, with concern written over her face.\nAustin glanced at her, with a smile extending his lips, before he told her, \"Just a few minutes, sweetie.\"\nHis figure blurred in lightning as he appeared above the Golem\nThe inhumane raised its hand to grab Austin however, Austin phased through the arm, appearing behind the Golem before he struck the axe,\n**TING**\nLoud reverberation erupted, shaking the surface as the Golem was forced forward with that thunder-clad attack.\nHowever, before Austin could have thought of launching another attack, the Golem raised its foot and slammed it against the ground.\nThe surface trembled before several spikes began appearing from random spots.\nAustin's eyes widened as he jumped in time, or he would have been stabbed.\nLetting his Axe disintegrate, he flipped into the air, and landed on one of the branches, before a rock came flying his way,\n\"Shi-*CRACK*\"\n**BOOOOOM**\nHe jumped just in time before the rock took down the whole branch and launched into the air.\nAustin was airborne for a moment, as he assessed the battlefield.\nThe inhumane beast slammed its hand on the ground before a pillar of stone launched toward Austin.\nThe blond Prince twisted in the air, but it was not enough to dodge the incoming attacks, as he was sent flying way above.\n\"Guh!\"\nAustin groaned as he found some of his ribs snapping from that last attack, as he stood to stop the stone pillar.\nHe was above the forest roof and barely could see the Stone warrior staring back at him with its arm crossed.\n\"Quite cocky, you are,\" Austin growled as he received a notification,\n[Skill is ready to discharge!]\nA grin formed on his face, as Austin prepared for the final strike.\n'System, use my points to improve my Durability.'\n[Host is needed-]\nAustin didn't wait to respond and shot toward the Golem.\nThe stone pillar cracked upon his launch, as he moved toward the Golem straight ahead with his punch reeled back.\nThe Golem also didn't show any intention of moving away as it pulled its right hand back, its hand coiled in a punch.\nValerie held her breath and was prepared to jump in any moment now.\nHowever, she never expected the collision to be so devastating,\n**BOOOOOOM**\nThe instant their fists met, a massive shockwave ripped through the forest. Trees bent and snapped, the ground shattered, and debris blasted outward in every direction. A deafening explosion shook the air as lightning and raw force collided with unyielding stone.\nA deep, splitting noise echoed. The sheer impact sent a violent gust tearing through the battlefield, uprooting everything nearby. Dust and smoke surged like a storm, swallowing the scene in thick, blinding chaos.\nFor a long moment, nothing moved.\nThen, as the dust slowly settled…\nAustin stood tall, breathing hard, his figure outlined against the wreckage. His arm was reddened because of the impact. But the most noticeable thing was the pile of stones resting around him.\n'Haah...this was tougher than I thought..'\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Chapter 94- Reward\nAustin heaved a sigh as he finally defeated the Golem.\nIn the game, it took him three attempts to defeat the monster by himself.\nHowever, in real life, only one attempt was hefty, and Austin didn't have to retort on attacking the monster's weak points to win.\n'That Kinetic Charge was quite overpowered...' He looked at his charred fist and could feel the lingering energy still pulsating.\nHis arm wasn't broken, but a few fingers were dislocated.\nFor a moment, Austin felt he could even defeat God with that much strength…however, he soon realized he was overestimating himself.\n\"Are you okay? Does it hurt?\" Valerie appeared before him; very carefully, she lifted his hand and took out a vial of cooling potion.\nHowever, the moment she dropped it,\n**SSSZZ**\nThe liquid turned into mist and evaporated instantly.\n\"Ahaha…it's not that bad.\"\nValerie believed him…not.\nParting her lips, she used her Soul energy before blowing cold breathe over his burnt hand.\n\"Ah…\" Austin winced as the cold sensation assaulted him and provided him relief.\nHe…might have pushed himself a little there, but there was no better method to defeat the enemy.\nSeeing the cold wind directing from her lips, Austin was suddenly reminded of something, which he casually revealed,\n\"You know Val, why did I name my dagger Frostfang?\"\nValerie slowly lifted her eyes and stopped blowing over his wounded arm.\nWith a warm smile, he said, \"Because I wished to awaken an element as cool as yours.\"\nValerie's eyes widened slightly. She knew that he had named his Soul Shard but never did she expect him to name it with such an intention.\nLowering her eyes, she mumbled, \"But…you're already too cool. Earlier, you made my heart race.\"\nThe way she hid her face with his arm and the tips of her ears turned red aroused extreme sweet aggression as Austin ended up hugging the girl.\n\"Eh…w-why so suddenly…\"\nAustin complained, \"Blame yourself for being so adorable.\"\nThe girl might need to use her skill to cool down her head now…\n…\nBehind a tree, Sebastian heaved a sigh, as he decided to stay hidden for the time being.\nHis eyes traveled towards the broken wreckage in the middle of the clearing, as a thought passed through his mind,\n'That strength…could only be possessed by an elite A-rank…and even so if they have gained experience in combat…'\nSebastian had been watching the battle since the beginning but didn't interfere after he heard what his Lord told Lady Valerie.\nThe battle was quite interesting and surprising since his Lord summoned something that definitely wasn't his Shard. Not only that, the fighting skill and battle instincts he showed was surely far greater than the version of him who fought against Sebastian before the tournament.\n'This unnatural progression of yours is both awe-inspiring and concerning.'\nThere was no doubt that Sebastian was quite proud of seeing his Master getting better and better passing each day.\nAll those mockery and teasing he has faced until now. All those mouths that called him worthless and whatnot. Austin would get back to them with his achievements. As a student and as a Prince.\nHowever, with his current progression, it wouldn't be far off when the Union Council gets a whiff of it and they start to keep an eye on him.\nAs his butler, Sebastian would try his best to keep those unnecessary eyes away, however, if the Council really gets into it, it would be nearly impossible for the young lord to live a free life without the burden of becoming one of the Pillars of humanity.\n'I just hope you attain peace and happiness on whichever path you walk.'\n°°°°°°\nAfter Valerie 'healed' his arm, Sebastian appeared before them, \"I see that you have been through a brutal battle, my lord.\"\nAustin smiled, \"Well, it was a necessary struggle for the sweet reward.\"\nAustin turned towards the single tree in the vicinity, which hadn't been damaged despite the collision between him and the stone monster.\nHe approached the tree followed by the two.\nThe only reason Austin chose to face the monster alone—despite having Valerie by his side—was his knowledge of its abilities.\nLately, he had come to embrace difficult battles, but this time, his decision wasn't just about the challenge. He didn't want two S-ranks clashing at once.\nAfter all, the monster could adjust its strength to match its opponent\nNow, since Austin was B-rank at most, the golem easily adapted to the strength level and might have won if only Austin didn't have that cheat ability of Kinetic discharge, which made him a high ranker in that single moment—taking the monster by surprise.\n*Crunch*\nThe moment Austin's hand landed on the tree, its trunk began to wither, and turn grey.\nThe leaves began to fall, and the trunk became grey and dry as husk.\nAustin removed the obstacles before his eyes landed on the source which would pacify the situation between Drenovar and Eryndor.\n\"It's…beautiful…\" Valerie muttered as she looked at the flower.\nIt was a red blooming flower with three large petals, growing from the ground and radiating an ethereal glow. Each petal shimmers with a deep, almost otherworldly luster as if holding the glow of embers within.\nAustin heaved a sigh, 'In reality as well, I will only get three vials of the potion.'\nHe carefully began tearing the petal, and told Sebastian, \"Can you start boiling some water?\"\n\"Yes, right away.\" Sebastian went back to the camp before bringing the small stove and a wide pot filled with water.\nAustin carefully released the petals in the boiling water and saw it burning, yet no flames appeared.\nThe color of the water changed, taking a pretty crimson shade, as it got mixed with the water—becoming a potion worth billions of gold coins.\nOnce the petals completely got dissolved, Austin took out a vial from his pocket, before, with Sebastian help, he carefully poured the liquid in the vial.\nLooking at the crimson fluid resting inside, Austin muttered, \"We might save Eryndor from its possible doom with this.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I kept the pace since everyone liked it.

      "content": "Chapter 96: Chapter 95- Love\n\"Is that so?\" Aiden had a pretty smile on his face as he heard the report of the two soldiers he sent behind Austin and the other two.\nHe wanted to make sure that his dear younger brother reached the Academy safely. As a responsible older brother, it was the least he could have done for his beloved younger brother.\nHowever, the two soldiers who were after the carriage, completely lost track of them after crossing the city on the north. They said the carriage vanished all of a sudden.\nWow.\n*SQUELCH*\nA sword was pierced into the man on the left, his blood gushing out from the cut, as he struggled to breathe, \"How diligently do you two receive the monthly wages?\"\n*PULL*\n*SQUELCH*\n\"Aghhhh!\"\nPulling the blade, he stabbed the soldier again, using his skill to make them lose their focus and leave no room for retaliation.\nWith a smile never leaving his face, he pulled the sword again, \"And when I truly needed you,\" *STAB*\n\"Ahhhhh! Young master! Ple-pleass...d-d-don't kill me...m-my family...\"\nAiden's grin widened, \"Oh you have a family? Then surely, I can't let them experience the pain of living without you right?\" Those words caused the dying soldier's eyes to widen in shock, as he begged,\n\"P-Pl-Please...\"\nAiden snarled before pulling out his sword and beheading the man at once.\n*Thud*\nThe head of the man fell to the ground followed by his lifeless body.\nAiden allowed his Shard to disintegrate before he turned towards the other one.\n\"You...your name is Aton, right? How much do you love your life?\"\nThe soldier fell to his knees, and with his head lowered, he voiced, \"Just one chance, sir...I will even kill the Second Prince for you.\" His voice was shaky and the whole person looked on the verge of fainting under the effect of Aiden's skill.\nAiden rolled his eyes, \"I will be doing the honor of killing that swine. You just need to go and check whether he has actually reached the academy or not. If you don't return by the third day, you know what will happen to you.\"\nThe soldier didn't utter another word before disappearing from the room.\nAiden heaved a sigh, before he called out, \"Send someone to clean this mess.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nAustin discussed the plan with Sebastian regarding renting a Vessel from the port and reaching Drenovar through waterways.\n\"That ..is a good plan and would give us some breathing space during our visit.\" Sebastian voiced.\nAfter reaching Drenovar, they would need to first assess the situation before executing their plan, and considering only thirteen days remain before the tournament begins, they need to make it quick.\nNow, under these circumstances, using the straight path would take a lot of time in traveling and very little time to prepare. Not to talk about the exhaustion of the journey and possible battles they might need to face en route.\nAs such, \"We should follow the plan Lady Valerie suggested.\" Sebastian landed on the decision.\n\"Then what about the Council?\" Austin asked.\nSebastian told them, \"I can help you disguise completely. However, under no circumstances could you two get into a battle with anyone when we were there since after your battle, Young Master, you had during the trials would surely have piqued the Council's curiosity.\"\nAustin nodded, \"True. Then we are taking the risk and renting the Vessel.\"\nOn that note, everyone finished their dinner and decided to call it a day.\n....\nAustin was sitting by the campfire, keeping an eye on the surroundings.\nNaturally, in this environment, it would be dangerous for everyone to sleep.\nSebastian volunteered to remain awake, but Austin used his authority as his master and told him to immediately go to sleep.\nUnlike Austin and Valerie, who got some hours of rest during their journey, the older one hadn't slept a wink since he left the Academy.\n'Ah, that reminds me System...what were you saying when I launched toward the Golem?' Austin remembered that he told the system to improve his Durability before he went for the frontal attack.\n[The host has to specify how many points need to be used to increase Durability stats.]\n\"...\" Austin was rendered speechless for a moment, before he asked, 'Did you not improve my Durability then?'\n[No, host :)]\nThe audacity of the system to put that smiley near the end...\nA frown marred Austin's face as he asked, 'Then how did I tank that much recoil and the force behind the Golem's attack without breaking my arm?'\nThat much force would have shattered his arm completely and might have led to some serious damage. However, all Austin broke was his middle and index finger.\n[Ding!]\n[The Kinetic Discharge creates a field of energy around the discharge point, that prevents the host from taking any recoil damage.]\nAustin raised his brows, 'Then what about the punch of that Golem.'\n[The host's physical tolerance is much more than his tolerance toward extreme heat and cold, due to his last confrontation against the Giants.]\nAustin hummed; understandable.\nThe fact is that his stats only increase when all the sub-stats increase.\nHis physical stats might continue to increase, but until he doesn't improve his tolerance toward other things, like hot, cold, poison, and potions, he won't be able to progress his Durability.\nAnd because of that, he needs to ask for some quests.\n'Well, not now, since I need to focus on the task at hand.' He couldn't have himself drugged under the requirement of the quest while he was on his way to Drenovar. It would be disastrous.\n*Scruff*\nAustin heard something shuffling from his left but he didn't panic, and asked,\n\"Can't sleep?\"\nValerie slowly came out of the small tent Sebastian had planted earlier.\nThe man himself was sleeping in a sleeping bag under the starry sky while offering the small tent to the two teenagers.\nValerie sat down on the same log as him and shook her head, \"I already had plenty of rest.\"\nShe extended her hands and allowed her reddened hands to get some much-needed warmth.\nThe month was nearing Polaris—the last four months that ended a year, which explains the sudden temperature drop.\nAustin summoned a blanket from his inventory while pretending to pull it from beside him before he draped it over her shoulder and scooted closer to get into the same blanket.\n\"Let me warm you up.\" Austin held her cold hands between his and rubbed them softly.\nThe sudden intimacy made the girl's cheeks glow with slight crimson but the smile on her face made it clear that she welcomed the closeness.\nFor a few moments, there was silence between them. The only sound around them was the crackling fire and the hooting of nocturnals.\nBreaking the ice, Austin asked, \"Val, what aim did you have when you joined the Academy?\"\nValerie was surprised by being asked about her intentions suddenly.\nFor a moment, she thought of making up some pretty lies, but then, she had already taken an oath to never lie to her beloved.\nLowering her gaze, and a smile extending the edges of her lips, she said, \"I...see you as my idol. Back then, I only wished to walk on the same path as you, that's why I joined the academy.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"You...didn't come here because this was your best choice?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"I actually...got an invitation from Ravencourt when the news of my Third Evolution went out.\"\nAustin's eyes widened. The Ravencourt?!\nThe strongest nation in existence, and the academy ranking at the top?\nA student dreams of studying in that prestigious Academy and three Pillars of Union have been admitted from the central academy of Ravencourt.\n\"Val...you rejected that offer because of me?\"\nValerie instantly shook her head, \"It wasn't like I rejected them solely because of you since I didn't want to betray my homeland...but yes, majorly, it was because I wanted to be near you.\"\nShe turned silent after that.\nAustin heaved a long sigh upon hearing that. She has rejected the offer to join the Council and the greatest academy out there just because of him.\nValerie was slightly anxious that her Lord might tell her that she was wrong in making such a rash decision. However,\n\"Truth to be told...I can't say that I am disappointed in your decision. True...you would have made your name worldwide if you had joined that academy...but still,\"\nWith a smile that was warmer than the campfire, Austin said, \"...I am happy that you stayed by my side. Thank you, Valerie.\"\nValerie's eyes kept on his; a lot of words were exchanged, but not a word was spoken.\nThey just kept looking at each other for a long time, and that was enough to tell her how glad he was that she didn't go.\nThey, slowly, were understanding each other's emotions better...feelings closer as the day passed.\nThere were numerous emotions they had felt for each other in the past. Grief, betrayal, regret, and whatnot.\nHowever, beyond all those thorny paths, what remained was the beautiful feeling of love.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Happy Valentine's Day. Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Chapter 96- A sudden obstacle\nThe next day, early in the morning, they first ate something and took a bath in the nearby lake before changing their clothes.\nNow, on their horses, they were heading toward their west, where the port city was located.\nIt would take almost a day to reach there that's why Sebastian has already packed some meat for the journey, since the path to the west wasn't covered with dense forest. And taking a break to visit a town would be dangerous.\nThankfully, there was no one on their tail even after they stayed at one place for the whole night. Sebastian made sure of that.\nNow, on the horse, Austin asked the system,\n'How many points do I have now?'\n[Current points: 176]\nAustin hummed; the giants, in comparison to those warriors back in the first dungeon, gave many more points, and it wasn't like the more he defeated, the more points got reduced.\nHis first goal was to unlock the Shop feature since Austin has a feeling it would be quite beneficial in the long run.\nHe has read in several novels and mangas, how the Shop feature allowed several items useful within and outside dungeons.\nBut for now, he couldn't afford to go inside the dungeon again since he had to cross the distance as soon as he could and reach the port without becoming a burden on the other two.\n'I need to be careful about my itch for battle...' Recently, Austin has realized that he has been craving battles more and more. Was it a good trait?\n\"Young master!\" Sebastian suddenly brought his horse to a pause, and following suit, Austin and Valerie also halted before they looked into the distance and realized the reason behind his concern.\n\"Checkpost, huh. Not something unexpected.\" This route led to the headquarters of the Union Council—the most important body of the human side.\nNaturally, there would be checkpoints at several turns.\nThere was forest on either side of the path—not as dense as the Great Forest—and in the middle of the path were long barricades with several soldiers standing on either side.\n\"The barbed fence isn't spread for a long distance, so are we still using our original plan?\" Valerie added, as they got down from the horses and hid them in the forest.\nHowever, \"We can't,\" Sebastian spoke, as he pointed towards the forest, \"They have planted traps in the forest.\"\nAustin frowned and looked at the place he was pointing.\nBeneath the muddy lands and between the tree leaves, there indeed were some steel teeth and marks of human movements.\n'That...was not expected.' The last time Sebastian visited the Council, there weren't any traps. The soldiers were sufficient to track if anyone tried to use the other route to pass. However, it seems they have added another layer of security; that is why he even suggested taking this route in the first place.\nAustin looked around and asked, \"How long will it take for us to reach there on foot?\" After coming this far, Austin wasn't thinking of backing off.\nSebastian took out a map, and pointed at a mark, \"This is the first checkpoint so we might be here\nhere, around half a day away from the port.\"\nAustin nodded; they can travel that much on foot. The main problem was the checkpoints.\nCrossing them would be a hard part.\nNot only one but there were three checkpoints, each one of them was connected through an artifact that allowed long-distance communication.\nIf they attack the checkpoint, which would be foolish given all those soldiers are highly trained and well-experienced, then the other two checkpoints would get notified of the danger, too.\nAnd going straight through by revealing their identity was a total no-go. They would land not on the Vessel but inside the interrogation cell of the HQ.\n\"It's too risky...\" Austin muttered with a sigh as he calculated all the possible routes.\nValerie's shoulders lost their strength...it was her who suggested this idea, without thinking things through, and now, they have already wasted half a day, only to meet a dead end.\nWhen every hope seemed to have dimmed, Sebastian suddenly voiced,\n\"I might have a way.\" The older one suddenly took out a stamp from his pocket, which Austin instantly identified.\n\"Isn't that...\"\nSebastian smiled at the young man, \"Please never inform your father of this, young master.\"\nValerie and Austin eagerly saw Sebastian writing something on the parchment, and soon their face lit up with a smile.\n....\nIt was yet another day for the soldiers to be standing in attention all the time, in the middle of nowhere.\nThese soldiers were picked from their posts from all over the world for this job.\nThey used to work for different nations and at various corners of the world, when suddenly, their strength and skills were identified, and they were called by the Union council...only to be handed a job as a watchdog.\nWell, the pay is good.\n\"Senior...do you think I will get two days of leave? My wife is pregnant.\"\nThe said senior side-glanced at the soldier before saying, \"You remain around the checkpost for most of the time all year around...when did you get your wife pregnant?\"\nThe junior scoffed, \"You need just one night to plant the seed. Well, you are unmarried-\"\nThe glare from the senior was enough to tell the junior that his request for leave had already been denied.\nThey returned to their positions, and were standing in silence...until, \"Someone is coming.\" The soldier on the left notified before the senior officer noticed that indeed, a man on a horse was advancing in their direction.\nBound by the saddle was a rope that was tied around two individuals who walked behind the horse. Their faces were covered with a black cloth but the man on the horse was identifiable.\n\"Sebastian?\" The chief of the unit knew the butler, as he called out, \"What are you doing here?\"\nSebastian got down from the horse before extending his hand, \"Long time, Sir Drek.\" Sebastian knew the man since he once served Eryndor as the Commander of the Imperial Legion.\nSebastian then took out a parchment and said, \"You must have heard about the recent attacks on Eryndor, I suppose?\"\nDrek was aware of the conflict between Drenovar and Eryndor, so he slowly nodded and took the parchment\nThere was an official seal of Eryndor on the letter that stated that these two prisoners had been caught recently, causing mayhem in the capital, and even tried to assassinate the king.\n\"The King was attacked?\" Naturally, he, who once worked for the King, would feel a little agitated upon hearing that someone dared to slaughter the man he once served.\nSebastian nodded, \"Thankfully, I was in the capital at that time so I handled the situation.\" His voice sounded weak and the man seemed emotional.\nDrek heaved a sigh, and patted Sebastian's shoulder, \"You are a great man, Sebas. Despite the offer from the Council...you kept your loyalty. And even until this age, you are serving the throne in every way possible. I respect you, man.\"\nSebastian lowered his head slightly, \"Your words are wasted on me. It's you all whom I respect. Away from your families, standing here in the wild, day and night.\"\nThe soldiers straightened a little, their chests swelling in pride.\nDrek gave a short laugh, as he handed the paper back to Sebastian and said, \"We both have our difficulties. While we tolerate the harsh weather here, you have to tolerate the tantrums of that snorty brat.\"\nVery slightly, the person behind the horse flinched.\n'No, Valerie...don't react ..' All Austin could pray right now was that the soldier shut his mouth or Valerie might not be able to retain her silence.\nSebastian didn't say anything about that and just kept up a smile as he folded the parchment and asked, \"So, can I take them to the Council headquarters?\" It was mentioned in the letter that the two assassins needed to be interrogated using the lie detection artifact they had in the headquarters.\nDrek nodded, \"Yes, of course. And, take this.\" Drek suddenly pulled out a small red badge, before saying, \"This will help you with the other two check posts.\" With an annoyed expression, he added, \"Those people annoy the hell out of someone with hundreds of questions. This badge will let them know that it is an emergency. And once you reach the headquarters, hand it to someone from the security wing.\"\nSebastian gladly accepted the easy access before he returned to the horse and climbed on it.\n\"See you around, Sir Drek.\"\n\"Take care.\" He gestured towards the soldiers before the barricades were parted, giving him space to pass.\nAnd with that, they crossed all three checkposts and reached the most secured city of the human side by night.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you all liked the chapter.

      "content": "Chapter 98: Chapter 97- Reached\nThey had no problem reaching the port city because of the badge that Captain Drek gave back on the first checkpost.\nAlthough Valerie wanted to go back and ask a few questions from Drek, Austin somehow soothed her anger and brought her along.\n\"So this is the most secure city, humanity could offer.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh as he walked through the city streets while casually glancing around.\nUnlike Eryndor, which has a proper medieval feeling, with regular shops, kids playing around, merchants bringing their products, and blacksmithing shops here and there. This place was much more calm and well-maintained.\nHe could see the soldiers of the Union Council patrolling around. The air smelled of salt and fresh sea breeze, mixing with the faint scent of baked bread from nearby stalls. The city was alive but orderly—guards in polished armor patrolled with calm expressions, their presence enough to keep trouble at bay.\nHere, one could not buy a residence unless there was an emergency in their kingdom or they were a war refugee.\nPeople dream of living in this city for several reasons. This city has the lowest crime rate, and businessmen and merchants don't have to pay import taxes. Those who serve the Union Council get a hefty sum as compensation. And many more benefits\nHowever, despite how rich or powerful you are, the rules of the Council are absolute.\nHow Valerie and Austin were roaming around so freely? Well, earlier Sebastian changed their appearance by using a potion that completely changed their hair color, making both of them black-haired. The duo wore casual clothes, consisting of checkered pants and a plain shirt to not stand out.\nAnd thankfully, they aren't standing out at all.\n\"This place looks...tense for some unknown reason,\" Valerie commented as she saw that even the kids walking around didn't have smiles on their faces and were silently walking back to their houses.\n\"Given the circumstances under which they must have been brought here, I am not surprised,\" Sebastian spoke. He has seen a few wars during his prime time, and the consequences the innocent people had to pay because of conflict between two people.\n\"The Council provides them schooling and appropriate environment so they can get over their trauma,\" Austin spoke as he also spotted a few kids who behaved unnaturally.\nValerie felt troubled about all this, wishing that no other kid had to live in this place under any circumstances.\nThey soon crossed the city streets and reached the headquarters of the Union Council.\nA massive structure built from smooth, dark stone that radiated authority. Unlike the decorative palaces of kings or the grand temples of old, this building had no unnecessary embellishments—every inch of its design was practical, built for function rather than shown.\nTowering columns lined the entrance, supporting a vast archway where the insignia of the Union Council was carved in intricate detail. The flag of the Council hung high above, its dark blue fabric rippling in the ocean breeze.\nSeveral soldiers were walking in and out of the building. Several carriages were parked nearby and several staff members were cleaning around the place, given it was early in the morning.\n\"You two wait here; I will go and drop it.\"\nAustin nodded before he invited Valerie to sit on the nearby resting bench.\n\"The backbone of our side,\" Valerie muttered under her breath as she saw the flag of the Council.\nBeyond the ocean was the land of the demons. The place was a nightmare for many.\nValerie had heard several things about the Demonic lands and had heard that humans had ventured into those lands in the past. Most of the time, they didn't return, since even the air of that domain is toxic.\n\"Whose statue is that...\" Austin wondered aloud as he saw a huge statue planted in the central plaza of the building.\n\"The Great Hero Kane. The one who fought the Demon Lord, a thousand years ago and sealed the calamity.\"\nAustin raised his brows ..so he is the ancestor of Rhea eh? The only one who came nearly close to killing the Demon King at that time when the Demon King was at its peak strength.\nThe demon lord Rhea is supposed to face would be a fragment of its true self. Yet the protagonist couldn't reach the level where she could defeat the being.\n'This time around, Valerie would be at least from the human side...' Valerie was the third strongest being near the end of the story and was defeated through deceit. And the strongest General of the Demon Army also required quite some trickery and a few sacrifices.\nHowever, this time around, Austin has messed up with a few things, and knowing that the Demon Lord would threaten the whole of humanity, there was not a single chance he would stay back and watch everyone fight.\n\"It's strange, no?\" While Austin was distracted by his thoughts about the future, Valerie was still watching the statue as she muttered, \"There were numerous heroes who sacrificed their lives; some of them even became the pillar of humanity while the Hero couldn't fight. However, history only remembered the great hero Kane.\"\nAustin gave a short laugh, \"Well, it all matters about who has a pretty face and who wields a fancy sword. That person naturally becomes a Hero in everyone's eyes.\"\nIt was nothing new. Luke has read many novels where only the protagonists get praised for their brilliance during the final battle, and all the side characters' sacrifice and hard work get outshined.\nValerie smiled. Resting her face on her hand, she gazed at Austin with a warm look before muttering, \"Well, in my eyes, the one who wields a dagger is my hero, though.\"\n\"•⁠﹏⁠•\" Austin averted his gaze shyly. Why is Valerie in such a dangerous mood today?\n\"Young Master,\" Soon Sebastian arrived, and Austin immediately got up.\n\"W-What happened? Is everything alright?\"\nSebastian was surprised to see his master being flustered, but he informed, \"I returned the badge without showing my face and have already talked to the captain of an available vessel.\"\nAustin nodded, \"That's good. We should leave as soon as we can.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Valerie can be dangerous, eh.",

It's quite a bad trait for someone aiming to become a knight in the future to have such a messed up routine.\nShe finished her meal as soon as she could and ran to the indoor gymnasium.\nHer match was tomorrow, but she wanted to watch a few matches before going to training.\n'Rudolph must be waiting...' She and Rudolph had decided to watch the matches together and share what they learned from the battles.\nShe has told him that she would come early in the morning for a spar, before the trials. However...\nAs soon as she entered the gymnasium, she was assaulted by the loud noises of the students, cheering and hooting.\nShe went towards the seat where she sat with Rudolph, thinking that he must have kept a seat for herself.\n....however, Rudolph wasn't there.\nRhea looked around, just in case he forgot where they sat. But he was nowhere to be seen.\n\"Hey, Carter, did you see Rudolph?!\" She had to shout since the place was too loud.\nThe said boy shook his head, \"Nope! He didn't come I guess!\" Saying so, he turned back towards the arena and began shouting.\nRhea frowned; he didn't come? Under normal circumstances, such a battle junkie couldn't miss the selection trials.\n'Something is wrong...' With those thoughts, Rhea exited the venue and headed towards the boy's dormitory\nShe could ask the warden to check on Rudolph if he was sick.\nHowever, just as she was about to enter the dorm,\n*Dhak*\n\"Ah!\"\nRhea crashed into someone even when there was no one standing there.\nThe other one fell on the floor, and he began to appear out of nothing.\nRhea frowned upon seeing the man who definitely was using a skill to hide himself, and looking at his uniform it was clear that he was not from the Academy.\n\"Who the hell are you?\" The pink head asked.\nThe man panicked and tried to run away\nRhea grinned, as she summoned her bow, and while taking the aim, she murmured, \"Great training dummy.\"\n---------**---------\nA Heat Vessel was a boat in which the steam of coal was used along with a monster core to light up the furnace and push the boar at a rapid pace.\nThe boat featured several small cabins where passengers could rest during the journey. A compact kitchen was also available, though travelers had to bring their own ingredients if they wished to prepare meals.\nIt was quite spacious in the room, with two beds, one cupboard, one table, and a small kitchen on the side.\nThe total amount needed to rent the boat, along with the ship captain's fees, amounted to fifty gold coins.\nIt was enough to rent a big house for three months in the Capital and for a peasant to afford luxurious food for a year.\nValerie had saved a hundred gold coins, which she offered completely to Austin. However, the blond Prince returned the rest after using fifty gold to rent the boat.\nNow, Sebastian was outside with the Captain, smoking something unhealthy and talking about the local history of places the Captain had visited in the past.\nSebastian told the two teenagers to rest inside since the journey would take the whole day and they would probably reach Drenovar by the middle of the night.\n\"Are you feeling fine?\" Austin asked as he softly rubbed Valerie's back after she was done vomiting whatever she ate for breakfast\nIt turned out, she doesn't like the ocean much. Motion sickness caught her not long after the boat began sailing.\n\"I...would be fine now. I just have to avoid looking outside.\" She spoke through her hoarse throat.\nShe has shown a very ugly side to her Lord, that's why she couldn't even raise her eyes to look at him.\nAustin heaved a sigh before he went towards the kitchen, took off the small container from the boiler, and poured the warm water into a cup before squeezing lemon juice into the water.\nHe brought the cup to Valerie before telling her, \"Take light sips. You will feel good.\"\nValerie thanked him before taking the cup.\nAustin sat on the other bed while facing Valerie, and he said, \"After drinking it, try to sleep. Once you get up, we will be already there.\"\nValerie nodded, \"I will try...but I don't think I can...\" Just the slight sensation of moving around made her stomach churn, and her head began to throb. If she focuses on it even just for a few seconds she might again ...\n\"Okay, let me help you with that.\" Austin got up, and since she had already taken a few sips of the drink, he rested the cup on the bedside table before telling her.\n\"Lay down,\" Valerie was taken aback, but she didn't question him and obediently laid down before Austin climbed onto the bed and laid down on the other side.\nCollecting Valerie in his arms, he pressed her head against his chest and softly began running his hand up and down her back.\nGenerally, this position would have made her a blushing mess. Being this close to Austin was like asking her to faint right away.\nHowever, at the moment, his warmth and peaceful heartbeat were making her aching mind and body calm. She continued to listen to his heartbeat and clung to him as much as she could.\n\"Just don't think about anything and sleep.\" Austin softly mumbled as he moved the blanket over her and covered themselves completely.\nAnd it worked. Valerie was feeling much better, here in the dark space inside the blanket and pressed against the only person whom she could blindly trust.\nIn his arms, she was safe...felt like, nothing in the world could harm her anymore.\nAustin wordlessly continued to pat her back and not so long after, he sensed her breathing turning calm.\nAustin remained by Valerie's side for quite some time, before he asked the system, 'Can I enter the dungeon without moving from my spot?'\nHe already had a full night's rest, and he had several hours before he reached Drenovar. That's why Austin was thinking of visiting the dungeon and earning a few points, in case he needs to increase his stats during his stay at Drenovar.\n[Ding!]\n[You can host. Just think of pulling the illumination towards yourself, and you will be teleported into the dungeon without moving from your spot.]\nAustin glanced down at Valerie before kissing the crown of her head, and mumbling,\n'Wish me luck, love.'\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 100: Chapter 99- Defeated\nIn the middle of the desolate land, between the corpses of several giants, Austin stood.\nHis chest was heaving with long breaths, sweat droplets trickled down his forehead and his back was completely drenched in sweat as he finally finished the first wave of the Giants.\nThe dead bodies of the fallen ones were slowly disintegrating into nothingness as Austin, one after another, decimated his foes and cleared the first stage.\n[Total points: 326]\nAfter defeating thirty giants, he finally gained some decent points. It was all thanks to his change in strategy that helped him defeat them slowly, rather than using a similar technique of killing them with one strike.\nInflicting several shallow damage until they got extremely slow and agitated before delivering the final strike.\nBy far, it has been quite useful since these giants don't actually cooperate among themselves. Often, they end up coming in each other's way or don't help each other out when in need.\nThanks to their brute nature of just attacking their foe straight forward rather than using throwable like those soldiers, back in the first dungeon, Austin didn't have to worry about some unpredictable attacks.\nHowever, now, he was at the stage where he needed to contemplate his next move.\n[Mid-boss: Kautr]\n[Points: 500]\n[Rank: B-]\nAustin exhaled a long sigh as he looked at the twenty-foot-tall Minotaur.\nThe head of a bull and the body of a caveman. The whole body of the beast was covered with dark hair, but that hair didn't hide the strong muscles of the inhumane, which were packed with strength.\nHolding a club in its hand, it waited for Austin to leave the waiting area so it could lunge into action.\nThe red-eyed beast huffed through its big nose, visible air erupting every time it exhaled.\nJust by looking at it, his past self would have decided to retreat. After all, Austin's Shard couldn't stand against monsters with such tough skin.\nHowever, now, he is a well-experienced C-rank, or maybe he has already reached B-; he doesn't know. However, after coming this far and after killing so many mindless giants, Austin knew, he wouldn't get defeated easily by the big guy.\nGlancing at the clock he found he had ten seconds left.\n\"Raijin, Wisp.\" Summoning the two weapons that would be effective against this thick-skinned beast, Austin got prepared.\nThe countdown neared zero.\nAustin took a deep breath, his body ready to move. He had already planned his first attack—no charging in head-on. He would go around, take the Beast by surprise, and strike where it hurt the most.\nBZZZZ\nHis figure blurred as he threw the boomerang and dashed forward, aiming for the Beast's back, however,\nTING!\nA loud, heavy sound rang in his ears. Suddenly, his body froze. A cold shiver crawled up his spine as his vision darkened. All he could see were two glowing red eyes, burning like fire, staring straight into his soul.\n\"W-What the hell…\"\n[Alert!]\n[Your opponent has used the skill 'Blood Lust.']\n[The host is paralyzed!]\nAustin's breath caught in his throat. His body refused to move, his instincts screaming in panic. He hadn't expected the mid-boss to have a skill like this! And why was his resistance so weak?!\nHis heartbeat pounded in his ears as the monster took a step forward. The ground trembled under its weight, each step making his chest tighten. The air grew heavy, crushing down on him like an invisible force.\nThe creature's eyes bore into him, its presence drowning out everything else.\nAnd Austin could do nothing but stand there, trapped in its gaze.\n\"Damn it, I can't go down like this!\"\nAs the Beast's hulking form loomed closer, a desperate idea struck Austin. Without hesitation, he commanded in his mind—\n'Wisp!'\nSLING!\nThe boomerang he had thrown earlier whirled through the air, slicing past the Beast's long ear before curving back toward him.\nAnd then—\n\"Khak!\"\nAustin gasped as Wisp slammed into his stomach, forcing him to stumble back. Pain flared through his gut, but—\n[Ding!]\n[Host has broken free from Blood Lust!]\nHis lips curled into a grin as he saw the monster stop in its tracks, its oppressive aura vanishing with the skill's cancellation.\nWasting no time, Austin let go of Raijin and launched himself forward at full speed. The Beast barely had time to react before he grabbed its thick, scaled tail—\nThen, using the momentum, he flung himself high into the air.\n**CRACKLE**\nAs Austin soared through the air, the world seemed to slow. His body crackled with energy, silver arcs of lightning twisting around him like living serpents.\nThe moment his fingers tightened around Raijin, the axe responded in kind. Thunder roared through the sky as the weapon came alive, its blade glowing with a fierce, electric light. Sparks danced across Austin's arms, wrapping his figure in a storm of power.\nThe Minotaur barely had the time to raise its club, as it met the axe mid-air and then,\n**BOOOOOM**\nA heavy explosion occurred as thunder met sheer strength.\nAustin's body was thrown back, flying in an arc, while the beast only stumbled back, but still standing.\n**THUD**\nAustin landed on the ground, rolled away, and after hitting a boulder, his body finally came to a pause.\nHis clothes were torn from places, and his cheek and arm were bleeding. His hands were severely damaged by that collision.\n\"Khuk!\" Austin coughed and along with spit, he coughed blood in a thick amount.\nHis vision was blurry as he barely remained conscious. The fatigue from fighting the fodder giants was now hitting in. And that previous collision surely had caused internal damage for sure.\nTurning his head, he saw that the Minotaur has not received a single scratch and was advancing in his direction.\n'I guess ...there is no choice ...'\nAs such, Austin, for the first time, failed to defeat a boss in his first attempt.\nPoor him.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- It's not bad that I conclude the battle scene in one chapter, generally, right?

He might have the speed to fool a B-rank, but his strength and endurance weren't enough to continue.\n'My bones are so fragile...' It has become normal for him to feel or hear his bones snapping—and it could never become pleasant for anyone.\n'System...you are useless ...can't tell me what stats should I be improving...just Endurance...fuck you...' He might be in a daze but he meant every word he spoke.\nIt was getting annoying to not be able to track the specific stat. He might end up being the fastest without having the strength, or maybe strong, but just like those giants, he won't be able to track his opponent.\n[The host needs to be patient. Once he ascends to the next stage, the host will have separate stats for every attribute.]\nSo the system says. However, there was still more than half the way left for him to progress. What he would do until then? Just move with the same pace?\n'This is so goddamn annoying...' Without him knowing, the weight of the defeat was pressing on him.\n\"Mm...what happened?\" Valerie suddenly opened her eyes, albeit barely.\nShe looked at his troubled expression...almost like he was angry.\nShe touched his face, and whispered, \"Don't be angry...\" She didn't know what made him annoyed, but she didn't like her Lord having that expression.\nAustin released a sigh, melting in her touch, before he nodded, \"I won't be angry ...\" Drawing the girl closer to himself, Austin nestled in her embrace and closed his eyes.\nThe best source of quelling his frustration was right beside him.\n°°°°°°°\n\"Drenny's in a rough spot, ain't lookin' too good.\"\n(A/N:- Drenny means Drenovar)\nWhile moving the Vessel along with the tides, the Captain spoke up.\nSebastian lifted his eyes from the diary he was writing before looking at the man, \"What do you mean by that?\"\nThe Captain, who earlier introduced himself as Yolt, puffed a huge cloud of smoke from his mouth, before revealing, \"Lots of soldiers been swarmin' Drenny lately. Hell, some even hitched a ride on this tub.\"\nSebastian frowned, \"Why so suddenly? Is there any situation happening in Drenovar?\"\nIt was unusual for the Council to send troops to a country, and in a large quantity no less. Unless ..there is some war-like situation? But isn't Eryndor in the same state? Why didn't they visit Eryndor then?\n\"I don't know nothin'. Just take 'em there, and they don't come back. Last time I stopped for a smoke in Drenny, damn near got thrown in a cell by those tight-ass guards.\"\nSo...they are patrolling around Drenovar quite strictly, huh? Won't that be problematic if they enter the port through the front gates?\n\"It would be a hassle to go through port security. Haah~wish there could have been another route.\" Sebastian threw the bait. Although he knew that the three of them would somehow manage to infiltrate the town, even if there was no other route, there was no harm in trying.\nAnd just as the grey-haired wished,\n\"You got the right man for the job. I know the best spot where those jackasses won't give you no trouble.\"\n°°°°°°°\nAround midnight, Sebastian knocked on the door.\n*Knock*\n\"Yes, come in,\" Austin called out from the other side.\n*Click*\nPushing the wooden door, he was met by a pleasant sight.\nThe lady was sitting on the bed while the gentleman fed her soup.\nValerie's cheeks turned red, but she didn't refuse to accept the offered spoon. Ignoring Sebastian's gaze she sipped the soup her Lord made for her.\n\"Do you want some? I have left some in the pot.\" Austin asked.\nSebastian shook his head, \"I had a sandwich just now. Thank you for asking, sir.\"\nClosing the door, he approached the duo before informing them, \"I have taken the risk of informing the captain that we can't enter the city through the port. So if I find something suspicious, we might need to dive into the water.\"\nAustin frowned, \"Why...did you do that?\"\n\"The security of Drenovar apparently has been increased for some unknown reason. And the Council has been sending their soldiers regularly to Drenovar. We shouldn't risk trying to enter the country through a straight path.\"\nAustin nodded in understanding.\nFor the Council to send troops...means either some emergency situation has come up or they have taken a step to stop the possible war.\nAustin believes the latter to be a too-good-to-be-true kind of situation. Which meant that there was some unwanted situation that might have arisen in the country.\n'I hope this chaos helps us to reach the main fort, rather than becoming an obstacle...'\nHundreds of uncertain factors and each one of them could change their plans for the worse or better.\nFeeling the warmth of Valerie's skin, Austin raised his eyes and found the girl looking at him with an assuring look, \"Everything will be fine. Even God helps those with good intentions.\"\nAustin smiled, as with a nod he said, \"I hope you are right.\"\n....\nAfter waiting for another thirty minutes, the Captain yelled from the outside, \"Get ready!\"\nSebastian nodded toward the other two before he made his way out of the cabin.\nIf Sebastian gestures, Austin would immediately punch a hole in the wall and jump into the water with Valerie.\nHowever, the moment Sebastian walked back inside, he gave a positive nod, \"You can come.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh of relief before he held Valerie's hand and muttered, \"Let's go.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- They are surrounded by dangers.

      "content": "Chapter 102: Chapter 101- Destination(2)\nDrenovar's main capital was surrounded by water from three sides.\nThe city was built along the shore because, at the time, humanity was locked in war. They needed a base as close to enemy territory as possible to launch quick attacks and defend efficiently. The location gave them a strategic advantage.\nThat's why two headquarters were established, and one of the two was named Drenovar.\nThe military strength of the nation was quite profoundly big, and the soldiers were well-trained and equipped as well.\nFor the Council, Drenovar was both a military stronghold and a source of wealth. In contrast, the Union Council might be willing to sacrifice Eryndor if it came to that. Austin feared this possibility even more after noticing Union Council soldiers moving about.\nHowever, soon, he would realize that the main purpose of their presence here was something entirely different.\n...\nTo reach here, they had to swim for half an hour before they reached the coast and somehow found this motel not so far away from the shore.\nThe receptionist was really nice since he allowed them to first get freshened up before paying for the room.\nAfter taking a bath and changing his clothes in the room they were provided with, Austin went to pay for the room and food.\n\"It's quite busy around the city as well.\" As Austin returned to the room after paying the receptionist, he heard Valerie muttering.\nSebastian was in the other room, changing clothes, that's why Austin didn't lock the door and approached his lover.\n\"Did you hear anyone talking about what has been happening?\" Valerie asked him as she turned to look at him.\nThey noticed that there definitely was something happening in the capital since numerous warriors were moving around, and there were barely any civilians on the streets.\nAustin heaved a sigh before informing her, \"We might have arrived at the wrong time, Val.\"\nHearing that, Valerie's eyes parted slightly, but before she could have asked anything, Austin told her to wait for Sebastian.\nLooking outside the window, Austin looked at the bright palace in the distance and felt that it was looking quite far even though he could reach it in a few minutes.\nThe current situation was quite complicated.\n*Knock*\nHearing the knock, Austin said, \"Come in.\"\nFrom the other side, the familiar grey-haired butler stepped inside; wearing a long, flowing tunic with intricate embroidery along the edges, the fabric light yet durable, perfect for travel.\nHis trousers were loose, gathered at the ankles with leather ties, allowing for ease of movement. A wide sash wrapped around his waist, securing a small pouch and a curved dagger at his side.\n\"Woah ...what's with that outfit?\" Austin sounded amazed and Valerie seemed surprised as well.\nHe didn't look like Sebastian at all.\n\"I will be going to investigate the situation later, so I arranged some native clothing to blend well.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, as he informed him, \"I might have some idea what is happening around the place.\"\nAustin gestured for the man to close the door before he sat down on the chair.\nSebastian also approached the duo and stood before his master, \"What's the matter, sir?\"\nAustin told them, \"Do you know what a Hellstain is?\"\nSebastian's brows drew closer, while Valerie seemed slightly unsure, as she asked, \"Is it related to the great war?\"\nAustin explained to her, \"The war between the Heroes and the Demon Lord spread across both realms, shaking the land and sky. Blood flowed on both sides, turning the battlefields red. But the Demon Lord's blood was no ordinary blood—it was cursed. Wherever it touched the ground, it did not fade. It sank deep, leaving dark marks that never disappeared. Even after a thousand years, those stains still remain.\"\nHeaving a sigh, he added, \"And whenever chaos rises near those stains, demons begin spilling out of them—until the stain fades.\"\nLooking out of the window, Austin added, \"And recently, one of the stains has awakened in the capital because of growing chaos.\"\nThey were preparing for the war that's why thousands of soldiers had gathered in Drenovar. And because of that, the Hellstain awakened.\nAustin never anticipated it since canonically, this and several other Hellstains only awakened when the Demon Lord returned.\nHowever, he forgot that the plot had shifted, and he couldn't keep any possibility out of the game.\n\"How many days does it generally take for a Stain to fade?\" Valerie asked a tinge of anxiety in her voice.\nThey don't have much time left, and entering the palace under these circumstances would be quite difficult and risky.\n\"Generally it takes about fifteen days...based on a country's military strength. However, Drenovar had to ask for the Union's help, which means....the Hellstain is pretty grave.\" Sebastian spoke without thinking too deeply about it. It was all just a guess, and considering the situation, it seems to be true.\nSilence descended in the room after that as Austin kept looking outside.\nSebastian, after a minute of silence, asked, \"What do you think, young master? What should be our next move?\"\nAustin took a deep breath before relaying his decision, \"We need to divide into two teams—one would go and check on the situation around the palace. And Sebastian, you would be best for the job. And in the meantime, Valerie and I would go and see the situation at the Hellstain.\"\nSebastian objected, \"It would be too risky, sir.\"\nAustin agreed, \"I know but coming here was already too big of a risk. We can't hesitate now, Sebas.\"\nValerie also said, \"We need to measure all the factors before taking any step, Sebastian. And not like we would fight the demons after going there.\"\nThe older one exhaled an audible breath, \"You are right; I might be overthinking a little.\" He couldn't consider these two as regular teenagers.\nThe lady was one of the strongest warriors in the world, and the young master was quite a wise and proactive person Sebastian had ever met.\n\"Okay then, let's have dinner and then go to our respective destination. It's quite a long night ahead waiting for us.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you all are enjoying the story so far. Drop a comment.",

The houses here were mostly two or three storeys, and their condition was quite good as well.\nAustin has heard that even an average earning person could afford a house in the town, however, there was one condition—at least one of their family members must be working for the capital.\nThen, the least populated and the most silent section of the Capital, where the nobles reside.\nThe houses here were more like villas, situated at random spots, unlike the houses for commoners which were lined up on either side of the street\nThe houses of nobles are situated according to their desire, and later routes are paved to reach the mansion.\nIt is usually the silent and posh area of the Capital, however, it was currently under the shades of chaos.\nReason? Hellstain.\nIn the middle of the noble's district was where most of the soldiers gathered.\nThe red glaring mark that appeared a few days ago has been spewing savage demons one after another.\n\"It looks like it's pulsating...\" Valerie murmured as they stood at the top of the nearby house and surveilled the situation.\nIt was a dark long mark, trailing down from one of the villa's middle, and spreading into several roots after reaching the ground.\nThe Hellstain gave the sensation of being alive, with its shade brightening up like a beating heart, and then the illumination dimming a little.\nThere were numerous soldiers from the Drenovar side, some were barricading the area.\nSome were on the other side of the barricade; fighting the demons that appeared once in a while.\n\"They can't send a huge force at once...\" Austin muttered, \"The blood of the Demon Lord affects the soldiers, corrupting their minds and making them insane.\"\nValerie added, \"That explains why they have put so many soldiers behind the barricade. But does being near the demons affect them?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"If one gets scratched from them or consumes their blood, then yeah, something disastrous would take place.\"\nThey can't even risk launching a long-range attack and destroying the stain since that would scatter the blood, and the whole capital might get affected because of that.\n\"Here comes another,\" Valerie voiced as she saw a gruesome figure emerging from the stain, changing its form and rising from the darkness.\nThe demon was unlike the one they faced back in the academy. Those demons had sanity and could talk like humans.\nHowever, these demons were pure savages.\nThey moved on to their instincts of hunting humans. Like the one they were witnessing right now, charged toward the nearest soldier even though it had yet to completely get out of its cocoon of blood.\nAustin saw the soldier jumping back in panic and shooting an arrow toward the demon—\n**BOOOOM**\nThe arrow stabbed the demon and exploded—must be an effect of the Shard—which caused the blood of the demon soldier to scatter.\n\"Gaaaaaahh!\"\n\"You idiot!\"\n\"Shit! It-aghhhhhh!\"\nThe nearby soldiers had to protect themselves from the scattered blood, but some of them were caught in it, resulting in severe burns on their armor and skin.\n\"They are....amateur...\" Valerie muttered in disappointment, seeing a soldier panicking in the face of threat and taking down his comrades too.\nAustin heaved a sigh; the pace of the demon was too high, and the soldiers did what was ingrained in their instincts: use their Shard.\nHowever, as Valerie uttered, that was a foolish decision.\n\"And the worst part....the demon is still alive.\" Austin sighed, as he saw the destroyed upper body of the demon was regaining the form by absorbing more blood from the stain.\nIt was completely a horror sight to witness. The demon was nothing but blood—shifting, writhing, pulsing like a living wound. Its form never stayed still, twisting and stretching as if it was barely holding itself together.\nThick, dark-red liquid dripped from its body, pooling beneath it, yet it never seemed to run dry.\n\"Why are the council members here when they aren't even trying to help?\"\nValerie questioned; she had spotted numerous council members earlier when they were advancing toward the stain.\nHowever, around the site, there were no council members that could be seen.\n\"If my knowledge serves right, then I think near the end of this whole chaos, a huge beast of high ranking is spewed out of the Stain—and defeating that would mean getting rid of the stain.\"\nAustin remembers that when the Demon Lord returned, all the Stains came alive, spilling hundreds of demons and demon bosses at once and throwing the human domain into chaos.\nHowever, since humanity isn't in a state of war, this situation would be handled much more calmly.\n\"So, Val. Tell me what we should do?\" Austin asked as he sat down on the nearby chair.\nValerie felt nervous...was this a test?\nAfter she carefully considered the situation, she decided, \"We should infiltrate the palace before the last demon arrives.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"But won't we risk exposing ourselves to the council members who are around the palace?\"\n\"But we don't have that much time either. As Sebastian said, this could take over a month.\"\nAustin hummed, with his head moving in assent.\nValerie thought for a moment before adding, \"And there is a high chance that the Council members would defeat the last one right away; not leaving us with enough time to reach our goal.\"\nAustin moved his head slightly from left to right.\"That is correct. Let's discuss it with Sebastian and make a plan.\"\nBefore Austin could have jumped off the building, Valerie hurriedly asked, \"Did I pass the test?\"\nAustin was taken aback, as he turned to look at the girl and found her looking at him in anxiety.\n'It can't be ...so she was thinking that I was testing her?' Austin barely controlled himself from chuckling.\nSeeing that expectant gaze, he couldn't help but softly caress the girl's head and say, \"Yes, you passed.\"\n\"Eheh~\" Valerie closed her eyes and enjoyed the touch.\nShe was helpful to her lord~So happy~\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I mean...she is like that.

      "content": "Chapter 104: Chapter 103- Medic\n[A few hours ago]\n[Valorian Academy]\n\"Why do you always come across such strange entities?\" Rudolph couldn't help but ask as he saw the man who was bound by the ropes and was currently lying inside his room.\nRudolph had to return to his room since he forgot something and when he stepped out of the dormitory, he saw Rhea chasing someone with her cross-bow in her hand.\nNaturally, he followed his instincts and helped catch the man who was quite agile and strong.\nAfter knocking him out and bringing him to the room, Rudolph heard from Rhea that the man was snooping around the boys' dormitory.\n\"Can't be helped. I am blessed by lady luck~\" Rhea grinned. It wasn't the first time she bumped into a being who uses invisibility.\n\"He ran away after seeing you, and doesn't belong to the academy....okay, he is a criminal,\" Rudolph said as he approached the man and knelt before him.\n\"What are you doing?\" Rhea asked as she saw him putting his hands on the criminal's shroud.\n\"Trying to find which Lord he serves.\"\nRudolph tore the black shroud of the man. He knew that this couldn't be a passerby or a robber who was trying to steal something. The technique he showed while escaping couldn't belong to a thug.\n*Tear*\nPulling away the shroud, he searched his collar and back of the neck before his eyes landed on his arm—and Rudolph froze.\n\"Isn't that....\" Rhea muttered, her brows tensing in a frown.\nIt was the insignia of Eryndor that they saw on the man's arm.\nRudolph's brows were creased as well—a soldier from Eryndor in the academy and was trying to keep himself hidden?\nWas it someone who knew Austin? No, his relationship with the capital wasn't that good to keep a few soldiers nearby. And why would he need a soldier to spy around when Austin himself was in the capital?\nAnd as much as Rudolph has observed the guy recently, other than Valerie and Sebastian Austin wouldn't trust anyone.\nThen....a spy? But who sent him? Was he here to just gain some information on someone? Or was he supposed to cause harm?\n\"We have to take him for interrogation,\" Rudolph said, which surprised Rhea,\n\"But who will help us?\" They were two students who captured a man under assumptions. People would surely question them first.\nRudolph, with a grin, got up and said, \"Our dear vice-headmaster. Did you forget his specialty?\"\nRhea couldn't. The ex-hunter was infamous for his interrogation skills. People say that those who went inside his special cell for interrogation either spilled everything starting from their birth or died mid-way because of fear.\nRhea was unsure if they could get help from the vice-headmaster. However, since Rudolph seemed certain, she didn't question him.\n\"But before that,\" Rudolph added, \"We need to take care of the L-pill.\"\nRhea tilted her head, \"L-pill? What's that?\"\nRudolph was amazed, \"Someone aiming to become a warrior, doesn't know about the L-pill?\"\nSeeing the confusion on her face, he told her, \"It's a way for a soldier to end their lives before they can get interrogated. In some countries, the soldiers are bound by spells, some by artifacts, but in Eryndor, they use the L-pill, or, the lethal pill.\"\nRhea now realized what he was talking about, \"Quite smart of you...\" To not let the soldier kill himself right after waking up, he would remove the mechanism altogether.\n\"But do you know where that pill is?\" She asked.\nRudolph nodded, \"I do know but I can't tell you, so face away.\"\nRhea pouted, \"I won't tell anyone so lemme see.\"\nRudolph chuckled, \"Can't grant you this wish, Princess, since I promised my father, who told me about it, to never reveal our military's secrets to anyone. Not even you, Rhea.\"\nIn the end, the pinkhead had to face away.\n°°°°°\n[Next morning]\n[Drenovar]\nSebastian returned after his inspection and the group of three reunited at the motel they were staying at.\nIt was early in the morning, so Valerie was still slightly sleepy.\nAustin didn't mind her sleeping since he could have told her later what Sebastian got. However, she insisted on listening to it.\n\"The security around the palace is quite strict. Three layers of security and there is a high chance for the Council Members to be living in the palace at the moment.\"\nWith a frown, Austin asked, \"Did you see them?\"\nSebastian nodded, \"A few of them went inside wearing their uniform but came out wearing casual clothes sometimes around the dawn. They seemed to have gotten comfortable here.\"\nGiven how long they might have to stay it was not surprising that the council officers were letting loose a little.\nAustin crossed his arms, and thought for a moment; three layers of security were something he expected from the most important place in the whole country. However, these council members can cause unnecessary trouble for them.\n\"I have another piece of news, sir.\" Sebastian began, \"I noticed a certain man going in and out of the palace more than twice. When he went in for the first time, he had a bag, but then he came out not so long after, returned home then went back. And the next time he walked out, he was carrying his bag again.\"\nFollowing that, \"He lives in the second district, and after investigating a little, it seems he is the medic treating the former king.\"\nAustin raised his brows; that's quite an information.\nRichard knew that the former king was suffering gravely from an incurable illness. Although he wouldn't die immediately, since Rhea treats him later in the story, he still remains in a lot of pain.\nSo it's not surprising for a medic to regularly treat him, to help him tolerate the pain.\n'This might work...' Turning his eyes toward Sebastian, Austin spoke,\n\"You go and rest. I will keep an eye on him.\"\nSebastian wanted to say something when suddenly Valerie jumped in, \"I will also come.\"\nAustin shook his head, \"No, Val. You need to go and keep an eye on the Stain. If you find the last demon appearing you need to inform us immediately.\"\nValerie was slightly nervous about this arrangement, but considering the severity of the matter, she didn't insist, \"Okay, I will go.\"\nSebastian soon added, \"Be careful, young master. The medic always remains surrounded by soldiers.\"\nAustin nodded, \"I don't plan on approaching him. Just need to make sure a few things.\"\nWith that, the three of them went their respective ways.\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Leave a comment.",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Chapter 104- Unexpected encounter\nAustin was at the top of one of the buildings in the middle-town—keeping an eye on the house where the medic lives.\nHis plan was to take advantage of his regular visit to the palace and replace him as the medic by using the mask of disguise.\nOnce he was inside the palace, he could meet the former king in person and help him with his illness. And in exchange, he would ask for peace between Eryndor and Drenovar.\nThe reason they targeted Eryndor in the first place was because of their ancestors being killed during their visit to Eryndor.\nAnd if they could become angered at the death of their deceased relatives, they surely would get appeased if Austin saved one of their living relatives.\nOr so he hopes. However, if it doesn't happen and Austin finds himself being cornered then he has two routes in mind to escape. One of the two might put Valerie in danger that's why he was thinking of using the second method.\n\"The old man generally doesn't leave the house, huh?\" It was quite sunny today, that's why Austin was feeling a little bothered sitting here in the open. However, there was no better spot where he wouldn't get caught and could keep a close watch on the house.\n'I hope this improves my endurance...' With those thoughts, he got up from his seat and began looking around casually\nThe market of Drenovar was not so populated because foreigners are being banned from entering the capital as of now. The reason was obvious.\nAnd the native citizens were also staying indoors unless there was a necessity or an emergency.\n'Compared to yesterday, fewer soldiers are patrolling around....' Maybe because of the increasing demons, or they were sent away to some other posts, the number of soldiers was a lot less on the streets.\nOr maybe they increase the numbers at night? Who knows—\n'Huh?' Austin's eyes suddenly landed on a single figure running through alleys, while crying and shouting for help.\n'Is that a demon?' There was a being chasing behind her, wearing tattered clothes that seemed to belong to the military.\nA cursed one? But how did it escape?\nAustin looked around to see if there was any officer nearby, however, the girl kept running deeper into alleys, where most of the houses were either closed or abandoned. There was no patrolling officer nearby and the demon was closing in passing each second.\nAustin glanced at the house of the medic—it was still locked, which allowed the blond Prince to make the decision.\nSummoning his Shard, Austin pushed off the rooftop, soaring through the air before landing effortlessly on the building across the street. His body felt lighter than ever—leaping over rooftops was no longer a challenge, just instinct.\nHis eyes locked onto the girl. The demon was nearly upon her.\nWithout hesitation, Austin dashed forward at blinding speed. At the last second, he twisted mid-air, his movements sharp and fluid, and sent his Shard hurtling toward the creature.\nSHLINK!\nThe icy-blue dagger sliced through the air like a ghost, its form nearly invisible. The demon's claw was inches from the girl's throat—\nSQUELCH!\n\"KHWAK!\"\nThe monster choked, its body jerking as the blade buried deep in its back, piercing clean through its chest.\nThe girl was trembling all over as she fell on the ground ...and inches away from her face was the dagger that saved her life.\n*Thud*\nAustin landed on the ground and told her, \"It isn't dead, so move away.\"\nThe solemn voice of her savior was followed as she moved away from the demon to the best of her abilities.\nAustin pulled away his dagger by summoning it back in his hand as he saw the gaping hole in the demon healing at an astonishing pace.\n\"*KHRUEGH*\" The demon slowly turned towards Austin, its red eyes holding the sheer lust for murder.\nAustin could tell that the Demon was weak because it failed to chase after a child, and even failed to respond to that attack.\n\"I heard you all are weak to the sun?\" Austin asked as he twirled his dagger on his palm.\nThe reason why the demon was in an alley is because sunlight doesn't reach there....and that explains why the soldiers weren't as strict as they were during the night.\nAustin took a step forward, his grip tightening around his Shard. The demon growled, its breath ragged, but it didn't charge—it was hesitant.\nSmart. But not smart enough.\n\"Come on,\" Austin taunted, tilting his head. \"I don't have all day.\"\nThe demon lunged, claws swiping for his throat. But before it could even reach him—\nSLASH!\nAustin blurred past it, his dagger carving through flesh like paper. A deep gash split its side open, black blood spraying onto the walls.\nThe demon howled, stumbling.\nAustin didn't stop. He dashed in again—\nSLICE!\nAn arm went flying.\nSCHLICK!\nA leg followed. The creature crumbled to the ground, gurgling, trying to crawl away, but Austin was already stepping on its back, forcing it down.\n\"KHRUUGH—\"\nSHLINK!\nThe icy-blue dagger flashed once, then sank into the demon's neck.\nA sickening crack—then silence.\nThe body twitched for a moment, then went still, black blood pooling beneath it.\nAustin exhaled, flicking the dark liquid off his dagger before summoning it back into his palm.\nAustin heaved a disappointed sigh...even though it was not under the sun directly, the presence of the sun did affect its endurance.\n'It would be great if I could bring the Demon Lord under the sun as well ...'\n\"Umm...\" Hearing the hesitant voice, Austin turned toward the little girl, thinking of telling her to go find her family—when suddenly his eyes widened.\nThe little girl slowly grew bigger; her black hair took a light blue shade as she stood before him with her hands in front of her.\n\"Thank you for saving me, my savior.\"\nAustin wasn't able to respond. No, it wasn't because she was beautiful, since only one beauty can make him freeze like this.\nThe real reason behind his shock was the identity of the person...\n'Isn't she the Princess of Drenovar?'\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 106: Chapter 105- Tough choice\n[Capital of Eryndor]\nAiden was in his room, looking at the large clipboard in front of him.\nOn the board, there were several names: Valerie, Austin, Eryndor, Council, and Hener.\nHis plans were simple: first, resolve the situation with Drenovar using Hener's help, and while he does so, he would get rid of Austin. And then using his influence, he would somehow get close to Valerie—a person who would become an influential figure in the future with her connection with the Council.\nThrough Valerie, Aiden would build connections with the Council, and with Hener, Aiden was planning on starting a very profitable business to boost Eryndor's vaults.\nHis plans were all set and he had already arranged people who would be useful in his venture.\nHowever, his impulsive decision of poisoning the king and failing at it, increased difficulty. Although Hener helped him by throwing the bait of disowning Austin, the sick king has yet to make up his mind.\n'I can't let the pieces fall from their standings. I need to make sure that Austin dies before Drenovar loses its cool.' Thankfully, Drenovar was currently suffering from a Hellstain, so it was highly unlikely they would be attacking anytime soon.\nAmidst all this, Aiden has somehow lost Austin's track. The foolish kid who was easy to provoke has been showing some dangerous traits.\nNot caring about his mother, having a secret chat with the King, and the most annoying thing, his closeness with Valerie.\n'That damn woman can be a big obstacle in my path...' S-rank warriors cannot be taken lightly. They are powerhouses who can go against an army, and come out victorious as well. Although Valerie doesn't have much experience, she still has the attention of the Council, and individually, she is on a whole different level.\nHer recent closeness to Austin would make things difficult. Even during Austin's exile, Valerie would surely insist on accompanying him...and if that happens, there was a high chance for Hener to fail to assassinate him.\n'Before that...I need to first get a report of their whereabouts ...' It was the third day since the soldier was sent to the academy. Aiden wanted to make sure that Austin had returned to the Academy rather than wandering around.\n...however, until now, that useless soldier hasn't returned.\n*Knock*\n\"You have a letter, my lord.\" Hearing the words, Aiden approached the door.\nUnlocking the door, he found the familiar maid standing there while holding the letter, \"It was sent through WarpMail.\"\nAiden frowned; someone sent a WarpMail? Considering how costly it is, the soldier shouldn't have sent it, most likely.\nAiden took the letter before closing the door.\nReturning to the table, he sat down and first inspected the letter for any trap or curse.\nAfter careful inspection, he took out a small knife and parted the seal from the envelope.\n\"Hmmm?\" Upon looking inside, he found it was from Morkel.\nAiden sent a letter to Morkel three days ago, asking if Austin had returned. The only reason why Aiden still sent the soldier was because of his lack of trust in that Professor.\n[Your informer,\nThe snooping dog you sent was caught by the Hunter. Possibly died soon after. The playground is being guarded now.\nAbout your beloved swine, I spotted him. Don't worry.]\nAiden narrowed his eyes....that useless soldier was caught? Didn't he have an invisibility skill?\n'The security of the academy has been increased huh?' It was natural that once a spy got caught, they would double the security. More so, when the trials were going on.\n'Well, that helps...' Aiden was originally planning on sending more troops to check on the academy. However, after reading the letter, he decided to not take the risk.\n'Beloved swine...eh.' Aiden chuckled. Fortunately, Austin was back in school. Now, he won't need to worry about his whereabouts and can wait for the old man to make the decision.\n'I guess I was worrying for nothing.' bringing the letter to the candle, he allowed it to burn into ashes.\n°°°°°°°\nSebastian and Valerie were waiting for Austin in the room, and not so long after, the ex-blond walked inside the room.\nSebastian noticed a folded paper in his master's hand, that ushered him to ask, \"What is that, sir?\"\nAustin told him, \"We will get to that eventually.\"\nTurning toward his fiancée, Austin asked, \"Did you notice anything strange at the site?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"Just the amount of demons spawning was less, and the soldiers were handling them easily.\"\nThat was expected. The stain was, not directly, but still under the effect of the sunlight.\nSitting on the chair, Austin said, \"I met a stray demonized soldier while I was observing the medic.\"\nSebastian frowned, \"Did you get attacked, sir?\"\nValerie also looked worried, knowing full well what would happen if someone got damaged by that being.\nHowever, \"No, it wasn't me who was its target—it was a little girl.\" Heaving a sigh and leaning back in his seat, Austin added, \"I, naturally, saved her by defeating the demon without any problem. But the major problem arrived when the girl showed her real face.\"\nValerie gasped, \"Did she backstab you?\" She was already half risen from the bed to check on him.\nHowever, \"No, Valerie...rather, she literally showed her real face by undoing the effect of her Shard and revealing the face of Princess of Drenovar.\"\n\"...!\" Sebastian was stunned while Valerie's eyes widened.\n\"You...ended up saving the Princess and she saw your face?\" Sebastian asked, only to get a nod in return.\n\"I had no clue that a Shard could have such a strange ability...and now, the Princess calls me her savior.\"\nThe expression of shock on Valerie's face was wiped away, and more of a solemn look appeared.\nAustin, for now, ignored her and continued, \"To thank me, she has invited me to the palace tomorrow. She wants to reward me.\"\nSebastian raised his brows, \"That...can actually work, young master. Rather than using any back route, you can enter the palace as a savior. For saving their princess they surely will be in your debt, and if you end up healing the former King, they would practically embrace you and Eryndor with open arms.\"\nThe plan was perfect and more plausible than any of the plans Austin and Sebastian had devised until now.\nHowever, \"I don't want you to go.\" A clear rejection from Valerie.\nHer head was leaning down as she muttered, \"I know I must be sounding unreasonable, but I don't want you to meet them as her savior. I just...don't want to.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh; he knew something like this would happen.\nSebastian understood the situation. Although far-fetched, there was a strong possibility the King of Drenovar would arrange a marriage between the two children to solidify the alliance between their kingdoms.\nAustin voiced, \"I knew you wouldn't agree, that's why I brought this.\"\nAustin revealed what was in the paper finally.\nThe water supply system of Drenovar main castle.\nSebastian's brows grew closer as he read the map, and asked, \"You don't mean to say...that you are going to infiltrate the palace, right sir?\"\n\"We have no other option, Sebas.\" Austin explained, \"I kept an eye on the medic and he always remains surrounded by soldiers. If we want to impersonate the doctor, then we would need its blood and also have to knock him out and keep away from the palace in the meantime. That's too risky.\"\nSebastian pinched the bridge of his nose; he expected that much. However,\n\"The water refinery is about five hundred meters away from the palace, how will you hold your breath for that long? Not to talk about the water pressure might not be with you.\"\nAustin assured him, \"I have recently acquired a skill which will help me. Don't worry about that.\"\nSebastian was taken aback....how could he possibly gain a skill when his Shard hadn't evolved yet?\nFirst that axe and now this...his young master was full of surprises.\nValerie, who has been silent until now, suddenly asked, \"Sebastian..can you leave us alone for some time?\"\nThe grey-haired man raised his brows, before turning towards Austin.\nUpon getting the nod, the man gave a short bow and excused himself. He would probably keep an eye on the Stain in the meantime.\nOnce Sebastian was out of the room, Valerie looked up. There were tears in her eyes, and the emotions Austin could read were definitely guilt,\n\"If you are going to risk your life...then I would rather let you go with her...\" She said those words which, her past self couldn't have believed she did.\nHowever, considering how much risk Austin was about to take, she would rather have him choose the safer path. His life is more important than anything.\nAustin smiled at the foolish girl before telling her, \"You don't need to feel guilty, Val. There is a high chance that just as I identified the Princess, she might have as well. And her inviting me is just a trap.\"\nGetting closer to her, he wrapped his hand around her head before bringing her closer, \"So don't cry, now. You know it hurts me, right?\"\nIn his embrace, she shed tears, while feeling her heart getting heavier.\nWas her love for him...putting him in danger?\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I mean...breaking her character felt I would be not doing justice.

His jet-black hair cascaded past his shoulders, framing a face carved with experience. With his broad, imposing build, he exuded an aura of sheer dominance—one that demanded respect without a word.\nYet now, that fearsome presence was clouded by something rare—concern. His brows knit together, his jaw clenched slightly as he and the others took in the news of the youngest's reckless venture.\nIt wasn't the first time for Sophie to run away from the palace like this, using her Shard. However, the situation was critical at the moment, with the appearance of the Stain.\n\"Sophie, you do know that our palace is about half as big as the town, right? Why don't you run around inside?\" The oldest child of the family, Hazir spoke up. He was currently combing his sister's hair after massaging her head with oil.\n\"I usually don't speak against it, but today, you took an extreme step, princess.\" The first queen—Zahra chided the little one.\nThe lady has flowing red hair that reaches her waist and a pair of bright blue eyes. She was weaving a sweater for her grandchild, who could be born any day now.\nSophie giggled, \"But it was fortunate in a way too, you know, got to meet someone interesting.\" Sophie hugged her legs as she recalled the person who saved her.\nThose sharp eyes, the long flowing hair—the way he gallantly saved her, cutting down the demon with effortless grace. His battle style, the sheer elegance in every movement—it was so mesmerizing that she could still recall each motion with perfect clarity.\nShe was so mesmerized in that moment, that Sophie remained standing at the spot even after he left.\nThe second Prince noticed her sister's gaze...it was the same which a maiden possessed when she,\n\"Is in love,\" Tavrin spoke up, grabbing everyone's attention.\nSophie was jolted out of her reverie as she turned toward her brother.\nTavrin grinned, \"Considering the series of love affairs I have—\" the boy was smacked on his head by his mother, but still continued with a smile, \"—I can tell that my sister is in love.\"\nThe second Queen shook her head, \"Don't listen to his words.\" However,\n\"Is it true, Princess?\" The patriarch of the family narrowed his eyes\nSophie had a profound blush on her face as she retorted, \"He is talking nonsense, father. Don't listen to him.\" Seriously, how can he say something like that in front of Father?!\nThe youngest Prince teasingly added, \"But there definitely is something. You have never shown that expression after coming across a guy. Tell me, do you like him?\"\nSophie couldn't duck any lower to hide her face.\nEach eye of her family member was now on her.\nDoes she like him?\nBut they didn't even share a word...more like he only told her to leave, before dashing away. Does he even know who she was? Would he care? But why would he care when she isn't even sure of her feelings?\nWhile the Princess was dwelling deeper into her thoughts, the people around her—who all have their love tales and experiences—could tell that Sophie definitely had something about the boy.\nSuddenly, the Patriarch got up from his seat—startling Sophie as she thought that he might be angry.\nHowever, just as he was about to turn around and leave, he voiced, \"Bring him before me tomorrow. I will first assess the brat who dares to corrupt my pure daughter.\"\nAs the patriarch left, Sophie glanced at her mother, and after receiving a nod from her, a blooming smile appeared on her face.\n°°°°°°°\n\"So here is the plan,\" Austin began, \"I will go inside the palace through the water pipes and wait for the right moment. If I can get the blood of any servant or family member, I will use the mask of disguise.\"\nWhile showing the wooden mask, he continued, \"I will somehow reach the former king before the time runs out and help him with his illness using the eternal flower extract.\"\nHeaving a sigh, he added, \"I need to make him understand that despite having the opportunity, I didn't kill him but rather saved him. If this works, then good, and if it doesn't...well, you two know what you need to do.\"\nSebastian nodded, \"Form a distraction for you to escape, right?\"\nValerie added, \"And if we fail, you will use the Stopwatch to get out and we will leave immediately.\"\nAustin nodded in agreement, \"That's right. However, it's highly unlikely they would chase me out given their close bonding.\" At some point, it was constantly highlighted in the game that the family was quite close. They can take their lives and sacrifice themselves for each other.\nIf the world was sticking to the game, then saving the former king, who is still quite adored by the current king, would allow Austin to gain the truce.\nTurning towards his lover, Austin relayed, \"Now Valerie, as I have mentioned before you cannot use your Shard here, okay?\"\nThe reason was simple: the members of the Union Council.\nWhen someone gets registered in their directory as a potential member of the Council, they closely study them—so naturally, they must have heard or seen the Shiverfall before.\nThat's why, Austin told Valerie to avoid using her Shard as long as possible.\n\"Understood.\" Valerie gave a firm nod.\n...\nThey didn't stay up for long since they would be initiating their mission early in the morning tomorrow.\nThe water pressure would be with Austin in the morning, and his newly acquired skill, 'Aqua Lungs,' would surely come in handy. Now the problem was his inexperience in swimming in such a compact space. But well, he knew he would somehow overcome the difficulty.\n\"Goodnight, sir.\" Sebastian gave a short bow at the door before making his way towards the room across from the gallery\nThey have rented only two rooms because there were only two rooms available.\nAustin and Valerie had already spent the night together before, but still, whenever Austin closed the door and locked it like that, her heart trembled.\nAustin smiled softly at the girl who was already lying down on the bed with her hands sticking close to her body.\n\"Don't be so stiff, Val.\" Austin spoke as he reached the bed and laid down beside her, \"It's not the first time for us.\"\nValerie covered her face with the blanket, as she watched her Lord from close.\nSoon her cheeks were dyed red as she uttered,\n\"Lights...turn it off.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"Hmm? What's the rush?\"\nWith her gaze drawing down, she uttered in a barely audible voice, \"I...I feel shy seeing you from this close.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"We have been together for so long yet your resistance is so low. Learn from me. Even though my heart is beating so fast being so close to you, I can maintain a calm demeanor.\"\nValerie's raven brows went up slightly as she moved her hand and touched his chest.\n*Ba* *Dum* *Ba* *Dum*\nIndeed...his heart was racing.\nThat means...she wasn't the only one?\nThat makes her happy.\nAustin soon leaned forward before kissing her forehead and whispering, \"Good night.\" Tapping on the table lamp, he allowed the room to be engulfed by darkness.\n°°°°°°\nThe storm raged, thunder cracking like the earth itself was splitting apart. Rain poured in relentless sheets, turning the ocean into a writhing mass of black waves.\nAnd from the depths, they came.\nShadows surged beneath the water, massive shapes twisting and writhing just beneath the surface. Then, the first one broke through—a monstrous octopus, its slimy tentacles wriggling as if tasting the air. Upon its back sat a demon, its flesh pale and slick like something long drowned, hollow eyes glowing with hunger.\nMore followed.\nSerpents as thick as towers, their scales glistening under the lightning. Giant crustaceans with jagged pincers, dragging themselves over the waves. Fanged leviathans, their gaping maws lined with rows of shifting teeth. And on each beast, a rider—horned demons with jagged weapons, their bodies twisted, their grins wide and cruel.\nThey didn't roar. They didn't shriek.\nThey simply advanced, silent but unstoppable, the storm itself bending to their will.\nThe cluster of demons was all heading in a single direction. The presence of the Demon Lord and the human nations would become their new stronghold.\nIn the front was the sole demon that remained laying down over a huge wyvern, as he led his pack.\nThe shore loomed ahead. Soon, the slaughter would begin.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- The arc is about to end. Share your thoughts.",

      "content": "Chapter 108: Chapter 107- Carnage(1)\n*Dhak*\nAustin's eyes snapped open as he felt the ground trembling.\nHe instantly straightened his back and found Valerie standing near the window, \"Val?\" He called out.\nHowever, before Valerie could have responded, someone knocked on the door.\nValerie closed her mouth and instantly went to open the door, \"Sebastian.\" She called out with a frown\nThe older one gave a short bow before he entered inside wordlessly, and stood before Austin, \"Young Lord, the city is under attack.\"\nIt was unusual for Sebastian to sound so anxious, however, the news was quite severe and quite unexpected.\n\"The demonic army has attacked Drenovar from the ocean. And the one leading the army seems to be a Demon General.\"\nAustin had a severe frown on his face. This was unexpected. He couldn't have thought that a demon army could have suddenly attacked Drenovar out of the blue. And not just any passing army, but under a Demon General.\n'Did the canon event get pushed early?' Austin remembers that during the tournament, the venue gets attacked by an army of Demonic beasts, led by General Zeverath.\n\"Sebastian...did you see the Demon General? Did he have long red horns and chains around his neck?\"\nSebastian was taken aback, \"Yes...but how do you know, sir?\"\nAs he thought! The three demons were also sent by Zevarath. He has been planning on taking numerous talented humans under his domain and corrupting them to prepare for an army.\nHowever, why in the world did he attack early? Was it because of the failed attempt? But didn't the demon fail canonically as well?\n'No, this isn't the time.' Austin couldn't dwell on the thoughts. He couldn't compare the reality with what he had seen in the game.\n\"What is the situation at the Hellstain?\"\n\"Because of all the chaos, the Union Council member and a heavy amount of Drenovar's forces have been handling the situation at the shore. And because of that, several demons of Hellstain have broken the barricade and have infected several soldiers.\"\nAustin clicked his tongue. The situation was truly messed up.\nThe demonized humans would continue to grow and in no time, they would start infecting the citizens—turning Drenovar into ruins.\nThe most unfortunate part was the heavy clouds surrounding Drenovar, with a light drizzle falling over the capital. With no sunlight to weaken the demons, the city stood defenseless against them.\n'This is bad....if things continued like this then humanity would lose one of their pillars...'\nTaking the decision, Austin turned towards Sebastian, \"Sebas, things have changed. Now we need to handle the situation first.\"\nSebastian heaved a sigh of relief. For a moment, he wondered if his Lord would let Drenovar suffer since that would benefit Eryndor. But his young master hasn't turned apathetic.\n\"You need to get rid of all the demonized humans who have broken the barrier. Just don't let them reach the public.\" Considering Sebastian's agility and assassination skills, he was the perfect man for the job.\n\"Understood, sir.\"\nTurning towards Valerie, Austin said, \"Valerie, you need to go and check the shore for the situation. If you think they can handle the demons, then don't interfere. But if they can't....\"\n\"I understand.\" Valerie nodded.\nAustin was feeling a bit complicated about it. The Demon General was on S-rank on human scales, however, with much more experience than any other humans. That's why, sending her to the Shore was dangerous.\n\"Young master, what about you?\" Sebastian asked....if possible, the butler wanted the young master to stay in the motel. And Valerie would agree instantly.\nHowever, \"I am going to the Hellstain and keep an eye on the monsters which awaken. The presence of other demons must have accelerated the awakening.\"\nSebastian looked concerned, \"Please be safe out there, my Lord.\" Saying so, he excused himself and went towards the city.\nTurning toward Valerie, Austin was hugged immediately as he heard her, \"The only way I can avoid making mistakes, is when I know that you are safe. So please, take care.\"\nAustin hummed, \"I will...so please don't do anything reckless and only intervene when it's necessary.\"\nThe duo looked into each other's eyes before Valerie closed her eyes and leaned forward.\nAustin didn't think twice before kissing the girl, their lips meeting in a brief contact before parting.\n\"Best of luck, Val.\"\n°°°°°°°\nAfter parting ways with Austin, Valerie advanced toward the shore.\nAs she advanced, she could feel the profound presence of the demonic creatures from the shore.\n\"If I am not wrong, they haven't sent a single S-rank from the council,\" Valerie muttered to herself as she kept jumping from one building to another.\nThe S-rank warriors are the defense pillars of the Union Council and always remain in the headquarters. For the threat of a Hellstain, it was not unnatural for them to send only low-ranking officers.\nHowever, this was a national-level crisis and without any proper defense against the danger, it would be quite difficult to save Drenovar from its possible demise.\n\"Oh Lord...\" The moment Valerie's eyes caught the sight of the scene, her mind went blank for a moment, and a shiver ran down her spine.\nMore than thirty demonic beasts surged from the water, their massive bodies crashing into the defenses like living battering rams. Thick, scaled limbs shattered stone walls, while jagged teeth tore through flesh and armor alike. The soldiers fought desperately, but they were drowning in a tide of horror.\nScreams filled the air—some cut short, others stretching into agonized wails as men were crushed, ripped apart, or dragged beneath the bloodied waves. Smaller beasts swarmed through the chaos, pouncing on fallen warriors, their claws carving through flesh as they feasted. The scent of blood mixed with the salty wind was thick and suffocating.\nA soldier stumbled back, eyes wide with terror, only for a massive claw to clamp around his torso. His scream barely left his lips before he was yanked into the darkness of a beast's maw, bones crunching like dry twigs.\nThe line was breaking. The defenses were crumbling. And the demons were still coming.\n°°°°°°\nAfter leaving the motel, Sebastian decided to move through the streets and help the citizens to evacuate.\nThere was no guarantee that the demons from the demonic lands could be defeated any time soon. But they at least are limited to a certain extent. However, the demonized humans are growing rapidly. If it continues then no place within Drenovar would be safe.\n\"Ah!\" A woman suddenly fell while running away.\n\"*KHEEEUGH*\" The demonic human was just above her, inches away from tearing her life.\nSebastian instantly moved toward her and slashed his short sword to behead the demonized humans.\nHe didn't stop there; moving in practiced motion he slaughtered the demon thoroughly into bits and pieces until it lost its strength to recover.\nLooking at the woman, he offered his hand before suggesting, \"Run toward the south. The capital guards have prepared a safe shelter.\"\nThe woman continued to thank him until the very end before she ran away as suggested.\n\"*KHUEEEGH*\"\nSebastian heaved a sigh as he turned towards the horde of demons.\n\"This reminds me of the good old days of hunting.\"\n°°°°°°\nAustin reached the spot from where he had been keeping an eye on Hellstain....but the scene awaiting him this time was quite despairing.\n'Even the army of Drenovar couldn't resist the demonic waves....' The Hellstain in Drenovar was quite huge, which explains why so many demons are being spilled out.\nSoldiers were trying to fend off the danger by launching several spells at once; however, because of the natural resistance against magic and their ridiculous regeneration, the demons were recovering quickly.\nSome soldiers were running away, some were getting eaten alive.\nThe human barricade that was formed around the palace was having a hard time fighting against the demons and demonized humans as well.\nDozens of demonized humans are advancing toward the towns and chasing after civilians.\n'I should help...'\nAustin was thinking of advancing towards the Hellstain...when suddenly, a big ripple arrived from the Hellstain.\nThe stain began to pulse—slow, heavy beats, like a heart too large for this world. Ominous light seeped from its depths, and suddenly, the ground came alive. Soldiers near the stain screamed as an invisible force yanked them forward. Their bodies twisted, flesh peeling from their bones the moment they touched the stain. Their cries ended in wet, sickening gurgles.\n'Is it...' Austin's throat became dry in anxiety as he saw long fissures appearing on the surface, the ground trembling under the presence of the being that was about to awaken.\nThe earth trembled, then bulged upward, splitting like rotten flesh. A massive claw, black and glistening, tore free from the stain, followed by another. The air reeked of sulfur and rotting meat as the creature dragged itself into the world.\nA monstrous head emerged, splitting into three, its skull twisted and uneven, with empty sockets that suddenly flared with a sickly red glow. Its maw split open—not like a mouth, but like a wound tearing further, lined with writhing tendrils dripping black sludge.\nHuge claws that could crush several humans at once, and bent hind limbs. Chains were falling from the creatures' three necks.\nThe being awakens out of the blood of the Demon Lord. A hell resident has appeared.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

Wait!\" Hazir suddenly stood before his father, blocking his path.\nHis second son also stood before him as he said, \"You cannot go.\"\nThe Patriarch frowned, \"You two know the situation out there, but still stopping me?\" His voice sounded unnaturally cold as he told them, \"Move.\"\n\"No, father. You need to stay here and be the last line of defense.\" Hazir insisted, \"If you fall, there would be no one to command the soldiers and assure our people. You need to be here, and take the command, father.\"\nHearing his eldest son's voice, the King was forced to think about his decision once again.\nTarvin added, \"You are our strongest pillar of hope. And if something happens to you...I, us, and the whole country would fall into despair. So please, stay here.\"\nIn the end, the eldest one had to accept his son's suggestion and let them go, \"Just...be safe out there...\" Although he said that, he knew that only a miracle could save Drenovar from this disaster.\n°°°°°°°\n\"You were completely cramped there, Luke. How did you get out?\"\nLuke has been asked this several times by his teammates and sometimes by his opponents as well: how, when under pressure, does he become so insanely good at rugby?\nAnd his answer always remained the same,\n\"The thrill of pressure makes me just forget about everything and allows me to focus on my goal.\"\nAnd that was the same even today.\nAustin was in a pinch. The situation was critical on both sides; the coast and the main city. Although Sebastian was out there, decimating all the demonized humans, he also had a limit.\nAnd if the beast in front of his eyes gets out there, countless deaths await.\n'The demon is at the very least an A-rank...' The soldiers around the Stain were most likely to get destroyed by that amount of demons and the High Demon would be a huge hurdle to cross.\nAnd he needs to reach the coast in time as well, to ensure Valerie's safety.\nSo many things to consider, so many things to lose yet Austin found his mind calm and his heart beating rapidly in excitement.\n\"Hmm? Aren't they ...\" Austin's eyes suddenly caught the figure of two people who looked different from other soldiers—wearing expensive clothes and commanding the soldiers as soon as they appeared.\n\"The Princes of Drenovar...\" Austin watched as the eldest son immediately got into battle with the Greater Demon while the younger one was engaged in taking away the fallen soldiers and commanding the others who still could fight.\nBecause the majority of soldiers were fighting at the shore and around two hundred were surrounding the palace, only about fifty or so soldiers were left around the Hellstain.\n'They won't be able to handle it ...'\n°°°°°\nCLANG!\nHazir staggered back, his arms numb from blocking the Great Demon's claw. His bones rattled, and his grip on his Shard—his shield—nearly failed after just one clash.\n'That strength... It's A-rank!' He clenched his teeth and hurled his Shard at the three-headed beast charging toward him.\nGRRR!\nThe monster roared, swatting the shield aside like a toy before lunging forward, its claws thirsting for blood.\nHazir growled, yanking his hand back. His Shard shot toward him, doubling in speed, growing in size mid-flight—THWACK!—slamming into the beast's ribs.\nTING!\nThe impact sent it skidding, but only for a moment.\nHazir summoned his shield back, twisted mid-step, and flung it again—a razor-edged blur slicing through the air.\nBut this time—\n\"Huh?*\n—the beast vanished!\nHis heart lurched.\n\"BEHIND!\"\nTarvin's voice was raw with panic.\nHazir moved—but too late.\n**CRACK**!\n\"Khak!\" A heavy blow was dealt to his ribs, making his vision blurry as Hazir fell to the ground.\nTarvin's breath hitched. His brother—fallen, and motionless.\nThen—his stomach clenched.\nThe beast stood over Hazir, its mouth curling into a jagged grin.\nSlowly—deliberately—it raised its claw.\nIt was going to tear him apart.\n\"NO!\" Tarvin burst in a sprint but he knew he couldn't make it in time.\nThe duration of that monster to bring down its claw and the distance between them....it was not possible!\nThe strongest person in Tarvin's eyes had fallen to the ground, inches away from his death...and he, he couldn't do anything!\n\"Brother!\" The scream was more of a prayer as he hoped something—anything—to save him.\nCLANG!\nA sharp, jarring impact snapped Tarvin out of his despair. His feet skidded to a halt, breath frozen in his throat.\nHazir, barely able to turn his head, felt his chest tighten.\nA boy stood before him. Shard raised.\nBlocking the monster's strike.\n\"Y-You...\"\nThe boy didn't look back. His voice was sharp, commanding.\n\"Prince! Dodge!\"\nHazir moved on instincts as the boy suddenly twirled on his feet, allowing the claws of the beast to fall forward before the raven-haired stabbed the beast on the back of his neck.\n\"*GRUUUUUOOOO*\" The creature howled—a guttural, furious sound.\nNot from pain.\nFrom annoyance.\nAustin yanked his hand back, but the blade wouldn't budge.\nNo choice.\nHe abandoned his Shard and threw himself backward, just as the beast's claw sliced through the air where he had stood moments ago.\n\"Wh-Who are you?\" Tarvin asked as Austin stood inches away from him.\nAustin didn't turn to look at him before throwing away Wisp in a random direction.\nThe beast howled, launching its massive body in his direction.\nAustin scoffed before bringing his hand down and striking the beast using the boomerang, on top of its head.\n**DHAK**\nA dull sound resonated as the demon failed to dodge the attack in time and hit the ground.\n\"It hasn't unlocked its full potential.\" Austin realized since that attack could have been easily dodged by an A-rank.\n\"Prince Hazir, can I have your assistance in this battle?\" Austin asked as he saw the Prince finally getting back to his feet.\nHazir, while ignoring the excruciating pain from his chest, nodded, \"You are...helping us out...naturally, I will fight...\"\n\"But brother...\" Tarvin wanted to say something but was interrupted by his brother,\n\"No Tarby. You need to stand back and use your Shard when it's time.\"\nTarvin gritted his teeth...his damn useless Shard can't help his brother when he needed him the most.\n\"Here it comes,\" Austin voiced as he summoned his Shard in his hand and got prepared.\nThe beast shook itself, rage burning in its glowing eyes. It lunged—quicker than before, its claws cutting through the air like blades.\nAustin dashed forward, his Shard elongating mid-swing as he drove it toward the monster's throat.\nCLANG!\nThe beast twisted, intercepting with a claw, sending sparks flying.\nHazir was already moving. He spun his Shard and slammed it into the demon's ribs. The force sent tremors through his arms, but the monster staggered, growling in frustration.\nAustin ducked under a wild swing, closing in from the side. He slashed—his blade cutting deep into the demon's shoulder.\nGRUUUUUOOOO!\nThe beast roared and retaliated with a tail swipe.\n\"Move!\" Austin shouted.\nHazir barely managed to throw his shield in front of him before the tail crashed into him. He skidded backward, boots digging into the dirt, the breath knocked from his lungs.\nAustin leaped onto the beast's back, plunging his Shard into its spine.\nThe creature thrashed violently, slamming itself against the ground to crush him.\nAustin yanked his blade free and jumped just in time, landing beside Hazir.\n\"You good?\" he asked, panting.\nHazir gritted his teeth, gripping his Shard tightly. \"Yeah.\"\nThe beast reared up, its three heads snarling.\n\"*UOOOOOOOOGH*\" The beast suddenly howled, its massive maw splitting and the ground trembling under the effect of its massive presence.\nA shiver ran down Hazir's spine and Austin also felt the strength behind that howl.\n'This is bad...' Austin ducked low, as he prepared.\nJust as the three-headed beast turned towards him, Austin lunged forward, aiming to plunge his dagger into the beast and end the game.\nHowever,\n[Alert!]\n[The enemy has used the skill Paralysis!]\nAustin's eyes widened as his body slowly came to pause under the glowing red eyes of the beast.\nThe beast moved, its form vanishing in an instant.\nAustin closed his eyes; knowing that he rushed at the wrong time.\nHowever, before the demon could have slashed at him,\n**FUOOOOOO**\nA melodious sound resonated, making the demon slower with each stride, and just in time, Hazir brought his shield before Austin to protect him.\n*CLANG*\nThe demon's claw was met by the shield, and once again, it failed to attack before Hazir pushed the beast back.\n\"Haaah....you saved me there...\" The moment Austin and the demon broke eye contact, the paralysis effect dulled—allowing him to move freely.\nHe turned to look at the other Prince and found him holding his Shard—in the shape of a flute.\nHazir gave him a firm nod, before saying, \"Eyes forward. It's still alive.\"\nAustin growled, \"Not for long,\" as he summoned his Axe in one hand and his Shard in another.\nTime to go all out.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- This A-rank doesn't actually define A-rank.

      "content": "Chapter 110: Chapter 109- Carnage(3)\nIn the books, it was mentioned that the Demon Lord had four Generals who became quite a hurdle for the Hero's party during their quest to defeat the epitome of evilness.\nValerie remembers those four beings—their description was enough for her to know what kind of strength they must have held to even trouble the legendary warrior Kane.\nThat's why, when she came across the one who was riding the wyvern, she knew that it wasn't a Demon General.\n'It is a Greater Demon, but not a General...' A General-ranked demon would at least take a group of S-rank veterans to defeat. However, the one she was looking at, didn't give off that presence which could make her feel threatened.\nAround the shore, chaos raged as the team from the Union Council, alongside the soldiers, desperately held the line.\nSeventeen council members and a hundred soldiers remained, barely keeping the danger from spilling further inland.\nThe council members focused on the massive ocean monsters, wielding their rare artifacts and Shards to push them back. Meanwhile, the soldiers clashed with demons that had the terrifying ability to walk on land.\nOnly the Council possessed such powerful artifacts—allowing them to levitate, create barriers, and heal quickly with special potions. But beyond their tools, their coordination was almost supernatural. A single glance was enough to communicate, their movements weaving together seamlessly.\nHIINNGRRRR!\nA monstrous sea turtle, large enough to crush buildings, slammed into an invisible wall. Three council members held their hands out, straining to keep the shimmering barrier in place as waves crashed violently around them. More creatures loomed in the water, but the barriers prevented them from reaching the shore.\n\"KHUEEENG!\"\nThe demons lunged toward the city, their thick shells glistening under the dim sky. Soldiers met them head-on, their blades scraping against the hard exteriors. Though their weapons only left shallow cuts, they refused to give an inch, forcing the creatures back through sheer grit and determination.\n'Should I interfere...' They were somehow handling the situation, and remembering her Lord's words, she was hesitant to show herself.\nIt was then,\n\"You...\" The Greater Demon, who was lying on the wyvern until now, called out after sitting up, \"... is the one who killed my men, right?\"\nValerie frowned—there was no point in hiding since the demon had already sensed her.\n'As Austin said...I am bad at suppressing my presence...' Something she has been practicing lately, but it seems it wasn't enough.\nGetting out of the hiding spot, she faced the Demon while standing atop a building.\nThe demon's face split into a grin as he said, \"You are strong...someone I want by my side. Leave the human territory and come with me. Your talent would be utilized in the best way possible.\"\nWhen the Demon began speaking, many people turned to look at her, and for some reason, the Demonic Beasts stopped moving all at once.\nNow, the whole focus was on Valerie.\nAnd in response to that proposal, all she said was,\n\"I refuse.\" Anything that separates her from Austin is impossible to accept. And here, the creature is asking her to shift sides and become a Demon?\nPest really has a rotting mind.\nThe Demon lowered its head slightly, before muttering, \"If you don't accept,\" *SHLINK*\nSuddenly, a crimson blade burst from the Greater Demon's hand before piercing three Union Council members—followed by an explosion from within as their bodies burst by the huge spikes that emerged from the blade.\n\"Aghh...\" The nearby soldiers felt bile welling up, seeing the gore from so close.\nThe innards of the soldiers fell to the water and tainted the clear water with red.\nThe demon looked back up and asked, with a slight tilt of its head, \"What about now?\"\nValerie crossed her arms, \"Do you think it affects me?\" The tone she carried contained no identifiable emotion.\nThose eyes reflected nothing but emptiness and indifference.\nThe Demon was actually taken aback—this was the first time it saw a human showing no empathy toward their brethren.\n\"Interesting...you are more interesting than I expected.\" The Demon suddenly disappeared from sight—and Valerie instinctively stepped back before the Demon appeared just before her.\nLowering itself, it looked into her eyes before muttering, \"Today, either I die or I conquer you.\"\nThe temperature around Valerie began to fall as she summoned her Shiverfall,\nThe people around them gasped and held their breath upon the realization of her identity.\nThe battle between two S-ranks was about to begin.\n°°°°°°°°\nAustin and Hazir weren't doing well near the Stain.\nAlthough the soldiers had somehow limited the movements of the other demons, Sebastian has been decimating the demonized humans. However, nothing would work, if Austin fails to defeat this mutt.\n'This is bad...that thing is turning stronger with each attack....'\nWith sweat and blood tricking down his head, Austin looked at the beast that was standing there—now taller and stronger.\nBy his side, the Prince seemed to be struggling quite a lot as well. He has been thrown to the ground quite many times, and Austin knew that he wouldn't be able to continue for long like this.\n\"Prince...none of our attacks has been damaging the beast....its weak point is ....those three heads in my knowledge...\" Austin spoke, as he tried to calm his breathing.\n\"I also think so...but even making a dent on that thing is getting difficult...\" The beast was quite agile and could sense blood lust, and that made it difficult to attack it.\n\"I think I have pla—\"\nAustin never got to finish. The beast lunged, a blur of muscle and malice, tearing toward them.\nReacting instantly, Austin slammed his axe to the ground. BOOM! A burst of blinding light exploded outward. The beast faltered, its charge stuttering as it reeled from the sudden flare.\nBut hesitation was fatal.\nA massive barrier shot forward like a battering ram, slamming into the creature before it could recover.\n\"HAAAAAH!\" Hazir roared, muscles straining, veins bulging as he drove the beast back, his Shard blazing like a second sun.\nYet, even against overwhelming force, an A-rank was an A-rank.\nThe beast's claws dug into the ground. Its retreat slowed. Then stopped.\nA guttural snarl tore from its throat as it gripped the barrier's edges, muscles coiling with monstrous strength. The tide turned. Hazir's feet slid back. The beast bared its fangs, ready to crush him—\n*Tink*\nIts ears twitched. Instincts screamed.\nEyes snapped skyward.\nThere, Austin hovered, his body crackling with lightning, the axe in his grip shining like a star about to fall.\nPanic flashed in the beast's gaze. It abandoned the barrier, legs tensing to retreat when suddenly—\n*FUOOOOOO*\nA flute's haunting note sliced through the battlefield.\nThe beast's body stiffened. Its head sagged, movements sluggish, its instincts dulled for just an instant—\nJust enough.\n*CRACKLE*\nThe sky roared in fury. Clouds blackened.\nThen lightning fell.\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\nBolts of lightning, thick as tree trunks, tore down in rapid succession, striking with earth-rending force. Each impact sent shockwaves rippling through the battlefield, turning stone to dust and carving trenches into the ground.\nThe beast convulsed. Flesh burned. Muscles locked. The force of the storm drove it to its knees, every fiber of its being writhing under the merciless onslaught.\nThe people around them could only stare in awe as they witnessed a power so terrifying that it could shake up one's confidence even before the battle began.\nAnd through the blinding storm of light and fury—Austin descended, axe raised, eyes locked onto the weakened prey.\n\"Its left head....\" Hazir muttered as Austin landed beside him, \"...it's no longer moving....\"\nA ray of hope emerged on the horizon as Hazir saw one of the heads of the beast not moving anymore.\n\"The battle hasn't ended, Prince,\" Austin spoke, his breathing slightly uneven. That attack just now....took a huge toll on his Soul Energy. If not for his recent fight with the giants that allowed him to know more about the axe, he might have ended up harming himself back there.\n\"You are right...\" The redhead royalty raised his shield and got ready to resume the battle as they saw the beast getting back on its beasts.\nIts skin was slightly charred, smoke erupting from its body and the eyes of the other two alive heads were closed.\n\"It looks weaker now...we should finish this as soon as we can,\" Hazir spoke as he leaned forward, ready to lunge.\n'Something is off...' Austin narrowed his eyes as he felt the aura of the beast quite threatening, compared to before.\nHowever, as Hazir said it was looking weaker than before, that's why, \"We should-*SQUELCH*\"\nAustin's voice got choked as he felt something stabbing into his body, and the sensation registered a moment later.\nSlowly turning his eyes down, Austin found the demon standing inches away from him, its hand pressed against his stomach, and its long nails dug into his flesh.\n\"KHEUGH,\" Austin vomited blood, as he felt his eyes darkening.\nThe sensation of death has never been more vivid as the axe from his hand dropped and his Shard faded into nothingness.\n....\n...\n..\n.\n[Alert!]\n[Host's origin is getting overwritten!]\n[Code: Red]\n[Emergency Protocol: Activated]\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- That's called blatant plot armour.",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Chapter 110- Carnage(End)\n[Hazir's POV:]\nIt was horror.\nI have seen numerous fighters all my life.\nThose whom I remember always left a remarkable impression on me through their battle wits and unfaltering courage.\nAs a Prince and someone who would be inheriting the throne in a few years, I also have gone through numerous battles in the past.\nHowever, none of them was anything as gruesome and horrifying as this one.\nThe three-headed demon, which was overwhelming our forces, and later me and the black-haired boy, was currently getting overwhelmed.\nThe beast that rose from the Hellstain was a force of nature that I thought we would never be able to defeat.\nAt one point, I thought we had already lost the battle when the main force of resistance, the strange boy, was stabbed by the demon.\nI thought it was the end.\n...until the boy suddenly radiated a strange aura which made me step back in terror. An aura that was too eerie and profound for a human. It almost felt like, I was standing before two beasts.\nHowever, soon I realized that I was comparing completely incomparable beings.\n\"B-Brother...\" My younger brother, Tarvy, had a pale complexion as he saw the boy easily parrying all the attacks that the demon threw at him. And in return, the retaliation sent tremors through the ground. Making it feel unbelievable that it was the same boy who was struggling alongside me a moment ago.\n'What in the world is he...'\n....\nAs Hazir expressed, the beast was getting overwhelmed by a human.\nThe ground shook as the massive demon, once unstoppable, now struggled to keep up.\nAustin didn't speak. He didn't shout. He moved without hesitation, his actions cold and precise.\nOne of the demon's heads lunged at him, jaws wide open, ready to tear him apart. But before it could bite down, CRACK—Austin's fist struck with terrifying force, shattering its teeth. Broken fangs scattered across the ground.\nThe second head spewed black fire, engulfing him in flames. But when the fire cleared, Austin stood there, untouched. The flames had done nothing. The demon hesitated.\nThat slight pause was all Austin needed.\nIn an instant, he was in front of the second head. He grabbed one of its sharp canines and SNAP—twisted it clean off. The demon barely had time to scream before he slammed it into the ground so hard the earth split beneath it.\nThe demon thrashed, trying to fight back, but Austin was faster. A claw strike? He dodged and crushed the arm before it could reach him. A tail swing? He grabbed it and slammed the demon into the ground with its own strength. Every attack it tried only made things worse.\nThen, without a sound, Austin leaped high into the air. The wind howled as he came down, his fist slamming into the demon's body.\nBOOM!\nThe ground split apart. A shockwave tore through the battlefield. The massive creature lay still, broken, and defeated.\nAustin's cold eyes looked down upon the demon, his hand raised before his Shard appeared in his hand.\nOnce a small dagger was now coated in lightning\nAustin's body began to levitate, much like a God—ready to make the judgment.\nThe demon thrashed and tried to move away since its instincts loudly screamed about the danger.\nHowever, Austin has left the demon completely tattered and broken as he continues to levitate until he becomes one with the dark skies.\nHis Shard devoured the lightning that crashed from the sky, drinking in its fury like a starving beast. His entire body pulsed with an eerie glow, flickering between brilliance and shadow.\nHis eyes—once dark and human—were now empty voids, stripped of all emotion. They no longer held pupils and no longer reflected life. Instead, they burned like twin full moons, cold, distant, and unnerving, as if something far beyond human was staring back.\nThe demon trembled, its head shaking and body convulsing under the sheer display of strength and brutality.\nHazir and others have long stepped away from the calamity that seemed far more dangerous than the mutt.\n*CRACKLE*\nAustin twisted his body, and the Shard, now more like a thunderbolt, held behind his body.\nA moment of pause and then—\n**BOOOOOOOOM**\n—devastation befell.\n°°°°°°°\n[A few moments ago]\nValerie was having a hard time fighting against the demon.\nShe was restricted from using the spell she recently discovered while fighting the Monkey. She was told by the Headmaster that if the Union Council got to know about it, Valerie would be forced to serve the Council.\n'This can't go for long...I need to help him!'\nValerie lunged forward, her spear coated in a thick layer of frost, aiming straight for the demon's chest. But in a blink—WHOOSH—the demon vanished, reappearing behind her.\nShe twisted just in time. CLANG! Her spear met the demon's claws, the force sending shockwaves rippling through the air. Ice spread from her weapon, but the demon teleported again, dodging the creeping frost.\nBOOM!\nA sudden explosion of wind sent dust flying as the demon reappeared above her, claws glowing with dark energy. It slashed down—CRACK—splitting the ground where Valerie had stood a moment ago. But she was gone.\nSHING!\nA blinding arc of ice shot from her spear, slicing toward the demon. It barely teleported away in time, but not fast enough to avoid the freezing air—its arm stiffened for a split second. That was all she needed.\nValerie surged forward. BAM! She drove her spear straight into its ribs, ice exploding from the point of impact. The demon snarled and teleported mid-air, shaking off the frost just as Valerie spun around, already predicting its next move.\nThe instant it appeared again—WHOOSH—a barrage of icicles rained toward it. The demon zipped through the attack, flickering in and out of sight, but Valerie kept up, her spear spinning faster than the eye could track.\nBOOM!\nThey clashed again. The force cracked the earth, sending waves of broken stone outward. Valerie's spear lashed out, aiming for its heart. The demon teleported at the last moment, appearing inches from her face.\n\"As I thought, you are strong.\" The demon praised, a wild grin lifting the edges of its lips.\nValerie's eyes were devoid of any emotion as she raised her hand to punch the demon.\nHowever, just inches away from the target, she felt it.\n**BOOOOOOOM**\nBoth the demon and the human sides were shaken up by the explosion that occurred near the palace.\nThe explosion shook the core of the nation and illuminated the whole capital.\nThe waves of energy can shake up one belief in continuing the battle.\nA devastating blow, enough to threaten two S-ranks.\nThe whole capital of Drenovar saw it...the dawn of destruction.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Drop a comment.

      "content": "Chapter 112: Chapter 111- Peace established\n\"What would happen if I suddenly die at some point, system?\" Austin one of those days asked, while he was taking a bath.\nConsidering the dangers of the world, he usually gets the thought that at some point…or maybe more than once he would be pushed to the very verge of death. This world was very imbalanced, the demonic side has quality and quantity both.\nTo survive in this world, Austin must utilize his future knowledge to endure those calamities and somehow defeat the demon lord.\nNaturally, when that time comes, he will have to go through several life-threatening situations.\n[Ding!]\n[Host's existence is necessary for the system to exist.]\n[In case of emergency, the system would use resources from the future features of the system, to overcome the disaster.]\nAustin raised his brows, \"What do you mean by that?\"\n[The system would utilize the resources from the future features, for example, the potions from {Shop} would be utilized to ensure the Host's safety.]\nAustin was taken aback. Does the system really have such a defense mechanism?\nHe actually didn't believe that such a thing was possible....however, recently, he realized that the system might not be lying.\n...\n\"Ugh...\" Austin's head was groaning, as he slowly opened his eyes and allowed his vision to get accustomed to the illumination around him.\nThe first person on whom his eyes landed, made him feel relieved, \"Val...\" He extended his hand in a daze, and Valerie instantly held it back.\n\"How do you feel now?\" She asked, her voice soothing his headache.\n\"Just this ringing sound in my ears...\"\n\"That's to be expected. You ruptured your eardrums.\"\nAnother familiar voice ushered Austin to turn his head.\nThere sat his loyal butler, wearing his usual attire of a three-piece suit.\nSeeing his clothes, Austin realized something as he instantly turned his head back to Valerie and found her hair and eyes back to their original shade.\nAustin's eyes widened, as he whispered, \"Val...why do you look like that?\"\n\"Because she no longer needs a disguise.\" This time...the voice was unfamiliar.\nAustin blinked in confusion before he straightened his back and looked at the person...no, people standing across from him.\nAustin now realized that he was lying on a huge bed and the room was too big to be a motel room.\nThe three people who stood there were evidently royalty. And the one who spoke was, undoubtedly,\n\"Your Majesty ...\" The King of Drenovar.\n\"The second Prince of Eryndor, Austin. This is the first time for us to meet.\" The man spoke with his hands crossed on his chest.\nThe other two smiled warmly at the boy as the young Prince stepped forward and asked, \"How do you feel now? Your wounds disappeared in the time we brought you here.\"\nHearing Tarvin's words, Austin suddenly looked down at his stomach.\nIndeed, the deep marks of the demon's nail have already disappeared. And rather than the physical weakness, he was feeling all fine.\nHis mind suddenly recalled something crucial as he asked, \"What about the demonic army that attacked from the shore?\"\nTarvin informed, \"After that explosion, they suddenly retreated.\"\nSebastian added, \"It was strange since it was the perfect time for them to infiltrate. But they chose to retreat.\"\nValerie ran away from the battlefield the moment she realized where the explosion occurred. However, the demons didn't exploit the chance to enter Drenovar.\n\"Let's not think about what didn't happen,\" The Supreme Authority got up from his seat, and said, \"For now, I just want to thank you three for saving my family and my people.\"\nAustin tried to get up as the King neared the bed, however, Idris gestured for him to remain seated.\n\"I don't know why you were here, but in exchange for what you have done, I am ready to grant you any wish you may have.\"\nAustin felt his heart finally gaining the peace it had been searching for so long.\nAlthough all the plans he made went haywire because of the sudden arrival of the demonic army, in the end, he achieved what he came for.\n\"Just....forget about our past and let's establish a friendly connection, Your Majesty. There is nothing more I could wish or ask for.\"\nAustin decided to relay his desire straightforwardly rather than making it complicated by bringing losses and gains of this war into the discussion.\nHe just doesn't want either Eryndor or Drenovar to perish because of their role during the Great War.\nIt wasn't like Idris didn't expect something like this. However, what surprised him was,\n\"Did your father send you alone with your fiancée to pacify the situation?\" It was more like Idris was amazed at the fact.\nAustin smiled at the older one, \"He didn't tell me anything...rather, it was me who told him that I would somehow resolve the situation. And I think I fulfilled my promise.\"\nIdris couldn't stop himself from chuckling as he patted Austin on his shoulder, \"What a remarkable young man you are. Tarvin should learn from you.\"\n\"I can learn anything but to fight from him. You should have seen hi, father, how ruthless...\"\nThe conversation continued between the people. Meanwhile, Austin's gaze traveled toward his beloved.\nHer warm gaze and that soft smile were the best reward he could get after all this hard work.\n°°°°°°°°\n\"*Cough*\" The former king coughed a few times, making Austin slightly nervous.\nHowever, the way his scars began to heal and his complexion returned to normal, allowed everyone in the room to exhale a breath of relief.\n\"F-Father...\" Idris called out in a shaky voice as he saw his father's eyes wet and his mouth slightly parted.\n\"...I-It doesn't hurt...anymore...\" The former king spoke...rather than just groaning in pain, he actually spoke!\nThe whole family grouped around the former patriarch, finally seeing the man recovering from the illness he has been suffering from, for this long.\nAll thanks to Austin.\nHazir, who was wrapped in bandages, rested his hand on Austin's shoulder as he said, \"You have done a huge favor for our family. The Drenovar family will never forget it.\"\nSaying so, the Prince hugged Austin—his eyes wet with tears.\nAustin glanced at Valerie and found the girl turning stiff.\nHe couldn't help but smile at that, as a thought crossed his mind,\n'This definitely would ruin your plans, Aiden. Just a few more days before I throw you back where you belong.'\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Arc ends here. Drop a comment.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: Chapter 112- True face(1)\n[Two days later]\nIn Eryndor, a gathering of people has been arranged.\nThose who were worried about the King's health gathered in the royal court to see and greet the King.\nNaturally, because of so many people here, the security of the royal court was extra strict as well. And those who were allowed to enter the palace were thoroughly examined near the entrance.\nOn the throne, Cedric was seated. Although he seemed slightly feverish, he was quite better in comparison to how he was when Austin came to meet him.\nHis strict diet and regular sessions with the healers allowed the man to recover well.\nAnd since it was still not discovered who and how someone poisoned the King, the food he eats is still being prepared by the butler.\nNow, in the royal court, those who have gathered expressed their relief upon seeing their Monarch being healthy once again.\n\"Your Majesty, my eyes are blessed to see you in good health.\" One of the men, who was a farmer by profession, knelt on the floor with his hands clasped.\n\"It really put us at ease to see our ruler in good health.\" A woman added, having a smile of relief on her face.\nCedric couldn't stop himself from smiling. Seeing how much he was loved by his people, makes him feel that he hasn't failed his predecessor.\nThe Queen, who was sitting behind the curtains, also smiled in elation, upon finding that so many people cared about her husband.\n\"It's the well wishes of my people that I have recovered so well,\" Cedric spoke, his voice soothing the hearts of many.\nAlthough Eryndor was a small country, Cedric has always ensured that within his jurisdiction, everyone gets to eat three meals a day.\nHe even goes out regularly to inspect the situation with regular people and take necessary action to improve their situation.\nIt was his wife's idea to take a couple of steps for people's betterment—like providing monthly ration to the family members of those who are serving the country. And employment to those who live in remote areas.\nWith the help of responsible ministers who work under him, Cedric has established a harmonious family within Eryndor.\nJust like others, Duke Corwon also had a soft smile on his face as he heard the blessings of the people.\nHowever, the person sitting on the second seat on the left—the first Prince of the nation, looked quite bored by all this.\nHe really didn't want to be a part of this at all, however, convincing his mother against it would have been a little too much. The lady still loves her husband quite a lot, and his skill wouldn't have been able to overwrite that.\nBut maybe slowly, he would somehow corrupt the woman and use her to his benefit.\n'I guess it's enough now...' Deciding to prepone his plans, Aiden glanced at one of the ministers across from him.\nThe minister nodded before he turned toward someone in the crowd.\nIt was then—\n\"You are unfair!\" Amidst the peaceful ceremony, suddenly a woman cried.\nEvery eye turned towards her as the weeping woman came to the front and cried again,\n\"You are sacrificing our lives for the sake of your son!\"\nPeople suddenly began whispering, wondering what the woman was spouting all of a sudden.\nCedric had a frown on his face as he heard the woman,\n\"My husband died at the hands of the spies from Drenovar. My whole life is ruined, and now, you are about to risk everyone who depends on you...who trusts you!\"\nThe soldiers were already moving, raising their spears, and were about to take the woman away.\nAiden glared at the minister, before he got up, \"What are you spouting, woman?! Say clearly!\"\nPrime Minister frowned upon seeing the senior adviser suddenly adding oil to the small fire.\nHearing his words, even the soldiers paused, allowing the woman to add, \"Hener extended a helping hand in exchange for punishing your second son. And with their help, we all know that we will win against Drenovar! Yet you....you chose your son over your nation!\"\nCedric's brows were creased. He didn't know how, but it seemed the news of Hener's proposal had gone out.\n'It might be their doing...' Cedric thought that it might be someone from Hener who spread the news.\nHowever, the King completely missed to notice a certain young man with silver hair, grinning slightly at the scene.\nThe piece of information was spread amongst the people and everyone began muttering about it soon.\nPrime Minister Arthur gritted his teeth—why are they letting it continue.\nHe suddenly rose from his seat before commanding, \"Take that woman away now-\"\n\"Is it true, Prime Minister? Did we really get a helping hand?\" Someone from the crowd asked the man.\n\"Tell us, Prime Minister? Is it really true?\" Another voice and the question were the same.\nFollowing them were several more voices, asking the same thing again and again.\nAiden wore a perfect facade and got up from his seat, before asking the Prime Minister, \"Should we push them out?\"\nArthur shook his head, \"Not giving them any answer would only make things worse. These are people, not criminals, whom we can silence.\"\nDuke Corwon nodded, \"Yes, we need to give them an answer, or this will grow into rebellion in no time.\"\nNothing is above one's life. All the help and kindness the King extended toward his people would be forgotten in an instant if their lives were on the line.\nThe situation was getting more severe passing each moment.\nSophie was restlessly glancing between her son and her husband, thinking who would get up to resolve the situation. However, the growing agitation of the people didn't seem like something that could be tamed easily.\nAmidst the growing tension, suddenly, a soldier arrived at the court, weaving through the people, he stood in the middle of the court before announcing,\n\"Y-Your Majesty, a convoy...from Drenovar.\"\nCedric instantly rose from his seat followed by the other ministers, as the Supreme Authority voiced,\n\"Alert all the posts and tell them to engage right away!\" He couldn't understand how the forces of Drenovar even reached the capital without him receiving any information.\nAiden also frowned at the news. This was quite unexpected. Weren't they attacked by demons a few days ago? Why did they suddenly decide to attack.\nIt was then, when the soldier informed something crucial about this convoy, \"Your Majesty, the one leading the convoy is the Second

      "content": "Chapter 114: Chapter 113- True face(2)\nThe main palace of Eryndor has never been this crowded before.\nThe second Prince who was supposed to be in the Academy, returned home with the convoy of the nation who was on the verge of war with Eryndor.\nAiden realized one thing from this, and that is he was betrayed by Morkel.\nAustin wasn't in the Academy, but in Drenovar, and sensing the friendly face the messenger from Drenovar held, the First Prince knew that something bad was about to happen.\nHowever, even though he didn't want it to happen, Aiden had no other option but to listen,\n\"Your Majesty, King of Eryndor, Guardian of these lands, I bring you the message sent from Drenovar—sent by the Monarch.\"\nCedric wordlessly remained seated. Although he wanted to ask a few things from Austin, who was standing not so far away from the messenger, the King prioritized the messenger for now.\nThe crowd of people has been silenced completely, and the Ministers, including the chief advisor—on the wordless command of Aiden—were patiently listening to the message.\n\"For the losses I have caused, for the threats I have brought forth, and for the feuds that have long stained the history between our nations—I offer neither excuse nor justification. The wounds of the past are undeniable, and the bond once shared by our realms has been fractured.\nYet, let it be known that none of this holds weight any longer after the deeds of Second Prince Austin. His actions have not only mended what was broken but have also forged a new path for our people. For what he has done for Drenovar, I speak not merely as a king, but as a man indebted beyond measure.\n\"I, Idris, King of Drenovar, extend my hand in a truce between our two nations.\nThe past has been marred by conflict, by losses suffered, and by wounds that time has struggled to heal. I do not seek to erase what has been, nor do I deny the burdens carried by both our peoples. Yet, after the noble deeds of Austin, I can no longer allow old grudges to dictate the future of our realms.\nIn light of his actions and the debt Drenovar owes, I set aside past enmities and propose peace—a truce that shall stand as the foundation of renewed understanding. May this be the first step toward a future where our nations no longer clash as adversaries but walk forward with dignity and wisdom.\nMay your judgment guide this decision, and may our people find strength in unity rather than division.\"\nA wave of elation spread through the royal court upon hearing the message from Drenovar.\nThe people, who were blaming Cedric until a few minutes ago, were sighing in relief and rejoicing at the fact that the enemy nation had ceased fire.\nAustin couldn't stop himself from grinning seeing the pale complexion of his dear elder brother.\nThe way he looked at the messenger with his eyes widened was a sight worth taking numerous pictures of.\nCedric's chest swelled with pride upon hearing his son's name in the message. It turned out that Austin indeed had a plan to pacify the situation with Drenovar. And he somehow convinced those people who have been an enemy of Eryndor for years.\n'You have made me proud, Austin...'\nWith a smile, Cedric told the messenger, \"I will extend my response soon. You may return now.\"\nThe messenger gave a brief bow, before taking his leave. His role was just to extend the proposal of truce and he did what he was told.\nOnce he was gone, the citizens were also told to leave since the matter needed to be discussed among the council.\nAnd this time, the general public didn't protest since they already had gained assurance that there would be no war anymore.\nOnce they were gone, only the ministers of the upper council and the individuals of high noble ranking remained in the court.\n\"This is unexpected, Your Majesty, but I think we should immediately respond to them in kind. If they had extended a friendly proposal, we never were a war-loving side.\" Arthur spoke, with slight excitement reflecting in his voice.\nHe couldn't be any more relieved to know that the nation that has been targeting Eryndor for so long has actually suggested a truce.\n\"It is all thanks to you, Austin,\" Arthur spoke, a thankful smile lifting the edges of his lips.\nAlthough it was hard to swallow for some, like Duke Corwon, it was a fact that the one who brought this change in Drenovar's attitude was none other than the Second Prince.\nThe same useless and talentless Prince whom everyone thought was a spoilt kid.\n'My daughter didn't choose him just for his face, huh...' The man heaved a sigh of relief.\nCedric was about to say something when suddenly, \"We shouldn't accept their proposal!\" A booming voice resonated in the court.\nThe person silenced everyone as he stood at his place with his head leaning down.\nAustin frowned, as he felt a sudden sensation making his head heavy, 'So this is the effect of his Shard. Manipulative bastard.'\nAiden continued, \"Father, with all respect, we shouldn't forget what those people have done to us. Constantly tormenting our people, slaughtering so many soldiers, and making a joke out of us in front of the whole world.\"\nThe voice of the first Prince resonated across the royal court, the effect of Shard working on those effectively who already were in his favor. And that included the Queen as well.\nWith his left hand pressed against his chest, the silver head spoke, \"It pains me...every time I visit the graveyard and see the numerous tombstones of those soldiers who were killed by those vermins!\"\nTurning his reddened eyes toward his father, he added, \"And now they are weakened because of the Hellstain they are offering a helping hand?! Am I the only one who can see their true face?\"\nThe First Prince turned around and looked at other ministers. Some were lowering their heads and some were nodding in assent.\nIt was true that many had already agreed to this truce...but now that the first Prince reminded them, they indeed shouldn't forget what Drenovar had inflicted on them.\nHowever, while tens of people were in agreement with Aiden, there were a few who didn't agree with him. And one of them was the Prime Minister,\n\"We also have damaged their forces. And it's a fact that in the past Eryndor failed to protect the King and Queen of Drenovar. We should not let our past grievances influence our future.\"\nAiden covered his forehead with his hand as he asked in shock, \"You are saying that, Sir Arthur? You, who knows the best how sly and deceiving those people can be?\"\nWith a snarl, the first Prince added, \"They will extend a friendly hand today and stab us in the back tomorrow. And at that time when we would be at our most vulnerable phase.\"\nNow many people, or to say, apart from four people in the court, everyone was under the influence of Aiden's words and his skill.\nAiden glanced at his younger brother for a moment, before he turned toward the Supreme Authority with his hands held behind his back,\n\"Your Majesty, as the heir of the family and the first Prince of the nation, I show my clear resistance toward this truce. I am saying for sure that this agreement will only cause Eryndor harm. And as a Prince, I cannot let that happen.\"\nSilence ensued after that.\nEveryone who held authority was in agreement with what Aiden proposed.\nTheir eyes were clouded by the belief that following Aiden was the only way for Eryndor to survive.\nEven the Queen had a firm expression upon hearing her son's words.\n'Austin...you have once again made the wrong decision...but your brother won't let us fall.'\nThe whole situation was flipped within minutes.\nJust a few minutes ago, everyone was elated by the fact that the long rivalry between the two nations was finally coming to an end.\nAnd it wasn't that the Council that interfered. It was the Second Prince who brought this miraculous change.\nHowever, the situation changed faster than the weather.\n'Sorry Austin, but I can't let you become the new favorite~~'\nJust as Aiden thought he had gained victory despite the unfavorable situation, someone entered the royal court,\n*Clap* *Clap*\nEvery eye turned toward the person who walked inside.\nWearing a three-piece black suit and neatly combed grey hair, everyone knew the identity of the man who once served the King.\nSebastian could be seen in an unnatural mood. A smile on his face but the man's eyes weren't smiling at all.\n\"Sebastian...\" Aiden called out, his tone carrying bitterness.\nThe butler ignored the first Prince as he stood beside his young master, before calling out,\n\"I hoped, Your Majesty...hoped that Young Master Austin has a misconception about his brother. That, Your Highness Aiden isn't the man he believed him to be. I hoped that I could help rebuild this family somehow.\"\nWith his eyes turning frosty, the man added, \"However, after what I witnessed today, I can no longer stay silent and let this continue.\"\n*Snap*\nAs he snapped his fingers, a few more people entered the court.\nAustin was surprised to find Rhea and Rudolph entering the court. And not just them, there was the Vice-headmaster of the Academy as well.\nHowever, the person who caused Aiden's complexion to change was the same soldier he sent to the Academy.\nHe was still alive!\n'Morkel....you a*shole!!!!'\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Damn, Morkel played it well.

Is this an exhibition that you are bringing people from here and there, Sebastian?\"\nThe chief advisor asked in a frustrated tone as he glared at the grey-haired man.\nAlthough he didn't know who was the soldier they brought along, seeing Aiden's reaction the Chief Advisor knew that it was bad news.\nOrwold Sigmund, the finance minister added, \"We are having a discussion about our relation with Drenovar, and Sebastian, you no longer are a part of the council. So should we consider this disrespect against the King?\"\nSebastian remained calm, throughout the warning and angered statements of the ministers. He could now tell that they, indeed, were brainwashed by a certain someone to sound so nonsensical.\n\"If it's about my nation and the Lord I once served, then I am prepared to face any consequences of my actions, Sir Sigmund.\" The butler spoke, without a speck of hesitation.\nTurning his attention toward the King, Sebastian relayed, \"For the next ten minutes, I request everyone to listen to what I have to say before making any judgment.\"\nSeeing him bowing his head, and going against his character, Cedric instantly agreed, \"You have my permission.\"\nSebastian raised his head and started, \"\"Your Majesty, the cook who prepared your meal was not from Eryndor. In fact, he was a resident of White Wing Orphanage in Hener.\"\nAiden's eyes widened as he looked at Sebastian in horror.\nHe made sure that no one found out about that bastard's origin and where he came from...then how?!\nSebastian, while raising his left hand toward the first Prince, added, \"And coincidentally, the orphanage where Sir Aiden has been brought up is also the White Wing Orphanage.\"\n\"What the hell are you trying to imply here?! That Prince Aiden conspired against his own father?!\" The finance minister roared.\nTurning towards the King, he said, \"My Lord, this is enough. You can already tell that the man is trying to frame the First Prince.\" Turning his disdainful eyes toward Austin, he added, \"And considering whom Sebastian serves, you can already tell who is behind it.\"\nAustin smiled, and gave a nod as if saying, 'You got that right.'\n\"Sigmund, as I said, I have given him permission to talk so sit back down and let him say whatever he wants.\" Cedric retorted, his face showing displeasure which caused the Minister to turn stiff.\nI-Is he really believing this?\nAiden clenched his fist....however, he didn't react. He knew that he could still get out of this situation if he held back his emotions and let the man finish whatever he wanted to say.\nSebastian gave a thankful bow to the Supreme Authority before continuing, \"Next, I would like to inform you all about the fact that Sir Aiden has been using his Shard to manipulate your mind and make you believe what he wants to. I only suspected this when Lord Corwon came to the Academy, asking to break the engagement with Young Master Aiden. However, after investigating a little, it turned out that whenever the first Prince conversed with his mother and the minister, he always used his Shard.\"\nThat caused many people to frown. Even Lord Corwon was taken aback by that statement.\nIt was true that when he heard from Aiden, he believed that making Valerie Aiden's fiancée would be for everyone's betterment. However, after meeting his daughter, he realized how foolish that decision was.\n\"If I may, my Lord, I would like to add that indeed, whenever around the first Prince, I could feel the use of magic. But because of my Shard's ability to parry against any of such waves, I never got under its influence.\" Prime Minister Arthur added, \"And that's why it seems I am the only one who isn't under his control.\"\nAiden raised his brows, \"That's...something I am hearing the first time. But let's assume it's true, then why isn't father influenced?\"\nSebastian was rendered speechless since he also didn't have the answer to that.\nAiden thought that he finally had the upper hand, when suddenly,\n\"He was poisoned. And poisons affect one's thinking capability. That's why your Shard didn't manipulate him.\" Austin's clear voice resonated in the royal court.\nCedric's eyes parted slightly, \"Austin...you knew about it too?\"\nAustin nodded, \"Why do you think the same mother who loved me so dearly, hates everything I do now? Because I changed? No, it was because someone brainwashed into her believing that I am worthless and someone who no longer needs his parents' attention.\"\nWhen he said that, Cedric was forced to think about those several occasions when he noticed his wife being too harsh on Austin. Her attention always remained on Aiden, and whenever Cedric even mentioned Austin, she changed the topic.\n....that indeed wasn't normal.\nAiden gritted his teeth. This was getting out of hand.\nTurning the King he voiced, \"You are th-\"\n\"First Prince, I still have a few minutes left.\" Aiden was suddenly interrupted by Sebastian, as the butler smilingly reminded.\nAiden, while barely holding his anger, raised his hand, \"Yes sure, go on.\"\nSebastian gave a thankful nod, before turning towards the current Imperial Legion Commander and Rudolph's father, and said,\n\"Sir Edwin, if I am not wrong you have worked with Sir Harold's ability?\"\nThe tall knight stood up and said, \"Yes, we worked together a few years ago. I know about his Shard's ability.\" Turning towards the King, he added, \"He was the chief of interrogation since his Shard didn't allow anyone to lie.\"\n\"Thank you, Sir Edwin.\" Saying so, Sebastian turned towards the group behind him before nodding\nRudolph pushed the tattered soldier forward followed by Rhea and Harold as they presented the soldiers in the middle of the court.\nHarold wordlessly summoned his Shard before pressing its tip against the ground and drawing a circle around the soldier.\n\"Now, tell me, soldier, what were you doing in the Academy?\" Sebastian asked.\nThe soldier first remained silent, but the moment Rudolph summoned his Shard, he began speaking,\n\"S-Sir Aiden sent me...to check if Sir Austin has reached the academy.\"\nSebastian hummed before asking, \"Were you alone in this?\"\n\"I-I had one comrade...but since we failed to track Sir Austin after he left the capital, Sir Aiden killed my partner.\"\nThat aroused a few gasps from the audience, and the Queen had her eyes widened, too.\n'Why are they framing my son like this?!' She couldn't understand why Sebastian and the others were hell-bent on making Aiden the wrong person here even though he always thinks for the betterment of the family.\nAnd her husband....why is he silent even after hearing all this?\nSebastian hummed, before asking again, \"So were you sent just because Sir Aiden was worried about his brother?\" The butler added before Aiden could have interpreted his intention in another way.\n\"N-N-No...he didn't want the second Prince to be anywhere else, but the a-academy or i-it would have affected his plan on letting Sir Austin get exiled.\"\n\"That's such a blatant lie!\" The chief advisor finally lost his cool, \"Your Majesty, Sebastian is just making things up now and has brought the whole army to conspire against the-*SHLINK*\"\nA blade flew past the Minister, leaving a shallow cut on his cheek, before stabbing into the pillar beside him\nNot only the minister, who was inches away from being stabbed just now, was startled, but even Aiden's eyes widened when he realized whose Shard it was.\nEvery eye turned toward the King, whose eyes were devoid of any other emotion but anger, before they heard his voice, \"I never gave you the permission to speak yet you keep interfering. Have you forgotten what I can do to those who don't listen to my WORDS!\"\nWith the loud roar of the King, the blades began flying around the throne, ready to exterminate the lives of those whom he found worthless.\nEveryone turned silent.\nThis was the first time for many to see the King in such rage.\nMaybe because he doesn't go hunting or hasn't been involved in a war for a long time, people have forgotten the strength Cedric holds.\nThe Chief Advisor didn't dare to utter a single syllable.\nAmidst the growing silence, Cedric turned towards his second son before voicing, \"Austin, step forward.\"\nAustin did as he was told, before he heard the older one asking, \"You were aware of all this? That your brother is keeping an eye on you and the fact that he regularly exchanges letters with the Prime Minister of Hener?\"\nThey caused all the colors from Aiden's face to disappear.\nHe exchanged letters with Hener....how does Cedric know about it?!\nAustin was also amazed that his father was aware of such a thing.\nWith a nod, he responded, \"I knew, father, but I didn't tell you anything because I had no evidence.\"\nCedric narrowed his eyes, \"I still can dismiss all this evidence and declare Aiden not guilty.\"\nAustin shrugged, \"I won't care, in that case, since I have already told you that I don't care about the throne and this family anymore.\"\nGlancing in Aiden's direction, Austin added, \"I only took action because Aiden tried to touch something precious to me....my Val.\" When he said that, Valerie appeared beside him out of nowhere.\nLord Corwon was startled to find that his daughter was also here and was involved in all this.\nRedirecting his gaze towards his father, Austin added, \"And when he poisoned you, I felt that I need to do something or Eryndor will fall along with its King.\"\nCedric's Shard disappeared, and the older one's shoulders lost their strength.\nOnce again...he was reminded of the fact that he had failed his son.\nAnd now, aware of Aiden's true face, he realized that he was a complete failure as a father.\n\"Father.\" Amidst the growing silence, Aiden spoke up, \"I have been blamed for many things, but none of the evidence holds authenticity.\"\nTurning towards Austin, he spoke up, \"Since it would be difficult to prove who is wrong and who is right, let's settle this the old way.\"\nWith his eyes holding nothing but the intention to murder, Aiden spoke, \"Through a battle.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Drop a comment.",

      "content": "In Rhea’s eyes, the First Prince was either foolish or was considering everyone else.\nJust now, every evil deed he has committed was presented before the Supreme Authority. Vice-headmaster Harold also confirmed through his Shard that Aiden, indeed, was stalking Austin and conspiring against him while being in contact with Hener.\nBut despite all the evidence showing him guilty, the bastard wasn’t ready to back off.\nHe actually, proposed a duel against Austin, like this was some kind of debate where one couldn’t get a concrete answer.\nDude, you are proven guilty. Just suck it up and get punished.\n\"What no concrete evidence are you talking about? Didn’t Sir Edwin just confirm the ability Sir Harold possesses? What’s there to talk about now?\" The prime minister voiced.\nWhat was there to prove now? Didn’t the King himself declare that he was aware of Aiden’s connection with Hener?\n\"No, Sir Arthur. I also want this judgment to be declared through a battle.\" Austin suddenly voiced.\nHearing those words, a few gasped while a few smirked.\nEveryone knew that the second Prince was a D-rank and the first Prince was an A-rank…at the very least.\nAiden had a grin on his face as he turned toward the Supreme Authority before declaring, \"Since Austin has given his consent, I believe Father mustn’t have a-\"\n\"I can’t let it happen.\" Cedric instantly cut him off, \"You are a criminal. Someone who was conspiring against Eryndor. You poisoned me and brainwashed everyone into believing things that could have resulted disastrously. And most of all…you tried to harm Austin. And I want no other evidence than Austin’s words to declare you guilty.\"\nAiden’s clenched his fist, as he barked, \"So you won’t even let me prove myself?! You are prioritizing your second son since I grew up away from the home so you consider me as an outsider…like dirt!\"\nValerie frowned hearing those words as she muttered under her breath, \"His stage play is annoying…if only I could-’\n\"Sorry Val, but he is my prey.\"\nValerie was taken aback by the cold whisper as she glanced at her Lord.\nHis eyes were devoid of any emotion. However, someone close to him, Valerie could sense lava of rage boiling within him.\nHolding her hand, he whispered, \"He tried to take you away, and for that sin, I will bestow death upon him by my own hands.\"\nThose words sent a jolt of excitement down her spine while her heart was filled with elation seeing her Lord being so angered for her.\nHe won’t let anyone have her. Valerie only belongs to her Lord~\n\"I won’t let you punish him.\"\nSuddenly, a voice which has been silent until now spoke up.\nThe Queen of Eryndor who used to work as the chief advisor until she became a mother, spoke up, \"I can’t let you punish Aiden. You can’t see it but I have noticed that Austin is framing his brother just because he is not counted in the race for the throne!\"\nEveryone turned silent. Meanwhile, Aiden finally felt that there might still be some hope as he sobbingly voiced, \"Don’t fight for me, mother *Hicc* if father has already called me a criminal, there is no point in saying anything further.\"\nWiping his eyes, Aiden added, \"Send me to the cell and hang me to death-\"\n\"Don’t even utter that word, Aiden!\" Turning toward her husband, she voiced in a loud tone, \"How can you declare him guilty without even listening to him? Deciding everything based on what you heard from Austin and his allies!\"\nThis might be the first time for the Queen to go against her etiquette and speak like this in the middle of the court.\nCedric had a firm stance on this so he didn’t think twice before commanding, \"My decision won’t change even if the God tells me. Aiden would be imprisoned for the crimes he has committed.\"\nIt was not a topic to debate on. Just now, Aiden was suggesting to wage a war against the nation which extended a friendly proposal.\nRisking thousands of lives just because Aiden thinks they can backstab? Cedric would be blind to not realize what the boy was plotting.\nThose mouths that were running in Aiden’s favor have long been silenced since the Supreme Authority has already made up his mind about punishing him.\nSophie narrowed her eyes, as she spat, \"As Queen, I decree that Austin shall never be permitted to claim the throne.\"\nTurning her disdainful eyes toward Austin, she added, \"Let’s see if you can still uphold that confidence now.\"\nYour next on .Côm\nAlthough she was both Austin and Aiden’s mother, she saw Aiden as the victim here and Austin was the biggest sinner at the moment, in her eyes.\nCedric was about to deny her, when suddenly, Austin said, \"You still think I care about the throne?\" There was a smile on his face, a sad one, which made Sophie’s heart tremble for a moment. However, her expression didn’t change and the wordless answer her eyes held was a ’yes’.\nAustin shook his head before turning toward the King and declaring, \"I, Austin von Eryndor, declare here in front of everyone that I won’t ever accept the throne of Eryndor under any circumstances. And that’s my final decision.\"\nValerie’s hold around his hand turned firmer, while a few, including Rhea, gasped at the declaration.\nThis might be the most shocking thing that happened today for many. Even Sebastian looked at his master with his eyes widened, however, the older one couldn’t find any regret in his master’s eyes. At all.\nSophie fell back on her seat because of the shock with her eyes widened.\nShe…couldn’t believe that Austin actually wasn’t doing all this for the throne…was he lying…but he said that in front of so many people…\nWhile the Queen seemed to have received a severe shock, Aiden gritted his teeth as he realized that even the damn woman could save him!\nLooking around, he found the chief advisor and the finance minister were averting their gazes—clearing, not intending to help him here.\nAiden was…once again feeling himself in a corner. Like all those times when he got cornered in the orphanage by the older boys.\nThe same hopelessness he felt when he stood before his first love’s grave.\nThat despair…that helplessness…that fear of losing everything.\nEverything blinded him and in a fit of rage,\n\"DAMN YOU ALL!!!\"\nBefore anyone could react, Aiden summoned his shard in a flash and drove it into the ground with force.\nSHFIUUUUK!\nA deafening crack split the air as a violent shockwave burst forth. Black mist erupted like a storm, twisting and curling as it swallowed the space around him.\nThe soldiers staggered, their bodies trembling as an invisible force drained them of all strength. Their knees buckled. Swords and spears clattered onto the ground, slipping from lifeless fingers. Gasps filled the air, some choking, others collapsing entirely.\nTheir eyes widened in horror. Muscles refused to obey. It felt as if their very souls were being pulled from their bodies.\nAiden’s eyes were red as he used every bit of his soul energy to chant that spell before he turned toward the bastard who caused it all.\nThe asshole who snatched everything from him!\n\"AUSTIN!\" With his Shard raised, Aiden launched toward where Austin was, aiming to slaughter the son of a b*tch!\nHis sword was held horizontally, as he pushed it to stab Austin—but,\n*Clang*\nAiden’s eyes widened as his sword was parried and he was pushed back, \"What the--!\"\nHe gasped….his skill should have worked on everyone. Why the hell a weakling like him was not affected?\nAustin stepped forward, a greenish barrier surrounding him.\nHis eyes were threatening as Austin muttered, \"Calling out your opponent’s name…how lame can you be?\"\nAiden clutched his blade tighter before plunging it forward, \"DAMN YOU!\"\nHowever,\n*CLANG*\n--the blade still didn’t pierce through the barrier.\n\"AAHHHHHH!\"\n*CLANG* *CLANG*\nHe continued to attack, one after another, using all the remaining strength his body could muster…however, none of it worked.\nThe barrier didn’t budge!\n\"Feeling helpless?\" Austin asked, with a tilt of his head.\nAiden’s face was pale, his chest heaving as he stared at the a**wipe, \"Y-You…if only you hadn’t been here…\"\nAustin grinned, \"Oh no, no, I have always been here…the one who made your life hell.\" With a mocking smile, he added, \"The one who sent that noble after Marilyn…do you know who is it?\"\nAiden’s eyes widened…no one knows about Marilyn….then that means, \"Y-You bastard! It was YOU!!!!\"\nWith every ounce of his strength, he swung his sword. Every fiber of his being desired to destroy the trash of a human!\nHowever,\n*CLANG*\nIt didn’t work.\n\"Why…\" Tears welled up in Aiden’s eyes as his grip loosened, the sword slipping from his trembling fingers. His breath hitched as he staggered back, his chest rising and falling in ragged gasps.\n\"Why always me—\"\nSWISH!\n\"Yeah, no.\" Austin’s cold voice cut through the air as he stepped forward, his blade flashing in a swift, merciless arc.\nTHUD.\nAiden’s world twisted. For a fleeting moment, he saw the ground rushing toward him—his own body standing limply in the distance. A strange weightlessness took hold as darkness swallowed his senses.\nAustin shook his head as he swatted his Shard and told his dear elder brother, \"Committing crime just because life has been unfair to you? Yeah, you are lame.\"\nWith that, Eryndor lost its first Prince.\n-----**-----\nA/N:- Drop a comment.",

      "content": "Everything happened in a flash after that.\nThe very fact that Aiden launched a spell that dulled everyone’s senses in the royal court was a grave crime. Under that spell, he could have harmed anyone, including the King—and that’s exactly what Austin showed everyone by placing Aiden’s headless body in such a manner that it seemed that he intended to attack the king.\nNaturally, it wasn’t the case but since everyone was in a daze, no one noticed.\nAbout the thing he said about Marilyn? Well, that definitely was a lie. Austin transmigrated quite late in the story, and the previous owner didn’t know anything about Aiden about his previous life when he used to live in slums.\nAustin just wanted to harm Aiden; both physically and mentally.\nIn reality, Austin wanted to torture the piece of crap more. He wanted to take his sweet time to slowly pluck each of his limbs, then slowly take out both of his eyes, then slice off that tongue, and then…but his wishes didn’t come true because the effect of the spell was wearing down.\nSince Austin would have been prohibited from killing Aiden if others had regained their senses, he had to finish the job instantly. And now, he can only live in regret for not being able to painfully kill that being who dared raise his eyes toward his beloved.\nAnd now, things were slowly getting back on track—or so Austin hoped.\n...\n\"Young master…are you sure we should leave tomorrow?\"\nAs they advanced toward Austin’s room, Sebastian asked worryingly.\nRead latest chapters at .Côm\nAustin told him and Valerie that they would be leaving tomorrow, early morning.\nValerie was currently with her father and the other who came from the academy are staying in the palace as well—they will also return tomorrow morning.\n\"The tournament officially begins the day after tomorrow, and I need to be there tomorrow anyhow or I would be disqualified.\" Austin casually responded. However, his casual demeanor worried the older one.\nSebastian clearly seemed quite distressed because of whatever happened today.\nThe most hurtful thing Austin faced today was those words from the Queen—the lady who gave birth to him was blatantly calling him a criminal today.\nAnyone, regardless of how detached they seem to their family, would be quite shaken by being hated by their parents.\nHowever, the way Austin seemed completely unbothered, worried the older one.\nReaching the room where Austin was staying, the blond Prince turned to look at the person whom he cared about the most after Valerie.\n\"Sebas…I know you are worried about me, however, trust me, it doesn’t bother me what my mother said. It’s a fact that she gave birth to me…and that cannot be changed by anyone, but if she wants to sever all relations from me, I or you can do nothing about it. So, let’s just move on and think about the future.\"\nSebastian heaved a sigh, his eyes fixed on the young man whom he had seen going through several phases. Although, he has changed quite a lot. He no longer whines and complains about every single thing but rather accepts everything with a mature front.\nBut sometimes…Sebastian misses that version of Austin who never held back his emotions.\nWith a smile, the man muttered, \"If you need something, call me, sir.\"\n-----*----\nValerie was in the front garden with her father as the duo walked slowly side by side.\nThere were several things on Adam’s mind, however, the thing he focused on was his daughter, as he said, \"You were with Austin and not in the Academy. Even went to Drenovar and fought for them.\"\nValerie casually muttered, \"Mother taught me to support my Lord.\"\nAdam side-glanced his daughter before uttering, \"You aren’t married to him yet you…\"\n\"No one can understand our relationship.\" She coldly responded before he could have made any rash comment.\nIt could be sensed that Valerie was still quite mad at her father….because of what happened last time between them.\nAdam heaved a sigh before he stopped before his daughter and told her, \"Look, Val…I was wrong. I shouldn’t have brought that up…however, can you blame me? That bastard used a skill on me and I got manipulated.\" The man generally doesn’t use cuss words, however, if he sounds hateful toward the man his daughter is disgusted with…he would probably get forgiven.\nRight?\nValerie narrowed her gaze as she stated, \"Austin told me the application of that skill. Unless one has subtle feelings about something, Aiden wouldn’t have been able to exploit it. Which means, you actually thought that Austin isn’t worthy of me.\"\nAdam’s mouth was parted in shock, but just as he saw his daughter walking away, he hurriedly voiced, \"B-But can you blame me? You are the only child I have and someone who holds the potential to register her name in the golden book of history. On the other hand, all I have seen that brat-\" Valerie glared at him, which made the man falter,\n\"-T-that boy do all his life is to get jealous of your achievements.\"\nValerie crossed her arms on her bosom as she said, \"But is he like that?\"\nAdam instantly shook his head, \"He has changed, I can see. He cares about you and his personality has taken quite a massive turn as well. Now, I can proudly call him my son-in-law, hahaha!\"\nSeeing the subtle smile appearing on his daughter’s face, the man knew that he was heading in the right direction, so he added, \"How about you bring him home someday? Your mother really wants to meet her son-in-law, too.\"\nValerie lowered her gaze as she muttered, \"I will ask him. Now, father, you should go and rest.\"\nAdam smilingly nodded; at least she called him ’father’ softly.\nAs the man turned around and began walking out of the palace, he couldn’t help but think,\n’What a day has come….I had to use Austin’s name to gain my daughter’s forgiveness….such a cruel world.’\n--------**--------\nA/N:- Another chapter maybe, before we return to the academy and continue with the plot.\nThanks for reading.",

There was no one but the three—who came from the academy—present on the dining table.\nAll the other members were in their room. Naturally, what has happened today, they would need some time to collect their thoughts.\n\"It was…pure madness. I could have never thought that the First Prince would be like that.\" Rudolph voiced followed by a weary sigh.\nHis father used to praise Aiden a lot in the past, and after Rudolph sparred against Aiden a couple of times, he also realized that he was a good man.\nIn the past, whenever Austin said anything against his elder brother, Rudolph thought that he was just jealous. However, now…\n\"Truth be told when I heard things from the soldier, I didn’t think that things would be that messed up. However, after arriving here and after hearing from Sir Sebastian, I realized that I was underestimating him. He truly was a low life.\"\nRhea muttered with a disdainful look on her face.\n\"Yeah…just think about it. He actually manipulated his parents and the council members. Her Majesty is in a critical condition now because of him.\"\nThe queen collapsed after she saw Aiden’s dead body. When the medic checked on her, it turned out that rather than the shock it was the sudden disconnection of Shard’s ability that caused severe backslash to her mind.\nIt would take some time for her to recover since everything related to one’s mind needs critical attention.\nRhea remained silent for a brief moment, before she uttered, \"Parkinson’s parents…asked His Majesty to abandon Austin so they can hunt him down.\"\nRudolph’s expression turned grim, \"Do you think they proposed it to take revenge?\"\nRhea looked at him with an exasperated look, \"What else do you think? And in my opinion, it must be Parkinson himself who must have asked them to somehow harm Austin that brought that proposal.\"\nWith her fist clenched, Rhea muttered under her breath, ’You are no better than Aiden…just pray we never come across each other.’\n------^^------\nAustin was inside his room, lying down on his bed, thinking back on whatever had happened in these few days.\nHe went to Drenovar and made and changed many plans before something unexpected but fortunate for him showed up, allowing Austin to gain what he came for.\nThen he returned home, with the intention to just share the good news and threatened the bastard about his position as the crown prince. He wanted to take this a bit longer since Austin didn’t have any evidence to prove Aiden guilty and let the world know his true face. Continue your journey on .Côm\nHowever, call it coincidence or his good luck, Rhea and the others also arrived at the same time, with walking evidence against Aiden beside them.\nWhatever Sebastian proposed in the court was completely unexpected. Austin didn’t know when but the older one had already sensed Aiden’s true personality and intentions.\n’Well, whatever happened is for good…’ His decision to never become the next king came because of two reasons—first because he doesn’t want to get tied down by the throne. That would surely restrict his movements, and become an obstacle in his preparation for the final war.\nThe second was…his mourning soul which was slightly affected by those scornful eyes of the lady whom he considered his mother for a long time.\n’Was I really sad at that time…’ Austin heaved a sigh as he closed his eyes.\nMaybe a part of him was actually hurt at that time…facing those scornful eyes and those hate-laced words.\n’Haah…well, can’t fight it…’ Deciding to change the topic, Austin asked the system,\n’Show me my stats,’ He hasn’t checked it ever since he returned from death.\n[Ding!]\n[Combat: 45-> 63/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[Ding!]\n[You have gained one reward!]\n[Romance: 51->58/100]\n{Next reward at 60}\n[Durability: 57->68/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[Ding!]\n[You have gained a reward!]\n[Trickery: 31/100]\n{Next reward at 35}\n[Overall Progression: 44->53.5/100]\n[Next Reward at 70]\n[Ding!]\n[You have unlocked a reward!]\n…\nAustin was taken aback by that absurd growth in his stats.\n’System…?’\n[In the short duration during which you fought the Great Demon, your stats significantly rose, and when the berserk mode wore off, some stats received a significant boost.]\n’Damn…’ He couldn’t have imagined that facing death from that close would allow him to fill the overall progression by half.\nAnd the three rewards were the icing on the cake.\nThe overall progression provides some sick rewards, which explains why Austin seemed so excited.\nHe was about to check the rewards, when suddenly,\n*CLINK* *CLINK*\nSomeone knocked on his window, ushering Austin to turn his head…only to find his beloved somehow hanging by the window sill.\nAustin hurried toward the window before opening it for her, \"Thank you…\" She muttered before jumping inside.\n\"You could have come through the door, y’know. This isn’t the dorms after all.\"\nValerie’s lashes fluttered while her cheeks adapted redness, as she said, \"Visiting my fiancée at this hour would have…caused numerous rumors…\"\nAustin grinned as he encircled his arms around her slender waist before whispering, \"I welcome every rumor that keeps Austin and Valerie’s name connected.\"\nValerie blushed even more furiously as she suddenly felt her legs turned wobbly.\n\"This…I baked this for you.\"\nShe suddenly showed him the bag of cookies she brought along.\n\"Hmm? Did you bake them now? What was the rush?\" Austin could tell that the cookies were still warm.\nValerie directed her upturned gaze in his direction before whispering, \"I heard sweet things heal wounded hearts.\"\nAustin was taken aback by that statement, as he looked at his lover with his eyes slightly widened, \"You…think…I am sad?\"\nValerie slowly nodded in assent.\n…it was strange…that without asking him or talking to him, she realized that he was sad. Even though he tried so hard to not let others know about it…\n’Nothing can remain hidden to the one who loves you…’\nAustin suddenly smiled before he took out one of the cookies and bit it.\nMaybe yeah...he was indeed sad.\nValerie was about to ask something, when suddenly,\n*Knock*\n\"Austin…can we talk?\"\nIt was his father.\n-------^^------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

Good night, bye.’ And to prevent Austin from feeling grumpy, she even gave a kiss on his cheek before running away.\nHe definitely will take revenge for that quick kiss.

Did you need something?\"\nCedric looked quite tired, and his face slightly pale, so Austin first invited him inside, and after offering him a seat, he gave him a glass of water.\n\"Thank you,\" Cedric thanked his son, as Austin sat down across from him.\nAustin waited patiently since it was apparent that the man wanted to talk about something.\nAfter a few minutes of silence, Cedric finally began, \"You remember that day...when you ran away from your birthday party because you got no gifts while your brother received numerous presents?\"\nAustin chuckled, \"How can I forget that.\" Later Valerie came chasing after him—with a present in her hand.\nHowever, Austin was so exasperated at that time that he thought that she brought that present for Aiden, but was pitying him by giving him the present instead.\nHe threw away the present even without bothering to look at what she brought.\n’Truly a scumbag...’ Smiling in self-mockery, he decided to apologize to his beloved tomorrow.\n\"At that time...your mother actually prepared a few gifts for you. She didn’t want you to feel lonely, that’s why she named those presents from different people. However, seeing your behavior, she instead gave all the presents to Aiden.\"\nAustin was slightly surprised, \"Are you trying to make things up or provoking me to hate her even more?\"\nCedric shook his head as he muttered, \"I am just relaying that your mother didn’t forget about you; rather, it was Aiden’s Shard that changed her slowly. He made her think that you have already enjoyed your portion of familial warmth.\"\nAustin leaned back, his brows elevated as he asked, \"You do know that unless she didn’t actually have that thought, Aiden couldn’t have used his Shard to manipulate her, right?\"\n\"I am aware, and trust me, son, I am not here to speak in support of her actions. However, as her husband, I want to apologize for whatever she has caused.\"\nA king he is, yet he didn’t think twice before bowing his head.\nAnd for what? For the love of his life.\nAustin can relate to that feeling...however, \"Look, Father, even if I forgive her, I hardly believe she would ever see my face after what I have caused.\"\nWith a soft sigh, he added, \"What do you think, just because Aiden is gone, she will suddenly get up and embrace me? I hardly believe it.\"\nAlthough the Shard was gone, the deep-seated hatred must have left some effect on the Queen. As such, Austin believed that she was going to blame him for the rest of her life.\nIn his mind, Austin has already accepted the fact that he has no mother.\nNot anymore.\nWith a soft smile, which made the man appear older than usual, Cedric muttered, \"I won’t ask you anything more if you just don’t reject her if she ever approaches you with the intention of making things up.\"\nAustin exhaled a long breath. He didn’t think that was ever going to happen; however, seeing the tired man barely holding himself together, he couldn’t bring himself to reject it.\n\"Okay, I understand.\"\nThe man soon got up and asked, \"The tournament starts the day after tomorrow, right?\"\nAustin also got up before he nodded, \"Yeah.\"\n\"I will come to watch your matches.\" The man spoke with a sense of pride in his voice. He hasn’t even congratulated his son properly for qualifying for such a grant tournament.\nAustin’s brows drew closer as he said, \"Don’t you have things to settle with Drenovar? Don’t waste your time on the tournament and focus on administration.\"\nCedric scratched the gap between his brows as he said, \"Right...Drenovar.\" Looking up, he said, \"I didn’t hear from you what happened back there....and you are already leaving tomorrow.\" The sorrow in his voice was palpable.\nAustin stepped closer to the man before resting his hand on his shoulder and said, \"This is my home, father, so surely I will return. What’s the rush?\"\nCedric’s eyes widened slightly as he looked at his son.\nHe didn’t know why, but all the stress Cedric was carrying was washed away by that single statement.\nSeeing tears in his eyes, Austin smiled helplessly, before he stepped closer and hugged the man, \"Now stop crying. It doesn’t suit a grown-up man.\"\nCedric didn’t remember when was the last time he hugged his child.\nHe has already lost all his hope to ever unite this family; however...there might still be some hope.\n°°°°°°°\nAfter Cedric left, Austin sat back down on the bed.\nThe man seemed much like a certain someone from his past life—an old man, Luke used to meet in the evening in a park where he went for a run.\nThe old man was left alone by his son and daughter-in-law and used to live in an old age home.\nHe used to miss his family and grandchildren a lot—and since the resting bench of the park faced the city streets, he always sat there—hoping that one day maybe his son come back to meet him\nHowever, that day never arrived and the old man died while waiting.\nAnd today when Austin saw the King crying, he saw that old man in him.\nAlthough he wasn’t able to do anything for the old man, at least he could try and assure his father.\n’Haah...family relations are quite complicated.’\nSince it was quite late, Austin dropped the plan of meeting Valerie and changed his clothes.\nTurning off the lights, he called out, ’System, show me my rewards.’\nHe would be joining the tournament as an Elite and would be representing his academy.\nTo not embarrass himself and Valerie, Austin needs to utilize every single weapon he has in his arsenal.\n[Ding!]\n[Upon crossing a certain threshold in Durability, the host gets rewarded with:\n[Adaptive Flesh: Heals minor injuries and enhances endurance against common poisons.]\n[Note: The ability would develop with time and repetitive use.]\n[Note: There is no limitation on the skill usage.]\nAustin nodded in appreciation—that surely is helpful. Kinda feels like a skill belonging to a certain GOAT character.\n’Well, I hope the skill develops and heal major wounds as well...’ The enemies he would be facing surely would inflict regular damage. And overdosing on potions was not good for health.\n’Okay, next.’\n[Ding!]\n[Upon crossing a certain threshold in combat, the host gains:\n[Berserk: Enhances host’s stats by five times.]\n[Limitation: Can be used once after seven hours of complete rest.]\n[Note: Skill can be upgraded to amplify the host’s stats more.]\n[Note: Since the host used the skill before, the skill is locked for ten days.]\nAustin’s excitement turned into surprise, as he asked, ’What the heck with that prohibition?’\n[The host used the Berserk skill at a much higher level to defeat the Great Demon; the system has to lock it so no significant damage is sustained on the Host’s body.]\nAustin scratched his head—what the heck is this system?\nWell, since it saved his life, Austin didn’t complain for long.\nAt that time, if he had lost his life, none of this would have mattered.\nHeaving a sigh, he asked, ’And the last one?’\n[Ding!]\n[Upon crossing a certain threshold in your overall progression, the host has gained:\n[Resonant Bond: Allows host to temporarily synchronize with one’s soul and let him use their Shard.]\n[Note: The difference in levels of the host and the target shouldn’t be more than one.]\n[Limitation: Can only be used for three minutes]\nYour adventure continues at .Côm\n[Limitation: Can only be used once in three days.]\n[Note: The skill duration can be increased with dungeon points or the Host’s stats progression.]\n\"....\" Austin was rendered speechless as he read the description of the skill again and again\nOne’s Shard is the essence of one’s soul—something that cannot be used by anyone other than to whom it belongs.\nIt is the basic textbook knowledge that ever awakened knows.\nAnd here, Austin gained an ability to defy the very basic law...crazy.\n’System...so I can only sync with someone who is a level above me?’\n[Indeed, host. However, there is no lower limit. The Host can sync with anyone who is on a lower level than the host.]\n’Damn....’ That was some crazy ability. Just thinking about how he could have used Drenovar’s prince’s shield against the demon, made him feel itchy all over.\n’You are the best, system!’\n[Love you too, host.]\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Ayoooooo.

      "content": "There are ten seats in councils, the ten heads that run the Union Council.\nThese leaders change every ten years, so even if one of them fails to meet the expectations of the masses, they will eventually be replaced. The newly appointed ruler will then have the opportunity to implement improvements and address any shortcomings.\nThe Union Council serves as the backbone of humanity, providing assurance that any activity from the demonic side will be met with swift retaliation.\nJust like how recently the report came from Drenovar about the appearance of Hellstain.\nThe Union Council deployed its soldiers to handle the situation. While they had no intention of interfering in the conflict between Drenovar and Eryndor, the involvement of demons necessitated their support for the nation.\nHowever, something unexpected happened, and a demonic army, under the guidance of a Demon general, attacked Drenovar out of nowhere.\nAlthough no civilians were harmed in the attack, hundreds of soldiers and a few Council officers fell prey to the demonic creatures.\nThe moment they received the message that a small army of Demonic beasts had ambushed, the council sent one of their best soldiers and an S-rank for the rescue.\nIt would have taken the soldier a few hours to reach Drenovar, and his presence alone would have been formidable enough to drive away the threat.\nHowever, by the time the soldier arrived at the scene, the demonic army had vanished without a trace, and the Great Demon from the Hellstain had been reduced to ashes.\nLater while investigating, it turned out that two people became the reason for Drenovar’s survival.\nTwo people; one expected and one not.\n\"It’s still unclear why Valerie Corwon was in Drenovar. And at the precise time when the Demonic army attacked.\" One of the Council Heads, a man with wavy black hair and thin-framed glasses, stated.\n\"The king of Drenovar himself confirmed that he invited the duo to his country to discuss things about truce…but considering the second Prince’s reputation, it is highly likely that Majesty Idris was lying.\" Another member, this time a woman spoke as she rested her hands on the table.\nThey maintain records on the noble families of every nation, as well as key individuals they must monitor. Just as they possess extensive knowledge about Valerie Corwon—who has been on their target list for some time. As an S-rank, she has already proven herself valuable enough to serve the Council.\nPeople die to work here, and that girl rejected their offer from the front, saying she wasn’t capable of shouldering such a massive responsibility.\nThe council is silent until she graduates from the academy. After that, she definitely would be brought in to become a member of the council.\n\"They are lying but we can do nothing about it. Calling her for interrogation is needless since Valerie Corwon would repeat the same lie. And to summon her just for this would sour our relationship.\" Another member voiced and several heads nodded in agreement.\nThey have to treat every matter relating to a high-ranking warrior very carefully.\n\"Then how would you explain the situation with Austin? That boy, who was assessed to be a D-rank, suddenly gets up one day and defeats a Great Demon?\" The one with glasses spoke again as he picked up the report he received about Austin’s assessment.\nIt was hard to believe that a boy who had yet to go through his first evolution to defeat a Great Demon, who—despite being an inexperienced monster—was at least an A-rank.\nAlthough he had the support of Drenovar’s first prince, even with that it was nearly impossible for them to defeat the Demon on their own.\nAnd not only that, those who witnessed the battle from afar, said that Austin overwhelmed the demon at some point.\n\"This is suspicious. He even defeated a B-rank cadet recently to secure a position as an Elite in the tournament.\" Another officer added, which added another point to make people focus on the blond young noble. Find your next adventure on .Côm\n\"Do you think he is involved with the other side?\" Someone asked in a grave tone.\nThe other side in question was, naturally, the demonic side.\nThey have come across cases when humans, sometimes willingly and sometimes not, consume the Dark Water and get a significant boost in their magic and physical capabilities.\nAll the signs indicated that Austin was as well, involved with something inhumane.\n\"Should we bring him in for interrogation?\" Someone raised the suggestion. Naturally, in front of their lie detection tool, not even a demonic human would be able to lie.\nThey were thinking and preparing their decisions when suddenly a soldier knocked on the door before stepping inside,\n\"Excuse me, Generals, but there are two urgent news the administrative department wanted to relay.\"\nOne of the ten gestured for the soldier to speak.\nThe soldier began, \"The first Prince of Eryndor, Aiden von Eryndor, was accused of poisoning his father, the king, and later he was killed by his brother in court.\"\nThat elicited a look of surprise from a few while a few frowned.\nIf they hadn’t been talking about Austin just now, they wouldn’t have reacted so strongly.\nNow, most of them were convinced that bringing Austin for interrogation was quite necessary.\n\"What’s the second news?\" Someone asked before the soldier delivered the news which was far more shocking than the previous one,\n\"Madam Selner has summoned Valerie Corwon and Austin von Eryndor for questioning, a week later.\"\nThat caused many to gasp and many had their eyes widened.\nAs mentioned previously, the ten members always change after a certain period. However, there is a certain member of the council who might not be a part of the board but is still as important as them.\nSomeone who has been an advisor of the Council Board for decades. Someone whose words they never question.\nThe longest serving member of the council and someone who generally doesn’t interfere with regular matters like this.\nHowever, since she had voiced her wish, there was no one who could go against her wish.\n\"Proceed as commanded.\"\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- This was bound to happen, considering Austin’s unnatural growth.",

They must arrive by evening, or even the vice headmaster won’t be able to prevent their names from being removed from the list.\nThe rules of the council were absolute.\n\"Ready to depart?\" Austin asked as he stood near his horse and softly rubbed her mane.\nRudolph yawned, stretching his body a little as he said, \"Kind of. It’s not regular for me to wake up this early now.\"\nAfter joining the academy, Rudolph has become a little lax in his training. After all, when he used to live with his family, his father never allowed him to stray from his routine.\nAustin’s left brow went up, \"That attitude might cost a loss during the tournament.\"\nRudolph smirked, \"You don’t need to worry about that. Even if I have reduced my early morning training, I generally train more before and after dinner. Now, I have a sparring partner as well, who doesn’t allow me to slack off.\" Find more to read at .Côm\nSaying so, Rudolph looked at the back entrance of the palace, and he found Rhea stepping out with Valerie beside her\nAlthough they were walking side by side, neither of them spoke a single word. Rhea was visually nervous and Valerie just maintained her usual demeanor.\n\"They are here.\" Austin turned to look at the duo as Rudolph said.\nA smile bloomed on Austin’s face, seeing his beloved early in the morning.\nShe was wearing a different set of clothes— tight-fitting brown pants with a matching pair of boots. She has a white shirt with frills around her collar and has tied her hair in a ponytail for a comfortable journey.\nHer overall appearance made her appear quite refreshing and stunning to him.\nValerie blushed slightly, the previous cold look evaporating as she looked down with her feet slowly coming to a halt before her man.\n\"Talk about flirting with eyes....\" Rhea passingly commented as she made her way towards her horse.\nIgnoring the comment, Austin cupped his beloved’s cheek, before asking, \"Did you hand a good rest? If you can’t sleep well, we can ride the same horse, and you can relax en route?\"\nValerie’s back turned stiff, her mind instantly forming the image of her snuggling close to Austin, with her face against his chest and his warmth all around him.\nHowever, before she could have said anything, \"Won’t that slow us down? I mean, carrying Valerie together with you surely would require you to be cautious while riding.\" Rudolph instantly extinguished the bubbling heat within her.\n\"...\" Rudolph felt the chillness around him suddenly elevating as he rubbed his hands together and said, \"Anyways, it’s up to you. See ya.\" Making a quiet retreat he went to chat with Rhea.\nValerie was disappointed but she also knew that what Rudolph was saying was true.\n\"He is right...we need to reach the Academy as soon as possible.\" In the end, she had to hold back her desires for the sake of the tournament. The damn tournament.\nAustin smiled at her disappointed reaction before he whispered, \"Don’t worry, once we return, I will cuddle you as long as you want. No one will come between us~\"\n\"...!!\" Valerie was now fully awake.\n\"Young master, good morning.\" Soon the two older men also arrived by their side.\nAustin greeted the duo before turning towards Sebastian, \"Everything ready? Should we leave?\"\nSebastian hesitantly nodded, before he spoke, \"Actually, young master, your father asked me to wake him up before we leave...however, considering how tired he was, I couldn’t bring myself to wake him up.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"You did the right thing. And anyway, the old man would likely visit the tournament venue to see me, so no point in being worried.\"\nSebastian smiled at that before they all decided that delaying anymore would cost them a lot.\n\"Austin and you all, stay behind me. I know a few shortcuts.\" Just as they climbed their horses, Harold suddenly spoke.\nAustin nodded, not suspecting the man one bit in this matter.\nTheir unexpected trip to the capital came to an end as the six of them departed.\n....\nWhat none of them noticed was a single figure standing by the window, looking at them—or to be more precise, at Austin from the moment he appeared in the open.\nSoon, a man appeared behind the woman, and he asked, \"You could have gone to say goodbye.\"\nCedric softly spoke to his wife.\nHe...actually didn’t know what would have happened if Sophie actually had gone to bid farewell to Austin. However, after he heard from Austin last night, the man was somehow positive that something good would come out if the mother approached her son.\nSophie bit her lips, her eyes trembling for a moment before she shook her head and walked back to the bed.\nHer mind was too chaotic at the moment, and she knew if she kept thinking about Austin, she would end up recalling what happened yesterday.\nAnd at the moment, Sophie wasn’t ready to face the reality. Not at all.\nCedric heaved a sigh, seeing his wife in that state.\nThe healers said that they would continuously monitor her, and there would be some frequent fluctuation of emotions she would face these following days.\nThat’s why, the man was quite careful with his words and wasn’t pushing her to do or say something.\nHe has already lost his one son because of what mistake he made all those years ago...now, he doesn’t want to lose his wife, too.\nCrossing his arms, he looked back—his eyes redirecting toward the route from where they left, as he muttered under his breath,\n’I wish you the best of luck for your future ventures.

Don’t be late.\"\nSince there were two hours left Rhea said, \"I will go and freshen up. Too sweaty.\" Her shoulders slumped and her eyes appeared droopy, making her seem adorable.\nRudolph didn’t miss the chance to pinch her cheek, making Rhea grumble but too weak to fight him, before he said, \"Take an hour of nap as well. I will come wake you up.\"\nRhea sneered, \"Even if it’s you, it is impossible for you to breach the security and fool our dorm warden.\"\nWhen she said that, Austin turned stiff momentarily…he easily bypassed the security with his fiancée’s help and reached her room. Well, not like he was going to tell them.\n\"Young master, should I prepare the bath for you?\" Sebastian suddenly asked.\nAustin shook his head, \"You are tired too, rather you go and take a bath first in my room and take rest.\" The bathroom in Austin’s office, where Sebastian stays, has a very small bathroom and barely anyone can relax while taking a bath there.\nThe older one smiled—meaning he wasn’t going to—before he bid farewell and moved toward the male dorms.\nAustin sighed before he turned toward Valerie…who was strangely holding the mare that Austin was riding.\n\"What happened?\" Austin smilingly asked.\n\"She is just too fond of you, hush.\" She drove the mare away before turning her focus to her Lord, \"Are you tired?\"\nAustin tilted his head, stretching his neck slightly as he said, \"Some soreness but not too much. Will probably get back in shape by tomorrow…hmm?\" Austin’s brows elevated as he saw his beloved’s face turning red for some reason.\n\"Everything good?\"\nHe asked which caused the girl to panic, \"Y-Y-Yes…I-I am c-c-co-completely fine…\"\nAustin didn’t know why but Valerie appeared really shy about something.\nWell, if only he had a mind-reading skill, he would have been blushing as well.\nThe duo also decided to head back to their rooms and relax for the time being.\nAustin was, actually, quite tired after the journey. Although his endurance has increased, it would take some time for him to get used to riding horses.\nHowever, this time he didn’t make any foolish mistake by entering a dungeon to relax a bit. That was one lame idea at that time.\n*Click*\nEntering the room, he breathed a long breath of relief.\nHome sweet home.\nAlthough he has been living here for like a little over one month, he has gotten quite fond of this place.\nThe bed in the capital was too comfortable and without his Valerie, it felt quite empty.\nGetting rid of his sweaty clothes, he opened the door of the bathroom and found that Sebastian had already prepared the bath.\nThe hot steam coming out of the bathing pool invited his whole being to dive in it, and as such, he didn’t hold back.\n\"Haah~\" A loud exhale of relief escaped his throat as Austin finally found his sore and uncomfortable body, attaining some comfort.\nHis muscles and bones felt like they were in heaven, and his mind gained some much-needed relief.\nResting his neck against the bundle-up towel, he closed his eyes and enjoyed the bath.\nA lot has happened in these few days. Although it cannot be said that he didn’t expect such a long and tiring journey, to think he would get rid of that plague named Aiden during this short trip was completely unexpected.\nUnexpected but welcomed.\nHe had to get rid of Aiden somehow, so it’s all good.\nHe also got to realize how strong the system was when Austin nearly got killed by the demon but was saved by the miraculous ability of the system\nUsing the skills and boosts Austin would receive in the future...somehow, it sounded overpowered but problematic at the same time.\nImagine having the ability to face immense heat but because his body already used it, Austin would be left defenseless.\n\"No...I shouldn’t put myself into such a danger in the first place.\" The only way the system would use that emergency protocol is when the host’s life gets threatened.\nSo, if he always plans his battle then the system wouldn’t get the opportunity. Find more chapters on .Côm\nThinking about it, Austin asked, \"Can you list all the abilities I have gained from the system?\"\n[Ding!]\n[Preparing the date:\nSkills:\n•Absolute Barrier\n•Aqua Lungs\n•Berserk\n•Resonant Bond\n•Adaptive Flesh\n•Adapt\n•Kinetic Discharge]\nAustin hummed. He has gained quite many skills from the system in this short while. And all of them are quite useful.\nNot to talk about all the artifacts he gained over time. Some of them he hasn’t even used until now.\nHowever, he has a feeling that really soon he will need to rummage his inventory.\n’Let’s go and get ready for now.’\n°°°°°°\nAround five, Austin walked out of his room, all freshened up and wearing the usual uniform of the academy.\n\"Good evening, Young Master. Would you like to have some tea?\" Outside his room, Sebastian stood. He was about to knock when suddenly Austin stepped out.\nAustin shook, \"Although I am quite tempted, I need to reach the ceremonial hall. See you later, Sebas.\"\n\"Take care, young lord.\"\nBidding farewell, Austin stepped out of the dormitory and found several students heading toward the ceremonial hall—which was built on the left side of the main building.\nAustin thought to reach the hall and wait for Valerie, but then, after taking a few steps, he found his girl standing near the fountain—the exact same place where she waits for him every morning in that same uniform.\nMaybe because he saw her in that dress after a long time, Austin felt his heart rate going up a bit.\nAlthough the sweat-bathed Valerie was a sight for sore eyes, this freshly out-of-bath Valerie, who had done slight makeup and braided her hair, also appeared quite lovely.\n\"Sorry for making you wait.\" He called out as he approached the girl.\n\"I also arrived just now.\" She said that but Austin hardly believed that to be true.\nOnce, he came an hour before their appointment time and found her waiting for him. Although he forbade her from punishing herself like this, he doesn’t think that she has changed.\n\"You look quite lovely. You painted your nails? They look gorgeous.\"\nValerie blushed, she didn’t think he would notice it right away.\nAs a warrior, she doesn’t prefer to paint her nails and use her time to do makeup. However, since today she had time and she wanted to impress her Lord, she applied light nail paint.\n\"Thank you...\" With a smile that made him feel more comfortable than the bath he had, she spoke.\nThey soon departed together, heading towards the ceremonial hall with their hands connected.\nOnly those students who had been selected as participants in the tournament were invited to the gathering.\nAustin met by several gazes—the news regarding Aiden must have reached them by now.\nSome were whispering, and some were nudging their friends before signaling toward the couple with their eyes.\nValerie and Austin were at the center of their attention. However, as usual, they ignored everyone and found themselves in a corner.\nAustin looked at the food counter before he said, \"Wait here, I will bring something for you.\"\nValerie nodded, and just as Austin stepped away from her, someone approached the girl.\n\"Hello, there.\"\nThe violet-haired turned towards the girl and greeted her, \"Good evening, President.\"\nIt was the student council president and Valerie’s senior.\nMeanwhile, Austin went towards the food counters and took a small plate before he filled it with some muffins and sour and salty chips.\n\"Got a vibrant taste.\" Someone called out.\nWithout lifting his eyes from the food, Austin nonchalantly spoke, \"Need to keep things balanced, after all.\"\nMorkel chuckled, \"But I heard you threw your brother completely off the balance with your Shard.\"\nAustin shared the laugh, \"Well, he surely saw the world off-balance for a couple of moments.\"\nAnyone who would have understood what they were talking and laughing about might have been creeped out. They are laughing at a dead man!\nMorkel tilted his head as he asked, \"I fulfilled my role, and now I expect that you will too.\"\nAustin nodded, \"I remember. Tomorrow, before we leave, I will give you the names. Don’t worry.\"\nAustin soon filled the plate and returned to his lover.\nMorkel turned his gaze and settled it on a certain pink-head who was currently surrounded by many students.\n’Just a few days...and I will help you take your revenge.’\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

He actually had no idea that she was taught by a Count.\n\"Seriously, dude, you remain lovey-dovey with her all the time, and you know nothing about your girl?\" With a teasing grin, he asked, \"If you ever regret choosing him, Valerie, I am always open-\"\nThat sentence never finished as the tip of a spear pressed against Elion’s chest, and the guy instantly raised his hands, \"Joking. Don’t take it seriously.\"\nAlthough the boy said that, looking at those frosty eyes, he knew he had offended the girl so Elion made a quick retreat.\nSilence descended between the two—making Valerie nervous that that idiot had offended her Lord\nThe only reason she even responded to him was that Elion was the son of her teacher. If anyone else, she would have driven them away instantly.\nShe was thinking of resuming their chat somehow, when suddenly,\n\"May I have your attention, please? The Headmaster wants to relay a few words.\" The Vice-headmaster appeared on the stage, all well-dressed now, and gathered everyone’s attention\nValerie and Austin also turned towards the man who soon appeared on the stage—wearing a crisp black suit and matching tie.\nSilence ensued in the ceremonial hall, as everyone heard the man,\n\"Tomorrow, we all will leave for the venue where the Tournament will be taking place. You all must have received the schedule, but for those who were not able to check it, I must inform you that every student must gather at the front gate by five o’clock.\"\nWith his hands still crossed behind his back, the supreme authority added, \"Lastly, I don’t need to remind you of the importance this tournament holds—not just for your personal records, but for the honor of this Academy. You all know the legendary names that have risen through this very stage. The glory earned here is once in a lifetime—a golden opportunity that may never come again.\nWith his gaze sweeping across the students, he continued, \"There are no second chances. When you step into that arena and stand before your opponent, that moment is all you have. Make it count. Fight as if your name depends on it—because it does.\"\nA sudden rush of motivation and excitement rang through the hall.\nEvery student’s eyes shone with courage and enthusiasm.\nSoon, everyone resumed their chatting. However, this time, it was more focused on the tournament and their planning.\nStepping down from the podium, Philius made his way through the students, nodding towards those who greeted him and walked straight towards Austin and Valerie.\n\"Good evening, sir.\" Austin greeted the older one.\nPhilius looked quite tense about something as he said, \"After dinner, meet me in the office. Both of you.\"\nAustin and Valerie shared a glance—both of them knew that it must be about what happened yesterday in the royal court. Not only that, the fact Austin lied and went to Drenovar must have offended the old man.\nHowever, since they already expected it Austin didn’t delay responding, \"Understood. We will be there.\"\nGiving them a nod, the older one soon left the venue.\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed reading the chapter. There are several things Austin doesn’t know about Valerie, but slowly he will.",

      "content": "After finishing dinner, Valerie and Austin wasted no time and promptly made their way to the Headmaster’s office, ensuring he didn’t have to wait long.\nValerie noticed that her Lord had been silent for a while now, ever since Elion interrupted them.\n\"Austin...are you upset because of what Elion said?\" Finally, but in a hesitant voice, she asked.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"I am upset but with myself.\" His eyes traveled far ahead, not affixed to a single point, as he said, \"It’s so embarrassing for me to say that I love you, yet I know nothing about you. Unlike you, who pursued the one in whom you had interest, I got you very easily.\"\nWith a self-mocking smile, the blond one added, \"That’s why maybe I became so nonchalant about you. Felt like whatever happens, she won’t leave me.\"\nValerie grew worried, as she said, \"You don’t need to think like that. And I never considered you taking this relationship casually.\" She meant what she said.\nAlthough they had a very long, patchy path, especially after Aiden arrived in Austin’s life, they somehow got together.\nThe cause was unexpected but Valerie was happy with how things were. Her love for her Lord has only elevated with time, and having her feelings reciprocated just made her life perfect.\nAustin held her hand, an exhale leaking through his lips, as he muttered, \"Val...I won’t say negative things anymore, but can you listen to this request of mine?\"\nValerie slowly came to a pause, matching him. Her eyes were drawn at him, never breaking the eye contact as she nodded, \"Yes...\"\nAustin held both of her hands and squeezed them as he said, \"You deserve all the happiness, Valerie. Don’t assume that I am doing you a favor by being with you. If you feel that I am doing something wrong or I am unaware of things related to you, then show displeasure. That’s the charm of a relationship.\"\nBringing his hand to cup her cheek he added, \"And lastly, please let me know more about you...talk to me more...tell me stories of your past. I swear nothing could keep me engaged more than those stories, which include Valerie. So let me hear more from you.\"\nDuring those days, when all she could do was admire him from the sidelines, never even once she thought that Austin would be so interested in her.\nHe was pleading to know more about her. And she could tell it was not because of what Elion said; rather, he was genuinely curious. He needed to know more about her.\nLeaning her face in his touch, she affirmed, \"Mm...I will tell you.\"\n°°°°°°°\n*Knock*\nPhilius heard the knock before he lifted his eyes from the letter and told the guest, \"Come in.\"\nFrom the other side, two familiar faces stepped inside before Austin closed the door behind his back.\nStepping towards the table, they stood in silence—allowing Philius to begin\n\"First, congratulations on being selected as Elites for the tournament. And thank you for the favor you two have extended toward Eryndor.\"\nAustin responded in his natural tone, \"It was my obligation as the Prince to protect my nation. But still, thank you for acknowledging us and our efforts.\"\nPhilius gave a brief nod before ushering them to sit down.\nAustin pulled a chair for Valerie, receiving a sweet thanks from her before he sat down beside her.\nBoth teenagers were expecting something related to Aiden to be the next topic. However,\n\"I recently received a request. Someone demanded your presence.\"\nSaying so, the older one extended a letter in their direction.\nAustin exchanged a glance with Valerie while he extended his hand and took the letter.\nValerie leaned closer to him and they both read the letter.\n[The recent events in Drenovar, along with the movements of Valerie Corwon and Austin von Eryndor, have raised several concerns. As a result, the Council has formally summoned both individuals for questioning at the Council Headquarters.]\n—Chief Advisor, Selner.]\nAustin had a severe frown on his face.\nHe knows that name. The person whom no one from the Board could defy.\nA person with authority and immense strength.\nThe wielder of one of the Seven Tools of Destruction.\nWhen Rhea was having trouble defeating a Demon General even with the help of so many comrades and two Shards...Selner went against a General all on her own\nOne of the most influential people in the world and someone who shouldn’t have shown a sudden interest in anyone, including the protagonist.\nThen why did she suddenly summon them for questioning? Isn’t the case with Drenovar too trivial for her to bother about?\n\"Chief Advisor...I think I have read about her somewhere.\" Unlike Austin, whose knowledge comes from the game, Valerie wasn’t very informed about Selner.\nPhilius told her, \"She is respected by the board members of the Council. Not only does she have authority, but she is one of the S-rank warriors as well, who is known for her witchcraft. Ignoring her call, just because she isn’t one the Heads of the Council, would be foolish.\"\nPhilius was aware of what happened yesterday in the royal court. However, for him, this was more important than a criminal’s death.\nAustin remained silent for another moment, before he asked, \"You...can’t help in this, I guess?\"\nPhilius heaved a sigh, \"I am completely helpless here. You need to respond to her demand.\"\nAustin nodded and then contemplated for a moment.\nRaising his eyes, he asked, \"What are the chances for her to be summoning us so she could recruit Valerie?\"\nPhilius shook his head, \"I don’t think so since Madame Selner isn’t like those from the Board. She doesn’t care who serves the Council.\"\nContinue reading at .Côm\nValerie raised her brows, \"Then why did she even call us when all the information was openly revealed to them?\"\nWhen the demonic army attacked, the members of the Union Council were present there. And naturally, Drenovar’s soldiers mustn’t have hidden anything from them either.\nThen what exactly do they want?\n\"I am not sure what this is about; however, after a week, you two need to visit her in her office.\"\nValerie questioned, \"We will be in the middle of the tournament, though.\"\nPhilius assured them, \"The venue of the tournament is close to the Headquarters so you two will get the time.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Since it’s all decided, there is nothing we can do other than follow orders.\"\nSince he assumed that the talk was over, Austin said, \"Then, excuse us, Sir.\"\n\"Austin,\" Philius called out, making Austin stop just as he intended to get up before he heard the man saying, \"This tournament...it might be a little harsh for you since this is the first time you are participating in any of these events. However, I request you to put your team and this school above your pride.\"\nAustin smirked, \"There are limits, sir. And believe me, as a second prince who has been overlooked his entire life, my boundaries are far lower than you might expect. So rest assured.\"\nSoon, they left the office and headed back to their rooms.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. And don’t worry about the last statement. I won’t make him a doormat or something.",

      "content": "Later that night, as promised, Valerie arrived in his room.\nShe was slightly hesitant, considering her Lord was tired, and they had parted ways just half an hour ago, so she was not sure if she should visit him or not.\nThat’s why she decided to check on him, and if he was sleeping, she would have left.\nHowever, the moment she jumped from the tree to land on his window,\n\"Hello, beautiful.\" With his elbow resting on the window frame, and his face pressed on his curled fist, Austin greeted her.\nValerie was startled to see him here, nearly missing the mark and slipping—only for her Lord to catch her arm and hold her from falling.\n\"Did I scare you? Sorry~\" Austin smilingly pulled his beloved into the room. Well, waiting for her like that might not have been the best idea.\nExplore stories at .Côm\nValerie thanked him as she landed in his room and exhaled a long breath, \"I thought you might have fallen asleep.\"\nAustin teasingly smiled, \"Can’t be helped, my blanket isn’t warm enough.\"\nThe implication of those words made Valerie’s face warm as she averted her gaze slightly and asked, \"W-Well, maybe I can help.\"\n\"Sure you can...but if you are okay then let’s talk for a bit.\"\nValerie blinked in perplexity, but she instantly nodded.\nAustin went to the small kitchen he had and brought two cups of hot steaming coffee for both of them.\nInviting the girl to sit on the bed, he took a chair and handed the cup to her.\n\"Thank you.\" She thanked him before inhaling the aromatic scent of freshly crushed beans. Ah, he really knows what she likes.\nAustin nodded as he sat down across from her, and began the conversation, \"Val...can you tell me more about this tournament? Like how does it happen, and how many matches do we need to play?\"\nHe had knowledge of the game; however, very vaguely everything was explained since the game only focused on the Protagonist and her matches. A few glimpses of her harem member’s matches as well, but that didn’t give enough evidence of what this was all about.\nAnd since the original owner of the body never assumed himself participating in the tournament, he didn’t pay attention to it.\nIt wasn’t that he lacked the strength or confidence to be selected, but the real Austin knew becoming an Elite was out of his reach. And if he couldn’t participate alongside Rhea as an Elite, the original Austin saw no reason to care about the tournament at all.\nValerie hummed, before she asked, \"Can I get a paper and pen?\"\nAustin nodded, \"Yeah, sure.\"\nValerie got up from the bed and reached the table.\nAustin offered her a chair and the things she asked for.\nBoth of them sat while facing each other as Valerie first finished the coffee—she couldn’t let the beverage get cold, which was prepared by her Lord—and then she started writing.\n\"So the tournament is divided between two divisions: Rookie and Elites. Eight students will be participating from each division, so counting all the students, it would be one hundred twenty-eight from eight academies?\"\n\"Hmm? Eight? Aren’t there like seven major nation’s academies?\"\nValerie nodded, \"Yes, but every year, the council allows one academy from an underdeveloped town or city to participate in the tournament. They want to encourage them to improve and eventually earn a rightful place in the competition.\"\n\"Kind of like underdogs, huh? Well, continue.\"\nValerie nodded as she began writing in two columns, \"We don’t get to hear what matches we would be playing until we reach there, so no academy could get to practice beforehand. However, the Council never changes their pattern of matches.\"\nSaying so, Valerie wrote ’Stage One’.\n\"Forget about the Rookie division since their challenges would be completely different and more fun-related. The Elite division would be distributed into two squads from each academy, and they would be facing the squads from different academies. There will be a team-based round in the beginning, which would eliminate half of the Elite division by the ninth day.\"\nAustin’s brows elevated as he registered every word she spoke, before asking, \"You mean failing here means one won’t be allowed to continue?\"\nValerie nodded, \"Yes, and, the next round can only be played by the squad that won—replacing members and bringing someone from the defeated squad is prohibited.\"\nAustin’s brows drew closer as he asked, \"So if you are placed in a group of idiots which becomes a reason for you to lose....Valorian Academy would lose their best students in the initial phase, huh?\"\nValerie smiled, \"I might be strong but I am not the best, Austin.\"\nThat elicited a hum of questioning, as he asked, \"What do you mean?\"\n\"Experience does matter here. You cannot win the tournament with brute force. That’s why the President, who participated as a Rookie two years ago, is the best pick for this tournament.\"\nAustin scoffed; he didn’t believe that. For him Valerie was the best and someone who would bring Valorian Academy to glory.\nValerie smiled helplessly, seeing the reluctance from her Lord, before she continued, \"So by the ninth day, we would be left with sixty-four participants. At this stage, we would be grouped as a duo—making sixteen teams.\"\nShe spoke as she wrote, \"Thirty-two teams and one round would be held between four duos, and only a single pair would come out victorious. That’s why, by the fifth day we would be left with sixteen remaining people.\"\n\"Hmm...but there is a chance that more students from one academy would remain for the second round, and some academies might no longer be participating.\"\nValerie nodded, \"Indeed, that’s why there is a chance we fight against the people with whom we participated with.\"\nAustin smiled as he held her hand and said, \"Well, we will be together so I ain’t worried.\"\nValerie smiled fondly, \"Me too. But we need to make sure that we get into the same squad as well.\"\nAustin nodded—these team matches would be difficult considering his reputation in the academy.\n’That’s why the headmaster said that I might face severe difficulty...’ He was feeling a headache approaching\nValerie continued, \"Then comes the individual rounds where one has to play four rounds against the others to reach the finals.\"\nShe drew the whole chart of how the rounds would flow and how one could tread through all the challenges to stand at the top.\nAustin looked at the semi-finalist brackets as he asked, \"So, there is a chance we can face each other in the final round.\"\nValerie slowly moved her head left and right, \"Possibly.\"\nAustin looked up, a crisp smile on his face as he said, \"And if that happens, I won’t be holding back so make sure you don’t let your feelings become a reason for your defeat.\"\nValerie also looked back with her left eyebrow elevated as she said, \"I want to impress my fiancé so surely I will win.\"\n\"That so~well, let’s see.\"\nThe challenge was on.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- We are diving into this unexpected and full of twist arcs.

      "content": "Early in the morning, everyone gathered at the main gate of the academy.\nThey were told to wear their field uniform since the journey was a little long and they would need to camp outside as well.\nIf they travel at a moderate pace, then they will reach the venue by tomorrow morning.\nAnd that was perfect since tomorrow evening would be the opening ceremony of the tournament.\nThose who aren’t participating in the tournament can only come the day after tomorrow to watch the matches. Their transportation would be arranged by the academy as well.\nThe sixteen students, along with the backup team have gathered at the main entrance.\nValerie was looking in the distance silently, wondering if she should have visited Austin’s room since he hadn’t arrived until now.\n’Because of me ...he slept late.’ Even when she tried to feel guilty, she couldn’t.\nLast night...they flirted until late and then cuddled a whole lot. However, since Valerie had to prepare for the trip she didn’t stay there and returned.\nAnd it seems like, because of her, he got late in waking up.\n\"You seem quite worried.\"\nValerie turned to look at the person.\n\"Good morning, President.\" She greeted her—the student council President, Rothaux Anabelle.\nThe redhead President had braided her hair in a high ponytail and the uniform was clinging to her body in a way which made the boy glance at her more than it seemed appropriate.\nValerie...felt slightly better that Austin didn’t see her like this...but for how long?\n\"Your lover is late. Shouldn’t have kept him awake~\" Anna teasingly said, which made Valerie flinch. But then she realized that she was just teasing her, so she responded casually,\n\"He must have been training until late.\"\nAnna raised her brows, \"He does give the impression of a diligent child.\"\nValerie smiled slightly and soon they both turned silent, standing side by side.\nAnna had her hands crossed behind her back, and her eyes rested on nothing constant, as she asked, \"Hey, Valerie....although I watched Austin’s match, I want to know, do you trust his strength enough to be a part of this tournament?\"\nValerie’s eyes turned cold, as she asked, \"What do you mean by that?\"\nNormally, that gaze and that tone would have easily made anyone flustered, however, Anna retained her composure and asked her, \"You know I would be given the role to lead the squad matches...to decide the teams based on what the Elites could do. And Austin is the only person with whom I have never participated in any activity before so I am uncertain about him.\"\nValerie didn’t lose her cool. Although she didn’t like it when someone talked like that about her beloved, she knew losing her cool here would be foolish on her end. What Anna was saying was true. She didn’t mean to degrade Austin—she was really curious and worried about the upcoming tournament.\nValerie confidently said, \"He may lack experience in group missions and he might be an unexpected addition for you...but I can say for certain that Austin won’t drag anyone down during the tournament. You can give him any role and he would excel.\"\nAnna kept looking at Valerie for a few moments.\nWas it her feelings that were clouding her judgment, or did she really feel so?\nAlthough Bella has seen Austin’s two matches, one when he fought the speedster and one when he fought against the teleportation girl.\nThere was no doubt that the guy has a high battle IQ, but can he fit in the team?\n’Why am I even questioning this when I have no other choice...Austin has already proven himself to be in this group, so I just need to trust his strength and place him in a spot where he can shine.’\nSeeing the blond guy advancing, Anna stepped away, rejoining her previous group.\n....\nAustin hurried toward the main entrance as he found his beloved standing there with a complicated look on her face\nHer brows were slightly drawn closer and her lips were pursed.\nShe didn’t even notice him until Austin reached near her and waved his hand before her eyes, \"Hey, are you okay?\"\nValerie was startled, as she hurriedly said, \"Y-You...are here. Good morning.\"\nShe regained her composure and greeted him.\nAustin raised his brows as he glanced at the President, who had been chatting with Valerie until he arrived.\nIn a whisper, he asked, \"Did she say something? The President?\"\nValerie bit her lips...unsure if she should tell her Lord about it or not. In the end, she decided to not hide it from him,\n\"She was...concerned about your place in the team. She said that you have never been a part of any of the groups she worked with. That’s why she is unsure about your spot.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh as he rested his hands on his silly fiancée’s shoulder before telling her, \"And you are concerned about that? Didn’t I say that I would be facing these kinds of questions a lot? And you cannot blame the President since until a few weeks ago, I couldn’t even hunt a D-rank beast on my own.\"\n\"But you have become stronger...you have earned your place in this tournament.\"\nAustin nodded, \"I know and she knows as well. However, these slight clouds of doubt will remain until I don’t perform well in the tournament. So stop worrying about it.\" Saying so, he brought the girl closer to him, hugging her shoulder and pressing her face against his chest.\nValerie also readily accepted the hug since she needed it. Her restless heart was searching for this warmth.\nSoon the vice-headmaster and the chief instructor arrived by the main entrance and told the students,\n\"The carriage has been prepared. Follow me.\" Turning around, he began walking out of the academy.\nEveryone followed him silently until they reached the carriages.\nThere were four of them, and all of them were ordinary but longer than an average carriage.\n\"Sit according to your preference but don’t step inside the last one,\" Harold spoke in his usual stern tone.\nBecause it was him, not the headmaster, no one dared to move noisily, and everyone sat inside the carriages one after another—choosing to sit with their friends and lovers.\nNaturally, Valerie and Austin also sat in the same carriage, followed by Rudolph and Rhea, who also found it more comfortable to sit with those with whom they were acquainted.\n\"Hey,\" Rhea greeted the duo as she sat across from them.\n*Dhak*\nThe carriage moved slightly as Rudolph sat down.\nHis massive frame and above-average size made the spacious carriage look small.\n\"Woke up late?\" Rudolph asked with his brows raised.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Was just taking my time to pack things up.\"\nRhea suddenly asked, \"You have packed formal clothes too?\" She looked worried? Stay tuned for updates on .Côm\nAustin blinked, \"No...why?\"\nRhea grew more worried, \"But there is a ceremony tomorrow, right? We will need to wear formal dresses, right?\"\nAustin sighed while Valerie rolled her eyes.\nIt was Rudolph who informed her, \"We have to wear our academy’s uniform during the ceremony because that shows from where we come, and whom we represent.\"\nRhea had an embarrassed expression, \"I should have guessed...gah.\" Her shoulders slumped as she regretted packing so many things in her bag...to the point, that there was no room left to even adjust a med kit inside.\nShe really needs to learn from Valerie. So prepared and composed all the time.\n*Click*\nThe doors of the carriage opened, only to reveal two people—a girl and a boy.\n\"Ooh~\" Rudolph had a smirk on his face as he identified the two people.\nThe two people who got defeated by Austin and Valerie in the trials.\nElara and Ryan.\n\"Oh, I am leaving.\" Elara instantly turned around, ready to sit in any carriage—even the roof of it would work—but this one.\nHowever, the moment she turned around, she found the vice-headmaster standing there, making the girl flinch before she heard him say,\n\"All the other carriages are full, so go sit inside.\"\n\"Y-Yes.\" In front of Harold, no one dared to talk. And the same goes for Elara.\nShe instantly climbed the carriage and sat beside Austin. Beside Rudolph, Ryan took a seat.\nRyan was slightly on the leaned side so there was no problem for him to comfortably sit beside Rudolph.\nOn the other side, Austin and Valerie were both lean and were sitting quite close, that’s why there was enough space for two people to sit.\nAs such, Elara chose to sit as far as she could from the last man she wanted to share the seat with.\nNeither Ryan said a word nor Elara turned to look at them.\nSeeing the tension in the air, Rhea couldn’t help but mutter, ’This is going to be one awkward journey...’\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you all liked the chapter.

      "content": "Inside the carriage, silence persisted for too long. After all, one of the six lost to Valerie in the trials, and one lost to Austin.\nWell, in Valerie’s case, it was expected. However, the humiliation Elara had to face after her defeat against a D-rank warrior was immense.\nAlthough she got selected as an Elite thanks to her other matches, she hasn’t forgotten what she faced back in the arena.\n’Agh...just thinking about it makes my stomach hurt...’ She massaged the spot which was beaten black and blue during their match.\nShe has yet to understand how someone tracked her teleportation. She was in self-doubt for a very long, thinking that maybe there was some kind of loop that might give away her presence, rendering her skill useless.\nIt was the biggest horror of her life, that threatened her until she faced her next match—and seamlessly overwhelmed her opponent. Not only that, she even went against an A-rank later and even won that.\nCrazy!\nThat helped her realize that it was only one guy in her whole life who had found a loophole in her Shard’s technique.\nAlthough she was eager to ask him what it was so her future opponents couldn’t exploit it, she was hesitant to talk to him.\n’Guh...look at those creeps.’ A tremor snaked through her spine, seeing Valerie and Austin being all lovely dovey. Get a room or something!\n\"By the way, Austin. Have you thought of re-evaluation?\" The only person Elara genuinely admires in the whole carriage is Junior Rudolph!\n\"I am not exactly sure if I should...you see, my Shard has yet to evolve.\"\nThe loser spoke....but, since Elara lost to him, isn’t she a bigger loser?\n’Agh...how did I lose to someone who is still at stage zero? I need to train!’\nWhile Elara was going through her inner conflict, Rudolph added, \"They don’t ask for your Shard’s stage; they give you a set of trials to determine your rank. Only below B-rank though.\"\nIf one wants to be ranked A or S then their Shard must have gone through evolutions.\n\"He is right, and as of now, I think you may have reached B-rank?\" Rhea added, and that made Austin smile,\n\"Nope, I haven’t reached B-rank yet—well, not completely. Although I have the speed, without strength and the support of my Shard, I might be just C-rank. So getting a promotion of a single rank doesn’t sound tempting to me.\"\nHearing the lack of motivation in his voice made Rhea feel sad and guilty somehow.\nEven Valerie had a sad expression, seeing her Lord lacking confidence.\nAustin generally doesn’t sound this dejected, however, after his loss against that Minotaur, he feels that he still has some progress to make to become a B-rank.\nAnd then there was the trauma of being nearly killed by the demon too—which had given him a nightmare last night, and Austin ended up waking up late today.\n’I can’t let this feeling drag me down during the competition...’ Deciding to get rid of this clog in his mind, he resolved to dwell in the dungeon today and defeat the mid-boss anyhow.\nSince there was a day for the tournament to begin, he would get enough time to rest. So, no problem with that.\n°°°°°°\nThe sky darkened, and the wind was strong, but in the forest, it was bearable.\nSince it would take another six hours to reach and they had enough time, Harold told the carriage drivers to stop.\nStudents slowly began to get out of their carriages, as Harold told them, \"Start building the camp. Twenty minutes.\"\nThe students were no longer moving leisurely and instantly began to take out the camp canvas nails and other equipment.\nValerie and Austin stepped out and the first thing Anna told them was, \"Go bring wood from the forest. A lot of them.\"\nAustin and Valerie glanced at each other before they nodded, \"Okay.\"\nSince they had to do something, why not bring wood?\nRudolph and Rhea were given separate tasks; the boy was told to help in holding the tent while the pinkhead was asked to help in preparing the ingredients for dinner.\nThe forest was too silent, to the point of being eerie.\nAustin was holding a small lantern that allowed them to see in the dense forest.\n*Krik* *Krik*\nThe sound of the nocturnal creatures echoed occasionally; however, other than that, there was no sighting of any wild beasts.\nValerie slowly brought her hand to hold the hem of his shirt, before she asked, \"Are you okay?\"\nHearing her voice, he realized that he indeed made her worried by how he reacted back in the carriage.\nRead exclusive chapters at .Côm\n\"Well...it still haunts me sometimes...what I faced back in Drenovar.\" He didn’t hide it from her since she was the only person who wouldn’t use his failures against him under any circumstances.\nValerie bit her lip, feeling frustrated with herself that she wasn’t there when her Lord needed her and something disastrous happened.\nShe knew the situation he faced would leave lasting damage on his psyche. However, despite having the expectation, seeing him like this, made her feel extremely guilty and sad.\n\"Val...\" Suddenly, Austin pulled Valerie behind a tree, startling the girl.\nHe even pressed his hand against her lips, preventing her from making a sound.\nShe looked at him in surprise, before asking him with her brows elevating.\nAustin slowly removed his hand from her mouth before pointing in the direction they were heading to.\nValerie slowly turned to look over her shoulder, only to find a small pack of wolves.\nThere were two big ones and several small ones, making a shelter under a tree and having their family time.\nThe white wolf was licking the little one’s fur, while the patchy one was playing with the other two kids.\n\"Doesn’t it look comfortable...and admirable?\" Austin softly muttered as he saw the family.\nValerie hummed before she turned to look at him.\nThe look in his eyes made her feel fuzzy inside as she held his shirt and asked, \"Do you like children?\"\nAustin smilingly nodded.\"I do...and I want to make a big family where we won’t need to worry about any kind of danger. Just you and me, and our little ones.\" Austin leaned closer and softly tapped his forehead against hers.\nValerie closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of her Lord’s words seeping inside her.\nThe very thought of building a family with the one she loves made her extremely excited yet calmed her down at the same time.\nIn the end, the only words that came out were, \"I also do.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- You know a person who doesn’t do anything but relax your mind just being around you? Valerie is like that for him.\nDrop a comment.",

      "content": "Back in the camp, everyone had settled down, and the campfire was already lit…even though Valerie and Austin were given the duty of bringing the firewood.\nAnna shook her head as a sigh seeped through her lips, \"I knew you two would be late that’s why I told Elion to bring wood. Anyway, Valerie, can you help with the soup? They are having a hard time chopping vegetables.\"\nThe violette nodded before she glanced at her beloved, and with a smile, she said, \"Wait for me.\" Saying so, she made her way toward where other students were chopping vegetables, and meat and preparing other things for dinner.\nSeeing her taking the knife and expertly chopping the vegetables made Austin sigh,\n’Such a fine wife she would become…’\nSeeing that expression on his face, Anna giggled, \"I am happy to see that it isn’t just Valerie who is so head over heels for you…you are the same.\"\nAustin shrugged, \"I mean, it’s impossible not to fall for such a lovely girl.\"\nAnna smilingly nodded, \"Right, that’s why Valerie receives so many letters so regularly.\"\nAustin’s eyes turned frosty as he turned to look at the redhead before asking, \"What letters?\" Discover hidden content at .Côm\nAnna stuck her tongue out, \"You didn’t know? Ehh~did I overstep my boundaries?\" Saying so she clasped her hands and requested, \"Please don’t tell her that I told you…you see, sometimes my adorable junior becomes really scary.\"\nAustin huffed, \"Thanks for telling me, and don’t worry, I won’t bring your name in this.\" Austin had really no idea that despite being engaged some bastards were pestering his woman.\n\"By the way, Austin…I heard what happened in the royal court,\" Turning to look at him, she asked, \"Are you really fine after what happened?\"\nAustin wasn’t surprised about her reach to the royal court; after all, the Rothaux family was one of the biggest trader families that had connections with three different nations, including Hener.\nBeing the daughter of the company’s owner, it was not surprising that she knew about the incident that took place.\nAustin inhaled a long breath before telling her honestly, \"I don’t feel anything…no emotional burden and no physical changes. I am fit and healthy for the tournament.\"\nAnna’s hands crossed behind her back as she leaned sideways, and while looking at him with an upturned gaze, she said, \"I wasn’t asking you because of the tournament. But I am glad that you are okay.\"\nAustin was slightly surprised to hear that. The mysterious President, who always wears a smile on her face and is hard to read, was being considerate towards him, huh? He wasn’t used to it. Definitely not from a stranger.\nShe soon regrouped with her friends, leaving Austin alone\nSince there was nothing he had to do, Austin sat down before the campfire and watched the flames in a daze.\nHe would be diving into the second dungeon tonight and challenge the mid-boss again.\nWhy was he doing so? Well, the primary goal was to level up so he could give his best during the tournament and not drag his team down.\nThe second motive was to get rid of these mental restraints that have been weighing down on him for some time now. So yes, it was necessary.\nBut before going there, ’System, how can I use the Resonant Bond?’\n[Ding!]\n[The host needs to be in a certain range with the person whose Shard the host wants to temporarily borrow.]\n’So it would be like I would be taking their Shard for a few minutes?’\n[Indeed, host. And since the host is planning to use the borrowed Shard in the dungeon, the original owner wouldn’t know when their Soul Shard would get stolen.]\nAustin worryingly asked, ’Will that affect their soul?’\n[Not at all, host!]\nThat relieved him. Although he doesn’t care much about anyone except for Valerie here, damaging one’s soul for his selfish desires would be deranged on his part. If it had been some emergency, then that might have been understandable, but this was something he could do even without borrowing someone’s Shard.\n’Anyway, tell me, does the timer of the three minutes start right away after I borrow their Shard?’ He asked, since if that’s the case, then he might need to dive into the dungeon right away.\n[Indeed, host. After all, borrowing the part of one’s soul for long, would be dangerous.]\nAustin raised his brows, ’You said there is a way to upgrade the skill and elevate the usage time? Then...won’t that harm them?’\n[Ding!]\n[Excellent question, host!]\n[The system has taken the matter into consideration and would only allow the skill to be upgraded to the point where it doesn’t end up harming the original user of the Shard.]\n’Oh...damn, that’s clever.’\n[Clever host, clever system~~]\n\"...\" Austin has a feeling that the system has been talking a lot recently. But well, since it wasn’t pushing needlessly difficult tasks on him nor was adding any penalty, it was all fine.\n’Okay, let’s see whose Shard I can borrow...’ Everyone around him was the best of the best. They have defeated others to reach here, so their Shards must have an overpowered ability.\n’System...can you tell me whose Shard I can borrow?’\n[Indeed, host.]\nWhen the message disappeared from the field of his vision, Austin began seeing the people around him inside a box—most of them glowed red, showing that he could not borrow their Shard.\nAustin, despite knowing the answer, turned towards Valerie.\nThe girl also looked back at him, a smile lifting the edges of her lips, as she gestured that just a few minutes more.\nAustin nodded to her, as he found the box forming around her also turning red. Well, it would have been shocking if he could have borrowed her Shard.\nHe turned his eyes around and settled on a certain short-haired girl...Elara.\n’Hmm...she is the only compatible girl...and I know what her Shar can do.’\n’Teleportation or more like spatial substitution...hmm, I think that can be helpful.’ More like he didn’t have any other choice but to take her Shard.\nAgainst that monster, anything would be useful.\nWith those thoughts, Austin got up and began advancing toward Elara who was chopping the logs into four pieces using an axe.\n’How long do I need to be near her?’\n[For thirty seconds, host.]\nHearing that, Austin glanced at Valerie and found her pouring something into a bowl.\n’Wish me luck, love.’\nHe finally reached beside Elara and wordlessly took another axe.\n[Soul Resonating: 29...28...27...]\nElara frowned, seeing the blond guy beside her, before she asked, \"Wanna say something?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"I was free, so I thought I should help you.\"\nElara shrugged. Although she didn’t need help, telling him so and turning this into an argument felt like a waste of energy.\nSilence persisted between them for a few more seconds before Elara turned to look at him and said, \"Hey, can you tell me—\" And she stopped right there, as Austin already dove into the dungeon, once he finished borrowing her Shard.\n’Haah...let’s see...’ Finding himself back in the burning world, Austin heaved a sigh as he held two different Shards.\nOne was his own, and on the other hand, was a small shuriken that he had taken from Elara.\n’I hope this helps me with the monster.’\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I will keep the battle short, don’t worry.\nOn a side note, do you want me to write R-18 for this story? Well, it won’t affect the story and won’t contain any strong material so it can be skipped by those who aren’t comfortable with it. Drop your thoughts in the comment box.",

      "content": "Austin was back. Inside the dungeon, facing the twenty-foot-tall monstrosity.\nStanding amidst the corpses of fallen giants, he locked eyes with the Minotaur.\nAs the system said, before reaching any boss, he had to defeat all the mobs once again. And the sad part is they gave barely any points.\n[Total points: 352]\nBut well, Austin’s goal was to defeat the creature before his eyes who had given him the taste of defeat for the first time after reincarnating.\nHe didn’t ask for a resting zone and decided to fight right away.\nReason? Elara’s Shard was about to fade away, and Austin wanted to use the remaining time in his favor.\n\"*HUFF*\" The big nose of the beast exhaled visible air as it held its weapon with both hands and slammed its hoof on the ground with enough force to send tremors.\nAustin took a deep breath, steadying himself. Then, with a sharp motion, he crossed his hands over each other before snapping them apart—flinging the shuriken and Wisp in opposite directions like a sudden burst of lightning splitting the sky.\nThe beast’s eyes gleamed, locking onto Austin. But in the blink of an eye—SHFF—he swapped places with the shuriken, dodging the paralyzing glare by a hair’s breadth.\n\"HUFF…\" The minotaur exhaled sharply, caught off guard. Its bloodlust, meant to paralyze its prey, was wasted.\nIt twisted its massive frame, scanning the area—only to hear a sharp whistle cutting through the air.\nAustin was already mid-air, his hair fluttering as he hurled the shuriken toward its skull.\nCRACKLE!\nLightning surged as he summoned Raijin. The sudden burst of electricity sent a violent warning through the beast’s nerves. It spun toward the sound—toward the blond standing above.\nTHUNK THUNK\nIt charged. Each step cracked the earth, sending vibrations rippling outward. The weight of the beast was abyssal, its sheer presence suffocating.\nBut then—\nFWIP!\nAustin was gone.\nCRACK!\n\"AGHRERR!\"\nThe minotaur’s roar shattered the air as something struck from above. Sparks crawled over its thick skull, burrowing into its flesh. Its muscles twitched uncontrollably.\nHowever, the monster was far from being defeated.\nIt swung its massive weapon upward, only for—\n*Click*\n—Austin to switch places with the Shard once again.\n*Tap*\nAustin’s feet touched the ground, right before the monster.\nUsing instant teleportation had its advantages.\nNo wonder Elara was one of the strongest in Valorian Academy.\n’I guess I need to hurt him a little more—’\nHis thoughts cut off.\n\"KHRUUUUUUEENGH!\"\nThe monster’s howl shook the air, its massive frame pulsing with power. A sinister glow spread across its body as if something inside had awakened.\nAustin instinctively took a step back, his breath hitching. The pressure pressing down on him was overwhelming—disastrous. His muscles tensed, and for the first time, doubt flickered in his mind.\nThe minotaur spun its weapon above its head, the sheer force stirring the wind into a violent howl—before it brought it down in a diagonal slash.\nCRACK!\nThe ground didn’t just split—it was ripped apart. A massive air slash tore through space, rushing toward Austin.\nAnd this time, he had no way to escape.\nSLAASH!\n\"AGHHHH!!\"\nThe wind screamed past him, his clothes shredding apart. Blood sprayed into the air as deep, burning cuts riddled his body. The force sent him hurtling back, his vision spinning as pain lanced through every nerve.\nHis grip loosened. His shuriken—his lifeline—faded.\nNo escape.\nDHAK!\nHis back slammed into the dungeon’s barrier, the impact rattling through his bones. A ragged breath tore from his throat before his body finally collapsed to the ground.\nHis chest rose and fell unevenly. Each inhale burned.\nHis whole body—a mess. Hundreds of cuts marred his skin, blood trickling down in countless streams.\nHe remained lying there lifelessly, giving the Minotaur the opportunity to close in.\nThe monster slowly approached the dead meat, its weapon lazily pressed on its shoulder as it stepped closer and closer to the human.\n\"*HUFF*\" A huff of pride and arrogance as the monster appeared before Austin and raised its foot to end the farce once and for all, when suddenly,\n*TING*\nA heavy burden slammed down on the Minotaur’s massive frame.\nIts foot, raised to crush the human beneath it, suddenly faltered mid-air—trembling.\nIts breath hitched.\nThen—\n\"KHRRRHHH!!\"\nA guttural snarl escaped its throat as an invisible force coiled around its body, slithering into its very core. Its muscles stiffened, its instincts screaming in alarm.\nIt felt like being submerged in a sea of pure malice.\nAustin rose.\nThe deep gashes across his body stitched themselves shut, flesh mending as though his injuries had never existed.\n[Ding!]\n[Skill Adapt is in use!]\n[Skill Adaptive Flesh is in use!]\nHe exhaled sharply, dragging the back of his hand across his bloodied lips. Then, his gaze lifted—cold and unyielding—as he fixed his eyes on the frozen Minotaur.\nIt stood there, its massive leg hovering mid-stomp, its entire body twitching. The once-proud behemoth—paralyzed by its own medicine.\nAustin’s lips curled into a vicious smirk.\n\"Bitter, isn’t it?\" His voice was low, mocking. \"The very medicine you force-feed others.\"\nThe beast’s muscles spasmed violently, its instincts roaring for it to move. But its body refused.\nCRACK!\nAustin launched himself forward, wind tearing past his ears as he soared toward the Minotaur’s towering frame.\nThe beast’s eyes widened in alarm—\nTHUD!\nAustin landed on its shoulder, boots pressing into the thick, muscled flesh.\n\"KHRUHHH…\" A deep, panicked groan rumbled from the beast’s throat.\nBut before it could react—\nAustin plunged his hand straight into the Minotaur’s massive nose.\nThe beast convulsed, its head jerking back as it gargled in shock.\nAustin’s arm pushed in deeper—farther than it should have. His fingers curled, his knuckles cracking as he clenched his fist.\nThe Minotaur’s body jerked, its legs stumbling. It staggered backward—\nBut it was already too late.\nAustin’s grin sharpened.\n\"See you in hell, buddy~\"\nBOOM!\nSomething erupted from Austin’s fist.\nA shining blue weapon—his Shard—tore through the Minotaur’s insides like a merciless spear, ripping straight through flesh and bone, traveling downward at a terrifying speed.\nIt burst through its pelvis, tearing the monster apart from the inside, before stabbing deep into the dungeon floor with a deafening THUD!\nThe Minotaur’s howl of agony never even left its throat.\nIts eyes remained wide, frozen, as thick rivulets of blood poured from its gaping mouth, from its nose, from its very eyes.\nAustin twisted his arm, his grip tightening—\nAnd then—\nSCHLURK!\nThe Shard expanded, its jagged edges splitting open, shredding every last organ inside the beast’s body—turning everything into an unrecognizable pulp.\nA deep shudder passed through the Minotaur’s massive frame—before, finally, its strength gave out.\nIt collapsed to its knees.\nThen—\nWith one final, sickening lurch—\nIt fell.\nStay updated with .Côm\nAustin heaved a sigh, as he jumped away from the Minotaur, his Shard returning to its original size of a dagger.\nHe knew that damaging the skin of the beast was fruitless, so he had to somehow find an opening that led him inside its body.\nSo there were two options—nose and...well, Austin chose the first one.\nLooking at his arm and his body which was full of blood and mucus, he sighed, \"Lucky that I don’t have to appear like this in front of Val...\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- If you are wondering when Austin copied Blood Lust from the monster, then when the beast sent the wind attack, it paralyzed Austin.\nThanks for reading.",

Just tired.\" He has been spacing out ever since. Not because he wasn’t paying attention to the conversation or the food his beloved made. Rather, it was the fatigue from the dungeon that was weighing down on him.\n\"Man...a few hours of the journey it all took to take you down~\"\nValerie glared at Elion, however, the guy remained nonchalant as he continued to munch on the sandwich.\nAnnabelle pinched Elion’s cheek, making the guy groan, before she said, \"How about you rest in the tent for the time being? There are still two hours left before we resume the journey,\"\nAustin glanced at Valerie and, looking at her worried visage, ushered him to nod, \"Yeah, that would be the best.\" Since he had already finished the food, he rested the bowl on the table before getting up.\nValerie was fidgeting at her place, unsure if she should follow him when Rhea spoke, \"There are insects in the tent. Here; use this to repel them.\" She handed her a spray.\nValerie couldn’t suppress the smile, as she took the spray and got up, \"Thank you.\"\nRhea was taken aback by that smile...although she had seen her smile before, it was the first time for Valerie to talk so gently to her.\n\"What? Are you falling for her or something?\" Elion teased—only to get his other cheek pulled.\n...\nValerie reached the tent slowly and carefully lifted the cover to peek inside.\nHer heart warmed up at the sight awaiting her.\nInside the tent, there was only a single person.\nAustin was lying down on the makeshift bed with his arm being used as a pillow.\n’He looks so peaceful...’ She slowly stepped inside, not wanting to disturb him—but,\n\"Ah, Val...did you need something?\" He groggily opened his eyes and asked her.\nValerie felt guilty for waking him, but since he had already woken up,\n\"Ah...what ....are...\" Austin was surprised as he found his head being pressed on something far softer and more comfortable than his arm.\nA lap pillow.\nValerie tucked his hair strands behind his ear, as she said, \"Sweet dreams.\"\nAustin sheepishly asked, \"Will that be fine? Is my head not heavy?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"Not at all. And since it’s about a few hours, I will be fine.\" Truth be told, she wouldn’t have minded being like this for days, but a few hours would do.\n\"If you say...then...thank you.\" Austin must be really tired since once he closed his eyes, he fell asleep in a few seconds.\nThe slight sound of his even breathing and his peaceful sleeping face was the best medicine to calm down her heart.\nHer mind turned serene seeing him sleep. She slowly ran her fingers through his hair…knowing that he liked it.\nRemembering the time when he told her that, her eyes went toward his chin. On the left side, there was still a faint cut that remained.\n’You took that hit for me without hesitation…’ It was one of those days when Austin pulled Valerie away from a boring gathering and brought her to the market.\nHe had several hats in his room, so he used to lend her one whenever they went out for their little excursion.\nValerie also didn’t like the gathering of the noble kids, since they always badmouthed her and said rude things about her eyes and the way she talked.\nThe fact was despite being only six by that time, she already started to feel angry whenever someone said rude things about her in front of Austin.\nShe had felt this way about him for a long time. As a child, his presence was the light that kept her from becoming cold and detached.\nHe didn’t do anything out of pity, but just he felt that she was an interesting person since Valerie didn’t flatter him needlessly and according to Austin she was a fun person to talk to—even though between them, mostly Austin spoke and Valerie listened to him.\n’Just like that day…’ When Austin brought Valerie out of the palace, he was talking to her all the time while holding her hand and leading her through the busy streets.\nShe would simply watch his back and listen intently to his words. Later, once home, it became a habit to recall their conversations and write them in her diary, cherishing them for the future.\nThat day, Austin went to buy some sweet buns for her, when Valerie’s eyes caught a hat hanging by the shop.\nSince she knew that he liked hats, she didn’t think twice before taking the hat and bringing it to him.\nHowever, the shopkeeper considered her as a thief and was about to hit her, when Austin came in the way and took the hit from the man.\nAnd not only that, he hit him back with whatever force he could muster.\nIt was truly a horrifying sight for her…Valerie only wanted to gift the hat to him, and that caused Austin so much pain.\nAlthough later the shopkeeper was arrested and was never seen again, she regretted her action excessively that day.\nIf there was something she vividly remembers about that day other than the incident then it was the lap pillow she gave him in the infirmary.\nAnd the fact…that, after a long time, Valerie cried to her heart’s content that day.\nThat was the day when he told her that he liked to lay on her lap.\nIt was then and it was now.\nSo many things have changed. They have gone through so many phases and faced so many troubles.\nHowever, if there was something that never changed from that day, then it was—\n\"I love you, Austin.\"\n--her love for her savior.\n------^^------\nA/N:- To be honest, I had another scene for this chapter, but it felt so perfect, so I left it there.

      "content": "Nearly an hour past dawn, the carriages from the Valorian academy reached the venue.\nIt was not far away from the headquarters of the Council.\nThe towering domes rose into the sky, their golden tops gleaming under the sun. Each was built with smooth white stone, standing proud like ancient guardians of the land. Banners of deep crimson and royal blue fluttered from high poles, catching the wind as if they carried the voices of past champions.\nThe carriages were halted before the main entrance before Harold stepped out and told others to get out.\nSlowly every student began to climb down the carriages and lined up before the main entrance.\nAustin stood behind Valerie as he assessed the surroundings.\nThe scent of the sea was profound in the area.\nThe land where the tournament venue was built, stretched endlessly. There was nothing as far as the eye could see.\n’Ancient war was fought here ...’ This was one of the spots where the Hero and Demon King clashed and because of the miasma the Dark Lord released, until now, the soil has yet to regain its fertility.\n\"Nervous butterflies are making me restless.\" Hearing that voice, Austin glanced back and found the pink head standing there.\n\"Are you not nervous?\" She asked him, only for Austin to shake his head,\n\"Just need to focus on my matches.\" He replied.\nRudolph chuckled, \"You won’t be saying that once you see the crowd. It’s on a whole different level compared to the trials.\"\nAustin shrugged—he had performed before a massive crowd before, both during when he had a fever for rugby and the craze of MMA.\n\"They are checking everyone’s ID.\" Valerie’s serious voice reached his ears before Austin turned to look at the entrance.\nThey have been checking everyone’s belongings and their student’s id. Discover stories with .Côm\nAustin remembered the teacher telling them that to participate as an Elite you have to be B-rank. Although it wasn’t a prerequisite for the trials, the tournament was a different case.\n’I hope the headmaster has arranged something...’ Slowly, the queue decreased, and it was Valerie’s turn to show her ID card.\n\"Hmm...?\" The security officer was startled to see the golden ’S’ on the card before he lifted his eyes and looked at the girl.\n\"You may pass.\" He said after her belongings were assessed and handed back to her.\nValerie nodded and stepped inside the venue, but didn’t proceed inside as directed, \"I am waiting for someone,\" she told the staff member.\nThe staff member told her, \"Don’t make it long; you will block others’ paths.\"\nValerie gave a nod before she turned toward the entrance.\nAustin handed his ID card to the man, as he took a deep breath.\nThe security in-charge frowned, seeing the D-rank on the card before he looked up, \"Austin Eryndor...what does this mean? Are you joking here?\"\nHis harsh tone somehow made the surroundings frosty, as the man looked around.\nAustin wordlessly requested Valerie to calm down as he saw Harold hurriedly advancing toward them.\n\"Here, this may save you time.\" He handed an envelope on which the seal of the Valorian academy was visible.\nThe security guard checked the letter, written by the headmaster. His brows remained creased as he finished reading before looking at Austin.\nHanding the letter back and ID card to Austin, he said, \"You may pass.\" The mood of the security guard didn’t seem pleasant. Someone serving the Council didn’t like favoritism, even though the person in question was the Prince of Eryndor.\nHowever, since the Headmaster has given his consent and shown his confidence, the security guard could do nothing.\nAustin heaved a sigh before he took his bag and advanced inside.\nHolding the hand of his lover, which was excessively cold, he said, \"I told you it won’t be easy.\"\n\"And I told you that I won’t be able to control myself when someone badmouth you.\" She instantly responded, still feeling the itch to freeze the man until his blood turned frozen.\nAustin chuckled, \"Forget about that. I got the permission, and that’s what matters.\"\nValerie hummed, still a bit displeased.\nAt the end of the gallery, the path split into several hallways, each leading to different wings of the dormitory.\nThere were staff members holding the boards of different academies.\nAustin and Valerie approached the one who had the board of Valorian Academy before they heard her saying, \"The left one is for boys. And the right, for girls. You will find the common hall as you further walk ahead.\"\nAustin nodded before he turned toward Valerie and said, \"Let’s meet in the common hall after half an hour?\"\n\"Fifteen minutes?\" She requested. Her upturned gaze melted the heart of the staff member and the one to whom it was directed.\nAustin sighed, a smile blooming on his face as he nodded, \"Okay, fifteen minutes.\" He gave a soft kiss on her forehead before waving at her.\nWalking through the hallway, he found there were rooms on either side, with the warning written—can only be occupied by two people.\nAustin didn’t think much and entered the first room he spotted.\n\"Oh...hello, Sheldon.\" He greeted the guy who was already present inside. The heir of Duke Runebound and the vice-president of the Student Council.\nHe was the prime suspect during the demon attack on the academy.\n\"Morning.\" The boy responded briefly without lifting his eyes from the book he was reading.\nAustin didn’t say anything after that and rested his bag on the bed, placed on the other side of the room.\nThere were two cupboards, one bathroom and one toilet, and a study table.\nHe looked around and found there was a food and drinks menu resting over the table, from which the students could order.\nWell, although he was hungry, he decided not to eat there.\nSitting down on the bed, he asked the system,\n’How many points do I have now?’ The bed was unexpectedly comfortable, as he felt himself getting engulfed in clouds.\nThe system ding-ed,\n[Total Points: 852]\nA smile bloomed on his face. This wasn’t the first time Austin checked the points...it was just too elating to see so many points.\nHe has yet to defeat the main boss and the mobs introduced before them. So surely, he would get enough points from them to unlock the next dungeon.\nAs such, ’System....unlock the shop for me.’\n[Ding!]\n[Are you sure you want to unlock ’Shop’ option by using 500 system points?]\n’Yes.’ He said as he got up and got ready.\n[Ding!]\n[Command accepted.]\n[Unlocking the Shop....]\n[Downloading the data....]\n[Integrating with system...]\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, host! You have locked Shop!]\nOnce the system screen faded, a logo of shoping cart appeared before his eyes.\nAustin didn’t think twice before choosing it mentally.\nOnce he did, four options came up,\n[Potions]\n[Weapon]\n[Utilities]\n[Artifact]\n....\nAustin narrowed his eyes before he chose, ’Weapon.’\nTen weapons popped up when he chose the option.\nHe read briefly about their rank and abilities.\nLike there was one:\n[Reaper: C-]\n[Price: 300 Points]\n[Ability: Wounds inflicted by this dagger will not clot naturally and will continue to bleed over time.]\n[Note: Skill cannot be upgraded.]\n[Note: Ability won’t work on higher level opponent or if someone has healing ability.]\nAustin hummed...quite useless dagger then. The opponent he would be facing would all be above B-rank, so there was no point in purchasing it.\nHis eyes went down the list and rested on the most expensive weapon,\n[Name: Scavenger]\n[Rank: A-]\n[Price: 2000 Points]\n[Ability: Absorbs opponent’s Soul Energy with each attack they direct.]\nThis was something good...however, the price was a little too much.\nHe had several other things to check, however, since it was already fifteen minutes, he decided to focus on his first priority.\nGetting up, he was about to leave, when suddenly,\n\"Austin...are you going to the common hall?\"\nAustin’s brows elevated as he nodded, \"Yeah.\"\nSheldon somehow seemed a bit embarrassed but then he asked, \"If you find the President there, tell her I won’t be coming.\"\nAustin hummed in surprise...were they close? Well, it is not surprising, considering they both were in the council.\n\"Got it. I will tell her.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "[Management Department]\nThe security guard who was in charge of examining every student’s identity and belongings was standing before the management team.\nHis hands crossed behind his back before he uttered, \"Austin Eryndor is a D-rank yet he was allowed by the Headmaster of Valorian Academy to participate in the tournament. As per the rule, this shouldn’t be allowed.\"\nThe four members of the department glanced at each other before one of them informed us, \"We received a word from Sir Philius about it. And the two members of the Monitoring Division confirmed Austin’s abilities. We had no choice but to allow him.\"\nThe head of security had a stern look on his face, rejection clear from his stance, but saying anything further would not be suitable for someone at his post.\nOne of the four members heaved a sigh as he said, \"Well if the other students get to know about his rank, surely a commotion would arise.\"\nAnother member added, \"Well, if he really is worthy then we don’t need to worry though. After the first round, everyone would know if Austin Eryndor really deserves to be here or not.\"\nThe security chief blinked in surprise before he asked, \"Isn’t the first-round squad matches? Won’t he pass the round with the help of his friends?\" The pattern never changes; that’s what the security chief voiced.\nThe management head relayed, \"You have done your job quite well, soldier. You may return to your post now.\"\nIn short, you shouldn’t ask any further.\nThe man gave a firm salute before making his way out of the room.\nWell, until the unworthy ones get eliminated.\n°°°°°°°\nAustin and Valerie were sitting together in the common hall as they were having some snacks for breakfast. Find exclusive stories on .Côm\nSeeing the lack of people in the common hall, Austin muttered, \"It seems the other academies haven’t arrived yet.\"\nTruth be told, Austin was slightly looking forward to the other academies’ arrival. After all, a main character would be making his appearance during the tournament.\nAnd not just anyone—the long-lost childhood friend of the protagonist.\n\"Or they might be resting in their rooms...having breakfast in their rooms since everyone must be tired....yet I called you here...\" Valerie’s answer started normally but near the end, Austin sensed guilt in her voice.\nAustin smiled at the following girl before telling her, \"Food tastes better if you are having it with someone you love. And with you, even plain water tastes fulfilling, Val.\"\nThe edges of her lips lifted slightly, but she soon shook her head and said, \"Still, after we finish, please go and rest. You looked quite tired last night, and considering there is a ceremony in the evening, you should utilize your time by resting.\"\nAustin raised his hand, \"Okay, got it. Now, let’s eat.\" He was tired but not that much. But since his wife was telling him to, he couldn’t resist.\n\"Ah, yeah, Val, if you see the President anywhere tell her that Sheldon won’t be able to come,\" Austin told her since he didn’t see Annabelle anywhere in the common hall.\nValerie hummed in response, \"Okay.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"You aren’t surprised?\"\nValerie tilted her head, \"You didn’t know? They are secretly dating...well, only the council members know about it but it is rumored that they are hiding their relationship because of political reasons.\"\nAustin tilted his head, matching her, as he said, \"Duke Runebound and Rothaux family...yeah, there is indeed a feud between them. I remember sorting out Rothaux’s previous month’s sales report, and Runbound’s territory wasn’t on the list.\"\nValerie suddenly remembered something that she wanted to ask, so she asked right away, \"Austin...if your father requests you to take care of the administration more actively...will you be dropping off from the academy?\"\nValerie had a feeling that such a situation would arise soon since, after Aiden’s death, there should be someone from the family who could take care of the administration.\nAlthough Austin has declared that he wouldn’t succeed to the throne under any circumstances, Valerie feared that he would be left with no option once the current king becomes incapable of holding the reins.\nAustin first finished chewing the sandwich he bit onto before; without looking at her, he asked, \"Did you forget that there is someone else other than me who can handle the throne better than me?\"\nValerie was surprised, \"You mean to say...Averis?\"\nThe youngest sibling and someone who barely steps out of her room these days. The only Princess and Austin’s younger sister, Averis von Eryndor.\nAustin nodded, \"She is one of the finest managers I have ever come across, and she has been taught by one the greatest advisors of all time, the Queen. She awoke a Shard at the age of six and has risen to rank A without much training.\"\nSide-glancing at her, he asked, \"Imagine what would happen once she gets out of her hibernation and decides to sharpen her skills?\"\nValerie asked, \"But will she? Didn’t she just randomly shut herself inside her room one day and didn’t tell anyone the reason?\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Well, I know the reason and I know that I can bring her out as well.\" After all, the reason she locked herself in was because she was hurt by her dear older brother, that is, Austin.\nAlthough Averis didn’t have a significant role in the plot and only appeared when Austin was scolded by Rhea and told to apologize to her, this time around, things would be different.\nAfter all, Austin was not a game character, and he wouldn’t apologize to Averis because someone told him or because of some selfish desires.\nA brother owes an apology to his sister.\n°°°°°°°\nNot so long after, Austin returned to the room and informed Sheldon that he didn’t spot Anna in the common hall so he relayed the message to Valerie.\n\"You even told her....\" He spoke with a groan.\nAustin raised his brows, \"As the chief of the Disciplinary department, she already knows everything between you two.\" He honestly confessed.\nSheldon heaved a sigh, \"And now you know too...the Prince of the nation. I hope you won’t mention it to my father.\"\nIt was the first time for Austin to hear the silverhead speaking so much. Sheldon is kind of similar to Valerie in the class—only minding their own businesses. Well, Valerie does speak often when he is around, but Sheldon...he always in his protagonist zone.\nAustin shrugged at the question, as he said, \"Well, rest assured. Since you are hiding it, the reason must be quite serious.\"\nSheldon’s expression turned grim for a moment, as he nodded, \"You can say that.\"\nAustin exhaled a sigh, \"Okay then, see you in a few hours.\"\nSheldon was rendered speechless that the guy didn’t even try to ask what was the matter, and went to sleep right away.\nWell, forget that. He will sleep too.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Rhea was pretty excited about the ceremony. It was the first time she would be seeing so many students across the globe, gathered at one place.\nAnd not only just any students, they are the best ones, selected from thousands to participate here.\nThat’s why she changed her dress and wore her school uniform—not choosing the gown she brought along—and after doing a light makeup, she said,\n\"I am going ahead, Elara.\" The redhead hummed as she continued to sleep. The way she seemed, it was highly unlikely she would reach there anytime soon.\nBut well, Rhea had already tried waking her up thrice, but all she did was groan and complain.\nOnce she ensured that she was looking appropriate, she made her way out of the room—only to find, \"Valerie.\"\nShe was passing by but halted upon hearing the voice.\n\"Hello,\" she greeted her before continuing to walk.\nRhea wasn’t surprised by that nonchalance, but she couldn’t let go of this chance to enter the ceremony with someone she knew, that’s why she instantly rushed towards Valerie and started walking beside her.\nThe ceremonial hall was in a different building, and they could reach there after passing by the common hall.\n’I should have eaten something...’ Smelling such an appetizing fragrance in the common hall, the pinkhead felt her stomach demanding some food.\nShe slept for most of the hours, and when she woke up, it was already too late. That’s why Rhea couldn’t get time to eat.\n’I hope they have something prepared for the banquet...’ With those thoughts, the two stunning ladies made their way to the place where several other students were heading.\nThe ceremonial hall was a big hollow sphere with a triangle pattern carved on the outer wall.\nThere was a huge entrance to the place, and Rhea could already hear the pleasant music from the inside.\n’Why do I feel nervous all of a sudden...’ She glanced at Valerie and the girl was totally unfazed, as if this was just another usual day of her life.\n’How does she manage to keep her expression so indifferent...does she train for that, as well?’ Rhea could never understand.\nEntering the ceremonial hall, Rhea was met by the sight she was expecting.\nThe warm glow of chandeliers bathed the room in golden light, casting gentle shadows on the polished marble floor. The air carried a mix of subtle perfumes and the faint aroma of fresh flowers arranged in tall, elegant vases around the hall.\nStudents from different academies were gathered in small groups, chatting with easy smiles. Some laughed lightly, their eyes sparkling with excitement, while others stood poised, their conversations calm and refined. The soft clinking of glasses echoed now and then as servers moved through the crowd, offering refreshments on silver trays.\nRhea let out a breath, feeling both thrilled and slightly out of place. She noticed a group nearby, discussing something animatedly.\n\"Did you see the lineup? This year’s participants are exceptional,\" a young man in a dark blue uniform remarked, adjusting his cufflinks.\nA girl in a flowing emerald-green dress responded with a chuckle. \"Exceptional? More like terrifying. I heard one of them can cast spells without even chanting.\"\n\"That just makes things more exciting, doesn’t it?\" another student grinned, sipping from a crystal glass.\nRhea noticed that many students were glancing in her direction...or more like, they were looking at the person beside her. Discover more stories at .Côm\n\"Hey, is she ....\" One of the boys from the group asked in a daze.\n\"Yeah...S-rank.\"\n\"Damn, she is a beauty.\"\n\"Hey, let’s go talk to her.\"\n\"Are you kidding me? I can tell from this far that she doesn’t care about etiquette and will outright ignore us.\"\nWell, Rhea wasn’t sure about the etiquette part but yes, Valerie would indeed ignore them.\n’The only person who can talk to her without reservation is still not here...’ Rhea ran her eyes around the venue but couldn’t find Austin anywhere.\nGlancing at Valerie, it seemed that even though she had a poised and calm front, her eyes were restlessly moving around the place.\nRhea smiled with a shake of her head when she suddenly heard,\n\"Hey, isn’t he the top student from Ravenshade this year?\"\n\"Yeah....damn, look at those muscles.\"\n\"Haah~so hot~\"\nRhea heard some weird whispers of the girls from nearby before she turned to her left.\n\"Hello, there.\" Suddenly, a black-haired man appeared before them—his tall frame completely blocked the vision of others.\nHe had a smile on his face as he said, \"You are Corwon Valerie, right? I was really looking forward to meeting you.\"\nValerie’s eyes were, as usual, emotionless, as she asked, \"Do I know you?\"\n\"Ah, yeah, sorry. I am Kevin from the Auroracrest Academy. I have heard several things about you, including your contribution to saving Drenovar.\"\nValerie muttered, \"Okay.\" Saying so, she turned away and left—leaving a flustered Kevin behind.\n...did he offend her?\nThe boy then turned toward the other person and was surprised to see her eyes widen and her lips slightly widen.\n\"Umm...are you okay?\" He asked as he waved his hand in front of her face.\nRhea was broken out of her daze, before she hurriedly said, \"Yes, I am fine...that name...someone close to me also had that name.\"\nKevin blinked, \"Oh, is that so. Well, he must be really special for you to react so strongly.\"\nRhea lowered her eyes, a smile lifting the edges of her lips, as she said, \"Yes...he was. My first friend.\"\n....\nAustin reached the venue in a rush.\nHe really shouldn’t have trusted Sheldon to wake him up.\nThat guy was still sleeping!\nHe got up just ten minutes ago, took a quick shower, and changed his clothes before reaching here.\n’Val must be waiting for me....’\nHe rushed into the ceremonial hall and finally came to a halt.\nRoaming his eyes around he tried to find the prettiest girl in the hall.\nHowever, even after looking around, he couldn’t find her.\n*Tap*\nFeeling the tap on his shoulder, Austin’s shoulders slumped as he said, \"I am really sorry, Val-\" However, his words died once he turned to look at the person who called him out.\nAustin’s face turned pale and his lips were parted in shock upon seeing the person.\nNumerous thoughts came rushing to his mind, as a name seeped through his lips,\n\"M-Monica...?\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "He couldn’t forget her. The girl he was in a relationship with for months before they ’mutually’ decided that Monica was not worthy to be with Luke. And they broke up.\nThat long black hair, that almond-shaped face...even though her eyes were now blue, she seemed the exact same as the day Luke last saw her.\nHowever, the most important question was...how and why was she here?\nAnother reincarnation? Did she die that night with him? Or does she look the same?\nHundreds of questions which sounded almost identical, overcrowded his head as Austin stared at the girl with his eyes widened.\nShe smiled, before speaking, \"I think you mistook me for someone else. Just like how I did.\" Her voice was...different from what he remembered, but that face...how can someone have such an identical face?\nIt took Austin a moment to collect himself before he asked, \"Did you need something from me?\" He looked down at her blazer and found she was from the Avalon Academy, which was situated in Hener.\nThe girl smilingly shook her head, \"As I said, I thought you were someone else. And it seems you made the same mistake. By the way, who is this Monica? Your girlfriend?\"\nAustin narrowed his eyes as he shook his head, \"No, a person with an annoying attitude and someone I want to forget about. Anyway, since I am not the one you are looking for, see you.\" He didn’t want to talk to her for long...his heart rate was not in his control for obvious reasons.\nThe reasons were two. First was that he absolutely dreaded anyone reincarnating from Earth to this world—for hundreds of reasons. And second was, Austin’s past feelings for her.\nAlthough he has moved on, and now he has someone whom he loves more than anyone in the world, the deep wounds Monica inflicted on him still remain. And when he came across someone who looked just like her...it was natural for him to be reminded of that regrettable past.\nAustin took a cup of fruit beer and gulped it down to cool his head—when suddenly, \"Are you okay?\"\nHearing the voice, it felt like half of his worries had already faded. And the rest of the worries were taken care of when Austin turned towards her and hugged his lover.\n\"Val...\" Was he making her worried? Yes. However, he really wanted to hug her.\nValerie wordlessly embraced her lover. She didn’t know what happened, but when she saw Austin walking away from the strange girl, he looked quite disturbed...as if he was suffering.\nIf she had known that in her absence someone could upset her Lord this much, she wouldn’t have gone to help the President.\nAnd now she was regretting it.\nOnce Austin calmed down, he separated from the girl, and with their hands connected, he said, \"Sorry about that. That person reminded me of someone I’d rather not think about.\"\n\"Is it something that I don’t know? Can you tell me?\" She asked, her round big eyes looking at him with an upturned glance.\nHowever, despite his promise to never lie to her, Austin couldn’t bring himself to reveal the truth.\nHe...was scared. A past in which Austin was Luke. Although Austin and Luke were the same people since Austin just simply unlocked Luke’s memories, telling it to Valerie would mean a completely different thing.\nIf she gets to know everything that changed Austin’s attitude towards her and the fact that Austin isn’t completely him...he doesn’t have a good feeling about how she would react.\nThat’s why, \"....not something major. Just a childhood incident Anyway, where were you?\"\nIt would have been a little nice if Valerie couldn’t have noticed how he just skipped over a very important topic. However, she did.\nBut since he chose to hide it from her, she decided to not push him and wait for the time when he could disclose it to her.\nWith a soft smile extending her lips, she said, \"Went to help the President. Her uniform was a little damaged.\"\nAustin hummed as the conversation continued in the natural flow.\nHe was guilty, yes. But it would be better if Valerie never came to know about the person named Luke.\n....\nThe students were mingling with others. It was a very good opportunity for nobles from different nations to form connections.\nSome just took a corner and enjoyed the evening with a glass of beverage in their hand. While some were actively approaching strangers and exchanging greetings.\nIn one corner, there was a certain purple-haired male who stood at his place with his head slightly leaned down, and from afar, it could be regarded as if he was taking a nap while standing.\nHowever, the person was good at hiding where his eyes were directed.\nWhether she went, his eyes followed.\nOne of the Elites from the Avalon Academy, and someone who is using a fake identity to participate in the tournament.\nFake name: Esner. Real identity: the Prince of Hener, Parkinson.\nHe was finally here, after crossing a rocky path of getting admitted to the academy under a fake identity and making his appearance in the tournament.\nThere were many who raised their voice against his participation since Esner was new to the academy and surely would be hard to deal with during team matches.\nHowever, since he had the support of the Nation’s Supreme, Parkinson never felt threatened about his spot in the squad.\nAnd finally, he was here...where he wanted to be.\nHis eyes finally found relief after they caught the sight of his favorite person.\nIt has been thirty-one days, eighteen hours since he last saw her.\nIt was a very depressing phase for him to be away from the only person whom he came to love so much.\nThe sole reason he still hasn’t lost his cool and attacked Austin.\nHis Rhea.\n\"Dude, you need to wind down a little.\" Someone approached him from the left, and without looking, Esner could tell that it was the captain of the Elite team. Your journey continues at .Côm\n\"Quinton...I was in my relaxed zone...until you came to disturb me.\"\nHearing the words, the shaved-headed boy grinned, as he draped his hand over Esner’s shoulder, making the other one annoyed, as he said, \"You are checking out the girls, right? Well, can’t be blamed. So many flowers...but unluckily, the top-tier ones already have owners. Just like that girl, over there.\"\nHe pointed at Valerie and Austin, who were chatting to each other without a care in the world. They really don’t care about anyone else when they are with each other.\n\"Or...that one.\" He then pointed at Rhea who was accompanied by Rudolph. Although they weren’t as cozy as the previous couple, whoever saw them could only tell that they were a nice couple.\nParkinson’s eyes narrowed as he said, \"Don’t trust what your eyes tell you. Not everyone is focused on dating here.\"\n\"Heeh~don’t tell me, you are jealous~Well, if you want you can try on Jasmine. She seemed to be interested in you.\"\nWhen the Captain mentioned Jasmine...Parkinson’s eyes also traveled to the raven-haired girl.\nThere was something that caught his attention this evening, and that was her conversation with Austin.\nHe looked quite restless after exchanging a few words with her. What could she possibly say?\nAnd considering Valerie’s nature, if she didn’t go to confront the girl, then possibly the matter wasn’t that big or...Austin hid it from her?\n’Interesting...I guess I should talk to Jasmine a little more...’\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Here comes the antagonist.\nI want to give a spoiler about whether Austin would reveal his past to Valerie or not?

      "content": "Austin’s mood improved by being near his favorite person. It really helps when you are with someone who not only understands your inner turmoil but also says things that can help you get over it.\nThey tried a few dishes being served and a few people came to greet them.\nWhile he was at it, Austin glanced around him and found the one he was looking forward to meeting.\nThe fourth target character: Kevin.\nHe was the childhood friend of Rhea and someone who would play a key role during the tournament.\nHaving a Shard that detects the demonic presence and uses the power of the sun to eradicate them—yeah, a cheat ability.\nNot only that, he was on the verge of breaking into S-rank.\n’He may get the chance to level up soon...’\nAustin has a bad feeling that during this tournament, the Beast King, the demon who attacked Drenovar, will ambush the tournament.\nCanonically, he would have secretly recruited a few of those students who lost in their first round. And once he gathers hefty soldiers, he would have attacked from the front—ruining the whole competition, only for Rhea and Kevin to bring him down in the end.\nFighting with Rhea would have helped Kevin remember his childhood and the friend he got detached from. And voila, Rhea would get herself another love interest.\n’My concern is on the demon...now that he knows that Valerie is a part of the students’ body, will he change his strategy?’ After all, canonically, Valerie—an S-rank—shouldn’t have been here. Not only that, the Demon General has even fought with her, so he knows Valerie’s strength.\nAnd these few changes leave Austin completely lost on what the Demon would be plotting.\n\"Are you tired?\" Valerie’s concerned voice woke him up from his daze.\nHe smilingly shook his head, \"Was just thinking about the matches. It would be great if we could remain on the same team. You know...my first time and all.\"\nValerie held his hand assuringly, as she said, \"Regardless of which team you participate from, I know you will be victorious. And not only that, you would be playing a key role in your team’s victory.\"\nAustin was rendered speechless. How can someone be so sure about someone else’s abilities?\nHer faith in him puts him under slight pressure, but the motivation he gains from it is immense.\nHe squeezed her hand and told her, \"You are right. I am going to win this.\"\nWhile they were lost in their world and were completely unbothered by the people whispering and glancing in their way, someone suddenly walked to the stage.\n\"Can I have your attention, please? The Chairman wants to relay a few words.\" It was a man in a black suit who garnered everyone’s attention before he politely gave a bow to the students and backed away.\nAustin and Valerie also turned towards the stage, and they saw an elderly man with long white hair that reached his shoulders and a pair of amethyst eyes appearing on the stage.\nThere was something about his presence that created pin-drop silence in the ceremonial hall as he addressed the participants,\n\"First of all, congratulations. You’ve overcome countless challenges through sheer determination and skill to stand here today. Out of thousands, you were chosen, and that alone is proof of your worth. No matter the outcome, remember this—you are already champions. But don’t stop here. Strive to be even greater.\"\nHis voice was tranquil as if he was helping the excited hearts to calm down.\n’The chairman eh...the head of the council that is responsible for organizing the tournament and an A-rank.’ Austin didn’t have much of an impression of the man other than the fact that everyone working under him and many of the students respected him for his past records.\nOnce a top student of Ravencourt Academy and someone who pushed his team to become the third-time winner of the tournament.\nRavencourt Academy has always produced immense talent and championed students. Three of the ten S-ranks in the world come from that academy.\nThat’s why, they wanted to bring Valerie to their side as well. Since in their eyes, she wouldn’t reach the peak of her strength while being in a small academy as Valorian.\nThe Chairman continued, \"Over the years, my fellow council members and I have observed that teamwork and coordination are key factors in overcoming the first hurdle—the squad matches. Time and again, we’ve seen stronger teams falter simply because they couldn’t synchronize their efforts. And for them, it’s a bitter truth to swallow, because in the end, even the mightiest wolf must learn that true strength isn’t always found in solitude.\"\nHis tone turned serious near the end, and his gaze hardened, which made Austin frown.\nShouldn’t this welcoming speech have ended by now? Why does it seem the man is here to deliver a very important information?\nEveryone felt that there was something about to happen. And their anticipation wasn’t unwarranted,\n\"That is why we have decided to give everyone a chance to prove their individual strength. Instead of starting with team battles, this time, the tournament will begin with solo matches.\"\n\"...!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What the ...\"\n\"Is he being serious?\"\nSuddenly, a round of gasps spread across the hall as they heard the announcement.\nIt has been a tradition for years for the tournament to flow in the same usual manner: squad matches followed by duo matches and ending with solo battles.\nThen how...and why did they change the rules all of a sudden?\nAustin frowned, as he somehow realized the reason.\nHis eyes turned toward a certain man with black hair, standing with his team. Stay updated via .Côm\nThere is not one but two S-rank participating this year. That’s why, they must have thought that rather than letting the team benefit from the S-rank warriors, let them first face their individual battles.\nValerie, on the other hand, was slightly nervous about this change.\nShe was aware that Austin might be the lowest-ranking warrior in the tournament, and anyone he would be facing would surely be B-rank or above. Most probably, above.\nShe glanced at her lover, evident concern written over her face.\nBut when Austin held her hand gently and whispered, \"I promised that I would participate in the duo match with you, and I will fulfill my promise.\"\n...she felt all her concern melting under his warm gaze.\nThat’s right, even though the situation has changed, she should trust her Lord.\nHe has always proven everyone wrong with his wits and strength.\nA few weeks ago, no one could even have imagined for him to defeat a B-rank warrior. But he did, that’s why he is here.\nLooking at their connected hands, she muttered, \"We will win this...together.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "The next morning, all eight members of the Elite team were told to gather in the canopy tent provided to them by the management. Not only them but all the eight teams were provided separate tents to do the preparation and discussions.\nThe eight from the Rookie department were gathered for a meeting in a different section of the same tent, while Annabelle took charge of discussing things with the Elite team.\nThere were two benches on either side of the table and a long whiteboard on which Anna wrote ’POINTS.’\n\"Let’s talk about the sudden change brought by the council before we get onto the points distribution they have chosen.\" The points distribution per match has also changed, naturally, since the pattern of the tournament has changed as well.\nAustin was sitting beside Valerie while wearing his training gear, as he and the others heard the President and the Captain of the Elite department speaking, Explore more adventures at .Côm\n\"We all knew that the most points a school could have earned were from the squad matches which happened in the beginning. However, things have changed. Because they are testing each student, they would be providing points based on how many students from each academy pass the first round.\"\nSaying so, she wrote on the board: Per student a hundred points.\n\"..!!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Woah…\"\nThat took everyone by surprise since the squad matches only offered two hundred points, and here, if every student passes their matches, a single academy would gain eight hundred points—a huge initial head start.\n\"Isn’t that a lot? Victory in every match would put any team in a dominant position.\" Sheldon asked in a grim voice.\n\"That’s right. However, it’s highly unlikely that any academy would get to have all their warriors in the second round, so rather than focusing on winning all matches, our focus should be on winning as many matches as we can. Not only because of the points but also because…having less than four qualified students would disqualify us from the tournament.\" Anna delivered very concern-worthy news.\nHowever, it was expected. If four members couldn’t pass the first round, then it has been the rule of the Tournament to not let losers continue in the tournament.\n\"So, like, if four of us don’t pass the first stage, we would be asked to pack our bags and bye-bye, huh?\" Rudolph sighed.\n\"We can be dragged down because of others’ failure in this…totally unfair.\" Elara exasperatedly muttered as she glanced at Austin—only to feel a chill running down her spine when her eyes went toward the pair of dead eyes staring at her soul.\n\"Guys, don’t be so pessimistic. We all have proven our worth to be here and have prepared for this so surely we won’t lose just like that.\" Rhea suddenly got up and tried to calm down the situation. In her opinion, these people are the best warriors she has come across. That’s why it was a little confusing for her why they were being so negative and concerned.\n\"If you don’t know among our competitors is Ravencourt and Auroracrest academies. They have been battling at the top for the winner’s position for the past couple of years. Every year, our academy either doesn’t reach the final round or if they do, we always have lost in one-on-one battles.\" Ryan spoke to the over-enthusiast girl.\n\"But we have Valerie this year!\" Rhea spoke in retaliation while gesturing toward the violette beside her.\nValerie heaved a sigh as she suddenly got up and Rhea instantly sat down. Every mouth that opened to say something, instantly shut down as Valerie stood beside Annabelle.\nWith her hands behind her back, she uttered, \"Until we don’t cross the first round, we don’t need any discussion since, during the first round, it would all depend on our individual abilities. So rather than depending on others or fearing about other’s performance, go and train for your matches. After all, on the battlefield, we all would be standing all alone.\"\nThose words left no room for any question or discussion. After all, what Valerie said was true.\nOnce she was done, she returned to where she had been sitting previously.\nAustin held her hand and gave a soft nod to the girl.\nAnna nodded as she said, \"As Valerie pointed out, there’s little point in arguing over things we can’t control. Since we don’t know who we’ll be facing, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of our potential opponents is irrelevant.\"\nA few nodded while a few just remained silent.\nSince there was nothing else to discuss, the students were told to return to their rooms.\nAustin and Valerie were making their way out of the tent when suddenly, Rudolph called out, \"Wanna spar?\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"You sure? Won’t you get bored?\" In the past, they stopped sparring because Rudolph continued to grow, while Austin remained stuck at the same level, and eventually, Rudolph lost interest in sparring against him.\nRudolph said, \"You have and will again defeat an enemy higher in rank than you…I don’t think I can take you lightly anymore.\"\nValerie smiled upon hearing that and she also encouraged, \"Don’t under-evaluate yourself, Austin. I know you would be considerably challenging even for an A-rank.\"\nAustin smiled upon hearing her words, as he shrugged and said, \"Well, I was going to train anyways. Let’s do it like old times.\"\nThe four of them, adding Rhea to the group, reached the training hall provided to the students.\nNaturally, providing everyone a separate training hall was impossible.\nOnly a huge hall was provided, but it was spacious enough for everyone to take their corners and train as they usually do.\n\"Hmm…\" Austin hummed in surprise seeing and hearing those loud noises of the collision between the students.\nThere were a few who were standing out a lot. And there were a few who were even using their shard, even though that was a risky move in Austin’s eyes.\nSeeing those blurry figures and the massive dents in the training hall forming because of the pressure behind those attacks, Austin muttered under his breath,\n’The competition is going to be one hell of tough.’\n------^^------\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed reading the chapter.

      "content": "Austin was back in his room after a long training session with Rudolph followed by Valerie.\nIt was a sight to behold when Valerie and Rudolph were sparring though. Two warriors who have walked on the path of greatness, and have been shaping them to become what they are right now.\nSadly, if Austin has to fight someone of Rudoplph’s caliber in the first round, there are very few chances for him to come out victorious.\n\"Are you going to use the bathroom?\" Austin asked as he prepared to go in.\nSheldon shook his head, \"You go first, I take a long time.\"\nAustin smiled wryly, it was the same for him. But well, he took the proposal and went inside.\nThere was a round bathing pool on the ground, just like it was in the academy.\nSteaming warm water was waiting for him as Austin stripped off his clothes and dove in.\nHaah~heavens.\nHe enjoyed the sensation for a few moments, before redirecting his focus on the battle tomorrow.\nHis match was scheduled on the first day, and Austin would be the first one performing from the Valorian Academy.\nNow, the question arises…what can he use during the battle?\nAny skill which can be visible to others would be quite dangerous. After all, no participants were allowed to carry any artifact during the battle. So using the Absolute Barrier is a no-go. Unless…he wants to get interrogated for being a demon worshiper.\nHowever, he can take his boomerang with him since bringing additional weapons other than one’s Shard is allowed.\nWhat would be useful during the battle was his skills like Adapt. Borrowing someone else’s Shard is a no-no as well.\n’It’s so infuriating…having the skills yet not allowed to use them,’ Shaking his head, he heaved a sigh and rested his head on edge.\nIf only his match had been scheduled a little later, he could have upgraded his stats using the Dungeon. But the lady luck was not on his side these days, it seems.\n’Well, I will do what I can...’ Closing his eyes he decided to let his mind and body attain some peace.\n°°°°°°°°°\n\"Isn’t this clear partiality? Didn’t we decide to choose the names based on lots?\" One of the four members of the management voiced his protest.\nIn the room, the four of them were deciding the matches of the participants for the following week.\nEvery day, around sixteen matches would be held, with Elite and Rookie divisions distributed equally.\nSince they didn’t get the information about who would be participating in the contest very late, they couldn’t decide the matches beforehand.\nThat’s why, because being short of time, they decided to draw lots and decide the opponents the student would be facing during the first round.\nSince every Elite here was above B-rank, it wouldn’t be an unfair matchup. Although there are extreme powerhouses performing this year, like Valerie Corwon or Kevin from the Ravencourt, there was nothing the management could do to help their opponent.\nWhen these students decided to take part in this contest, they should have prepared themselves to face stronger opponents.\nThat’s why they were about to proceed with the lottery system to decide who would be facing whom during the tournament’s first round. But then suddenly, the orders came to put a certain student against a B-rank warrior from the Avalon Academy.\nThe special student was also the weakest student participating in the Elite division.\nAustin von Eryndor.\n\"Who is supporting him? And why can’t we, the members of Council, oppose them?\" Another member asked the one who relayed the command.\nThe man with a black mustache and bald head sighed as he informed them, \"It is the Chairman of the committee. But it’s not like he told me to put Austin against a B-rank of his own volition. He also received an order from higher up.\"\nHearing his words, everyone else was stunned. Someone gave orders to the Chairman...the only people who came to their minds were,\n\"The Council Heads....but why are they interfering with this tournament?\"\nIn the past, the head of the Union Council has never shown interest in the tournament since they have much bigger and more crucial work at hand.\nAnd now, all of a sudden, they are showing concern for a small kingdom’s prince? That’s too absurd.\nThe bald one looked tired as he said, \"Regardless of the reason, we have no choice but—\" bringing a certain name beside Austin on the roster, he said, \"—follow what we are told.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nThe next day, in the early morning, Austin went for a light run and refrained from training. His body has recovered quite well, and considering his match was in a few hours, he decided to do some light exercise.\nAustin met Valerie near the Command Tent, as she stood with a towel in her hand.\n\"Thanks,\" While breathing slightly roughly, Austin took the cold towel, before wiping his sweat.\nValerie offered him some water as well, as she said, \"How do you feel? Is your body working properly?\" She was slightly stressed since she thought that Austin pushed himself a little too far yesterday.\nAustin first gulped down half the bottle, before telling her, \"Completely fit and fine. Now I just need to get in there and defeat whoever appears before me.\"\nValerie felt relieved seeing his enthusiasm. It felt like her heart was getting some much-needed relief, seeing such optimism from him.\nSoon, a few others joined them, and one of them said, \"I know you can do it, Austin. Just use your clever mind and let the other one taste dust.\" Rhea cheered for him, with an energetic smile on her face.\n\"You got it, bro. Just don’t let them beat you up to analyze them. If you can, one-shot your enemy.\" Rudolph added.\nAustin chuckled, \"It’s highly unlikely for something like that to happen...but I will try.\" Well, not a single warrior participating is a newbie or low-ranker.\nSo taking them down with one strike was nearly impossible.\nSoon, Annabelle added, \"Regardless of the results, Austin, know that we all are a team, okay.\"\nAustin nodded, thankful for her words. However, he doesn’t need consolation, neither before the match nor after.\nSince he was going to win today, regardless of who appeared before him.\n°°°°°°°°\nAustin and Valerie were left alone as they headed towards the common hall to have a light breakfast.\n\"Did you receive your schedule?\" Austin asked as he returned to the table while holding a tray of cereals and some fruits for both of them.\nValerie nodded, \"My match is the day after tomorrow.\" She didn’t sound nervous about it, and that’s pretty cool in Austin’s eyes.\nHe sat down beside her and asked her, \"So Val, what’s the reward this time?\"\nValerie was taken aback as her lashes fluttered rapidly, \"What do you mean?\"\nAustin told her, \"Last time, the promise of reward helped me a lot. So, I want one this time as well. Tell me, what are you going to give me?\"\nValerie was instantly reminded of that...kiss, under the stairs. She still hasn’t forgotten a single moment she spent in those minutes.\nShe lowered her head, trying to hide her face, as she said, \"W-What do you want?\"\nAustin hummed smilingly before he said, \"Nothing too big...how about a baby?\"\n\"....\" Emergency! A participant fainted before even the matches began!\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading, and I am double-minded about R-18. If you really don’t like it, then I will put a warning so you can skip it.

      "content": "Pink hair appeared in the corner of his vision as Austin approached the preparation room in the afternoon.\nHe was told that his match would be in thirty minutes so he was rushing there.\nNaturally, Valerie wasn’t with him since no one other than the participants could be in the preparation room. He told her to sit in the stands and cheer for him.\n\"Hey, are you going in?\" Rhea asked as she stopped before him.\nAustin blinked, \"Why are you here? Is there anyone else fighting other than me from Valorian?\" Last he remembered he was the only one for today.\nRhea shook her head with a smile, as she said, \"Just was talking to someone and got distracted where I was headed. Someone from the Avalon Academy.\"\nShe met a really nice person who helped her find ways.\nShe never thought that a stranger could have such a gentle personality.\nAustin hummed, before telling her, \"Well, good for you. See you later.\"\n\"Yes, see you. Best of luck, Austin!\" Saying so, Rhea continued to walk through the gallery which led to the arena.\nWhile Austin walked towards the preparation room, he asked the system, ’Can you give me a quest to elevate my Combat stats?’\nHe has been thinking that he wasn’t using the QoD often, and that’s very stupid of him. After all, all the quests assigned from the system are always aligned with what he is looking for progress.\nHe could have asked for a quest when he dives into the dungeon; after all, that place is his battleground to manipulate. He can use the opportunity to enhance his specific stats.\nAnd since there is an option to reject quests up to two times—if they appear to be too absurd—he can take the risk.\n[Ding!] Continue reading on .Côm\n[Are you sure you want to use QoD for your combat enhancement?]\n[Y/N]\nWithout thinking much, Austin chose the ’Y’.\n[Ding!]\n[Generating quest....]\n[Assessing current status....]\n[Ding!]\n[Quest: Defeat your opponent within five minutes after the match begins!]\n[Reward: +15 combat, 50 Points]\n\"...\" Austin paused for a moment when he saw the quest.\nDefeating his enemy in five minutes? He still doesn’t know whom he is fighting so taking the worst possibility into consideration, he was supposed to face an A-rank and defeat them within five minutes, eh?\n’Sound impossible, but I won’t know until I try.’\nWith those thoughts, he entered the preparation room and found he was the only one there.\nThere were several benches around the room and attached to the wall.\nThere was a long slim window that gave the vision outside.\nAustin slowly approached the window and looked outside—only to freeze in shock as he found a huge figure was thrown in his direction.\n*Bham*\nThe person collided against the frame of the window, but no damage was dealt to the preparation room.\nAustin shifted to the right and looked at the person who so brutally defeated his enemy.\nThe loud cheering from the audience made it clear that they had quite a spectacle while witnessing the battle.\nAnd when Austin’s eyes landed on the person, he realized that the hype was warranted.\n’Kevin...a being who would play a crucial role during the final arc.’ He is the true nemesis of darkness. Someone who can even negate the effect of the Dark water.\nIf this has been an eroge game, then Kevin might have been the protagonist.\nRegardless of what happens now, Austin was prepared to deal with things his way. He wouldn’t be depending on the main cast.\nBefore the Demon Lord resurrects, he would gain enough strength and skills from the system to stand against that calamity.\n\"Oh, hello.\" Not so long after, Kevin entered the preparation room after his match was finished.\nAustin nodded at the guy, \"Nice match. It seems the opponent wasn’t very difficult for you.\" He talked to him casually since they conversed yesterday at the banquet as well. Although briefly.\nKevin rubbed the back of his head, \"It seems he was a B-rank...and I went a little too hard with him. In the excitement of participating in the tournament for the first time, I went overhead.\"\nAustin shrugged, \"Well until you don’t break any rules, it’s all good.\"\nKevin laughed dryly before he sat down on the bench and took some water.\nThe battleground was getting rearranged. Some workers were cleaning the ground, and some were repairing the surface using their Shards and artifacts.\n\"By the way, I heard you are a D-rank?\" Kevin asked suddenly.\nAustin crossed his hand as he casually asked back, \"How do you know about it?\"\nKevin was flustered, \"Please don’t misunderstand. I didn’t inquire about you and Miss Valerie because you defeated so many demons in Drenovar.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"It means you did. Well, you are right; the last evaluation I had said that I am a D-rank.\"\nKevin blinked in confusion, \"And about your Shard?\"\nAustin summoned his Frostfang, as he said, \"Still at stage zero.\"\nKevin was flabbergasted, \"Yet you were able to defeat an A-rank? Crazy....\"\nAustin laughed lightly, \"I had help, you know. And it’s not like you can judge someone based on their rank. After all, I heard that the Great Kane who defeated the Demon Lord was also an E-rank for most of his life.\"\nKevin thumped his fist on his palm, \"You are right about that. I heard how the Hero and his partners went to different continents and gallantly defeated the Demon Generals before going against the Monarch of Darkness. And despite being irregular they were able to leave such a deep impact on the world.\"\nAustin hummed, \"But it’s slightly frustrating as well-\"\n\"That we know nothing about Lord Kane’s team members, right?\" Kevin added, which ushered Austin to nod.\nThe raven-haired boy heaved a sigh, \"Well, there must have been a significant reason why Savior Kane never revealed who helped him get over such a big crisis.\"\nAustin hummed in assent before both of them fell silent.\nNot so long after someone came and told Austin to step out.\nKevin got up and said, \"I wish you the best of luck, Austin. Please grace me with your presence in the second round.\" Saying so, he gave a brief bow and walked away.\nAustin chuckled, so the guy wants to fight with him, eh?\nShaking his head, he tied his shoelaces after undoing them once and gulped some water before heading out.\nThe battle begins now.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

You overwhelmed your enemy and showed him where he belongs.\" A short purple-haired girl grinned as she praised her fellow classmate.\nThe student whom Kevin crushed during his battle was from Stellthorne Academy, and the Elites who heard the girl’s words were gritting their teeth but couldn’t say anything here.\nSome were ashamed of their teammate’s performance and some just didn’t want to look like a fool.\nKevin shook his head as he said, \"You shouldn’t talk about someone like that, Cassie. It was a bad match; otherwise, he surely would have shown why he was chosen for this tournament.\"\nSaying so, the teenager sat down beside his teammate.\nThe girl, Cassie, grinned upon hearing that as she said, \"Talking about a bad match-up, the next match is of a D-rank, right?\"\nRhea flinched and every member of the Valorian academy, except for Sheldon and Ryan, directed their pleading gaze in Valerie’s direction.\nThe captain of Ravencourt glared at the girl before saying, \"Sit down and watch the match. If you really want to provoke someone, do that when you are facing her on the battlefield.\"\nThose cold words made Cassie sneer, \"You think I will hesitate?\"\nThe Captain no longer paid attention to the girl and looked at the arena.\nCassie rolled her eyes before she also sat down and watched the two contestants making their way to the center of the arena.\nEsner(Parkinson) also watched intently. The last time he fought Austin, he underestimated his combat skills and was humiliated in front of everyone. And most of all, Rhea.\nSince then, he doesn’t know how much he has grown...but still in front of a B-rank...Esner was unsure if Austin could pull something off here when he had no one to support him.\n’It would be satisfying to see you losing like a dog~’\n.....\nStanding in the arena Austin looked at his opponent.\nIt was a girl with long green hair, which she had braided, and she was wearing the battle gear of the Avalon Academy.\nShe wore a confident smile on her face and in her left hand was her Shard in the shape of a rope.\nAustin has memorized every person participating as an Elite in this tournament, and from what he knows, his opponent has agile feet but weak defense. There was no information about her Shard he could obtain, though.\n\"My name is Lucy. Nice to meet you.\"\nAustin nodded at her greetings, as he said, \"I am Austin.\"\nOnce the greetings were over, the referee stepped in before announcing, \"The match will last for ten minutes. Victory is achieved by knocking out your opponent or forcing their submission. Lethal attacks are strictly forbidden—any attempt will result in immediate disqualification and expulsion from your academy.\"\nAustin nodded upon hearing that and so did Lucy.\nThe referee stepped back before raising his left hand.\n\"Participants, ready?\"\nGetting a nod from both sides, the referee declared, \"BEGIN!\"\nJust as those words left his mouth, Austin’s feet and arm moved in sync: his feet took him toward his opponent while his arm threw away Wisp.\nThe crowd gasped as Austin vanished and reappeared before Lucy in a blink, his dagger flashing toward her.\n\"Shit!\" Lucy cursed, barely twisting away in time—\nSHLINK!\nHis blade was carved into the spot she had stood just a second ago.\nMurmurs rippled through the audience. The sheer speed was unreal. Even the Elites watching leaned forward, eyes narrowing.\n\"A D-rank? Moving like that?\"\n\"Impossible.\"\nMany began to wonder—was Austin truly a D-rank, or had he been hiding his real strength all along?\nLucy lashed out with her Shard—\nSTING!\nA sharp crack split the air as something shot toward Austin. He tilted his body just in time, only to see a splash of water explode behind him, leaving a deep gash in the ground.\n’Damn… that would’ve hurt.’\nLucy landed gracefully, her feet barely touching the ground before she reshaped her Shard into a perfect ring and blew through it.\n\"The hell—!\" Austin’s instincts screamed, and he leaped back just as a swarm of bubbles shot out of the loop, streaking toward him at alarming speed.\nAt first, they seemed harmless—until—\nHIZZZZZ!\nThe moment a bubble popped against the ground, the water sizzled, eating into the surface like acid.\nAustin’s eyes widened.\n’Great. Acid bubbles. Just what I needed.’\nHe twisted and dodged, barely slipping between the deadly orbs as they came faster and faster, closing in on him from all directions.\nAustin gritted his teeth, his mind racing. The bubbles were coming too fast, forcing him on the defensive. If he kept dodging, he’d eventually slip up.\nTch!\nHe flicked his wrist, hurling his boomerang. It shot forward—but instead of cutting through the bubbles, he slowed it mid-air, letting it weave between them like a ghost.\nLucy smirked. \"Missed.\"\nBut Austin wasn’t aiming at her.\nThe moment the boomerang curved behind her, he snapped his fingers—\nWHOOSH!\nIt shot forward at blinding speed, slicing through the air toward Lucy’s blind spot.\nHer eyes widened.\nCRACK!\nShe barely managed to twist her Shard into a shield by coiling it, deflecting the attack, but the force sent her skidding backward.\nAustin took his chance. He surged forward, Shard in hand, increasing its weight mid-swing for a crushing blow.\nEveryone shifted to the edges of their seats as they thought that the battle was reaching its climax.\nHowever, maybe in a state of panic, Lucy suddenly twirled on her feet and swung her Shard with all her strength.\n*ZAP*\nFaster than he could have dodged, more so with his weighted Shard, a wave came rushing toward him, throwing Austin completely off balance.\n*SPLASH*\nHe was hurtled back, his body drenched and his Shard slipping from his hand.\nAustin coughed as what he engulfed was not truly water...his nose and eyes were burning.\nLucy didn’t miss the opportunity and jumped into the air before swirling her Shard into a tornado.\nAustin’s eyes snapped as he realized that he was getting surrounded.\nHe instantly tried to get up and move—but,\n\"*COUGH*\" His body didn’t support him when he needed it the most.\nAnd the result was—\n\"Heeh~got you,\"\n—Austin was trapped in a water prison.\nIt was a huge orb of water. Levitating above the ground. And filled completely with blue clear water.\nEveryone watched in fascination as Austin was trapped inside.\nMoving his arms, and trying to strike the walls, but to no avail.\nThe water was filled with acids that were making his skin burn, and consuming that water would mean instant defeat.\nLucy slowly approached the orb. A smile of victory on her face as she tilted her head.\nEsner had a nasty grin on his face which he hid behind his hand.\nRhea and everyone from Valorian were worried...however, the one who was the most, showed no reaction. Continue your saga on .Côm\nMany began to sneer and make fun of him,\n\"Look at that! A fucking mermaid!\"\n\"Look at those flappy hands! Awwww!\"\n\"Goddamn, she played dirty! Austin, you nooooob!\"\n\"Haah~I am ashamed that he represents the Valorian.\"\nThe ridicule was like a sweet melody to Lucy’s ears as she smilingly said, \"Sorry to say, Austin, but the insult I faced by being matched up with you, truly agitated me.\"\nAustin’s mouth was full of water as he continued to move around.\nHowever, looking closely anyone could tell that he was losing strength.\nHis eyes were red, and his body sluggish.\nThe referee was ready to stop the match if Lucy didn’t liberate him even after he lost consciousness.\nHowever, Lucy was just agitated. She didn’t hate Austin.\nThat’s why, once Austin stopped moving, and closed his eyes,\n*Snap*\n\"Agh!\"\nThe moment she snapped her fingers and the water orb collapsed, Lucy felt a powerful grip tighten around her throat.\nGasps filled the arena. Many students didn’t even register what had happened.\n\"H-How did you…?\" Lucy choked out, eyes wide with disbelief. Just moments ago, Austin had been unconscious—yet now, he stood before her, holding her in an iron grip.\nAustin panted slightly, silently thanking the system for granting him the Aqua Lungs skill in the past. Without it, he wouldn’t be standing here.\nHe clenched his fist.\nA surge of soul energy wrapped around his hand, shaking the ground beneath him.\nThe entire arena fell into stunned silence.\nLucy’s breath hitched—not because she was being choked, but because of that fist.\nTears welled in her eyes as she barely managed to whisper, \"I-I give—\"\nBOOOOOM!\nBefore she could finish, Austin’s punch slammed into her gut with an earth-shattering force.\nHer body shot across the arena like a cannonball, crashing into the wall with a deafening impact.\nAustin didn’t even glance back to check if she was conscious.\nWithout a word, he turned and walked away.\nThe referee instantly headed towards the girl who was framed in the wall, before checking on her.\nHer breathing was slow but she was alive and could be recovered.\nAs such,\n\"AUSTIN, WINS!\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- This time it was a non-combatant type.

      "content": "Austin was kind of disappointed from his first battle in the tournament.\nHe didn’t think he would be able to win so easily. Yes, he was trapped in the water prison there for a few minutes, but still if taken out that skill, the girl was quite weak in other aspects.\n’She was at least ranked B…then does that mean she was a fake ranker, or maybe someone favored her during the assessment.’ The chance is the bare minimum. Then does that mean the assessment doesn’t actually evaluate someone’s true rank?\n’If I remember right, then they give training dummies to the test-taker…’ Other than the evolution of one’s shard, what works for evaluation is how many training dummies they can defeat within a limited time.\nBased on what Austin saw, Lucy was at least at the second evolution stage, since she was able to chant magic fluently. Then that means, she got the evaluation mainly because of her Shard.\n’Even though this tournament should have been filled with Champions, there are few like me who don’t belong here….’ Asutin chuckled. It wasn’t like he was underestimating himself rather, he was just speaking based on what others might be feeling.\nHe soon reached his room and instantly went to take a bath.\nRead exclusive adventures at .Côm\nHe had already informed Valerie that he would meet her in the Command Tent in an hour. He really needed to take a bath because the sour scent of acid was reeking from his body.\nThrowing away his half-burnt clothes to the bucket, he dove into the water.\n\"Hah~I really love warm baths…\" He sighed and took a few minutes to calm his mind and heart.\nEven though he showed a bold and confident front in front of others, and Valerie, he was actually quite nervous. After all, this was his first battle at such a big stage.\nIt was his luck that he got paired against, maybe, one of the weakest students participating in this tournament. And thanks to that, he didn’t struggle until the end and passed the first round within five minutes.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, host!]\n[You achieved the quest.]\n[Quest points have been added!]\nAustin grinned as he spread his hand like some kind of Emperor and leaned backward.\nHowever, the smirk soon died, as Austin opened his eyes and asked the system in a serious tone, \"Hey, system...can you tell me something?\"\n[What is it, host?]\nAustin’s eyes were focused on nothing in particular as he asked in a daze, \"Even though all my stats are progressing so smoothly and I can feel getting stronger passing each day...why is my Soul Energy still the same as it was as before?\"\nHe couldn’t comprehend why, just like his other stats, his Soul Energy wasn’t progressing.\nUntil now, all Austin could do was to augment his Shard. Using Raijin for a few minutes drains all his energy.\nHe has convinced himself that once he ascends to the next stage of the Overall Progression, his Shard will go through Evolution.\nHowever, his Soul Energy wasn’t improving at all. Today when he saw Lucy releasing so many spells without a second thought, he felt that in a battle of magic, or long-range battle, he would lose almost easily.\nThere was a long pause from the other end, and Austin was waiting patiently.\nFinally, a notification popped up,\n[The host would surely receive a massive boost of Soul Energy once he ascends. However, until then, progressing specific stats is prohibited.]\nAustin scoffed. His system was just making excuses now.\nWhat specific stats? Shouldn’t his magic have upgraded along with Combat? What a bunch of crap.\n’Forget it, I will just go hunting tonight...’\nHeaving a sigh, Austin got out of the bath and wrapped a towel around his waist.\nExiting the bathroom, he was about to move towards his bag, when suddenly, he felt someone approaching him from behind.\nAustin didn’t think twice before summoning his dagger and lunging at the ambusher.\n\"Ah!\" Valerie exclaimed as she suddenly found herself pressed against the wall with slight coldness pressed against her neck.\nAustin raised his brows, finding his fiancée sneaking toward him, as he asked, \"Didn’t you fear that I might harm you?\"\nAlthough he said that, Austin knew that if Valerie wanted she could have easily countered him.\nValerie smilingly said, \"Did I startle you? I wanted to surprise you.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, as he lowered his dagger and said, \"Well, you succeeded. I am surprised, but it will take some time for me to react.\"\nValerie was brought to his bed with her hand being held, as she asked, \"Tired?\"\nAustin slowly shook his head, \"Nah, just all the anxiety and impatience came rushing down at once.\"\nValerie sat close to him, her hand hooked with his and her head leaning on his shoulder, intending to say something when suddenly she realized something when her face planted on his warm skin.\nLooking down...she realized that his upper body was bare.\nHis broad chest rose and fell steadily, each breath making the muscles in his torso shift subtly. His abs were firm, sculpted like they were carved from stone, each ridge catching the light just right. Scars ran across his skin—not imperfections, but marks of battles fought and won, adding a rugged, dangerous charm.\nThere was raw power beneath that skin, restrained yet ready to explode at a moment’s notice. He wasn’t just fit—he was built for battle, for action.\nHeat crept up her neck as she couldn’t stop herself from keeping her eye locked in his god-like body.\nWhy was he so perfect?!\nShe covered her face and began shaking slightly. This is bad. This is so so sooooo bad!\n\"I fink I fould leave...\" With her face still covered, she tried to walk away, only for Austin to hold her waist and pull her back.\n\"Ah!\" Valerie was startled to find herself sitting on her Lord’s lap, with his arm securely locked around her waist and his warmth surrounding her.\n\"Why are you trying to escape, Val? Do you fear that you might end up doing something to me?\" His seductive voice rang in her ears, working as a means to elevate the rate of her already rapidly beating heart.\nA teary-eyed Valerie glanced at her unfair Lord before she muttered, \"D-Do you want t-to?\"\nAustin took a deep breath. Truth be told, this mood was really dangerous for him as well.\nHaving such a stunning fiancée right before him, and then being alone in the room—every sign told him to let go of his restraints and just give in to his desires.\nAnd he knows that Valerie also wouldn’t resist. However,\n\"I...still haven’t gained the permission of your family, Val. And until I don’t do that, I am not officially your partner. So can you wait until then? Please?\"\nHe doesn’t want to rush things when it comes to Valerie. He was eager, yes, but didn’t want to hurt her feelings.\nValerie wasn’t his girlfriend, but his wife. There is no official document about their marriage but he had already considered her.\nThat’s why, he wanted to do everything properly.\nAlso, even though Austin had already turned eighteen, there were still three months left before Valerie would become an adult. So there was that factor as well...\nValerie visibly calmed down after hearing his words.\nShe would be lying to say that she didn’t follow the customs her mother taught her. And she believed that they carried values.\nAlthough she wouldn’t have stopped her Lord if he really wanted to...but after hearing his reason to stop, all she could feel in her heart was inexplicable warmth.\nLowering her gaze, she held his warm hand as she said, \"Every single day, you make me realize that I didn’t fall for the wrong man.\" Turning her head, she kissed him on his cheek, before whispering,\n\"I love you, Austin.\"\nIt was Austin’s turn to turn slightly red, hearing those magical words from the front.\nHe parted his lips and slowly said, \"I-I lo-*chu*\" his eyes widened when his lips were suddenly sealed.\nValerie parted her lips almost instantly, before asking with a tilt of her head, \"I didn’t hear you...what did you say?\"\nAustin was flabbergasted as he absentmindedly said, \"I said, I also lo-\" again! She interrupted him with such a sweet reward again!\n\"I didn’t hear you, at all. Can you repeat it?\" An innocent face which didn’t give the impression that the same girl kept kissing him, asked him.\nAustin narrowed his eyes, \"So you wanna play it like that, huh?\"\nThe room was filled with Valerie’s giggles as Austin suddenly pushed her on the bed, and began kissing her like a madman.\nWithout him knowing, Valerie removed the cloud of glooms with her presence.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- For God’s sake, if I get someone like her, imma gonna fight the world for her!

      "content": "The crowd was loud.\nIf not for the strong material used to make the stands then all the stomping and jumping might have formed cracks in the walls.\nThe reason behind their excitement was the next contestant who was about to battle.\nThe rumors of a strong contender participating from the Valorian Academy have reached the ears of many students across the globe.\nAn S-rank participating in the contest was not a small thing. After all, those S-ranks they have heard about or read about were all working for the Council.\nSo having a warrior who stands at the pinnacle of the rankings, participating in the tournament was, naturally, quite a big event for everyone.\nEvery academy—except for Valorian—watched intently, analyzing the opponent they might face in the future. Her victory today was inevitable, but if they could spot even the slightest weakness in her performance, they might just find a way to bring her down in the team battles ahead.\nAustin was sitting beside Rudolph as he watched the match with great focus.\nHis interest in watching Valerie in action aside, he couldn’t miss watching a battle fought between two high-ranking warriors.\nAfter all, if the strongest one from Valorian was standing on one side, then on the other side was an Elite from the Ravencourt.\n’Best of luck, Val.’ He muttered under his breath as he saw the two participants making their way to the center.\n....\nIn the arena, Valerie silently walked towards the center as she heard numerous voices from her surroundings.\nThere were hundreds of people, however, the person her eyes caught watching her was the most handsome man out there.\n’Watch me closely.’ Unlike that time during the trials, she wasn’t supposed to be holding back here. Here, she was only supposed to win as such, she was going to give a spectacle to her Lord.\nOn the other side, it was a slim dark-blue-haired man who walked towards her\nSlanted eyes and a smirk on his face as he called out, \"I heard you once were invited to study at the Ravencourt, but you rejected?\"\nValerie remained silent; waiting for the referee to come up on the stage\nThe other one continued, \"I, Leo Aketoth, will make you realize what a great opportunity you missed by rejecting the offer. I will show you-\"\n\"Who are you talking to?\" The match referee suddenly appeared before them as he asked. From his perception, Valerie was looking away and seemed completely unaware that the other person was talking.\nLeo scoffed, \"No one.\"\nThe match referee signaled them to take their stance before he relayed the rules to the two.\nValerie finally tore her eyes away from her beloved and looked at her opponent.\nShe doesn’t remember what she learned about her potential opponent, so she decided to just fight like she always does.\nThe referee raised his hand, and asked, \"Participants, ready?\"\nLeo nodded, already having his Shard summoned.\nValerie also nodded, summoning her Shard.\nThe brilliant light that appeared with the spear made everyone gasp.\nIt was the first time for many to see a Shard, which has gone through three evolutions.\nThe bright silver spear was an intimidating yet captivating weapon. Faint engravings ran along its length, whispering of craftsmanship and legacy. The blade, sharp and well-defined, shimmered with a cold brilliance, honed for precise, lethal strikes.\nLeo was ready.\nHe knew exactly who he was facing. There was no holding back—he had to end this in one strike.\nHis fingers tightened around his gauntlet-shaped Shards, muscles coiling like a spring.\nNow or never...\nThe referee’s hand moved.\nTime slowed.\nLeo’s breath steadied, his heart pounded, and his soul energy surged around him like a storm. His eyes locked onto the referee’s hand, tracking every inch as it dropped.\nThe instant it reached the bottom—\n\"BEGIN!\"\nLeo roared, \"Death Fl—\"\nTING!\nThe sharp ring of metal striking stone echoed for a mere second—before the world shattered.\nCRACK!\nThe ground split apart. Ice erupted like a tidal wave, spiraling into jagged spikes that speared toward the sky. A deafening roar of frost filled the arena as the temperature plunged.\nLeo’s eyes barely widened before—\nSNAP!\nHis body was swallowed by the surging ice.\nA massive glacier-like formation rose where he once stood, layers of frost creeping higher, consuming him in an unrelenting grip. His roar of defiance never made it past his lips—his voice was lost inside the crystalline prison.\nThe audience gasped, their breath turning visible in the freezing air.\n\"What… what just happened?\" someone stammered.\n\"He’s… he’s done! He didn’t even move!\"\n\"She ended it in a single strike—\"\nThe chaos from moments ago shattered into silence. Shock and disbelief are written over their faces.\nEvery eye locked onto the massive pillar of ice where Leo had once stood.\nAnd at its base, spear still buried in the ground, stood Valerie—unmoving.\nExpression calm.\nAs if the battle had never even begun.\nEven the referee was caught in the ice, his legs frozen as he looked at Valerie helplessly.\nValerie approached the referee before she used the bottom of her Shard to break the ice.\nTurning towards Leo, who was completely encased in ice, he declared, \"Since the opponent could no longer continue the battle, Valerie wins!\"\nThere was no cheering this time. People were still trying to register what they just witnessed.\nEven the Elites had their eyes widened and minds failing to register what level of sorcery they just saw.\nThe only people who clapped without reservation were from Valorian Academy.\nHowever, Ryan didn’t share the sentiment. His mouth was hung open as he realized what the girl was capable of.\n’If she really wanted...she could have defeated me instantly that day....’\nValerie smiling waved at her teammates before she made her way out of the arena.\n.....\nEvery member of the Elite squad was gathered in the Command Tent to discuss the situation.\n\"Fortunately, we have won all the three matches we have played.\" Annabelle had a wide smile on her face when she announced that.\nOn the first day, Austin was victorious.\nExplore more stories with Free\nOn the second day, Rhea surprised the world with her dual awakening.\nAnd the third day went as everyone expected.\nTomorrow, Rudolph will be playing his match, and it is highly likely that he will win.\nAfter all, not only was he one of the top students in Valorian, but he was also trained by the Commander General and his father.\nSo there was a high chance that the Valorian Academy would get their four semi-finalists tomorrow.\nHowever, it wasn’t like the others were going to stop there.\nEveryone has come here to win; as such, even if Rudolph wins tomorrow, they will do their best to win their matches as well.\nAlthough the pressure has elevated, that’s fine.\n\"Okay then, the meeting is adjourned. Let’s meet tomorrow morning.\" Annabelle declared before everyone slowly began to get up and leave\nValerie and Austin were also heading out together, when Valerie asked, \"Should we go get dinner?\"\nAustin sighed before shaking his head, \"We need to be somewhere else, Val.\"\nThe violette frowned as she tilted her head questioningly.\nSo many things have happened, that Austin wasn’t surprised that she forgot.\nIn a heavy voice, he reminded her, \"We need to meet Madame Selner today at the Union Council’s headquarters.\"\nA sudden rush ran down her spine, the excitement dying with that reminder. However, she didn’t back off and while holding his hand firmly, she said,\n\"Then let’s get going.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Many secrets would unfold maybe. Drop a comment.",

      "content": "Austin would be lying to say that he wasn’t nervous as the carriage advanced toward the headquarters.\nHe has been growing stronger at a very questionable pace. Now, such a drastic change can happen under two circumstances: First, if the person has double awakened like Rhea, which was like one in a thousand years of luck. Second...the person has gotten involved with the other side.\nThe other side in question was, naturally, the demonic side.\nConsuming the dark water, many people have shown tremendous growth in the past. Around a thousand years ago, when demons were reigning supremacy, talented humans were forcibly made to consume Dark Water to change into useful soldiers. And those without talents were treated as slaves and livestock.\nNow that double awakening is something that cannot remain hidden for long, they must be assuming that Austin has gotten himself involved with the demonic side.\nAnd Austin had all the reasons to. After all, his brother has snatched the throne for him—or what they might be thinking.\n’If they put me into an interrogation cell, there is a very high chance they would get to know about my system and, possibly, reincarnation.’ Their interrogation devices are impossible to fool. Considering that the Union Council is the most powerful body of judiciary and executive, Austin cannot appeal anywhere else to protect himself.\nThat’s why, he has decided to reveal himself to be a double-awakened.\nHis second Shard? Raijin, of course.\nHe can summon it on a will and can control it like his Shard.\n....however, it would be troublesome if someone else tried to grab it. Considering a Soul Shard can’t be touched or used by someone else, but Raijin can be, they would instantly know that Austin is lying.\nThat’s why he needs to be careful, or this would be game over.\n\"Nervous?\"\nHearing the voice, which generally calms him down, Austin sighs before nodding, \"Yes, kind of.\"\nValerie smilingly leaned her head on his shoulder, as she muttered, \"It’s the same for me. However, there is something that tells me, that we don’t need to be.\"\nAustin hummed in questioning, \"What do you mean?\"\nValerie shrugged, \"I don’t know but it’s just instincts. As if, I know that this invitation was never meant to harm us.\"\nAustin helplessly smiled, \"I hope your instincts are not playing games with you.\"\nHolding her hand fondly, he leaned back and allowed himself to attain some much-needed rest.\nThe most crucial factor during this meeting with Madame Selner would be calmness.\nOnce he loses his composure, it’s game over.\n....\nThe carriage came to a pause not so long after.\nThe tournament venue was just half an hour away from the city where the Headquarters was situated.\nValerie and Austin stepped out of the carriage, with their hands connected, before they looked at the tall building before them.\nThe last time they came here, they only saw the headquarters from far away.\nHowever, this time, they were going inside.\n\"Did you receive anything from Sebastian, recently?\" Valerie asked. She remembered it was him who went inside the last time and showed no fear when doing so.\nA person worthy to be admired by her Lord.\nAustin hummed, \"He was worried about this meeting, but he couldn’t have traveled from the capital in such a short time, and I didn’t ask him as well.\" Sebastian was currently in the capital, taking care of the King and rearranging things in the Council.\nAfter Aiden’s plans were uncovered, and his room was searched, several things came up.\nThat’s why, the post of Chief Advisor and the Finance Minister were currently empty. And the few who helped Aiden in keeping his crimes a secret are also held captive.\nEryndor was actually in its most vulnerable phase as of now. Any nation going through an internal feud becomes an easy target for others.\nThankfully, currently, Drenovar was in support of Eryndor, and the other major nations had no interest in conquering a small nation such as Eryndor.\nWhile talking about the possible crisis that Eryndor might have to face, Austin and Valerie arrived in the waiting area.\n\"Wait here, I will go inform them,\" Austin said as he left Valerie to sit on the resting bench before he walked towards the reception counter.\nYour next journey awaits at Free\n\"Excuse me,\" he called out before the lady in the reception looked at him, \"I have a meeting with Lady Selner.\" Saying so, he was about to show her the letter, but,\n\"Yes, I will call someone to guide you.\" She didn’t even verify his identity and instantly picked a small round artifact and called someone.\nAustin returned to Valerie and sat down beside her, \"They are sending someone.\"\nValerie nodded, as they sat silently in the waiting area.\nA few minutes passed before someone appeared from the corner, and told them, \"Please come with me.\"\nAustin and Valerie got up and began following the man.\nThey were led through a complicated path. A series of connected galleries, and none of them held any significant signs or decorations to tell them apart.\n\"This...is quite an interesting construction.\"\nThe soldiers smiled, \"This place is built like this to prevent ambush attempts. We are told to learn the pattern from the first day we join. It’s like our daily routine, to revise the routes three times a day, and since we are forbidden to make a map, all we can rely on is our memory.\"\nAustin was surprised. That sounded quite complicated and tough.\n’The soldiers here are built differently...’ He can sense the faint aura releasing from the man. He might be moving ahead of them without having any means to surveil their movements; Austin knew that if he showed slight hostility, the man would counter it most probably.\nValerie, on the other hand, was trying to remember the routes. However, by the seventh gallery, she lost interest and just began following him mindlessly.\nAfter seven or so minutes, they finally came to a halt before the door.\nA large brown wooden door, with a golden door knob.\nJust when Austin and Valerie were about to enter the room, the soldier suddenly bowed before them and said,\n\"I am thankful for what you did in Drenovar. My brother was also among the soldiers; that’s why I feel indebted to you two for saving his life.\"\nAustin and Valerie shared a glance, before the blond one said, \"We are glad that we were there to help.\"\nThe soldier raised his head, and with a smile, he walked away.\nAustin turned toward Valerie before giving her nod and knocking on the door.\n\"Come in,\" Almost instantly, a voice rang from the other side.\nAustin was surprised, but he didn’t delay in twisting the door knob and opening the door.\nAs they entered, the gentle scent of jasmine struck them.\nThe room was quite simple and elegant, with a few showcases on the left and bookshelves on the right.\nA few meters away from the door was the desk where the lady sat.\nShort violet hair, purple eyes, and a youthful face. The lady was sitting with her elbows resting on the table and a thin smile on her red lips.\nValerie froze nearly seeing the beautiful face, as she inwardly muttered,\n’Wasn’t she supposed to be an old granny?’\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Valerie and Austin were told to sit down before someone came to deliver two cups of coffee, both without sugar.\nAustin already knew that the woman looked quite beautiful but from the front, he could tell that there was something about her that wasn't right.\nHer charm didn't cause suspicion but the period she worked for the Council.\nSome say she has been with the Council for a long time and has guided several generations of rulers, throughout the years.\nShe never actually appears in public unless some planetary-level threat shows up. And when, canonically, she does, no one cares about how she looks. After all, between the lady and the demon lord, people naturally chose to focus more on the dangerous side.\nHowever, there was no war going on at this point, so his mind was going back to the same question.\nHow is she still so young?\n\"I am a witch.\"\nThe statement caught both teenagers by surprise.\nWitch?!\n\"Are you joking with us?\" Valerie asked, a frown marring her face.\nThe lady didn't mind being asked rudely as she picked a pen from the desk and said, \"I can control my appearance because time holds no power over me. I will endure as long as this world exists, untouched by the rise and fall of empires. No matter who claims supremacy in the end, I will always find a place of peace—just as I have now.\"\nSaying so, she dropped the pen from her hand—but rather than falling to the ground, the pen slowed down mid-air.\nIt wasn't levitating; rather, it slowed down after falling for inches below the drop point.\nAustin and Valerie both knew that she was using sorcery…but without using her Shard?\nIt took them some time but Austin finally spoke, \"Okay, even if you are a witch, why did you tell us? Weren't we invited here for questioning?\"\nThe reason he believed her so easily was because now that she mentioned it, it all made sense.\nFor someone to use magic so flawlessly without using her Shard…not something a human could achieve. It also explains why, despite appearing so young, she has such a deep influence on the council—something one could only achieve if they have been closely connected to the council for years.\nThe lady sighed before leaning forward, \"Because the basis of every relationship is trust. And I…want to have a relationship with you Austin.\"\n*SHLINK*\nThe table, the coffee mugs, and even the moisture in the air became frozen because of Valerie's magic outburst.\nHowever, the lady before them was completely unbothered.\nIn fact, the frost attack didn't even affect her at all.\nWith her voice lower in temperature than the room, Valerie muttered, \"Please think before you speak, Madame Selner. Maybe you not know-\"\n\"I know. You two are engaged. And trust me, girl, I am not talking about the kind of relationship you are thinking about.\"\nAustin held his lover's hand and, smiling, told her, \"Let's listen to her, okay?\"\nValerie felt embarrassed…was she too impulsive?\nSelner waved her hand and the frost from the room and Austin's clothes disappeared into nothingness.\nAustin had a frown on his face as he tried to discern what exactly she could do.\n'I need to study her a little more…'\nSelner sighed as she advised, \"With that temperament, I wonder how easy it would be for your enemy to destroy you. In my opinion, you should work on it.\"\nValerie huffed…however, it would be a lie to say that those words didn't affect her.\nSelner once again began, \"Austin, can you show me your Shard?\"\nAustin raised his brows. Is this conversation finally heading in the direction where he expected it to have?\nWas he going to get examined?\nRegardless, he didn't think for long, and after getting up, he summoned both of his Shards; ready to give an explanation.\nValerie was already informed what he would be telling them, that's why she wasn't surprised when he summoned his axe as well.\nThe lady got up from her seat and approached him.\nAustin was waiting for her to ask about his dual shard…however, she didn't utter a word until she was close to him and tilted her head as she gazed at his dagger.\n\"Put that away. I know that's not your shard.\" She shoo-ed away the axe just as Austin was preparing to relay the story he had prepared.\nHowever, not only did she ask anything about his other Shard…she even realized that he was lying to her.\nAustin helplessly glanced at Valerie, only to find her helplessly looking back at him.\nWhat…in the world is happening here?\nSelner continued to study his Shard for a long time, meanwhile, Austin wordlessly stored his Shard back in the inventory.\n…wasn't he going to get blamed for being involved with the other side, now?\nHowever, after waiting for several minutes, when she spoke, she didn't accuse him. Rather,\n\"Your soul energy isn't progressing at all, I suppose?\"\nAustin was taken aback, as he slowly nodded, \"Yes…but how do you know?\"\nSelner shrugged, \"I mean your Shard is still at phase zero, so it's pretty natural for your Soul Energy to remain the same. However, your other stats are going up, right?\"\nAustin took a strong gulp, as he said, \"I don't know what you are saying…\" Someone who hasn't gone through evolution to grow stronger…how can this be that possible, right?\nSelner completely ignored her words as she returned to her seat and said, \"Let's form a symbiotic relationship, Austin. We can benefit each other. \"\nSelner suddenly pushed a letter in their direction.\nAustin picked up the letter. It was a rank evaluation appointment…the date was three months from today.\nValerie also read the details and was shocked to see the name of the candidate to be extremely familiar.\nAustin Eryndor.\n\"Ma'am?\" Austin asked.\nSelner explained, \"I have already set your appointment and the next rank you have to get imprinted on your ID card should be A.\"\nValerie's eyes widened, \"What are you…in three months? Even for Austin, it's too much.\"\nProgressing from D to C was one thing, but every rank above C is hard to achieve unless one goes through evolutions.\nSelner's head tilted to the right before telling her, \"Then you might not know your lover enough. Just look at him…do you see disbelief or doubt in his eyes?\"\nValerie was forced to gaze at her lord…and just as the lady said, all Valerie noticed was that he was actually considering reaching rank A in three months.\nValerie was rendered speechless.\nDoes she really not know everything about her Lord?\n-------^^------\nA/N:- I hope you all are enjoying the story so far.\nA request, please drop a review so it helps other people as well.

      "content": "A few things Austin realized after the fifteen minutes of conversation with the chief advisor of the Union Council.\nSomehow, she knows about him more than what his report or any profile could have offered.\nMaybe because she was a witch and could keep an eye on her surroundings. And since she had her eyes on Austin for a long time, she knows so many things about him?\nBut then again, what makes Austin special? Just because his growth rate was unusual?\nAnd then, her unnatural request...no, more like, she was telling him to reach A-rank in three months.\n\"What would you benefit from me leveling up?\" Austin asked, after a brief pause.\nHe has a way to reach A-rank in three months: dungeons.\nHe can grind as hard as he wants, and through dungeons, he would never stop getting stronger. Not to mention, the rewards they bring. And also, the new 'Shop' feature would surely show its helpfulness.\nSelner intertwined her fingers on the table, and while maintaining her calm demeanor, she voiced, \"We are on the verge of a war against the greatest threat humanity could ever come across. The entity who even threatened the deities a thousand years ago. The concept of evil and darkness: the demon lord.\"\nAustin frowned, \"So you want me to become a major fighting unit in the battle against him?\"\nSelner nodded, \"Yes, I do. After all, a person who can grow stronger even without needing his Shard to evolve...I know I won't be able to find such a person even if I try to. So Austin, I want you to not waste your potential and start training to become a useful asset.\"\nAustin felt that her reason was logical but she wasn't telling the truth.\nYes, he can and will become one of the resistance forces against the Demon Lord ...but somehow, he felt that Lady Selner wasn't asking him to level up just because of that.\nWhat could be the reason?\nValerie was silently listening until now, and upon finding the opportunity, she asked, \"If he grows to rank A without his Shard going through advancements, it would cause a massive uproar.\"\nIf her Lord believed he could climb to rank A in three months, then Valerie also believed he could do it. However, the most glaring concern regarding that possibility was the reaction of the public.\nSelner nodded, \"You are right; however, legally, no one would go against you, I promise. After all, the Council would be backing you up.\"\nAustin's brows elevated, \"Will they?\" The Union Council doesn't have the time and interest to support a warrior who is anywhere beneath S-rank.\nSo it was quite difficult to believe in her.\nSelner's lips thinned in a smile, as she said, \"You don't trust them, but you can trust me. Until you are under my watch, they won't question you. And while you are at it, stop forbidding yourself from using your other skills during the battle. I will send a letter to the tournament management, so they won't question you.\"\nAustin sighed, \"So you know about my other skills as well....really, no one knows so deeply about me.\"\nValerie panicked hearing those words as she glanced at her beloved.\nAustin calmed her down by holding her hand fondly and assuring her, \"Only when it comes to my skills. But on an emotional level, you understand me better than I understand myself.\"\nValerie calmed down.\nSelner chuckled, \"It's adorable to see you two getting along.\"\nAustin smiled in the lady's direction. He didn't know how she knew so much about him, but since he couldn't sense animosity from her or any deceit in her words, he chose to not show caution.\nThe room fell under silence for a brief moment before Austin hesitantly asked, \"Madame Selner, since you know so many things about me...can you tell me why my Shard isn't going through evolution or why my Soul energy isn't progressing?\"\nThat was the biggest hurdle for him as of now. Even the system couldn't help him with that. Under such circumstances, he was ready to ask for help from a person he met only half an hour ago\nValerie seemed concerned, seeing Austin in such a low spirit.\nIt would be a lie to say that she wasn't also worried about Shard not going through any evolution, even though, at this point, any awakened should have had their Shard advanced to the next stage.\nSelner remained silent for a few minutes before she declared, \"Okay, let's make it a reward.\"\nAustin hummed in question before the lady added,\n\"I know why your Soul Energy isn't progressing, but I will only tell you if you succeed in the trial I gave you.\"\nWith her eyes holding some mischief, she said, \"Become an A-rank, and I shall tell you why you are stuck at stage zero.\"\nAustin's breath was caught in his throat as Valerie asked hurriedly, \"Do you...really know?\"\nSelner shrugged, \"It's your choice to trust me, but I guarantee you that once he reaches the rank I desire him to be...Austin will get to know his answer.\"\nThe flickering ember of hope, suddenly transformed into raging flames.\nHe was only thinking of how he would level up this fast, but now, he was motivated to do it.\nIf leveling up can help him get rid of the handicap, then he surely would grind until death.\n\"You helped us a lot, Madame Selner.\" Austin thanked the lady.\nNot so long after, they were allowed to leave, but only after being notified that Austin might get summoned anytime in the future as well.\n\"I will also come,\" Valerie coldly stated. Letting her man meet this person alone was not safe.\nSelner just smiled but didn't say anything\nOn that note, the two teenagers made their way out of the room, leaving Selner alone.\nOnce they were gone, Selner heaved a very long sigh.\nPulling open the drawer, she took out a torn red scarf before holding it close to her heart.\n\"It's working...he is on the path to greatness....just as you predicted.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Now start guessing.

      "content": "Rudolph was on the training ground, his body covered with sweat as he remained standing under the dim light provided.\nHe was training in the indoor training facility provided to the students. It was open to everyone, and there was no time limit; that's why Rudolph was taking advantage and practicing using a weapon that was identical to his shard.\nHis team captain has forbidden them from using their Shard during training until they don't face their first rounds. Naturally, Rudolph listened to her words and was using the war hammer provided by the management.\n'This is my only chance…' Rudolph was in his second year and considering this tournament happens once in two years, he wouldn't get another chance.\nVarious things were on the line. His friends' expectations. Rhea's prayers are for every student from Valorian's to get into the second round. And above all, his father's confidence in him.\nHe never doubts Rudolph's skills and has already planned how he would be celebrating the event when Rudolph lifts the trophy.\nWhile these expectations were motivating him….they put him under immense pressure as well.\nThe horror of losing couldn't be greater when the world is expecting you to win.\n\"Fuuh~I can't think of losing here…I need to do my best.\"\nWith those thoughts, Rudolph decided to call it a day.\nHe stored the weapon in the rack before wiping his sweat with his already-drenched shirt.\nThe gymnasium was empty since it was way past midnight. Rhea had told him to sleep after they had lunch together, but it had become his habit recently to train after dinner, so he decided to release some steam to have a good night's sleep.\nStepping out of the hall, he was about to turn when suddenly,\n\"Ah!\" He hurriedly held the hand of the person he crashed into just after turning.\nIt was a beautiful black-haired woman whom Rudolph saw during the welcoming ceremony.\n\"I am sorry,\" Rudolph apologized as he helped the girl stand back on her feet.\nA smile formed on Monica's lips as she lowered her head slightly, \"I should apologize. I was in a rush. Were you training?\" She asked to which Rudolph responded with a nod,\n\"Yeah, what about you?\"\nThe raven-haired looked embarrassed as she said, \"I forgot my hair clip when I came to train…those are lucky ones, so I want them for my match.\"\nRudolph nodded in understanding, and just as he was about to say his goodbye, Monica pointed out, \"Hey, you are bleeding.\" Saying so, she touched his shoulder, and Rudolph felt a stinging sensation from there.\nHe also looked at the spot and indeed, there was a deep cut actively bleeding down his shoulder.\n'Hmm…when did I cut myself?' Rudolph didn't think much about it since he had received several more wounds while training. He covered his wound with his hand and told her,\n\"Just got some while training. Anyway, see you later. Good night.\"\nThe girl nodded before she headed inside the gymnasium.\nRudolph also returned to his room and got some much-needed rest after taking a bath.\nTomorrow is a big day for him.\n------^^------\nAustin and Valerie were slowly heading back to their rooms.\nTheir minds were filled with the thoughts of the meeting they had with the chief advisor.\nFirst, the revelation of her being a witch, followed by the sudden quest she assigned to Austin.\nAustin was still unsure what her goals were, and why she knew so much about him.\nHowever, for now, his focus was on leveling up and getting ranked 'A' in the assessment.\nEven if the lady doesn't answer him, Austin has a feeling that he will break through the first stage of the Overall Progression. So maybe that helps him out.\n…or maybe both his options might fail?\n\"Austin,\" Valerie called out, her head leaning down, as she said, \"…do you think my sudden outburst is a bother?\"\nAustin raised his brows—so she was still bothered about it, huh?\nBack then, Selner warned her that her sudden and controlled reaction might cause her dearly one day.\nHe didn't think for long before relaying his honest thoughts, \"In my opinion, that's cute, Val.\"\nThe girl was shocked as she raised her eyes and looked at him. Her eyes reflected the shine of the moon.\n\"For you to be jealous when someone shows interest in me, I really find it adorable.\"\nWith a side glance, he added, \"However, you have to consider when you can allow your emotions to affect your actions and when you can't. After all, our enemy always searches for our weak points to provoke or weaken us. The moment you show your vulnerable side, it's game over.\"\nValerie's head lowered slightly. She understood the gravity of his words and decided to work on her temperament so that in the future, she wouldn't end up becoming easy prey for her enemies.\n\"I will work on it,\" Valerie slowly muttered.\nAustin hummed, \"Meditation might help. I do it regularly.\"\nValerie chuckled upon hearing that, \"Yes, you told me about it.\"\nBrief silence persisted between them, which was broken by the girl, as she asked, \"Will you be training tomorrow?\"\nConsidering he needs to go through re-evaluation in just three months, every day matters to him. And since Austin doesn't have to participate in any battle for at least a week more, he can train without worries.\nAustin nodded, \"Most likely. Though I would come to watch Rud's match.\"\nValerie nodded, \"He seemed pretty pumped up for his battle.\"\nAustin smiled, \"I mean this is his opportunity to show what he trained for.\"\nTomorrow, Valorian will get their fourth qualified member.\nOr so they thought.\n…..\n\"Monica wins!\"\nEveryone from the Valorian academy had their mouths parted slightly as they gazed at the fallen Rudolph.\nNone of them could have ever expected that one of the strongest students from Valorian Academy would be defeated so easily.\nThe students were booing and badmouthing Rudolph for his performance.\nIn the arena, Monica coldly looked at Rudolph as she muttered under her breath, \"Sorry big guy, but I can't let anyone come between us.\"\nAnd with that, Valorian Academy lost their first match and their first player.\n--------^^---------\nA/N:- B*tch alert.

      "content": "[A few minutes earlier]\nAustin, along with the other team members, were gathered in the stands to watch Rudolph's match.\nThe audience was vast today as well. The students who were not participating from each academy were allowed to spectate.\nNaturally, the council arranged their stay near the venue—which was a big thing, considering over a thousand students were visiting the tournament.\nIf not for every kingdom providing funds and the management getting help from the Union Council, then arranging the tournament at this scale would have been quite difficult—no, impossible.\nAustin turned his attention toward the match referees around the arena. To stop any student from damaging their opponent beyond recovery, they would jump immediately.\n'One of them must be a barrier specialist and one must be a medic.' Austin guessed.\n\"Want some candies?\" Rhea suddenly offered him.\nAustin turned his eyes, before nodding. However, when he raised his hand to pick some candies, he noticed something,\n\"You are shaking, Rhea,\" Austin called out, as he took some candies.\nRhea looked down at her hand and blinked in confusion.\nThe President of the Student Council, who was sitting on the other side of the pink head, asked, \"Why are you nervous? Weren't you the most confident one about this match?\"\nValerie also noticed the small hubbub as she picked some candies from Austin's hand and asked him, \"What's the matter?\"\nAustin shrugged, as they both heard from the pink head,\n\"I don't know why, but I feel like something bad is about to happen. I really wish not to, but I don't know.\"\nAustin narrowed his eyes in suspicion. Anyone saying such words could be ignored, but the Protagonist with the blessing of majorly every God?\n'No, no…there must be something wrong then…' Even though Austin was contemplating what might have gone wrong, it was too late.\nThe two participants were already in the middle of the arena.\nOn the left side was the black-haired girl whom Austin met during the welcoming ceremony and still couldn't forget about. And on the right was his friend and the fourth member participating from the Valorian.\nAll Austin could do now was to hope that Rudolph would get through this hurdle.\n…..\nIn the arena, Rudolph and Monica stood facing each other.\nThe noise of the crowd was majorly focused on the girl and her beauty.\n\"We meet again,\" The girl said with a friendly smile, \"I hope you had a good sleep.\"\nRudolph nodded, \"You bet.\" His body has recovered enough for him to not make any mistakes during the battle.\n…however, there was a strange feeling inside his head that was making him hesitant for some reason. He didn't know why but his mind was refraining him from beginning this battle.\n'What am I even thinking…' reprimanding himself, Rudolph got prepared.\nThe match referee appeared on the stage and first informed them of the rules.\nOnce done, Rudolph summoned his Shard, which was in the form of a huge battle hammer that pulsated with raw energy.\nThe haft is a massive, darkened metal shaft reinforced with bands of enchanted silver, long enough to require both hands to wield properly. The pommel is capped with a jagged crystal, cracked but ever-glowing, signifying the raw power it contains.\nRudolph has named it: Titan Judgement.\nOn the other hand, the Shard that Monica manifested was a single-hand war fan. It was violet in color and had enough details to signify the evolutions it had gone through.\nRudolph doesn't know anything about Monica. The lessons Rhea taught him about his potential opponents were all forgotten. Rudolph always had the philosophy that in a real battlefield, no one knows whom they might need to face, so in the tournament as well, the element of surprise can help them prepare.\n\"Participants, ready?\"\nRudolph picked up his weapon and gave a firm nod.\nMonica did the same, covering her mouth with the war fan, she gave a nod.\nThe referee slashed his hand,\n\"BEGIN!\"\nJust as the referee commenced, Rudolph's figure turned a blur—which was a surprise considering his size—as he appeared behind her back.\nMonica was in no position to counter his attack as Rudolph raised his battle hammer, ready to deliver a blow to knock her out.\nThe students held their breath seeing the big lion standing behind the small rabbit with his fangs bared.\nHowever, right before he could attack the girl, his…hand slipped and he failed to land the blow.\n\"Huh?\" Rudolph exclaimed as his hammer landed on the ground rather than on the girl's shoulder.\nMonica took the opportunity to find the boy at her face level before she waved her war fan, and a streak of blood sprayed from Rudolph's collar.\n\"Agh!\" Rudolph groaned in pain as he left his hammer on the ground and reeled his punch to strike—only to stop inches away from her face.\n\"Huh…\" Rudolph didn't know why but he didn't bring himself to hit the girl at all. It wasn't his principles; rather, his mind was playing games at the worst time.\n*SQUELCH*\nA stream of blood flowed down his face as a deep gash was inflicted by the girl.\n\"No…\" In the stands, Rhea had tears in her eyes as she approached the handrail.\nEveryone from the Elite division was shocked, including Esner(Parkinson). He has fought with Rudolph in the past so he knows what the boy is capable of.\n'What in the world happened to you?' Esner muttered under his breath with a frown on his face.\nAustin had a bad feeling after witnessing this unexpected turn of events.\nAlthough people in the audience were saying that Rudolph was not immune to Monica's charm and couldn't bring himself to hit the beauty, Austin knew that it wasn't the case.\nRudolph is the guy who has hit even the love of his life without hesitation in the past. So, it was quite unnatural for him to show hesitation during the battle.\n'What happened to you…'\nBack in the arena, the paralyzing effect of Monica's weapon took effect and Rudolph fell to the ground.\nThe referee came to check on the boy, asking him if he could continue, but Rudolph's body was failing to respond to his plea and his mind was in chaos of what he had done.\nIn the end, the referee declared Rudolph unfit to continue the battle. Resulting in,\n\"Participant Monica wins!\"\nThe said girl smiled in elation, before she directed her eyes toward a certain blond in the stands, and muttered under her breath,\n\"No one can come between us~\"\n---------^^---------\nA/N:- I think you guys can guess what Monica's shard's ability is. Well, we will get there eventually. Leave a comment.",

      "content": "\"UGHOOO!\"\nThe giant roared as a lightning axe buried itself deep into its chest, followed by a dagger that plunged straight into its skull. It barely had time to react before its massive body collapsed, lifeless.\nAustin didn't stop. With a sharp command, Wisp unleashed judgment upon the next monster, followed by a blinding bolt of lightning struck from the sky, frying the creature as it lunged forward. The giant's charred body stiffened, then crashed to the ground, unmoving.\nTHWANG!\nA loud impact rang out as another monster tried to ambush Austin from behind. But his barrier flared to life, sending the giant's wooden club flying. Austin spun around, eyes locking onto his attacker. Without hesitation, he reeled back his fist—\nBOOOOM!\nHis punch tore straight through the monster's stomach, leaving a gaping hole. The creature gasped before crumpling to the ground.\nAustin exhaled, summoning his Shard back to his hand. With a thought, he reshaped it into a long spear. Another monster charged from afar, too slow to reach him in time. He smirked, then used a nearby kneeling giant as a springboard, launching himself into the air.\nWith all his strength, he hurled the spear—\nBOOOOM!\nThe impact shattered the monster's skull in a violent explosion.\nAustin landed smoothly, his breath steady despite the relentless battle. He glanced around, surveying the battlefield.\nFifty giants. All dead.\nAnd he wasn't done yet.\nThese giants were of rank 'C' at best, which explains why they were easy to defeat and why they provided so few points.\nAustin glanced in the direction of the next section of the dungeon.\nThe monsters there looked stronger and taller and the points they offered were more as well.\nThat means the system tracked his ranking and has elevated the difficulty, huh?\n'System, you said it was a B rank dungeon…then…'\n[The system is only helping the host to elevate his stats rather than having mundane battles.]\nAustin's brows twitched. Why is it that, he wasn't allowed to farm some EXP in peace? Does he need to struggle for every single point?\n'Not fair…'\nWith those thoughts, Austin decided to leave.\nHe was slightly disturbed about the match he watched today.\nRudolph's strange behavior was unsettling, and coincidentally, his opponent was the one person who constantly troubled Austin's mind.\n'Until I don't ask him, I won't know what exactly happened back then…' Austin decided to meet Rudolph tomorrow as he returned to his room and decided to have a bath first.\nSheldon was not in his room, even though it was way over dinner time.\nAustin and Valerie also decided to call it a day early since Austin told her that he would go train.\nValerie had to attend the meeting with the President so they went their respective ways.\nDipping inside the warm water, Austin called out, 'Show me my stats, system.'\n[Combat: 63->72/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[Romance: 63/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[You have gained a reward!]\n[Durability: 68->73/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[Trickery: 31/100]\nNext reward at 35}\n[Overall Progression: 53.5->59/100]\n[Next Reward at 70]\n…\nAustin hummed, studying his current stats.\nHe was still far from crossing the first stage. However, considering he was, at best, a 'B-' rank now, he knew by the time he reached A, his overall progression would hit a hundred as well.\nHis current points were:\n[Total points: 429]\nSeeing the points and the possible points he could earn in the second dungeon, Austin asked, \"How many points do I need to unlock the next dungeon?\"\n[A thousand, host.]\nAustin hummed. Pretty reasonable.\nAt this rate, he can earn points for the next stage if he enters the dungeon once more.\nAnd then, those points he further earns would be used on Shop.\nWhat Austin needs to do right now is to farm points as many as he can within this week since next week would be the squad matches, and for that, he would be required to train as a team.\nAfter that would come the duo matches…however, more than the matches, what troubled Austin was the Beast King Zevarath—the same demon general who attacked Drenovar and against whom Valerie fought.\nCanonically, by now, Zevarath should have started recruiting students who lost their first round or those who were feeling bitter about not having the opportunity to participate.\nDemons like Kalwar were filled in Zevarath's army, who could change their appearance and mask their demonic presence, so Austin couldn't trust anyone other than those whom he knew closely…or more like, just one person.\n'Assumably, if they haven't entered the tournament then what could be their plan?' Austin doesn't have any idea, and the only person who can get any lead about it is the protagonist.\nThat's why Austin was going to observe Rhea—naturally, only to the point where his lover doesn't get jealous—and see if he could get some clues about what the Demon General is planning.\nAttacking a venue near the Union Council headquarters would be quite a bold move, but considering they could take innocent students as their hostages, Austin knew he couldn't rely on the authorities for his own and Valerie's security.\n'Need to keep my eyes and ears open all the time.'\n…\nAfter having a bath which continued longer than usual, Austin exited the bathroom and found Sheldon removing his tie.\nHe seemed tired as he didn't even notice Austin until he called out, \"Hey, everything good?\"\nThe silver head turned toward the blond Prince, before he nodded, \"Yeah, more or less.\"\nAustin knew that the boy was tired, but since he was curious about something, he didn't hold himself from asking, \"What did you discuss during the meeting?'\nOnly Valerie and Sheldon were called by the President that's why Austin wanted to know what decisions were taken.\nHe surely would have heard about it from Valerie tomorrow, but he couldn't wait for that long.\nSheldon exhaled a sigh before informing him, \"In the squad matches, there usually arrives a need for someone who can do the duty of guarding and defending. Rudolph was our best choice…and now him gone, we need to think of our other options.\"\nThey were confident that he would pass the first round that's why they didn't think of a second option…until now, that is.\nThings have changed and the best option they have now is, \"Either you or me. But I tell you, I am not good at guarding places.\"\nAustin frowned, \"What about Valerie. What's her position in the team?\"\nSheldon raised his brows, \"You don't know?\"\nAustin wryly smiled, \"I never participated in raids with her and our conversation never led that way…well, forget about that and tell me.\"\n\"She is on the tactician. She supports both defense and offense.\"\nAustin hummed. She has the ability to do both.\n\"What about the President, Elara, and Ryan?\"\nSheldon bluntly said, \"I am not too hopeful for the latter two.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"Ryan was challenging even for Valerie, you know?\"\n\"But do you think she would have struggled if she had gone all out from the get-go?\"\nAustin realized his mistake. They weren't here to show their strength but to dominate their opponent.\nSo there was a high chance that Ryan might never get the chance to use the ability of his Shard.\nAs for Elara...then she might be the weakest Elite from the Valorian, even though everyone considered Austin to be the weakest.\nSheldon got up, preparing to take a bath, as he said, \"If things come between us, know that you would be participating.\"\nAustin was taken aback as he saw the guy nonchalantly declaring his potential drop out from this tournament.\nSeeing him casually entering the bathroom, Austin could only shake his head,\n'I really can't understand this guy...'\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Today was the fifth day of the tournament, and Elara was the person participating from the Valorian.\nNaturally, the academy members couldn't remain stuck on the person who lost his battle yesterday.\nHowever, Rhea couldn't get over it that easily.\nShe barely slept last night and if not for the rules prohibiting anyone from staying in the infirmary overnight unless they are injured, Rhea couldn't be with Rudolph last night.\nHowever, early morning of the next day she came to the medical wing while carrying so cupcakes for Rudolph.\nHowever, the moment she appeared before him, \"Please leave me alone for the time being.\"\nHer hand, which was inside the basket and was about to take out the cupcake, froze in place.\nRudolph was covering his eyes with his forearm as he added, \"I don't want to talk right now.\"\nRhea opened her mouth to say something…so assure him that everything was fine and he would bounce back one day. However, nothing but a choked sob left her throat.\nIn the end, all she said was, \"Sorry for disturbing you…\" With that, she turned around and walked away.\nRudolph clenched his fist and bit his lip. He couldn't explain how he was feeling right now. Both because of the match and how he treated Rhea.\nHowever, despite not wanting to hurt the love of his life, Rudolph couldn't bring himself to look at her right now.\n…\n\"Ah!\" Outside the infirmary, just as Rhea dashed out, she crashed into someone who was heading inside.\nThe other person held Rhea's arm to prevent her from falling, as he asked, \"Are you okay?\"\nRhea looked at him…he was the same person whom she met on the first day of the tournament.\n\"We meet again, Miss Rhea.\" He said with a friendly smile.\nRhea, although not wanting to talk at the moment, exchanged greetings politely, \"Hello, Esner.\"\n----------^^---------\n\"Here, it is for you.\" Early in the morning, as they walked in the back garden after breakfast, Austin suddenly presented her with a gift.\n\"Hmm?\" Valerie's brows elevated as she saw the ring in his hand and a nearly identical one, he was wearing as well.\nAustin explained to her, \"Just like the ring we bought back in the market(when they went on a date), this ring is just a better version of it. It can help us locate each other's presence when we are in distress or any grave situation.\"\nAustin gained the reward from the system last night upon his 'Romance' stats progression.\nValerie had a few questions about how he found the artifact of such a high grade, but right now, all she did was offer her hand to him—not to take the ring from him.\nAustin blinked before he looked up at her.\nThe tinge of redness on her cheeks signified what she wanted.\nAustin smiled fondly at the girl before taking her hand and inserting the ring on her fourth finger.\nOnce he did, he leaned forward and kissed the back of her hand, \"It looks lovely on you.\"\nOnce he got up, Austin was startled to see tears in her eyes.\n\"Val?\" He asked as he brought her closer and cupped her cheeks.\nValerie shook her head, \"It's…nothing.\"\n\"No, please tell me.\" He insisted. He knew that it wasn't the tears of elation but sadness.\nValerie didn't resist him from wiping her tears as she honestly told him the reason for her sudden outburst, \"Actually, I was reminded of the day when we exchanged rings during our engagement ceremony. You…didn't care about the fact that the ring was of smaller size and just inserted it somehow.\"\nValerie didn't want to say it, but she ended up confessing, \"That….showed how annoyed you were of the engagement and me…and that….really hurt me.\"\nAustin embraced his lover close to him, encircling his hand around her back.\nHis heart trembled upon hearing her words.\nHe also remembers the day. He remembers every detail.\nHe really was angry with everyone around him at that time and he only thought Valerie was pitying him by getting engaged to him.\nHe was so blinded by hatred that he never noticed how genuinely happy she was that day. The same girl who barely showed her emotions in front of others was smiling all the time when she arrived at the royal palace that day…only for her smile to disappear when Austin showed his clear reluctance to their relationship.\nAustin couldn't relay how regretful he was of his action and how much he wanted to go back in the past to redo everything.\nRather than crying like this, Austin wanted her to smile while thinking about those moments.\n\"Val…I really can't say sorry and expect you to forget about it. However, I can promise you something for certain… not even once you will experience something like that again. I swear on my life.\"\nHis old self has left several wounds on this girl. All she ever wanted was to get some love and attention, and in exchange, she was ready to give everything to him: her love, her life, her devotion…everything.\nAlthough Austin could never rewrite the past, he vowed that from now on, every moment would be a gentle touch upon her heart—no more wounds, only things that could heal her and fill her future with beautiful memories.\nIt took some time but Valerie calmed down as she looked up at him.\nAustin gazed at her red eyes and innocent expression. There was slight guilt in her eyes that made him sigh,\n\"Thanks for letting me know what was hurting you. Just as I told you before, I am not just your partner in happiness. I want to know and experience all your grief as well. So just like today, never hold back from telling me if something is troubling you, okay?\"\nValerie shyly nodded, \"Oka-\"\n\"Really, it's such a hassle.\" She was interrupted as she and Austin heard several people advancing in their direction.\nThey were in the back garden where generally no one wanders—considering most of the students were focused on either matches or training.\nAnd the surprising part was that the people who passed by were council staff.\nSeeing a bunch of them moving about, Austin stepped away from Valerie and approached one of them before asking, \"Excuse me, sir, what happened?\"\nThe staff member turned toward him, before telling him, \"You should be in your rooms right now. We informed every student to not roam around.\"\nValerie added, \"We have been out of our rooms since dawn so we never received any message. What happened?\" It was surprising to see her switching her mood so instantly, but thanks to her cold tone, the staff member didn't ask anything further and informed them,\n\"One of the management chiefs cannot be located. He has been missing for two days.\"\nAustin's brows knitted close as he muttered under his breath,\n'Are the Demons already here?'\n-------^-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Drop a comment.",

      "content": "The following three days were eventful.\nAustin kept visiting the dungeon and slowly, he cleared the mobs of the second dungeon. And now, only the final boss was left. But right now, Austin wasn't prepared to face the creature.\nA thirty-foot-tall Orc Lord. Nah, not something he can win against as of now. For that, he needed some points so he could purchase a specific weapon for the Shop, which would help him win against the monster.\n[Name: Ashen Maul]\n[Rank: B]\n[Points: 1200]\n...\nHe currently has around fifteen hundred points, so he was thinking of using those points to purchase the weapon and some potions.\nThe final Boss would grant him two thousand points, so there was no problem. He would be able to unlock the next dungeon easily.\nHe was having a good time in the dungeon these days. He has gotten a good handle on his three weapons, and he has used some points to decrease the cooldown time for a few skills which he often uses.\nNow, coming back to the tournament, as Sheldon predicted, Elara and Ryan lost their round. Surprisingly, Ryan lost more brutally than Elara. The boy was never given the chance to launch an attack.\nWell, that was to be expected since he was facing the Captain of the Ravencourt Academy.\nAbout the President, then she seamlessly won her match. Although not like Valerie, she did overwhelm her opponent with her grace and her Shard.\nNow, all the matches have concluded, and every academy has gotten their semi-finalist.\nAustin had a copy of the roster, which stated,\n1. Ravencourt— 600pts\n2. Auroracrest—500pts\n3. Runebridge—Drenovar—500pts\n4. Avalon—Hener—400pts\n5. Ironvale—300pts\n6. Stellthorne—100pts\n7. Valorian—500\n8. Grimhold—hybrid nations—300pts\n...\nValorian Academy has brought some of the remarkable students this year since having five out of eight students win their individual matches was no small feat.\nEverywhere, they were whispering about how the presence of an S-rank had brought this change or whatnot. They believed that Valerie was training them or something along those lines, that resulted in such favorable results.\nNaturally, no one tried to clear the misunderstanding since it was utterly pointless.\nNow, the group of five was gathered in the Command Tent to discuss their matches.\n\"Did you not call them?\" Austin asked the President with his brows elevated\nThe President exhaled a sigh, \"I...called them, but...\"\nAlthough they lost their matches, Anabelle believed that they held experience that could have helped them form a strategy.\nHowever, they didn't come—or so what did they think,\n\"I am late, sorry.\"\nEvery eye turned toward the person who entered the tent with hurried steps and took his seat beside Sheldon.\nAnnabelle smiled at him, \"Thanks for coming.\"\nRyan nodded. Sure he was bitter about his match, but not like he would sulk like a loser in his room when he could help his team win.\nRhea released an audible breath as she said, \"It's highly unlikely Rudolph would come. I tried calling him...but.\" although Rudolph was no longer ignoring her, he still was quite disturbed about what happened.\nAnd he clearly told Rhea that he wouldn't be joining the meeting.\n\"Elara seemed grumpy...well, she always remains like that, so there is no point in waiting for her.\" The pink head further added.\nAnnabelle nodded before she finally went towards the whiteboard and wrote something.\nEveryone looked at the board and read,\n[Current points: 500]\n[Next match: 500]\n[Duo matches: 200 each]\nTurning toward them, she said, \"While assuming that we would win the second round, and assumably won't face Ravencourt, then we would get the option to defeat them in the duo matches.\"\nUnlike Valorian or any other school, Ravencourt could put three duos during the third stage, if only they win the next round as a squad.\nNo, even if they lose the next match, they would get a duo to participate in the third round.\n\"Did they send the match details?\" Ryan asked.\nThis year, things are being kept quite secretively for some reasons. That's why, it was getting tough to prepare.\nAnnabelle shook her head, \"Nope. That's why we are going to assume that the match would be of the same concept—hunt and defend.\"\nThey have been following the same contest style for many years, and just because they changed the pattern doesn't mean they would create a new type of contest from scratch.\nAustin added here, \"You mean to say, one to defend, one to support, and two who raid?\" Although he never participated in any kind of squad exercises, he knew these details.\nAnnabelle nodded, \"That's right,\" Saying so, she wrote the aforementioned roles on the board.\n\"I have seen Rhea fighting, and I can tell that she would be a great raider with her dual Shard, which allows her both close-quarter and long-range battles. So along with me, she could be an ambusher.\"\nAnnabelle's decision to put herself as the ambusher wasn't questioned since everyone was aware of her abilities. And even if someone might have any doubts in their mind, her recent match proved that she is the perfect choice for their team's forerunner.\nComing to the tactician post, she just wrote Valerie's name, and no one even bothered to ask for any explanation.\nAustin smiled as he glanced at his lover and found her looking back at him with slight smugness as if to say, 'Praise me'.\nAustin decided to pet the girl a lot when they would be alone.\nAnabelle wrote the last role and tapped the marker pen thrice under the name to show her contemplation.\nTurning towards others, she was about to say something when suddenly Sheldon voiced, \"I forfeit. I know I won't be able to perform well as the defender. I took part as a tactician but since there is only one team performing, I should just rest and see you guys win.\"\nSheldon was good as a supporter with his skills. But defending solely would be quite difficult for him.\nThat statement from him made Ryan frown as he said, \"Nothing against Austin, but shouldn't you think a little before making such s decision, Ryan? I mean, we are talking about our chances to remain alive in this tournament, so you shouldn't just pull away like that.\"\nRyan wasn't against Austin participating in the tournament. He just wanted the best player to be in the team, and if Sheldon could be that, then he should have some confidence in himself and take part in the second round.\nValerie also didn't say anything since her interjection here would have hurt her Lord's pride. She wanted him to enter into the second round with his abilities.\nAnnabelle hummed in response, \"He is right, Shelly-Sheldon.\" She corrected herself just in time, before hurriedly adding, \"We need to discern who could be the best option as our defender.\"\nSheldon sighed, \"And how can we ascertain that?\"\n\"Simple. Through a battle.\" Rhea muttered, and before anyone could tell her that the situation was different, she added, \"We can modify the battle in a way that could test their defending skills.\"\nAnabelle nodded, \"That's a good idea...and I know just the best way to test them.\" Slamming her hand on the table, she said, \"Okay then, let's meet in the training hall, in two hours.\"\nBy that time, most of the students would have returned to their rooms, so they would get enough room for the examination.\nNo one showed reluctance. As such, the meeting was adjourned.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Well, I hope you don't mind the time skip, since I didn't want to bore people with the grind.\nDrop a comment.",

      "content": "While others went to prepare for the examination between Sheldon and Austin, the blond prince was currently heading toward the infirmary to meet his friend.\n\"Listen, whatever happens, don't mention anything about the match to Rudolph. He has barely gotten over that day, so please don't remind him of it, okay?\" Those words were spoken by Rhea when she heard that Austin was going to visit Rudolph.\nAustin agreed to her. It must be a nightmare for Rudolph to lose at this stage. Austin knows how much he was training for this tournament. While Austin refrained from participating in group raids, knowing he would have slowed down any group, Rudolph never shied away from life threatening dangers and constantly led his team to victory.\nHe was one of the academy's top students, the one everyone placed their bets on. After Valerie, Rudolph had the highest win percentage, making him the most promising contender.\nHeaving a sigh, Austin entered the infirmary, and instantly a frown contoured his face as he noticed a certain person standing before Rudolph's bed.\n\"Oh, hey, Austin.\"\nIt was Monica.\nAustin didn't say anything and gave a nod to the girl before turning toward his friend, \"How are you now?\"\nRudolph's bandages have been undone and overall, the boy seemed fine. And as he thought,\n\"I am good. They are discharging me today.\" Rudolph was seriously exasperated because of their persistent behavior. Even though he said that he was fine, they insisted on keeping him.\nMonica took the hint that the two wanted to have some alone time so she bid her farewell, \"Okay then, Rudolph, see you later.\" With that, she made her way out of the casualty care.\nOnce she was out, Austin asked, \"Why was she here?\" Austin could regard it as nothing else than rubbing salt on one's wound when one's enemy—who has defeated you—comes to see you in the infirmary.\nRudolph shook his head, as if to dispel his concerns, as he said, \"She came to meet her teammate in the infirmary, and when she saw me she just stopped by to ask about my health.\"\nAustin hummed as he picked the clipboard from the head of the bed before asking, \"What did the doctor say about your condition?\"\nRudolph heaved a sigh, \"Toxin in my blood. Those suckers were having a hard time removing something our school medics would have taken out within hours.\"\nAustin nodded slowly as he read the report.\nHis eyes grew darker as he read how deeply the toxin had spread which made him slightly suspicious.\n'He was brought to the medic right after the match, so why did the venom spread so deeply?'\nRemoving his eyes from the file, Austin asked, \"Man up and tell me something,\"\nRudolph raised his brows in surprise as he heard his friend asking, \"Did you meet someone before your match? Like anyone whom you don't know or don't trust?\"\nRudolph sighed and was about to say that it doesn't matter anymore, only for Austin to interject, \"Just shut up and think. This is important.\"\nBeing reprimanded, the big guy was forced to think about whom he met before the match.\nIn the morning, he only met Rhea, whom he trusted blindly, and didn't come across any unknown face.\n'As long as I remember…wait!' His eyes suddenly stretched as he said, \"Actually, I met Monica a day before the match.\"\nAustin grimly asked, \"And did she hit you or touched you anywhere?\"\nRudolph didn't take time to respond, \"Yeah, she pointed out a wound on my shoulder by touching it.\"\n\"Knew it!\" Austin growled.\nHe knew something was wrong with this whole farce. Rudolph hesitating to hit a girl just because she is beautiful? Yeah, nothing could be more unbelievable than that.\nRudolph also felt a sense of suspicion in his heart, but, \"But she couldn't have anticipated whom she would be facing a day before, right? After all, we don't get to know about our opponent until we step on the stage.\"\nAustin nodded, \"Yes, that's true, which can only mean two things; first, she went and targeted all the seven potential candidates who were participating on the same day as her.\" It was not difficult to know who the seven members were. The Council releases the list for everyone so they can prepare for their potential opponent. It's just that Monica seemed to have taken 'preparation' to a whole different level.\nRudolph groaned; he actually never paid attention to the list or he would have been a little more cautious toward his potential opponent.\nAustin added the second possibility, only after he drew nearer to Rudolph and ensured that no one was eavesdropping, \"Maybe she got to know about her opponent from one of the officials and came to target you right away.\"\nRudolph's expression was forbidding as he muttered, \"It felt like a crime hitting her…almost like I would be committing the hideous crime if she got hurt.\" Looking up, Rudolph added, \"You know me, Austin, I am not like that. I don't show partiality between men and women, especially not on this stage.\"\nWith his fists clenched, he spoke in a heavy tone, \"The only reason I never talked about it was because I knew anyone would have thought that I was just making excuses. But only I know what I felt when I was in the arena. I wasn't in control.\"\nAustin patted his friend on his shoulder, \"I understand you, bud. And trust me, Rhea also doesn't believe in what others are assuming.\"\nRudolph smiled, the cloud of anger and depression vanishing as he said, \"I know. Thanks for trusting me.\"\nRudolph and Austin both knew that there was no point in continuing the conversation about Monica since they had no evidence. If only Rudolph had been tested by better doctors, they would have known that the toxin was injected way before the match. Blaming the authorities was like bashing your head against a wall. Totally pointless, and potentially self-harming.\n\"Anyway, are you going to have dinner?\" Rudolph asked. Since he was out of the tournament, he would empty the buffet tonight before heading back to his room.\nAustin shook his head, \"Nope, I got a trial to pass.\" Seeing Rudolph's brows elevating in question, Austin added, \"Examination to prove that I am a trustworthy defender for the team.\"\nRudolph grinned, \"That's so, then I will come too.\"\n--------^^-------\nEveryone had already gathered in the indoor gymnasium when Austin and Rudolph arrived.\nA smile bloomed on Rhea's face, seeing the big guy beside Austin.\nShe skipped her way toward them before saying, \"Congrats on your discharge.\"\nRudolph gave a short nod before asking her, \"Did you have dinner? I brought something for you.\"\nRhea's smile only extended seeing him in his usual mood as she smilingly accepted the muffin.\nAustin also approached his beloved and handed her some orange juice and a sandwich.\n\"Thank you…I needed this.\" Valerie sweetly smiled at him as she bit into the sandwich.\nSoon Annabelle and the other two arrived near them and said, \"So, shall we begin?\"\n--------^^-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "To determine the best candidate for the team's defender, a specialized training exercise was set up.\nThe defender would stand before a humanoid-shaped training dummy, firmly attached to a vertical pole. This dummy had a unique feature—it would change color based on the force and number of hits it received, turning a deeper shade of red with each impact.\nFour raiders—Annabelle, Rhea, Ryan, and Rudolph (who volunteered)—would take turns attacking the target using different techniques. A raider could strike multiple times, testing the defender's ability to withstand continuous assault.\nThe challenge had a strict two-minute time limit—just enough time to simulate how long a defender needed to hold out until the team's tactician arrived. Once the trial ended, the dummy's final color would reveal the outcome: the defender whose dummy showed the most damage would be benched.\nValerie wasn't taking part in this exercise since she didn't need to. Currently, the girl and her lover were standing at one side, and seeing Sheldon getting prepared for the round.\nHe was wearing armor identical to what they would be wearing during the second stage.\nRudolph and the other three and taken different positions—Ryan was not even visible and seemed to have prepared a surprised attack.\n\"Nervous?\" Valerie asked in a hushed tone as they stood with their shoulders touching.\nThe blond one shook his head slightly, \"Not as much as I was during the first round…maybe because I am now allowed to use all the cards I possess?\"\nHearing those words, her expression turned solemn a little as she asked, \"Austin…do you trust that woman?\" For him to show such comfort in showing his other skills, meant that he trusted her words about sending a notice to the Council.\n\"Not really, however, it is a fact that without using my other abilities and Raijin, I won't be able to give my best during the tournament.\"\nSince those secrets wouldn't remain hidden for long, and Austin knew that while holding back he wouldn't be able to help his team, why not use the stage of the Tournament to announce that he has skills other than his Shard?\nValerie had a troubled look and Austin could understand what she must be feeling.\nThis world was cruel, and the council heads were freaks who could go beyond normal means to possess something they deemed as an asset for the upcoming war.\nThat's why, Austin needs to be prepared for any kind of backlash.\n\"Begin!\"\nThe air tensed as Annabelle's voice echoed across the arena.\nRhea exploded forward, covering the distance between her and Sheldon in three powerful leaps. Her pink hair trailed behind her, and her sword gleamed under the light.\nSheldon's silver eyes remained sharp, his curved dagger held in a tight reverse grip. As Rhea feinted left, trying to slip past his guard, Ryan's leg suddenly shot out.\n\"Ahhh!\"\nRhea gasped as her balance was stolen from her, stumbling forward. But before she could crash into the training doll, a strong hand caught her collar.\n\"Not so clever, girl.\"\nSheldon smirked before yanking her back and tossing her onto the floor.\nRhea clicked her tongue and rolled away, pushing herself up just as Sheldon leaped back—\nBOOOOOOM!\nThe entire training hall shook as Rudolph's massive frame slammed down where Sheldon had just been standing. Dust and debris shot into the air.\n\"Shit!\"\nSheldon cursed. He had dodged on instinct, but now Rudolph's battle hammer was raised—aiming straight for the training doll.\nWith a sharp flick of his wrist, Sheldon's dagger traced a crescent arc. Instantly, a clone materialized in front of him and dashed toward the target without hesitation.\n\"HUPP!\"\nRudolph roared as he swung his colossal weapon down. The sheer force sent a gust of wind rippling outward.\nAt the last moment, Sheldon's clone threw itself between the hammer and the training doll.\nCRAAAAACK!\nThe clone shattered into nothingness, absorbing the full force of the attack. But the doll? Untouched.\n\"Tch.\" Rudolph scowled as his weapon rebounded, unable to even scratch the target.\nRyan wasted no time. He was already behind the big guy.\nWHAM!\nA sharp kick slammed into the back of Rudolph's knee, making him drop slightly. Before he could recover—\nDHAK!\nRyan's fist crashed into Rudolph's face with all the force he could muster.\nYet—\nRudolph didn't even blink. His head didn't budge an inch.\nRyan's eyes widened. His knuckles stung, but it was as if he had punched a damn boulder.\nA slow grin stretched across Rudolph's face as a shadow flickered behind Sheldon.\nThe silver-haired fighter barely had time to react. His instincts screamed at him—he ducked. But—\n\"Wrong move, Shelly~\" A playful, honeyed voice teased.\nAnnabelle didn't lunge in for close combat. Instead, she unleashed her power. A surge of lightning crackled from her Shard, arcs of blue-white energy lashing out. The air sizzled. Sparks danced along Sheldon's back as a violent shock tore through him.\nSeizing the opening, Rhea flipped her Shards in a fluid motion. A sleek crossbow formed in her hands, humming with power. She wasted no time—her fingers pulled the trigger. A streak of glowing energy shot forward, an arrow forged from her very soul, whistling through the air toward the training doll.\nThe victory was within reach.\nThen—\nThe figure struck by lightning didn't stumble. It didn't fall. It shattered.\nWith a sound like crumbling ash, the body disintegrated into dust, vanishing before their eyes.\nAnd in the next instant—\nSnap.\nThe advancing arrow never found its mark. A hand—Sheldon's hand—clamped down on it from behind the doll. His silver hair shimmered under the training ground's lights as he stood there, untouched.\nHis fingers tightened.\nCRUNCH.\nThe arrow broke like brittle glass, fragments scattering at his feet. And before him, the training doll remained pristine—completely unscathed.\nEveryone in the training hall was struck silent after seeing the Vice-president of the student council using his strength, his Shard, and his wits to win the found.\n\"That...was excellent.\" Austin couldn't help but mutter under his breath. Neither he nor anyone else spotted Sheldon placing one of his clones before the training doll as if it were his real body.\nJust as everyone, including Sheldon, thought that the match was over,\n**SHLINK**\nSeveral slashes were delivered to the training doll, leaving several dark marks on it.\nSheldon's eyes widened as he looked at the person—only to get startled upon seeing the person hanging down a rope, attached to the ceiling.\nRyan.\nWith a grin, Ryan dropped to the ground as he said, \"You forgot about me, no?\"\nSheldon rested his hands on his waist as he said, \"Completely. Damn...since when you were there?\"\nRyan told him, \"Just when you were distracted by Rudolph, I got the time.\"\nRyan had the plan to ambush him after everyone tried their best. If they had inflicted damage to the doll, he would have refrained. But it seems, it was a good idea to wait until the end.\nAustin and others drew closer to the guy, before the Council President said, \"You made a severe mistake, Sheldon. A defender doesn't engage in battle, rather, they just try to keep their enemy away from the target. You became too busy with Rudolph to notice me and Ryan.\"\nSheldon sighed in exasperation, \"Have you seen him? He landed like a golem and was radiating such an intense blood lust that I couldn't help myself.\"\nRudolph grinned, \"Thanks for the compliment.\"\nSheldon rolled his eyes before he turned towards Annabelle and said, \"I told you that I am not good with defense.\"\nRhea voiced, \"But you successfully blocked three of us, even though there would be only two raiders during the battle. So we can't call this a complete failure.\"\nEveryone, including Austin, agreed to her words, as the blond Prince said, \"You really utilized your Shard's ability in the best possible way. And I think, if you get more time to plan things, you could have performed better.\"\nSheldon rubbed the back of his head as he said, \"Praising your rival...are you forfeiting now or something?\"\nAustin grinned, \"That is impossible. I am going to give the examination.\"\nSheldon shrugged, \"Well, best of luck then.\"\nSoon everyone dispersed. Austin was taking his position before the training doll, and unexpectedly, this time, Rhea was absent from plain sight.\nHe tried looking around but couldn't find the pink head at all—however, Ryan was with others, so that was a relief.\n'Not depending on the same strategy, eh?' Austin cracked his fingers and did some light stretching.\nBased on his performance now, his life in the tournament would be decided.\nIt would be a lie to say that he wasn't nervous. However, if he surrenders before this kind of difficulty, then he should rather hide from the dangers that are about to appear.\n\"Austin, ready?\" Annabelle asked as she seemed prepared to lunge at him.\nThe blond one nodded, before she declared, \"BEGIN!\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Valerie doesn't pray generally. However, at the moment, she was praying for her Lord's success.\nIt wasn't that she didn't believe in his abilities; rather, sometimes bad luck also changes the end result. And she really didn't want her beloved to lose because of bad luck.\nHe has been tormented and badmouthed for all his life. She has seen him go through all that with a bold front. He fought back and tried to change himself. All because he never wanted to settle with the tag of a loser.\nAnd now, he has the chance to show the world that he has changed. That all his hard work has finally paid off. She wanted the world to witness his glorious moment. And for that, he has to win this test.\n'Come on, Austin, you can do it.'\n...\n\"Begin!\" The voice of the Council President roared before Austin saw a familiar war hammer advancing toward him in a horizontal path.\nHe was standing right before the training doll, and at that pace, blocking the Shard was nearly impossible, unless he was prepared to allow some damage to be dealt to the doll.\nEveryone watched with a frown, as Austin didn't move from his spot; rather, he seemed too relaxed for someone about to be hit by such a heavy weapon.\nHowever, before the hammer could have struck him,\n**BOOOOOM**\nSomething came rushing from the sky and intercepted the Shard—carving it into the ground\n\"Agh...that hurts.\" Rudolph winced as he saw his Shard plummeted into the ground by the huge boomerang, Austin always carries.\n\"When did he throw that away...\" Ryan muttered, but Annabelle wasn't in the mood to praise her junior.\nWielding her golden staff, she jumped in the air and directed a torrent of electricity toward Austin.\nAustin grinned, as he summoned Raijin and just thrust it forward.\n\"What the...\" Rudolph exclaimed, and Annabelle's eyes widened as she saw the axe materializing into his hand and absorbing the electricity as if Anna were fueling it.\nLanding on the ground, she pushed forward, increasing the thunder as the surroundings were illuminated with her attack.\nThat much lightning would have killed a non-awakened and would surely have put a low-ranking warrior into hospital.\nAnnabelle believed that there must be a limit to how much he could absorb...but,\n\"Endless pit...\" She muttered, in disbelief and slight irritation.\n\"Don't lose hope yet!\" Ryan shouted as he lunged toward Austin with his dagger(he wasn't using his Shard).\nAustin also summoned his dagger, having Raijin's work done, before he intercepted Ryan's attempt to reach the training doll.\n*CLANG*\nTheir blades met in a flurry of attacks.\nRyan gritted his teeth and pressed forward, his dagger flashing as he unleashed a series of rapid strikes. But Austin was faster. His dagger split into two in an instant, and he met every strike with a precise counter.\nClang! Clang! Clang!\nRyan slashed, and Austin parried. Ryan lunged, and Austin sidestepped.\nThen, with a sharp flick of his wrist, Austin's left dagger hooked around Ryan's blade, yanking it off course. In the same motion, his right dagger shot forward, forcing Ryan back.\nRyan barely avoided a cut to his side. He spun, trying to regain control, but Austin didn't let up. His daggers blurred as he attacked from both sides, forcing Ryan to retreat step by step.\nRyan was ready to summon his Shard, and was about to continue the battle—however, Austin never advanced towards him and held his position.\nRyan realized that the boy gave priority to his duty as a defender, and successfully drew his opponent away.\n\"HAAAAAA!\" Rudolph roared as he jumped in the air, trying to intimidate Austin just like he did with Sheldon.\nHowever, before he could have landed, Austin summoned his Axe again and launched thunder towards the falling figure.\n\"Aghhh!\" Rudolph winced as he lost his momentum and began to fall down a straight path.\nThe lightning was not hurting much, but he was completely blinded, and it felt like several mosquitoes were sucking his blood at once.\n*WOOSH*\nAustin twisted his body, dodging the staff by a hair's breadth.\nBefore Annabelle could pull back, his hand snapped around her wrist like a steel trap, while his other hand seized the back of her collar.\nHer breath hitched. \"Wha——\"\nShe didn't even get to finish.\nWith sheer force, Austin ripped her off her feet, his leg sweeping under hers before he slammed her straight into the ground—face-first.\nEven Valerie winced from the side...that was brutal.\nAustin instantly let go and looked around—ready to intercept any attack that they might be planning.\nAustin's fingers uncurled from his daggers, his sharp gaze sweeping the area, ready for anything.\nBut the fight was already over. The three raiders lay on the ground, unmoving. None of them so much as twitched.\nHis stance loosened for a fraction of a second—until a cold realization slammed into him.\nThree?\nHis heart lurched.\nSWISH!\nA pink energy arrow streaked through the air.\nAustin barely had time to turn his head. His pupils shrank as he caught sight of it—a glowing blur cutting toward the training doll from the right.\nClose. Too close.\nHis heartbeat pounded in his ears.\nNo one moved. No one breathed.\nRhea had fired from nearly point-blank range. Even Valerie wouldn't have made it in time.\nAnd Austin?\nHe couldn't move.\nThe arrow was already there.\nIt was over.\nBut then—\nTING!\nThe sharp sound rang through the silence.\nEveryone flinched.\nRhea's lips parted in shock. \"…Huh?\"\nThe pink glow vanished, deflected mid-air.\nA greenish shimmer spread around the training doll—a barrier.\nThe doll stood untouched. Safe.\nThe battle wasn't over.\nAustin had still won.\n\"Times up!\" Valerie shouted, uncharacteristic of her.\nHowever, no one moved, nor did they speak. Their eyes were still focused on the barrier that appeared on the training doll and disappeared in the next instance.\nIt was a funny sight to see Annabelle lying on the ground and looking at the doll with an upturned gaze.\nAustin helped her get up first, before he asked them, \"Shall we talk in the Command Camp?\"\nAnnabelle opened her small mouth, but then she closed it and nodded.\nValerie had a face full of smiles as she hugged his arm and whispered, \"You did well.\"\nAustin smiled at her as he wordlessly led her to the Command Camp with others behind them.\nOnce inside, Austin first made everyone sit down before he began, \"I know you all have questions, but I cannot answer them all. Just know that I didn't use any artifact to summon that barrier or any other underhanded method. So I won't be breaking any rules.\"\n\"No, no, tell me something first...\" Rhea got up from her seat, and asked in a low tone, \"Did you re-awakened?\"\nAustin shared a glance with Valerie before he answered, \"I-In a way, yes.\"\nRhea fell down on her seat, and her eyes widened.\nAfter that, a series of questions followed.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you all liked the chapter.

      "content": "After he explained things to everyone and was finally declared to be the defender of the team, Austin and Valerie were allowed to return to their rooms.\nNaturally, the others returned too since they have to train tomorrow with the squad so they need to recover their bodies.\nWhile they walked with their hands connected, Austin heard his lover muttering, \"I can't express how happy I am right now…it feels like we have won the tournament already.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"So confident…we need to go through two more rounds, you know.\"\nValerie hugged his arm, her body warmth vivid to him, as she said, \"It doesn't matter…I felt victorious today seeing you pass the test.\"\nThe current Valerie was full of happiness. She was actually humming with joy and swaying his arm unintentionally which showed that the parameters of her happiness were broken.\n'So many achievements my past self had…but nothing more than a congratulatory message I received…and here…' Call him an emotional fool, but right now, Austin was touched by her current behavior.\nSoon, they reached before the dorm wing.\nAlthough Valerie longed to cuddle with him and share a few words meant only for her Lord, she couldn't break the rules by entering his room. Besides, Sheldon was likely already there, and in her own room, the President awaited. There was simply no option.\nUpon seeing the longing look in her eyes, Austin glanced around before pulling Valerie behind a tree.\nThe girl was taken by surprise upon finding herself being pressed against the tree. Her Lord's big frame completely covered any passerby's gaze.\nShe appeared smaller, trapped in his arms, as Austin looked down at her with his eyes darkened.\n\"Didn't receive any reward for winning my first round nor for getting my spot in the squad. Is my lady becoming unfair slowly?\"\nValerie blushed, \"Y-You demanded something unexpected…\"\nAustin grinned, as he brought his hand to her flat belly and said, \"Although I would love to make this plump a little, for now, I would satisfy myself by just this…\"\nHis words faded into the background as her mind fixated on the warmth pressing against her lips.\nThis wasn't her first kiss, yet she still hadn't grown used to the sensation. That would explain why her fingers curled tightly into his shirt, why her breath hitched as his lips moved against hers—gentle at first, then more insistent.\nA shiver ran down her spine when his hand slid up her back, pulling her closer until not even air could slip between them. His other hand traced the curve of her jaw, his thumb brushing her cheek before tilting her chin up, deepening the kiss. Heat pooled in her chest as his tongue teased against her lips, coaxing her to part them.\nShe yielded, a soft sigh escaping her as their tongues met, the slow, intoxicating rhythm stealing what little remained of her restraint. Her knees weakened, and if not for his firm grip, she might have melted right into him.\nTheir tongues moved in perfect sync, a heated dance despite her shy hesitation. Austin was completely lost in her sweet, addictive taste of her, unable to get enough.\nHe loved her—so damn much. And it showed in the way he held her, his grip firm, almost desperate as if he never wanted to let go.\nWhen their lips finally parted, Austin barely had a moment to catch his breath before instinct took over. Without thinking, he pressed a lingering kiss to her chin, then another just below it. Slowly, he trailed down, his lips brushing over the delicate skin of her neck, drawing a quiet gasp from her.\nHis hands roamed her back, pulling her impossibly closer as his lips continued their descent. When he reached her pristine collarbone, he lingered, then bit down ever so gently before soothing the spot with another kiss. A faint, possessive mark bloomed on her skin, claiming her in a way words never could.\n\"Austin…\" She suddenly uttered his name, and that was like a cold bucket of water as Austin suddenly parted his eyes and realized what he was doing.\nHe instantly backed away, not releasing her but surely loosening his grip as he apologized, \"I-I am sorry…I just-\"\n\"No, it's okay. I don't mind, really. It's just I heard some people coming this way.\" Valerie could never reject her Lord's advances. She has already devoted her mind, body, and soul to him. But if he had gone any further, she knew she wouldn't have been able to hold her voice and let everyone know what was happening here.\nAustin felt extremely guilty. He really lost his control because of her reactions and how soft he felt in his arms.\nLowering his head, he said, \"I am sorry…and thank you for stopping me.\" Holding her hand he resumed their walk as he said, \"Does it hurt?\" He asked while glancing at the slight reddish mark on her neck.\nValerie sweetly smiled, \"No, it's okay.\"\nAustin helplessly asked, \"Do you hate this possessive me?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"I absolutely love and welcome it. After all, you aren't the only one.\"\nAustin felt a little better upon hearing her words as they reached the partition where they needed to go their separate ways.\nKissing her forehead delicately, he voiced, \"Good night, love. See you tomorrow.\"\nA smiling Valerie hummed before she reluctantly released his hand and walked toward her room.\n'His warmth…it's still here…' Touching the slight bruising on her skin, her smile only widened.\nIt was a day full of sweetness~\n*CLICK*\nEntering her room she found the President taking things out of her bag as she said, \"Hello.\"\n\"Hey,\" Valerie responded shortly as she thought of advancing toward the bathroom since she urgently…needed to change her clothes.\nBut then Annabelle turned toward her and her eyes landed on the mark on her neck as she asked, \"What is that mark? Did the mosquito bite you?\"\nValerie's face turned hot a little but she controlled her emotions and nodded. Naturally, she wasn't a shameless woman to flaunt her relationship goals to someone else.\nTaking her clothes, she was about to enter the bathroom—thinking that she fooled the President, when suddenly,\n\"Calling your lover a mosquito, is not very sweet of you, my precious junior~~\"\nValerie flinched, but she didn't stop and entered the bathroom before closing the door with a strong thud.\nAnnabelle laughed heartily seeing the ever-stoic girl being so shy.\n-----^^-----\nA/N:- I hope you all enjoyed reading the chapter. If I write R-18 it would be like the kissing scene. Hot, steamy but not full-on smutty.\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "Things have been quite peaceful in Eryndor for some time now.\nSince the day the First Prince's secret was exposed and a truce was established with Drenovar, Cedric had somehow found peace. Even with several upper council seats left vacant after the minister's involvement in Aiden's dark plans was revealed, Cedric felt no sense of panic.\nHe just knew that everything would be reorganized sooner or later.\nMaybe because he knew that their biggest enemy was no longer wary of them? Or maybe because they have gotten rid of the pests that were corroding the nation from within?\nNo, it's not just that. The reason why Cedric seemed so relaxed these days was because he knew that even if he passed away today, there would be a responsible ruler who would take care of the throne.\nYes, Austin has taken an oath that he would never accept the throne, but he knows his son. If the situation becomes dire and the nation seems to be falling under the shades of danger, Austin would respond to the situation better than Cedric.\nCall it a father's partial judgment, but he just knows it.\n\"You seem to be smiling a lot recently, my lord.\" Sebastian, who brought tea for him, asked with a faint smile on his face.\nCedric gave a slight chuckle as he said, \"Was thinking about my son.\"\nIf there was a smile on his face—a proud one at that—then Sebastian doesn't need to ask which son was on his mind.\nAs Sebastian rested the tray on the table, he heard the Supreme Authority saying, \"Tell me, Sebas…you have been close to the boy ever since he left for the academy. What changed him so suddenly…like, the Austin I see now is like a more mature and sensible person compared to before.\"\nSebastian warmly responded, \"You should thank Lady Valerie for that…she helped him realize that this world is not only filled with hateful people. She helped him grow over his suffering phase and allowed the young master to become the man he is now. Naturally, it was the young master's own effort as well since he wanted to become a reliable and strong man on whom the lady could depend.\"\nCedric hummed, \"You're right. Even when his parents turned their backs on him, that girl never left his side and kept trying.\"\nHe was about to say something further, but then someone knocked on the door, garnering the two men's attention.\n\"Your Majesty, the dinner.\" It was a maid who held the tray of food in her hands.\nCedric got up from his seat before Sebastian picked up the emptied cup.\nNo one said anything as the King picked up the tray and carried it toward his room.\nA royalty doing such a job is generally unheard of. However, no one could come between a husband and wife so none of the servants even tried.\n*CLICK*\nCedric opened the door and walked inside the room.\nAs always, the room was dark since his wife didn't like sunlight these days.\nShe mostly remains in the room and barely responds to anyone except for him.\nIt was the etiquette ingrained in her since childhood that even in this condition she couldn't bring herself to disrespect her Lord by not responding to him.\nHer behavior was strange when she was under the control of that evil being, but Cedric has already forgiven his wife for that.\n\"Did you have good sleep?\" He asked as he proceeded inside the room and rested the food tray on the tea table.\nSophie hummed as she asked, \"Why did you bring it yourself? Could have told someone else...\"\n\"And had you skipped another meal? No, dear, that's not something I can allow anymore.\" Cedric said as he pulled the chair for his wife and ushered her to sit down.\nSophie's eyes were drawn downwards as she muttered, \"I try my best to eat the meals...but you know...\"\n\"Yes, I know. And I am not forcing you to recover soon. Take your time.\" With a warm smile, he added, \"However, don't expect me to not take care of you.\"\nSophie might be the only lady in the world, who, despite crossing her boundaries as a wife and a Queen, was still forgiven and was still loved by her husband, all the same.\nOn one hand, she knew that she should appreciate it and try to get out of this phase and face reality so she wouldn't trouble her husband anymore.\n...however, whenever her mind went back to that incident at the royal court, and all the instances she spent with Aiden...she felt herself getting caged in guilt and sorrow.\nCedric scooped some rice dipped in curry—his wife's favorite—before bringing it near her lips.\nSophie slowly parted her lips and took a bite.\nWhile she chewed slowly, she heard her husband's voice, \"I got the news today that Austin had got a position in the squad by defeating Duke Runebound's scion. He will be participating with a team and will face the Elites from a different academy.\"\nThere was unhidden pride and elation in the man's voice as if he was flaunting his own achievements.\nSophie's heart ached to hear the news, as she heard him continuing.\nCedric drew closer to the woman, and asked her, \"Parents are allowed to come to witness their children participate in the group matches.\"\nFor a moment, when she heard that, a faint smile appeared on her lips\nWatching Austin perform before everyone...getting praised and cheered by others.\nHowever, soon her smile disappeared and moisture appeared in her eyes\nShaking her head, she muttered, \"I can't...I shouldn't. I don't deserve to be called his mother w-when...I have neglected him all his life. I have no right to be a part of his happiness when I wasn't there for him when he was suffering.\"\nShe...cannot run away from reality anymore.\nDespite how much a part of her mind continued to take Aiden's side, Sophie had long realized that Aiden was not her son but someone who came to take revenge on them. A person who sought destruction and never considered her as his mother.\nShe had long realized that, in her efforts to provide Aiden with the familial warmth he lacked, she had neglected Austin.\nHowever, realizing her mistake didn't grant her forgiveness. In the first place, she didn't dare to seek forgiveness since she knew that even if Austin forgave her—which he might do considering he was nothing like his mother—their relationship would never get back to how it was before Aiden's arrival.\n\"Dear,\" Cedric gently held his wife's hand, before he said, \"Our wounds will always sting unless we do something about it. Just knowing that there is a wound would only continue to hurt.\"\nSophie released a sob, \"But this wound would never heal...I know.\"\nCedric sighed, \"But we can at least try, can't we? Isn't that our duty as parents? He's hurt… deeply disappointed in us… but if we simply accept this outcome, who will suffer the most?\"\nSophie didn't say anything, but her voice was visible.\nIt was the sound of her crying that resonated in the room.\nCedric remained there, hugging his wife and coaxing her to the best of his capability.\nHe may have convinced his wife to approach their son. And now, it all depends on how Austin responds to her initiative.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you all had a good day. Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"Are you nuts?\" A voice, standing in the darkness, asked the other person.\nIt was within the boundaries of the venue where the Tournament was taking place.\nInside the changing room provided in the gymnasium, two figures stood and talked in a hushed voice.\n\"I have decided. No one can change my decision now.\" The other being responded. His voice was guttural, almost inhumane.\nThe other person was a woman, who clearly seemed displeased when she said, \"My plan was going so smoothly and now...can't you wait until the last round? I will take care of him by then.\" The woman protested against what the man proposed before.\nHowever, the stance of the other one didn't change, \"I can't. Ever since I saw her that day...I can't stop thinking about her. A strong woman needs a strong man by her side. I know she won't be satisfied by that puny human. She needs me, as much as I need her.\"\nThere was a very faint sense of obsession that was laced in his voice when he talked about the third person.\nThe other person grumbled, \"Tch, you and your strange obsession with strange things. Anyway, you do know what will happen if you fail this time right? Lord Zargon will chew you alive.\"\nThe man scowled, \"I don't fear anything. These people are weak, and the only strong defender they have will be my target.\"\nThere was a brief pause before the woman voiced, \"Remember, you can't have him. He is mine, and I won't tolerate any damage dealt to him.\" The woman's aura flared only to the point where she reminded the other one of her status.\nThe other person scoffed, \"Then just go ahead and take him. What's stopping you from hunting a mere human?\"\nThe woman coquettishly smiled a smile which made even the other one waver for a moment, before she said, \"The fun of the hunt is only when you have the prey wrapped around your finger and torment them before delivering the final blow. Don't spoil the fun for me~\"\n*Knock*\n\"Monica? How long?\" Suddenly, someone knocked on the door, making the woman, who was now identified as Monica, flinch.\n\"Just a second,\" She said before tying her hair and telling the person beside her, \"It's on the third day. Don't mess it up this time.\"\nNo response came in response as Monica advanced towards the door, and the other person faded into darkness.\n°°°°°°°°\n\"You look tired,\" Esner asked as he and Rhea walked side by side.\nRhea sighed, \"Yeah, team training was tougher than individual one.\" It turned out Austin, who has barely participated in any raid before, was actually better than her in teamwork.\nTo not drag down her team, she pushed herself to the limits and did her best to hear the commands and act on them.\nSince Elara was forced to participate in the training, they were divided into two teams, and thankfully, despite Rhea's clumsiness, they won during the practice battle.\nWell, it was to be expected considering they had Valerie on their team. She is fast, strong, and proactive in decision-making. She doesn't stick to the orders if she sees the opportunity. And most of all, regardless of the situation, she retains a calm head. And that is the most crucial factor to win.\nEsner smiled at the girl, \"Do you want to have something warm and relaxing? Wait I will bring it for you.\"\n\"Ah!\" Before Rhea could have stopped him, Esner went inside the common hall.\nLeft alone, she sat down on the nearby bench.\nEsner was a good person and because of their random meetings, they have gotten closely acquainted as well.\nEven when she was struggling with Rudolph, he suddenly appeared before her and helped her collect herself.\nA strange who became her friend in no time.\nShe knew she shouldn't make friends with someone who comes from a nation that holds animosity against Eryndor, but she couldn't push away a person, especially when have only good intentions toward you.\n\"Here,\" Esner soon appeared before her, while holding a paper cup.\nRhea's brows elevated as she received the scent of freshly crushed beans from the cup.\nTaking a sip, she was delighted to find milk coffee inside, before she asked in a surprise, \"How did you know that I don't like sugar in my coffee?\"\nEsner froze for a moment, then he blinked and casually said, \"I also don't like it...so I asked the server out of habit.\"\nRhea smiled, \"It's the same for me. I don't like sweet things much.\"\nEsner nodded as he was about to sit down beside her when suddenly, \"What are you doing here, student Rhea.\"\nEsner flinched for a moment, but then he retained his calm demeanor and following Rhea, he also turned towards the bespectacled man.\n\"Professor Morkel...I was just relaxing after a long training session.\" The girl responded.\nMorkel crossed his arms on his chest before he said, \"I don't want to be harsh here, but there is a chance that our team will go against Avalon Academy during the second stage. And for you two to stay close...you know that it can affect your matches, right?\"\nRhea's eyes widened slightly...she really didn't think it was like that.\nMorkel soon followed, \"Now think, if by any chance you fail to perform well, because of any other reasons, against the Avalon...won't your team and the other say that you let them win for the sake of your friendship.\"\nEsner gritted his teeth hearing the man's nonsensical words. The only reason he didn't allow his aura to leak was because of the girl beside him.\nThe pinkhead understood the severity of the matter before she apologized, \"I understand. Sorry, sir.\"\nTurning towards the boy, she said, \"I apologize Esner, but until we finish our matches, we shouldn't meet. Bye.\"\nEsner barely managed to squeeze his lips in a smile, as he said, \"I understand.\"\nNot so long after, Rhea excused herself and walked away.\nOnce she left, Esner also decided to leave, considering he might lose his control and attack the d*ckhead.\nHowever, just as he turned, \"Long time, Park.\"\nEsner flinched upon hearing that name before he instantly spun on his feet and looked at the man.\n\"How did you...\"\n\"Oh, I observed you. Your behavioral pattern, the way you talk, and the way you were roaming around Rhea...it was simple, really.\"\nParkinson gritted his teeth, his soul energy making the air heavy, as the boy voice, \"What do you need?\"\n\"Oh, I need nothing from you. I just came to warn you about something.\" With a grin that looked nothing but nasty in Park's eyes, Morkel uttered, \"Rhea believes that the order to exile Austin in exchange for receiving help from Hener was your doing.\"\nAll the color from his face vanished, as he asked in a louder tone, \"What proposal?!\"\nMorkel chuckled, \"You don't know? Well, you should ask your parents then. As for Rhea, don't let her know that it's you, or she might come after your life~\" Saying so, Morkel walked away leisurely.\nHe just wanted to warn the boy and remind him where he stands in Rhea's life.\n'Your closed, so don't try to come near her anymore.'\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Do you want to see the group exercise?

      "content": "Valerie moved through the forest, closely listening to the sound of collision from far ahead as she prepared to help the raiders from her side.\nThe training site was situated in the forest which explains why she was having a hard time moving through the terrain.\nFinally, she reached a clearing where Rhea was engaged in a battle with Ryan.\nAlthough the two of them were of the same rank, Ryan was simply overwhelming the girl because of the experience he held\nRyan was much like Rhea—someone who was allowed to risk his life to gain experience. However, unlike the pinkhead, who was much more focused on refining her skills, Ryan utilized his time to attain combat experience.\nValerie could see that Rhea was getting pushed away, and if things continued like this, their team raider would be out of the game in the first few minutes.\nValerie summoned her Shard and was about to end this battle by encasing Ryan—when suddenly, she heard,\n[Val, don't freeze him up but just intimidate him.]\nIt was the artifact they recently acquired from Morkel that allowed long-range communication. It was an artifact that the Council would have allotted them for the match, but the Professor already had them, so he provided them for a better training experience.\nIt uses the same technology and magic as the communication devices used by soldiers in border areas. However, its range was significantly reduced since military-grade equipment was banned for civilian use—even for Elite students.\nHearing the voice of her Lord, she frowned just for a moment but didn't question his judgment.\nTapping Shiverfall on the branch she was standing, she sent several ice spikes hurling in Ryan's direction\n\"Woah!\" The boy jumped back, nearly dodging the attack that surely would have made him bleed.\nFlipping in the air to retreat a little, he looked at the chanter of the spell.\nValerie didn't stop there; she jumped from the tree, and an ice platform was built under her foot, allowing her to skate her way to her opponent.\nRyan felt the temperature around him dropping as he raised his battle axe and got prepared.\nHowever, Valerie was simply too overpowered for him.\nShe swung her spear from a distance, and several ice shards shot toward him.\n\"Shit!\" The boy cursed before he covered himself with his Axe to save his face from getting scarred by those tiny little devils.\n*CLINK* *CLINK*\nThose shards that struck his weapon were shattered but many more of them damaged the other, uncovered part of his body.\nRyan was getting pushed back, and he knew he couldn't continue this any longer, so he called out, \"ELARA!\"\nA figure appeared behind Valerie, holding her kunai and a vicious expression on her face.\nHowever, before she could have attacked Valerie,\n**BOOOOOM**\nAn arrow struck her back, throwing Elara straight toward Valerie.\nThe violette tilted her body before Elara crashed into the iced platform.\n[Rhea, keep them engaged.]\nRhea received the message before she reloaded her Shard and shot another arrow toward Elara and Ryan.\n\"Move!\" Ryan held Elara and moved away.\nElara yelped as she found herself being thrown away.\n[Valerie, proceed.]\nUpon receiving the order, Valerie shared a glance with Rhea before they shared a nod, and the spear wielder dashed toward the target.\nThe only reason Valerie was told to intimidate Ryan was because Austin wanted to pull Elara to the battle.\nWith his restricted powers(Valerie was told not to go all out in the training battles), Valerie might have had a hard time fighting against Rudolph and Elara, which is why it was necessary to detach them.\nAustin smiled as he awaited the good news since he knew his lover would take care of Rudolph.\n\"You look quite happy~\" Someone launched toward Austin, which ushered the blond to raise his Shard and prepare for the battle.\nHowever, the moment Sheldon and Austin's blades were about to clash,\n*SPOOOF*\nSheldon dissolved into clouds before Austin realized what it was.\nThe real Sheldon appeared behind the training doll, his blade raised.\nHis dagger was inches away from slaying the doll, when suddenly,\n**BOOOOM**\nSomething came rushing down from the sky and plummeted Sheldon to the ground.\nAustin smirked as he turned towards his classmate, ready to provide him a helping hand—when he was genuinely surprised to find no one pressed under Wisp.\n*Slash*\nAustin gritted his teeth as he heard the slash before he turned abort and found Sheldon standing on top of the training doll leisurely.\n\"You refrained from using your barrier, and now look what it caused you.\"\nThere were two large slashes on the training doll, which meant the end.\nAustin exhaled a sigh before he nodded, \"I understand....but here, in the open, I am slightly hesitant to show all my cards.\"\nShdon hummed, understanding what he meant. He didn't say anything and jumped from the wounded equipment.\nSoon, the others began to gather around them before Annabelle confirmed, \"Valerie damaged the doll before you, so it's apparently our victory.\"\nTurning towards Austin, she added, \"Nice work dictating orders. You did better than me.\"\nAustin forced himself to smile, but inwardly, he was quite bitter, losing against Sheldon.\nHe really didn't think that Sheldon would use his clones in such a way. And it didn't end there,\n*SPOOF*\nThe Sheldon, right before them, also disappeared in a white cloud before the real Sheldon appeared from the forest.\n\"You had a backup plan if you had failed the third time too?\" Austin asked, evidently amazed.\nSheldon shrugged, \"That's the ability of my Shard, so surely I will go all out to fool my opponent.\"\n\"You should keep your head high, though, Austin. You could have easily defended the target if you had used your barrier. So, in a way, it's your victory.\" Rudolph complimented.\nValerie wordlessly nodded in support.\nAustin exhaled an audible breath, before he asked, \"So...should we go another round?\"\n\"No way! I am tired.\" The one who grumbled and complained was the redhead in the group.\nRhea, who was just beside her, nodded with her eyes droopy, \"I am tired too...can't continue.\" They have always gone for five rounds since morning and she could barely feel her legs now.\nAnabelle chuckled as she said, \"Yeah, we should stop now. We have to gather at the arena to watch the first round of the squad matches as well.\"\nToday, fortunately, they weren't listed to face the first round.\nHaving zero information about the round was too disadvantageous. That's why, it seems, they chose the top two academies—Ravencourt and Auroracrest—to play the first round.\nOn that note, everyone decided to return to their rooms and rest for some time.\n\"Do you want to have some breakfast?\" Austin asked as he and Valerie walked together.\n\"How about in a few minutes? I am too sweaty right now.\"\nWhen she said that, Austin was suddenly reminded of something as he asked, \"Why were you wearing a high neck during the whole session?\"\nThe others wore clothes designed for ease of movement, but when it came to Valerie, comfort was the last word that came to mind.\nValerie was embarrassed, but she showed him, by pulling the zipper.\n\"...!!\" Austin's eyes stretched a little when he saw the glaring love bite on her collar bone which he left on her last night.\n\"It wasn't this profound last night, but in the morning...that's why...I covered it.\" She wasn't ashamed of having the trophy of love; rather, she didn't want others to comment on it and have Valerie lose her composure.\nAnd there was a chance she would have embarrassed her Lord as well if she had roamed with the kiss mark.\n\"Val...why didn't you apply a potion on it?\"\nValerie blinked, and then a very slight bulge appeared on her cheek as she said, \"I will never make it disappear...Rather I want to have it for the rest of my life.\"\nDrawing closer to him, she whispered, \"It reminds me that my Lord is possessive of me.\"\nAustin helplessly smiled at her thoughts before he told her, \"Okay, don't apply potion, but rather than wearing a high-neck and dehydrating yourself, how about you apply a bandage there to hide it?\"\nValerie hummed, \"I will think about it.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- This arc won't last for long.

      "content": "[Name: Gorrak]\n[Rank: B]\n[Points: 2000]\n....\nSo here it was. The main boss of the second dungeon.\nAustin was standing in the waiting area after he defeated all the mob soldiers.\nHe was tired and wounded all over.\nAnnihilating more than a hundred giants was not easy.\nIt may be the toughest mob battle he had until now.\nEntities full of brute force. Sure, they were easy to fool and weren't fast enough to chase after him—even once Austin had got into their grasp, nothing other than brutal death awaited.\nHe was surviving all because of his agility and coordination with his weapons.\nHe has already lost the Absolute Barrier during the mob hunting, so he couldn't become careless during the final battle.\n'Well...in front of that thing, I would be damned to become careless.' Austin muttered under his breath as he saw the thirty-foot tall Orc Lord, standing with his battle hammer resting beside him.\nA walking mountain of muscle and scars. His gray-green skin was thick like iron, stretched over bulging sinews that pulsed with raw power. Jagged bone plates jutted from his shoulders and arms, trophies of countless battles. His massive tusks, stained with old blood, curled upward like savage blades.\nHis eyes burned like molten embers, filled with hatred and hunger. Each breath rumbled like a growling beast.\nAustin knew he wouldn't be able to win against this thing without support.\n'Let's see...' He peeked at his points table and found he had accumulated over twenty-two hundred points until now.\nTaking a deep breath, Austin made the decision, \"System, buy me the Ashen Maul.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Command accepted!]\nAs those words faded, Austin raised his hand and a weapon began to materialize in his hands.\nThe mace has a four-foot-long handle, crafted from dark, reinforced steel with a slight curve for better grip and control. The surface is wrapped in thick, weathered leather, ensuring a firm hold even in the bloodiest battles.\nAt its top, the head of the mace is a brutal sphere of blackened iron, nearly twice the size of a human skull. Jagged, razor-sharp spikes protrude from it in an uneven pattern, designed to crush armor, shatter bones, and tear through flesh with every strike.\n\"It's heavy ..\" Austin muttered as he swung the weapon slightly. It was quite heavier than Raijin...almost like he was holding a tree.\n'What's the special effect of the weapon?' Austin actually just took it because he was searching for a high-ranking damage-dealing weapon...without knowing the effect it could produce.\n[Ember-effect: Each strike of the Ashen Maul leaves behind smoldering embers at the point of impact, causing a lingering burn. Repeated strikes on the same spot intensify the effect, increasing the severity of the burn with each consecutive hit.]\nAustin hummed, \"Nice.\"\nHe then went ahead and brought some potions, \"One low-rank healing and recovery potion.\"\nThe total points he spent in the items was sixteen hundred, leaving him with just six hundred points.\nAustin gulped down the potion and felt his wounds healing at a greater pace and his breath stabilizing. His legs weren't hurting as much now, and he seemed in a much better state.\nGlancing at the clock on the left, he found he only had ten seconds.\nHolding the mace with both hands, Austin muttered under his breath, \"Wish me luck, Val.\"\nAnd with those thoughts, the waiting area vanished into nothingness.\nA thunderous roar shook the battlefield.\n\"KHUAAAAANGHH!\"\nThe Orc Lord's deafening bellow sent a powerful gust ripping through the air, dust and blood spraying everywhere. But Austin didn't waver.\nHe charged forward.\nHis boots sank into the damp soil, a ground soaked not by rain—but by the blood of fallen foes. His grip tightened around his weapon, eyes locked onto the towering beast.\nAcross from him, the Orc Lord grasped his battle hammer, massive fingers curling around the handle as it loomed overhead, ready to crush him into the earth.\nBut—\n**DHWAM**\nThe hammer slammed down with the force of an earthquake. The ground shattered beneath its weight—but Austin was no longer there.\nHe had already let go of his Ashen Maul, shaking off the weight that had slowed him, and exploded forward like a cannonball.\nIn a heartbeat, he was already upon the monster, using its own skull belt as a foothold to launch himself upward.\nThe Orc Lord felt the tug at its waist. Confused, its massive head tilted downward—\nToo late.\nAustin had already leaped, his Ashen Maul reappearing in his hands mid-air.\n*CRACK*\nA sickening fracture echoed as the mace slammed into the monster's wrist.\n\"GHUOOOH!\"\nThe beast winced, a deep, guttural cry of pain shaking the battlefield.\nAustin landed, knees bending, his gaze immediately snapping to where he struck.\nAnd there it was—deep red patches seeping into the monster's thick skin.\nThe Ember Effect had begun.\nThe Orc Lord's pained wince twisted into something far more dangerous—rage.\nHis burning-red eyes locked onto Austin, and with a guttural snarl, he lunged.\n**BOOM**\nA massive foot stomped down, the sheer force blasting dirt and debris into the air. Austin barely had time to react.\n**WHAM**\nA backhand swing from the monster's colossal arm came like a battering ram, catching Austin mid-step before he could fully retreat.\n\"Ghh—!\"\nThe impact ripped the air from his lungs. His body rocketed backward, crashing into the ground, rolling through mud and shattered stone. His vision blurred, ears ringing from the hit.\nBut the Orc Lord wasn't done.\nTHUD! THUD! THUD!\nThe monster was already charging, its massive frame moving with terrifying speed. With one hand, it lifted its battle hammer again, the edge glowing red-hot from the heat of Austin's Ember Effect.\n\"HRAAAAAGH!\"\nIt swung down, aiming to crush him entirely.\nAustin, dazed but not beaten, forced himself to roll away just as the hammer obliterated the spot he had been lying in—\n**BOOM**\nThe entire ground split apart spreading like veins, chunks of dirt, and molten embers flying in every direction. The shockwave sent Austin tumbling further back, his arms stinging from the heat.\nThe blond prince gritted his teeth, pushing himself up, feeling a sharp sting along his ribs—a gash from the Orc's strike. His coat was torn, blood trickling down his side.\nAustin shoved himself upright with a grunt, his muscles protesting, but he ignored the pain. His Ashen Maul lay behind him, abandoned.\nYet, he didn't hesitate.\nHe charged forward.\nThe Orc Lord noticed. This time, the monster didn't scoff—it had learned.\nInstead of bracing itself, it launched into the air.\nAustin's eyes widened. \"What the—\"\nBefore he could react—\n**BOOOOOOM**\nThe entire dungeon quaked as the monster came crashing down. The force ripped the ground apart, sending a violent shockwave tearing through the battlefield.\nAustin's footing vanished.\nHis legs buckled, and his body lurched—he fell.\n\"Agh!\"\nThe ground below had collapsed, forming a deep crater. Austin tumbled down into it, his back slamming against a jagged rock.\nDust clouded his vision. His chest heaved as he tried to regain control—\nThen—\nA shadow loomed over him.\nAustin's breath hitched.\nThe Orc Lord towered over the crater's edge, its massive silhouette blocking out the dungeon's eerie glow.\nAnd then, he saw it—\nThe battle hammer was raised high.\nA strike meant to end him.\nPanic flared in his chest—he had no time to dodge.\n\"WISP!\"\nHe shouted on instinct.\nBefore the hammer could fall—\nSWWOOSH—!\nSomething whipped through the air, a blur of wood and force.\nCRACK!\nThe Orc Lord's head snapped sideways.\n\"KHUENG!\"\nA deep, guttural howl of pain tore from the monster's throat as it staggered back, clutching the side of its skull.\nAustin's wild eyes darted up.\nHe instantly shot away from the crater, and commanded the system,\n'Berserk, now!'\n[Command accepted!]\n[All the stats have significantly risen!]\nFeeling the surge of strength and speed in his body, Austin was a blur through the battlefield.\nHe summoned Ashen Maul in his hand before jumping into the air. His body was light and his legs were strong, which allowed him to reach the top of the Orc Lord's head.\nThe Orc Lord sensed danger as it instantly tried to raise its hammer in retaliation.\nBut it was too late.\n**DHWAK**\nThe Ashen Maul landed squarely on the skull of the monster with a strength that simply surpassed the human, Austin once was.\nThe head of the monster was split open, blood gushing out by the strike, as the ember began to seep inside its skull.\n\"Ghrueng\"\nThe Orc Lord staggered away, clutching its head as Austin landed on the ground, and darted forward once again.\nThe Orc Lord swung its weapon to keep the human away, but Austin was simply too fast for the Orc Lord to track.\nJumping in the air, Austin gripped his weapon with all his strength, and accompanied the strength he commanded,\n\"DICHARGE!\"\nAn attack that sent a tremor through the dungeon, resonated as Austin's weapon landed on the Orc's head.\nA blinding shockwave erupted.\nThe moment Austin's Ashen Maul connected with the Orc Lord's skull, a violent pulse of force detonated outward, ripping through the air like a thunderclap.\nCRACK!\nThe Orc Lord's skull erupted.\nA geyser of black ichor and shattered bone burst outward like an exploding volcano. Chunks of thick, green flesh ripped apart, flung in every direction as the sheer force of the impact detonated inside its head.\nThe orc's body convulsed violently, its massive limbs twitching as the headless corpse staggered back.\nA moment later—\nTHUUUUUD!\nThe thirty-foot titan collapsed.\nThe ground quaked as the lifeless hulk slammed into the dungeon floor, sending a final, echoing tremor through the cavern. A pool of dark blood quickly spread beneath its twitching fingers, the last remnants of life draining away.\nAustin landed with a rough roll, breathing heavily. His clothes were splattered with gore, bits of bone, and seared flesh stuck to his armor.\nWiping his sweat, he muttered, \"Berserk is a cheat ability...\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

She moved a lot during training and she is famished now.\nWhile rubbing her flat belly with a pained expression, she never saw the other person coming from behind, resulting—\n\"Ah!\" Rhea stumbled forward as the person walked hastily away without stopping to apologize.\nWhen she looked closely she found it was one of the soldiers working for the Council, which made her recall that she saw several soldiers walking around the venue previously as well.\nIt had been busy since morning, which made her curious. Since she was too tired in the morning, she didn't ask anyone. However, now,\n\"Excuse me,\" Rhea followed the soldier hastily, however, he was too fast and didn't hear her calling.\nThe pink head sighed and stopped trying. She had a feeling that even if she had stopped them, the soldiers might not have responded to her query.\nEven if there was any emergency, the venue management always prioritized keeping the students calm.\n\"Hey,\" Someone familiar appeared beside her as he asked, \"What happened?\"\nRhea turned toward Rudolph, wanting to tell him about the bizarre situation, but then she paused.\nRudolph has trimmed his hair from the side and has tied his long black hair in a rough bun. In addition to that, he was wearing a sleeveless shirt that exposed his well-shaped arms and gave an intimidating yet handsome appearance to the boy.\n\"Rhea?\" Rudolph called out to the dazed girl.\nThe dual-awakened broke out of her trance, and hurriedly said, \"It seems there is a situation going on...I saw several soldiers walking around in the morning.\"\nRudolph frowned, as he crossed his arms on his chest, as he voiced, \"I also noticed it and questioned one of them. However, they didn't answer me.\"\nRhea hummed, \"Expected,\" after pausing for a moment, she asked, \"Do you think the President might know something about it?\"\nThe Student Council President was their team leader who had come in contact with the venue managers, so she thought that the President might have something to share.\nHowever, \"No, I don't think so. This situation is not something event-related. This is...far more severe.\" Rudolph brought the girl to the side, so they didn't block others' path before he informed her,\n\"Three soldiers, whom I saw yesterday in the morning, were not at their station today.\"\nRhea was amazed, \"You notice such details? I don't even remember the soldiers who checked our belongings.\"\nRudolph chuckled, \"It's kind of habit to assess warriors around me. And when I do that, I remember their faces as well.\"\n\"No doubt you score so low during exams. Your mind is filled with people's faces after all.\" Rhea commented, only to wince as Rudolph suddenly pinched her cheek.\n\"I am sowweyyy...\" She cried before Rudolph released her and ushered the girl to move toward the table.\n\"Wait, I will bring something for you.\" Rudolph told her, and a sobbing Rhea nodded, \"You have to,\" she added.\nRudolph was smiling ear to ear while he advanced toward the food counter, and found a familiar person standing there\n\"Hey, Austin.\" Austin was in the line, waiting for his turn to order breakfast\nHearing the voice, he turned towards the guy, before flashing his brows, \"Hey, you woke up.\"\n\"I didn't sleep actually. It's kind of a habit to train that much in the morning, so I wasn't actually tired.\"\nAustin nodded, \"Can relate.\"\nThey moved up the queue as the bigger guy asked, \"Did you have some kind of buffing potion...you look juiced up a little.\"\nRudolph wasn't exaggerating. Austin's muscles were slightly more profound, and his height also seemed a few inches higher than in the morning. Not only that, his aura was much more noticeable, as if he went through an Evolution.\nAustin chuckled...so he indeed leveled up by defeating the Orc Lord.\nHe didn't get any notification from the system, but he was actually feeling a little stronger and lighter.\nHis combat and endurance stats had grown, but he hadn't checked since the moment he woke up after returning from the Dungeon; it was already too late. That's why, he hastily moved to the Common Hall to have breakfast with his lover.\n\"Well, good training as good rest did wonders.\"\nThey moved a little ahead, now Austin was just a person away from the counter, as he heard his friend saying,\n\"Why do you give the impression that despite not having your Shard going through evolutions, you are growing continuously?\"\nAustin shrugged, \"Maybe I am?\" This was no longer a secret and soon, during the second round, everyone would know that he was actually way above a D-rank.\nNaturally, they all would consider his dual awakening the reason behind his unnatural growth, just like Rhea.\nRudolph sighed, 'Seriously, these dual-awakeners are cheat existence.' he thought, before turning towards his left as someone passed by.\nSeeing the guard passing, Rudolph solemnly asked, \"Did you notice...people are disappearing from the venue.\"\nAustin also glanced at the soldier, as his brows slowly drew closer\nHe has also noticed that there have been some unnatural movements of the soldiers since this morning. He had previously heard that one of the four management chiefs had disappeared, too.\n'The Demons are here...but I cannot sense any of them.' The plan of observing Rhea didn't work as well. She didn't 'accidentally' stumble upon any being who could have been suspicious. And following Rhea everywhere was simply unthinkable.\nAs such, now all Austin can do is warn Valerie and wait for the Demons to show up.\nDespite knowing the level of danger this matter involved, he couldn't inform others about it. Having knowledge about things that shouldn't be within a human's grasp always creates doubt and suspicion.\nThe only person to whom he could share his knowledge without the fear of getting questioned back is the lady he admires the most.\nAfter taking his plates of breakfast, he returned to the table where Valerie awaited him.\nShe wanted to go and take lunch for them, but Austin insisted she wait, considering the queue was rather long this morning.\n\"Sorry to make you wait, here you go.\" He handed her the toast and coffee, while he himself had banana pancakes with honey syrup.\nThe duo were nobles who had grown up under strict tutelage that instilled etiquette and manners to their very bone.\nThe way they lifted their tableware, or how they silently sliced their food before putting it in their mouth, every single movement oozed with elegance.\nThere were not a few but many who couldn't stop looking at them, as they felt conscious about how they ate. Especially those who come from a commoner background.\nValerie glanced at her Lord before asking, \"Did you receive any letter from your family?\"\nAustin nodded, \"Sebas contacted me...it seems my father will be coming to see the match.\"\nValerie delicately smiled, \"Is that so?\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"You look happy? Do you want me to remain close to my family?\"\nValerie nodded—not hesitant, as she said, \"I want you to remain close to the one whom you genuinely respect and love. Please don't ignore him.\"\nAustin sighed, \"As you command, my lady.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Valerie knows Austin well, that's why she suggested it.\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"It was...disappointing,\" Rudolph muttered under his breath as the students cheered at Ravencourt's victory.\nSomeone who was expecting an intense clash between the top two schools, Rudolph had all the right to feel displeased at the one-sided onslaught Ravencourt presented before the spectators.\nThe other side never had the chance to retaliate in front of the offense of the Ravencourt.\nThe student named Kevin just overwhelmed the other side, showing his skills which were on par with an S-rank.\nAustin sighed as he looked at the boy whose body was radiating brilliantly with confidence and slight chagrin with all the praises that flew his way.\nThe ability to absorb the essence of the sun and use that to strengthen himself. Someone who could be an ultimate weapon against the demons if only there was a sun in the sky.\n'If my memories serve right, then he should have already gone through two evolutions and would go through another advancement by the end of this arc.' Austin muttered under his breath, as he and the others slowly got up and advanced toward the Command Tent.\nNaturally, they had a lot to discuss after they realized what they would need to do during the second stage.\nElara, unnaturally, didn't make a fuss and just silently took a seat across from Austin.\nIn the Command Tent, only the Elite members were permitted to enter.\nThe newbie division was on the other side, but they could not hear each other at all unless they were purposely listening to the other.\nThey have been handling their battles well and were in fourth overall rank by now.\nConsidering the main importance lies in the results of the Elite group, the President didn't try to meddle with their affairs, despite having a few complaints.\n\"We all saw what we have to do. Instead of just a single target to protect, there would be two. One would carry more points and one less.\"\nDuring the contest, everyone noticed that Auroracrest tried to protect both targets at once, forcing their tactician to take on too much responsibility.\nIt was a poor decision because Ravencourt wasted no time launching an all-out attack. Their two raiders and the tactician charged straight at both targets.\nBreaking the first target earned a team 100 points.\nDefeating all opponents granted 300 points.\nConquering the second target, which required a special key, awarded 500 points.\nThe problem? The key was in their opponent's hands. However, since they weren't told which enemy held the secret code, Kevin took no chances—he defeated both the raiders and the defender. Soon after, the opposing tactician fell to their own defender.\nIn the end, not only did they secure the points for capturing both locks, but they also earned extra for taking down the entire enemy team.\n\"Our goal would be to safely secure the first target and then start defeating the raiders.\" Annabelle voiced in all seriousness\nAlthough the basic structure of the round was similar, the addition of two targets made things a bit tricky.\n\"There is a high chance for the opponents to advance right toward the defense now,\" Rudolph said, thinking things from the enemy's perspective\n\"You are right; that's why we need Austin to hold his defense for at least a few minutes. We can have Valerie with him for support, but that would lessen our firepower.\" Annabelle voiced, her tone suggesting a little hesitation.\nAustin realized what was troubling her, so he assured the girl, \"My barrier would last long for a few minutes; that's why I will be protecting myself and the target with fewer points, so they score as low as possible.\"\n\"But what if I, Valerie, or the President gets the key?\" Rhea asked. Won't that make the whole point of Austin wielding an unbreakable barrier to protect the weaker target pointless?\"\n\"We can adjust based on that; if Austin or Valerie gets the key, then Austin would go for a weaker target. But if I or Rhea get the key, Austin, I want you to be near the other one.\"\nThe blond Prince nodded, \"Understood.\"\nThe discussion continued for another hour before they were told to return to their rooms.\nAnnabelle, Sheldon, and Rhea were staying for further discussion. Ryan and Elara went to their rooms while Rudolph decided to train a little.\nLeft alone, Valerie and Austin decided to eat something, since they didn't have anything after breakfast.\n\"It's going to be a difficult and tricky task,\" Austin muttered followed by a sigh, as he held his beloved hand and strolled towards the common hall.\nThings have changed now, and there is a high chance for Austin to face more than one enemy without the assistance of his team—since they mostly would be involved in finding the targets.\nWell, not like anything can penetrate the Absolute Barrier, but the duration of the shield troubles him.\n\"Don't worry, regardless of the situation, I will reach you if it gets too dangerous,\" Valerie assured as she hugged his arm.\nAustin lovingly looked at his woman, in front of whom he could release all his frustration and show what he truly felt.\nShe is the only woman he has ever dated who never judged him based on his rare nervous side.\nHe was so occupied in looking at her that he never noticed the person standing ahead, resulting—\n*DHAK*\n*CLANG*\nThe dish from the person's hand dropped to the ground and all the food it held.\nAustin was startled and so were the others in the common hall.\nEvery eye turned towards them, and before Austin could have said anything, the grey-haired boy shouted, \"What the fuck!! I stood half an hour to get it, and you goddamn mothefu*ker!!\"\nHis words and expression clearly said that he was overreacting.\nHowever, before he could have stepped forward, a chill ran down his spine.\nIt was a sensation a living being should not feel.\nThe chill of death that crept through his body and seeped into his soul.\nAnd it wasn't just the boy but everyone felt the foreboding sensation arriving from the person standing behind Austin.\nValerie's eyes held no emotion, as she stared at the guy. However, looking closely there was a storm arising in those lifeless eyes\nThe storm of agitation.\nThe boy halted mid-step, gritted his teeth, and turned around.\nAustin shook his head and exhaled a sigh. Youngster these days loses their cool so easily.\n\"You okay, Val?\" Austin turned around to ask her as he rested his hand on her shoulder.\nValerie slowly nodded when suddenly someone called out, \"Hey, Austin.\"\nHearing the voice, the blond reflexively turned toward the source—\n*Splash*\n—only to find something soft and gooey crashing against his face\n\"Ooooh~\"\n\"Damn....\"\n\"What a precise shot.\"\nMany ooh-ed seeing the scene as the boy who hit him, dashed away instantly.\nValerie's aura flared, but before she could move and possibly end the journey of the student, Austin stopped her.\n\"Wait, Val...that guy is already out of the tournament...fighting him would only cause us trouble. So let him be.\"\nAustin didn't want to get disqualified and land in the trap that the enemies had set for them. He was well aware that this was all a setup; that's why he refrained from acting on his impulse.\n....however, soon, Austin would realize that he might have underestimated the enemy.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Drop a comment.

      "content": "Austin was back in his room.\nIt took some time to convince Valerie but fortunately, she calmed down.\nHe didn’t know the name of the student, and that very fact relays that the boy was not important enough to be remembered. He must have been disqualified in the first round and wanted to have Austin or Valerie ruled out by attacking him.\nThis was nothing new or unheard of. Austin has faced these kinds of situations back in his last life as well.\nOne time, he had an important rugby match, and a day before, someone ’accidentally’ bumped their bike into him.\nHe lost consciousness and was carried to the hospital, but somehow, the next day, he recovered, and despite the Doctor’s advice, he went to play the match.\nAnd after the match, the one thug who ’accidentally’ hit him had to stay way longer in the hospital than Luke.\nSo it was nothing new, and Austin has the experience to deal with these bu**holes.\nJust don’t give in to their provocation until you pass the hurdle they don’t want you to cross. And once it’s over, beat them senseless. And Austin was going to do just that.\n\"You okay?\" As he entered the room, with the scent of cream still lingering, he heard Sheldon asking.\nThe blond one nodded, \"Yeah, everything fine.\"\nSheldon didn’t ask anything further, even though he knew exactly what happened in the common hall. However, since Austin said he was fine, Sheldon decided to not bother him.\nThe Prince walked inside the bathroom and threw away his clothes first. They were dusty and sweaty.\nDiving in the warm bath, he first washed his face and while he did, he mentally commanded,\n’Stats,’\n[Ding!]\n[Combat: 72->81/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Romance: 63->65/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[Durability: 73->85/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Trickery: 35/50]\n{Next reward at 50}\n[Overall Progression: 59->67.8/100]\n[Next Reward at 70]\n…\n[Ding!]\n[You have three rewards!]\nAustin didn’t think much before opening them,\n[Ding!]\n[Upon your combat advancement, the host has gained 300 Points]\n[Upon your durability advancement, the host has gained 200 points.]\n[Upon your trickery advancement, the host has gained the skill: Mirage Sync.]\n[Mirage Sync: Creates a phantom at a target location that repeats the user’s movements and attacks after a short delay. The mirage mimics the exact actions performed at activation and disappears after a certain time.]\nAustin had a frown on his face—what the heck?\n’Why didn’t I receive any skill or tool upon advancement?’\n[The system has nothing else to offer based on the Host’s current skill level.]\nAustin clicked his tongue, \"You could have offered a discount coupons on a few shop items.\"\nRegardless of his complaints, he knew the system wouldn’t budge so he read the description of the skill he got.\nAfter reading it twice, he asked, \"You mean to say, after activating the skill, I perform a few movements or tasks which my mirage or clone would repeat for a certain period, right?\"\n[Indeed, host! How sharp!]\nAustin rolled his eyes at the fruitless attempt of flattering him.\n’What are the limitations?’\n[The Mirage can only follow movements done within ten seconds, and the Mirage can only maintain its form for ten minutes.]\n[Note: The duration cannot be enhanced with points.]\nAustin couldn’t think of any use of this skill anytime soon. But surely, there was a long path ahead, and maybe there would arise a chance for him to use it.\n’How many points do I have now?’\n[Ding!]\n[Total Points: 3201]\nThat put a smile on his face.\nAustin stretched his arms before muttering,\n’I should get out,’\n°°°°°°°\nThe next day, early morning, Austin and Valerie were running side by side.\nIt has become a habit to exercise and train together.\nNot only both of them were adamant about remaining in shape, but their greed to see each other as soon as the day breaks never allowed them to miss a single day of exercise.\nValerie was wearing a black jogging track, that consisted of jogging trousers, a white shirt with a jacket. She has tied her hair in a high ponytail that allows her to move freely.\nAustin had a similar outfit, but he only wore a white shirt on his upper body.\nTheir forehead was glimmering with sweat.\nAustin noticed that from wherever they passed, people glanced at them, and whispering among themselves.\n’Seriously, how gossipy they can be...’ He ignored those gazes but Valerie didn’t.\nHowever, to not bother her Lord, she didn’t say anything and continued to run in silence.\n\"Wanna take a break?\" Austin asked and got a nod in response.\nThey both paused before a resting bench and Valerie instantly pulled a towel she had tugged at her waist.\n\"Thank you,\" Austin faintly whispered in between his labored breathing.\nValerie asked, \"Want me to bring some water?\"\n\"No, it’s fine. We will go to the common hall anyway.\"\nValerie wanted to bring some water, considering how much he had sweated. But she didn’t insist and sat down beside him.\nThe temperature was really nice today—perfect for exercising.\nThey have to report to the team meeting in an hour and start their team training.\nThe second-day match would start in five hours, so they would get enough time to train.\nTomorrow, they would be performing in the arena.\nTomorrow, it would be decided if Valorian would survive in the tournament or not.\nMany things were on the line tomorrow, and Austin didn’t want a single thing to go against their way.\n\"I know we will win our match.\" As if she read his mind, Valerie rested her hand on his and assured him.\n\"I mean, we have you so surely-\"\n\"No, Austin...we both know that this match cannot be won by a single person. Without you or the other two, it would be quite difficult.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Are you putting pressure on me?\"\nValerie blinked before her lips extended in a soft smile as she said, \"Did I pressurize you? Well, I can compensate you by rewarding you if we win.\"\nAustin was very curious, so he asked right away, \"What is the reward this time?\"\nValerie’s cheeks were flushed red, as she bit her lip.\nAustin was both excited and patient to hear her answer, so he chose to give her the time she needed to muster up her strength.\nHowever, the moment Valerie decided to tell him,\n\"AHHHHHHH!\"\nA cry arrived from the student’s dorm wing.\nAustin and Valerie instantly got up on their feet.\nMany students began to rush toward the dorm\nAustin and Valerie shared a glance before they also sped towards the source of the cry.\nThe students started to gather around the gallery that led to Valorian’s dorm.\nAustin had a bad feeling about this as he held Valerie’s hand and weaved through the crowd.\nThe partition in the crowd was found near the room where Valerie was staying with Annabelle.\nAustin’s heart nearly stopped as he peeked inside the room and found a certain boy lying there—his limbs separated and the person encased in an ice block.\nAnd it wasn’t just any boy...rather, the one who humiliated him yesterday.\nAustin turned to look at Valerie.\nAnd her expression told him everything.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Jasmine was exasperated.\nShe clearly told the bastard named Zevarath to only ambush when the Valorian academy would be performing on their match day.\nHowever, that dumb skull couldn’t wait and ended up committing this small drama.\n’But still...it’s staged quite well...’ The black-haired girl couldn’t stop herself from smiling as she saw the dead guy lying inside a block of ice.\nShe was aware of the altercation he had with Austin last night in the common hall.\nAnd following that, he was found dead in the room of that girl who worships Austin.\nJasmine saw Austin looking at Valerie with a frown, while Valerie shook her head with her eyes full of tears.\nSeeing a strong person shedding tears is such a joy to her heart.\nThe whispers of the students were quite helpful as well.\n\"Isn’t that the same guy from last night?\"\n\"I heard the S-rank was quite crazy, but this...isn’t that a crime?\"\n\"Of course, it is! Killing a student regardless of their background is forbidden and should be punished!\"\n\"It’s all because of that loser...now Valorian lost their best student.\"\n\"Can you all stop?!\" Suddenly, the booming voice of a certain male silenced everyone.\nAustin’s aura clearly said that he was frustrated, as he looked at the others.\nJasmine frowned...wasn’t he suspecting Valerie? Or was it an act? Or is this an act?\n\"It hasn’t been proven who killed him and yet you all are talking rubbish at her face. Quite the mature people you all are.\" He didn’t hesitate in insulting the people from seven different nations, of which several of them were royalty.\nValerie’s change of expression irritated Jasmine. She clicked her tongue and swirled her finger before providing a command to one of her pets.\nA black-haired boy stepped forward before accusing, \"He was found dead in her room just a few hours later he humiliated you! And we all know how close you two are...it would take a fool to not connect the dots.\"\nAnother twirl of a finger, and another pet barked, \"She clearly seemed on the verge of murdering him yesterday. And if not for the maid who came for room cleaning, no one would have known where the boy disappeared to.\"\n\"She clearly slaughtered him and tried to hide it!\"\n\"Just being strong doesn’t mean you are above the law!\"\nThe audience was growing noisy and Jasmine had a satisfied smile on her face.\n’Come on, Luke. I know you love that girl...now, show us how will you defend your oh-so-perfect girl.’\nAustin took a step toward Valerie and stood before her; shielding her.\nHis stance made it clear that he wouldn’t let anything reach his woman.\nCrossing his arms, he said, \"Assume whatever the fuck you want, but another word you speak against her, I swear you would be the next dead body lying here.\"\nThat statement held no warning but pure certainty.\nThe aura he wore around his body was not something a mere D-rank should possess.\nA killing intent that far surpassed a student who should have only gained experience in a controlled environment.\nIn their eyes, Austin appeared as an untamed beast who would swallow any curse thrown at his woman and the one who spits it.\n\"What is happening here?\" Soon, the soldiers of the Council arrived, and so did the Headmaster of the Valorian.\nTheir reaction was almost similar. Some gasped and some just were astonished.\nJasmine thought that they would take some time to investigate the matter, but,\n\"Soldiers, arrest her!\" One of them was the management chief, who ordered the soldiers while directing his gaze toward Valerie.\n\"Hey, wait! How can you jump to the conclusion so soon?!\" Austin stopped them from advancing and seemed to be on the verge of summoning his Shard.\nEven the Headmaster protested, \"At least, first assess the situation, Eden.\"\nThe management chief, Eden, had a firm stance when he said, \"All the visual reports indicate that she has done it. But right now, I am not arresting her to put her in a cell or anything. She would be taken to the Headquarters for interrogation, and if she is proven innocent there, no one will question her any further.\"\nPhilius frowned, as he turned to look at the dead body on the ground.\nThere was no argument that Valerie was a prime suspect in this crime.\nNo one was unaware of the possessiveness she carried for Austin, and in a fit of rage, Philius saw how far she could go.\nExhaling a sigh, he advanced toward Austin before resting his hand on his shoulder and telling the younger one, \"Look, Austin, I know Valerie couldn’t take such a massive step...but right now, everything is speaking against her. So let her go and prove her innocence.\"\nAustin gritted his teeth, \"Just because he was found in her room....they all are assuming she did it.\"\n\"Isn’t that oddly familiar?\" Someone voiced, making every eye turn towards him.\nIt was the same boy who had gotten quite close to Rhea recently: Esner.\n\"I heard the Prince of our nation was accused of the same crime? That he kidnapped you and you were found in his room. No one listened to him and blamed the Prince...or so what I heard? So why the change of mind here? Was it written on Prince Parkinson’s face that he was a criminal? Or was it prejudice on your part, Headmaster Philius?\"\nHearing the boy’s query the students went abuzz.\nThose who didn’t know the situation that caused Parkinson’s disappearance were now whispering about whether Valorian discriminates against students from foreign lands.\nPhilius knew that things were not going their way, and if it continued, things wouldn’t settle just with Valerie.\nThe older one’s grip turned firm around Austin’s shoulder, which left the blond one with no option.\nHe turned towards Valerie and cupped her cheek, \"Val...I am ashamed to say but I cannot stop you from getting taken away.\"\nValerie’s tears were still visible but she wasn’t crying...rather, there was a smile on her face when she said, \"I am not afraid...until you believe in me, I fear nothing.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh before he kissed the crown of her head and whispered something.\nSoon the soldiers stepped forward and ushered to get moving.\nUnder the crime of murdering a student, Valerie Corwon was arrested.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- And now, she would become a true Villainess—kidding.",

      "content": "Zevarath was a General under the command of the Orc Lord, a figure feared across battlefields drenched in blood.\nWith the disappearance of the four demon generals and the Demon King, he was hailed as the King of the demonic monsters, one of the highest authorities left in the dark ranks.\nHis role was not simply to maintain order—it was to expand. To ensure that when the Demon Lord rose once more, he would awaken to an army vast and powerful enough to crush all opposition.\nAnd for that, Zevarath had set his sights on the most malleable of recruits—children. Young minds, easy to bribe, easy to manipulate.\nHis task was simple: secure a handful of exceptional young talents, the kind that would be found in this very competition. After all, only the strong made it this far.\nUnder normal circumstances, such a plan might have been met with fierce resistance. But Zevarath had orchestrated distractions. The Union Council was already overwhelmed, dealing with demonic incursions on multiple shores—a crisis of his own design.\nHad the Union Council interfered, matters would have turned problematic. Their Pillars—warriors of immense power—would have been formidable adversaries, even for him.\nWhich was why he had taken no risks. He divided his forces, sending them in separate directions, keeping the Council stretched thin and engaged elsewhere.\nWith their eyes turned away, the perfect opportunity had presented itself.\n’Now, come to me.’ The demon general had a grin on his face as he levitated in the sky with his arms crossed.\nBeneath him was a barrier that was barely visible even to him, even though it was his slaves who chanted it.\nThe carriage in which his target rested has left the venue.\nJust a few minutes and he would get the prized human he has taken so much risk for.\nEver since that day when he fought her, Zevarath had only one thought in his head—what was she doing among humans?\nShe is strong but has a lot of potential in store. Those few minutes, they didn’t fight but conversed through their weapon.\nFrom that conversation, Zevarath got to know that the woman was wasting her talent by being with these weak ducklings.\nShe can achieve so much more than she possibly couldn’t imagine.\nAnd for that, he would take her away. She would not thrive while being with those people, especially not that weakling of a fiancé.\n[She left. Can you see her?]\nHearing Jasmine’s voice in his ear, Zevarath responded soon,\n\"Yes, I can see her. Is someone following the carriage?\"\nIt would be a hassle and annoying if someone were to trace her. Although this barrier would be hefty for any strong warrior, Zevarath didn’t want any disturbance in his hunting today.\n[No, not that I can see. Even Austin is just walking on the front lawn but shows no sign of following the carriage.]\nZevarath didn’t want to hear about that joke of a man. Although he defeated Stain’s commander, he could never reach the level where he and Valerie would stand one day.\n\"Keep an eye on everything. I won’t take it long.\"\n[You better not. And start with the chaos in the arena already!]\nShe barked in his ear, which made him irritated. However, considering it was required to keep the authority busy and the Union Council away from Zevarath, he followed Jasmine’s words.\nCommanding his soldiers mentally, he told them to begin throwing the whole venue into chaos.\n\"Now, Valerie, no one can come between us.\"\n....\nValerie frowned, as suddenly, she felt something weird coursing through her body.\nIt was an unfamiliar sensation...as if her body was turning sluggish.\nShe raised her eyes and looked at others with a frown, \"Where are you taking me...\" There was no chance they were headed to the headquarters. She has visited it recently and knew it wasn’t the route.\nThe soldiers inside the carriage took out their knives before warning her, \"Now, stay calm; otherwise, it is going to hurt.\"\nValerie’s eyes darkened as she summoned her Shard, and instantly, the soldier beside her attacked her—\n\"Hey, you-\" However, his words faded since his throat and every part of his body were frozen under thick ice.\nThe other soldier’s eyes widened as he shoved the knife toward Valerie’s face, \"Damn you!\"\nValerie tilted her and held his wrist.\n*CRACK*\nA snap it all took before a sharp cry echoed throughout the carriage.\nValerie summoned an ice shard before stabbing the man, in the middle of his head—fast and precise, ceasing his movement as his mind froze.\nValerie was breathing roughly as she looked around.\nThe carriage had stopped, but she could barely muster up her strength to dash out.\nThis sensation was extremely overpowering. As if her own body has become the biggest burden to the girl.\nHer face was pale as she pushed herself up and jumped out of the carriage—\n\"Agh...\"\n—only for her ankle to twist. Her body failed to respond and her bones seemed to have turned fragile.\nNot only that, she could barely retain the form of her Shard. Her soul was not responding to her command. This was the first time she had experienced something like this.\n\"It took me over ten days...to form this barrier.\"\nA voice echoed before Valerie raised her eyes and her Shard in the enemy’s direction.\nThe red-skinned demon she fought at the shore of Drenovar slowly descended to the surface, with his hands locked behind his back and a confident smile on his face.\nValerie had a cautious stance, even though she deep down knew that unless she converged all her strength in the running away, she would not survive in front of this entity today.\n\"I have been planning for this day, for so long...and finally, you are here. Tell me, Valerie, do you like my dedication.\"\n\"You are not worthy to call me by my name...so shut up and fight.\" Her tone still held the edge of that day.\nAnd that’s what makes her so interesting in his eyes. This was the first time he had met a human with such a burning fighting spirit.\n\"You are weakened, Valerie, and my soldiers have completely surrounded this barrier. So neither you can run away nor anyone can come to save you.\"\nValerie growled, \"Who is running away?\" Those words were fueled with blood lust as she tapped her spear butt on the floor before several ice lances formed behind her.\nValerie pushed her arm forward before the ice spikes flew in an inhumane way.\nZevarath sighed as he moved minimally yet dodged each lance easily.\nValerie wasn’t done there. She moved her hand, and those ice lances slowly stopped before twisting in the air.\nShe gritted her teeth in frustration—normally, she wouldn’t have felt so much trouble in spell manipulation\nZevarath didn’t even turn to look at the lances and whipped his tail, to destroy each one of them into small fragments.\n*CLANG* *CLANG*\nValerie took several deep breaths, her vision blurring and her mind protesting her from keeping awake.\nShe fought the sensation and raised her spear.\nA huge crystal formed above the demon, of the size of a huge tree.\nShe didn’t think twice before releasing the hold of her spell and letting the crystal fall on top of the demon.\n**BOOOOOM**\nTaking advantage of the inhumane’s nonchalance, she turned around and began to run\nHer body was throbbing and her heart was audible in her ears.\nShe did her best to dash into the forest...if only she could get away from this barrier...\n\"Ah!\" Valerie exclaimed as she bumped into something and fell down.\n\"As I said, my dear, there is no running away from me anymore. You have to submit it today.\" Zevarath, who had appeared out of nowhere, lowered himself to her face level.\nThis barrier was made in a way that the stronger one’s Soul energy was, the weaker they would get. That explains her current condition.\n\"Now, stop resisting.\"\nHowever, just as he held Valerie’s hand and pulled her up—\n**RUMBLE**\nThe ground shook. The connection with his soldiers, who were protecting the barrier, started to get cut off. A strong presence approached Zevarath from behind...a presence he couldn’t ignore.\nIt was then, Jasmine’s voice echoed in his ears,\n[It was Austin’s clone! He has gone after you!]\nZevarath didn’t have to hear it from Jasmine to know.\nThe Demon could see him\nThe same weakling he thought was beneath consideration as a potential threat.\nHowever, right now, Zevarath could tell that the boy had gotten stronger....much stronger than before.\n\"What do we have here—\" Zevarath wanted to start with a formal greeting, but suddenly—an arrow pierced through his chest.\n\"Huh?\" Zevarath tilted his head as he looked at the arrow and found his body turning black for some reason.\nThe hand that was holding Valerie crumbled into dust, and soon his legs gave out, too.\nAustin approached the demon before picking up an unconscious Valerie in his arms.\nLooking at the fading demon before him, Austin relayed, \"You shouldn’t have touched her.\"\nThe last thing Zevarath saw before his ultimate demise was a pair of hollow eyes that held no emotions.\n\"You...aren’t a human, are you?\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Damn...Austin used it without another thought. He touched Valerie after all.",

Austin was not surprised. He expected Zevarath to corner Valerie to take her down.\nHe followed the general direction where the carriage was headed…however, the forest was too vast and it would be a disaster if the Demon General reached Valerie all alone.\nShe was strong, yes; however, not only does Zevarath have a huge demonic army, but he is an S-rank entity himself.\n'Where they could have gone…' His feet slowly came to a halt as he realized he was reaching nowhere.\nAlthough they left only a few minutes before Austin made an exit, the carriage seemed to have just vanished out of nowhere.\nAustin kept searching left and right and climbed the tallest tree in the vicinity to search for her, however, it was fruitless.\n'Where are you Valerie…' There was no sound of battle or magic nearby which was making him bothered.\nTwo S-ranks colliding should release enough battle cry for him to detect her location.\nBut at the moment, it seems he was standing in a graveyard…too eerily silent.\nIt was then,\n*CLINK*\nHis ring gave a slight jolt to his finger before Austin raised it to his eye level.\nThe middle section of the ring parted and a small golden light orb rose from the ring.\nAustin's eyes widened—he completely forgot about this artifact—and if it got activated then it meant,\n'Valerie is in trouble…' As absurd as it sounds, that is the truth.\nAustin followed the light orb. Thankfully, the faster he got, the light orb matched his pace.\n\"Huh?\" Suddenly, he felt something heavy descending on his shoulder and the sky darkened for some reason.\nHowever, he didn't have the time to assess the situation as he saw a horde of monsters advancing in his direction.\nAustin looked at the light orb and found out that it was getting brighter—meaning, her condition was worsening.\nAustin gritted his teeth and hurled himself into the air.\nBlinding light erupted as he summoned Raijin, lightning surging around him like a raging storm. The demonic beasts hesitated, their snarls turning to wary growls.\nAustin swung his axe high, his voice shaking the battlefield.\n\"STAY OUT OF MY WAY!\"\nCRACKLE!\nBOOOOOOOM!\nThe axe struck down, and a torrent of lightning ripped through the nearest beast. The current exploded outward, leaping from one monster to the next. Flesh burned, bones snapped, and in an instant, a dozen creatures were reduced to smoking husks.\nAustin made his way through the horde, burning anything that landed in his sight.\nHe was a furious being, his attention completely converged at reaching his beloved.\n*SCREECH*\nHe didn't have to move much further before he came across two figures.\nAustin was prepared for a battle to at least weaken the Demon…however, the moment he saw the Demon holding Valerie's hand…Austin's head turned blank.\nHis eyes were parted wide and his body completely stiff.\n'Touched her…touched her….my Val…how….why….how can he…she is mine…he shouldn't have…why….why….WHY DID HE TOUCH HER?!'\nWithout him realizing Austin had summoned the Death Vow in his hand, pulled its string and a name left his lips,\n'Zevarath…'\n\"What do we have here-\" The demon General turned to look at him, while still holding his Valerie.\nHowever, he couldn't finish his words as the flaming arrow pierced through his chest, and slowly, his body began to crumble.\nAustin advanced toward them before picking Valerie in his arms.\nLooking at the creature with immense anger still visible in his eyes, Austin said, \"You shouldn't have touched her.\"\nZevarath had his eyes widened as he muttered, \"You…aren't a human, are you?\"\nAustin didn't stay there to listen to the nonsense before he walked away with Valerie in his arms.\nShe looked feverish, but in his arms, she wasn't frowning anymore. She subconsciously snuggled closely in his arms and mumbled something inaudible.\nAustin had a serene smile on his face as he manipulated his Shard and Wisp to take down any demon that approached them.\nIt was a scene out of a fairy tale—the Prince came to take his beloved from the evil being.\nAnd now, he was taking her back.\n------*------\n\"Huh?!\" Austin was shocked to see the situation at the venue.\nThe tournament grounds were in ruins. Screams and roars clashed, echoing through the air. Smoke curled from burning stands, and the stench of blood was thick.\nStudents ran in every direction—some clutching wounds, others dragging fallen friends. Some didn't move at all, their lifeless bodies scattered across the battlefield.\nWyverns swooped down, their wings kicking up debris as their claws tore through anything in their path. Demonic beasts rampaged, crushing bones beneath their massive limbs. Snarling monsters lunged at terrified students, fangs sinking into flesh.\nSwords clashed. Spells crackled. Blood sprayed. The ground was littered with broken weapons, shattered armor, and bodies—human and monster alike.\nThe once-proud arena was now a slaughterhouse.\n\"Your Highness!\" Just as Austin was thinking of bringing Valerie to safety and fighting the monsters, someone came rushing in their way and addressed Austin.\n\"Aren't you the head maid? Why are you here?\" Austin recognized the woman. She was the head maid and someone who served the queen…but why was she here?\n\"Your Highness, the carriage in which your parents were traveling to the venue is attacked. All the soldiers are dead and only Sebastian is keeping them safe.\" The lady spoke in between her labored breathing. Looking closely, there was a severe injury on her forehead, too.\nAustin gritted his teeth…how many are there actually?\nHe was contemplating where he should bring Valerie so she could remain safe when suddenly he found a demonic wolf heading in their direction.\n\"SHIT!\" Austin summoned his Shard, ready to fight the monster…but the pace of the monster slowly slowed down, and ice began to creep its way from its paws to its head.\nAustin blinked in surprise before he looked down at his beloved.\nShe was looking up at him with a soft smile before she moved her face and kissed the corner of his lips, \"Go protect them…I will handle things here.\"\nAustin parted his mouth to say something but then he just nodded and kissed her forehead, \"Stay safe.\"\n--------**--------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Sebastian doesn't know why, but the place that was supposed to be the most secure venue on the human side was under attack.\nHe was one of the soldiers escorting the two royalties to the venue so they could meet their son and witness him in his glorious moments.\nSebastian was pretty much excited, which was quite unnatural for him, to bring them to the venue.\nDespite whatever had happened until now the man still hoped this family wouldn't break—that explains his excitement.\nHowever, en route, they were attacked by several demons one after another. They weren't demonic humans whom he fought back in Drenovar. Rather, they all were pure-blood demons from the other side.\n*SQUELCH*\nHe swung his dagger and slit the throat of the goblin that lunged at his back.\n**BOOOOM**\nDucking under the fireball, he threw several throwables in the mage's direction, which exploded upon contact.\n'There is no end to this...' Sebastian was quite anxious at the moment. All the soldiers have died and inside the carriages were the two most important individuals of Eryndor.\nHe had no idea why the Union Council hadn't sent any reinforcement. And if this continues, Sebastian has a bleak hope they will survive today.\nAlthough the King is a strong warrior, his current condition would prevent him from fighting for long.\nSebastian barely caught his breath. The bodies of demons piled up around him, their blood staining his armor. He was panting, his vision shaking, but there was no time to stop.\nA screech tore through the battlefield. A massive demon, its skin like a cracked stone, charged at him.\nSebastian twisted his body, dodging the first swing of its jagged blade, but the second came too fast—SLASH!\nPain exploded in his side. His armor cracked, blood spilling down his waist. He stumbled back, but before the demon could strike again, he lunged forward, driving his dagger into its eye.\nThe creature howled. Sebastian twisted the blade and yanked it out. Black blood splattered across his face. He shoved the dying demon aside and turned—\nA spear shot toward him. He barely managed to deflect it, but the force sent him crashing to the ground. His ears rang. His body screamed.\nSuddenly a blade zapped toward him.\nSebastian's eyes widened. His heartbeat reached the limit.\nJust when the blade was inches away from penetrating his skull,\n*Shling*\nA sword intercepted the projectile.\nA sword well too familiar to him.\n\"*Gruooh*\" The orc howled as the man jumped forward and plunged the blade inside its massive head before hanging with the blade, he split apart the monster from the middle.\nCedric cleaved those monsters that ran towards them, before he stabbed his sword in the ground, before a stone wall erected around them.\nExtending his hand toward the fallen butler, the King said, \"There is no end to them.\"\nSebastian took his hand, and while groaning a little, he got up.\nThe barrier was already breaking and in the distance, Sebastian could see that demonic wyverns were advancing in their direction. And once they are here...not any barrier would be able to stop them.\nBoth men knew that this was a losing war. However, neither of them was ready to give up until their last breath.\nInside the carriage, Sophie clasped her hand. All she could feel right now was anxiety as she kept praying for help to arrive.\n'Please...anyone....'\n\"Here they come!\" Cedric voiced as he held his sword with both hands, as he saw the wyvern opening its maw—flames gathering at the opening.\nSebastian was ready to push away the King and put himself before the man he had sworn to protect—but then,\n**CRACKLE**\nA figure appeared above the wyvern.\nSebastian's eyes widened.\nThat person was familiar.\nHe lunged into the air, tightly holding his weapon.\n\"Young master....\" Those words were followed by a massive explosion.\n**BOOOOOOOOOM**\nHis mace, a mountain of steel in his hands, came down like judgment itself. It caved through the wyvern's skull in an instant, splitting it open down to the neck. Bone exploded. Brains and blood burst outward in a thick, steaming spray.\nThe sheer force drove the wyvern straight into the ground. The air howled as its massive body plummeted like a meteor, its bones shattering on impact.\nFlesh ripped apart as the ground caved beneath it, leaving a crater filled with crushed organs and splintered remains.\nThe rock barrier shattered as Cedric saw his son on top of the dead wyvern, his mace still plunged inside the dead demon's head.\nAustin glanced at the duo, before throwing something at Sebastian, \"Drink it and relax.\"\nSebastian caught the vial and was about to offer assistance—\n*Crackle*\n—only to find Austin disappearing.\nLightning tore the sky apart as Austin vanished.\nHe reappeared amid the enemy ranks, Raijin crashing down. A thunderclap shook the battlefield, and in an instant, dozens exploded—bodies ripped apart, bones shattered, flesh burned black.\nBefore the smoke cleared, Ashen Maul was already swinging. It slammed into the ground, and a wave of scorching embers erupted outward. Armor melted. Skin charred. Screams filled the air before being swallowed by the roaring inferno.\nA spear shot toward him.\nAustin tilted his head.\nHis Shard grew in an instant, slicing through the weapon, the wielder, and three more behind him. He twisted, flicking the blood off as the dagger shrunk back.\nAn army of hundreds stood before him.\nAustin stepped forward.\nRaijin flashed. Thunder roared.\nThe slaughter began.\nA massive warrior lunged, blade raised.\nAustin vanished—then reappeared above him.\nAshen Maul crashed down. The warrior collapsed like a crushed insect, his armor melting into his flesh as flames devoured him from the inside out. The ground beneath him caved, charred black, leaving only a smoking crater.\nArrows rained from above.\nAustin flicked his wrist.\nHis Shard expanded mid-air, spinning like a bladed storm. Every arrow shattered. Every archer fell in pieces. He caught the dagger mid-spin, barely glancing at the corpses before moving again.\nSeeing his son weaving through the forces, Cedric had his eyes parted wide. He could barely trace Austin with his eyes and those three weapons he handled with such brilliance.\n\"Sebastian...is he really Austin?\" Cedric couldn't help but ask.\nSophie was shocked beyond belief as well, as she saw the scene beyond comprehension.\nThe same child who had a hard time killing his first demonic beast two years ago...was slaughtering these demons as if they were nothing but ripen crops ready to be cultivated.\nWhenever Austin went, destruction descended.\nThe monsters were no longer focused on the carriage but on the human that was restlessly moving through the battlefield and decreasing the numbers at an inhumane pace.\n**BOOOOM**\nAustin ducked under the flame ball before he turned towards the mage who had been hiding behind its comrades until now.\n\"Let me handle him-\" Cedric offered help, thinking that his son was too far from the mage.\nHowever, \"It's okay,\" As Austin said, he brought his raised hand down, and instantly something zipped down the air before an explosion occurred\n**BOOOOOM**\nEvery being near the target was damaged by the boomerang that came crashing down at a pace that was impossible to dodge\nAnd the mage at which it was directed...well, one might find the evidence of its presence if they collected its splattered innards and blood.\n\"*GRUOOOOOH*\" Suddenly a loud roar echoed, sending a shiver down Sophie's spine as she got out of the carriage.\n\"Austin!\" She shouted as she saw the ten-foot-tall golem a few meters away from him.\nAustin was genuinely surprised to hear that voice...and the concern laced in her tone\nHowever, nothing stopped him from lunging at the monster.\nIndex finger tightly pressed against the thumb.\nAustin appeared before the Golem in a heartbeat, jumped in the air, and then\n**FLICK**\nA single flick it all took before the golem's face exploded.\nThe strength behind that flick was powered by the strength of [Retaliation]\nEven Sebastian couldn't hide his shock this time.\n...that monster was at least C-rank...\nCedric and Sebastian's mouths were parted while Sophie covered her mouth in pure astonishment.\nSeeing their in-field commander exploding into nothingness, the other demons started to feel it.\nA very primal feeling that every being is born with.\nFear.\n*CLANG*\n*Dhak*\nTheir weapons dropped, and their body shook.\nAustin's cold eyes turned towards the horde, and instantly, the demonic beast jumped away and began to run.\nAustin sighed seeing them rushing away from the battlefield.\n'Seriously...I thought they were driven by their goal...turned out, they are just like humans.' Austin thought as he summoned all his weapons back to him and stored them in the 'Inventory'.\nJust as he squatted to pick up his beloved boomerang, he heard a very familiar and feminine voice,\n\"A-Austin..\" He didn't need to turn to know who called him. For fifteen years, he has heard this voice daily.\nAustin didn't turn towards them before saying, \"Follow me. I will take you to safety.\"\nSophie's raised hand lost its strength as she lowered her head.\nSoon her husband came to her side and held her shoulder.\nShe looked at him before Cedric gave a soft nod to her.\nThe trio soon began to follow the blond Prince.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"Sir Austin, are these the comrades of the same demon who attacked back in Drenovar?\"\nHearing the question from the butler, Austin was surprised, as he asked, \"How did you know?\"\n\"The amount of Demonic Beast was more that day as well, just like today.\" Sebastian made a wild guess.\nAustin was impressed, as he said, \"You are right. It was the same Demon. Well, the Demon General is dead so we just need to take down the remaining troops.\" With his tone dimming a little, he added, \"Hopefully, without a leader, they must have turned disarray.\"\nSebastian asked, \"Did Lady Valerie put down the General?\"\nAustin thought for a moment, before nodding, \"Yeah.\" There was no point in saying something here that could even turn the most faithful, suspicious towards you.\nNeither of them was unaware that the Demon General was an S-rank and someone who held years of experience. Even Valerie was having a hard time dealing with him the last time they fought.\nAnd it was a fact that a battle head-on with that demon without any assistance would have been impossibly difficult. Despite his advancement to B-rank, the difference was still quite profound.\nSo in a way, Austin did the best thing in that situation by shooting him down.\n\"Why aren't you taking that potion?\" Now that Austin noticed it, the butler hadn't taken the potion until now.\n\"It looks expensive and wasting it on someone like-\"\n\"Again, with you belittling yourself. I already told you that you are my family member, Sebas. So stop thinking and gulp it down.\"\nThose words made Sebastian stunned for a moment, and if not for the emergency, he might have frozen at his place.\nThe man behind the two, the King of Eryndor, smiled warmly upon hearing those words.\nHe glanced at his wife and found the edges of her lips slightly arched as well.\n'Despite our negligence, you have grown up as a fine young man,' Cedric felt his chest swelling in pride.\nSoon, the four of them reached the venue.\nAustin wasn't surprised to see that the number of demonic beasts had dropped significantly.\nThey just needed someone who could be their pillar of hope. Someone who can lead them.\nAnd looking at those huge ice glaciers, and hundreds of frozen bodies, Austin knew his woman became their hope.\n\"Sebastian, wait here with them. I will go and check on others.\"\nSebastian nodded and before Cedric could have said something, the blond Prince disappeared.\n\"In the past, I could have easily won a race against him...\" The smiling King voiced.\n....\nInside the venue, things were getting under control.\nAustin came across several demonic humans who were killed or frozen.\nIt was apparent that Austin failed to realize when Zevarath penetrated the defenses and started influencing students.\nThe number of Demonic beasts he found dead was simply overwhelming. The horde he fought previously was like ten percent of this.\n\"Rudolph!\" Austin shouted as he found the familiar black-haired guy huffing while standing over a dead wyvern.\nHis armour did nothing to protect or even cover his upper body and the boy seemed wounded from several spots.\nRudolph jumped from the beast before landing before him, \"It's chaotic.\" He said. And when someone as chaos-loving as Rudolph seemed so tired and stressed, then that means that the situation was indeed quite overwhelming.\nAustin patted his soldier, \"But we survived.\"\nRudolph heaved a sigh, \"Yeah...but not everyone was lucky.\" As he said, he looked at those students who fought rather than trying to run away but, unfortunately, couldn't survive.\nAustin also felt sorrow seeing those many young ones meeting unfortunate and premature ends.\n\"Austin!\" Suddenly, Rhea came rushing in their way, her face smeared with tears.\n\"What happened?\" Austin asked as he held her arm, and stopped the girl before she could tripped with the momentum.\n\"President...she....please come with me.\"\nThe duo didn't delay a moment before dashing in the direction she led them.\nThankfully, all the monsters were dead, or they fled; otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to reach their destination this quickly.\n\"Shit...\" Austin muttered, uncharacteristically cursing despite his noble background as he took in the scene.\nRudolph's eyes widened, too, as they saw a gaping hole open in the President's stomach, and her belly completely caved in.\nHer face was pale and the person was evidently in a bad condition.\n\"Please stay with me...\" Sheldon, who usually retains his calm demeanor, sobbed as he held his lover's hand.\nAny potion, any bandage they applied...nothing worked. It was impossible to save her now.\nThe demon that attacked her, injected a lethal poison and tore a huge chunk of her body.\nIf not for her status as an Awakened she would have died long ago.\nAustin could feel her fading soul energy.\nEvery person has a tense expression on their face.\nAustin looked at Valerie and found a frown of concern on her face.\n...how can he forget that in the whole academy, the only friend Valerie made and someone who understands Valerie despite the latter's conservative nature, is the president.\nAustin heaved a sigh, before telling them, \"Form a ring around me and block me from plain sight.\" As he said he approached the President and knelt beside her.\nSheldon looked at the blond Prince, a very faint and flickering spark of hope ignited within him.\nThe others glanced at each other, unsure what this was about, when suddenly, Valerie commanded, \"Just do what he says!\"\nThey stiffened and instantly formed a ring.\nAustin looked at Sheldon, who was still unmoving, before he said, \"Trust me, Vice-president, I will save her.\"\nThe silver haired took a deep breath and gave a firm nod before he also stood up and covered Austin.\nThe blond Prince acted to insert his hand inside his jacket before he pulled out a vial from his [Inventory] which was filled with red potion.\n\"We tried every grade of pot-\" Elara, who was about to roll her eyes at the fruitless attempt, stiffened when she felt killing intent from across her.\nShe took a strong gulp and decided to remain silent.\nAustin took a deep breath and uncapped the vial before tilting Annabelle's head slightly.\n\"Drink this, prez.\" He faintly whispered before he began to pour the content into her mouth.\nIt was the same elixir he used to save the former king of Drenovar.\nHe still had five, so he decided to use it to save his wife's friend.\nNothing was allowed to make his Valerie sad.\nAnnabelle had enough strength to only move her throat and intake the potion.\nJust as the first gulp passed down, the wound on her belly glowed with bright red illumination.\nThe darkness from her veins slowly receded and her complexion slowly improved.\nBefore everyone's eyes, Austin pulled a miracle that day.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "The Union Council finally sent reinforcements to handle the situation at the venue.\nThose students who were critically damaged were taken to medication. And those who died...well, their families are getting contacted.\nFor the time being, they have arranged refugee camps outside the venue which was heavily guarded by the Council soldiers.\nNo one has come to take responsibility for this whole situation, nor anyone showed up to apologize.\nHundreds of families would weep today after seeing their child lying in a coffin.\nThey could have never imagined that a tournament arranged by the strongest organization would take their child away from them.\nNobles were coming from different nations, that's why special tents were arranged for them to stay. And a high-ranking officer was continuously guarding their temporary residence.\nFood and other necessary supplies were provided, and transportation was arranged to take the students and their parents back.\nStudents were provided with much smaller tents but had enough space to fit at least seven people.\nInside one of such tents, there were a few familiar faces that could be seen.\nAustin was standing beside Rudolph as they leisurely discussed the battle they faced.\nAnnabelle was resting in the tent as well, with Rhea beside using a wet cloth to cool down her burning head.\nIt wasn't anything serious but overuse of Soul Energy has caused commonly known backlash. With proper treatment and diet, she would recover in a few days.\nElara and Ryan were in different tents, with their friends. And Valerie was also not present currently.\nSheldon brought Annabelle's hand to his lips before kissing it softly, as he asked, \"How do you feel now?\"\nIt might be the seventh time in an hour that he asked that.\nAnnabelle couldn't stop her lips from curving in a smile as she assured him, \"I feel good now...just feeling weak slight which will go away.\"\nSheldon heaved a sigh before he got up and faced Austin.\nThe blond noble also turned in his direction, before he heard the Vice-President saying, \"I cannot thank you enough for what you have done, Austin. I promise, any time in your life, you need my help, I will do whatever I can.\"\nAustin smilingly shook his head, \"Truth be told I saved her because her death would have pained me immensely.\"\nThat response made everyone surprised, as the pinkhead asked, \"Why...is that Austin?\"\nAustin's eyes turned solemn with his lips still stretched in a smile as he said, \"Her death would have made Valerie sad...and it's extremely painful for me to see her sad.\"\nMany people died before he arrived. Many people died before his eyes today. Austin knew a lot of those. And just like others, Annabelle was just his acquaintance as well.\nHe wouldn't have saved her using that priceless elixir if only she didn't have a close relationship with Valerie.\nAnnabelle warmly smiled at the junior before she slowly muttered, \"Regardless of the reason, I am thankful that you provided me with another chance. Thank you.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nIn the other tent, four people could be currently seen sitting and one standing.\nThe King and Queen of Eryndor were sitting beside each other on chairs.\nTheir loyal butler, Sebastian, was standing diagonally behind the King with his hands behind his back.\nThe atmosphere was neutral, neither too relaxed nor too tense.\nIt might be the first time after their engagement that these three people have gathered in one place and gained the chance to have a private conversation.\nAnd just like that day, a day before their engagement, the Queen was silent today as well.\n\"I heard what you have done for him. Your support and your encouragement have helped Austin a lot. When we failed as his parents, you remained standing by his side. And for that, I cannot express how grateful I am.\"\nValerie had a keen eye for people when they spoke. She could tell when someone genuinely meant their words and when they were merely saying them out of obligation.\nAnd currently, the King was speaking each word from his heart.\n\"I was just there to support him, but the first step was taken by him.\" She simply responded.\n\"Still, it means a lot. Ah, by the way, I heard you two were summoned to the Council Headquarters recently?\"\nValerie nodded, \"It was for questioning. Austin defeated Hellstain's last soldier, which garnered their attention.\"\nHearing about Drenovar, Sophie bit her lip.\nShe recently got to know what they faced when they were in the ocean-side country.\nSeeing the unease on his wife's face and how eagerly she wanted to ask Valerie about Austin, the blond one said, \"Valerie...I know it's unfair for me to ask this...but can you help mediate the situation between the two?\"\nCedric has already realized the fact that Austin was extremely attached to his fiancée. It can be seen how he brought water and medicine for her, checked on her condition twice, and even pulled a medic just to be on the safe side.\nThat's why, the man asked the girl hopefully.\nValerie's eyes were drawn to the ground, her shoulders slumped.\nIt would be a lie to say she didn't expect it.\nHowever, rather than giving a direct answer, she told them, \"As his fiancée and childhood friend, I realized something peculiarly sweet about him.\"\nWith a soft smile, she added, \"Although he never says it, Austin actually loves having his birthday celebrated. He loves it when people sing for him, cut a cake, and give him presents. Although he never said that, I saw it in his eyes.\"\nTurning her eyes toward the two adults, she asked, \"Naturally, as his parents you must have noticed it too, right? Yet, neither of you even considered bringing him a gift. Forget about that, Your Majesty you didn't even send a letter to him.\"\nSophie's eyes were moist, and her head leaned down. She couldn't refute a single word she said.\nShe has neglected Austin. Her life revolved around Aiden in the few years after he returned.\nDespite receiving so much news about him, she never reacted like a mother. She was just like any passerby who heard the news and gave a few comments before carrying on with her life.\nCedric held his wife's hand in concern, however, right now, he can do only that much. Not all the responsibility fell on her. He was wrong too.\nValerie sighed, \"There was a time when he used to show emotions such as sorrow and anger...but now, he has buried those emotions deep within his heart somewhere and has become numb to any emotion that connects him to his family.\"\nValerie didn't want to say so much to the two, however, she couldn't stop herself.\nThe grief she has seen in his eyes. And the hopelessness he suffered from...she can never forgive these two for that.\nValerie got up from her seat before saying, \"I can only help you gain his forgiveness when you forgive yourself for what you have done, Your Majesty. Excuse me.\"\nLeaving those words, she turned around and left.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Drop a comment.\nAnd also, please check out my new book.",

      "content": "'Someone is looking for you,' Was what the student of Avalon Academy said before dashing away.\nHowever, she could have never guessed that the person asked for Rhea would be, \"Parkinson.\"\nThe only reason she didn't react on impulse and summoned her Shard was because of the presence of so many injured students around who were, naturally, quite traumatized after what happened.\nAnd there were soldiers as well, who would come here instantly and stop Rhea from harming this person.\nParkinson had his head on the floor. However, his apologetic posture didn't faze Rhea as she asked, \"Why are you here? Want to harm Austin again?\"\nParkinson raised his head, \"I swear in the name of my parents I didn't kidnap him!\"\nRhea rolled her eyes, \"Yeah, right. So Austin made someone beat him up and packed himself inside the room, right?\"\nParkinson gulped. If he nodded here, then she would leave immediately. That's why, he said,\n\"I don't blame Austin but there could be someone else, right? Someone who wanted to frame me? Someone who wanted to injure Austin?\"\nRhea had a firm expression, her arms crossed.\nParkinson was relieved that she didn't leave instantly, as he got up and looked at the pinkhead.\n\"Look Rhea, I know you are hurt after seeing those things in my room. But trust me, I meant no harm. It was just my one-sided obsession-\"\n\"Please don't talk about it.\" A displeased expression contoured her face as she stopped him, \"I really don't want to remember that day.\"\nParkinson's shoulders slumped. There was no help in it. He could never justify why he had so many things in his room dedicated to her.\nRhea remained silent for a moment before she said, \"Okay, let's assume that it wasn't you who kidnapped Austin; then what about the proposal your parents sent to exile Austin.\"\nParkinson's eyes widened, as he said, \"I really don't have any clue when they extended that proposal to Eryndor.\"\nRhea had an expression that clearly said that she didn't trust his words.\nParkinson continued, regardless, \"If you want I can even bring my father to confirm that I wasn't involved in all th-\"\n\"Parkinson, listen.\" Rhea stopped him again, and this time, her voice was devoid of any emotion.\nHer pink dead eyes looked down on him, as she said, \"I know what kind of person you are, so whatever I say here won't affect you. You will still chase after me.\"\nWith her eyes narrowing, she added, \"That's why, if you want my forgiveness, then bring me one of the Demon Generals' heads. If you do that, I will forgive you.\"\nParkinson's mouth parted slightly upon hearing that.\nEven the weakest General in the demonic army was at least S-rank. And this was common knowledge.\nAnd for Parkinson who was only A-rank...\n\"I guess you can't so-\"\n\"I will do it!\" With his fist clenched and an unexpected flame of determination burning in his eyes, Parkinson added, \"Until I don't have a Demon General's head in my hand, I won't show my face to you again.\"\nWith those words, Parkinson turned around and walked away.\nRhea really didn't know why she said that. She had no intention of forgiving him, whatsoever. However, she felt if she gave him an impossible task then maybe he would lose all his hope.\n'But I guess this is better ..rather than chasing after me, he can be of better use to humanity.' With those thoughts, Rhea turned around and headed back to the camp.\n°°°°°°°°\nThe soldiers escorted a certain man toward the huge tent where the two most supreme figures of Eryndor were resting.\nThe man was none other than the King of Drenovar and someone who had sworn revenge on Eryndor in the past.\nThose who gazed at the man and recognized him had a fairly shocked expression.\nAlthough the news of the two nations establishing a truce has circulated, it was still not confirmed if Drenovar has forgotten their ages-long revenge.\nFor the first time, the kings of the two nations were united in one place, which wasn't a battlefield.\nThe soldiers guarding the tent had a troubled expression as they stood before the tent entrance.\nIdris raised his left brow seeing their cautious stance, before he asked, \"What's the matter? Can't I meet him right now?\"\nThe soldiers glanced at each other, unsure what they should say.\nThat brief silence was soon broken by the voice of a young man as he said, \"Let him go in. I invited him here.\"\nAustin appeared before them and gave a polite bow to the King, \"I hope you are in good health, Your Majesty.\"\n\"Austin...ahaha!\" The blond Prince was slightly startled having the King hug him all of a sudden. However, out of courtesy, he returned the gesture.\nThe soldiers protecting the tent, seeing the Prince friendly to Drenovar's Supreme Authority, didn't show any caution anymore and stepped away.\n\"Please let's go inside.\" Austin ushered as he gestured towards the tent.\nThe man nodded before he walked beside Austin and stepped inside the temporary residence.\nThe King was already informed about Idris' arrival, that's why he didn't give any surprised reaction and just stood there with a solemn look on his face.\nAustin stopped a few steps before and Idris continued to walk until he was face to face with Cedric.\nSophie, who was behind the curtain looked between the two nervously.\nEven Sebastian was on high alert, just in case.\nThe duration of silence was short as the black-haired man finally voiced, \"It's the first time we are meeting, Cedric.\"\n\"Indeed we are, Idris,\" Cedric responded, mirroring the same tone.\nBecause of the friction between the two nations for two generations, even the yearly meeting arranged by the Union Council, is done in two phase. And in no same summit, does the two countries participate.\nSo, yes, despite being rivals for years, it was the first time they were meeting.\nSuddenly, Idris pressed his hand against his chest, and slightly lowered his head, before saying, \"Before anything, I would like to extend my gratitude to the father who gave birth to such a commendable son. If not for Austin, then I might not have been standing here today.\"\nCedric was visibly taken aback by the behavior. However, his shock didn't delay him in reaching the other royalty and putting his hand on his shoulder, \"Please don't lower your head.\" He added, \"And what you said, then I also feel fortunate to be the father of such an exceptional child.\"\nThe two kings stood face to face, however, there was no animosity but genuine appreciation for the boy who was almost half of their age, yet have achieved so many things.\nAustin was getting a little shy, hearing the two praising him constantly as he shifted on his feet...when suddenly, his hand enveloped in a familiar warmth.\nAustin glanced at Valerie who has a teasing smile on her face as she continued to look at the two Kings.\n\"Val...don't listen...\" He requested. Seriously, it's embarrassing to be praised so much.\nHowever, \"It's the sweetest melody to my ears...to hear my Lord getting praised.\" Winking at him, she added, \"Don't steal me from my happiness, my Lord~\"\n\" ⁠⁄⁠•⁠⁄⁠-⁠⁄⁠•⁠⁄⁠ \"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Don't tease my boy, Val.

      "content": "Idris returned to his tent after a few hours of good chatting with Cedric.\nThey majorly talked about Austin, and despite how much the blond Prince wanted to disappear, a certain someone kept holding his hand until the end.\nSeriously, she was exerting strength in her hold!\nNow, the only ones in the tent were Austin, his parents and Sebastian.\nLord Corwon and his wife arrived just now and were looking for Valerie.\nAustin also wanted to meet them, but Valerie told him to rest for the time being and meet them tomorrow morning.\nAustin also didn't insist since right now, the two of them must be too worried for their daughter to have a conversation with him.\nAustin's clothes were all burned, but fortunately, \"I brought a few pairs of extra night wears, sir.\" Sebastian informed as he took out blue pajamas from his bag.\nCall it instincts or habit, Sebastian packed a few sets of clothes for Austin before coming here.\n\"Thanks, Sebas.\" Austin said as he took the night wear, before saying, \"Then...I will be going.\" Austin has already planned to stay in the same tent as his classmate.\nSebastian's expression changed, a hint of grief appearing in his eyes which didn't go unnoticed by Austin. However, he still turned around and just when he was about to walk,\n\"Won't you stay with us, today?\" A voice that held hope and plea, reached Austin.\nAustin sighed before turning towards the man, \"I...am staying with my friends.\"\nCedric's shoulders slumped, the man appearing older than his age, as he smiled and was about to nod, when suddenly,\n\"I-I will go and stay somewhere else...so please be by your father's side.\" Sophie suddenly got up and suggested.\nShe knew all too well that Austin wasn't staying here because of her. He had always shared a strong bond with his father, and even when Aiden had manipulated their minds, Cedric's care for Austin had never wavered.\nSo the problem here was her.\n\"But Your Majesty where else will you stay?\" Sebastian asked in astonishment. Not only were all the tents already full, the person in question here was the Queen.\nCedric also held a worried gaze and was ready to reject her suggestion, when he heard her saying,\n\"I can just sleep in the carriage. No one will know and-\"\n\"Okay, I am staying. No one need to go anywhere.\" Austin declared followed by an exasperated sigh.\nSeriously, this much drama just for a night?\n°°°°°°°\nValerie was...being hugged. It w the same person who usually hugs her. And the grip around her body was quite firm as well.\nThe lady of the house and Valerie's mother—Corwon Anastasia—was weeping aloud as she embraced her daughter in worry.\n\"As I said, I am fine, mother.\" Valerie assured her as she patted her back.\nHowever, it didn't lessen their worries at all.\nFor some reasons, they got to know from somewhere that Valerie was taken away by the Demon General and was cornered to fight him head on. That explains why they were so horrified.\n\"Mama was so worried!\" The older one cried as she as detached from her daughter and cupped her cheeks, as she asked, \"Did the doctor chek on you?\"\nConsidering her daughter's nature to swallow the pain rather than depending on others, Anastasia believed she would have remained nonchalant this time as well.\nHowever, \"Austin brought a medic to check on me… so, yes.\"\nThat smile on her face helped the duo relax a little. Seeing their daughter unaffected by everything she had faced today brought them a sense of relief.\nAnastasia hugged her daughter again, this time softly, as she whispered, \"We are glad that he is by your side.\"\n\"Mm.\"\n°°°°°°°\nAustin had no clue how and why he was sleeping between his parents.\nSebastian left the tent under the pretense of going for a walk, and it was highly unlikely that the butler would return.\nAnd now, Austin was sleeping between the couple for some reason...\n\"Uh...I could have slept separately you know...\" Austin muttered. There was enough space in the tent to accommodate twenty people so he could have found himself a comfortable corner.\nHowever, \"It has been while since we united and have a chance to share a long conversation. Don't abandon your old father now.\" Cedric smilingly chided.\nAustin surrendered, \"What exactly do you want to talk about?\"\n\"It has been a while since we had a leisure chat like this so how about you start with your trip to Drenovar?\"\nAustin exhaled a long breath. Guess, there was no helping it.\n\"After leaving the capital...\"\nAustin and Cedric continued to chat for an hour. However, it was mostly Austin speaking; telling his father about his experience in Drenovar and also about his match in the tournament.\nCedric couldn't stop smiling even once while hearing his stories.\nIt was like Austin has been all over the world and has fought varities of entity in so less time.\nCedric never questioned him about his unnatural growth, trusting his son to already have an answer to this peculiarity.\nAround midnight, while talking to his father, Austin fell asleep.\nSeeing his comfortable sleeping face, Cedric smiled warmly.\nHis eyes went to his wife and he found her looking at Austin as well.\n\"Dear?\"\nSophie softly said, \"Even though we saw each other about half a month ago, it feels like I am looking at him after years.\"\nIt felt like, all the anxiety built inside her after Aiden death. All the stress melted while she looked at her son's serene face.\n\"Why didn't you talk to him?\" Cedric asked. She had such a good opportunity to talk to Austin, and seeing how easy going he seemed a few moments ago, Cedric knew Austin wouldn't have ignored her.\nHowever, \"No, my Lord. As Valerie said...I can only hope to fill this gap between us, after I forgive myself for what I have done. And I...haven't forgiven myself yet.\"\nCedric sighed seeing the tears in her eyes.\nAfter she returned to her senses, Sophie had been crying a lot...reminding Cedric of that time when Sophie initially got married to the family.\nBecause of strict rules and so many things she had to learn as a Queen, Sophie wept a lot. She really wasn't the best hardworker at that time.\nAnd now, she had a different reason to cry.\nShe was guilty for hurting her child.\nShe regrets throwing away the boy who once was everything for her.\nSophie regrets it. Everything.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "[Next morning]\nEveryone was told to gather in the center clearing of the field.\nApparently, someone from the Union Council was about to deliver a speech or something.\nAustin was with Valerie as they shared breakfast...which was actually just a banana that they broke from the middle.\nThey didn't get anything else to eat since most of the food counters were empty when they reached there.\nThankfully, Sebastian was able to save some food, which he offered to his young master. However, Austin told him to take the food to his parents.\nThe reaction Sebastian expressed was too shiny for his groggy eyes so he got done with the conversation soon.\n\"Do you want me to bring something for you?\" Valerie asked in slight concern.\nAustin fought more than anyone else yesterday, and after spending so much energy, he must be hungry. Not to talk about, the actual meal he had was about a day ago.\nHowever, \"The nearest town from here is about four hours away. So, let it be, Val.\" Austin was hungry but he didn't want to trouble Valerie. Even though she was faster than him, reaching the town would still take a toll and quite a lot of time.\nAnd anyway, they would be returning after the Council member gets done with their announcement.\n\"Hey, Rhea.\" Austin waved at the girl who was walking in a daze.\nHearing his voice, she jolted out of her stupor and looked at them.\n\"Good morning. Did you get something to eat?\" The sword wielder asked as she smilingly approached them.\nAustin flashed the peel of the banana they had just now.\nRhea looked worried and regretful, \"I...just finished the sandwiches Rudolph brought. I am really sorry.\" If she had known she definitely would have shared.\nAustin scoffed, \"That bastard didn't even ask me...\"\n\"Who knew that the two early wakers would wake up late today.\" Suddenly, the guy who was called 'bastard' just now, appeared behind Austin.\nThe blond Prince sighed, \"I, actually, woke up early but got busy chatting with Father. I tell you, he talks a lot.\"\nAlthough he said that, Austin was no less when it came to chatting.\nValerie had a similar reason, \"Mom kept talking to me until late night.\"\nRhea's lashes fluttered as she said, \"Talking about your mother, I met her yesterday. Such a sweet person.\"\nAfter Rhea's unexpected meeting with Parkinson, the pinkhead was walking around aimlessly, when the lady came to her, asking if she was hurt.\nRudolph asked, \"Did you meet them, Austin? Valerie's parents?\"\nThe person in question can only shake his head regrettably, \"Mother-in-law sleeping, father-in-law is currently with my father and Lord Idris. Never got the chance.\"\nAustin brushed his teeth, took a bath somehow—which was quite a luxury in this condition—and got properly ready for this meeting.\nHowever, when Valerie came to him, she informed him that her father left the tent to meet people and her mother was still in bed.\n\"Is this really a coincidence, or do your in-laws don't actually want to see your face?\" Rudolph teased, only to be glared at by Valerie.\nHowever, the raven-haired didn't stop grinning.\nAustin heaved a sigh, as he said, \"If they don't like me, I will make them like me. I might become double-minded about anything in my life except for Valerie.\"\nRhea sighed admirably while Valerie couldn't hide the blush that appeared more beautiful than a setting sun.\n\"Ah, here they are.\" Rudolph suddenly spoke as his eyes traveled towards a man who wore a white cloak over his body.\nThe insignia, on his chest, features a deep blue circular background, symbolizing resilience and wisdom. At its center, a majestic phoenix rises with its wings spread wide, its feathers shimmering in a gradient of fiery gold and crimson.\nThe man had long black hair and seemed quite young.\nOnce he stood on top of the makeshift stage, he addressed everyone,\n\"Good morning. I am Aston—one of the Council Heads.\"\nThose last few words earned collective gasps from people.\nIt was a rare sight—a Council Head standing openly before the people.\nMost never even learned their names before they were quietly replaced by new ones.\nAs the guardians of humanity's survival, they held knowledge too dangerous to share and bore secrets too heavy to reveal. For that reason, they rarely stepped into the public eye.\nThat was why the crowd stood frozen, their faces filled with awe and disbelief.\nIgnoring their reaction, the man continued, \"I feel deeply remorseful after learning about what you went through last day. Because we were short on personnel we couldn't protect those whom we swore to defend. I am even ashamed to stand before you all.\"\nThe man began, his voice polite but didn't leave an impact on Austin.\nHe was saying nothing from his heart. He can even sense slight disappointment in his eyes...or maybe Austin was just reading him a little too much.\n'The Council only respects the strong...and surely, those who died held no importance to them.' Although it was cruel, following the tradition of prioritizing the strong had always been helpful for them.\nThe man continued, \"We have already contacted the family of the deceased ones, and they will be compensated for their loss.\"\nRudolph snickered upon hearing those words and the people around him knew the reason behind that reaction.\nThere could be no compensation for death. One cannot heal such a grave and permanent wound by a few coins or consolation.\nBut well, there was nothing these few teenagers could do or say here.\n\"Now, coming to the conclusion, I would like to thank the person who helped us all to overcome this disaster. The only one who not only saved the students from the army of demons but also exterminated their leader.\"\nTurning his eyes toward Valerie, Aston said, \"Please join me, Miss Valerie.\"\nEveryone began clapping for the girl when that name came out.\nEveryone who survived witnessed how gallantly Valerie fought and saved the other students—even those who shunned her previously.\nShe was that raging flame of hope that eradicated hopelessness from others' minds and gave them a concrete reason to push forward.\nUnder the appreciation of everyone Valerie, without hesitation, walked towards the stage and stood beside Aston.\n\"I would like to show my humble gratitude for what you have done, Miss Valerie.\" The man bowed his head and for the first time, Austin saw the man not masking his emotions.\nHe was genuinely elated to share the stage with her.\nHowever, Valerie ignored him completely, and while facing the students, she declared, \"Although I defeated those demons yesterday, the only reason I arrived there at that time was because of a certain person.\"\nHer words surprised people. Lord Corwon also raised his brows as he heard his daughter adding,\n\"When I was taken away from the venue under the accusation of killing someone, I was pulled inside a barrier which weakened me to the point where I couldn't even stand on my feet.\"\nThose words were extremely more surprising than her last statement. An S-rank weakened to the point she couldn't balance herself?\n\"The enemy though, wasn't weakened. After all, he was the one who formed a barrier so near the venue without the Council noticing anything.\"\nAston's smile faltered as he looked at the lady beside him with a wary look. What is she talking about now?\nDespite the mixed reaction she received, Valerie didn't stop from disclosing the truth, \"The person who came to save me, then brought me to the venue and even saved his parents from hundreds of Demons is Austin. I know many of you won't believe my words, but your opinion doesn't matter. I know in my heart that if not for him, I and you all, wouldn't have been standing here today. That's all.\"\nSaying so, she stepped down the stage\nWhen she went there, people were applauding. And now that she was returning, there was utter silence.\nNo one said anything after that until Aston decided to change the topic,\n\"Carriages have already been...\"\nAustin didn't pay attention to the man and kept looking at his girl, who stood beside him with an expression that showed nonchalance.\n\"What did we talk about, Val? That you will not reveal to others about it?\"\nValerie looked at her fiancé. Her eyes were dead serious, which even startled Austin, as he heard her saying,\n\"You deserve to be praised. I am tired of people badmouthing you and since I am forbidden from freezing everyone, I want them to know how great my man is.\"\nHearing her displeased tone, he yielded right away, \"....okay.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Well, thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Students were either heading home or returning to the academy.\nThose who lived in the capital were taken straight to their homes by carriage, while those from distant or hard-to-reach places had to stop at the academy first, where further transportation would be arranged.\nNaturally, every academy was in turmoil after the incident, and classes had already been suspended indefinitely.\n\"It's almost half of what we saw during the first round...\" Rudolph muttered under his breath as he saw the students filling the carriages and departing for their destination. A safe place.\n\"What about you?\" Rhea, who was standing beside him, asked with her hands folded.\nMaybe it was because she wanted to divert her mind from the scene before her, she turned towards Rudolph.\nAlong with the students, the dead bodies were also transported to the graveyard. And that scene...pricked Rhea's heart with a thousand needles.\nPeople in her hometown deemed her someone who could save humanity from the disease called demons. However, all she could call herself right now was 'disappointment.'\nRhea, once again, panicked in an emergency situation.\nHer mind was all over the place, trying to save everyone but failing miserably. It was not until Valerie arrived that she felt that everything would be fine now.\nHowever, when Rhea left her hometown, she never intended to rely on others.\nSo even though the situation had been resolved, a bitter feeling lingered—once again, everything had fallen onto Valerie's shoulders.\n\"Rhea?\" Rudolph softly called out, his hand resting on her fragile trembling shoulder.\nThe pinkhead broke out of her daze as she shook her head and said, \"It's nothing. Anyway, are you returning to the Capital?\"\nRudolph understood what was weighing on her mind, but offering comforting words now would only come off as irritating.\nHe knew this because if someone told him, \"You did what you could,\" in a moment like this, it would only make him more frustrated.\nSome battles are meant to be fought alone.\nAnd the one raging inside Rhea's mind was hers and hers alone to win.\n\"Father sent a letter through Sebastian. He couldn't come because of security reasons but he expects me to return as soon as possible.\" Rudolph doesn't generally receive a letter from his father. Not only that, he even used a strict tone in his letter which made it clear that Rudolph couldn't delay his visit back home.\nRhea nodded, \"You should go. I will also return to my hometown as well.\" It has been a while since she met her favorite neighbors and had lunch at her favorite bakery.\nAnd considering her current mental health, she really needs some healing.\n\"Rudolph.\" Suddenly, Austin called out from a little far away.\nRudolph gave him a nod before he turned towards Rhea. Heaving a sigh, he rested his hands on her shoulder and said, \"Okay...take care. Have a safe journey.\"\nRhea smilingly nodded before she went on her toes, and out of the blue, she gave a kiss on his cheek.\nIt was a sight to witness.\nA big six-foot-something guy having his eyes round and ear tips dyed in red.\nRhea grinned at him, as she said, \"Thanks for saving me. See you later.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nInside the carriage, along with the two royalties that came from Eryndor, there were four more people.\nThe carriage was big and was pulled by four horses.\nOn the left side was Valerie, sitting between her parents.\nOn the right was the King and the Queen with their son on the side.\nIt was an awkward atmosphere in the carriage since the most talkative one, Valerie's mother, was quite nervous in the presence of the Queen.\nAnastasia was acquainted with the Queen. However, she hadn't met her ever since 'that' happened. And now, the lady of the Corwon family has no idea how she should approach Sophie.\nThe first person to speak, amidst the awkward silence, was Adam, \"Austin...I'd like to apologize to you.\"\nThe blond Prince was taken aback by the statement, as he said, \"W-What happened, Sir Corwon?\"\nHe really didn't have a clue why the older one suddenly lowered his head.\nAdam didn't hesitate in confessing, \"I, actually, suggested Valerie break the engagement a few weeks ago. Thinking that you are not a good match for her.\"\nAustin released a mental 'ooh' upon hearing that. He heard about that from Valerie.\nApparently, Aiden brainwashed the man into believing that Valerie was not suited with Austin and that she should leave Austin.\nThe actual reason why Aiden's life thread was prematurely severed was because of this move. His attempt to separate Valerie and Austin caused the bastard to lose his life.\n\"I am truly apologetic. I was blinded by doubts and tried to...\" With his shoulders dropped, he added, \"But soon, I realized how utterly I was wrong. Nothing matters to me more than Valerie's happiness and you, son, you are her happiness.\"\nAustin released a soft breath, his eyes drawn to the ground.\nSlowly, he raised his eyes and glanced at Valerie.\nHer beautiful lavender eyes were fixated on him.\nThere was no explanation Austin needed to make to convince his father-in-law. From what it appeared, it seems he has already accepted him.\nTurning towards Adam, Austin said, \"Thank you for trusting me, Sir Corwon.\"\nAdam flashed a soft smile when suddenly, his wife voiced, \"You call him so formally, but I won't listen to you until you don't call me 'Mom', Austin.\"\nThat gained a soft chuckle from Cedric and Sophie also smiled in glee.\nAustin was slightly embarrassed but he didn't shy away from calling out to her, \"Okay...mom.\"\nAnastasia's face lit up with joy—but before she could utter a single word, an overwhelming, nightmarish presence crashed down upon the carriage.\nSCREEEECH!\nThe carriage lurched to an abrupt stop. Bodies were thrown forward as if an invisible force had shoved them.\nA suffocating pressure filled the air. Every breath felt like inhaling thick, rotting sludge. The passengers sat frozen, their faces drained of color—except for the two teenagers. Unlike the others, they had already stared death in the eye before. Even so, the sheer weight of this presence made their skin crawl.\nCedric's throat tightened. His body refused to move.\n\"This… presence…\" he whispered, his breath shallow. Even inside the magic-resistant carriage, the miasma pressed in, squeezing the air from his lungs.\n\"Agh… d-dear… I—\" Anastasia clutched her stomach, her body convulsing. A sickening retch tore from her throat as she doubled over, barely able to keep herself from vomiting.\nOutside, something was waiting. Watching. And it was hungry.\nAustin glanced at Valerie and both of them instantly shot out of the carriage.\n\"Austin!\" Sophie called out, but it was already too late.\nAustin and Valerie turned in the direction from where such an upsetting sensation was arriving—and soon, his body froze in disbelief.\nEight feet tall, a monstrosity that shouldn't have appeared here in the human realm.\nBulging muscles, red blood-like skin, tattoos crawling like veins, and two long tusks that reached half of its face.\nEvery step it took, the ground trembled. The greenery around the monster was fading under the miasma it released.\nAlthough the inhumane was far away, Austin saw and recognized it the instance he saw it.\nOne of the four demon generals—The Orc Lord.\n'How the hell did it awaken?!'\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- For your information, every single General is above S-rank.

      "content": "The four Demon Generals under the command of the Demon King were nothing less than impossible opponents for Rhea to defeat.\nEven against the weakest General, the Succubus Queen, Rhea had to take the support of several comrades and had to go beyond her limits to put her down.\nIt wasn't just the off-power scaling of humans and demons; these beings have lived for thousands of years, so they hold experience several times more than humans.\nEvery single Demon General was above S-rank, however, humans are restricted to that rank.\nAnd this one, the Orc Lord, was the second-strongest Demon General.\nHowever, canonically, he shouldn't have awoken around this time. There was definitely something wrong...someone pulled the strings from the shadows and now, they were facing a catastrophic danger.\n\"Sir?\" Sebastian also appeared beside them, a deep frown marring his face.\nThe butler could tell just by a glance that this opponent was far stronger than any being he had come across until now. Not even the Demon General who appeared in Drenovar, exerted such an overwhelming force.\nAnd the most astonishing part—the demon wasn't affected by the sun, at all!\n\"Sebastian...you need to take them away.\" Austin voiced and his tone clearly signified that he wouldn't ask again.\nSebastian clenched his fist and looked at the opponent again.\nInside the carriage were two unawakened ladies, and a man who was still recovering. Under these circumstances, they would be severely damaged just by being present near the battlefield.\nValerie had already summoned her weapon—the mythical armament—Shiverfall.\nUnlike the time she faced Zevarath, her Shard was shining brightly under the sun.\nSebastian made the decision soon.\nHe turned towards the carriage and was about to take the carriage away when suddenly, Cedric and Adam jumped out.\n\"My Lord...you should-\"\n\"No, Sebas. This battle is not something we can run away from. That being is a terror that can threaten a country all alone.\" The King voiced in a stern tone, his Shard appearing by his side and his eyes never leaving the figure of the huge demon.\nAdam told the butler, \"Just bring the two ladies to safety...they have fainted.\"\nSebastian followed his orders and took them away.\nBack in the battlefield, Valerie seemed prepared.\nThis opponent was stronger than the Demon General she fought back in Drenovar. However, at that time, she had to hold back because of the Headmaster's warning. However, now,\n\"Absolute Zero.\"\n—she cannot hold back.\n*CRACK*\nA huge circle appeared near the Orc Lord before the temperature began to fall at an abyssal rate.\nTrees, grass, and even the birds within the circle froze and fell.\nHowever, the demon didn't stop. Its body was protected by the dark miasma it was radiating.\nThe violette clenched her fist, before she dashed toward the Demon.\nAustin was still standing, ready to assist. Even in his Berserk state, he wouldn't be able to help her right now. So he was rather focused on backup and assistance if needed.\nThe moment Valerie dashed forward, the frozen ground beneath her shattered, leaving a trail of ice shards in her wake. She closed the distance in a blink, her spear already thrusting toward the Orc Lord's chest.\nCLANG!\nThe impact sent a shockwave through the air, yet the spear barely dug in. The demon's thick, miasma-coated skin resisted the attack. Snarling, the Orc Lord swung its massive axe down. Valerie twisted her body, the blade missing her by inches as it split the frozen earth behind her.\nShe retaliated.\nHer spear spun, striking like a viper—one, two, three precise thrusts aimed at the beast's joints. Each blow landed with enough force to tear through stone, yet the Orc Lord barely flinched.\nBAM!\nA backhand strike sent Valerie skidding across the battlefield, her boots carving deep grooves in the frost-covered ground. She didn't stop. The moment she regained her footing, she launched herself forward again.\n\"Frost Fang!\"\nIce erupted along her spear's edge as she slashed at the demon's side. The freezing force spread, creeping up its arm, but with a violent shake, the miasma burned through the ice, shattering it like brittle glass.\nThe Orc Lord roared and swung again. This time, Valerie couldn't fully dodge.\nCRACK!\nPain shot through her side as the axe clipped her ribs, sending her flying. She crashed through a frozen tree, splintered and ice raining down. Blood dripped from her lips, but she didn't stop.\nValerie raised her hand before several ice glaciers appeared in the air.\nThe Orc Lord flinched as it also looked up, however, the thick legs of the demons didn't allow it to dash away in time, before,\n**BOOOOOOOM**\nA devastating blow that sent tremors kilometers away, resonated once the three glaciers dropped on top of the demon general.\nA huge crater was formed on the surface, and if not for Adam and Cedric taking each other's support in time, they would have fallen down by the shockwave.\nThis wasn't the first time Austin had seen Valerie's power...but every time, she left him baffled.\nThe dust cleared, and the three huge ice chunks were still dug into the ground. And just when Valerie thought, that the battle might be over,\n\"*UGOOOOOOOOOOOH*\" A cry that shook the battlefield echoed from beneath the ice.\nCRACK—CRACK—BOOM!\nThe glaciers trembled before they exploded from within, shards of ice shooting in all directions. A monstrous figure emerged from the debris, its body covered in deep wounds, yet still standing.\nThe Orc Lord's dark miasma surged violently, evaporating the frost clinging to its skin. Its crimson eyes burned with fury as it stomped forward, shaking the earth.\nValerie barely had a moment to react before the demon charged—a blur despite its massive size.\nWHAM!\nA massive fist struck her mid-air, sending her rocketing backward. She hit the ground hard, rolling several times before skidding to a stop. The taste of blood filled her mouth, but she forced herself up.\nShe wasn't expecting the demon to be that fast.\nThe following battle was a blur.\nThe two figures clashed at a pace that Austin could only follow with his eyes.\nNeither side was too overwhelming for their opponent but both of them were receiving damage gradually.\nA very disturbing thought suddenly assaulted Austin's mind...was the Orc Lord really that weak?\nThere was no doubt that Valerie was strong but the Orc Lord Austin expected should have been much more devastating and overpowered.\n'Is it because of its early awakening?'\nRegardless of the reason, soon Austin found his chance to act.\nSummoning Ashen Maul he dashed forward.\nThe Orc Lord came flying his way, so utilizing the chance he lifted the mace above his head and swung down with full force.\nBOOOOM!\nThe impact was earth-shattering. The moment the Ashen Maul connected with the Orc Lord's shoulder, an explosive shockwave erupted, sending a deep tremor through the battlefield. The demon's body lurched downward, its massive frame barely holding against the devastating blow.\nValerie didn't waste the opening.\nCRACK—CRACK—CRACK!\nShe struck three times in quick succession, her spear glowing with icy blue light.\nEach thrust drove the frost deeper into the demon's body, slowing its movements as its flesh began to stiffen.\nThe Orc Lord roared and swung wildly, forcing both of them back. But its movement was visibly sluggish now.\nThe miasma was growing and healing its wounds which clearly told that the Orc Lord would recover in no time.\nValerie glanced at her beloved, and that gaze told him what she was about to do.\nShe was, once again, going to defy the flow of time.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you all liked the chapter? Once again, it would take some time, not much now, for Austin to reach that stage. Drop a comment",

      "content": "\"Huh...?\" Selner jolted.\nTurning her eyes toward the window, she felt a very familiar but ominous presence arriving from the distance.\nThe book from her hand fell to the ground. Her throat turned dry and her eyes trembled.\nThis presence...how can this be...\nHer body moved on instincts.\nShe couldn't be wrong.\nIt was him.\nThe greatest foe that humanity has ever come across.\nThe being who even threatened the immortal beings.\nThe threat that never should have appeared.\nThe Great Demon Lord—Astaroth.\n'How can he appear now?! Wasn't there some time left?!'\nSelner's mind was in turmoil. There was still more than a year left for the Demon Lord to resurrect. And no event has transpired that could hasten the rebirth.\nShe has been keeping an eye on the collision between the two sides, that's why—ah.\n'Did the battle between the Demon General and Austin get his attention?'\nRegardless of the reason, Selner didn't pause even for a moment until she reached the source of the malice.\nHer eyes caught the scene of the battlefield.\nThe frost clung to her body as she approached the clearing where two familiar individuals stood side by side.\nShe could see a few more people in the background, but her focus was majorly on the prison of ice hanging mid-air.\n'So she unlocked the Stasis Lock...' Selner narrowed her eyes—this spell shouldn't have been within the grasp of the little girl yet.\n\"Selner?\" Austin, who caught the levitating figure to be familiar, called out.\nThe Witch slowly descended to the ground, her attire making it evident to those who don't know her that she is a Council Member.\n\"Valerie...Austin, are you two alright?\" Adam asked as he and Cedric advanced towards the two children.\nAustin gave a soft nod, before he directed his eyes toward his father, \"What about Sebastian and the other two?\"\n\"I told him to take them away. Don't worry, they are safe.\" Cedric assured him.\n\"You knew about the thing?\" Valerie suddenly asked the older lady in a stern voice.\nConsidering how hastily she arrived here, Selner must know something about the Demon.\nAustin, hesitantly, asked, \"Madame Selner, was it one of the Four Generals?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What...!\" Cedric and Adam, who naturally were aware of the Four Generals, couldn't hide their shock upon hearing Austin.\nThe four infamous Generals were the pawns of the Demon Lord who ruled over the planet a thousand years ago.\nThey were given different regions to govern, and their cruelty was etched in every history book.\nThe era of darkness. A period where humans were treated as merely livestock and slaves.\nAnd a being who was previously killed by the renowned Hero Kane, re-appeared a thousand years later?\nExcept for Austin and Selner, the other three were shocked beyond belief.\nThe short-haired lady looked at the Orc Lord trapped in the ice prison before she voiced, \"Although the presence it holds is similar to a Demon General, he doesn't seem as strong as what I assumed.\"\nAustin frowned but didn't say anything here. However, in his mind, he agreed with her.\nThis Demon General was quite weaker than its canon counterpart. Although it was still quite stronger than Austin, it didn't live up to its position as the second-strongest General.\n\"Maybe because of its early awakening?\" The Witch thoughtfully muttered as she kept looking at the ice prison.\nValerie was about to ask something, but a sound caught her attention.\n*CRACK*\nValerie's eyes parted wide as the ice prison she formed started to crack from within.\nSelner also was shocked since she was aware of the strength of the spell she used.\nAustin summoned his Shard on instincts and prepared for another battle.\nHowever, only the head of the Orc Lord was liberated from the Ice Prison.\nThen—\nIts skin rippled.\nThe thick, red flesh twisted as if something inside was crawling beneath, forcing its way out. The orc's once-monstrous face began to sink inward, its jaw stretching unnaturally, bones snapping and reforming with sickening pops.\nRed eyes.\nThey flickered open—deep, ancient, and burning with malice.\nCedric's breath hitched as he watched the last remnants of the Orc Lord melt away, its coarse features replaced by something far more horrifying.\nLong, white hair cascaded down, tangled and ghostly. Its strands shimmered with an eerie glow, swaying though there was no wind. The skin beneath was wrinkled yet unyielding like ancient parchment stretched over something that refused to die. Deep lines marked the face, carved by centuries of hatred.\nSelner's knees nearly gave out as the transformation was completed.\nAnd then—\nIt looked up.\nA wave of dread rolled over them, crushing, suffocating. The sheer weight of its presence made the air thick as if the world itself recoiled from this being's return.\nAustin clenched his fists, his instincts screaming at him to move, to attack—but his body refused.\nThis wasn't just a demon.\nThis was something far worse.\nSomething that had no right to exist—yet did.\nThe Demon Lord Astaroth had appeared.\n\"Ah... how long has it been since I've breathed such fresh air?\" His voice was not of this world—low, guttural, and crawling into the bones of those who heard it. A voice that did not simply speak, but commanded silence.\nHis presence alone was suffocating. It pressed down like an unseen weight, the sheer malice of it making even Valerie—who had faced horrors beyond count—feel something she had never truly felt before. Fear.\nHer body refused to move. Her breath hitched. The very Shard in her grasp wavered, flickering like a candle before a storm. This was not an enemy she could fight. This was something beyond her.\n\"You... how are you here?!\" Selner's voice snapped through the paralysis. Her fists clenched, magic crackling around her as she instinctively threw up a barrier. It flickered under Astaroth's mere presence.\nThe Demon Lord slowly turned his gaze toward her, his crimson eyes gleaming with nothing but disdain.\n\"Woman, silence.\" His words were laced with venom, yet spoken with effortless authority. \"You are beneath my notice.\"\nSelner gritted her teeth, magic surging, but before she could retaliate, Astaroth's attention shifted.\nTo Austin.\n\"Ah… there you are.\" His lips curled into something resembling a smile, yet there was no warmth—only a predator's amusement. \"How fortunate. For the first time in my long existence, I feel inclined to thank the gods.\"\nAustin's blood ran cold. That voice. That knowing tone.\nWhy…? Why did the Demon Lord speak his name with such familiarity?\nAstaroth's eyes gleamed with something dark. \"You have changed, haven't you?\" He tilted his head as if studying an amusing trick. \"You care for the weak now. You even killed one of my foot soldiers… all for her.\"\nHis gaze slid toward Valerie, slow and deliberate.\nAustin's hands clenched into fists. \"What do you want?\"\nAstaroth's response was a low hum, his eyes shifting skyward as if considering something inconsequential.\nThen, he looked down—directly at Austin.\n\"I could be merciful.\" His lips curled wider, exposing too many teeth. \"I could spare your precious humans. Your friends. Even the ones you love.\"\nA moment passed. Then, he spoke again.\n\"I will even return to my slumber... if you wish.\"\nThe air itself seemed to be still.\nAnd then—\n\"All you have to do…\" His voice dropped lower, silkier, yet crackling with malice. \"...is slit your own throat and die like the worthless dog you are—right here, before me.\"\nA deathly silence followed.\nAnd for the first time—Austin felt his heartbeat thunder in his ears.\nAmidst the growing silence, Valerie suddenly raised her Shard and thumped the rear end on the ground.\nThe ice prison started to break under her command, breaking the body of the Orc Lord along with it as well.\n**CRACK**\nThe demon lord grinned, his face fading into darkness, as he voiced,\n\"Glad to hear that answer....hunting you...will be much more fun.\"\nOnce the Catastrophe was silenced, Austin instantly turned toward Selner and said,\n\"I think you have a few answers to share. And I need to know them. Now.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Selner dreaded this moment.\nShe knew she would be asked about it. The past which Austin no longer remembers.\nHowever, this was a little early and Austin was not ready to hear everything.\n'But what can I do?' The Demon Lord appeared out of nowhere and after hearing his words, Austin surely would be eager to know what connects him with the Dark Lord.\nShe could not turn her face away from him here, or Austin probably would try to find the answer from a different source. And that could be dangerous.\n\"Madame Selner?\" Austin called out again; impatience evident in his voice.\nThe short-haired woman heaved a sigh as she said, \"I will tell you. Be prepared in the evening.\"\nAustin hurriedly asked, \"How will you find us?\" He wasn't sure, as of now, where they would be heading after this. That's why, he asked.\nSelner shook her head softly, \"You don't need to worry about that. I will find you.\"\nHearing that tone, and those eyes, Valerie shifted subtly on her feet with her gaze narrowing.\nAustin trusted her words since there was nothing else he could do, \"I will be waiting for you.\"\nWith that exchange, the lady disappeared from their sight—which greatly surprised Austin and Valerie since if she actually flew away rather than teleporting, then she might be significantly stronger than what they assumed from their first meeting.\nTurning towards the others, Austin said, \"We should get going. The sun is about to set.\"\nAdam and Cedric first checked on their child and asked a few things before they headed toward the place where Sebastian awaited them.\nUnsurprisingly, the old man was just far away to not get caught in the battle but close enough to keep an eye on the battle.\nHis protective side was impartial.\nThey boarded the carriage and decided to first take shelter.\nA lot has happened and Austin really needed a few hours of mental rest.\n°°°°°°°\n'System, anything you can share?' While they were seated in the carriage and were heading to their destination, Austin asked the system.\nThey weren't going to the Capital but rather to Corwon's territory. It was nearer than the Capital, and right now, everyone wanted some rest.\nValerie was currently leaning on Austin, her eyes closed and her breathing calm.\nShe hadn't had any food since morning and then that battle where she utilized an S-rank spell. Naturally, she would be exhausted.\nThere was a brief pause before the System informed us,\n[There is no information to share, host.]\nAustin wasn't expecting anything from the System. He has, until now, received no information about this world from the System. Whenever he asked, it was rather restricted information or something it didn't know.\nAustin sighed. His source of information was limited. And he was excessively impatient to know his answers.\nThis was the first time Austin saw the Demon Lord. He has only heard about him in both lives.\nEven Rhea never came across the final foe and before Luke could have reached that stage, he died.\nSo yes, this was the first time for him to see what the human's greatest enemy looked like.\nHowever, rather than focusing on Valerie—who was one of the strongest human warriors—he was more focused on Austin. Rather, it would be more appropriate to say that Astaroth never looked at Valerie and focused more on Selner and Austin.\nBut why him? Did he do something? Was his unnatural growth caught the attention of the Demon Lord? He highly doubted that.\nThen what? The System?\n'Can be possible. However, why did it seem, he knew me?'\nHe had a lot of questions, but right now, all he could do was repeat the questions again and again.\n\"We are here, young master,\" Sebastian informed and that call alerted Valerie as she woke up.\n\"You okay?\" Austin asked in a hushed tone.\nValerie softly smiled and gave a brief nod, \"Mm...sorry, I fell asleep.\"\n\"Nothing to worry. Now let's go inside.\"\nValerie nodded before she stepped down from the carriage.\n\"Agh...\" As Cedric tried to get up, he groaned.\n\"Father?\" Austin asked.\nCedric shook his head, \"Just my feet are numb...I will be fine.\"\nRegardless of what he said, Austin went to support him.\nAdam carried his wife and got down from the carriage followed by Valerie and Austin, who supported his father\nSebastian took Cedric from Austin, \"I will help him,\" he said before draping his Lord's arm over his shoulder and heading towards the mansion.\nAustin climbed the carriage and picked his mother in his arms.\nShe was still sleeping and that was better. After what she went through, her mind needed some hours of rest.\nHe slowly hopped off the carriage and fortunately, she didn't wake up.\nOnce he stepped inside, he saw Valerie waiting for him.\nShe gestured towards the maid before she bowed.\nValerie led him to the gallery on the left.\nThey didn't talk a word, mutually deciding to prioritize the Queen's sleep now.\nOnce they reached the room, Valerie opened the room for him, before Austin stepped inside.\nIt was a pretty huge room with a king-sized bed across from the door.\nHe gently lay the lady on the bed.\nHer face was slightly pale, and there was something caught his attention.\nA pearly droplet near the corner of her left eye.\nHer expression was slightly tense as well, as if she was having a nightmare.\nAustin took a deep breath before wiping her tears and whispering, \"You are safe.\"\nHe didn't know if she was actually asleep since his words soothed her anxiety, and the frown on her face slowly receded.\nHer complexion turned normal and the lady started breathing normally.\nValerie, who was at the entrance, couldn't stop herself from smiling at the sight.\nAlthough the Queen failed to be a good mother, Austin didn't fail her as a son.\nAustin soon got up and turned towards his beloved, as he asked smilingly, \"Are you disappointed?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"I fell for you again.\"\nAustin was flustered for a moment before he pulled her by her arm and said, \"Not a great time to tease me. Now show me your room.\"\nNow Valerie was flustered, \"Y-You are going to stay there?\" Her heart rate elevated by that thought. She didn't know why, but sharing the same bed on which she had always dreamed about him....it felt so wrong but so exciting at the same time...\n\"Haha...I just want to see your room.\" They weren't married yet, that's why staying in the same room would not be liked by Valerie's and his parents.\nValerie released a sigh—that contained both relief and disappointment—before she began leading him to the upper floor.\n\"My lady, good to see you back.\" A certain maid was standing before Valerie's room and gave a brief bow to the girl with a smile on her face.\n\"Ah, Miss Sally. How have you been?\"\n\"I am quite well. Thank you for worrying, Miss Valerie.\"\nValerie nodded before she realized she hadn't introduced Austin to her.\n\"Austin...this...\"\n\"I know. Your first teacher and someone who taught you baking. The only person you freely conversed with was when you were a child. She came to the Capital once, I remember.\"\nBoth Valerie and the maid were surprised to hear that Austin remembers the details.\nAnd the surprise elevated when Austin bowed his head and said, \"I am extremely thankful for being there for Valerie. She told me how you were always there in her bad times, helping her and encouraging her. So once again, I am thankful for what you did for her.\"\nThe older woman's eyes turned moist seeing the boy before her.\nShe actually was aware of their worsened relationship after Aiden returned. The last time Sally saw Austin, he was ignoring Valerie and didn't even eat the cookies she brought for him.\nThat broke Sally's heart and since that day, she couldn't stop disliking the Prince.\nHowever, today, all those years worth of hatred melted instantly.\nBringing her hand on Austin's shoulder, she warmly said, \"Don't thank me...just keep Valerie happy. It would be more than enough for me.\"\nAustin raised his head, a smile extending his lips, as he said, \"I will, Miss Sally.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you all liked the chapter.

      "content": "\"For now, I have no clue.\" This discussion was taking place in the reception hall of the mansion.\nThe people involved in these were the King, the man of the house, Valerie, and Austin. On the side, Sebastian remained standing in silence.\nThe content of the discussion, surely, was the Demon General that appeared today.\n\"I think the Union Council has already gotten the news by now about the General's appearance,\" Adam suggested after hearing from Austin about his lack of information about the General.\nTruth be told, Austin does know a few things about the Generals and how they can appear on this side without alerting the security, but he kept silent on the matter.\nAgain, it all comes down to how much he could trust people who are not Valerie.\n\"The major problem would arise if people get to know about it,\" Cedric muttered with a frown on his face.\nThe Demon King arising from death would cause pandemonium. There was no doubt that the world peace would be at risk.\n\"It's highly unlikely the general masses would know about it unless we or the Council tell them.\" Austin voiced, believing the battle and what followed it, was not seen by any onlooker.\nHowever, \"That could be dangerous, sir.\" Sebastian voiced, pulling everyone's attention towards him.\nThe grey-haired man continued, \"Informing them in advance so they could actively prepare for the war is far better than keeping them in the dark, only to let a wave of chaos crash down upon them.\"\nSebastian's suggestion settled in everyone's mind. It seemed like the most rational conclusion.\nHowever, the problem was, \"Will the Council allow us to reveal it?\" Adam asked in an unsure tone.\nThe Union Council seeks world peace while tackling all the dangers by themselves.\nNaturally, they would refrain from letting the general public know that humanity's greatest adversary has returned.\nA brief silence ensued before Cedric said, \"We should leave the decision to the Council.\"\n\"But Father...\" Austin was stopped by Cedric as he said,\n\"Yes, but we can surely prepare for the war by fortifying our defenses. People might suspect things and the Council might not like our movements, but we need to be prepared for what is to come.\"\nCedric was concerned about the whole human race since the enemy in question had ruled over the planet a thousand years ago.\nHowever, if the Defensive Pillar of humanity refrains from disclosing about the Demon Lord's revival, as a King, all Cedric can do is to safeguard his territory.\nIf he can't save the whole human race, he, at least, would ensure that Eryndor survives for as long as possible.\nNo one said anything against it.\nAfter a brief pause, Austin got up from his seat, and said, \"I will go meet her.\"\nThere was none who didn't know who this 'her' was, whom he was so eager to meet.\nValerie also got up, naturally, to follow him.\n\"Are you sure I can't come, son?\" Cedric asked in a weak tone.\nHowever, that didn't work on the young noble, \"I am pretty sure that she won't like me having people with me. Valerie is an exception.\"\nHe didn't explain why Valerie was an exception and bid them farewell.\nSebastian also seemed to want to accompany them, but Austin's response to his father left the man with no option but just to see them go.\nThey walked out of the mansion with their hands connected.\nThe weather was pretty nice since the whole territory was surrounded by dense forest.\nThe low buzzing of crickets and the slow breeze presented a very serene atmosphere for a walk.\nAustin still had no idea how Selner would find them, but he had no other choice but to wait for her.\nWell, if she doesn't appear before him today, Austin knows where he could find her.\n\"Are you worried?\" Valerie asked him.\nAustin raised his brows, \"About the Demon Lord?\" A nod from her ushered him to add, \"Not really. I actually anticipated it. Somehow knew that he would return. However, his familiarity with me indeed worries me.\"\nValerie had a bitter expression, \"That malicious voice...that presence...I only read in books how even a glimpse of that face kept people awake for several nights.\"\nEven Valerie, who was regarded as one of the strongest humans, felt worthless before that entity.\nShe felt utterly helpless before the Demon Lord. The darkness he radiated wasn't just an absence of light—it devoured warmth, hope, and every shred of belief she clung to. His mere presence was a crushing force as if existence itself rejected the notion of happiness in his wake.\n\"Ah...\" Valerie's focus returned to their joined hands as Austin squeezed hers and softly said,\n\"I am here, Val.\"\nValerie's eyes were focused on nothing else but him.\nJust simple three words and she felt all the dark clouds from her mind, dispering.\n\"Should I have arrived late?\"\nA voice broke their trance as the couple turned toward the woman who appeared before them without a sound.\n\"Good evening, Madame Selner.\" Austin has gotten used to people disturbing them when they are having a moment, so he was able to retain his calm while speaking to her.\nValerie didn't say anything and stood silently by his side.\nThe lady, in response, looked at their connected hands, before asking Austin, \"I'd suggest you come with me alone. And trust me, this is for her benefit.\"\nValerie's hold on his hand stiffened as she narrowed her gaze.\nAustin was surprised as he asked, \"Can't she hear what you are going to say?\"\nSelner clearly told him, \"What I am about to show you...might break her trust in you. So choose very wisely.\"\nAustin's heart....trembled at those words.\nSomething that can break Valerie's trust?\nEven repeating it inside his head made him anxious.\nThe very thought of Valerie directing a distrustful look made him gulp in nervousness.\nHowever, on the other hand, \"Nothing in the world can make me distrustful towards him. Please tell us whatever you know.\"\nHer voice held no hesitation. And that helped Austin to realize something very crucial.\nHe trusted Selner's warning more than his relationship. And that is awful.\nIntertwining his fingers with hers, Austin spoke with certainty, \"Whatever it is, I want us both to witness it together.\"\nThat's right. He shouldn't doubt Valerie. She has shown trust in him when the world belittled him. So he should also trust her this time.\nSelner sighed, \"Your choice. Now summon your Shard and extend it towards me.\"\nAustin and Valerie shared a glance, feeling weirded out by the request, but they followed her words and summoned their Shard.\nOnce the tip of their Shard touched Selner's hand—the world moved.\nOr, to be more precise, they jumped through an invisible portal that threw their bodies at a pace that was extremely excruciating.\n\"Agh.\" Austin winced as his feet landed back on solid ground.\nEven though it was merely for three seconds, he felt several concrete blocks had fallen over his stomach. Not a pleasant feeling\nValerie also had a bitter expression as she held her stomach and her other hand rubbed Austin's back.\n\"Common symptoms for someone teleporting for the first time.\" The Witch voiced in a plain voice as she looked at the two struggling teenagers.\nAustin bought two potions from the system before handing one to Valerie.\n\"Thank you...\" Valerie muttered as she consumed the potion.\nOnce both of them calmed down, Austin took in his surroundings.\nIt was...a vast clearing, surrounded by sakura trees in full bloom. Their soft pink petals danced in the air, carried by a gentle breeze. The ground was covered in a delicate layer of fallen blossoms, creating a scene that felt almost dreamlike.\nThe air was fresh, filled with the faint, sweet scent of cherry blossoms. Birds chirped softly in the distance, and the rustling of leaves added to the peaceful silence. It was a place untouched by time, where the world felt calm and at ease.\n\"Where are we?\" Valerie asked in a daze. The place was so beautiful that she was left breathless.\nSelner didn't respond to her query, rather, she said, \"Follow me.\"\nShe began walking ahead of them, and soon, the two teenagers followed silently.\nThe moment of truth was before them as Selner soon came to a pause.\nShe raised her hand and for the first time, Austin saw her Shard.\nIt was a wooden magical staff with a red orb floating atop the staff.\nIt was nothing fancy but seemed quite detailed and extruded strength.\nShe raised her Shard a little before thumping the butt of the staff on the ground.\n*Ting*\nThe sound of a bell resonated before the ground began to tremble.\nAustin and Valerie looked closely as the ground before Selner began to part from the middle before a rectangular block was slowly pushed above the surface.\nSelner massaged her forehead, looking unnaturally tense before she moved to the other side of the block and turned to look at the duo.\nPressing her hand on the coffin, she said, \"Don't panic, I request.\"\nAustin nodded as he tightly held his lover's hand.\nSelner took a deep breath before she gave the lid a slight push.\nThe cover slowly slid towards the duo.\nOnce the lid was completely taken off, Selner nodded toward them to look inside.\nAustin steeled his nerves and approached the coffin...only to feel his mind turning numb and the person losing strength in his legs.\nValerie's face turned pale when she saw the dead body inside the coffin.\nThe familiar blond boy lay inside the coffin. Dead.\nThe person was extremely identical to the one who was looking at it.\n\"...w-who is he?\" In a trembling voice, Austin asked.\nSelner calmly responded, \"It is you...or should I say your past self.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "It was unbelievable.\nAlthough Austin saw himself inside the coffin, he couldn't believe it. After all, it was a dead body. But how can there be two people with the same identity but one dead?\nAnd what about his past? Austin didn't remember a past in which he was involved with the Demon Lord.\nIt just didn't make sense at all.\nValerie was still quite shaken up, that's why she was breathing deeply to get a grip on her emotions.\nSelner, on the other hand, heaved a sigh seeing the two teenagers panicking.\nShe was expecting something like this to happen, that's why she asked him to take his time to train. She would have met him frequently and told him a thing and two before bringing him here.\nAfter all, knowing nothing about his forgotten past, and seeing his dead body would surely be a little too much.\nHowever, the sudden appearance of the Demon Lord changed everything.\nAll her plans were ruined, and now, she has to put things into motion, way earlier than she assumed.\n\"Austin, Valerie, how about we sit down and talk?\" Selner suggested, and without asking for their permission, she snapped her fingers, and the lid of the coffin retook its previous position.\nThey both looked at the lady, before Valerie asked, \"Tell me, Selner, was it really Austin?\" She dropped formalities since, right now, her mind was converged on what she saw inside the coffin.\nSelner had her eyes closed, her finger pressed against her forehead as she said, \"I will tell you everything but let's just change the location. My presence here would attract attention, and I don't want anyone else to know about this place.\"\nAustin took a deep breath. He knew that panicking here would only trouble Selner. And since she wasn't resisting answering them, he decided to behave calmly.\n\"Okay, let's go.\" He held Valerie's hand and gave her a brief squeeze. He could feel how restless the girl was at the moment—after all, seeing the person she loved dead before her would surely unsettle her heart.\nValerie wordlessly agreed to him and turned her eyes toward Selner.\nSelner asked them to extend their Shards again before the trio disappeared from the field.\n°°°°°°°°\n\"Guh ...\" Austin winced as he felt the familiar sensation inside his stomach. However, this time it was bearable and didn't usher him to buy a potion.\nHe checked on Valerie and found she didn't react at all.\nThe mental shock she felt just now, suppressed her physical pain.\nThey were back in the Selner's office, in the Headquarters of the Union Council.\nSelner offered them some water and hot tea to soothe their stomach.\nAustin accepted the water as he and Valerie sat down side by side.\nThe office was silent as the previous time.\nNo one came to disturb them, since Selner's magic was not detectable to them.\nShe can come and go anytime she wants without getting noticed.\nThe room was engulfed in silence only for a few moments before the older violet-haired finally began,\n\"I am a Witch, one of eight who exist beyond the grasp of time. Unlike ordinary humans, we wield sorcery that defies all limits—magic unattainable by any mortal.\"\nAlthough they didn't know why she was talking about herself, the duo were mature enough to not show impatience and silently waited.\n\"I was also alive at that time when the Demon Lord used to rule over the world. However, since our race never interfered with worldly affairs, neither we were ever bothered nor we ever tried to fight against the Demon race.\"\nHeaving a sigh, she said, \"However, one of my sisters and I grew weary of how the Demons treated humans. We witnessed everything—the cruelty, the suffering, the inhuman torment they endured. For them, death was often the only mercy. I have seen it all.\"\nResting her hands on the table, she revealed, \"However, we couldn't intervene in their war alone. Though a few warriors broke free from their restraints and dared to stand against the evildoers, they, too, fell in the end. Take Hero Kane, for example—he fought, he resisted, yet even he couldn't change their fate.\"\nThat statement made both teenagers shocked, \"Wait! Hero Kane was defeated?\" Austin asked in a high-pitched voice. However, it was natural since every book and every praise he heard about the Hero only told how gallantly he defeated the Dark Lord.\nAnd now, this lady relayed that Hero Kane lost a thousand years ago.\nSelner responded in a solemn voice, \"You can discard my words as nonsense, it's up to you. But I have no reason to defame a person who has nothing to do with me.\"\nAustin's excitement receded as he settled back in his seat. Maybe the stress he has been accumulating has sent his emotions into haywire.\nValerie calmly asked, \"Then who defeated the Demon Lord a thousand years ago?\"\nSelner looked down, as she continued, \"Although Kane failed, his efforts weakened the Demon Lord enough for several human societies to break free. As for me, I played a crucial role in disrupting the time flow between the two realms, giving humanity the precious time it needed to regain its footing and thrive.\"\nSelner sighed, \"I hoped that another warrior like Kane would arrive so they could weaken the Dark Lord further. Defeating Astaroth never crossed my mind...until he appeared.\"\nSelner's eyes brightened slightly, her lips extending in a soft smile as she said, \"An aloof warrior who held strength beyond mortal's grasp. His Shard was the true tool of destruction—a weapon that can slash anything. A true genius by birth and a warrior at heart. Before him, I had never seen a man shining so brightly. He was the radiance of hope for the humans—their symbol of peace.\"\nValerie and Austin held their breath...since they somehow guessed the identity of the person, even though it didn't make sense.\nAnd as they thought, Selner turned her eyes toward the blond Prince before revealing,\n\"It was you, Austin Eryndor—the one who grew weary of a mundane life and sought me out, demanding a reversal of time just so you could face the Demon Lord at his peak.\"\n\"....\"\nWhen was Austin such an overpowered character?\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- This chapter was short but this seemed the perfect ending.

      "content": "Many things didn't make sense.\nWhen was Austin that strong? A born talent? Strong enough to challenge the Demon Lord at his prime?\nThis didn't make sense since even the original version of Austin didn't show any talent worth being a Hero. It has always been Rhea—the being who was called the reincarnation of Hero Kane.\nThen how...\n\"Madame Selner, can you start from the beginning?\" Valerie asked. Somehow, she didn't find it ridiculous after hearing the lady.\nSelner exhaled a deep breath as she said, \"Astaroth is an ancient evil born from the malice of the deities, a being shaped by the darkness of the immortals. Along with his immense strength, he possesses a wealth of experience that makes him all the more formidable.\"\nTaking a pause, she added, \"With that experience, he got a hold on a technique which provided him the opportunity to never meet his end.\"\nWith her expression turning grim, she added, \"He could split his soul into multiple bodies, and Austin knew it. That's why he sought to travel to the past—to hunt down and destroy most of Astaroth's bodies before they could grow stronger. He was certain that Astaroth would keep a part of himself in hibernation to ensure his survival. By wiping out his past existence first, Austin planned to return to the present and end the battle for good.\"\nSelner spoke in a single breath, her brows slightly tense...as if she was upset.\nAustin hesitantly asked, \"But...he failed?\"\nSelner nodded grimly, \"He underestimated the being who was born from the malice of deities. Although Austin was able to defeat the Astaroth of the past, he received severe lethal damage in return as well—leaving him with no option but to take his last breath in the past.\"\nValerie was now slightly irritated, \"But how is that Austin related to him? Can you be more clear about it-\"\n\"Austin split his Soul....just like the Demon King,\" Selner spoke in a stronger tone, \"He imitated the technique even though it was forbidden, and divided his soul into four different fragments.\"\nSelner evidently seemed upset about Austin's decision to attempt it, however, if Austing hadn't split his soul at that time, his existence would have perished.\nOn the other hand, Valerie and Austin were in deep contemplation.\nNow...things were making a little sense, even though it still was absurd.\n\"So the dead body we saw is a part of my soul?\" Austin asked, unsurely.\nSelner nodded, \"That's the third part. The fourth part is hidden somewhere by me. However, you are not prepared to consume the last two parts yet.\"\n\"Wait, wait. You said two are left and two are already merged together...but Austin never found the other part of his soul.\" Valerie spoke with utter certainty.\nThat statement made Selner look at Austin with her eyes narrowed.\nAustin was visibly shaken at the gaze as he heard her asking, \"You haven't realized it yet, have you?\"\nAustin nervously muttered, \"I-I have now...\"\nSelner nodded, \"You should tell her as well. The guilt you might be feeling is unwarranted. You never were anyone else but Austin, remember that. You forgot about your real identity but that didn't make you someone else, so stop hesitating and tell her.\"\nAustin took a strong gulp.\nThat was...one hell of a revelation.\nAlthough Selner didn't say anything straightforward, it was apparent to him what she meant by those words.\nValerie kept glancing between the two but couldn't discern what they were talking about.\nIn the end, she trusted Austin to tell her everything later.\n\"When can I absorb the next portion?\"\nSelner didn't contemplate answering, \"Once you reach rank A, your body will be prepared to absorb it.\"\nAustin's eyes turned round, \"That's why you were adamant on me leveling up.\"\nSelner nodded, \"Yes...and the reason your Soul Energy isn't progressing like your other stats, is because your soul is divided into several parts.\"\nIt was amusing that despite sounding so absurd, it all made sense.\nThe reason why despite trying so hard, his Soul Energy never progressed was because his Soul was limited to a certain growth. He was incomplete since his soul was divided into several fragments.\nAnd he had to prepare his body accordingly to absorb the rest of the components.\n'I don't know how I should feel about it.'\n....\nRegardless of how many questions they might have, Selner brought them back to their starting point.\nBefore bidding her farewell, she told Austin, \"Try to have Valerie's company most of the time, since Astaroth would continue to send Demons your way.\"\nAustin nodded, \"I will be mindful.\"\nSelner soon disappeared, and the duo were left alone.\nValerie was silent for a long time, waiting.\nAustin knew what she wanted to hear.\nMost of the things Selner said, she wasn't able to comprehend.\nHowever, she trusted that her lover would tell her everything.\nRegardless of whatever the matter was, Valerie knew he wouldn't conceal it from her.\nShe trusted him for that.\nAustin didn't turn to look at her when he suggested, \"How about we take a walk?\" It was apparent that he wanted to talk.\nValerie didn't say anything and just held his hand and began walking.\nAlthough they were immensely tired mentally and physically, nothing could stop the girl from listening to the whole truth.\nAustin could feel how eager she was.\nWell, he couldn't blame her. This was about him and his past.\nPreviously, Austin has always been hesitant about his past. He always felt that if Valerie got to know that Austin was once someone else, she would feel betrayed\nAfter all, she was in love with Austin, not a foreign entity taking over his body.\nThe reason why Austin's perception changed toward her...he feared if she knew, she would be hurt.\nHowever, today, Selner gave him the assurance that Austin has always been Austin.\nHis soul was just sent to a different world.\nIt also explains why Luke was so great in any sport he played.\nAnd it also explains why his Shard started to show progression after Luke and Austin became one. It turned out, two fragments just merged and strengthened his soul.\nIt all made sense now.\nHowever, he has to tell everything to Valerie. She deserves to know it.\nHeaving a sigh, Austin finally began, \"Valerie...I have lived another life, but not as Austin....\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Should I skip the conversation and add what effect it had on Valerie? Comment and tell me.\nAnd yes, please check out my new book.",

      "content": "Valerie didn't know what she should think about as of now.\nFor the past twenty minutes, only Austin had spoken, and she listened to him.\nNot a word came out of her because of shock and realization.\nIf anyone else had said something like cross-world travel, she might have found it ridiculous. However, it was the person she trusted the most who relayed about his previous life and the things he faced.\nBy no means was he lying or pranking her since one cannot describe someone's life in such details unless they have lived it.\nAnd there was no reason for Austin to lie to her.\nThen that means...\"You lived your life as a different person for eighteen years...and then woke up in this world and thought you had taken over the person named Austin?\"\nValerie summarised whatever he said until now.\nAustin nervously nodded, \"Yes. I thought I had become one with Austin, but a part of me was still Luke. That's why I hesitated to tell you about it. I thought you might hate me.\"\nValerie paused in her tracks and asked again, \"And you saw this world as a part of a story, right? That's why you knew that day that if I had been blamed and expelled from the Academy, I would have ended up becoming a demon.\"\nAustin slowly nodded, \"Yes...that was the fate that awaited you if I hadn't awoken my second fragment that day.\"\nValerie's eyes were covered with her hair, that's why he couldn't tell what expression she had at the moment.\nWith her head leaning down, she softly asked, \"Can you tell me something honestly...that day, you didn't come to save me because of love...rather, you pitied me, right?\"\nAustin's heart turned heavy at the question.\nHe expected her to ask this\nThat day...when he went to save Valerie from the accusation of attempted murder, he lied to her that he found an old photo album that made him guilty.\nHowever, at that time, Valerie was just a pitiful character in his eyes who was getting falsely accused, and that could have led to an unfortunate future.\nSo...the truth was, \"Yes, I...pitied you that time...\"\n*Release*\nValerie's hold on Austin's hand was released.\nShe slowly looked up at him, her eyes filled with tears, as she asked, \"What about now...i-is it love, or are you still pitying me?\"\n\"Val...\" Austin was rendered speechless; both because of her question and those tears.\nIn these six months, after he woke up in the world, this was the first time Valerie was crying because of him.\nHe dreaded this...he knew that the moment she got to know everything about his past...she would be hurt. That's why, he has been hesitant until now. However, he couldn't have kept it hidden until the end. Especially not after Selner told him that Luke was also a part of Austin.\nThe silence between them was heavy. Austin waited for her to say anything. However, the moment she opened her mouth, something unexpected came out,\n\"I need...some time to think.\" She wiped her tears and added, \"I am not upset with you but I need some time to process everything. So let's talk tomorrow, okay?\"\nAustin parted his lips to say something...to console her or say anything to stop her...however, all he was able to mutter was, \"Okay...\"\nValerie turned around and slowly walked back to the mansion—\n—leaving Austin behind. All alone.\nSeeing her distancing back, Austin felt a very familiar sensation assaulting his mind.\nEvery time his girlfriends broke up with him, it felt the same. The sense of loss and the dread of not recovering from it.\nHowever, this time, things were severely more profound. He felt a part of him was lost seeing her walking away.\nHe didn't know what outcome would this whole situation lead to...however, at the moment, his mind was filled with negativity.\nHe has hurt his beloved. The girl he promised to always keep safe and happy was crying and was in despair because of him.\nAnd that thought continued to gnaw at him, making him empty.\n'Guess...I should do some training...' He mindlessly opened the third dungeon, and dove into it.\n°°°°°°\nValerie returned to her room.\nShe couldn't answer her father properly, and when he asked where Austin was, she said he would be back in a few minutes.\nSo many things were going on in her mind that she barely registered when she fell on her bed.\nHer eyes were still open but she wasn't moving.\nSo many things to process but she didn't have any idea where she should start from.\nShould she prioritize her concern that the Demon Lord would come after Austin? Or should she think about Austin's revelation of him having another life.\nHe...saw her going through a tragic past, which ushered him to take her side at that time.\nHe actually didn't have feelings for her but felt sympathy for her and what she could become.\nAnd all the time, Valerie felt that she was loved by him. That her feelings were reciprocated.\nShe didn't know why but she was feeling sad right now.\nMaybe because of all the things she faced today, she wasn't able to think rationally...otherwise, she would have recalled how she was thankful to Austin for giving attention to her.\nAt that time, she was content with him showing concern for her even if it was fake.\nHowever, right now, her mind was not making sense. Maybe because of the dead body she saw today, her emotional wavelength was all over the place.\nShe couldn't think straight and was experiencing severe despair.\nHolding the ring he placed on her finger, she closed her eyes and fell asleep.\n'I will...think about it once I wake up....'\nNot so long after, Austin was recovered at the gate of the mansion—unconscious and barely breathing.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- This won't continue for long. You know me, I don't like to drag .\nAnd about Valerie's reaction, then I tried to keep her 'human' with that reaction. Thanks for reading. Drop a comment.",

Magmadons swarmed—towering, lava-spitting lizards with claws like jagged blades. The ground trembled as they crawled closer, their molten breath turning the air blistering hot.\nHe had already cut down more than thirty. It wasn't enough.\nA Magmadon lunged, its molten tongue snapping toward his face. SZZZT! Austin twisted just in time, but the heat seared his shoulder, burning through his armor. The pain barely registered before another beast slammed into him from the side. CRACK! His ribs screamed as he crashed into a jagged rock, blood trailing down his lips.\nStill, he didn't stop.\nRaijin pulsed in his hands, lightning coiling around the axe like a living beast.\nA Magmadon roared and lunged—he met it head-on. His axe came down like a thunderclap, cleaving the monster in two. Lava spewed from its corpse, splattering across his leg. The pain was instant, white-hot, but he pushed forward, tearing into the next beast before it could strike.\nAnother clawed at his back—flesh tore, blood splattered, but he just gritted his teeth and kept moving.\nOne. Two. Three more fell.\nHis vision blurred. His body was breaking. But his axe still swung.\nLightning surged, and he became a storm of death—unstoppable, merciless, drenched in the blood of his enemies and his own.\nThe System's warnings kept flashing. His wounds kept piling up.\nAustin didn't care.\nHe just didn't want to think about what had just happened. If he thinks about Valerie and the way she left him, his mind will start repeating the worst outcome of the situation.\nA life without Valerie.\nHe couldn't stop himself from assuming that since Valerie knew about his past and also the fact that he didn't love her all this time and lied to her, she would abandon me.\nTruth be told, he couldn't blame her since this was a betrayal, and she had the right to be angry at him.\nHowever, breaking up with him? No, Austin won't let it happen.\n'There is no life without you, Val…' Just as the realization struck, the System forcibly ejected him from the dungeon, leaving a barely conscious Austin near the entrance of the mansion.\nAustin remained lying there for a few minutes, when suddenly,\n\"Young master?!\" A familiar voice resonated and reached Austin's ears.\nSebastian.\nSebastian came out to check on his Master since the lady(Valerie) returned to the mansion, and without answering anyone properly, she dashed toward her room.\nSebastian was worried since, despite how absurd it sounded, from her behavior, it seemed that Lady Valerie had a fight with her fiancé.\nHowever, Sebastian never expected that in these few minutes, his young master would get into such a state.\nHe hurriedly picked Austin in his arms and headed inside the mansion.\n\"Sebastian?!\" Cedric, who was conversing with Adam, exclaimed upon seeing his son being carried by Sebastian.\nThe butler hurriedly stated, \"He seems exhausted and is barely breathing. We need to call for a healer.\"\n\"I have one at the residence. Bring him to the room, I will call the medic.\"\nSebastian nodded before, under the guidance of a maid, he brought his young master to a room on the ground floor.\n--------**-------\n\"Ah…\"\nValerie woke up in a daze, the dryness in her throat making her swallow hard. A burning thirst clawed at her, urging her to move.\nShe pushed herself up and reached for the glass of water beside her bed. As the cool liquid slid down her throat, her thoughts settled.\nNow that she had gotten a few hours of sleep, her mind was clearer—no longer the chaotic mess it had been before. But clarity came with something else…\nA sharp, unshakable guilt.\nShe could think properly now, and thinking meant remembering—remembering the way she had left Austin alone.\nHer chest tightened.\n'Will he be sleeping…?'\nA desperate urge surged within her—a need to see him, to make sure he was okay.\nWithout hesitation, Valerie got out of bed and made her way toward the door.\nIt was close to dawn, the faint glow of morning barely creeping into the halls. She wasn't surprised to see maids moving about, their quiet footsteps echoing in the stillness. But something made her pause.\nThere was… something odd.\nA few of the maids weren't just passing by—they were circling a specific room, exchanging worried glances as they moved with quiet urgency.\nThe room was close to where the King and Queen were staying.\nA frown marred her face as unease crept into her veins. Her heart began to pound faster.\nHer feet moved before her mind could catch up.\nDown the stairs, past the flickering candlelight, toward that room.\nAnd then she saw him.\nSebastian stood near the entrance, his normally composed expression lined with worry.\n\"Lady Valerie…\" His voice was hushed, cautioning—warning.\nBut she didn't stop.\nShe ignored him, her brows furrowed, and stepped past the threshold.\nAnd then—\n\"…Ah.\"\nThe breath left her lips.\nThe sight before her made her freeze.\nOn the bed lay a single person. His face was unnaturally pale, his chest rising and falling in uneven breaths. Labored. Weak.\nAustin.\nCedric and Sophie turned toward her, their own expressions heavy with unspoken emotions.\nBut Valerie barely saw them. Her world had shrunk to the one person in that bed.\nHer lips trembled as a whisper escaped—fragile, filled with disbelief.\n\"How… did this happen…\"\nSebastian stepped toward her before speaking in a quiet, measured voice.\n\"We found him near the entrance last night. It seems he was involved in a battle... or perhaps it's the aftermath of yesterday morning's confrontation.\"\nThe words barely registered. They felt distant, as if spoken through water.\nValerie's feet moved on their own, bringing her closer to him.\nShe looked at his face.\nPale. Vulnerable. Unmoving.\nHe had been sad when she left him. And now…\nBecause of her.\nBecause of her actions… he ended up like this.\nHer throat tightened painfully.\n\"He has been calling out your name since yesterday...\"\nThe words came from Cedric, his voice hoarse, his exhausted eyes ringed with shadows.\nValerie's breath hitched.\n\"...W-Why didn't anyone wake me up?\"\nHer voice cracked—bewildered, but also carrying a quiet, aching complaint.\nTears welled in her eyes.\n\"You were suffering from a fever,\" came another voice.\nHer mother.\nA warm hand draped over Valerie's shoulder.\n\"That's why we didn't wake you.\"\nValerie bit her lip, frustration, and guilt warring within her. But she wasn't frustrated at them.\nShe was angry at herself.\nHer fingers clenched, trembling slightly.\n\"Can you… leave us alone? Please?\"\nHer voice was barely above a whisper.\nA plea.\nCedric and Sophie exchanged glances before the Queen gave a small nod.\n\"Yes, of course.\"\nOne by one, they left.\nSebastian was the last to linger, hesitating briefly before stepping out.\nWith a quiet click, the door shut behind him.\nAnd then—\nValerie was alone with him.\nValerie sank into the chair beside the bed, her trembling fingers closing around his hand.\nTears continued to slip down her cheeks as she brought his hand near her lips, pressing a gentle kiss against his skin.\n\"Val...\"\nHis voice was weak, barely above a whisper—half lost in a daze.\nHer heart clenched.\n\"I'm here... I'm not going anywhere,\" she assured him softly, her voice thick with emotion.\nAustin's eyelids fluttered open at the sound.\nAnd then, as his vision cleared, he saw her.\nThe face his heart had yearned to see.\n\"Val...\" He called again, this time with more warmth, more relief. But then he noticed the tears streaking her face, and his expression faltered.\nA faint frown touched his lips.\n\"...I made you cry again...\"\n\"No, you didn't.\"\nShe shook her head, gripping his hand tighter.\n\"It's just me... repenting my mistake.\"\nShe blamed herself.\nDespite promising him—swearing—that she would never leave his side, even if the entire world turned against him…\nShe had left him.\nBecause she was weak.\n\"Don't cry, Val… it hurts…\" Austin whispered, his voice strained with pain.\nValerie pressed his warm hand against her cheek, her eyes shimmering.\n\"I won't cry, so please recover soon… I can't describe how much it hurts to see you like this.\"\nAustin let out a soft chuckle, his lips curling into a tired smile.\n\"Sorry... I went overboard. I just... couldn't bear the separation.\"\nA choked sob escaped her.\nShe buried her face into his hands, whispering, \"Why did you do that? Do I not have the right to be upset?\"\nAustin's eyes widened.\nHe hurriedly shook his head. \"No, of course you do! It's just… I dreaded that you—\"\n\"That I might leave you?\"\nHer voice trembled, carrying both hurt and quiet reprimand.\nAustin froze.\nHe had offended her.\nFor a moment, a heavy silence lingered between them.\nThen, without a word, Valerie suddenly got up.\nPanic flashed across Austin's face. Was she really going to leave—?\nBut before he could even lift a hand to stop her, she climbed into the bed beside him.\nHis breath hitched as she wrapped her arms around him, pulling him into her warmth.\nHer soft, familiar scent enveloped him, her steady breath brushing against his skin.\nUsing his arm as a pillow, she whispered, \"I've told you before... Valerie can only belong to Austin.\"\nShe tightened her embrace.\n\"And that fact will never change.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- And there, the fight between the two got resolved.

The room was silent, thick with unease until Cedric finally spoke, his voice low and troubled.\n\"Does Austin always train this hard?\" he asked, turning to Sebastian.\nCedric couldn't shake the image of his son from his mind. Austin had looked utterly drained, barely able to stand. There were no visible wounds, but his whole body radiated pain as if every inch of him was screaming in agony.\nThe healer's words echoed in Cedric's head—Austin had inhaled too much smoke, his body had been pushed beyond its limits, and severe fractures and sprains covered him.\nThere was no permanent damage, but that didn't ease Cedric's worry. If Austin was always pushing himself this far, how long before he broke completely?\nHowever, Sebastian quickly put their worries to rest, shaking his head firmly.\n\"He is a sensible young man, sir,\" he assured them. \"Austin is passionate about his training, but he knows his limits. I have never seen him in such a state after a session before.\"\nThere was no hesitation in his voice. If anyone knew Austin's habits better than his own parents, it was Sebastian. He had watched him grow, observed his discipline, and understood his boundaries.\nAnd if Sebastian was saying Austin didn't normally push himself this far… then—\n\"Was it actually a battle, after all?\" Adam murmured, his voice weighted with concern.\nAustin had insisted he was just doing some light training. But looking at his battered state, it was hard to believe he had ended up like that on his own.\n\"Regardless of whether it was a battle or training... the real question is, how did he end up this injured?\" Cedric's frown deepened as he voiced his thoughts. \"We've all seen Austin fight. He's a careful warrior. If the danger was truly that great, he would have called for help. So why didn't he?\"\nA heavy silence filled the room. Then, Sophie broke it with a quiet but firm voice.\n\"Because he was in pain...\"\nEvery head turned toward the Queen as she spoke, her gaze lowered.\n\"I've seen it before,\" she continued, her voice heavy with understanding. \"Whenever Austin wants to forget something—whenever he wants to escape his thoughts—he fights.\"\nShe lifted her eyes to her husband. \"And I think we all know what could have pushed him this far.\"\n\"He fought with Valerie...\" Anastasia whispered, her concern mirrored in her eyes.\nAfter everything they had been through—after finally beginning to understand each other—were they truly at odds again?\nNo one spoke, but deep down, they all knew. The sight of tears in Valerie's eyes yesterday had been enough to tell them—she and Austin had argued.\nThe reason, however, remained a mystery. They had always seemed so in sync, so perfect together. What could have possibly driven a wedge between them?\nAnastasia, more than anyone, understood how much her daughter adored Austin. And now, after everything—after finally coming together…\n\"I think I'll check on them,\" she suddenly announced, rising from her seat.\n\"Ana, wait—\" Duke Corwon reached out, but she was already halfway across the hall, her steps firm with purpose.\nShe reached the room and peeked inside—only for her eyes to widen.\nSeeing her reaction, the others grew anxious, immediately following her to the doorway.\nBut as they looked inside, the worry etched on their faces slowly melted away, replaced by soft, relieved smiles.\nThere, curled up together, were the two most precious people in their hearts—holding each other close, fast asleep in a quiet embrace.\n\"I think we were worried for nothing,\" Cedric said as he rested his hand on Adam's shoulder.\nThey soon returned to their rooms and got some much-needed rest.\n°°°°°°°°\nValerie stirred in her sleep, a faint frown forming on her face as she sensed a gentle gaze on her. Slowly, her eyes fluttered open…\n…only to be greeted by the most beautiful pair of eyes gazing at her with quiet affection.\n\"Morning,\" Austin whispered, his voice soft. Before she could respond, he leaned in and pressed a tender kiss to her forehead.\nShe closed her eyes, savoring the warmth of his lips.\n\"Why didn't you wake me up?\" she murmured.\nAustin smiled. \"It's peaceful… watching you sleep,\" he admitted honestly.\nAt his words, Valerie inched closer, slipping her arms around him and nestling her head against his chest. The warmth of his embrace, steady and familiar, lulled her into comfort once more.\n\"Are you still upset?\" Austin asked, his voice carrying a hint of hesitation.\nValerie slowly parted her eyes, meeting his gaze. \"No, I'm not,\" she whispered. Then, after a brief pause, she added, \"Did I overreact?\"\nAustin shook his head. \"No, Valerie. If anything, you reacted far less than I expected. I kept something so important from you, even though I always claimed to be honest in our relationship… and then, there was my lie, too.\"\n\"You didn't lie, Austin,\" she murmured. \"I think, deep down, I already knew back then when you defended me against that accusation—that it was pity from your side. But yesterday… my thoughts were all over the place. That's why…\" She sighed before giving him a small smile. \"Well, I'm just glad we talked things out.\"\n\"Of course we had to,\" Austin said without a moment's hesitation. \"Even when I thought about it, I knew—I couldn't even imagine living a single day without you. So, no matter what, I was going to coax you sooner or later.\"\nHis arms tightened securely around her, as if afraid to ever let go of the woman who meant everything to him.\n\"Me too...I also felt quite scared in my room when you weren't around.\" She faintly whispered.\nThe two of them barely spent a few hours apart from each other, yet the sadness in their eyes signified they had been detached for years.\nWith time, emotions often fade, but for them, love only grows—vast and boundless, deepening with each passing day.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "What did Austin find in these few days after hell turned loose at the competition venue?\nFirst, the Generals might have gone through an early awakening and could have crossed the border without getting noticed by the Council security.\nSecond, the great Lord of Darkness, who ruled over the world and enslaved the whole human race a thousand years ago, knows Austin too very well.\nAfter all, Austin was able to eradicate the being a thousand years ago...he still doesn't know how.\nHe couldn't doubt Selner's words as well since the Demon Lord himself shared his thoughts on how he wished to shred Austin into bits and pieces. So no point in pondering there.\nHe has to be wary all the time since the Demon Lord would be sending his forces in his way, every now and then.\nThe third thing was, and the most shocking one, Luke has always been Austin.\nIt sounds crazy, but when Austin, the one who fought with the Demon Lord, was about to die, he split his soul into four different fragments and sent them ahead in time so his future self could do things better.\nAlthough it was just a hypothesis, the only reason one of the fragments that resides inside Luke's body was sent to the other world was to prepare him mentally by giving him information about the world through the game.\nAfter all, now that Austin thinks back on it, he never heard anything about the game from anyone else, so it wouldn't be surprising that it was made just for Luke.\nNow, to get the rest of the two fragments that would allow his soul to grow normally, Austin needs to prepare his body\nSelner said that if he broke into A-rank, she would grant him another fragment which would, apparently, allow his Shard to evolve.\n....\n\"I think we can rely on Madame Selner for this,\" Austin interjected, his confidence unwavering.\nValerie, however, felt a flicker of alarm. He had been mentioning Selner's name far too often in their conversations lately.\n\"She saw Astaroth with her own eyes,\" Austin continued as if to reassure them. \"And given her influence on the Board, they won't be able to ignore her testimony.\"\n\"That depends on whether she's willing to speak,\" Cedric countered, leaning back in his chair.\nA heavy silence followed. Even Austin and Valerie—who knew Selner better than anyone else in the room—couldn't be certain of her allegiance. She had helped them before, but the extent of her support remained unknown.\n\"What do you think, Sebas?\" Cedric finally turned to his most trusted aide.\nSebastian, ever composed, replied without hesitation. \"Our priority should be securing our people. And if possible, we should inform the nation we recently allied with.\"\nCedric raised an eyebrow. \"Drenovar? You think they'll listen?\"\n\"We can use this as an opportunity to strengthen our alliance,\" Adam suggested. \"Besides, we're not spreading baseless rumors.\"\nCedric considered it but remained uncertain. He couldn't be sure about getting involved with Drenovar this soon...but as Adam said, this was a good opportunity to gain their trust.\nAfter a brief pause, his gaze shifted toward Austin. \"And what about you? What's your plan from here on?\"\n\"The academy is suspended for another fifteen days, so I'll return to the capital and train there,\" Austin answered.\nA small smile touched Cedric's lips. \"That's a wise decision.\"\nAfter a brief pause, Valerie spoke up. \"I will accompany him.\"\nShe knew Austin would be targeted relentlessly now. Until he regained the missing fragments of his soul, she needed to stay by his side. Of course, there was a personal reason as well—but the main reason was his safety. Yes, safety!\nAdam let out a sigh, his expression shadowed with disappointment. \"You're leaving so soon?\"\nIt had been over a year since Valerie had last visited home. Her mother had been thrilled at the prospect of her return—preparing her favorite dishes, even planning a small celebration.\nAnd now, she was leaving again.\nAustin glanced at Valerie, wordlessly urging her to stay a little longer. But her resolve was unshaken.\nFor the next few months, she had to be near Austin until he reached A-rank. There would be time for reunions later.\nAustin sighed in surrender before saying, \"Fine. I'll stay here for a few days before leaving.\"\nAdam's shoulders twitched, his expression brightening instantly.\nCedric, on the other hand, silently sulked. His son had just prioritized his father-in-law over his own father.\nWell, at least he would be in the Capital for a few days before heading back to the academy.\nAnd with that, the matter was settled.\n°°°°°°°°°\nFar from where that discussion was unfolding, beyond the Ocean of Separation, lay the accursed Lands of Darkness.\nA vast, barren expanse stretched endlessly beneath a sky choked with crimson fog—a haze thick with the scent of dried blood and the ever-present stench of Dark Water. No forests, no rivers, no life thrived here. The ground was cracked and scorched, littered with jagged rocks that pulsed faintly, as if the land itself were breathing.\nThere were no grand cities, no towering fortresses—only scattered, crumbling shelters that clung to existence like dying embers. The air was heavy, oppressive, filled with whispers that slithered through the wind, voices long lost to time yet still murmuring of suffering.\nAnd at the heart of this forsaken world, a monolithic castle loomed—a citadel of despair, built from obsidian stone that seemed to drink in the dim, reddish glow of the sky.\nInside, within the deepest chamber where no light could reach, a colossal cylindrical tube stood, filled to the brim with swirling Dark Water. Shadows twisted within the murky liquid, their forms writhing like tortured souls. Suspended at its core, pulsing with slow, menacing beats, was a floating heart.\nBlack veins coiled around it, pumping a thick, viscous substance that reeked of corruption. The walls trembled slightly with every pulse, as if the very castle breathed in sync with the heart's rhythm. This was no ordinary organ. It was ancient. Alive. Seething with power that had yet to be unleashed.\nAnd it belonged to the Lord of the Darkness.\nThe one who assessed it was a Demon with black and red skin, a humanoid body, and a long whipping tail behind him.\nThis man was responsible for reviving the Demon Lord...or, to say, providing Astaroth's remaining fragment with enough sacrifices to wake him up from his slumber.\nIt has been over a thousand years since that war, and finally, the moment when the world would greet the darkness again was arriving.\n\"How is he, now?\" Another demon, this one more feminine and with a completely black body and a pair of beautiful violet eyes, appeared beside the one who was assessing the heart.\n\"Lady Zephyr,\" The Demon greeted the heiress of the noble house, \"My Lord is doing better than before. I still am not sure what caused this change but I am delighted to see him getting the motivation to recover.\"\nZephyr grinned, \"Surely, he would be motivated. After all, he found his arch nemesis.\"\nThe healer narrowed his eyes, \"Oh...so the history would repeat itself again.\"\nZephyr snickered, \"A war is approaching, Tanhat; however, this time, we are going to reclaim what once was ours.\"\nIn the past, they lost the battle and the war, which caused the Demon realm to limit their authority, and those maggots received the chance to thrive.\nHowever, things weren't going to stay like this forever.\nThe only warrior who could challenge the Dark Lord was still weak and fragile. He was still far from what he once was. And in this state, it would only take a blow before he would be wiped off the existence.\nZephyr has already assigned a few trusted soldiers under her command who are on their way to lay the perfect trap to capture the warrior.\nAnd once he gets in her grasp, Zephyr would present him to her father as a reunion present.\n'Our resources are limitless, warrior, but your strength is pitifully limited. Let's see, how long you can resist.'\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Drop a comment.",

      "content": "Rhea was back in her hometown.\nAfter visiting the academy, she had been provided transport that brought her here—to Heinveil.\nThe town was under the command of Viscount Rowell, and, as expected from a noble serving under Eryndor, the place was thriving.\nIt had been nearly three years since she last walked these streets. She was only fifteen when she left, and now, at eighteen, she could see how much the town had changed. Or rather, how much it had grown.\nAs she passed through the main street, familiar sights greeted her. The shops were still owned by the same people she remembered, but their signboards were freshly painted, and their decorations had changed. The streets were cleaner, lined with trees on both sides, and she noticed traders and travelers passing by in carts and carriages.\nShould I stop by the hunter's guild? The thought crossed her mind as she walked. She had worked both alone and in teams back when she was here.\nAfter her family was destroyed, she had no one to rely on—except for her Shard. That was why she had thrown herself onto the battlefield at just eight years old. By eleven, she was already a full-fledged warrior, a bronze badge hanging at her waist.\nThere were still many people she knew in this town. Many of them probably still gathered at the guild. But right now, she felt tired. She just wanted to go home and rest.\nJust as she was about to reach her doorstep, a voice called out to her. A familiar one.\n\"Rhea?\"\nShe turned, a smile forming before she even saw who it was.\n\"Aunt Hailey!\"\nThe old woman, her neighbor, stood there, warmth and surprise in her eyes. Rhea didn't hesitate—she stepped forward and wrapped her in a hug.\n\"How have you been?\" she asked, pulling back slightly to look at the woman's face.\nAunt Hailey ran a small bakery, and when Rhea had barely anything—when she lived in the government-funded dormitories—this woman had given her free bread in the mornings so she wouldn't go hungry.\nThose memories made her chest tighten, but not with sadness. With warmth.\n\"I'm home,\" Rhea murmured, squeezing Aunt Hailey's hands.\nAnd for the first time in a long while, it truly felt that way.\n\"You've gotten so thin, child. And your hair—did you grow it out?\"\nRhea pouted playfully. \"Do I not look good?\"\nAunt Hailey chuckled, cupping Rhea's cheek with a warm smile. \"You look like a proper lady now. Rhea has become such a pretty girl.\"\nGrinning at the compliment, Rhea chatted with her for a little while longer. Their conversation drifted from the town's progress to the stray animals that had been causing trouble lately.\n\"You have to come over for dinner, okay?\" Aunt Hailey said as she noticed the line of customers forming at the bakery. With a final smile, she gave Rhea a gentle pat before heading back inside.\nRhea watched her disappear into the bakery, warmth settling in her chest. She had missed this—missed home.\n\"I should freshen up first,\" she murmured, adjusting the strap of her bag.\nWith that, she turned around, eager to finally see her home after years—only to freeze in place.\nA familiar figure stood before her. Spectacles perched on his nose, a soft smile on his face.\nHer heart skipped a beat in surprise.\nProfessor Morkel? Here?\nThe last time she saw him was at the Tournament venue, and with everything happening at the Academy, he had no reason to be in Heinveil.\nShe stepped closer, her brows furrowing. \"Professor Morkel? Why are you here?\"\nHer tone came out sharper than intended, breaking etiquette—but right now, her shock outweighed her manners.\n\"Hello, there,\" He started with a casual greeting before adding, \"I came here to meet you...but don't misunderstand, this is something serious so I had to come in person.\" He clarified; not wanting to appear like Parkinson.\n\"What's the matter, Professor?\" She dreaded if it was about Austin or someone from her friend circle that he had to come here to deliver the news himself.\nHowever, the moment he parted his mouth and words came out, her mind turned blank,\n\"I've found it...the town where you lost your parents after the demon's attack. I've found it...and it still exists.\"\nLowering his head, he asked in a lower tone, \"Want me to take you there?\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nInside the vast indoor training ground built within the premise of the main mansion, two figures could be seen clashing in the middle of the arena.\n*CLANG*\nTheir blades clashed in a rhythmic pattern before they two took some distance, assessed each other, and went in to attack again.\nAustin darted in, his dagger flashing toward Valerie's side. She twisted her spear, knocking his blade away before thrusting at his chest.\nHe ducked, stepping in close, forcing her to abandon the thrust and spin the spear to strike with the shaft. Austin raised his arm, blocking it with the flat of his dagger, then slashed at her wrist.\nValerie pulled back just in time, pivoting on her heel to sweep at his legs. Austin jumped, flipping over her and landing behind her.\nBefore he could press the attack, Valerie twisted, the spearhead already slicing toward his ribs. He barely managed to parry, feeling the force behind her strike push him back.\nAustin took a deep breath and lowered his guard. They have been sparring for the past two hours, and he thought this should be enough as a warm-up before he dives into the dungeon tonight.\nValerie also rested the wooden spear by her side as she asked, \"Want to drink something?\" She said and gestured toward the maid waiting near the entrance.\nShe silently walked towards them and gave them some water and juice—both of them preferred water.\nOnce they caught their breath, Austin turned to her, his voice steady but expectant. \"Be brutally honest with me. Compared to the Austin you fought back at the academy, how strong have I become?\"\nHer Lord had asked for honesty, so she gave it without hesitation. \"Honestly? The current you would defeat your past self in seconds. He wouldn't even realize what hit him.\"\nAustin blinked, absorbing the blunt assessment. \"Ouch… and wow.\" Despite the sting, a grin tugged at his lips—he was genuinely pleased by her words.\nThey sat side by side, both aware of the sweat clinging to their bodies, maintaining a bit of distance out of mutual respect. After a brief silence, Valerie asked,\n\"How strong are your other weapons when you stop holding back?\"\nValerie wasn't just his lover; she was also his keenest observer, someone who analyzed his strengths and weaknesses with sharp insight. Conversations like this were nothing new between them.\nAustin summoned Raijin into his left hand, its presence alone shifting the air around them. \"With this, I can unleash enough magic to take down several D-ranks at once,\" he explained.\nThe massive mace radiated heat, sending faint waves toward her. He clenched the handle tighter before adding, \"I rarely use this one—it's too heavy. But against enemies with thick hides and sheer brute strength… this gets the job done.\"\nValerie studied the weapons as he dismissed them back into his inventory, her eyes thoughtful. Then, she spoke. \"Have you noticed?\"\n\"Hm?\" Austin hummed, turning to her.\nShe met his gaze with a knowing smile. \"You can wield two elements with ease.\"\nAustin hesitated, then exhaled. \"Yeah… I've noticed. But I always thought it was the weapons doing the work.\"\nValerie shook her head, amusement flickering in her eyes. \"Weapons don't decide how they're used, Austin. You do. And you don't just use both elements—you're compatible with them.\" She leaned slightly closer, voice soft but curious. \"That makes me wonder… what element does your soul truly lean toward?\"\nAustin's heart beat a little faster, both because the thought and her flushed face. Lowering his gaze he muttered,\n'I want to know too.'\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading",

      "content": "Knock.\n\"Yes, come in,\" Adam said, his eyes never leaving the papers in front of him.\nThe door opened, and his wife walked in, carrying a tray.\n\"You've been at this since yesterday,\" Anastasia said, her voice laced with concern as she took in the piles of documents covering his desk.\nAdam hadn't left his office since breakfast, and now, the sun had long since set.\n\"It's only for a few days,\" he replied. \"I need to map out the areas that need extra protection and decide which units to send to the Capital.\"\nOther than the King, Adam was the only one who knew what was coming. A war was on the horizon, and for now, only two nobles were aware.\nOf course, the King would inform the others soon, but that wouldn't lessen Adam's burden.\nAs a Duke overseeing a vast region, he already had more responsibilities than most. And with several council seats still vacant, he had to step in as an advisor as well.\nThe weight of it all was unavoidable.\n\"You should see your daughter and son-in-law before they leave,\" Anastasia said softly.\nAdam's quill came to a stop.\n\"When are they leaving?\" he asked, finally turning to her.\n\"Tomorrow morning,\" she answered.\nThere was sadness in her eyes, and Adam reached for her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze.\n\"I know you don't want her to go,\" he said, his voice calm yet understanding. \"But keeping her here wouldn't be fair to her.\"\nAnastasia nodded, but her gaze dropped. \"I know... It's just—when I think about what she has to face—I can't help but feel that her strength is more of a curse than a blessing.\"\nValerie was extraordinary. Her talent, her power—nations would do anything to have her on their side. Even the Union Council would welcome her without hesitation.\nShe had the potential to become the strongest warrior in the world.\nBut with that title came a crushing responsibility.\nWhen disaster struck, people would look to her, believing that as long as Valerie stood, everything would be okay.\nShe never spoke of it, but Anastasia could tell—her daughter felt the weight of those expectations. She was only seventeen.\nAt that age, Anastasia's biggest worry had been embroidery lessons.\nBut Valerie? She carried the fate of an entire race on her shoulders. When the war began, she would be the one leading the charge, standing at the front while thousands placed their hopes in her.\nAnd if she failed, none of her efforts would matter.\nPeople would remember only the failure.\nAnastasia swallowed the lump in her throat. \"I just want her to be happy.\"\nJust then—\nKnock.\nAdam looked up. \"Who is it?\"\n\"It's me. Austin.\"\nThe voice on the other side made both Adam and Anastasia pause in surprise.\nAdam didn't hesitate for long. \"Come in.\"\nThe doors opened, revealing a young man with a natural, effortless charm. Dressed in brown ankle-length trousers and a crisp white shirt, Austin carried himself with quiet confidence, though his slightly disheveled hair hinted at the long day behind him.\n\"Sorry for disturbing you two,\" he said, offering a respectful bow.\n\"It's no trouble. I was taking a break anyway,\" Adam responded. Then, gesturing toward a chair, he added, \"No need to stand. Sit.\"\nAustin gave a small nod and took the seat, sliding into place with a composed grace. Resting his hands on his lap, he took a steady breath before speaking.\n\"I wanted to talk to you both before leaving.\"\nAdam and Anastasia exchanged a glance, sensing the weight behind his words.\n\"Is something the matter, son?\" Adam asked.\nAustin's hands tightened slightly, but his voice remained steady. \"I wanted to apologize... for how I treated Valerie.\"\nAnastasia blinked, momentarily caught off guard. \"But you've been treating her well—\"\n\"Not now,\" Austin interrupted gently. \"I mean in the past.\"\nHe exhaled, gathering his thoughts. \"I neglected her. I said things no one should say to someone they care about. And Valerie... she's not just my fiancée. She's my best friend. Treating her that way was unforgivable.\"\nA deep silence settled between them.\nAdam and Anastasia understood immediately. They hadn't forgotten the distance Austin had put between himself and Valerie after Aiden's return.\nThey remembered the hurt in Valerie's eyes, the quiet suffering she endured when Austin turned away as if she didn't exist.\nIf not for Valerie's unwavering feelings, Adam might have ended the engagement himself. After all, his daughter's dignity meant more to him than any political tie to the royal family.\nAustin lifted his gaze, his voice raw with honesty. \"I can't undo the past… I can't erase the pain she felt or the tears she shed because of me. I don't deserve forgiveness for that. But what I can do is make sure Valerie never goes through that kind of pain again.\"\nA voice cut through his resolve.\n\"She will.\"\nThe words came from Adam, and they hit like a cold slap, startling both Austin and Anastasia.\nAustin turned, his breath caught in his chest. He had expected resistance, maybe doubt—but not this.\nAdam met his gaze, unwavering. \"Not the pain of being ignored by the man who was supposed to love her… but the pain of losing the one she does love.\"\nThe weight behind those words crushed into Austin, shaking him in a way he hadn't expected.\nAnastasia looked alarmed, her lips parting as if to protest, but Adam gently squeezed her hand, stopping her before she could speak.\nThen, his expression turned sharper, his voice quieter, but no less firm. \"Austin, we both know the Demon Lord is after you. You haven't told us why—but since even the Evil Deity himself confirmed it, I have to believe it's true. Your life is surrounded by danger.\"\nHe leaned forward, resting his arms on the table, his gaze locked onto Austin's.\n\"So tell me… wouldn't it be better to let go of something that could end up breaking her heart if the worst happens to you?\"\nAustin sat there, shoulders heavy with the weight of the conversation.\nYet, not once did his eyes waver—not with doubt, not with fear.\nHe took his time before speaking, not to hesitate, but to make sure every word carried exactly what he meant.\nStill, no matter how much he tried to temper his tone, his voice came out sharper than intended.\n\"I can't leave her… not because of you, not because of the Demon Lord.\" His gaze was steady, unwavering. \"I am sorry if I sound rude, but a life without Valerie is not worth living in my eyes. So unless you want me to throw myself to give the other side, I can't tolerate separation from the only girl my heart has ever come to love.\"\nAnastasia's eyes turned moist upon hearing those words while Adam's lips curled in a smile.\nGetting up he approached Austin.\nThe blond teenager also got up, feeling slightly ashamed that he lost his temper in front of Valerie's father just now.\nHowever, he didn't need to worry because Adam just wanted to see that reaction.\nInching closer to Austin, the man unexpectedly hugged his son-in-law, before he said,\n\"Take care of my daughter, Austin.\"\nAustin was flustered but he returned the hug and assured him, \"I will, father.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading..",

After all, there was someone waiting for him—someone he needed to coax.\nNear the entrance of the mansion, Valerie's mother held her in a tight embrace, eyes glistening with unshed tears. Valerie gently patted her back, feeling both warmth and guilt.\nA short distance away, Adam was speaking with Austin, discussing possible checkposts they might encounter and how to handle any trouble on the road. Even though it wasn't necessary, Adam had still assigned a few soldiers to escort them to the capital.\n\"You need to be extra cautious now,\" Adam warned. Austin gave a small nod, knowing there was no denying that.\nThen Adam turned to Valerie. \"Val, why don't you visit your master? His estate is along the way, and I believe he's home.\"\nAustin blinked in surprise before recalling that Count Everhart had once been Valerie's mentor.\nValerie hesitated. \"I'll think about it,\" she murmured.\nAfter exchanging a few more words with her parents and accepting the lunch boxes her mother had lovingly packed, they boarded the carriage.\nAs the wheels began to turn, Anastasia and Adam waved, their smiles tinged with longing. Valerie and Austin waved back, mirroring their expressions.\nFor a while, they sat in silence, listening to the rhythmic sound of the horses' hooves against the road. Then, Austin gently placed his hand over Valerie's.\n\"Are you sad?\" he asked.\nFeeling the warmth of his touch, she sighed and leaned back. \"I just feel bad for Mom… She wants to keep me home forever.\"\n\"That's only natural,\" Austin said softly. \"We'll be finishing our second year in another month. Maybe you could take a long vacation and spend time with them?\"\nValerie turned toward him, puffing out her cheek slightly. \"You don't want to spend vacation with me? I even bought a swimsuit…\"\nAustin stiffened, his throat suddenly dry. The mere thought of Valerie in a swimsuit sent heat rushing to his face. He swallowed hard.\n\"W-Well, vacations are long, so we can definitely—\"\n\"No, I'll spend it with my family.\" Valerie crossed her arms and huffed in mock stubbornness.\nAustin let out a dramatic sigh, then leaned in with a teasing smile. \"I was just joking. There's no way I'd miss spending quality time with my lovely wife.\"\nValerie wasn't truly upset, but when he called her his wife, her heart softened. She melted into his embrace, letting him hold her close.\nAfter a quiet moment, Austin whispered, \"Val… do you want to visit your teacher?\"\nCount Everhart's estate was along the way, so it wouldn't take much effort to stop by.\nValerie hesitated. \"I haven't seen him since I started at the academy. He might be angry with me.\"\nAustin chuckled. \"That's possible. But if you don't go, wouldn't that be unfair to him?\"\nShe lowered her gaze, deep in thought. She didn't talk about her teacher much, but Austin knew how much she respected him. Count Everhart had been her first mentor—the one who taught her combat, guided her through hardship, and witnessed her grow stronger. Under his care, she had undergone all three of her evolutions. He had played a crucial role in shaping her into who she was today.\nAustin gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. \"I think we should go.\"\nThe last traces of hesitation faded from Valerie's face. If her Lord had decided, then there was no need to second-guess.\n\"Okay,\" she said with a nod, and the carriage continued down the road.\n°°°°°°°°°\nIt took them about three hours to reach another town—Habesberg.\nThis town fell under Count Everhart's jurisdiction, and the banners of both Habesberg and Eryndor fluttered in the wind, marking the territory.\nHabesberg was alive with energy, its streets filled with the scent of rich spices. The air carried the warm notes of cinnamon, pepper, and saffron, mingling with the chatter of traders from distant lands. Stalls lined the roads, overflowing with colorful herbs, dried fruits, and fragrant oils. Merchants haggled with eager buyers, their voices blending into the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carts and the rustling of woven sacks.\nAs their carriage passed a cluster of spice shops, Valerie's small nose twitched. She instinctively covered her mouth, but—\n\"Achoo!\"\nA tiny sneeze escaped her.\nAustin, who had been idly watching the passing scenery, blinked. A sweet, almost unbearable aggression bubbled inside him.\n\"You… just sneezed?\" His voice held a mix of surprise and fascination.\nValerie wiped her nose with a handkerchief, suddenly feeling oddly self-conscious. Especially under the way he was looking at her—with such bright, eager eyes.\nShe gave a small nod.\nAustin raised a finger, his expression serious. \"Can you sneeze once more?\"\nValerie stiffened. \"W-What?\"\n\"It was adorable,\" he declared without hesitation.\nHer face instantly turned red. \"M-My sneeze?\"\n\"Yes. It was.\"\nBefore she could react, Austin pulled her into his arms, squeezing her tightly.\nIt was the same kind of instinctive affection one felt when seeing a small, fluffy animal or a beloved pet after a long time.\nValerie had no idea why she was being showered with so much attention, but since it was from her favorite man, she simply closed her eyes and allowed herself to be pampered.\nNot long after, the carriage slowed to a stop before a grand mansion, its white and blue façade gleaming under the midday sun.\nWith a quiet sigh, Valerie and Austin reluctantly parted from their embrace and stepped out.\nAs they approached the main gate, Valerie gestured ahead. \"Here, in—\"\nBefore she could even retrieve her identification card, a voice called out from beyond the gate.\n\"Welcome, Lady Corwon.\"\nA man approached, his presence prompting the guards to swing the gates open without hesitation.\nValerie smiled. \"Sir Glade.\"\nAustin raised a brow at the blue-haired man, something about him felt oddly familiar.\nThen the man's gaze landed on him. \"Ah… are you the Royal Highness, Sir Austin?\"\nIt wasn't hard to guess—anyone standing so closely beside Valerie, speaking so casually with her, had to be her fiancé.\nAustin nodded and extended his hand. \"Good afternoon. I am Austin Eryndor.\"\nGlade accepted the handshake with a firm grip. \"A pleasure to meet you, Your Highness. I am Glade Everhart. My younger brother has spoken of you.\"\nAustin's lips curled in amusement. \"So, you're Elion's brother.\"\nGlade grinned. \"Indeed. I hope he hasn't given you too much trouble at the academy.\"\nAustin chuckled. \"Not much.\"\nWith the introductions made, Glade gestured toward the entrance. \"Come on in.\"\nAustin and Valerie followed Glade through the halls, the rhythmic tapping of their footsteps filling the quiet space. As they walked, Valerie exchanged a few words with him about the school and her family.\nCount Everhart and Duke Corwon were close, which explained how Valerie had become acquainted with the Count in the first place.\nGlade's voice softened slightly as he asked, \"I heard about the incident. Are you two okay?\"\nThe weight behind his words was clear. Austin and Valerie instantly understood which incident he was referring to.\n\"We managed to get out safely,\" Austin replied his tone even.\nGlade exhaled, relieved. \"Elion told me you both fought against an army. Father was quite pleased, Valerie.\"\nValerie gave a small smile. \"Is he here?\"\n\"He went to the public welfare office but should return in an hour.\"\nShe nodded at the response. With that, Glade led them toward the reception hall.\nIt was an elegant reception with a blue and white color theme.\nResting sofas were around a center table and a soft fur carpet beneath their feet.\nAs the three of them settled, a few maids brought beverages and snacks for the duo.\n\"I assume you still are going with no sugar?\" Glade asked with a smile of amusement.\nValerie nodded, \"I don't like sugary things.\"\nAustin was...slightly surprised that Glade knew so much about Valerie. But then again, she used to come here often for training so they must have gotten acquainted.\n\"How is your training going on? Did you master your Meteor Fall?\" Glade asked, only for Valerie to shake her head in denial.\n\"No, I still...\"\nThey were conversing about things which didn't allow Austin to say anything.\nHearing about the past from Glade, Austin realized how many things he had missed about Valerie.\nThere was a time when Valerie used to be clumsy as well...but unfortunately, Austin was never able to enjoy those moments with her.\n\"I must tell you, Austin, her aim was pretty awful back then.\"\nValerie rolled her eyes, \"Better than Elion, at least.\"\nAustin just smiled in response, when suddenly, a little girl rushed towards them and hugged Valerie.\n\"Big sister!\" She beamed.\nAustin looked at her hair and knew she was Glade's little sister.\n\"How have you been, Kaira?\" Valerie softly patted her back as she asked.\n\"I missed you...\" The little one rubbed her face on Valerie, showing how lonely she was when suddenly, her eyes landed on Austin.\nShe parted from Valerie before turning towards Austin, \"Are you big sister's lover?\"\nAustin nodded softly, \"Yes, I am.\"\nThe little girl's lips extended in a smile as she said, \"Then you must be strong, right? Fight with me!\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Drama loading. Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Kaira had grown surprisingly close to Valerie. At first, she had been distant, almost cold, but somehow, Kaira had broken through that barrier, and before Kaira knew it, they had become friends.\nEven though Valerie didn't speak much about her personal life, Kaira knew she was engaged—to a man who wasn't just her fiancé but also her best friend.\nAt first, Kaira had wanted Valerie to leave him. She had thought Valerie would be better off with her older brother, Glade. But lately, she had been hearing more and more about this man—Austin. Stories of his strength, his bravery. He had been chosen for the tournament, won his first match, and even stood against the demonic army.\nIt had only been a few days, but his name was already spreading across the country.\nThat was why Kaira was so curious. She wanted to see for herself just how strong he was.\n\"You shouldn't bother our guest, Kaira.\"\nA deep, familiar voice cut through the air, making everyone turn. Walking into the room with long, confident strides was a man with wavy blue hair, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\"Teacher,\" Valerie and Austin stood up at the same time, their movements almost synchronized. Valerie, with a rare hint of warmth in her expression, greeted her former mentor.\nCount Aron stopped in front of them, his sharp gaze settling on Valerie. \"I heard about the ambush. You were taken captive?\"\nKaira's eyes widened in shock. She had no idea her sister had been captured by demons.\n\"Yes,\" Valerie admitted, her voice steady. \"They created a barrier to weaken me. But Austin arrived just in time and rescued me.\" Her tone held unmistakable pride—she never missed a chance to praise her Lord.\n\"A barrier, you say?\" Count Aron frowned. \"What kind of barrier was it?\"\nAs someone deeply involved in the capital's strategic defense, he had studied countless demon attack patterns. But he had never heard of a barrier strong enough to suppress an S-rank.\nAustin stepped in. \"It was a Soul-Suppressing Barrier. The stronger your soul energy, the weaker you become inside it.\" His conclusion had come quickly, thanks to the System's analysis during the brief time he spent within it.\nCount Aron's frown deepened. \"A Soul-Suppressing Barrier, huh?\" His voice carried a weight of concern.\n\"This can only mean one thing,\" he continued grimly. \"They've transported Dark Water into this realm in massive quantities.\"\nThe room fell into silence.\nDark Water—the very essence of corruption. It was the bane of soul energy, a substance so vile that even a single drop could twist a person's mind, driving them to madness. If the demons had enough of it to fuel an entire barrier… then the threat was far greater than anyone had realized.\n\"If the barrier suppressed soul energy, then Dark Water must have played a role,\" Count Aron mused, his tone grim.\n\"The Council guards every coast connected to the Demonic Realm,\" Glade added, his expression tense.\n\"Then... either someone is working for the other side, or there's a loophole they're using to smuggle the accursed water.\"\nGlade flinched at those words, and Valerie's eyes widened in shock.\nAustin, however, remained completely still. He already knew the truth.\n'One of the Council Heads is under the control of a Demon General…'\nSpecifically, the Succubus Queen. She had completely ensnared one of the Council's most powerful figures under her charm.\nIn the game, Luke had never encountered the Succubus Queen directly, not until much later in the story. But it had been heavily implied—she was the only General capable of orchestrating something like this. Despite being the weakest among the Demon Generals, she had remained hidden for an unusually long time.\nBut this wasn't a game.\nThis was reality.\nAnd Austin had no intention of waiting for the pieces to fall into place. He needed to act—and for that, he would seek out Selner. She understood the forces at play better than anyone. If there was a way to counter this, she would know.\nBefore he could dwell on his thoughts any further, an excited voice shattered the tense atmosphere.\n\"Dad! I want to spar with him!\"\nKaira had latched onto her father's arm, her eyes gleaming with determination.\nCount Everhart sighed, already familiar with his daughter's stubbornness.\nThen, another voice spoke up.\n\"Let her fight him, Father. You know how she gets when she sets her mind on something.\" Everyone turned towards the teenager as Elion made his way inside the reception.\nKaira's eyes sparkled as she looked at her father hopefully.\nCount Everhart sighed before he looked at Austin saying, \"How is your Shard control?\"\n\"Excellent,\" Valerie responded instead of him; she seemed excited about something.\nAron hummed before he said, \"Then let's do it like old times. To prove your worth to face Austin you must first catch his Shard.\"\nAustin looked lost, unsure of what was happening, so he turned to Valerie for answers.\nValerie spoke gently, \"Whenever someone challenges another, the Teacher first tests the challenger… by making them chase the other person's Shard.\"\n\"He believes that if your control over your Shard is so absolute that your opponent can't even catch it, then you've already won,\" Glade added, folding his arms.\n\"That's right,\" the Count chimed in. \"If your Shard alone can beat your opponent, then there's no need for you to fight personally.\"\nThen he turned his gaze toward the little girl and smiled. \"That's why, Kai-ah… you're ready.\"\nAustin turned toward her too, and to his surprise, Kaira was already tying her long hair into a neat bun, her expression calm and focused.\nHe hadn't expected the test to work this way. But seeing the fire in Kaira's eyes—and the excitement in Valerie's—he decided not to question it. He'd go along with it.\n\"Alright then,\" he said with a half-smile, summoning his dagger.\nIt was small—closer to a knife—but sharp and clean. As he lifted his hand, the blade rose and hovered in the air above it, spinning slightly with his control.\nEveryone grew quiet, anticipation thick in the air.\nAustin raised his hand higher.\n\"Go.\"\nIn a flash, both Kaira and the Shard vanished into a blur of motion.\nKaira dashed forward the moment the Shard shot off. The dagger zipped through the air like a dart, weaving between pillars and over tables with ease.\nKaira gritted her teeth and gave chase, her eyes locked on the flickering blade. She leaped over a chair, twisted past a stunned receptionist, and nearly crashed into a waiter.\n\"Too slow!\" Elion laughed from the back.\nKaira reached out, fingers brushing the dagger's hilt—but it shot upward, dodging her grasp at the last second. She growled and jumped after it, only to land on a couch with a heavy thud.\nThe dagger spun mid-air, taunting her, then darted behind a curtain.\n\"Get back here!\" she shouted, throwing herself after it. The curtain fell over her head.\n\"Still too slow,\" Austin teased, the Shard now zipping in loops above her.\nKaira tore the curtain off and bolted after it again, panting but not giving up. She leaped, ducked, rolled—every move sharp and wild—but the dagger never stayed in reach for more than a second.\nIt danced past her like it had a mind of its own.\nGlade leaned against the wall, arms crossed, amused. \"You're fast, Kaira. But Shard's faster.\"\nShe didn't answer. She just stood there huffing...and then tears welled up in her eyes and she ran away while crying.\n\"You bulllllly!!\" Her cry echoed as she dashed away.\nAustin helplessly looked at his lover and found her smiling in return.\nDid he do something wrong?\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "When Rhea was rescued from her hometown at the age of five, the memories of where she was born had already begun to fade.\nShe could recall her parents, but only in fragments—warm smiles, gentle hands, the sound of laughter echoing somewhere deep in her heart. Maybe it was the shock of the demon attack that shattered those precious moments and buried them too deep to reach.\nAs she grew older, strong enough to stand on her own and defend herself, a quiet longing took root in her heart. She wanted to return to that place—not for any reward or reason—but simply to remember. She believed that if she walked the streets where she once held her parents' hands, the memories might come back.\nBut no matter how hard she tried, Rhea couldn't recall the town. The name of it, the faces, the path back—it was all missing. As if someone had reached into her mind and carefully removed every trace.\nUntil now, all of Rhea's efforts had led to nothing. No matter how far she searched or how many people she asked, there were no answers. She couldn't find where she had lived before becoming a refugee. It was as if the town itself had vanished—not just from maps, but from memory. As if the world had quietly decided to forget.\nSomewhere deep inside, Rhea had already accepted it. The silence, the absence, the way no one ever spoke of it—it all pointed to one thing. The town was gone, wiped away so completely that only the ache it left behind remained.\nBut then, out of nowhere, a ray of hope appeared.\nA man she knew well—someone she trusted—stood before her and quietly said he knew where she came from.\n\"Cadstead...\" Rhea whispered, the name dancing on her tongue like a forgotten melody. It felt strange, yet familiar—like something pulled from the corners of a long-lost dream. She remembered how she used to fumble the word, no matter how many times her father patiently repeated it. And yet, the moment it passed her lips, she knew. This was it. The name of the place where her story began.\nAs the carriage rolled forward, the world outside passing in gentle blurs, she sat beside him in silence for a moment. Then, with wide, searching eyes, she turned to him. \"How did you find out about it?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, heavy with wonder and disbelief.\nMorkel let out a quiet sigh, leaning back in his seat. His gaze drifted upward for a moment before he answered, his voice low and a little hesitant. \"You were talking about it with Parkinson a few months ago. I was there too... I happened to overhear the conversation.\"\nHe didn't mention the part where he had chosen to eat in the common hall only because he saw her heading there. He didn't tell her how he'd listened more closely than he should have, holding on to every word she shared.\nRhea gave a small nod, not pushing further. Her eyes followed his as they turned to the window.\nThe scenery of Heinveil passed by in soft, fading colors. It made her feel a little heavy inside. She had only just arrived, and already she was leaving. The people here were kind, and the air was gentle—but memories pulled stronger than comfort ever could.\nShe didn't have many days off from the academy. And between staying in the peace of the present or chasing the pieces of her past, Rhea had made her choice.\nShe would go. Even if all she found was silence, she needed to stand on the soil where her life had begun.\n\"It'll take only half a day to get there,\" Morkel said gently. \"After that, you can come back and spend a few more days here before heading to the academy. And if you want to stay longer... I can send a letter on your behalf. You won't get in trouble.\"\nHe had been watching her closely, reading the silent tug-of-war playing out in her eyes. That quiet struggle between duty and longing. It moved him more than he let on.\nThey were nearing the end of the academic year. Most lessons had already wrapped up, and apart from the final reward ceremony and the farewell celebration for the graduating seniors, there wasn't much left. If Rhea wanted, she could skip them without much consequence. And with Morkel's influence, no one would question her absence.\nHearing his offer, Rhea turned her gaze toward him, a flicker of surprise in her expression. \"Why are you helping me this much, Professor? I'm not the top student… and I don't come from some noble family.\"\nMorkel couldn't help but smile at that. There was something in her voice—honest, unsure, a little guarded.\nHe leaned forward, resting his arms on his knees, and looked straight at her. \"Because once, you saved me from giving up on my dream. And now... I'm just returning the favor.\"\nFor a moment, her breath caught. She remembered. That day when she bumped into him outside the staff hall and saw the resignation letter in his hand. She had spoken so freely then, unaware of the weight her words carried, telling him how his lectures made magic feel alive again, how she looked forward to his classes more than any other. She hadn't realized it was enough to make him stay.\n\"Is that so?\" she asked softly, a shy smile curving her lips.\nMorkel didn't reply. He only smiled again, a quiet, knowing smile, and turned his eyes to the changing view outside the carriage window.\nHe told her it was just a favor returned. But the truth was much deeper than that—one he kept tucked inside his heart. He was doing all of this not out of duty… but out of love. The kind that grows slowly, gently, and quietly changes everything.\nBut naturally, telling her that would surely creep her out.\n'I don't want your affection Rhea...just seeing you smile beside me is hefty for me.'\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nThere was a room in the royal palace that seldom opened.\nA single room where servants aren't allowed to enter regardless of the reason.\nEven though in the room a royalty resides, it is forbidden for them to disturb her.\nThe youngest heiress of the Eryndor family and the only Princess, Averis von Eryndor.\nIt has been over four years since she went to her hibernation.\nHer meals are kept before her door every single day, and at the end of the day, the maids come to take the empty plates.\nShe denies the help to clean her room and even rejects her parents' request to let them see her.\nAlthough she leaves her room once in a while, no one sees her generally. After all, she left under pitch darkness.\nJust like every day, today as well, Averis was sitting by the window and looking at the grand entrance of the palace.\nHer long silver hair was sprawled on the bed. Her light blue eyes traced the carriages that came and went.\nEven though she has forbidden any servant from entering the room, she has kept it nearly tidy and clean. All her clothes were washed, too, and not a speck of dust could be seen anywhere.\nThere was a wide range of books stored on the bookshelf, which she had already read. There were a few potion-making materials as well, but she long realized she didn't have the talent of a potion-maker.\n\"It is going to be winter soon...\" Averis muttered under her breath as she decided to take out her winter wear from the trunk.\nJust as she got up from the bed, she heard,\n*Knock*\n\"It's me, Averis. Open the door.\"\nShe jolted at that voice...i-it can't be....\nThat voice...why is he here?\nHer legs began to tremble and her eyes wavered as she realized who was standing on the other side.\nBut why would he come here?! She was nothing to him! After so many years, why did he come here?!\nAverish clenched her fist and decided to remain silent, so he goes away. However,\n*CREAK*\nMuch to her shock, the lock of the door cracked as the person on the other side pushed it.\nAveris remained standing with her eyes parted wide as the door slowly opened, the huge barricade completely destroyed before the person from the side came into her view.\nHe looked a bit different...no more gloom over his head, no more anger in his eyes, and he extruded a strong presence as well. However, despite all that, there was no denying that the person in front of her was the reason why she locked herself up.\n\"Averis...\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "[A few minutes ago]\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Cedric asked, his brows furrowed with concern.\nAustin and Valerie had only arrived half an hour ago, and now his son was asking to see his younger sister.\nIt had been a long time since Averis locked herself in that room—ever since the argument with Austin. No matter what Cedric and Sophie tried—gentle coaxing, firm boundaries, quiet patience—nothing worked. She either shut the door in their faces or threatened to disappear.\nShe had even said she would leave the capital if they didn't give her space.\nCedric couldn't bring himself to force her into anything. He wasn't the kind of father who would lock his daughter up just to keep her from running. So he let her be, even if it hurt.\nAustin knew everything. He understood the reasons behind her silence, the weight behind her distance—but he never tried to fix it. For the longest time, it felt like Averis had simply vanished from his world.\nAnd yet, once upon a time, they had been inseparable.\nThey shared laughter, secrets, and dreams... and then one day, as if those years meant nothing, they became strangers under the same roof.\nAveris had once been the apple of Austin's eye.\nHe doted on her, protected her, teased her just enough to make her laugh—and then, one day, everything changed.\nCedric never learned the full story. Austin never talked, and Averis never let anyone in. But from the way Austin avoided her, from the way his eyes dimmed whenever her name came up, Cedric could tell—it wasn't just one-sided pain. Whatever happened between them, Averis must have said something too.\nAt the time, Cedric had been overwhelmed with responsibilities, especially with Aiden needing his guidance. He didn't have the space to properly step in or settle things between his two children. It was one of his quiet regrets.\nBut now, finally, Austin was taking the first step.\n\"I wouldn't have said it if I wasn't sure, Father,\" Austin said calmly, though something in his voice trembled. \"Is she in her room?\"\nCedric gave a slight nod. \"She is... Well, good luck.\"\nThere was a hesitation in his voice, the kind that only a father would carry when he knew a storm might be coming. Averis had bottled her emotions for years—hurt, anger, disappointment—and Cedric wasn't sure how she would react.\nStill, deep down, he hoped they could find their way back to each other.\nWithout another word, Austin and Valerie rose from their seats and made their way up to the third floor, where Averis's room was.\nAs they walked through the quiet hallway, Valerie glanced at him. \"Are you nervous?\" she asked, her voice light, but her steps slow. Then she added with a small, nervous laugh, \"I am, truth be told.\"\nAustin let out a soft chuckle. \"Why are you nervous?\"\n\"Because I know how much you adore Avy,\" Valerie said, her voice soft with warmth. \"We used to play together so much.\"\nA tender smile tugged at her lips as memories flickered to life—days filled with laughter, games, and a world that felt small, safe, and full of wonder.\nBack then, their lives revolved around nothing but joy.\nEverything changed when Aiden came into the picture. And slowly, that small world began to unravel.\n\"Valerie…\" Austin murmured, his gaze lowering slightly. \"I know she'll reject me at first. But I also know... I can coax her. Somehow.\"\nThere was certainty in his tone, but not arrogance—only hope. A hope built on reflection and regret.\nHe exhaled, the breath shaky as it slipped past his lips. \"Before seeking forgiveness, you have to understand your fault. And I do. I know exactly what I did.\"\nHis voice grew quiet, the edges touched by sorrow.\nJust like Valerie, Averis had always been his anchor. Someone he leaned on, someone who looked up to him. But he hadn't treated her feelings with care. In a moment of frustration, he'd said things he could never take back—words that left a scar on someone too young to carry such pain.\nValerie reached out and gently squeezed his hand.\n\"Whatever happens in there,\" she whispered, \"please don't hide it from me.\"\nAustin looked at her, and for a second, the tension in his chest loosened. He gave her a fond smile, his fingers returning the gentle squeeze.\n\"You know I won't,\" he replied softly.\nAnd together, they stepped off the final stair, arriving at the hallway that led to Averis's door.\nValerie stepped down from the stairs, giving him one last look of encouragement before disappearing around the corner.\nAustin stood still for a moment, staring at the door across from him.\nThen, slowly, he walked toward it and raised his hand.\nKnock.\n\"It's me, Averis. Open the door,\" he called out, voice calm but firm.\nSilence.\nOf course, she wouldn't open it. He knew she was in there—he could feel it, sense it—but she was probably hoping he would give up and walk away.\nBut he wasn't here to give up.\nAustin pressed his palms against the door and began to push, the wood groaning under his force.\n\"Your Highness!\" a maid gasped nearby, stopping in her tracks as she saw the First Prince forcing the door open.\nShe looked torn between duty and disbelief. The order to never disturb the Princess had come straight from the royal family—but the one breaking that sacred rule was the very brother she had shut out, the firstborn of the Crown.\nAustin didn't even glance at her. The lock cracked under pressure, and with a final push, the door gave in.\nAnd there she was.\nThe girl who once trailed after him with wide eyes and soft laughter. Her silver hair—like their mother's—fell over her shoulders, and her eyes, so similar to their father's, widened in shock. Her lips parted slightly as if caught between surprise and disbelief.\nAustin stepped into the room, wordless. He gently closed the door behind him—though the damage made it hang awkwardly—before walking toward the nearest sofa.\nHe didn't speak just yet.\nBecause for the first time in years, he was standing face-to-face with his little sister.\nAnd the air between them was thick with everything they had left unsaid.\nAustin sat down quietly, leaning back slightly on the sofa as his eyes settled on the girl standing across the room.\n\"Hey, Avy. How have you been?\"\nHis voice was calm—too calm, given the weight between them. He didn't expect warmth. He didn't expect forgiveness. He just wanted to start.\nAveris stood frozen for a moment, the silence between them stretching unbearably long.\nThen—\n\"Get out!\"\nHer voice snapped like a whip, sharp and laced with fury.\nHer eyes weren't teary—they burned. Red with rage, not sadness. Her mana spiked violently, and the room instantly dimmed as her aura surged out uncontrollably.\nAustin didn't flinch. He could sense it clearly—she had gone through at least two evolutions. And more than that, the faint but unmistakable bloodlust in her magic spoke volumes. She had been fighting...killing. Often.\nStill, he met her glare with steady eyes and spoke, not to provoke, but to force open old wounds they never addressed.\n\"You're unwanted, just like me… no, worse. You're a girl. So you're not even considered a candidate for the throne.\"\nAveris froze.\nHer pupils trembled.\nThose words—exactly what he once spat in her face—came crashing back with cruel clarity.\nAustin got up and took a step forward, his voice quieter now, but no less sharp.\n\"You're not needed. Not by me. Not by anyone. Why do you keep pestering me? Just kill yourself.\"\nAveris screamed.\n\"Why are you repeating all those things!\" Her voice cracked, and the room shook as the floor beneath them trembled with her fury. Mana burst from her like a storm breaking its seal.\nOutside, the maids scattered in panic.\nValerie, still lingering at the stairwell, clenched her fists hard enough that her knuckles paled. Her teeth sank into her lower lip. She wanted to run in—but she didn't want to come between them.\nInside, despite the suffocating pressure, Austin remained unfazed.\nHe walked toward Averis slowly, unshaken by the storm she raged around her.\nHis voice softened.\n\"I just wanted to remind you what I said... how deeply I hurt you. So you'd remember exactly how angry you were at me. Because you deserve to feel that anger. You deserve to scream, to hate me.\"\nHe stopped just before her.\n\"And I needed you to know—I haven't forgotten a single word I said. I live with them every day.\nTears build up in her eyes, but she refuses to cry and give in\nShe pushed him away using Soul Energy and Austin was flung back, colliding against the wall.\nAveris glared at him, and with pure hatred in her voice, she said, \"You are no one to me!\"\nAustin took a deep breath and pushed himself away from the wall.\nHe didn't look offended. No anger, no frustration, just pure warmth in his eyes, which dared to melt her anger.\nHowever, Averis held her stance and heard him say, \"You can push me again or slap me if you want. But unless you forgive me, I am not leaving.\"\nAveris gritted her teeth. What does he think of himself?! All these years he neglected her. And now that he has gained his family back and made some reputation in the world, he thought he would say sorry, and she would forgive him...\n*Sniff* *Sniff*\nTears welled up in her eyes as large droplets of tears began to slide down her eyes and the girl started weeping.\nAustin released a soft breath and advanced toward the little girl.\nBringing his arms around her frame, he gently hugged her.\n\"D-Don't touch me *sniff* I hate you...I hate you...you are so mean...I only wanted...*sniff*..to help you...\"\n\"I know...I was an idiot to reject your kindness back then.\" His voice turned heavy as he closed his eyes and softly rubbed her back.\nThere were many things she wanted to say and complain about...however, in the familiar warmth of her brother, she couldn't continue.\nIn the end, she fell asleep while crying.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Austin was an a**hole to both girls who cared so much about him. His sister hasn't forgiven him yet. Austin has to coax her a lot now.\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "Adam let out a long sigh as he sat alone in his office.\nIt had been this way ever since Valerie and Austin left.\nBack when they were around, Adam didn't pay much attention to work. Most of his time was spent with the two of them—laughing, talking, just being together. Now, the silence felt heavier than ever.\nIt had been a long time since he'd had a chance to truly be with his family.\nHe heard everything from Valerie—what she'd gone through, the things she'd achieved, and even the struggles she tried to hide. And every time she spoke, he could feel how much he had missed.\nTo be honest, after what happened back at the academy, Adam had nearly lost hope of making things right with his daughter. The distance between them felt too wide, the wounds too fresh. But Austin… Austin made it possible.\nHe talked to Valerie and helped her understand Adam's side—and slowly, the wall between them began to crumble.\nAnd the quiet worry Adam carried about Austin's feelings for his daughter? That vanished too. One day, without hesitation, Austin looked him in the eye and said he couldn't bear being apart from Valerie.\nFrom that moment on, Adam knew. He had someone who truly loved his daughter by her side—and somehow, that made everything feel a little easier.\n\"Next year,\" Adam thought to himself, \"I'll ask them to get married.\"\nThey would be graduating from the academy by then. It felt right—before the world plunged into the chaos of war with the demon race before uncertainty stole any more moments from their lives.\nHe had seen too many promises broken, too many dreams shattered in times of turmoil. He didn't want that for Valerie and Austin. Not when they had something so rare—so real.\nBefore the storm arrived, Adam wanted to secure the one thing that mattered: their happiness.\nKnock.\nThe sound pulled him from his thoughts.\n\"Come in,\" he called without lifting his head.\nThe door creaked open, revealing the familiar figure of the Knight Commander.\nClad in gleaming silver armor, the crest of Corwon shining proudly on his chest, the man stood tall and spoke with clear reverence, \"The carriage has been prepared, Your Grace.\"\nAdam gave a soft hum, closed the file in front of him, and rose from his chair.\nLately, troubling reports had been pouring in—people vanishing from a small western town under his jurisdiction. He'd already sent soldiers to investigate, but none had returned.\nThat's why he was going himself, leading a battalion to find answers.\n\"Let's go, Nathan,\" he said, walking toward the door. But just as he stepped out, he halted.\nHis wife stood there.\nHer eyes searched his face with worry, her hands clasped tightly in front of her. \"Are you leaving?\" she asked softly.\nAdam motioned for the knight to walk ahead and turned to her. \"Yes. Why do you ask?\"\nAnastasia hesitated. Her eyes couldn't hide the fear that weighed on her heart. \"I don't know… I just have a bad feeling. Could you not go? Just this once?\"\nHe exhaled gently, stepping closer. With both hands, he cupped her cheeks, his thumbs brushing her soft skin.\n\"You know I have to, dear. It's my duty,\" he whispered. \"And it's that time of the month—you always get uneasy around now.\"\nHe leaned in, pressing a tender kiss on her forehead. \"I'll be back in a few hours. Rest well, and ask the maids to bring you something warm and sweet, alright?\"\nShe gave a quiet hum in reply, unable to form the words she wanted to say. Lately, she had been clinging to him more than usual, worrying more than she should. But with the looming war, she knew she couldn't keep doing this.\nAdam stepped past her, heading down the corridor, his figure slowly fading into the distance.\nAnastasia turned to watch him go, her heart heavy.\nAnd then, in a voice no louder than a breath, she whispered, \"Please… let my fears be unneeded.\"\n°°°°°°°\nIn the palace nestled within the capital, Austin sat quietly on the edge of his sister's bed, her arms wrapped gently around him in a peaceful embrace.\nShe was asleep—breathing steadily, as if the weight she had been carrying had finally eased. The anger that had once clouded her face was now gone, replaced by a calm that softened her features.\nSoon, two figures stepped quietly into the room, moving slowly toward the pair.\n\"How is she?\" Valerie asked softly, careful not to disturb the silence.\nIt had been a long time since she'd seen Averis, and she could immediately tell—the girl had grown, not just in looks, but in presence. She looked beautiful.\nSebastian, standing beside her, let out a quiet sigh as he watched the siblings. There was something deeply touching about the way Averis clung to Austin, even in her sleep.\n\"She's… hurt,\" Austin said gently. \"She has a lot to say. And fortunately… she's ready to talk.\"\nThere was relief in his voice—real, honest relief. He had been bracing himself for her to push him away, or worse. But instead, she held him. She could have hurt him badly—he knew her strength—but she didn't. She had chosen not to.\nThat choice… it meant everything.\nHe nodded toward the corner of the room. \"Look,\" he said, his eyes guiding Valerie and Sebastian to a tall bookshelf.\nThey followed his gaze and stepped closer.\nTheir eyes widened when they saw it. Each shelf was packed with books about Shard—about how to evolve it, improve it, understand it. The pages were worn, the covers bent from being opened again and again. She had read them—countless times.\nAustin's shoulders sank slightly as he let out a breath, heavy with guilt and quiet sorrow. \"Even after everything I said… even after locking herself away because of me… she never stopped thinking about me.\"\nHis voice cracked a little. \"She wanted to help him. She still wanted to help.\"\nThe only person who had ever truly hated Austin… was Aiden. That hate had pushed Austin into a corner, made him pull away from everyone who cared about him.\nBut this—Averis—was proof that someone still cared. That even when he tried to push her away, she hadn't let go.\nValerie inched closer to her hand gently rested her hand on her head as she said, \"You have suffered a lot, Avy. But now, you are not alone.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- No comments from me.",

      "content": "Adam's arms trembled.\nIt had been over half an hour since the battle began, and still, the monsters kept coming. Their numbers weren't thinning—they were growing.\nRight in front of his eyes, he had watched his comrades fall. One by one, his soldiers—men he had trained with, laughed with, bled with—were struck down and silenced forever.\nThe town that had once buzzed with life, made prosperous by a newly built trade route, now lay in ruins—a graveyard soaked in blood and smoke.\nAnd yet, the town wasn't empty.\nThe only human left standing was Adam, but the population had not decreased. It had simply changed.\nThey surrounded him.\nBeings that didn't belong in this world—skin glowing red like molten metal, claws long and jagged, eyes wild with hunger. Their teeth bared, twitching with the urge to tear into flesh. Their very presence oozed one thing: a craving for human blood.\nAdam held his Shard—a pair of worn batons—so tightly his knuckles turned white. They were the last things tethering him to hope. If he dropped them, he wouldn't live another second.\nHe didn't want to die.\nNot yet.\nNot before spending a few quiet years with his wife. Not before seeing his daughter walk down the aisle, glowing with happiness.\nBut no matter how hard he tried to hold on to hope, some part of him already knew the truth.\nHe wasn't getting out of this alive.\nThese demons—though low in rank—numbered over a thousand. And even if he managed to break through, to escape… how far could he really run? How long before he was dragged back, torn apart?\n'And even if I make it out… others will die in my place.'\nThis wasn't just a massacre.\nIt was a trap. A carefully laid ambush designed for one purpose—him.\n\"You're a resilient human,\" came a voice—smooth, feminine, and dripping with mockery.\nAdam slowly turned his head and looked up.\nA demon hovered above, dark wings spreading lazily as they flapped just enough to keep her afloat. Her blood-red eyes locked onto his with wicked amusement.\nHe didn't flinch.\n\"We don't regenerate like worms,\" he said, meeting her gaze with steel. \"That's why we train. That's why we endure.\"\nNo fear in his voice.\nHe hadn't been trained to kneel before monsters.\nHe had been trained to erase them.\nThe demoness grinned, her fangs glinting as she hovered just out of reach.\n\"I really admire your ability to yap nonsense in the face of death,\" she said mockingly. \"You think provoking me will make me angry?\"\nAdam raised an eyebrow, the corner of his lip twitching in a tired smirk.\n\"You're not angry?\" he said. \"So… you just look ugly by default?\"\nHer smile cracked.\nIn a blink, she vanished—and reappeared right in front of him, her face twisted in rage. Before he could even register the movement, her hand was around his throat, lifting him off the ground like a ragdoll.\n\"Guh—!\" Adam choked, his legs dangling, vision shaking. His grip tightened around his batons, and he swung desperately, striking her hand.\nA sharp crack rang out—but the blow barely left a scratch on her crimson skin.\nShe didn't even flinch.\nIf anything, the tiny scratch only made her angrier. Her grip tightened.\nAdam's body kicked and twisted—his air was vanishing. And in that moment, he knew.\nMocking her had worked.\nMaybe not in the way he wanted—but it had gotten to her.\nPulling him closer until their faces nearly touched, the demoness growled, her voice low and venomous,\n\"Consider yourself lucky I want you alive. Otherwise, you'd already be a lifeless husk.\"\nAdam's body stiffened.\nAlive.\nShe wanted him alive.\nThe realization struck him hard—and fast.\nValerie.\nThat had to be it.\nClenching his jaw, Adam summoned his last ounce of strength. His hands, though trembling, brought his Shard together as he channeled his Soul Energy into them.\nThere was no escape now, and rather than allowing himself to be used to bait his daughter, Adam preferred to end his life right here and now.\nHe raised his batons, intending to snap them with the collision.\nHe drew in a sharp breath, but then—\nDhak!\nA sharp blow to his neck. Sudden. Precise. Brutal.\nThe world tilted.\nDarkness claimed him before the batons could connect.\nThe demoness caught his limp body before it fell and let out a soft, wicked chuckle.\n\"Now your worth…\" she murmured, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear, \"will be decided by how your precious loved ones react to your absence.\"\nShe turned toward one of the lower-ranked demons—a hunched, snarling creature with a twisted spine and dull eyes.\nWith a wave of her finger, she pointed to its chest.\nThe creature groaned, throat gurgling in discomfort, but didn't flinch as glowing symbols began to burn themselves into its flesh—a message that would let them know where they could find him.\nThe demoness grinned, eyes gleaming with sadistic delight.\n\"This,\" she whispered, \"is going to be very interesting.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\n\"Mmm…\"\nAveris stirred, mumbling softly as consciousness slowly returned to her. She felt unusually warm, cocooned in a strange sense of comfort—though she could already tell this wasn't her bed.\nAnd then her eyes fluttered open.\n\"Ah!\" She jolted upright, breaking free from the arms holding her.\nHer sudden movement startled everyone in the room.\nHer eyes widened—not from fear, but sharp, fiery aggression—as she glared at Austin.\n\"Don't assume I've forgiven you!\" she snapped, pointing a trembling finger at him, doing her best to look furious.\nAustin blinked at her, letting out a soft, helpless sigh.\n\"I'm not assuming anything,\" he said gently. \"You looked tired… so your big brother carried you.\"\n\"What big brother?!\" she shot back, arms crossed as she turned away from him with a scoff. \"You're no one to me!\"\nBut the moment her gaze swept across the room, she froze.\nValerie was sitting there, calm and collected.\n\"Hello, Avy,\" Valerie said with a small smile. \"It's been a while, hasn't it?\"\nAveris stood there, stunned. Her mouth opened slightly as she struggled to find words.\n\"You're still… with him?\" she finally asked, her voice filled with disbelief. \"Even after how he treated you?\"\nCompared to Averis, Valerie had endured far worse.\nAustin had only yelled at Averis once—said things he shouldn't have, yes. But to Valerie… he had done more than just raise his voice.\nHe had shut her out.\nDay after day, he ignored her. Pushed her away. Insulted her with silence more painful than any words.\nIt wasn't a single outburst.\nIt was slow, quiet torture.\nAnd yet… here she was.\nStill by his side.\nValerie rose from her seat and slowly approached Averis, her steps quiet, deliberate. She gently placed her hands on the girl's trembling shoulders, grounding her in place.\nIn a voice as soft as a whisper, she spoke,\n\"You're right. He treated me badly… worse than I ever expected. And I can only imagine how much it hurt you too.\"\nHer words weren't dramatic—just honest. Warm. Understanding.\n\"I know how you must've felt,\" she continued, her eyes tender. \"Because… we both love him more than anyone else, don't we?\"\nAveris's brows twitched. Her lips pressed into a thin line, and she turned her face away.\nShe didn't answer.\nBut her eyes—those stubborn, conflicted eyes—were glistening. The anger she tried so hard to hold onto was slipping through the cracks.\nShe did love him. And that made everything hurt even more.\nValerie smiled gently and cupped Averis's cheek, guiding her to look back.\n\"But everyone deserves a second chance, no?\" she said softly. \"He made a mistake. A painful one. But if we don't even give him the chance to make things right… wouldn't that be unfair, too?\"\nAveris didn't respond right away.\nBut her breathing slowed.\nAnd her eyes wavered.\nShe was breaking—and beneath that anger was a heart desperate to forgive.\nAustin heaved a sigh and said, \"Okay, let's go and have dinner. We haven't had anything since morning.\" He knew forcing her to take any decision right away would be unfair so he decided to give her some time.\nValerie smiling nodded before she ushered Averis, \"Let's go?\"\nHowever, \"I won't go out. Just because you apologize doesn't mean I will suddenly have a change of heart.\" She walked away from Valerie and sat down on her bed, with her back facing them.\nIn a heavy voice she said, \"You all leave.\"\nValerie looked at her Lord with a troubled look but Austin didn't appear to be bothered at all.\nSitting back down on the couch, he told the butler, \"Sebastian, please bring everyone's food here. Let's have a family dinner here.\"\nAveris flinched and turned to look at him with her lips parted.\nValerie smiled happily. It has been a while since they all shared a meal.\nSebastian smiled warmly as he bowed slightly and said, \"As you wish, my Lord.\"\nFinally, the family was reuniting.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Under the moon, two figures could be seen walking calmly with their hands connected and a peaceful atmosphere surrounding them.\nThe dinner with Averis went better than Austin expected. He wasn't actually expecting to have dinner with her at all; assuming she would throw them out. However, not only did she not say anything when Sebastian brought the food and their father joined, but also, when Valerie or the King asked things from Averis, she responded in hum.\nIt was a good progression in his opinion.\n\"She turned fourteen this year, no?\" Valerie asked in a soft voice. She was also thinking about the girl she met after so long.\nAveris and Valerie were quite close because they had a common interest to discuss. Austin.\nValerie's knowledge about Austin's likes and dislikes comes from Averis. She used to be a sweet and caring kid who could get along with anyone—even the cold and detached Valerie.\n\"Hmm. I am thinking of delaying a few days and staying with Averis more.\" Austin gave his opinion.\nThe academy would resume in a few days but after he finally reunited with his sister, he didn't want to leave quickly. Otherwise, all the progress he made would return to zero.\nValerie supported his decision, \"Considering our contribution during the ambush, the headmaster surely would give her permission.\"\n\"Are you also not returning?\" Austin suddenly asked, which made Valerie flinch.\nWith her eyes turning round, she asked, \"You want me to return?\" Her voice was tender as if she might cry\nAustin shook his head with a smile as he told her, \"I would have asked you to stay.\" Intertwining their fingers, which made her heart skip a beat, he added, \"Without you, I remain hopeless. So please stay by my side and guide me.\"\nThey didn't know when their feet paused and the duo continued to look into each other's eyes with evident fondness.\nAustin's gaze lingered at red lips, which suddenly tempted him to take a taste of them.\nHe pulled Valerie to the resting bench and made her sit on his lap, with her legs dangling on the other side.\nValerie leaned into his touch, her breath shallow and her body turning hot unnaturally.\nHit fingers traced her face like an artist admiring the work of their life.\nHis warmth was soothing and addictive.\nWith that look in their eyes, it was evident that they desired each other even though the duo remained close almost all the time.\n\"You don't hate me for wanting to kiss you so randomly right?\" He asked, his lips dangerously close to hers. Their breath collided, and the heat of their bodies became one.\nValerie's eyes were half open as if she was under the effect of alcohol.\nFrom that proximity, her voice sounded honey-dripping as she whispered, \"I can never hate you for wanting me.\"\nThose words were the final push he needed to lean forward and rest his lips on hers.\nIt felt as if a traveler had finally found the oasis it was searching for.\nTheir lips met in a gentle, touching kiss that made Valerie lean even more—content with what she was feeling but greedy to have more.\nAustin wasn't someone who could ignore his lover's unspoken demand.\nHis left hand trailed down her face, making her breath hitch before it went to the back of her neck, and Austin pulled her closer.\nAustin's lips moved with purpose now, drinking her in like she was the only thing that could quench his thirst.\nHer fingers curled around the fabric of his shirt. Her heart beating loud enough to resound in her ears.\nValerie suddenly shifted, her knees now on the bench and her arms hugging his neck.\nShe didn't know what came into her but taking the lead felt extremely exhilarating.\nAustin was now, just resting back, his hand encircled around her waist as he allowed his girl to be a little aggressive.\nThey paused for a moment, looking into each other's eyes and finding mutual hunger in them.\nTheir lips met again, this time with no holding back. It wasn't just a kiss—it was a collision of hunger and emotion.\nTheir mouths opened to each other, lips interlocking in a perfect rhythm. Valerie tilted her head slightly, deepening the kiss, and Austin welcomed her without hesitation.\nTheir tongues met—curious at first, then eager, dancing together in slow, heated strokes that made the world around them blur.\nHis hand slid up her back, holding her firmly as their kiss grew more intense—messier, breathier, but still full of passion.\nValerie let out a soft, breathless moan, the sound muffled between their mouths. Her hands gripped his shoulders, anchoring herself, as if afraid the kiss would pull her under completely.\nValerie finally lost the strength and sat back down on his lap.\nTheir lips finally parted after what seemed like a few minutes, as Valerie rested her head on his shoulder; her arms hugging his wide back.\nSoftly rubbing her back, he said, \"That was exciting...I never expected you to take the lead.\"\nValerie stiffened slightly, suddenly the words of her mother echoing in her ears—'Men only like docile girls, so never seek dominance.'\nShe parted from him and while looking into his eyes, she asked, \"You didn't hate it?\"\nAustin was actually taken aback by that question and that hesitation in her eyes was quite unexpected. What was she even thinking?\n\"Val...you can tell how much I loved it by feeling the heat beneath you.\"\nValerie's eyes slightly parted as she got conscious about the stiffness under her butt.\nHer face turned deep red as she again hugged him to hide her burning face.\nHowever, despite her shyness, she was glad that he didn't hate it.\nThey took a few minutes to calm themselves down. Austin might have become greedy a little too much these days, but he couldn't help it. She is just too addictive.\nValerie soon got up and so did Austin.\nIt was decided that they would take another week of leave from the academy and Austin would send the letter to the headmaster tomorrow.\nThey soon started walking back to the palace with serenity returning around them.\nValerie had a smile of contentment on her face as she hugged his arm and slowly returned to the palace.\n\"Young master.\" Suddenly, Sebastian rushed towards them, taking them by surprise.\n\"What happened, Sebas?\" Austin asked, but before he could say anything another voice came from the left.\n\"I just received a WarpMail from Corwon Duchy,\" Cedric informed them.\nHearing that, Valerie frowned as she asked, \"What did Father say?\"\nCedric shook his head, \"It wasn't the Duke. Your mother sent the mail stating that your father has been taken captive by the demons.\"\nValerie's eyes widened...demons...taken away?\nAustin stepped toward his father and asked, \"Who took him?\"\nCedric raised the letter before reading the name and telling him, \"Amenytr.\"\nAustin clenched his fist...why did the Demon Lord's daughter—ah!\n'It's because of me.'\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Play the boss music since the massacre is about to happen.",

After all, Austin was still too weak to face multiple high-ranking demons at once. But instead of charging straight at him, they changed tactics.\nThey targeted someone who could break him.\nWith Austin's parents heavily guarded, the demons didn't take unnecessary risks. Valerie was out of the question too—she would've sensed the threat and annihilated it before it even got close.\nThat left only one option. The only family that could make Austin drop everything. The ones he couldn't afford to lose.\nValerie's family.\n\"I should have warned him…\" Austin muttered, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles went white.\nThe letter from Anastasia still burned in his mind. Delivered by a demoness, its message was clear.\n[Come and get whom you desire to protect. Come alone, Hero… or this won't end well for your father-in-law~]\nAustin had some knowledge about Astaroth's daughter. She was powerful, yes, but unseasoned—Valerie could defeat her in single combat.\nBut that wasn't the problem.\nThe problem… was the army she commanded.\nShe carried the blood of Astaroth—the Demon King's heir—and that meant she could dominate the minds of lesser demons with ease. She didn't have to fight. She just had to give the order.\n'Even without her army, I'd barely stand a chance against her right now…' Austin clicked his tongue, frustrated.\nHe had been putting it off—leveling up, sharpening his skills. And now, when it mattered most, he was nowhere near ready.\n\"We should first visit the Duchy. Lady Anastasia must be quite worried.\" Cedric suggested to which Austin instantly nodded,\n\"Valerie and I would go there on foot. Sebastian-\"\n\"I will be coming along, sir.\" The butler declared his decision, which was unusual since he always first listened to his Lord's words. However, right now, Sebastian has to be with him to ensure Austin's safety.\nAustin didn't argue with the older one and nodded, \"Okay then,\"\nCedric soon added, \"I will assign soldiers and send the Knight Commander to ensure Dukedom's safety.\"\nAustin nodded, and on that note, everyone returned to their rooms to prepare.\nAustin returned to his room to pack his bag. He took every potion he had, along with a few weapons and dumped it all inside his Inventory.\nUntil now he wasn't sure if he would be going to the other side or not. However, if he really had to, he would need all the help he could from the System.\n[Ding!]\n[Combat: 90/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Romance: 75/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[Durability: 92/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Trickery: 37/50]\n{Next reward at 50}\n[Overall Progression: 76/100]\n[Next Reward at 100]\n…\n[Ding!]\n[You have one reward pending!]\nAustin sat down on the bed and told the system, \"Show me the reward.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Soulwarden Veil: Provides absolute protection to your soul for a certain period. In this period, the host's soul energy would neither deplet nor any weapon would be able to damage the Host's soul.]\n[Time limit: 10 minutes]\n[Cooldown: 48 hours]\n[Note: This skill would naturally upgrade as the host goes through progression.]\nAustin frowned...this was an unexpected reward.\n'So what are you saying right now...for ten minutes I would have an unbreakable soul and endless Soul Energy?'\n[That's right, host.]\nAustin still wasn't sure what this new skill could truly offer him.\nUntil now, he'd never lost a fight because of a lack of Soul Energy. His victories were always the result of his martial arts and battle instincts—pure combat experience honed through blood and grit.\nBut that wasn't the whole truth either.\nHe knew his limits. And because of that, he'd always held back when it came to relying on his weapons. Not because they weren't powerful, but because he couldn't afford to overextend.\nMore than once, battles that stretched into grueling minutes could've ended in seconds—if only he had been able to use his weapons at full power.\nMaybe this skill… he thought, eyes narrowing, will finally show me how strong I really am.\nAfter a moment of silence, he asked aloud, \"How many points do I have now?\"\n[Total points: 4021]\nAustin let out a quiet hum and leaned back in his seat, his arms crossed.\nHe had dropped a thousand points not long ago, bringing him back to the low two-thousands. Yet here he was again, already past four thousand.\nAll because of the monsters he'd hunted—mindlessly, relentlessly—in the third dungeon.\nNot for a mission. Not for survival. Just to escape the whirlwind of emotions boiling inside him.\nAnd now, that recklessness might be the only reason he had enough to make a difference.\nAustin spent a while scrolling through the list of available weapons. But even with over three thousand points, nothing caught his eye—at least, nothing worth spending on. The ones he wanted were either locked behind a higher rank or simply not useful for his current state.\nHe sighed and closed the interface.\nThere was no point in wasting resources just because he could. He'd wait.\nTurning on his heel, Austin stepped out of the room—\n\"Ah!\" he gasped, startled.\nValerie was standing right outside.\nHer eyes were unfocused, her expression blank, and her shoulders hung low, like someone carrying the weight of something too heavy to speak of.\n\"Val?\" Austin's voice softened as he reached out, gently cupping her cheek.\nShe slowly raised her gaze to meet his.\n\"...He won't return alive...\" she whispered, her voice trembling with a fragility he'd never seen in her before.\nAustin's heart sank.\nValerie—who never wavered, never showed concern for herself—was unraveling. Not for her own safety. Not for Austin's.\nBut for the man who had always stood between her and danger.\nHer father.\nAnd now… he was gone where even she couldn't reach.\nHer voice was cracked and fragile. The composure she always wore—the unshakable confidence that defined Valerie—had slipped, and what was left was the little girl who had once clung to a man's back as he carried her through her childhood.\nShe tried to swallow the grief down, but it was too thick. Her eyes were glazed over, not from crying, but from refusing to cry.\nUntil now, Austin might have doubted whether he would be going to the other side or not. However, upon looking at his beloved breaking apart like this,\n\"I am going to save him. And that...is a promise.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Ah, this will be short but interesting. Drop a comment",

      "content": "Rudolph was working out at his home. It has been over a week since he returned, and until now, other than the battles with his father and the food his mother cooks, nothing was interesting happening around him.\nHe sent a letter to Rhea a few days ago but hasn't received any response.\nHe would have visited her hometown to surprise her but there was not much time left. In about a week, the classes would resume, so they would meet there anyway.\n\"Dinner's ready!\"\nAt the sound of his mother's voice, Rudolph released his grip from the steel bar fixed to the wall, letting himself drop cleanly onto his palms before rising to his feet. He set the metal plates on the ground, washed his hands and face, and made his way to the living room.\nJust as he entered, he saw his father stepping inside from the main door, looking unusually tense.\n\"Father?\" Rudolph called out, his voice sharp with concern.\nHis question reached his mother as well. She approached quickly, wiping her hands, her expression already tight with worry. \"What did you hear at the royal palace?\"\nThey both knew he had been summoned urgently by the King. The matter couldn't be trivial.\nThe older man gave a heavy sigh. \"Duke Corwon has been kidnapped… by demons. His Majesty has tasked me with going to the Dukedom to oversee its security while he's gone.\"\nHis wife gasped in shock, and Rudolph's brows furrowed deeply.\n\"Sir Adam? That's hard to believe. He's not someone a handful of demons could take down.\" Rudolph had heard the stories—how the Duke had stood firm against waves of enemies, how he'd emerged victorious from wars where others would've fallen.\nHis father's next words were grim. \"It wasn't a handful. An army of demons marched in. Over a thousand citizens died. And the Demon General himself took the Duke away.\"\nRudolph's voice was low but certain. \"They're doing this to lure Valerie.\"\nIt made sense. Kidnapping her father would be the most effective way to force her hand. And if Valerie crossed the border to rescue him... there might be no coming back.\n\"I'm leaving for the Dukedom now,\" his father said firmly.\nBut his wife reached out, distressed. \"At least leave tomorrow—it's already dark outside.\"\n\"No, Mary,\" he replied softly but with finality. \"The Dukedom is exposed without its ruler. I need to go now.\"\nThere was no room for protest. He had made up his mind.\n\"I'll come too,\" Rudolph declared suddenly.\nBoth parents looked at him.\n\"My friends are there... and I have a bad feeling about all of this. I need to be there in case anything goes wrong.\"\nSomething heavy sat in Rudolph's chest—a silent warning, a shadow creeping over the horizon.\nAnd he couldn't ignore it.\n°°°°°°°°\n\"What did you wish for, dear?\" Adam asked gently, watching as Anastasia opened her eyes almost immediately after closing them in prayer before the sculpture of God.\nShe turned to him with a soft smile and said, \"I wished to leave this world before you.\"\nAdam blinked, visibly startled. \"Why would you wish for something like that?\"\nAnastasia stepped closer, her eyes lifting to meet his. There was warmth in her gaze, but also a quiet ache. \"Because I can't imagine a day without seeing you. I don't want to live in a world where you're not there… That's why I wished to go first.\"\nThat moment... that simple, heartfelt exchange... had happened seven years ago.\nAnd it hadn't been the first or the last time she had made that wish.\nNow, Anastasia stood alone at the mansion's entrance, the wind cold against her skin as she stared down the dark, empty road.\nShe was waiting—hoping Adam would somehow escape his captors and come back to her.\nShe wanted to be the first to see him. The first to hold him. She didn't care what it took—even if it meant becoming the captive in his place.\nShe just wanted him to come back safely.\nYet, deep in her heart, she knew...\nIt was nothing more than a fragile, desperate dream.\n\"Mother,\" A hand rested on her shoulder and Anastasia's eyes began to turn moist.\nShe turned toward her daughter and hugged her, \"Valerie!\"\nValerie embraced her mother and softly rubbed her back.\nShe was wailing, and shoulders trembling. Her cries echoed through the mansion. Her tears exposed the grief and anxiety she was feeling at the moment.\nAustin stood at a side, watching the duo with a look of concern in his eyes.\nHe was aware of how much Adam mattered to these two ladies.\n\"Valerie...your father...I told him to not go...but he didn't listen *hicc*...Valerie...\" She was barely breathing because of her sobs and the words that followed.\nValerie glanced at Austin and after nodding the blond one went inside the mansion and brought a glass of water\n\"Mom, first calm down and drink this. Dad won't come back if you cry like this, so first, stop crying.\"\nHearing those words, Anastasia turned silent and nodded obediently.\nShe took the glass and sipped water.\nOnce she calmed down a little, Valerie brought her inside the house and urged her to sit down.\nAnastasia sat down before Valerie crouched before her.\nHolding her hand, she said, \"First tell me how you received the message?\"\nThe lady slowly relayed, \"It was written on a demon's body...I wrote whatever was written in the letter.\"\nValerie nodded, \"I understand. What about follow-up? Did you receive any report for any ambush?\"\nAnastasia shook her head, \"No...other than the citizens from the town where your father was abducted, no one else has been attacked.\"\n\"But why did the father go there in the first place?\" Valerie asked soon after.\n\"Several missing reports were arriving...so he went to check himself...even though I told him not to go...\" Tears welled up in her eyes again.\nValerie glanced at Austin before the blond wordlessly told her to first calm down her mother.\nValerie nodded before she told her mother, \"Mom, rest for a few hours. The Knight Commander will arrive tomorrow, and when he arrives, we will discuss what we should do.\"\nAnastasia knew that she wouldn't be able to rest with her current mental state but she didn't stay there for long and got up. She also wanted to stay alone for now...\nSeeing her walking toward her room slowly, with her shoulders dropped Austin told Valerie, \"Don't leave her alone for long. Be with her.\"\nValerie anxiously asked back, \"What are we going to do?\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, but before he could tell her what he had thought of, which Valerie surely wouldn't like, a familiar voice interrupted them,\n\"I think I can help you two.\"\nThey turned towards the person instantly, and their eyes widened upon seeing the lady here.\nIt was the advisor of the Council and the only person who could actually help them in this situation.\nSelner.\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Valerie generally feels irritated whenever she sees Selner because there is something about her gaze when she looks at Austin that makes her cautious.\nHowever, at the moment, she was thankful for her arrival since they really needed support. Especially if someone is well aware of the situation on both sides.\nNow, the four of them, including Sebastian, were sitting in a private room to discuss things.\nIt was the same room where Austin stayed when he was here.\n\"What do you plan on doing?\" Selner started with Austin's opinion on the matter.\nAustin didn't hesitate to reveal, \"I will go there and bring him back.\"\n\"I will be coming.\"\n\"Me too, young master.\"\nThe other two instantly added with their eyes holding the stubbornness that knew no rejection or allowed an argument.\nSelner raised her brows and said, \"Didn't she clearly state that Austin has to go alone or she will harm Adam?\" The violet-haired woman asked them.\nAnd since the Demoness has asked only for Austin, she surely would first inspect that he truly is alone before she would release Adam.\nValerie clenched her fists and said, \"There is a high chance that the demon wouldn't liberate my father even if Austin goes there alone. So either it's with us or he won't go.\" Her heart felt heavy when she spoke those words, but to save someone close to her, Valerie couldn't risk the reason she was alive.\nSeeing the rising tension between them, Austin changed the topic, \"What do you know about the Demoness?\" His knowledge comes from the game, but surely, Selner, who has permission to wander to any realm, must have more information on the heir of darkness.\nSelner leaned back in her seat, her eyes drifting toward the ceiling as she said, \"Someone who recently got into control. She is a naive Demon who gets easily provoked. However, because she has the blood of Astaroth, underestimating her would be lethal. Other than that, none of the Generals are under her control, but only lesser demons.\"\nAustin asked, \"Are these demons on the same level that attacked my father's carriage?\"\nSelner nodded in response, but then she added, \"Although I haven't seen him, I heard there is a brother of Amenytr. You need to be careful of him.\"\nAustin let out a slow breath. There was indeed an army waiting—but if they were anything like the ones he'd already fought, then victory was still within reach.\nThe real threat was Amenytr... and her brother. They were bound to be in a completely different league.\n\"Can't we ask for the Council's help?\" Sebastian suggested. \"This involves a human hostage. It's their mess, to begin with—they should take responsibility.\"\nBut Selner, arms crossed and tone cool, replied, \"They won't take any action. Not with limited resources and no concrete proof of what—or who—is on the other side.\"\nAustin glanced at her, voice calm but loaded with meaning. \"Speaking of the Council… you know who's letting all this happen, right?\"\nValerie and Sebastian exchanged confused looks, but Selner just stared back at Austin, a quiet fire in her eyes.\n\"I think his time has come,\" she said. \"Tolerating any more would be foolish.\"\nIf that bastard really was the one enabling demons to slip through the cracks into the human realm, then Selner knew she had to act—and soon.\n\"Do it with evidence,\" Austin advised his voice firm. \"Otherwise, you'll make an enemy out of the entire Council.\"\nSelner didn't respond. She neither confirmed nor denied—only stood in silence.\nValerie was about to ask what they were talking about, but before she could, Selner shifted the conversation.\n\"Austin,\" she said, \"I want to assess your Shard.\"\nAustin blinked. \"My Shard?\" He hesitated for a second but then nodded. \"Alright.\"\nHe summoned his dagger and stood up, handing it to her.\nSebastian remained wary. He wasn't sure why his Lord trusted this woman so easily—but Valerie showed no concern, so he believed Selner must have earned that trust somehow.\nSelner studied the Shard intently, one hand cradling her elbow while the other cupped her chin.\n\"You've progressed,\" she finally said, \"but not enough to inherit your third fragment.\"\nAustin lowered his eyes slightly. \"I know. I should've been more focused on training.\"\nSelner shook her head. \"You're already advancing at an incredible pace. Forcing yourself further would only bring harm.\"\nShe rested a hand on his shoulder. \"Stop trying to carry everything alone. You have people you can rely on now.\"\nAustin gave a nod, taking her words to heart—but the cloud of worry didn't quite leave his face.\nBecause the truth was... they still hadn't found a clear path forward.\nBringing Valerie and Sebastian to the other side would risk everything—including Adam's life.\nOnce they crossed the Sea of Separation, the demons would know. They'd be waiting. Watching.\nAnd there'd be no sneaking past them.\nAfter a moment of quiet thought, Austin finally asked, \"What would happen if I inherited the third fragment of my soul in my current state?\"\nSelner exhaled deeply, arms folding as she looked him straight in the eye. \"Too much of a burden on your soul. You haven't reached the stage where your spirit can carry something that heavy.\"\nHer voice grew firmer. \"And since you're talking about fragments—know this: the third won't be helpful. To draw out your Shard's full potential, you'll need the fourth fragment. But if you try to inherit that now... your soul will shatter. You'll die.\"\nShe didn't sugarcoat it. She couldn't afford to.\nIf it were the third, maybe there'd be a sliver of hope. But facing an entire demon army would demand more. And that meant reaching for power his soul couldn't even survive touching.\n\"So, what you're saying is…\" Austin's eyes narrowed, and a spark lit in his tone, \"...if I absorb it now, my soul gets damaged, right?\"\nSelner's brows drew together. Something in his voice threw her off—there was no despair, no hesitation. Just a dangerous sort of calm.\n\"Yes,\" she replied cautiously, watching him closely.\nBut Austin was already thinking ahead. \"I can't absorb it,\" he said, \"but I can temporarily use it... right?\"\nSelner looked genuinely confused now. \"But the burden would be the same. That level of power—it'll still crush you. So how do you plan on handling that?\"\nAustin's lips curled into a grin. \"I have a way.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Rudolph arrived at the Dukedom with his father early the next morning. The journey had been slower than usual—they had an entire battalion with them, and moving that many soldiers took time.\nAs he stepped down from his mount, Rudolph rolled his neck, letting out a soft crack. He could fight an entire day without feeling half as exhausted as he was now, after days of stiff, restless travel.\n\"I'm heading to meet the Governor General,\" his father said.\nRudolph gave a short nod and turned to go his own way.\nHe approached the mansion with four soldiers following behind—not as his guards, but to secure the residence itself. With the Dukedom's ruler gone, the threat of a demon resurgence was real. They couldn't afford to take chances.\nThough the estate had its own guards, reinforcements were a necessity. The air was tense, as if everyone expected something to go wrong.\nThe Knight Commander had stepped in to take charge, assuming temporary control of the town. Security had been tightened. Warnings were issued. Civilians were told to stay inside the city limits.\nMartial control, they called it.\nBut to Rudolph, it just felt like waiting for a storm.\nRudolph was allowed to enter the mansion after he showed them the crest of the Empire.\n\"First, inspect the mansion from the outside, check every corner, and then take your positions,\" Rudolph told them, and the soldiers immediately went to work.\nHe really didn't like to order them when he was beneath them in social standings and in terms of experience as well, but right now, it was a necessity.\nHe entered the mansion and found a maid passing by, so he called out, \"Hey, can you call Valerie for me?\"\nThe maid first asked for his identity before she told him, \"Please come inside.\"\nRudolph nodded and stepped toward the reception...where he found Sebastian.\n\"Oh, hey Sebastian. Where are Austin and Valerie.\"\nSebastian looked unusually worried but Rudiloh thought he was worried about the Duke.\nHowever, \"Master Rudolph...fortunately you are here. Can you keep the Duchess company? I need to go somewhere.\"\n\"Yes, I can but why are you in a rush? What happened?\" Rudolph was well acquainted with the Duke and the Duchess since they had met at several gatherings before, so there was no problem for him to keep her company. But what concerned him was Sebastian's unnatural behavior.\nSebastian informed him of his reason for concern, \"The young master...has gone to the other side to bring back the Duke. All alone. And Lady Valerie, upon learning that, went after him.\"\n\"...\" Rudolph was rendered speechless upon hearing that.\nSebastian didn't remain standing there for long and dashed out of the house.\nWho knew falling asleep for a few minutes would cause such chaos.\n.....\nThe skies of the Demon Realm were dark—dark like dried blood.\nThe land beneath their feet was cracked and lifeless as if it hadn't seen rain in years.\nThe air was heavy and thick with the smell of blood. It clung to Austin's throat, making him feel sick.\nHe and Selner had arrived here through her magic, so the journey hadn't taken long.\nNow, as they walked toward Astaroth's castle, Austin's mind drifted to Valerie.\nHe still didn't know how she would react to his sudden departure.\nBut knowing her… she would definitely try to follow him.\nThankfully, he had asked Sebastian to keep an eye on her.\nIt had been almost impossible to convince him, though.\nAustin had said something harsh—something that probably hurt Sebastian more than he realized.\nHe sighed. I'll apologize when I get back…\n\"If you're worried about Valerie,\" Selner said, breaking the silence, \"you don't have to be. I've assigned an S-rank to keep her within the human realm.\"\nAustin turned, surprised. \"Really? You can do that?\"\nSelner gave a small nod. \"Some of the top-ranking soldiers were trained by me. A few of them are S-ranks. I asked one of them to stop her if she tries to cross the Sea of Separation.\"\nAustin didn't say anything for a moment. He was still wrapping his head around it.\nShe was prepared for everything… huh?\n\"…Tell me something,\" he said quietly. \"Has Valerie always been like this?\"\nSelner looked at him for a moment. \"You mean… drawn to you?\"\nHe nodded.\n\"When you had all the fragments, you were different,\" she said gently. \"But even before that, when you were both kids, you were the only one who never looked at her like she was strange. That meant everything to her. And when you awakened… you became someone she admired. To her, you were special.\"\nSelner paused, her voice softening even more.\n\"She's always been this way—affectionate, kind… and completely in love with you.\"\nAustin smiled...fortunately, his previous self was not an a**hole to Valerie.\nSince there was some more time to reach the castle and Austin didn't want to stay silent and get his anxiety level rise, he asked, \"How was I...when I had all the fragments?\"\nSelner hummed in response, before she said, \"Confident, cocky, strong...and excessively insane.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Maybe the side effect of attaining a strong Shard.\"\n\"Not, maybe. That's the case.\" Selner added instantly, \"You grew up like that because you had everything. Your strength was unmatched, and you brought your country to the top of the world. Union Council, in that timeline, easily bent to your will since they couldn't dare to go against Austin Eryndor, the strongest warriors known to mankind.\"\nAustin was really surprised to know about himself so much. So if he actually had awakened a strong Shard...he would have become a completely different person, huh?\nAfter a brief pause, he asked, \"And which version do you like better?\"\nSelner hesitated this time before she revealed, \"This version is much more admirable since you know the value of strength and you are working hard to get it....but that version of you...I don't know...there was a certain charm about it that I couldn't help but...\" She stopped herself...almost saying something that she surely would have regretted.\nAustin also didn't push her anymore, not because he wasn't curious but rather because the castle finally appeared before them.\nHis heart rate elevated when he saw the rows of demons and demonic beasts stationed before the castle.\nAnd before all of them stood the demon who invited him here.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Valerie gritted her teeth as she pushed herself off the ground and gripped her Shard with enough force to make her knuckles white.\nShe couldn't understand why a warrior working for the Council was coming her way.\n\"I am warning you again. Get out of my way-*Thunk*\" Those words were followed by a sharp collision of her Shard and the ground.\nIce crept toward the other person—a woman in her early twenties with slightly dark blue hair—but the woman didn't panic and with a grin, she slammed her palms together—\n**BOOOOOM**\n—sending a shockwave that broke Valerie's momentum and she was sent stumbling back\nThe lady wore her Shard on her left hand, a gauntlet glowing slightly blue.\nThe woman rested her hands on her waist, looking at the irritated girl with a face full of amusement, as she said, \"Look, sweetie, I don't like bullying people generally. But someone has asked me to keep you away from the dangerous place. So please return so we both can have some much-needed rest.\"\nValerie scowled, \"Selner told you that, right?!\" She couldn't believe that the woman betrayed her like this. Not only did she take Austin away with her she even put someone to forbid Valerie from reaching him.\nSwirling her spear, Valerie growled, \"I will ask you again nicely ....move and I won't kill you.\"\n\"Oh, sweety...how delusional you can be. Well, I would love to see you try.\" With her arms crossed she provoked the other person.\nValerie decided to stop holding back. If she has to remove this six-foot-tall obstacle out of her way to reach Austin, then so be it.\n°°°°°°°°\n\"I told you to come alone. Looks like you don't care much about the old man,\" the Demoness said, her tone calm but laced with venom.\nShe floated in the air, wings outstretched, fingers curled under her chin as she looked down at Austin. Her frame was slender, cloaked in darkness, with blood-red eyes that scanned him slowly, as if trying to see what made him so dangerous.\nAfter all, this was the man who had left her father so broken that he had to disappear—retreat into hiding just to heal.\n\"I have no authority over either realm,\" Selner spoke, her voice cool, distant. \"So, for what it's worth—pretend I'm not here.\"\nAmenytr—the Demoness—knew exactly what Selner was. A witch.\nWitches had always stayed away from the war between demons and humans. In return, neither side dared touch them. Not because they were neutral observers, wandering between worlds in search of truth and power, but because no one wanted to provoke creatures that could level entire civilizations on a whim.\nWitches were anomalies—unnatural, ancient forces. Capable of erasing entire races, collapsing dimensions, or burning stars to ash. They weren't feared. They were respected with terror.\nAmenytr's eyes narrowed. \"You don't step where you aren't invited. And I never invited you to the castle. So stay right here… while I take my guest to meet his future father-in-law.\"\nSelner grinned, sharp and cold.\n\"Are you sure you want to play it like that?\" she asked softly. \"I swore an oath to bring him back alive. And to keep that oath, I won't hesitate to break the ancient vow we witches made—to never interfere with mortal lives.\"\nShe took a single step closer, her presence growing heavier with each word.\n\"Test me, and I'll make sure your name and your people become a forgotten story—one that ends today. You know I can do it. And you know I will.\"\nAmenytr didn't flinch. Not outwardly. But inside, her heart tightened.\nStill… she hadn't come this far to be cowed by threats.\n\"No one here will harm him. But if you push this further, the hostage will be the one who suffers. That blame will be on you.\"\nSelner's smile faded. Her eyes sharpened, but she stepped back.\nTurning to Austin, she said gently, \"You know how to call me. If anything happens—just say the word.\"\nAustin didn't say anything. Being near Selner always felt strange… warm, in a way that reminded him of his mother. A safety he hadn't felt in a long time.\nBut she was the only one he could trust in this hellish place.\nHe gave a silent nod.\nThe rows of demons parted without a sound as Amenytr led him into the heart of the demonic castle.\nThe moment his foot crossed the threshold—\n\"..!\"\nA wave of crushing pressure hit him like a wall.\nThe air grew thick, suffocating. His instincts screamed.\nSomething ancient, vile, and hungry was inside this palace. A presence so twisted, so overwhelming, that every fiber of his being knew—\n'Something in here wants me dead.'\nSeeing that reaction on his face, Amenytr grinned, \"The stories I heard about you and the person I am seeing right...I can't express how disappointed I am right now. You are nothing but a weak bug.\" Contempt and mockery laced her voice.\nAustin chuckled, \"Then I am sure you call your father a bug as well. I heard he is in a pitiful state.\"\nThe Demoness clenched her fists and told him, \"Don't you dare say anything about him. You are not worthy to even breathe in the same air as him.\"\nAustin rolled his eyes and swallowed down the best response that came to his mind. There was no point in arguing with this...Princess.\nHe was led through a long passageway. The sound of the demonic army is slowly fading.\nAustin had remembered his way inside, even though there were several passageways with the same interior. The only place he found excessively difficult to weave through was the council office.\nFinally, they arrived before a cave-like door as Amenytr descended the stairs. Austin naturally followed her.\nThere was an underground floor. The smell of this place was excessively disgusting...the smell of piss and dead bodies made it nearly impossible to breathe normally.\n'Feels like I have stepped into a slaughterhouse...'\nThere were cells on the floor, and inside them were several captives—some barely alive and some dead. Some of them were humans, and some were demons.\nAustin silently followed the Demoness until she stopped before a certain cell.\nInside the cell was the familiar man, leaning against the wall, his eyes closed but he was breathing.\n\"Father,\" Austin called out as he pulled the door and stepped inside the cell.\nAdam was startled upon hearing the voice as he opened his eyes wide and exclaimed, \"Why are you here?!\" He was visibly shaken up seeing Austin here.\n\"I am here to take you back. Mother and Valerie are waiting for you so let's go-\"\n\"What's the rush,\" Austin paused as suddenly Ameytr crossed her arms and the demon soldier closed the door.\nAustin growled, \"You said you would release him if I came here. Now let him go!\"\nThe Demoness chuckled, \"And you believed I would let him go? Just like that?\"\nAdam's heart clenched...how could Austin fall for the trap, and why did Valerie allow him to come here?\nAustin got up while supporting Adam and said, \"What do you want now?\"\nThe Demoness shrugged, \"I can let you go...but only one of you.\" She suddenly pulled a dagger from the holster before throwing it inside the cell.\nWith a grin, she relayed, \"It's really simple. One of you has to kill the other. The one who survived can go back. I give you my word.\"\nAustin frowned upon hearing that, \"What games are you playing? You want me right? Just fight me but let him go!\"\n\"Ah-nah-nah. I would have fought you if only you hadn't brought that bitch along. Now that she is here, I can't hurt you.\" With a face-splitting grin, she added, \"But surely he can.\" While pointing at Adam she said.\nHearing those words, Austin realized that bringing Selner might have backfired.\nIf he tries to escape taking Selner's help then the Demoness would surely kill Adam.\nThen...what was the way?\nLooking at the dagger, Austin picked it up.\nAdam took a deep breath and turned towards him.\nFrom his expression it was apparent that the man was ready to sacrifice himself.\nYes, his wife and daughter would be sad....but not even once Adam thought of taking the life of that person whom his daughter loves more than herself.\nThat was just unacceptable.\nThat's why, \"Austin, I wan-\"\n\"Father, say my goodbye to Val.\"\n*SQUELCH*\nAdam's face turned pale.\nAmeytr's grin widened.\nThe reason for their reaction was the blond boy who fell to the ground after stabbing himself.\nAt the age of eighteen, Austin Eryndor died.\n°°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Damn it was a long journey.

What happened?\" Hearing her husband's voice she instantly turned towards him.\nShe opened her mouth but she wasn't able to speak.\nCedric instantly brought water for her, and while rubbing her back, he said, \"Breathe first. No need to rush, just breathe for now.\"\nShe instinctively followed his words and exhaled the breath that she had been holding for who knows how long.\nOnce she somehow calmed down, Cedric made her drink some water, before he asked, \"Now tell me slowly, what happened.\"\nSophie's hand was trembling, her eyes quivering for some reason.\nThis was the first time, ever since that day when she woke up after Aiden's death, he had seen her so much shaken up.\nCedric assumed it might be one of those episodes...but\n\"Austin...he...he is in danger...\"\nCedric's expression turned grim. He didn't take his wife's words lightly. He first asked her to drink some water and take some rest before he immediately walked out of the room before calling out,\n\"Robert.\" Cedric's personal butler and Sebastian's younger brother appeared before him.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Assess the situation at the Dukedom and send me a WarpMail as soon as you get the report on Austin.\"\nRobert didn't require to be told twice. He instantly faded into the shadows and left for his destination.\nCedric glanced at the family picture hanging in the gallery as he muttered under his breath,\n'Don't take any rash step, son.'\n°°°°°°°°°°\nAdam couldn't believe his eyes. His mind refused to register what was right in front of him.\nThere, lying on the ground, was the young man he had welcomed into his family just days ago. The one his daughter loved with all her heart—her best friend, her future. The boy he had imagined walking down the aisle with her, exchanging vows, building a life together.\nNow he was drenched in blood, unmoving, a dagger buried deep in his abdomen.\nAdam stood frozen, his heart pounding in his ears. His breath caught in his throat. The world felt muted, as though reality itself recoiled from what had happened.\nAustin… had saved him.\nWhy?\nWhy would he do something so reckless—for him?\nHe was just an old man, already past his prime. He had lived a full life beside the woman he loved. His days were numbered anyway.\nBut Austin… he had a future. Dreams. A world of possibilities waiting for him. And now… all of that was slipping away before Adam's eyes.\n\"No… you can't die like this…\" Adam whispered, his voice cracking as he dropped to his knees beside him.\nHe grabbed Austin's collar with trembling hands, pulling him close—desperately, hopelessly—wishing for any sign of life.\nAdam's hands trembled as he held Austin close, his blood soaking into the sleeves of his robe.\nHis lips quivered, the words stuck in his throat.\n\"You fool…\" he choked, his voice barely a whisper. \"You absolute fool… Why would you do this?\"\nAustin's face was pale. Too pale. Adam couldn't feel him breathing. He cupped his cheek with a shaking hand, brushing away a lock of blood-matted hair.\n\"You had no right… No right to throw your life away like this… not for me…\"\n\"Just move it!\" The Demoness shoved Adam aside and pulled Austin up.\nMurderous intent flared to life as Adam summoned his Shard and charged at the b*tch!\n\"Agh!\" However, his effort was futile as the inhumane caught him by her tail and gestured towards the nearby soldiers.\nThe ape-like demon slammed its metal rod at the back of Adam's head, causing him to lose consciousness.\nOnce Ameytr was done with the pest she brought her finger near Austin's nose.\nNot breathing.\nShe touched his chest.\nNo heartbeat.\nA grin extended her lips, her razor-sharp teeth on display.\nThe same being who caused her father to go into hiding all those years ago was lying dead in her arms.\n\"Return this guy to the Witch outside.\" The soldier nodded to those words before picking Adam over his shoulder and walking out of the cell.\nThe Demoness didn't care how the Witch would react. But since it wasn't her who killed Austin, she couldn't go against her words.\nAmeytr picked Austin in her arms and ascended to the upper floor before she walked towards the central room where 'he' rested\nThe smile on her face never faded. She couldn't be any more happy than this. It was as if she had fulfilled her life goal by annihilating this being.\n\"Poor thing...killed himself for his lover's father.\" The Demoness mocked as her steady strides brought her to the room where her father rested.\nThere were a few medics who were constantly monitoring his situation.\nIn these few days, his eyes and half of his face had recovered, and he could see what was happening around him. But because he lacked the ability to regenerate he needs to rely on external sources to get himself healed.\n\"Your Highness.\" The medic in charge greeted her, but Ameytr ignored him and advanced towards the cylindrical tube where her Father rested.\nOnce she reached the tube, she raised Austin's body and said, \"I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A GIFT!\" She announced in a loud tone, and instantly the whole castle shook.\nThe demons around her had to take support; otherwise, they would have fallen.\nThe recovery tube vibrated as Astaroth's eyes were filled with evident satisfaction and glee.\nAmeytr grinned in response, as she lowered Austin's body and said, \"He tormented you...caused us to hide...but no longer. I have taken your revenge, Father.\" A euphoric smile spreaded her lips.\nThe doctor who stood behind, stepped forward and said, \"My Lord is happy. You have made him proud, Your Highness.\"\nHer chest was filled with pride. Despite how everyone called her a failure and an irresponsible princess, she has achieved something they could never have.\nShe brought down her father's arch-nemesis!\n\"I have killed the bug, fath-khak!\"\nThe medical team jolted.\nThe eyes of the Demon Lord turned wide.\nBlood poured out of Ameytr's belly as a blue-glowing sword pierced her.\nSlowly, she tilted her head and looked at the person in her arms.\nA soft smile adorned Austin's lips as he said, \"Peek-a-boo~\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "The moment Austin heard the Demoness' scheme, he knew that if he tried to escape from here, which he could have easily since Ameytr couldn't harm him, she wouldn't let Adam go.\nAnd trying to bring Adam along without getting caught by the rows of demons outside the castle was nearly impossible.\nThere was a lot of risk and Austin wasn't going to let anything happen to Adam.\nThat's why, he devised a plan.\n'System, the Death Disguise...release it in my mouth. ' Austin, thankfully, remembers all the tools he received from the system.\n(A/N:- If you have forgotten—Upon swallowing the pill, the Host's heartbeat halts for five minutes, effectively simulating death. During this time, the Host is indistinguishable from a lifeless body. The effect persists until the orb's influence completely dissipates.)\nAnd one of those rewards was the Death Disguise, a pill that was suited for this situation.\nBut there was still a problem.\nThe dagger was definitely coated with poison, so plunging it inside himself would cause serious injury, and might would render him powerless further.\n[Ding!]\n[The host can coat the dagger with the Absolute Barrier to avoid getting poisoned by the blade.]\nSeeing that suggestion, Austin's eyes lit up.\nThat's right, thanks to the recent upgrade, the barrier would last for at least twenty minutes. So there was no problem.\nTurning towards the older man, Austin heard him saying,\n\"Austin, kill me-\" However,\n\"Father, say my goodbye to Val.\" Austin didn't think twice before plunging the dagger and biting onto the pill that appeared inside his mouth.\nAnd for those five minutes, Austin was dead.\n...\n\"H-How this can be?!\" Ameytr's shock overwhelmed her consciousness as she staggered back. The wound on her stomach has already healed.\nAustin stood there, the dagger from his stomach now lying on the ground, and thanks to his rapid regeneration, he wasn't bleeding anymore as well.\n\"You thought only you could deceive people, huh?\" Austin grinned, hands crossed.\nHe was relieved that the Death Disguise worked as a wonder. She didn't suspect a thing.\nThe Demoness suddenly remembered something as she turned towards the nearby soldier, \"Capture that man! He should not be-\"\n\"Oh, he is already liberated.\" An uninvited guest appeared in the hall, making Ameytr flinch.\nShe turned towards the violet-haired witch who was levitating mid-air with a casual demeanor.\nHer presence caused the cylindrical tank to vibrate with energy. The ground quivered as Astaroth showed fury upon realizing who was involved in this.\nSelner turned towards humanity's greatest adversary before she said, \"Oh, hello Astaroth. I must say, that's quite a glow-up you got there.\"\nThose blood-red eyes seemed to be wanting to eat Selner alive. But naturally, other than radiating the untamed miasma he possessed, he couldn't do anything in his current situation.\nTurning back to the Princess, Selner said,\n\"Adam has already been sent to a safe location, so you can't possibly bring him back here.\"\nAmeytr clenched her fist, her body shaking with frustration and anger. She couldn't believe that despite being so close to her goal...despite having her prey in her arms, she failed to slaughter him.\nIt was the highest degree of failure one could incur. And she...she has embarrassed herself in front of her father.\nNo, this was wrong...this was unacceptable. She can't...she... doesn't deserve this...she can't live with the tag of a failure....no more...no more...\n\"I will kill you!!\"\nHer mouth opened wide as the scream erupted, dark magic twisting her voice into a monstrous echo. The sheer pressure made the air shake. Austin covered his face, teeth clenched, trying to bear it.\nHis feet skidded backward across the cracked floor, facing the crushing aura of an S-rank head-on. His skin burned under the weight of the darkness. His eyes barely stayed open, and hot tears spilled down from the heat.\n\"Agh... fuck!\" Austin roared as he summoned his mace, tilting his body to dodge the surge of power.\nWith all the strength left in his legs, he lunged toward the Demoness.\nHe moved slowly—his body heavy, like it was dragging chains—but he didn't stop.\nDemons around them had already collapsed. If not for the glowing barrier cast around the recovery tube, the Demon Lord inside would've been flung out by now.\nSelner frowned, eyes narrowing with concern. Was he really trying to fight her like this? It was madness. He didn't stand a chance.\n'If it gets worse... I'll just grab him and run.' She clenched her jaw, never taking her eyes off him.\nAustin kept going. Gritting his teeth, he raised his mace and slammed it down on the Demoness with everything he had.\n\"Screw you!!\"\nDHAK!\nThe spiked mace slammed into her shoulder—and the miasma wavered.\nBut she didn't flinch.\nHer body stood still, her sharp teeth showing through a wicked grin, black smoke trailing from her burning eyes.\nShe raised her hand—calm and cold—and grabbed the handle of the mace.\nTINK.\nCRACK.\nAustin's eyes went wide.\n\"No...\"\nBefore he could pull it back, she crushed it—just like that.\nAshen Maul fell apart. Shattered. Turned to dust right in his hands.\n[Ding!]\n[Your connection with your weapon 'Ashen Maul' has been severed.]\n[The soul of Ashen Maul will now return to the depths of the abyss.]\nAustin read the system messages through blurred vision.\nHis heart sank.\nTo others, it might be just a broken weapon.\nTo him, it was a friend. A brother in battle. One he fought with through hell and back.\nThe Demoness smirked, loving the look in his eyes.\nShe stepped forward, ready to end it—\nBut suddenly, Austin bit down on his thumb, blood dripping down his skin.\n\"Austin...\" Selner gasped. Her voice shook. \"What are you doing?!\"\nEven the Demon Lord twitched inside the recovery tube, his eyes wide with alarm.\nOnly Ameytr stood confused, watching her father react to something she didn't understand.\nAustin raised his right hand slowly. His breathing was steady. But his rage was not.\nIt boiled. It boiled like a storm about to break free.\nSelner screamed, \"Stop!! You'll die if you do that!\"\nBut he didn't listen.\nWith blood on his lips, he muttered in a low growl,\n\"Hear my command... come to me—Scar.\"\nAnd just then—\nA deep voice echoed in Ameytr's ears. Her father's voice. Full of terror.\n[...Run!]\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Ah~finally, it's here. Austin's true Shard. The one that even destroyed the Demon Lord.\nHaah~it's going to be fun writing the next chapter.",

The one who shone brilliantly and gave humanity a ray of hope.\nAnd that warrior...has returned. Carrying the same weapon and wearing the same light which pushed Astaroth to the brink of his demise.\nScar.\n°°°°°°°°°\nThe castle trembled as Austin used his newly acquired skill, 'Soulwarden Veil', and summoned his weapon.\nNot the two daggers he always wields but something more profound...something that shook the very foundation of the castle and caused Ameytr to quiver in dread.\nSelner's eyes were parted wide in shock. There was no denying it...the curved sword he held in his hand...was his favorite form for his Shard.\nIt was the Shard that defeated every mortal and rose through the rank. The Shard was just unmatched and was praised as the arm of a deity.\nShe cannot be mistaken about it. That presence...that raw energy it was radiating. There was no denying it. It was the Scar.\nAustin gripped the sword tightly, his knuckles pale.\nThe blade had a black, wave-like pattern running from the handle to the tip, as if shadows were trapped within it, writhing. It wasn't flashy. No glow, no shine. A sword even a beginner weaponsmith might craft.\nHowever, he could feel it. The way his soul combined with the weapon made it feel like the Shard was an extension of his body.\nIt drained him—hard. Just staying idle pulled in his Soul Energy like a starving beast. Each second, it devoured ten times more than he had.\nIf not for Soulwarden Veil, Austin would've dropped dead right then and there.\n\"Austin!\" Selner shouted and instantly, Austin looked ahead—Ameytr a few feet away from him—lunging at him with her claws extended.\n*Ba* *Dum*\nHis heartbeat spiked.\nAnd then—\nWithout thought, without reason—\nHe swung.\nA clean, sharp motion. Nothing extra.\nSWIIISH\nThe sword cut the air.\nNot towards her. She wasn't even close enough to be hit.\nBut her body moved anyway.\nA reaction?\nOr perhaps a prey's instinct?\nEither way—\nIt saved her life.\nSHLIIIIK\nA thin line of blood danced across her cheek.\nShe stared, frozen.\nThe slash missed her body—\n—but it didn't miss the castle.\nCRACK—BOOM—CRUMBLE\nStone split.\nThe far edge of the castle—\nGone.\nTorn off like paper.\nOne slash.\nJust one.\nAnd the castle lost a corner of its body.\nDetached.\nAnd not just the castle, the sky was split by that slash as well.\nAmeytr stared at the open sky with her eyes widened.\nWhat's with the absurd strength?!\nAustin himself couldn't believe the ability of the Shard. He has never seen a Shard with such an overwhelming ability. Not even Shiverfall has such brutality in it.\n\"This is insane...\" Austin grinned, looking at the Shard which hummed in response.\n\"Stay focused!\" Selner's voice rang again before Austin looked up and found Ameytr summoning a black orb that definitely meant to harm him\nAustin didn't think twice before slashing the sword again.\n*SHLINK*\nThe ground split as the shockwave of the slash advanced toward the Demoness.\nAmeytr was fast enough to move right after she launched the prematurely released spell.\n\"How can it split an intangible thing?!\" Ameytr couldn't believe her eyes. It was a spell made to erode anything and everything...yet it was dismantled as if it were just a smoke cloud.\n\"This is insane.\" Austin ignored her, enjoying the insanely strong Shard in his hand.\n\"You can change its form as well,\" Selner advised, much to Ameytr's dread and Austin's astonishment.\n\"That so?!\" Austin immediately willed the weapon to take the form of a hammer.\nIt vibrated, and the consumption of Soul Energy just surged higher, but since he had endless Soul Energy at the moment, he didn't mind.\nA white light covered the sword before it slowly changed its form according to Austin's will.\nAustin held the huge hammer in his hand, which, despite its size, was easy to lift. The weapon felt too comfortable in his hand.\nAmeytr didn't stand there and mentally commanded her army,\n\"Attack!\"\nRows of demons began to fill the room; the whole place started to appear small as hundreds of demons began to surround Austin.\nIn response to that Austin didn't show a single sign of being cornered.\nHe stood there, his wrist resting on top of the hammer's butt as he waited for them to fill in.\nLooking at his cocky stance, Selner couldn't help but sigh, \"Some things never change...\"\nThe whole main hall was now filled with demons.\nAustin stood in the middle—the only human in the castle.\nEvery demon growled aggressively, ready to charge and stomp the human to death.\nSeeing his nonchalant response, Ameytr gritted her teeth. But there was no point in hesitating. She was going to end him right here!\n\"CHARGE!\" She barked while extending her hand toward Austin.\n*GUOOOOOH*\n*ARRRRRGHHHH*\n*UGHOOOOOOO*\nEvery demon and demonic beast charged toward the human, their weapon raised, teeth bared and eyes filled with blood lust.\nThe ground trembled under their weight. The room was filled with Demonic energy. The victory seemed just inches away from Ameytr's reach. But then—\n\"Heh~\" Austin twirled the hammer, and turned its head towards the ground before—\n**CRACK**\n—with all his strength, he slammed the hammer on the ground, and an explosion occurred.\n**DOOOOOOM**\nThe hammer struck the ground.\nAnd the world—ended.\nNo shockwave. No wind.\nJust—silence.\nFor a breath.\nFor a heartbeat.\nThen—\nBAAAAAAAAAAAANG\nReality shattered.\nA black dome of energy erupted from the point of impact, swallowing everything within a hundred meters in the blink of an eye. Walls evaporated. Stone turned to dust. Demonic energy, once thick in the air, was torn apart like paper.\nThe charging beasts never reached him.\nThey never even saw it coming.\nThey were gone.\nNot slain.\nErased.\nThe explosion didn't just destroy—it was unmade. A perfect sphere of nothingness carved through the castle, leaving behind a crater where life once stood.\nThe ground no longer shook.\nIt didn't even exist.\nDust fell like snow. Broken pieces of the ceiling rained down and melted in midair from the residual heat. The throne, the pillars, the demonic banners—everything that made this hall what it was… was now a memory.\nAustin stood at the center, smoke rising from his shoulders, his hair flicking slightly from the dying currents of force.\nHis eyes stayed cold.\nExpression blank.\nAs if what he'd done wasn't even worth reacting to.\nAmeytr's body was swallowed by darkness, the skeleton of her left side visible and the Demoness wobbling on her remaining body.\nShe stared at Austin with her eyes lifeless...her body trembled as she muttered, \"You....the...world shouldn't fear me...you...you are the...real monster...you don't deserve to live...\"\nAustin rolled his eyes as he approached the Demoness.\nHis Soulwarden ability was about to run out so he released Scar from his hold—missing the sensation of the weapon already.\nStanding before the Demoness, he told her, \"Your army is dead. You are about to die. And all that happened before your father...I don't find anything more embarrassing than this.\"\nAmeytr didn't feel provoked...she couldn't feel anything at the moment. After what she has seen, all her emotions seem to have been wiped off.\nLooking at him, she uttered her last few words, \"Mark my words...that power...will cause you everything you desire to protect...and only you would remain in the end...all alone...all de-\"\n*SQUELCH*\nAustin stabbed her using his dagger, silencing the Demoness as her body faded into nothingness.\nIt was a weakness on his part...because of what she was saying, Austin started to imagine it. He didn't know why.\nSoon Selner approached him and rested her hand on his shoulder, \"Are you okay?\"\nAustin took a deep breath and nodded, \"Yeah...it was quite a day, but I think everything is fine now.\"\nSelner noticed that even though he tried to sound casual, his eyes betrayed him.\nHe was shaken up.\nBut then again, the power he wielded just now would surely leave some aftereffect on him.\n'I hope this doesn't end up like the last time...'\nNot so long after Selner brought Austin back to the human realm. And after arriving the first news Austin heard was,\n\"Valerie fainted?!\"\nJust as he heard the blue-haired lady's words about where she was resting, Austin didn't think twice before charging toward the nearby medical center.\nHe used the ring to locate her, and the way it was glowing, clearly signified that she was in distress.\nHe rushed through the gallery, crashing into people but not stopping to apologize.\nThe previous indifference and precision of a warrior faded. All one could see on his face right now was panic and anxiety.\nNot the Demoness nor the Demon Lord made him this nervous as Valerie's condition did.\nHis heart continued to race until he reached the room where the ring led him.\nAnd once his eyes landed on her...\n\"Finally, I found you.\"\n....he knew everything was fine.\n°°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I hope you are not dissatisfied by his powers.

      "content": "It was one of those days when Austin was staying over at Valerie's house. They actually planned to stay only for a few days, but since her parents wanted to spend some more time with her, Austin urged her to delay their departure.\nThat evening, they sat together in the back garden of the mansion, sipping tea.\nIt was one of Valerie's favorite places. After a long day of training, she often came here to wind down—her favorite tea in hand, watching the sun dip below the horizon. It was peaceful. Familiar.\nBut now, that peacefulness feels warmer than usual. She wasn't alone. She was sharing the table with the person who mattered most to her.\nAnd they weren't drinking her usual tea.\nMilk tea.\nAustin's favorite.\nHe watched her closely as she took another sip, hope flickering in his eyes. To him, tea without sugar was like music without melody. And since Valerie had once loved sweet things, he secretly wished that this taste would bring back a little of that old fondness.\n\"How is it?\" he asked, trying not to sound too eager.\nValerie gave a small nod. \"It tastes good... the sugar is low, so it's manageable.\"\nAustin smiled, but inside, he sighed. That was her polite way of saying she wasn't a fan. He didn't want to push her—especially not over something like this.\nHe looked down at his cup, quietly deciding he'd go back to her tea next time.\nA moment passed. Then, Valerie spoke again.\n\"Can I ask you something?\" Her voice was softer now, with a flicker of hesitation.\nAustin raised his eyes, meeting hers. He nodded. \"Of course.\"\nShe looked at him for a few seconds longer, as if weighing the risk of the words she was about to say. It wasn't an easy question. In fact, she had avoided it for a long time. It was the one thing she feared might pull them apart if it wasn't handled gently.\nBut if she didn't ask, it would just keep spinning in her mind, never letting her rest.\nSo she took a breath.\nAnd finally asked.\nSo she finally asked, softly, \"The lovers you had in your previous life... did you love them?\"\nAustin froze. The words hit like a cold wind brushing past his heart.\nHe had told her before—briefly—that back when he was Luke, he'd been in a few relationships. But he hadn't expected her to bring it up, let alone ask something like this. Especially not Valerie—who always avoided the things that might hurt her heart.\nBut now, she was looking straight at him, her eyes steady but unsure. It wasn't just curiosity. There was something deeper. Something she was holding back.\nHe leaned forward slowly, resting his arms on the table. \"Back then,\" he began, \"I was really into the idea of teenage romance. I was popular, especially because I played sports. So... if someone seemed to like me and I found them interesting too, we'd start dating.\"\nValerie leaned back slightly. She nodded, but under the table, her hand tightened into a fist. Maybe it was the thought of him sharing soft words or glances with someone else or something else that made her feel so...\nAustin noticed her quiet reaction but continued.\n\"But... it never really lasted. Most of them figured out pretty quickly that I wasn't into casual relationships.\"\n\"Casual relationship?\" she asked, tilting her head slightly. The term was unfamiliar to her.\nHe smiled gently, appreciating her honesty. \"It's a kind of relationship where people just date to show off—to take cute pictures, go out together, enjoy the moment… but they don't really try to understand each other. It's not serious. Not like... this.\"\nValerie frowned, trying to process it. \"Then… why didn't they just call it friendship? Isn't a relationship supposed to be serious? Something close to the heart?\"\nAustin's eyes softened. \"I used to think the same way. But… their idea of love was different. I didn't want to change myself just to match that. So… we broke up.\"\nHe gave a small, dry laugh. \"Not just once. I had seven breakups. All ended at most after two months of dating.\"\nValerie blinked. She had heard that number before. But hearing it again, especially from him so calmly, still left her stunned.\nSeven.\nHe lowered his head, staring at the cup in his hands as he spoke again, voice quieter now.\n\"That's why... when I heard about a girl who had been hurt, ignored, and still waited for someone who never looked her way... I couldn't stop thinking about her. Not because I pitied her. But because she still loved, even when it wasn't returned. She didn't chase someone for attention—she just… stayed true.\"\nHe looked up, his eyes meeting hers with a quiet, burning sincerity.\n\"I was captivated. By that strength. By that kind of love.\"\nValerie couldn't suppress a smile upon hearing his words.\nThe appreciation from him seems so genuine that even if this was an attempt to appease her, she didn't mind.\n\"And when did you fall for me?\" Valerie asked, in a voice that reflected her curiosity and elation.\nAustin looked up at her, eyes lifting gently as he spoke with a quiet, vulnerable smile.\n\"That day… when I saw you wearing that birthday cap, singing the birthday song just for me… I think that's when it hit me.\" His voice lowered. \"There could be no one else but you. I just knew. And that feeling—it was absolute.\"\nIt wasn't just a sweet memory to him. It was something that healed a wound he had carried for two lifetimes.\nIn both lives, his birthdays had been nothing but a quiet reminder of how ignored he was. Whether as Luke or as Austin, his parents never paid attention to that day. Birthdays were supposed to feel special, but for him, they were the loneliest.\nEven so, he still liked cutting a cake. He liked the idea of receiving gifts—because deep down, he still wished someone would remember.\nThat's why, when he stepped into the room that day and saw the cake she had baked, the decorations she had set up, the gift she had wrapped with her own hands… he didn't just smile.\nHe fell.\nFell for the kindest, most thoughtful girl he'd ever met.\nValerie rested her elbow on the table, her cheek cradled in her palm, eyes fixed on him with a warm smile. Her gaze had a softness that pulled him in—so much so that he couldn't bring himself to look away.\nThen she asked, with playful curiosity, \"Tell me, Austin. Am I prettier than your past lovers?\"\n\"There's no comparison,\" he replied without pause. \"You took my breath away the first time I saw you.\"\nSome answers feel rehearsed. Others come from the heart.\nValerie could tell—his words were real. That was why her face felt so warm all of a sudden, her cheeks blooming with a pink hue.\nShe looked down, her heart pounding a little faster.\n\"Do you enjoy yourself when you're with me?\" she asked quietly.\nAustin leaned forward slightly. \"Have you ever seen me wish I was anywhere else? I could stare at your face for hours and never get bored.\"\nThat did it.\nValerie dropped her gaze to the table. She couldn't keep asking him things like that—her heart wouldn't survive the answers. Her hands were fidgeting now, her chest fluttering like crazy.\nThen, without a word, Austin stood up. He circled the table, and before she could ask what he was doing, he lowered himself onto one knee in front of her and gently took her hand in his.\n\"Val,\" he said, looking straight into her eyes, \"I know I've made mistakes. I've been in relationships before, and I might've looked like someone unworthy of your love. But you… you showed me what love really means.\"\nHe held her hand a little tighter.\n\"Don't ever compare yourself to the people from my past. You are the most lovable and kindest person I've ever known.\"\nValerie's eyes softened. She didn't need time to think. She didn't need words to process.\nShe simply got down on her knees too, wrapping her arms gently around his neck and pulling him into a hug.\n\"I know,\" she whispered close to his ear. \"And you're the most precious person to me as well, my Lord.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "\"Mm…\" Valerie let out a soft groan in her sleep. Her throat felt dry, and the discomfort stirred her awake.\nSlowly, she opened her eyes. For a moment, she stared blankly, but then—bit by bit—the memories came rushing back. The moment she lost consciousness… the fear… the chaos…\n\"Uh!\" She tried to sit up in alarm, but stopped midway—something was holding down the duvet covering her.\nShe turned her head slightly—and her breath caught.\nThere, resting beside her bed, was a man. His head lay gently on the blanket that covered her, his eyes closed, and his breathing calm. His lips were slightly parted as if he had fallen asleep waiting.\nAll the panic that had been bubbling inside her vanished in an instant.\nHe was here. Safe.\n\"Hah…\" A breath escaped her lips, and she sank back into the bed. Her strength, which had flared up for a moment, faded again.\nWith slow care, she reached out a hand toward him.\nHer fingers ran gently through his hair. \"You worked hard,\" she whispered.\nShe didn't know yet whether her father had made it back. But knowing that this man—this person who cared about her—had risked his life to find her… it left a deep ache in her chest.\nShe felt guilty. Guilty for how she behaved, for making him worry, for driving him to take such a dangerous step. But that guilt was drowned out by the quiet joy blooming in her heart.\nShe already knew he cared.\nBut moments like this—when she could see it, feel it—made her heart overflow with warmth.\n\"You are awake...\" Suddenly, a familiar man entered the room.\nValerie's eyes widened slightly as she looked at her father, \"F-Father...\"\nAdam slowly approached her bed and rested his hand on her head, \"Yes, I am back. Sorry for keeping you worried.\"\nValerie pushed herself up and wrapped her hand around him, tears welling up her eyes.\nThese past few hours were like hell for her. First, she received the news that her father was abducted by the demons and was taken to the other side. And then, Austin went after him.\nValerie was shaken down to her core. She was helplessly trying to reach them, however, a damn woman came in her way.\nThis was the second time in her life that she was reminded of how helpless she could become.\nFirst, in front of that Demon General who erected the barrier to weaken her. And this time that Council warrior who stood in her path like an unshakable wall.\nAdam softly patted her back and assured her that he was fine now.\n\"Valerie… you know,\" her father said gently, \"if I had been in Austin's place, I'm not sure I would've done the same. Risking my life just because my fiancée was worried… That kind of courage—it's not something I've seen in anyone before.\"\nValerie slowly pulled away from him and turned to look at her father. His eyes, filled with quiet warmth, were fixed on the man still resting beside her.\nWhat Austin had done wasn't bravery—it was closer to madness. The mission itself was a gamble with death. No one could say what lay on the other side. Maybe the Demon King's generals. Maybe the entire demon domain. The odds were impossible to measure.\nYet Austin had gone. Not only that—he offered himself up as a hostage without flinching.\n\"…Father,\" Valerie spoke softly, \"did something happen to him while he was there? Was he hurt?\"\nHer voice trembled slightly, worry wrapped in every word.\nShe still remembered that awful moment during the battle, when her heart clenched and the world seemed to collapse. Like something terrible had happened—and she couldn't do anything about it.\nAdam paused.\nHe didn't answer right away. A quiet hesitation settled in the room as he looked at his daughter.\nHe thought about telling her. About what Austin did in front of the Demoness. About how he sacrificed himself just so she wouldn't cry.\nBut seeing her like this—so worried, so fragile—he couldn't bring himself to say it.\n\"No,\" he finally said. \"Nothing happened to him. I was taken away by the Council Advisor, so I don't know much… But from what I heard, he somehow broke through their defenses and made it out.\"\nThe truth was—no one really knew what happened. Not even Adam. Austin had collapsed from exhaustion the moment he returned and had been sleeping ever since. No one had pressed him for details.\nHis answer came quickly enough. But there was a pause—just a few seconds—before he spoke.\nAnd that was more than enough for Valerie to know.\nHe was hiding something.\nBut it didn't matter. She would ask the one person who could never lie to her.\n°°°°°°°°°°\n[Austin's POV:]\n....where the f*ck am I?\nI looked around and found it was a familiar place...the Valorian Academy.\nI was standing in the common hall and was summoned here out of nowhere.\n'This is a dream...for sure...'The way people were going past me without noticing me, it was obvious that this was a dream...or maybe more like a memory. Since I haven't watched such a vivid dream where I could think properly.\nLooking around, I suddenly spotted Rhea.\nShe was sitting at the table with a book in her hand, but her eyes were directed at someone else.\nI followed the line of her sight....and was startled to find a very familiar face.\nIt was no one else but me....so this, indeed, is a memory I received after wielding Scar.\nValerie was sitting beside me but I didn't have much focus on her. I was reading a book while leaning back on the seat. My hair, which was quite long, was tied in a rough ponytail. My eyes lazily focused on the book.\nLooking around, I found there were several girls who were looking at me, many of them giggling and whispering things that were directed at me.\n\"Would you like me to fill the tea?\" Valerie asked softly as she picked up the teapot.\n\"Mm-hmm.\" ...and I didn't even bother to thank her or even look at her.\nValerie smiled... uh, is it bad to feel a little jealous here? I mean, that person is me but still...\nValerie was quietly pouring tea when—\nTHUMP.\nA loud slam shook the table, making her frown. Tea spilled slightly at the rim of the cup.\nA stranger stood there. He looked young—clearly a student from the academy—but his face was twisted in rage, eyes burning red.\n\"You bastard! How can you—agh!\"\n\"Uh…\" Valerie gasped—and so did I.\nIt all happened too fast.\nWithout even sparing him a glance, Austin picked up a fork from the table and flicked it.\nThud.\nThe metal sank into the guy's chest with terrifying force. Only a few inches of the fork remained visible.\nHe… he just stabbed someone.\nCalmly, Austin closed the book he'd been reading and set it down beside him. Then, with a voice colder than ice, he spoke:\n\"That could've stabbed your heart, Markus. So watch your mouth when you speak to me.\"\nHis gaze finally lifted—and when it did, the air in the room changed. His eyes were sharp, unfeeling, and deadly.\nA weight pressed down on the common hall. No one dared move. Even Valerie visibly flinched under his aura.\nMarkus stood frozen, trembling, blood slowly staining his shirt.\nThen—Austin's eyes turned toward me.\nThat one glance made my heart skip.\n\"You're still here?\" he said softly. \"It's not time for you to know everything yet.\"\nAnd with a snap of his fingers—\nWhoosh.\nThe world around me collapsed.\nI felt my body get pulled away, my senses drifting. Everything blurred as the world faded from sight.\nSomewhere in the back of my mind, I heard my own thoughts echo faintly.\n'My previous self… really was something else.'\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I mean...Selner did say that he was a completely different person and once he regained the other fragments, their personalities would merge.

      "content": "\"I am quite surprised that, as a King, you can leave the capital so often,\" Austin spoke those words which took everyone by surprise. Only Sebastian chuckled.\nLooking at his son with a sense of betrayal, Cedric said, \"I was worried about you and now you are showing disappointment in me?\"\nAustin sighed, \"I always tell you that your family comes after your Kingdom.\"\nCedric shook his head. \"Your words don't change anything. The moment I heard you went to the other side, I just felt like I needed to be there with you.\"\nAt that moment, Cedric wasn't a king—he sounded exactly like a stubborn father who refused to let his son shoulder all the burden.\nFeeling his wife's gaze, Austin turned to her. She was gently shaking her head, her eyes quietly pleading, Don't say anything.\nAustin let out a soft chuckle and gave a small nod. Wives always knew best.\n\"By the way, Austin… you looked like you were in a really deep sleep. Everything alright?\" Adam asked from across the table, his voice calm but curious.\nAustin's smile faded. That dream—or whatever it was—came rushing back.\nHe had seen another version of himself. One who had never tasted failure. One who moved like the world belonged to him.\nThat Austin was something else.\nThe way he carried himself—it was admirable but also a little unsettling. Still, after everything Selner had told him about the different timelines and what those versions of him had gone through, maybe that kind of confidence made sense. He really did have the strength to back it up.\nLetting out a quiet sigh, Austin answered, \"I pushed myself too hard during the battle… I just wanted to get out of there as soon as I finished what I came for.\"\nOf course, he couldn't tell them the truth. That he'd wiped out a thousand demons in a single strike. Even Valerie might not believe it unless he explained the reason behind such an impossible feat.\nScar.\nA weapon unlike anything he'd ever known. It wasn't just powerful—it was terrifying. A tool that could wipe out every race on the planet if it fell into the wrong hands.\nBut when Austin held it… it was like something inside him clicked.\nAs if Scar had been waiting for him.\nAs if it was happy to be back where it belonged.\n'I should thank the system for rewarding me the skill which allowed me to use Scar...' If not for the skill—Soulwarden Veil—he wouldn't have thought of using that God-slayer.\n\"The medic checked on you but she didn't detect anything wrong. Do you feel alright, son?\" Cedric asked with a frown of concern on his face.\nAustin nodded, \"Yes, I'm alright now. That heavy feeling is gone. And now that Valerie's back on her feet… I feel like myself again.\"\nTell Austin that Valerie is in danger, he might commit a grave mistake in a winning battle. He knew it was a weakness on his end but he couldn't find a way to overcome it.\n'Guess, that's the side effect of loving someone so excessively,' he mused.\nValerie smiled fondly at her Lord as she felt her whole being wanting to hug him right now. But she can't.\n'Control Valerie...he isn't running away...'\n\"Ah, by the way,\" Austin began, gathering others attention, \"How is Mother? I heard she fell unconscious?\"\nFor a moment, when he heard the word 'mother' a hope flickered in Cedric's heart that Austin might be asking about Sophie...however, that flickering hope died when he heard his following words.\nHowever, he didn't let his grief appear on his face and heard Adam saying, \"Yes...the moment she saw me, she lost control over her emotions, and...well, she is fine now.\" Adam told them.\nSeeing his wife cry could never feel good to a man who loves his woman. And Adam was no different.\nHe tried to calm her down, but she continued to weep while clinging to him, and soon, she fainted.\nShe was currently getting treated and Adam was checking on her every ten minutes.\n\"I hope she recovers soon.\"\nAfter that, they continued to have dinner while chatting about casual things.\nThey had a long day yesterday and today, too, so everyone decided to finish dinner and call it a day.\nIt was already too late so Cedric was requested by the Duke to stay here tonight.\nThe King, undoubtedly, sent a WarpMail back home, assuring his wife that their son was fine.\n\"Okay then, Austin. Good night.\" Adam came to see off his son-in-law at the room's door.\nAustin wryly smiled and told him, \"Good night, father.\"\nHe really wanted to join Valerie but he won't take a chance for another few minutes until the man of the house doesn't settle in his room.\nApproaching the window, he asked the system,\n\"You got any reward for me?\"\n[Ding!]\n[Upon reaching another milestone in the Trickery department, the host has gained a reward.]\n[Tap to open]\nAustin was surprised, \"So the tool I used, which I gained from Trickery, to fool others gained me a reward?\" The Death Disguise was a reward he gained upon reaching a certain milestone in the Trickery stats.\nAnd he used that pill to fool not only the Demoness but the Demon King himself.\n[Indeed, host. Once the System grants you a reward, it becomes yours completely. The Death Disguise was your tool—choosing to use it at that exact moment was your own wit at work.]\nAustin hummed with a nod; well, he was not going to reject a free gift.\n'Open the gift,' he said as he jumped out of the window.\n[Divine Mockery: It can bzzt-zz-bzzt-zzz....i-zzht-*screech*]\nAustin paused, completely stopped in his tracks as he saw the system screen flickering.\nHe grew tense as he asked, 'System?'\n[The system is being blocked by an unknown force.]\n[Need reboot.]\n[Force reboot is about to begin in 3....2...1..]\n[The system is rebooting.]\n[Time required: 12h 59min 57sec]\nAustin was dumbfounded...this was the first time he had seen the system acting like this.\nAnd what external force can disturb the system?\n'That skill name...was it something related to Gods?' Austin was curious but he was more worried about the system.\nHowever, despite trying to ask anything, the system wasn't responding at all.\n'I hope you recover soon, my friend.'\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"So many things happened...\" Valerie muttered under her breath as she rested her head on his arm and snuggled closer to her beloved.\nAustin told her the whole story, of course, omitted that part where he stabs himself. Thankfully, Adam also didn't say anything about that incident or he doesn't know how Valerie would have reacted.\n\"It was...overwhelming. I felt I could achieve anything with that power.\" Austin spoke in a daze, his eyes locked on the ceiling and mind recalling the power he felt while holding Scar.\n\"It explains now,\" Valerie suddenly spoke, \"The reason you can change the shape of your Shard better than others is that your original Shard allows you to mold your soul in any form.\"\nHer words were met by a thoughtful nod from his end.\nIf Scar has the ability to change the form completely, then he can change the size of the Frost Fang according to his will. After all, Frost Fang is also a part of his soul.\n\"Did you discern the ability of your Shard?\" Valerie asked with a curious look in her eyes. She has always been interested in his affinity. In her mind, Austin always had an affinity for thunder, so she was expecting that.\nHowever, \"....as far as I could guess, it was Darkness.\"\nValerie was taken aback, but she didn't say anything to interrupt him and heard him adding, \"The energy that erupted from my Shard devoured everything around me. I still can't be sure but my Shard's ability is unique.\" And terrifying.\nHe refrained from adding the last part to not make her worried.\nAustin felt certain hollowness when he looked at those dead bodies as if he was detached from everything and was just here to finish the job. That's why Ameytr's words about Austin getting abandoned in the end affected him so much.\nA power so terrifying that can make you hesitate to use it.\n\"Hey, look at me,\" Seeing his growing concern, she rested her soft hand on his cheek and made him look at her.\nThose violet orbs contained evident warmth that broke Austin's train of thought and forced him to focus only on her.\nValerie was inches apart from him, that's why her hushed voice reached him clearly, \"Whatever happens from now on, we will be on it together. You don't need to shoulder the burden alone. I know I can fall short at times, but I will improve myself to stand beside you.\"\nAustin's heart was filled with warmth at those words, but soon a soft smile got her curious, \"What is it?\"\nAustin slowly shook his head and said, \"I used to think like that in the not-so-distant past.\" Austin always pushed himself beyond limits since he knew he had to put extra effort into protecting Valerie.\nHowever, things have changed now. And Austin has mixed feelings about this.\nKissing her head, he softly spoke, \"Just as you never abandoned me, I also would never even think of leaving you behind. For better, for worse...in sickness and in health, I want you to be by my side all the time.\"\nValerie couldn't explain the feelings she was experiencing right now. She felt the safest in his arms. The happiest when he whispers sweet things in her ears. And the luckiest to have this man as her partner.\nThey have overcome the moments of separation. Now she was going to cling to him with her life.\n°°°°°°°°°°\n\"Haa…\" Rhea exhaled softly as she stood atop the old watchtower, gazing down at the quiet town below.\nThis was the place where she grew up. The place where her memories lived—being chased by hens, laughing with the neighborhood kids, getting scolded by her mother, strolling through the market with her father. Each moment tucked away deep inside her heart, like pages of an old, worn book.\nBeing here brought it all rushing back.\nMorkel stood quietly to the side, watching the peaceful expression on her face. There was a softness in her eyes that made him smile.\nA sudden gust of wind made Rhea shiver. It was colder up here than she remembered.\nBut before she could say anything, she felt something warm drape over her shoulders. She turned to her left and saw her teacher smiling at her.\n\"It was a bit too much for me anyway,\" he said casually. \"Please carry it for me.\"\nRhea's cheeks flushed as a small smile curved her lips. The warmth of his coat didn't just touch her skin—it reached deeper, wrapping around her heart.\n\"Thank you,\" she murmured, voice barely above the wind.\nMorkel gave a small nod, and for a while, they stood there in silence. A silence that felt calm, not awkward. Just the two of them, sharing the view and the moment.\nThen Morkel spoke, \"Do you want to have a place here? I asked around, and you don't need a citizenship proof to buy a house.\"\nHe believed, deep down, that Rhea might want to stay. This place seemed to bring her peace. And it was close to the academy too—it made sense.\nRhea took a slow breath, then shook her head. \"No… I won't come back here again.\"\nMorkel turned to her, surprised. But he didn't speak. He waited.\n\"This place,\" Rhea continued, \"pulls me into the past. And those memories… they'll only make me sad. They'll tempt me to hold on, even if it means losing the present. I want to move forward. I want to grow. And nothing should stand in the way of that. So thank you… for bringing me here. But this was my last visit.\"\nMorkel blinked, taken aback. Not just by her words, but by the strength behind them.\nShe didn't want to be held down by grief. She wanted to walk ahead, even if it meant letting go.\n\"Admirable,\" he said quietly, the word slipping out before he could stop it.\nRhea's face turned rosy, and she looked away, coughing lightly.\nMorkel quickly cleared his throat, embarrassed. That sounded so weird... he scolded himself. \"So… shall we head down?\"\nRhea nodded. \"Yes, let's go.\"\nAs they made their way down the narrow stairs, Morkel leading the way, he heard her voice behind him.\n\"Thank you, Professor. Not just for bringing me here… but for staying.\"\nHis steps slowed for just a second before he smiled to himself.\n\"Once, you saved me,\" he said gently. \"I'm just returning the favor.\"\nJust returning the favor… That was the only lie he allowed himself.\nBecause if he ever told her the truth… she might not look at him the same way again.\nA quiet sigh escaped his lips.\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "\"Really...what's the rush? You just returned today and are leaving already.\" Cedric complained as he looked at his daughter-in-law.\nValerie smiled apologetically as she said, \"We have already missed a few days at school, and there is a ceremony tomorrow, so we decided to head back.\"\nTomorrow was the congratulatory ceremony where those students would be awarded who performed well in different fields. Originally, this event always remained more focused on congratulating those students who performed in the tournament, but things would be different this time.\nValerie had high hopes that her Lord would receive a reward for his bravery, too; that's why she ushered him to return today rather than tomorrow.\nShe didn't want to miss the chance of seeing her beloved getting the recognition he deserved.\n\"Haah~you children are restless.\" Cedric heaved a sigh with a shake of his head.\n\"In their age, you were also quite energetic, my Lord,\" Sebastian added with a playful smile, making Cedric groan.\nIn the reception hall, there was another person who had been sitting silently ever since.\nThe Queen.\nShe had a warm smile on her face, and from her eyes, it could be seen she wanted to add a few things to their conversation, but she always restricted herself.\nWell, Valerie wouldn't surely ignore her, but her opinion about the woman hasn't shifted much. She still feels anger toward the Queen for what she has done...for how she has treated her son for the past ten years.\nSuddenly, Sophie glanced at her husband, before Cedric nodded and gestured towards the maid.\nThe said maid stepped forward while carrying a tray, and on the tray were several wrapped boxes.\n\"This...\" Valerie asked in confusion as she took the tray. From what she could tell, it was lunch boxes.\n\"These are a few snacks which Sophie made-\"\n\"...why?\" Sophie spoke for the first time, interrupting her husband with a delicate frown.\nCedric exhaled a long breath, \"As you can see, she doesn't want Austin to find out that she made them or he won't eat.\"\nValerie smiled softly at that as she lowered her eyes and said, \"As far as I know him, the first bite would let him know who prepared them.\"\nSophie was taken aback by that response....does he really remember how her handmade food tastes?\nValerie didn't reject the lunchboxes since she could trust the lady enough to believe that she hadn't poisoned the food.\n'But still...I will have the first bites...' She inwardly decided.\nSophie again turned towards her husband and told him something wordlessly.\nHowever, Cedric, this time, rejected her unsaid request, \"You give it to her, yourself.\"\nSophie pleaded but to no avail. Cedric was not going to let this chance slip away. Even just a little, he wants Sophie and Valerie's distance to lessen.\nLost to her husband's stubbornness, Sophie got up from her seat and gestured toward the maid who was holding a box.\nIt was a polished wooden box on which the emblem of Eryndor was crafted.\nThe Queen approached the girl, and just when Valerie was about to get up, Sophie gestured for her to remain seated.\nOpening the box, she took out a golden bracelet with a twisted design and a dark blue stone in the middle of it.\nValerie raised her hand when Sophie asked for it and the Queen inserted the bracelet in her hand, \"This is the family heirloom, passed down the generations. I wanted to give you this a long time ago...but...\" Sophie didn't continue to speak but Valerie understood everything.\nNaturally, after Aiden's arrival, she must have thought of keeping the heirloom for Aiden's wife.\nWith her gaze lowered Sophie slowly said, \"I know I have disappointed you and Austin...but let me be shameless and bless you.\" Cupping her cheek, Sophie said with her eyes moistened, \"May you always remain together and happy.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nAustin was currently in a different room on a different floor.\nHe was sitting across from his sister who still refused to look at him. But the very fact that she didn't disapprove of him to enter her room was quite hefty progress.\n\"I know it's unfair that I couldn't stay here for long-\"\n\"I didn't even ask you to stay.\" She said in a grumpy tone.\nAustin didn't mind her words; she had the right to badmouth him as much as she wanted. He has ruined her childhood and never apologized until a few days ago.\nHe deserved all her hatred but what he couldn't tolerate was her locking herself up.\nGetting up from his seat, he approached the little girl and crouched before her.\nHolding her hands, he told her, \"Look at me, Avy,\" he ushered her, but she didn't.\nAustin still continued, \"I have ruined years of your life...by saying those things...and not apologizing. But now, it's time to move on.\"\nAveris snatched her hands away, showing clear rejection.\nHowever, Austin again held her hands and added, \"You can't destroy your life like this Avy. You can't let anyone else ruin your life and force you to keep yourself locked. Even if the person in question is your brother.\"\n\"Why do you care what I do with my life?\" She asked, her eyes holding countless emotions. Anger, frustration, grief...hatred.\nAustin's shoulders slumped as he took a brief moment to collect himself before he said, \"In this family, only you were who never lost hope in me. It was you who never gave up on me...call it paying back if you want but now I don't want to give up on my sister. I am regretful for what I have done...but now, I want to change things.\"\nHearing his words, Averis's shoulders trembled.\nHow can she not remember those days when she spent her days researching Shards and how one could improve them just so she could help him?\nShe never celebrated her own awakening, never responded to any of her parents' calls, and continued to research.\nSo when he said that she never lost hope...she actually didn't.\nTears welled in her eyes, her body trembling slightly as she tried to stifle her sobs.\nAustin hugged his precious and softly patted her head, \"I am sorry...you have suffered a lot.\"\nAveris clung to him and wailed aloud. The pain she has been suppressing...the anger boiling inside her, everything just exploded.\nIt took him some time and Austin waited patiently for his sister to calm down.\nShe felt embarrassed, for giving in so easily.\nWiping her face she saw him getting up.\nResting his hand on her head, he said, \"I have already handed the admission application to the academy. In a month would be your assessment so prepare well.\"\nAveris frowned, \"Academy?\"\n\"Yup~you are going to be my junior, Avy.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Sitting quietly in the carriage, the two of them were on their way back to the academy.\nRudolph had already returned from the Dukedom two days ago after checking up on them. Thanks to Austin's request, he had most likely arranged a letter of absence on their behalf.\nThey sat in a gentle silence, holding hands as they watched the scenery pass by outside the window.\n\"Did you convince her?\" Valerie asked softly.\nAustin didn't need to ask who she meant. He replied with a quiet sigh, \"I think I did. But I'm not sure if she'll actually put in the effort.\"\nValorian Academy's assessments were harsh. Even though Averis had the talent, she had spent most of her years shut inside her room, wasting away the time she should've used to grow stronger.\nIf she didn't give it her all, she wouldn't make it in. And not even the King's influence could change that.\n\"I think she'll manage,\" Valerie said after a pause. \"In case you didn't notice, she's been heading into the forest to hunt.\"\nWhen Austin had shown up in front of her, the bloodlust she gave off had been intense—too real to be faked. It was the kind that only came after someone had been through enough pain to turn a maiden into a warrior.\nAustin gave a half-smile. \"Let's hope so. If things go wrong... I'll figure something out.\"\nHe had no idea what he could actually do if she failed, but he wasn't about to let his sister fall behind without trying everything he could.\n\"Quite the responsible brother, aren't you?\"\nBoth Austin and Valerie froze. The seat across from them, which had been empty just moments ago, was now taken by a familiar figure.\nValerie narrowed her eyes, her voice sharp. \"Can you respect our privacy?\"\nHer words were calm, but her tone carried a clear warning.\n\"You two are either fighting or clinging to each other. I figured this was the safest time to interrupt,\" Selner said, settling in with zero shame in her voice.\nAustin let out a slow breath, giving Valerie's hand a light squeeze before speaking. \"Was he caught?\"\nSelner gave a single nod. \"I had more than enough proof to drag him straight to the torture room. But… the moment he tried to speak about the Lord he served, his body exploded.\"\n\"Just like that demon...\" Valerie whispered, recalling the gruesome end of the demon who died before the Vice-headmaster could question him.\n(A/N: That was from the impostor demon trio arc.)\nBy now, Valerie knew the full truth—the traitor in the council, the one who had opened the gates for the Demoness to enter human lands and kidnap her father.\n\"The council's taking it seriously now,\" Selner continued. \"They've started full-blown interrogations. Everyone's under scrutiny—even the Council Heads.\"\nAustin's expression tightened. \"What about you? You know more than most. If they squeeze too hard and the truth slips out… it won't end well.\"\nValerie felt her chest tighten at the concern in his voice.\n'Why is he so worried about her…?'\nShe said nothing, but the question lingered in her mind.\nSelner smiled faintly, unaffected. \"They won't risk questioning me. Not unless they're prepared to lose everything I bring to the table. I just helped them catch one of their own. That earns me more than a little trust.\"\nThere was no way they could interrogate her. Not Selner.\nShe didn't just carry knowledge of the past—she held secrets of other worlds, truths too heavy and dangerous for any mortal to bear. If they ever managed to pry into her mind… this world could end up facing something far worse than the Demon Lord himself.\nA heavy silence followed. The only sound inside the carriage was the rhythmic turning of the wheels against the road.\nAustin finally broke it. \"Madame Selner, do you know what my Shard can actually do?\"\nSelner gave a soft hum. \"Since you only used it for a short while, it's no surprise you don't fully understand what Scar is capable of.\"\nShe leaned back with ease, crossing one leg over the other. Her tone remained casual—even playful—as she said, \"From what I've seen, Scar can cut through anything. Doesn't matter if it's physical, magical, or something in between. It can extend the range of its slash, too.\"\nAustin leaned forward slightly. \"How far?\"\n\"Far enough to split a planet,\" Selner replied, completely deadpan.\nThe silence that followed wasn't as soft as before.\n...Split a planet?\nAustin blinked. Valerie turned to her with wide eyes.\nWas she joking? She didn't look like she was joking.\nSelner continued calmly as if she hadn't just dropped a bomb. \"It also has a Devour Zone. Inside it, all flesh and blood are pulled into Scar—only bones remain.\"\nAustin reached back and rubbed his neck, frowning. \"So that's what happened back then...\"\nThe memory hit him hard. That grotesque scene—the field of twisted, empty corpses—made sense now. It hadn't been a fluke. Scar had done that.\nValerie raised her brows, clearly curious. \"How many abilities does his Shard have?\"\n\"I don't know actually. Although I took him back in time, I wasn't around when Austin decimated the demonic army.\"\nTalking about the past, \"Were you the one who helped him send my soul into a different world?\"\nSelner shook her head, \"I have command over time, not Space. It was my sister...the only one whom I trust.\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"Witches have some broken powers huh...\"\nSelner shrugged, \"We are the beings who ensure that some knowledge and civilizations never go extinct. So naturally, we would have such skills to play our role.\"\nAustin was interested in knowing more about the Witches and what knowledge they actually preserve. But he knew his boundaries so he stopped talking.\nSelner soon told them, \"I will keep an eye on things on both sides and keep you two updated. Just don't expose your knowledge to others or that won't end well for any of us.\"\nValerie and Austin nodded at the same time before Selner disappeared.\n\"Young Lord, we are here,\" Sebastian's voice reached them before Austin and Valerie looked outside and found that they had reached the Academy.\nSeeing the familiar castle brought a smile to his face as he extended his hand toward his lady and said, \"Shall we go?\"\nValerie's lips curved in a smile as she rested her hand on his before nodding, \"Let's go.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Austin and Valerie went their separate ways, deciding to rest for tonight and meet tomorrow for classes.\nThere was only the homeroom tomorrow before the students would be allowed to return to their dorms.\nTomorrow, there will be visits of the juniors with their parents who might be enrolling here. Following that, there would be a ceremony to congratulate those who have performed well throughout the year.\nThese rewards actually help one to get better jobs once they graduate since the merit points are reflected in their final results.\nSuddenly, Austin had a thought—if he had a normal life, what might he have done after graduation?\n'With my skills and interest in hunting, being an adventurer or Council Officer might have been the best job.' Council might be a dangerous place for many considering it is the first pillar of defense for humanity, but a warrior's might is wasted if they continue to hesitate from entering the battlefield.\nHowever, there was no point in thinking about it, considering Austin knows his future.\n'Eight months...canonically, it would happen in eight months.' Around that time, all the generals would become active, attack the human realm, and prepare for the arrival of their liege.\n'Before that, I need to restore my memories anyhow.' The fact is, Rhea never fought with the Demon Lord. Austin died before reaching the conclusion. So, until now, he was completely unaware of Astaroth's strengths and weaknesses(if there are any).\nHis last visit to the other realm told Austin that Astaroth was still too weak. However, Selner told him not to try to damage him at that moment...for some reason which she kept to herself.\n'She is a woman with mysteries.' Heaving a sigh, he slid into the bathing pool.\nThe warm water engulfed his body, bringing out a sigh of relief.\nDue to continuous travel, his body was extremely fatigued. Not to talk about, his visit to the dungeon yesterday.\nNow, he was left with only the main boss of the Third Dungeon.\n'Hey, system, according to you, how many dungeons would it take me to reach A-rank?'\n[Ding!]\n[By the completion of the fifth dungeon, you will break through your current rank and reach the A-rank.]\nAustin heaved a sigh, 'So two more challenges, huh?'\nIt was quite a tedious journey, to be honest. How many months has it been? Around four months ago, he started his journey from D-rank and now has reached nearly the A-rank.\nHe has fought several opponents higher in rank. Killed his bastard brother. He has slaughtered two S-ranks. He has made some friends. He made out with Valerie twenty-seven times. Went on thirty-six dates. Patching things up with Averis.\nSo many things happened.\n'Haah....feels nostalgic.' After a brief pause, he asked the system, 'What exactly happened to you last time?'\n[The system is still trying to find the source of the disturbance. For safety purposes, the latest reward has been sealed until the system doesn't ensure complete protection against another invasion.]\nAustin frowned...what in the world could be attacking the system?\nHe has no knowledge of where the system comes from or whether there was a person working behind the screen to help him.\nOut of curiosity, Austin asked, 'Tell me something, were you with my previous version too? The one who had all the Soul fragments?'\n[Yes, host. I was with you then as well. However, you never utilized me since you deemed me useless...]\n...Austin might be imagining things but he felt sorrow in those words.\nWell, considering how strong he actually was, naturally, the challenges the System had in store must have bored him.\nAustin warmly smiled as he said, \"But you helped me a lot this time so thank you for that, system. Even after I gain my other fragments, I promise to always keep asking for your help.\"\n[Thank you host ๑>ᴗ<๑!]\nAustin chuckled as he pushed himself up and got out of the resting spot.\nWiping his body he wrapped the towel around his waist and entered his room.\nWalking out, he wore loose-fitting trousers and was about to put on the shirt when,\n*Knock*\nAustin paused. Then smirked.\nThinking it might be Valerie and how fun it would be to see her reaction, he approached the door.\nShirtless.\nJust before opening the door, he breathed against his palm to ensure his breath wasn't stinky.\nOnce he was done, he opened the door, with a sweet greeting on the tip of his tongue—but then,\n\"...why are you here?\" He frowned, seeing three men standing there.\nRyan, Sheldon, and Rudolph.\n\"How rude. We came to check on you.\" Ryan complained with his arms crossed on his chest.\nAustin heaved a sigh, before giving them some space, \"Come in.\"\nRudolph entered the room and said, \"Hope you have some snacks in your kitchen.\"\nRyan entered soon after, followed by Sheldon.\nHowever, just as the silverhead was about to walk past him, he teasingly whispered, \"Were you expecting someone else with that get-up?\"\nAustin was struck speechless hearing that, his eyes widened.\nSheldon mischievously stated, \"As the vice president, I think I need to fulfill my duty and punish the one who doesn't follow rules.\"\nAustin rolled his eyes and pushed the guy inside before closing the door.\nRudolph sat on the bed while Sheldon and Ryan took the chairs.\nAustin stepped toward the kitchen to brew some tea for the others as Ryan began to speak,\n\"This beautiful girl in my class, the one I had a crush on for some time, approached me today.\"\n\"Heh~\" Austin grinned, \"Even you have a crush on people, huh?\" Considering what a battle junkie the third year is, Austin thought he might not let his mind wander in different directions.\nRyan snickered, \"You think only you can have a love life.\"\nAustin chuckled at that reaction, before Rudolph asked, \"So what did the girl say? Asked for a spar?\"\n\"Man...you only think about fighting all the time, no?\" Sheldon shook his head with a tired expression.\n\"I mean...I have only been approached with that reason in mind by those girls. So I thought his case might be the same?\" The big guy replied as he took the cup which Austin offered.\n\"I also thought that it was a challenge to a battle. I already had thought of how I would be impressing her and all...but I was wrong. So...so wrong.\"\nThe guy's shoulders slumped as he informed them, \"She didn't approach me for a battle...but a task much more difficult.\"\n\"To pretend to be her boyfriend or something?\" Austin asked.\n\"Or maybe be her brother?\" Sheldon teased.\nRyan shook his head, his eyes droopy, as he informed them, \"She asked me to be her dance partner.\"\n\"....\"\nEveryone turned silent.\nWas dancing that difficult?\n\"You all are nobles so it's not difficult for you. I come from a small family!\" Ryan defended himself. He could literally see their thoughts on their faces.\nSheldon chuckled, \"You never took any town girl to a date or something?\"\nRyan heaved a sigh, \"I never thought of dating someone until I reached the academy. But that's not the problem here.\"\n\"You want to learn how to dance?\" Rudolph asked with his arms crossed.\nHe also has got himself a dance partner for tomorrow and the funny part, Rhea was behaving the same as Ryan when he asked to be his partner\nRhea also doesn't know how to dance.\n\"It's nothing difficult, truth be honest. Come here, I will guide you.\" Austin volunteered as he got up from the bed.\nRyan rested the cup on the table and got up.\nHe was about to move toward Austin but the blond noble crossed his arms in rejection, \"You can't approach your partner like that. It's uncool.\"\nRyan stiffened... is there a way to approach your partner, too?\nRegardless, he didn't question anything and nodded for him to continue.\nAustin stood upright before he extended his left foot slightly, and his back leaned a little.\nHis left hand extended toward Ryan and his right hand behind his back.\nWith a graceful posture that made the other two also take notes, Austin asked, \"May I have the pleasure to share the dance floor with the lovely lady?\"\nThat grace...those words....\"Now wonder you got your lover head over heels for you.\" Sheldon was impressed.\nRyan, on the other hand, offered his hand to Austin and they drew closer.\n\"Now, where will be your hand?\" Austin asked.\n\"On your waist?\" He asked hesitantly. He had never seen many couples dancing before, so he was unsure.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Just below your partner's shoulder blade.\"\nRyan nodded before he rested his hand at the spot, \"Like this.\"\n\"Slightly up...yeah. Just keep it there.\" Austin rested his hand on Ryan's shoulder and told him, \"Now move with the rhythm-\"\n*CRACK*\nEveryone in the room froze.\nAn ominous sensation reached them.\nThe glass of the window cracked as someone, peeking from outside, lost control over her emotions.\nAustin slowly turned his eyes—and looking at those hollow eyes of his fiancée, he felt a sense of panic rising.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- It was an instinctive reaction, no misunderstanding.

      "content": "Austin was getting ready to leave for the ceremony.\nHe wore a black suit—just as his lover had insisted—a black waistcoat, black pants, and a white shirt. His hair was neatly styled and combed to the back of his head, ensuring he looked presentable.\nAs he fastened the cuffs on his wrist, he couldn't help but ask the system, \"Tell me something. Is there really no way to bring Ashen Maul back?\"\n[No, host. Every weapon provided by the System has its own sentience. A soul is infused into them during forging, and once broken, they can never be the same even if the fragments are reattached.]\nAustin let out a heavy sigh. \"You could've told me that earlier. I've risked Wisp so many times…\" Ashen Maul had been the newest addition to his arsenal. After fighting alongside it in several battles, a bond had formed—one that was deeper than he could've imagined between a warrior and their weapon.\nAlthough Austin already has the thought of summoning Scar, Ashen Maul's destruction is the reason why he was pushed off the edge.\nNow that he knows that his weapons are destructible and cannot be restored, he would be a little extra careful.\n*Knock*\n\"It's me, young master.\"\nHearing the familiar butler's voice, Austin told him, \"It's open.\"\nThe doorknob was twisted before the familiar person stepped inside with a soft smile on his face.\n\"You look...good, sir.\"\nHearing his words caused Austin's brows to go up, \"Why the pause?\"\nSebastian glanced at his young master once more before quietly saying, \"Excuse me for a moment.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, he stepped behind Austin and swiftly removed his coat.\nAustin was taken aback but didn't stop him.\nTo his surprise, Sebastian went further, carefully taking off the waistcoat before helping him slip the coat back on.\nAs if that wasn't enough, Sebastian picked up the comb and began to work on Austin's hair.\n\"Sebastian...?\" Austin's voice was filled with confusion.\n\"You aren't dressed to match your age, sir,\" Sebastian replied, his tone respectful yet playful. \"You're young and handsome, so let's not hide that under a formal dress code.\"\nSebastian stood behind Austin, the comb gently running through his soft, slightly damp hair. He parted the strands down the middle, arranging his glossy blond hair with a deliberate yet relaxed touch, leaving it just a little messy.\nWhen he finished, he stepped aside, giving Austin room to take in his reflection in the mirror.\nAustin blinked, surprised to see that he actually looked better.\nHe nodded in approval, then turned to Sebastian. \"Thanks for the makeover, Sebas. I really appreciate it.\"\nSebastian bowed softly. \"Enjoy yourself at the party, sir.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nAustin walked down the dormitory and headed toward the fountain near which Valerie always waits for him.\nHe could sense many people glancing at him...maybe because of what happened during the tournament or maybe it was the appearance? Regardless, he was already quite used to all those gazes.\nHe silently walked towards the fountain, eager to see Valerie's reaction—however, the moment his eyes landed on his girl, he slowly and to a halt.\nValerie had already noticed him, and seeing that reaction brought a smile to her face.\nValerie wore a stunning black frock gown that hugged her figure with quiet elegance. The dress had full sleeves that wrapped around her arms like silk, adding a graceful charm to her presence. A gentle, low cut began from her chest, modest yet alluring, and the gown flowed all the way down to her ankles.\nShe has braided her long hair in a high bun, using the hairpin he gifted her, to keep them in the pace. Her face was touched with light makeup, and her lips appeared red and supple.\nThe black color made her look both powerful and graceful, like a shadow dancing under the moonlight. Her look was simple—but impossible to ignore.\n\"I need a glass case....can't let the world see you.\" Austin's words were heartfelt and contained the sudden rush of love he felt upon seeing the girl.\nIs he really worthy to stand beside her? She is so damn pretty!\n\"That's ...a very strange thought.\" Valerie giggled as she drew closer to him.\nThe perfume she wore was quite profound around her, making him intoxicated.\nOnce she was inches away, she seductively whispered, \"But I am no different either. Seeing you, the first thought I had was, 'I need to lock him up and prevent the world from seeing him.'\"\nAustin's breath was caught in his throat as he looked down at her.\nThose full red lips were quite tempting to his eyes.\nHe slid his arm around her delicately shaped waist and gave her a soft kiss.\nValerie was taken aback by the kiss since there were many people around.\nBut rejecting her Lord was never an option.\nShe hugged his neck, leaned her head, and deepened the kiss.\nIt was a sight worth creating a sketch.\nA handsome man and a beautiful woman, standing under the pleasant moonlight, having an intimate moment.\nThey complimented each other so well that rather than feeling envious, people admired them.\nSoon, they reached the ceremonial hall, with their arms hooked.\nValerie was not used to wearing heels, that's why Austin was taking slow steps.\nIf earlier people were glancing at him, now people were stopping in their tracks to look at the duo.\nThe ceremonial hall was not packed, but yes, it was crowded.\nStudents from each year were invited today. More than five hundred students were gathered around, involved in group chats.\nThe servers were moving about, changing the empty glasses and serving the students with snacks and different dishes.\n\"Oh, hey. How are you Austin.\" The one who greeted them was the Student Council President, Annabelle.\nShe was wearing a red one-piece dress that reached her knees. She has tied her hair in a ponytail, appearing younger than usual.\nBeside her was the familiar silver head, wearing a white suit with a black shirt.\n\"I am good, how about you, Prez?\"\nAnna rested her hand on her stomach and said, \"Can digest things now,\"\n\"Joking about the injury...really, Anna?\" Sheldon sighed. He really doesn't want her to remember about it...considering how deeply that day has traumatized her.\nAnnabelle shook her head, \"Unless I don't regularly confront it, the memory won't go away.\" Her logic was...sound but Sheldon still showed reluctance.\n\"President, you will be graduating soon...have you thought of what job will you pick?\" Valerie asked with her brows raised.\nAustin picked two fruit drinks from the passing waiter's tray before handing one to his lover.\nAnnabelle hummed, her finger pressed against her chin in a typical thinking pose, as she said, \"I can join my father's business and help him. However, that sounds too boring.\"\n\"Wait...you really haven't thought about it?\" Austin was perplexed. His and Valerie's situations were different and they have more than a year to think about their career after graduation. However, Annabelle would be leaving the school in a month...yet she seems unsure about the direction she wants to take.\nAnna grinned as she said, \"Well if I become an unemployed slacker, a certain someone will certainly take care of my needs,\" Her body leaned slightly toward Sheldon when she said that.\nSheldon's ears turned red as he scoffed but didn't try to reject her.\nSoon, they went their ways, Anna and Sheldon meeting other people while Austin and Valerie took a corner and just looked at the people.\n\"I've never seen you so excited about joining a celebration before,\" Austin's soft voice reached her.\nShe glanced at him and noticed he was still looking ahead, though his eyes held a smile.\nValerie moved a little closer, the warmth of his presence calming her, before speaking softly, \"I want to see the moment when my Lord is recognized for his bravery and discipline. Call me a fool, but I want those who've spoken ill of you in the past to see how far you've come—how they were left behind while you soared ahead.\"\nOnly Valerie could be so passionate about someone else's achievements and scornful toward others because they behaved inappropriately to her fiancée.\nAustin tilted his head towards her before asking, \"And what if I don't get rewarded?\"\nValerie's eyes turned cold as she flatly stated, \"Then this would be my last day at the academy.\"\n...Austin was taken aback. How closely he knows her, he guessed that she wasn't talking about leaving the academy if they didn't appreciate Austin's efforts. Rather, she would end up committing something that would ban her from entering the academy.\n...now, Austin really hoped that he would get even the smallest achievement tonight.\n\"May I have your attention please,\" suddenly, someone appeared on the stage and gathered everyone's attention.\nIt was the Headmaster.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "The students stopped chatting and looked at the man.\nThe ceremonial hall was built in such a way that the person on stage could reach each corner of the hall without elevating his pitch.\n\"We have gathered here today to celebrate the year we have spent at the academy—a year filled with countless memories, both joyful and difficult. Each of you has faced your own trials, learned your own lessons, and grown in ways that will shape the path ahead.\nThis journey has never been easy, and it will only grow more demanding from here. But as warriors committed to forging a more peaceful world, we must face these challenges with resolve and courage. Let adversity be the fire that tempers our spirit, not the weight that breaks it.\"\nFollowing the suit, everyone raised their glasses to cheers on that.\nPhilius lowered his glass and said, \"Now, let us extend our congratulations to those individuals who have distinguished themselves through exceptional skill and unwavering dedication. Their achievements are a testament to what is possible when talent is sharpened by relentless effort. They have not only earned recognition—they have become names worth remembering.\"\nPhilius gestured towards the Professor on his left before she stepped toward the stage and handed one of the many boxes she was holding on a tray.\nPhilius opened the box before calling out, \"First, I would like to congratulate the students who have succeeded in conquering every dungeon she was sent to. Not only did she manage to bring down her adversaries within the time allotted, but she also ensured the safety of her comrades.\"\nWhen those words escaped his lips, many people already started glancing in Austin and Valerie's direction\nAnd as they expected, \"Please join the stage with me, Valerie Corwon.\"\nA round of applause filled the hall as they turned towards the violet-haired.\nAustin gave her hand a gentle squeeze, his face full of smiles as he said, \"Let's go.\"\nValerie softly nodded before they headed toward the stage\nUpon reaching the small flight of stairs, Austin gave her a nod and detached his arm from her.\nValerie stepped onto the stage and approached the center.\nThe older one opened the box and showed her the medal, as he said, \"You did a great job.\"\nValerie thanked him with a smile and took the box.\nOnce she stepped down and rejoined Austin, the Headmaster continued with the ceremony, calling out people for their achievements.\nValerie was slightly restless as the ceremony continued.\nShe has already counted the boxes. Slowly the number was decreasing.\n\"Next, I would like to congratulate the brave boy who has not lost a single spar since he joined the academy. Please join me, Rudolph.\"\nValerie exhaled a long sigh which caught Austin's attention.\nLeaning closer, he whispered, \"You do know that no one else's opinion matters to me.\"\nValerie didn't respond to him since she knew he was telling the truth\nBut this single time she was hopeful that her Lord would be awarded for his bravery. He has received only scorn and hatred all his life. But no more.\nFinally, the last box was left, and the headmaster began, \"Now, I would like to call the person who has shown great dedication toward the academy, helping the students and uplifting the school's reputation.\"\nValerie clenched her fist, hopeful that this should be it.\nBut, \"Please join the stage, Annabelle.\"\n\"...huh?\" A frown marred Valerie's face when she heard that name.\nWeaving through the crowd who applauded for her, Annabelle made her way towards the stage.\n....why? Why did the Headmaster also ignore him? Are they blind? Or retard? How can they not appreciate what Austin has done for them? He helped catch the demon, risked his life to bring a truce between two nations...and even fought against an army.\nIs this not enough? Should he actually slay the Demon Lord to actually get recognized?\n\"Valerie...\" Austin called out in concern seeing the dark expression on her face.\nHe was about to pull her away, before she ended up doing something, when suddenly,\n\"Now, onto the last award,\" Everyone was surprised to hear that. Wasn't the ceremony over? All the awards have been distributed already.\nRegardless of their reaction, Philius continued, \"The one who has demonstrated extraordinary growth in an astoundingly short span of time—so much so that it made me question the worth of my own experience.\"\n\"The one who dared to risk his life against adversaries that, had I faced them at his age, I might have fled from.\"\n\"The one who stood against deceitful imposters, endangering himself to prevent what could have been a catastrophic loss of life.\"\n\"A true Hero—who cast aside all regard for his own safety and stood alone against an army, driven solely by his will to protect his people.\"\nA glimmer of hope appeared in Valerie's eyes upon hearing that\nMany students have already guessed who the person could be that's why they were glancing in their way once again.\nBut the one at the center of their attention was Austin this time.\nAnother Professor brought a golden sword, sheathed in a golden sheath, and appeared on the stage before handing it to the Headmaster.\nPhilius gave him a thankful nod before calling out, \"Please grace everyone with your presence, Eryndor Austin.\"\nA thunderous applause echoed through the hall as everyone turned towards the blond Prince.\nThe one who barely managed to make his place in the academy. The one who gained the title of the 'Useless Prince'.\nThe one who was destined to drown in depression and be forgotten by everyone.\nAustin was ..quite overwhelmed by the sudden announcement and attention.\nFeeling the tug on his sleeve he turned toward the only person who could put his heart at peace.\nHer eyes were moist but the beautiful smile declared how happy she was at the moment.\nHooking her arm with his, she said, \"Let's go?\"\nAustin exhaled a long breath before nodding, \"Okay.\"\nThe crowd made way for the duo as they walked on the red carpet and advanced toward the stage.\nAustin turned towards his lover, and heard her saying, \"I can't express how proud I am right now.\"\nAll Austin could do was smile before he took a deep breath and detached from her.\nStepping on the stage he stood before the Headmaster.\nThe older one rested his hand on Austin's shoulder and said, \"You have exceeded all my expectations. I wish you only continue to grow and make me and your parents proud.\"\nAustin, smiling, responded, \"Thank you, sir.\"\nPhilius nodded before he handed him the sword, which Austin took with both his hands, and his head lowered slightly.\nThe other started clapping once again as Austin turned towards them.\nAustin's eyes weaved through the crowd, but he wasn't finding Valerie.\nNear the entrance stood the grey-haired man who was smiling fondly and clapping just like others.\nTheir eyes locked before Austin's smile turned into a child-like grin as if to say, \"I did it, Sebas.\"\nThe butler's eyes turned crescent at the sight which he awaited to see for so long.\nAnd finally, his young master got the recognition he deserved.\n'I am proud of you, Austin.'\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "\"Exactly how nervous you were that you didn't join the celebration?\" Austin asked with his brows raised.\nIn the common hall, the four of them were having breakfast the next morning of the congratulatory ceremony.\nYesterday, because she was nervous to embarrass Rudolph Rhea actually didn't join the event.\nThe pinkhead's shoulders were slumped as she revealed, \"I actually was there for some time, but then my stomach began to hurt, so I decided to rest for a bit...\"\n\"Lies. You ran off just to avoid dancing with me,\" Rudolph scoffed, then shoved a thick bite of pancake into his mouth.\nThe sword user turned silent...unable to retort that since he was telling the truth.\nThe conversation didn't proceed in that direction anymore since no one was here to keep making Rhea feel guilty.\n\"Classes would start tomorrow. And the final exam is next month. Hah~the only period of the year where I have to focus on studies.\" Rudolph seemed tired already.\nTo proceed to the next year, one has to score at least the passing marks during the final exams. That's why, he couldn't slack off now.\n\"Yeah....it's quite annoying to revise all the notes. I wish I had brains like Austin.\" Rhea muttered enviously.\nAustin chuckled, \"When I wasn't so involved in all these, I used to study most of the time in my office.\" He informed them.\nUntil he didn't awaken the System, all he used to was finish the miscellaneous work given by his father and study books most of the time. Naturally, Austin having a strong foundation isn't surprising.\n\"Will you help me?\" Suddenly, Valerie asked in a hushed voice, which took Austin by surprise.\nWith a questioning look on his face, he turned towards her, \"You really need my help?\"\nValerie nodded, \"I have been too focused on training and have visited numerous dungeons this year to actually focus on the classes. Although I have the notes I don't think I can understand and learn everything before the exams.\"\nValerie was an academic genius too, along with her enviable physical prowess. However, the school syllabus was vast. She has been involved in a chain of incidents. Also, due to their recent closeness, Valerie couldn't focus on her studies at all.\nWhile she remains with Austin her mind doesn't wander in any direction but remains focused on him. And even after returning to her room, she keeps thinking about their conversation, which has hampered her studies recently.\nSo, in a way, Austin was accountable for her situation, so he better take responsibility.\nAustin smiled fondly at her, \"Okay, let's do it. My room?\"\nValerie nodded, this time energetically.\n\"Hey, are you two studying together?\" Rhea asked and the hopefulness in her voice clearly highlighted what she was about to ask further.\n\"Yes, but just the two of us.\" Valerie's answer was swift and looking at those cold eyes, Rhea stiffened.\nThere was clear rejection in her eyes, that completely wiped off all the hopes Rhea carried to be taught by Austin.\nRudolph heaved a sigh. \"You have been close to them for so long, yet you haven't understood that coming between them is a bad idea?\"\n\"But-but...they are going to study...\" Rhea weakly retorted.\nRudolph grinned, \"You think they will 'only' study?\"\nRhea turned speechless upon hearing that.\nShe turned her head towards the duo and saw them sharing the same plate, sitting with their shoulders touching and sweetly whispering things to each other—completely ignoring the world around them.\n...true, if they are together, there is no way they would only study.\nAfter a bit of pause, \"How about we ask Professor Morkel's help?\" Rhea suddenly suggested, \"I know he will help.\"\nRudolph's brows tensed for a moment, but then he relaxed his shoulders and said, \"Sure...let's do that.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nFar from the Academy, nestled near the base of towering mountains, lay a country renowned for producing the finest militants in the world.\nThis land blanketed year-round in snow, was best known not just for its warriors—but for being the largest supplier of weapons across the continent.\nOne of the world's greatest defensive powers.\nThe home of Auroracrest Academy—Ademerg.\nIts capital city, resting closest to the snow-cloaked peaks, was painted in endless shades of white. The rooftops sloped sharply, designed to shed the weight of ice and snow. People moved through the streets with practiced rhythm, shoveling snow from their doorsteps, bundled in thick layers of fur.\nMost of the shops were closed even though it was past breakfast time, but not because they were lazy. It's just that, very few visitors come to the capital around this time of the year.\nSome kind souls had lit coal fires in front of their homes, offering a brief moment of warmth to any traveler passing by.\nAt a glance, the capital of Ademerg seemed peaceful. The great castle where the King resided stood in silence like it always did. To the people, this quiet was reassuring.\nBut within those ancient stone walls, far from the public eye—\nA storm was quietly beginning to rise.\n\"The soothsayer?!\" The First Princess—Elizabeth Ademerg—gasped as she heard the news about the soothsayer.\nJust like every kingdom, Ademerg also has its future teller. However, they have not heard anything from her recently. Not even about the attack on the tournament venue. Or about how many students of Auroracrest were about to die.\nHowever, today, she got up, and while crying and shouting, she went to the storage room and locked herself in.\nNow, the first Princess, who was the ruling noble in her father's absence was heading toward the storage room.\nHer pale blue hair bounced with every hurried step she took toward her destination. The chief advisor and two knights followed closely behind.\nAfter crossing the long corridor she turned to her left and found several people surrounding a slim door where the cleaning supplies are stored.\nSeeing the Princess the maids and soldiers gave her the way.\nTurning toward the maid nearby, Elizabeth asked, \"How long has been inside?\"\nThe maid, with a frown of concern on her face, informed, \"She was having breakfast as usual in her room. I served her. But suddenly, she started behaving weirdly. Her face turned excessively pale, and her body trembled as if she had seen something disastrous. Despite how much I tried to ask what happened, she didn't respond, and suddenly, while wailing aloud, she covered her ears and ran all the way here before locking herself up.\"\nElizabeth bit her lip...something so devastating that the usually composed lady behaved so frenzied.\nTaking a deep breath, Elizabeth turned towards the door.\nDespite how scary it might be...she couldn't run away from her duties.\n*Knock*\nGently knocking on the door, Elizabeth spoke, \"Aurelia...it's me. Can you open the door for me, please?\"\nThere was no response, even though Elizabeth knew that the other party had heard her.\nPatiently, she continued, \"I know you have witnessed something horrifying ..something unprecedented...however, if you lock yourself up, your fear will turn into reality. So unless you don't want others to go through the same horror as you, please come out.\"\nElizabeth turned silent after that, her hand resting against the door.\nA few silent moments passed before,\n*Click*\nThe door of the storage room slowly parted and Elizabeth's eyes brightened...however, upon gazing at Aurelia's condition, she felt immense sadness.\nShe has plucked her hair and has vomited in the room. Her eyes were red and puffy and the woman was breathing roughly.\n\"E-Eli...it's coming...a disaster ..we cannot defeat...a demon...too big...too strong ...we need to run.\"\nElizabeth stepped inside the room; the foul smell didn't bother her as she knelt before the lady and asked her, \"When is it about to happen?\"\nIt was the sign of a great ruler: never panic in a dangerous situation, or the ones behind you will lose all their hope.\nAurelia took a strong gulp and informed her, \"In twenty days...\"\nElizabeth frowned ..this was too soon.\nRegardless, she turned toward the soldier and said, \"Go inform the council. We need to gather the ministers and discuss what we can do.\"\nThe soldier instantly nodded and dashed away.\nTurning towards the maid, she said, \"You. Go and bring me a letter pad and meet me-\"\n\"Elizabeth.\" Suddenly Aurelia grabbed her hand and prevented Elizabeth from further speaking.\nThe blue-haired Princess turned toward the woman before Aurelia spoke in a desperate voice,\n\"...unless we ask for her help we won't win this. I have seen it...the one who puts an end to the terror...it's only her.\"\nElizabeth asked in a low tone, \"Who?\"\nAurelia gulped, \"The one...who wields the Tool Of Destruction. The savior of Eryndor...and the one who will help us overcome this disaster—Valerie Corwon.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Remember the canon then you can guess who this foe is.\nThanks for reading.

      "content": "That night, Valerie arrived in Austin's room, completely unaware of what degree of danger she was liable to face in the near future.\nAt the moment, all she could think of was studying. Yes, she came here just to study!\nShe followed the usual routine of climbing the tree and jumped at his window before her Lord welcomed her.\nWordlessly, she approached the table and sat down before she opened the books.\nNo flirting today! She studying!\nAustin was in the kitchen, preparing something for them to drink as he asked, \"What subject are you having problems with?\" Naturally, he couldn't teach every subject with the small amount of time they had in hand.\nThat's why, he would be helping her with her weakest one.\n\"History,\" Valerie answered without much thinking. She even brought the books and notes on that subject alone.\nAmong the five subjects they had to study, History was the only one that Valerie couldn't tolerate for more than ten minutes.\nReading about the past, ancient languages, runes, and whatnot is just too sleep-inducing. Sometimes, when she can't fall asleep, she forces herself to read history, and voila.\nValerie has a strong command of the other subjects since they are more practical and the subjects include the field of her interest. Like things about hunting, dungeons, and weapons.\nAustin chuckled, \"The major problem of most of the students is that they read history as a subject. You need to take it as a story. The history we read is a continuous story starting from the great ancient war between the Demon Lord and Hero Kane.\"\nValerie grumbled, \"If they had recorded your deeds back then, then I might have thought of reading it.\"\nAustin shook his head helplessly, as he brought two cups of black coffee to the table.\nSome caffeine is needed since Austin has a feeling that they might be staying up late.\nResting the coffee on the table he sat down across from her and asked, \"I will give you some important terms and dates. Learn them since there is a high probability for those questions to be asked.\"\nValerie nodded with all seriousness as she extended the notes she had prepared.\nAustin took the papers and slid the ink toward himself before taking the quill.\nHe started circling the important topics he deemed necessary to be learned. He has read previous years' questions as well, so he knows what pattern they follow.\nMeanwhile, Valerie sipped on the coffee, and only tilted the cup enough to not hinder her eyes from gazing at her breathtaking man.\nAustin has taken a bath just now so his skin seems to be glowing. His lips are naturally slightly red. And that curly blond hair was falling down his forehead like a veil trying to hide his charm.\nAustin looks like those sculpted Gods people make with their imagination. He is just so divinely charming that Valerie could never get tired of looking at him.\n'His popularity has been growing recently...' it was a profound reason to be concerned. In the past, people didn't talk about him much, so she was safe. But after the ceremony, people have started looking at him more.\nAnd it was concerning.\nThankfully, Austin wasn't the kind of noble who preferred having more than one wife. However, she still needs to be careful. Who knows what kind of promise his father might have made in the past that might have forced Austin to have a concubine or something?\n'No, I can't let that happen...even if I have to abduct him and leave this nation...' Nothing was more important than her position in his life. In the past, she might have yearned for his slight attention, but because of how he has showered her with love, Valerie's expectations and demands have risen.\nShe wants to be his first and last.\n\"Hello, Hello. Can I talk to Miss Valerie?\"\nThe lady snapped out of her daze as Austin waved his hand before her face.\nEmbarrassed, she said, \"Sorry ...\" Wasting his time like this...not good, Valerie!\nAustin heaved a sigh with a shake of his head—not upset but slightly embarrassed...after all, being stared at by the girl he likes is kind of...exhilarating.\nAustin handed her notes back and told her, \"Please try to learn the points I have marked. I have omitted the lines which are unneeded and have starred those dates which are must-remember.\"\nValerie nodded diligently and started to read the passages that were marked.\nAustin picked up his coffee and watched his girl studying with her thin brows slightly drawn closer.\nResting his cheek against his palm he heaved a soft sigh and asked the system,\n'Isn't my wife adorable?'\n[Ding!]\n[She suits you!]\nThe system seemed excited.\n'By the way, system, what's my stats at the moment?'\n[Ding!]\n[Combat: 91/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Romance: 76/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[Durability: 93/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Trickery: 37/50]\n{Next reward at 50}\n[Overall Progression: 80/100]\n[Next Reward at 100]\n...\nAustin hummed...his stats reminded him that he hadn't been training much. And considering how close he has reached the breakthrough, the stats are moving slowly as well.\nThe only real challenge he could think of, which was accessible to him, was the Dungeon.\n'I will visit it tonight...' Class would be resuming tomorrow, that's why he couldn't oversleep. So he would just finish the main boss and return.\nA few more minutes passed as Austin reviewed his past rewards and chatted with the system when suddenly,\n\"This isn't working.\" Valerie spoke with slight frustration laced in her voice, \"I couldn't remember anything...there's just too much information.\"\nAustin hummed as he saw her fingers gripping the notes strongly—that showed that she was genuinely frustrated.\n\"Well, it's necessary for you to at least remember those points or you might not get passing marks.\" Austin reminded her. The five main subjects required one hundred and twenty points out of two hundred to mark a student qualified.\nHowever, Valerie doesn't seem to be progressing at all.\n\"I lack interest in this...\" Valerie covered her forehead and leaned her head down—depressed.\nAustin thought for a moment...she needs something to get interested in History, huh?\n\"Okay, let's do this,\" pointing at the front page, he said, \"You learn all the important terms of the first page within ten minutes, and I will reward you.\"\nHearing the word 'reward' made her flinch.\nShe looked at him with her eyes round and found Austin smiling mischievously.\nShe took a strong gulp and started to read again.\nThis time with evident eagerness in her eyes.\nShe still doesn't know what kind of reward he has in mind...but the thrill of the anticipation was enough to keep her going.\nAustin simply watched her devouring the lines, repeating the words she learned and continuing with the pace.\nAnd as he thought, the bait of reward worked.\n\"Done.\" She extended the papers in his direction with all seriousness on her face.\nAustin rested the notes on the table and asked, \"So tell me, what was the Foolish Act?\"\nValerie nodded and started repeating the words she learned, \"Soul Harvest was the Foolish Act which the humans a thousand years ago committed in the hopes of summoning a devil who would take down the demon king. They ...\" Valerie's words faltered as she saw her Lord slowly unbuttoning his shirt—causing her throat to turn dry, but she continued,\n\"....killed people in huge amounts thinking that it was the way to impress the devil....\"\nBy now, Austin has already unbuttoned halfway down, revealing his finely shaped chest.\nValerie took a strong gulp and shifted in her seat...wasn't this reward too tempting? She might forget her answers!\n\"Okay, now tell me: What is the Eclipse pact?\" Austin stopped to ask the question—much to Valerie's disappointment.\nBut to continue to enjoy the visual meal, she answered him, \"Eclipse Pact was one of the strongest Pact demons made under the solar eclipse where several subjects get—\"\nValerie paused, drawing in a sharp breath.\nAustin was already standing, his shirt tossed aside. Her eyes locked onto his body — those sculpted abs, the deep grooves running down to that sinful V-line. Each muscle moved as he stepped closer, like his body was made to tease her. It wasn't just hot — it was downright dangerous. Her mouth went dry. That wasn't a torso... that was temptation carved in flesh.\nNoticing that she has stopped speaking, Austin suggested,\n\"You want me to put the shirt back-\"\n\"Several subjects get into pacts with demons where they could influence their subjects with their mere thoughts!\" Valerie finished, not wanting the sight before her eyes to disappear.\nAustin chuckled, seeing her reaction before he told her, \"Now continue with the second page, and you can continue to gain your rewards.\"\nThat night, Valerie realized that she might just love History more than any subject.\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Damn...Austin can be a seducer for his lover.

      "content": "Austin was inside the dungeon.\nStanding inside the resting area. There were still two minutes left before he would be forced to take the battlefield.\nHe could see it....the dragon was waiting for him.\n[Name: Tharog]\n[Rank: B+]\nAn adult earth dragon waited for him to step out and fight it.\nMeasuring nearly 50 feet from snout to tail, its body is layered in rugged, stone-like scales that shimmer with the dull sheen of iron ore.\nIts limbs are thick and muscular, built for raw strength rather than speed, ending in massive claws capable of tearing through boulders.\nAustin is at least B-rank right now. However, the single degree of difference was quite huge. And this difference would only continue to grow wider as he progresses further.\nThe weapons he has right now are: WhisperWing, Raijin, God's Wrath, and his Shard.\nGod's Wrath was the newest weapon to his collection, something he bought in exchange for four thousand experience points.\nHe was left with something over two thousand points, which were enough to buy the next dungeon.\nThat's why, he couldn't buy any potions during the battle. He has to tread carefully and defeat this foe with whatever he has in possession.\n\"It's about to begin…\" Austin glanced at the timer.\nTen seconds left.\nHe kissed the ring on his finger. \"Wish me luck, Val,\" he whispered.\n[4...3...2...1—]\n[BZZZZZ!]\nThe siren blared, and in a flash of wind, Austin vanished from the cage.\nHigh above the ground, the Earth Dragon's slit pupils narrowed as it jerked its head back—just as a bolt of lightning cracked down where it had been.\nCRACKLE!\nAustin grits his teeth midair and hurls a Wisp straight for the dragon's eye.\nSWISH!\nThe boomerang spun with deadly speed—but the dragon dipped its head, dodging at the last second.\n\"Tch, it's reading my moves…\"\nAustin dropped back to the ground, skidding to a halt a few meters from the beast.\nThe Earth Dragon fixed its pale yellow gaze on him, pupils thinning to razor slits. Then it inhaled deeply—too deeply.\nGRRRRR…\nAustin's gut twisted. Wrong spot. I shouldn't be here—\nGRAAAAAAAA!\nA deafening roar exploded to his left—followed by a storm of wind and flying rock.\nMassive shards—long, jagged, and sharp enough to impale—came tearing toward him.\nHe ran. Full speed. Each breath burned in his lungs as he zigzagged through the onslaught.\nBut the wind—damn the wind—it kept throwing him off. His steps were shaky, forced, barely holding course.\nWHOOSH—CRACK! WHOOSH—CRASH!\nThe stones kept raining down. One grazed his shoulder, another smashed beside his foot.\nThen—shunk!\n\"Khuk!\"\nA sharp cry tore from his throat. One of the shards—thin, long, merciless—pierced straight through his thigh.\nHe stumbled.\nBlood soaked through his pants as he dropped to one knee, eyes wide with pain.\nHe looked at his wound, and at the same time, the rain of stones stopped.\nAustin's breath hitched, 'Damn it…' He shouldn't have taken his eyes off the enemy.\nTHUMP. THUMP.\nThe ground trembled.\nHe looked up.\nThe Earth Dragon was charging—fast. Head low, jaws wide, aiming to swallow him whole.\nAustin's instincts screamed.\n\"Barrier!\"\nTHWANK!\nA greenish wall of light flared to life right in front of him—just in time.\nBOOM!\nThe dragon slammed into it. The impact shook the air, but the barrier held.\nAustin's lungs loosened a bit. Thank God this barrier is actually Absolute.\nBut the beast wasn't stopping.\nTHWANG! THWANG!\nIt rammed again and again, each hit louder than thunder—but still, the barrier didn't break.\nAustin clenched his teeth. He gripped the shard lodged in his thigh, blood trickling down, and raised his left hand toward the sky.\nA second barrier shimmered into existence—this one above the dragon.\nThe beast felt it—its head jerked up, eyes wide—but it was too late. That massive body couldn't outpace a human's arm.\nDROP.\nAustin slashed his arm down.\nThe upper barrier crashed.\nBOOM!\nIt slammed onto the dragon's back, pinning the monster to the ground with a rumbling quake.\nDust shot up.\nThe earth quaked beneath them.\nAnd for a moment—just a moment—Austin had the upper hand.\nAustin yanked the stone spike from his thigh with a grunt and popped two vials—his throat burning as the potion slid down.\nHissss...\nRapid Regeneration kicked in, knitting muscle and skin back together. The pain dulled. But his head was spinning. Sweat dripped down his brow.\nNo time to rest.\nHe extended his hand—and a glowing barrier formed beneath the dragon. The one before him vanished.\nHis breath came hard and fast.\n\"Let's crush this thing.\"\nBut then—\n[Warning!]\n[Absolute Barrier has failed. Subject exceeds maximum weight capacity!]\nCRACK—SHHHK!\nThe green shield shattered into sparkling fragments, vanishing like dust in the wind.\nAustin's eyes widened. What?!\nThe dragon stirred, its massive head shaking off the daze.\nIt stood.\nAustin didn't freeze.\nHe summoned his twin hammers—crackling with divine energy. They thudded into his palms, burning with God's Wrath.\nWith a roar, he launched himself forward.\nThe dragon's eyes snapped at him.\nJust for a moment—man and beast locked eyes.\nThen—\nTWAAAAANG!\nHe clashed the heads of the hammers mid-air. The resulting shockwave was monstrous, a scream of sound that tore through the space between them.\nThe dragon reeled, claws scraping against stone, head recoiling in agony.\n\"GRRRRUUEGH!\"\nIt was wounded—physically, spiritually. First the crushing weight of the barriers, now the holy assault of the hammers.\nTHUMP. THUMP.\nIt staggered, eyes clenched shut, disoriented.\nAustin didn't wait.\nHe shifted, body blurring forward—but slower now. The potion hadn't restored everything. His leg throbbed with every step.\nThe dragon sensed the approach, eyes flying open.\nIt reared up, massive front paws rising—\n\"ARGHOOOOOOO!\"\nA guttural bellow ripped from its chest—thunder and fury in a single cry.\nThe human and the dragon were face to face.\nAustin had his axe raised above his head, thunder crackling around him.\nFire swirled before the parted mouth of the beast, its eyes filled with flames as it prepared for the final exchange.\nIt's now or never.\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- This battle won't be dragged on. I just wanted you all to know that he can go toe to toe with nearly A-rank now. Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"Are you okay?\" Valerie asked in concern as she saw Austin in a daze.\nHe has been like this since this morning—replying weakly, couldn't remain focused...it was the sign of being sleep deprived.\nAustin heaved a sigh and nodded, \"Yeah...just trained until late at night, and the adrenaline of the battle didn't let me sleep until dawn.\"\nAustin somehow slaughtered the Earth Dragon last night by using his skill, 'Berserk.' He had to enhance his stats to go against that beast which was just too overwhelming for his injured self.\nAlthough Austin had the upper hand when he switched to his Berserk mode, before that, it was a close battle.\nThankfully, Austin knows now that without any of his skills, he was at rank B.\n\"You should take it easy for now. As you said, there are a few months left before the Demon Lord would arise.\" Valerie voiced in a whisper, not wanting others to hear those words.\nShe knew that the world was at risk, and one of the few beings who knows what the future has to offer, Austin had to shoulder a very difficult job.\nHowever, if he continues with this pace, he won't be able to bring his best when it would matter the most.\nIn the past, Valerie might have boldly said something like, \"I'll protect you.\" But after being defeated twice—each time by opponents with far more strength and experience—she realized just how wide the gap was. There was still so much she didn't know, so much she had yet to master. And now, instead of making promises, she chose to focus on growing strong enough to keep them.\nAustin shook his head. \"Last night… it wasn't my strength that let me take on that monster. It was my ego,\" he admitted, his voice low, filled with regret.\nHe glanced at Valerie. \"Is it wrong to hate backing off?\"\nWhat he didn't tell her was that he could've escaped the dungeon. He had the chance to retreat, rethink, and return with a better plan. But he stayed. He fought. Because Austin couldn't stand the thought of facing the same opponent twice.\nHe didn't tell her that he lost his left arm in that fight. That the flames had scorched his entire left side.\nValerie stayed quiet for a moment, then softly asked, \"Is there something you can't bear to lose, no matter what?\"\nWithout thinking, Austin reached out and held her hand. His eyes said everything he couldn't.\nValerie gave a small nod. \"Then promise me something. If you ever feel like doing something reckless again… think of me. Think about how I'd cry—how I might break if something happened to you.\"\nAustin's face paled. \"Val… don't say things like that.\"\nShe smiled gently. \"It's not a threat. Just a reminder. You don't have to carry everything alone. Backing off when you need to—it isn't cowardice. It means you're strong enough to see the bigger picture. Winning a fight doesn't matter if you lose yourself in the process.\"\nAustin quietly took in each of Valerie's words. Then he gave a small nod. \"I understand. I'll be more sensible about things from now on.\"\nValerie's smile returned as she leaned her head gently on his shoulder. \"I'm glad.\"\nA few of Austin's classmates started filing into the room, greeting him one by one. Most of them offered smiles and pats on the back, congratulating him for the recognition he'd received.\nMoments later, the homeroom bell rang and the teacher stepped in, her voice calm but firm.\n\"Your academic assessments will begin in twenty-three days,\" she announced, looking over the room. \"Your physical examination will take place three days after your finals. So from today onward, doubt-clearing sessions will be given priority. Use your time after class wisely—study, train, and prepare yourselves.\"\nThe students gave a mixed reaction—most of them were nervous since their performance on the final exams would decide which section they would achieve in the third year. And some were quite hyped up since they naturally prefer challenges rather than mundane school life. For example—Rudolph and Rudolph.\nOn the other hand, Valerie seemed nervous, but for a completely different reason as she hesitantly asked her fiancé, \"Um...will we continue to study together?\"\nAustin hummed in response, \"You don't want to?\"\n\"I do!\" She hurriedly responded before her shy demeanor returned, and the girl asked, \"Umm...what about the rewards...will I continue to get them?\"\nAustin grinned, so she was curious about 'that' huh?\nSide-glancing at her with his lips stretched in a teasing smile, he asked, \"You seem quite eager about rewards?\"\nValerie's ears turned red as she stole her gaze away.\nAustin leaned toward her and asked, \"You won't get it unless you ask for it.\"\nThe redness from her ears started to spread...the girl could barely keep her composure. The images of last night were flooding in her head as she closed her eyes and uttered,\n\"I...I want...rewards ...a lot of them....\" She finally said it—apologizing to her mother and tutors for breaching the etiquette she was taught about being a maiden.\nShe is so shameless!\nAustin so wanted to squeeze her into a hug right now but considering there were people behind and in front of them, he held back his feelings for now.\nAll of a sudden, the doors of the classroom were parted a familiar man stepped inside.\nThe students instantly got up, on instinct, to greet the vice headmaster, but Harold ignored them and headed towards the teacher on the podium.\n\"Sir Harold?\" The lady asked.\nHarold, in an inaudible tone, told the teacher something before she gave a firm nod and turned toward the class\n\"Austin and Valerie, the Headmaster has summoned you.\"\nThe duo were, naturally, startled to be called out.\nAustin exchanged a look with Harold, and he could tell that the man, who usually remains calm and composed, was slightly anxious at the moment.\nThe duo didn't make the teachers wait for long and stepped out of their seats.\nRudolph was eager to ask what was the matter but the person in question was the most feared Professor on the campus. So he refrained.\nFollowing Harold Austin and Valerie stepped out of the classroom.\nThey were heading toward the Headmaster's office and before Austin could have asked 'What's the matter,' the Vice-Headmaster himself reported,\n\"Two Council Officers had come to meet you....it seems it's a national emergency.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Let them flirt in peace...haah~such a cruel world.",

      "content": "Valerie and Austin were naturally nervous, not because they were meeting the members of the organization that holds the most authority on this planet. Rather, their source of nervousness was the news they had brought.\nFollowing the vice headmaster, they entered the office room of the Headmaster where the two men in three-piece suits were waiting for them.\nOne was young, almost in his twenties which was quite a surprise. The other one seemed somewhat mature—with a white mustache and white aging hair.\nThey both turned towards the duo and Philius got up from his seat to greet them, \"Have a seat.\"\nAs they gestured, Austin and Valerie took the seat across from the two Council officers.\nHarold remained standing behind Philius.\n\"I believe I only asked you to bring student Valerie to the office, sir Harold?\" The older one asked with his gaze narrowed at Austin.\n\"She might need Austin's help to make the decision here.\" Harold plainly responded.\n\"What decision?\" Valerie asked, not liking the way the Council's officer was starting at Austin.\nThe younger officer, a bit nervously, began, \"Hey, I am Nathan and this person is my senior, Mathew. We are here to share a prophecy seen by the foreseer sheltered by the Ademerg country.\" His tone was polite and slightly hurried as if he was trying to suppress any kind of discord that may arise between Valerie and Mathew.\nHearing that nation's name, Austin frowned...what happened in the northern country all of a sudden was that the Council had to interfere.\nIf it had been some political conflict, the Council wouldn't have batted an eye at the situation, just like how they did when Drenovar was about to attack Eryndor.\nThen this meant...\"A demon attack?\" Austin wondered aloud, which took everyone by surprise.\nHowever, rather than asking how he guessed it, Nathan nodded, \"Yes, you are right. The foreseer informed the Princess that a demon, strong enough to eradicate hundreds of humans, is about to arrive in fifteen days, counting from today.\"\nJust as Austin believed, this matter involved the other side.\n'Hundreds of humans, huh...a General-ranked demon?' Austin inwardly muttered.\nAustin's knowledge about the Orc Lord and the Elven King was complete since Rhea actually fought them in the game.\nAnd since this time around the Parasite Chief wouldn't be Valerie, he couldn't tell what he could expect from the original Parasite Chief.\nHe has no idea how Valerie even defeated the Parasite Chief in the original timeline. It was just told to the readers after Valerie appears in her demonic state before Rhea.\n\"Then...why does this concern me?\" Valerie asked.\n\"It was you whom she saw in her vision...the warrior with purple hair and a spear who defeats the threat,\" Mathew spoke out bluntly without going around.\nHe crossed his arms and said, \"That's why, we want you to leave for the North right away-\"\n\"Can you stop it?\" Austin suddenly spoke, his brows knitted in a frown, as he added, \"She doesn't work under you nor you are the King of this nation to order her around. So know your place.\"\nMathew's eyes widened in shock and anger. Nathan was rooted at his place, his body stiff.\nHarold might have smirked at that 'advice' but he controlled his emotions for the sake of his job.\n\"You--!\" Mathew slammed his arm on the sofa, breaking the handrest as his aura flared.\nAustin didn't even flinch and pushed back with his own aura, which was not even a bit less fierce than the officer's...and that took everyone in the room, except for Valerie, by surprise.\nSoon Philius stood up from his seat and said, \"Gentlemen, this isn't the time to engage in personal conflict. A nation is in danger and we need to be cooperative to handle the situation.\"\nBoth men kept their unwavering gaze on each other, their Soul energy making it difficult to breathe in the room.\nAustin heaved a sigh, pulled back his aura first, and turned toward the headmaster, \"Sir, regardless of what the foreseer has seen, I can't let Valerie go to the battlefield alone.\"\nWith his gaze narrowing he added, \"Considering how there are even moles even in the Council, it wouldn't be surprising that Valerie might end up facing an army of demons there.\"\nMathew was startled and so was Philius.\nThe Council has kept the news of the mole a top-secret—both because of their reputation and people's belief in them.\nThen...how...Austin found out about it?\n\"Headmaster,\" Valerie called out, \"I might be strong, but pushing me before a foe that can destroy a nation...\" Glancing at Mathew she added, \"Is this an attempt to get rid of me instead?\"\nMathew's breath was caught in his throat as he clenched his fist and glared at the girl.\nNathan explained, \"You would be provided with the army of Ademerg. There would be Council Officers and four of the S-rank warriors with you. You don't have to actually be on the frontlines, but it's just that the foreseer has never predicted a wrong future, so the Council wants the prophecized person to be there.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh and leaned back.\nIt was slightly strange that the Council was trusting a prophecy...but considering the recent demon attacks, they might not want to take the chance.\nEveryone knows the value of Ademerg, so allowing a Demon to destroy would not only be a loss of humanity's assets but would also instill fear in others' minds that the demons could breach the borders any time they want and destroy their home.\nValerie glanced at Austin and he knew what she was asking.\nWhat would be their response?\nAustin thought for a moment before telling them, \"Can we get some time to discuss this?\"\n\"Why do you have to get involved? You are not even requi-\" Mathew's voice halted as he felt ice creeping up his feet and his body turning cold.\nThe person stiffened and so did others as he turned towards Valerie.\nWith her eyes glowing and demeanor oozing with blood lust, she said, \"Insult him again, and this will be the last discussion you will ever attend.\"\nMathew parted his mouth to say something, but this time, Nathan pushed his shoulder and glared at him, \"She'll fucking kill you, senior. Think about your family and shut up.\" Mathew, this time, closed his mouth with the attention of not speaking again.\nPhilius heaved a weary sigh and said, \"You two can go and think about it. Let me know your decision by the evening.\"\nAustin nodded and held Valerie's hand before getting up.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "After leaving the Headmaster's office, Valerie and Austin decided not to return to the class but rather head towards his office to discuss the matter.\nAustin still has no idea which General would be attacking the human realm this time, however, considering the scale of destruction the foreseer has mentioned, it must be one of the four Generals.\nThere was a thin chance for the Orc Lord to strike again this soon since his awakening was not completely last time and forcing himself to take the charge again—this time with proper planning—would only cause him his downfall.\nAustin, never even once, thought about the Elven King. He will only arise from his grave when Astaroth wakes up. So there was still some time left.\nSuccubus Queen is strong but not enough to take down a whole nation...unless she charms a few Kings and Generals here and there and forces them to kill each other.\nBut it was a highly unlikely scenario.\nSo the one who is left, and someone who appears around this time in the story is the Parasite Chief.\nIt was never mentioned how Valerie defeated it, but since she went to the other side to annihilate the General, she must have taken him by surprise.\n'But the Prophecy...it didn't shift from the previous timeline?' The prophecy stated that a warrior with long violet hair, who possesses a Tool of Destruction would be the end of the incoming disaster.\nOriginally, Valerie became the death of the Parasite King, but things are different in this timeline...yet the prophecy remains the same.\n\"Are you worried?\" Valerie suddenly asked, seeing the serious expression on him.\nAustin nodded, \"Dragging you into this, out of the blue...something feels off about it.\"\nValerie also felt that the Council depending on her, when they have seven S-ranks in possession was...confusing and slightly suspicious.\nHowever, \"We need to be there to ensure that the monstrosity is dealt with there and then,\" Holding Austin's hand, she added, \"Otherwise, the next nation it would attack would be Eryndor.\"\nAdemerg was the neighboring country of Eryndor.\nThe country by the mountain comes to the North of Eryndor and Hener was in the North-eastern region of Eryndor. So there was a high chance for the demonic army to proceed toward Eryndor if they ended up swallowing Ademerg.\n\"Thinking about world safety...is slightly easier than tackling history, I guess?\" Austin joked, trying to uplift the mood.\nValerie giggled at the comment, as they headed towards the boy's dormitory—when suddenly,\n\"Austin!\" An urgent voice arrived from behind, urging the duo to halt in their path and turn towards the source of the voice.\nRudolph and Rhea rushed towards them as the black-haired male asked, \"What happened? I heard the Council members are here?\"\nAustin was surprised, \"How did you even find out?\"\nRudolph smirked, \"I got my resources. Anyway, what did they talk about? Is something the matter?\"\nAustin hesitated in revealing, glancing at Valerie.\nThe violette gave a slight shake of her head as if to say 'Let's not tell them,' so Austin said,\n\"I believe you two should stay away from this-\"\n\"Lost trust in me or you believe I ain't worthy?\" Rudolph's quick retort took Austin by surprise.\nRhea added, \"We know that it's an emergency. That's why those officers are here. I know that we might not be helpful, but we are worried about you two.\"\nAustin was rendered speechless for a moment...he felt helpless in the situation. That's why Valerie took charge, \"Come with us but keep the information only to yourself. Rudolph, you can't even contact your father about it.\"\nThe taller boy's brows drew closer but he gave a firm nod.\nThe four of them headed towards the boy's dormitory—the two females took the safer route to escape the warden by jumping into Austin's room first.\nInside the office, Sebastian was already present, resting four cups of hot coffee on the table.\n\"I suppose you already know?\" Austin asked.\n\"I know that the Council officer said something to offend both you and the lady here.\" Sebastian couldn't hear what they discussed, thanks to the Headmaster's strict protection at his door, but the aura he felt from the room clearly said that they had a heated conversation.\nAustin exhaled a weary sigh, \"Let's not talk about it. Every person working for the Council assumes themselves to be the King of this world.\"\nNow Rhea was curious to know what happened, but considering they seemed annoyed about remembering the conversation, she didn't push them.\nOnce everyone was seated except for Sebastian, Austin revealed what they got to know, \"The Kingdom in the North, Ademerg, is about to get attacked, and the foreseer has prophecized that Valerie would be their savior.\"\nThe three of them didn't have a good reaction, as Rudolph instantly asked, \"Out of all the S-ranks, why was Valerie picked?\"\nAustin sighed, \"That's what I was thinking about.\"\nA tense silence descended upon the room, every one running their heads in different directions before Sebastian suggested,\n\"Young master, my knowledge about foreseers tells that the outcome they are is of that scenario where the foreseer doesn't see the future.\"\nAustin frowned once he realized what he was saying. But Rhea wasn't as intelligent as him so she asked, \"What do you mean?\"\nSebastian explained, \"The future tellers see that timeline in which they didn't see the future and everything happened naturally. So if we consider that, then possibly all the S-ranks, soldiers, officers would get slaughtered before the demonic army would head towards Eryndor...and once that happens, Lady Valerie would be left with no other option than to take the charge.\"\nA horrified expression marred Rhea's face....annihilation of all the S-rank warriors? Even the thought of it made her feel hopeless.\nThey are the pillars of humanity who give them the assurance that regardless of who crosses the Sea, they will shoot it down before it can reach the general masses.\nAnd to think, a being would arrive that could slaughter each of those Pillars?\nThe tension in the air was rising. No one could say with utmost certainty what the foreseer meant by their prophecy.\nNo one could tell what kind of being was preparing to injure the human race.\nJust when Austin started to fall into the pit of 'What ifs', a familiar voice broke his daze,\n\"I can help you.\"\nEvery eye turned towards the lady with short violet hair who sat on Austin's chair while sipping the coffee that was originally served to Austin.\n\"Selner.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "What decision should they take?\nShould they stay back and wait for the news, there is a high chance Sebastian's words might turn out to be true, and they will lose everything before Valerie gets forced to take charge on the battlefield.\nHowever, if that happens, then humanity would lose several of its important warriors, and that would further damage their defenses when the Demon Lord would arise.\nAustin knows that he would get stronger but it would be impossible to limit Astaroth within the other realm. So this domain still needs their eight S-rank warriors who could protect the general masses when it would matter the most.\nSo what could be the way?\n\"She has to go there.\" Selner gave the answer—direct and concrete.\n\"Why do you say so?\" Austin asked, his demeanor clearly signifying that he was reluctant.\nSelner told them, \"I have gathered information and it seems they have prepared a massive army.\" Rhea gasped at that information, but it didn't stop Selner from adding, \"The Parasite Chief is going for an all-out war.\"\nThere was a question that arose in Rudolph's mind—how did she gather such information while being on this side? However, this wasn't the time to doubt their resources.\n\"How large is that army?\" Austin asked, his voice clearly containing the weight of the matter.\nSelner leaned back in the seat, and calmly told them, \"Around five thousand demons.\"\nThe room fell under a grave silence.\nEven Sebastian showed a reaction that clearly expressed his shock and fret.\nFor context, about one thousand demons attacked the tournament venue, and more than a hundred students died, and the whole place was wrecked.\nAnd here....five thousand demons...\n\"Have you informed the Council?\" Austin asked, somehow still sounding calm even though inwardly, he was also quite shaken.\nSelner heaved a sigh, \"You think they would have let me roam freely if I had revealed such information?\"\nRevealing something so clearly about the demon realm would instantly make them wary of Selner. After all, just like Rudolph, they would also think, 'How did she get such clear information?'.\nThat's why, \"I will let them know what they could expect through some indirect source.\"\nTurning her narrowed gaze towards Rhea and Rudolph she said, \"But if someone gets to know that it was me who shared the news, I will find you two.\"\nA chill ran down their spines as they stiffened and instantly nodded.\nValerie soon asked, \"....those numbers cannot be tackled by just Ademerg's army. All the S-ranks would need to engage.\"\nGenerally, just like this time, regardless of the situation, the Council always keeps a few high-ranking soldiers within the Headquarters since they prioritize their safety.\nHowever, if Selner was telling the truth, then keeping the three S-ranks as reserve or backup would be a bad decision.\n\"A war on this scale...I am not sure if the Council could prepare for it in the time they have left.\" Sebastian voiced.\nFrom what he heard from his young master, it appeared they only had fifteen or so days before the demonic army would cross the Sea of Separation.\n\"Will they strike all at once?\" Austin asked, a bit hopeful.\nIf that was the case then he surely could utilize Scar to launch another of that black orb attack and cease the lives of hundreds at once.\nIf he could decimate a huge number at the beginning, not only would it throw the enemy side into dismay, but it also would boost the confidence on their side.\nAnd even though the Parasite Chief is a calamity-class monster, he was originally slaughtered by Valerie. So, with the help of several S-ranks, the job would be done more easily.\nHowever, \"I doubt he would deploy all the soldiers at once. The Parasite Chief is a military commander. He might be a demon but he isn't the mindless worms you have faced until now. He will split his army to force us to send our strong warriors in different directions.\"\nHer words only elevated their worries. If that happens then the S-ranks would be forced to handle different stations. And that would spread the forces.\n'They have the numbers but we don't...' If Austin remembers correctly, Ademerg only had three thousand soldiers in possession. And the Council doesn't possess the numbers but rather the quality.\nHowever, opposing forces would have demonic beasts that could slaughter hundreds at once.\nSo there is a high chance for the demon side to have the upper hand.\n\"The war hasn't even started yet I feel hopeless,\" Rudolph muttered aloud, expressing his honest thoughts.\nIt wasn't like he was being pessimistic; rather, it was more like he had given the conclusion after deep contemplation.\n\"So are you going to just sit there and feel hopeless?\" Selner asked, her eyes focused on Austin.\nEveryone turned toward the blond Prince as he said, \"Losing hope and just waiting for them to destroy my home never crossed my mind.\" Austin spoke in a matter-of-fact tone.\nSelner hummed, interested in what he would say.\nAustin turned towards Selner and said, \"You need to inform the Council and get me in contact with this mage named Charlotte.\"\nSelner's brows elevated, \"That...barrier user...what do you have in mind?\"\nAustin started to speak about what he thought to force the enemy to lead in the same way Austin wanted them to.\nEveryone listened intently, without having a single thought of speaking in between.\n\"...and that's what I think would be enough to lure them where we want them to be.\"\nSelner hummed, \"I am impressed. If this really works, we will be able to erase a huge amount of their forces in no time.\"\nAustin nodded as he got up, \"Then we should start preparing for the war?\"\nRudolph and Rhea got up instantly, all charged up for the war.\nBut then suddenly, Selner appeared behind Valerie, startling everyone, and rested her hand on Valerie's shoulder.\n\"What...?\" Valerie tried to turn towards Selner but the grip was too strong to allow her to move.\n\"I will take her and prepare her for the war.\"\nAustin panicked, \"B-But there are only fifteen days left. Don't take her....\"\n\"You know time stops being a concern when I'm involved. And we both know—she's still nowhere near her full potential.\"\nAustin parted his lips, wanting to argue but he couldn't say anything.\nJust as she said, Valerie is not as strong as her canon counterpart. That's why Valerie needs some training before the war.\nIt was because she never became heartbroken and was forced to walk on a path where she could have embraced death at any moment.\nValerie also understood the necessity of the training that's why she approached Austin.\nCupping his cheek, she softly said, \"It's just about a few days...\"\n\"I know...but still....\" They hadn't been away from each other for more than a day...so this sudden separation made them anxious.\nHowever, to prepare for the future they have to sacrifice their present.\nIn the end, he just drew closer to her and after cupping her cheeks, he rested his head against hers before whispering, \"Take care. I will be waiting for you.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

And also how comfortable Austin appeared around her.\nHowever, it was a fact that she was someone who had helped Austin at the time when he was all alone—fighting the gravest battle of his life.\nShe helped him in both timelines, allowing him to send his soul fragments into different worlds so he could prepare for the war better.\nNot to talk about, recently, when she brought Austin to the other side, she was ready to sacrifice her powers and status as a Witch if the Demoness tried to harm Austin.\nValerie might be a jealous fool who doesn't like even those women who ogle at her beloved. However, Selner was an exception. She could tolerate him.\n\"Quite deep in thought you are,\" Selner spoke as she led Valerie through some passage that was barely lit.\nValerie could tell that she wasn't inside the Council Headquarters but somewhere else.\n\"I am thinking about you. It's quite suspicious that you are doing all this just to bring peace to this world.\"\nSelner chuckled, genuine laughter from the woman, as she asked, \"And from how much I know you, you must have thought my interest in helping you...is related to Austin?\"\n\"Is it not?\" Valerie questioned back.\nSelner glanced at the girl. Even though they could barely see each other, Selner knew that Valerie was giving her that narrowed-eye stare down.\n\"I don't know what you think of me, Valerie, but I would have only gone for Austin if I had seen even the slightest of affection in his eyes for me.\"\nValerie's heart skipped a beat, \"You didn't see any?\"\nSelner grinned, \"If I had, nothing could have stopped me from getting him for myself.\"\nValerie glared at her.\nHowever, she soon had to squint her eyes as they suddenly entered a space that was brightly illuminated.\nIt was a room, about the size of a library with a high ceiling. The floor was not made of wood or marble...it was a slightly soft material, which could cushion someone's fall.\nValerie looked to the left and found....weapons. Like every kind of weapon was hanging by the wall. Axe, mace, swords of several kinds, daggers, bows, and arrows...she didn't even know half of the weapon names.\n\"This is your home for the next two months.\"\nValerie's eyes widened as she snatched her eyes away from the weapons and looked at the woman, \"Two months?! The demonic army would arrive in fifteen days.\" The cause of her panic wasn't the demons at all. Just the thought of not being able to meet Austin for two months caused her minor heart attack.\nSelner rested her hand on her waist as she scoffed, \"You think I could train you within a few days? This is a time chamber prepared just to train you.\"\nValerie's expression turned grim as she started to back off, heading towards the passage from where she came—but,\n\"Huh?!\" She collided against a wall.\nShe hurriedly turned toward her back....and gone. The exit was gone!\n\"This is my domain, Princess. I can use my magic freely here.\" Selner said as she levitated in the air with a smile of amusement never leaving her face.\nDrawing closer to Valerie, she said, \"You know what's the trick to leaving the place?\" Leaning to her ear, she whispered, \"You just need to land a hit on m-\"\n*SHLINK*\nSelner had to tilt her body as the spearhead came towards her neck.\nValerie didn't wait. She twisted her grip and slammed her foot down, lunging with a sharp thrust. The spear shot straight for Selner's chest.\nSelner leaned back. Just an inch. The spearhead grazed her coat.\nValerie growled and spun, slashing sideways.\nSelner ducked, then weaved past the follow-up jab like wind slipping through cracks.\nA flurry of stabs followed—fast, sharp, deadly.\nSelner's feet barely touched the ground as she stepped aside, turned, and leaned back. Every strike missed by a breath.\nValerie's eyes burned. She jumped, feinted high, then swept low.\nSelner skipped back. Her heel tapped the wall, but she didn't stop. She twirled past the final strike, hair whipping.\nStill untouched.\nSelner grinned.\n\"Almost.\"\n\"You can't keep me away from him!\" Valerie growled.\nSelner grinned, \"Then earn your freedom.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nAustin was....feeling listless.\nHe has so many things to think about, however, with the absence of his advisor and lover beside him, he was feeling helpless.\n\"Get yourself together, young master. This is for the greater good.\"\nAustin sighed upon hearing Sebastian's words as he slid the letter into an envelope and sealed it.\n\"Send it through WarpMail.\" Austin handed the letter to Sebastian.\nIt was written to his father, letting him know everything that is happening since Austin believes that the Council surely hasn't contacted them yet.\nAustin would visit his home in four days since the capital comes the route to Ademerg.\nHowever, since the preparation needs to be done as soon as possible, Austin decided to convey the message through the WarpMail.\n\"What are you going to do now, sir?\" Sebastian asked as he took the letter.\nAustin didn't have to think to inform him, \"For the next four days, I am going to just train, Sebas. I need to prepare myself as well.\"\nHe has already bought the next dungeon and Austin would be pushing himself to reach A-rank in these four days, anyhow.\nWhen he asked the system, 'What are the percentages of reaching A-rank in four sessions' the answer was,\n[1%]\nThe system only allows Austin to remain within the dungeon for four hours a day, before forcibly throwing him out.\nInitially, it was six hours, but with growing difficulty, the system took this decision.\nSo, like sixteen hours, he has to finish the two dungeons and break into rank A.\nYes, it sounded almost impossible. However, Austin won't know until he tries it.\n'Valerie is working hard there, so I should also give my two hundred percent....'\nThe war was on the horizon and both sides have started their preparations.\n°°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Poor Valerie. The fact is, Selner can split her body and send one clone outside. So....eheh~",

      "content": "Austin stood in the resting zone, taking steady breaths to calm his pounding heart. Raijin rested in his grip, humming with tension.\nHe was in the fourth dungeon.\nThe shore stretched before him, waves crashing not far from where he stood. This dungeon was close to the ocean—and it showed.\nDozens of crocodile-like humanoid beasts walked across the muddy field ahead. Their limbs were long and webbed, backs lined with translucent fins. Their glowing eyes swept the area, and their skin rippled, shifting colors to match the terrain.\nTough. Fast. Slippery. A nightmare on unstable ground.\nAustin has just demiated more than a hundred fish like flying creatures, who didn't give him many points. But these were of different species.\nEach one was a solid B- rank—just a step below Austin. One or two wouldn't be a problem. But fifty? In open ground where they could slide and swarm?\nIt'd be suicide.\nBut then his eyes caught the glowing numbers above their heads—[200].\nA slow, wild grin tugged at his lips. \"Now we're talkin'…\"\nHe dismissed Raijin, summoning God's Wrath—twin hammers of punishment flashing into his hands.\nThe countdown began.\n[...4...3...2...1…]\n[BZZZZZZZ-]\nRed light flooded the resting zone. The monsters snapped to attention, muscles tensing, eyes locking on him.\nToo slow.\nAustin's right arm blurred.\nTHWAAAANGGG\nOne hammer slammed down against the other in mid-air. The impact triggered a violent shockwave, blasting a curtain of mud into the monsters' faces. It bought him a second. That's all he needed.\nHe shot into the air, hand gripping a small, hexagonal device that pulsed with eerie light. His eyes scanned the chaos—seven of them clustered together.\nPerfect.\nHe threw.\nCLICK.\nThe device latched onto a monster's arm. It blinked in confusion, not knowing its death had already begun.\nDOOOOOM.\nA black orb exploded from the gadget, swallowing the seven creatures in a swirling gravitational field. They were dragged together, mashed into one mass, limbs flailing and thrashing in panic. The orb held tight—its core hidden somewhere in the tangle.\nAustin levitated, Raijin flickering back into his hand. Thunder crackled around him like a storm taking human shape.\n\"Let's roast you nice and easy,\" he said, lightning licking across his skin.\nThe remaining monsters stepped back, their instincts screaming danger. Those trapped inside the orb froze when they saw him. They couldn't even make out his full figure—just a man-shaped storm, wrapped in silver lightning, grinning like a demon set loose.\n\"Alright then,\" Austin muttered, spinning the axe over his head.\nA halo of lightning formed, glowing above him before sliding down in a perfect ring. It struck the ground around the cluster of monsters like a cage.\nThe beasts inside panicked. They twisted and clawed, desperate to break free.\nToo late.\nThe moment they touched the ring—ZAP.\nTheir bodies jerked. Muscles locked. Skin sparked.\nAustin watched them squirm for a moment… then snapped his fingers.\nSilence.\nThe halo shrank.\n\"KHEEEK!!\"\n\"HIIIIIICKK!!\"\nThey shrieked as lightning surged through them, frying their nerves and burning them from the inside out. Smoke curled from their mouths.\nOne lone croc lunged at Austin from the side.\nHe didn't flinch.\nHe slid out his dagger—Shard—and calmly extended it toward the creature.\nHis eyes gleamed cold.\n\"Wait for your turn.\"\nThe screams died out.\nOnly the crackle of fading electricity remained, buzzing in the air like a warning.\nSmoke rose from the ring, black and foul. The once vicious monsters now lay tangled and twitching, their skin charred, fins melted, and eyes wide open in lifeless shock. The mud beneath them sizzled, a few small sparks still dancing across the scorched earth.\nThe muddy land turned silent; the seven monsters now turned into a mangled, charred matter that was neither living nor identifiable.\nAustin took a deep breath and looked at the remaining creatures.\nThey had already made the distance from each other, hissing and radiating bloodlust, which was thicker than the smell of molten flesh and bones.\n'Good...they won't come at me at once now...' Austin summoned the twin hammers and took his position.\nThere were still three hours left—he would surely reach the mid-boss by then.\n°°°°°°°°°°\n\"Are you really going?\" Rudolph asked the pink head beside him as they rested in the gymnasium\nIt was already evening and no one could be found in here.\nThey came here after classes for a casual spar since their heads were restless and fighting can only help them collect their thoughts.\n\"Of course. Why do you ask?\" Rhea stated in a matter-of-fact tone.\nRudolph sighed, \"Look...Rhea ..this is not a battle but a war. A war in which we can lose our lives.\"\nRhea's brows elevated, \"Do you think I don't know?\"\nRudolph couldn't say what he actually wanted to, so he just turned silent.\nHowever, Rhea had started to understand him enough to realize what he intended to say here.\n\"You don't want me to go there because you think my participation won't change much.\" The pinkhead voiced without any contempt or displeasure in her voice.\nRudolph shook his head, \"I won't say that your participation wouldn't matter ...you still are the fifth strongest warrior of the academy.\"\nAlthough Rudolph said that he knew if things came down Rhea would be forced to join the military.\nIf Eryndor gets attacked and things seem to be heading south, the King would order even the students of the academy to charge toward the frontline. Rudolph knows since it has happened in the past too.\nSo hoping to keep Rhea away from the battlefield seems like a pipe dream.\nRhea chuckled. Hugging her knees she said, \"There are countless sad parts of being an orphan. But you know what's the single merit for not having a family?\" She glanced at him, a sad smile tugging at her lips.\nRudolph remained silent, allowing her to add, \"No one will cry even if I die tomorrow.\"\nThat's the reason why Rhea used to be so reckless before joining the academy. Working as a hunter, going to places where a normal girl wouldn't even dare to look at...she has lived that life since she knew there was no one to cry for her even if the person named Rhea disappeared one day.\nSuddenly, Rhea felt warmth on her cheek before her face was turned towards Rudolph, and her lips were covered by another pair.\n\"....!\" Rhea's eyes widened, her mind failing to register what she was experiencing, but in a corner of her mind, she could tell what was happening.\nShe was being kissed!\nThat sweet interaction only remained for a few seconds before Rudolph made some distance and softly whispered,\n\"Now you know that someone will cry if you disappear.\"\n\"⁄•⁄-⁄•⁄\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Cedric was sitting at the dining table with his wife as they were having dinner and a peaceful chat.\nJust as Austin thought the Council didn't even bother telling them about what the foreseer saw and the possible attack on Eryndor.\n\"You will be coming to his graduation ceremony, right?\" Cedric asked Sophie as he sliced the steak into small cubes for her.\nSophie seemed hesitant, \"...I don't want to spoil his special day.\"\nCedric heaved a sigh...if she continued to think like that, their relationship would never heal. Unless she appears before Austin often, they would never start talking again and things would only get worse as time goes by.\nAfter a brief moment of pause, he said, \"Be selfish then. You want to see your son graduating from the academy, right? So just be selfish and come with me.\"\nA soft breath escaped her lips as she shook her head slightly. There was still a year left so she couldn't tell how things would be then.\nSo rather than rejecting her husband's request, she chose to remain silent.\nJust as Cedric handed the plate of perfectly diced steak to his wife, a third person entered the dining hall, urging the duo to turn towards the person.\n\"A-Avy...\"\n\"...huh?\"\nBoth of them were shocked, and it was a natural reaction upon seeing their daughter—who refused to step out of her room for years—suddenly appear in the dinning hall.\nShe was wearing her usual night gown and a blank expression on her face.\nAveris wordlessly took the seat on the right of the King and said, \"I want to talk to you two.\"\nCedric calmed himself down and said, \"Yes, please tell us.\" He was already quite content with the fact that she broke out of her isolation and approached them.\n\"Tell us, Averis. We will help you in any way possible.\" Sophie assured her, barely containing her elation.\nThe silver-haired teenager looked down, her hands resting on her lap, and a brief moment of hesitation appeared in her eyes. However, she has already thought about it carefully.\n\"I want a few tutors...who can help me prepare for the academy.\" Looking at her father, she said, \"I want to join the Valorian Academy.\"\nCedric was taken aback by that request.\nHe turned toward his wife and found her to be as baffled as him.\n\"Averis...you want to be with your brother, huh?\" Cedric asked; remembering that it was Austin who suggested her joining the academy.\nAt that time, Cedric hardly believed that Averis would get over her depression and return to the world so soon.\nHowever, he was wrong.\n\"D-Don't just assume anything you want. I am not doing this because I want to be with him!\" Averis's face turned red, the panic in her voice making her appear amusing, but neither the King nor Queen dared to laugh.\nCrossing her thin arms on her chest she said, \"I just don't want to stare at those walls anymore! I will join the Academy and show him his place by getting a better position than him. That's all.\"\n\"But it still means that you are going there for your brother, no?\" Cedric teased, couldn't suppress the grin anymore.\nSophie squeezed her husband's hand, shaking her head at him as if to say 'Don't say that or she will change her mind'.\nHowever, Averis didn't say anything about that and after getting up she said, \"Assume whatever you want...I just want a few capable instructors who can help me get prepared for the assessment.\" Saying so, she walked away.\nCedric finally laughed out loud; both happy and amused how his daughter was trying hard to appear tough and uncaring about her brother.\nA beautiful smile adorned the Queen's lips as she said, \"They might have been separated for years, they still share a strong bond.\" She couldn't express how happy she was to see that they have forgiven each other and have patched things up.\nCedric held his wife's hand gently and assured her, \"Things will improve between you and our son too. Just give him some time.\"\nSophie lowered her head and didn't say anything. Well, all she and her husband could do at the moment is to hope.\n\"Sir,\" Suddenly, Robert called out and stepped toward the table.\nFor him to disturb him during his dinner meant the matter was serious.\nThe blond man turned towards his loyal butler and took the letter from him.\nUsing the knife, he parted the seal from the envelope before taking out the letter.\nHe read the content of the letter and his frown continued to grow deep.\nSophie grew tense and so did Robert.\nAfter a minute, he finally took his eyes away from the letter before he heard his wife asking, \"Who sent it?\"\n\"Austin...he sent a warning.\" Handing the letter to Robert he said, \"Gather the ministers.\"\n\"Now, sir?\" It was already past sunset so it was unnatural for a meeting to be held at this time.\nCedric told him, \"Once you read the letter you would know.\"\nRobert didn't delay any longer and walked away while reading the letter ...and as he continued to read further his steps began hurried—he almost started running.\nThe demonic army was approaching.\nEryndor was a potential target.\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nSebastian was currently massaging his young master's stiff muscles.\nHe was in Austin's room, sitting on a chair while applying a pain relieving balm to his stiff calf.\nHe was already asleep when Sebastian arrived here.\nSebastian has no idea where his young master goes to train since he never leaves his room...but he could tell that he was growing. His presence, day after day, has started to take the shape of a seasoned warrior.\nDay by day he was losing his teenage innocence and was embracing a warrior's creed.\nPractically speaking, it was for the best that Austin was transforming into someone who can protect himself and the ones he adores.\n....but as someone who has been with Austin since he was just a child, Sebastian feels that this cruel world has burdened his young master with countless responsibilities.\nAnd the fact is...there was no return from this. Even if they win this war...nothing would remain the same.\nSebastian has a feeling that a wave was approaching.\nA wave which would change everything. Many people who were close to his young master might leave his side....even Sebastian himself.\n'I just hope...you are prepared to face what is to come, young master.'\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

Even if he runs at full speed it would take two and a half days.\nThat's why he was going to take a hybrid form of transportation.\nHe would travel to the capital on carriage, to save energy. He will stay there for half a day and will attend the meeting there before leaving by midnight on his feet.\nOnce he reached his limit, he would rent a horse and continue his way towards Ademerg.\n'Once I reach the Capital...I will take another trip to the dungeon. And while traveling on a horse would allow me to-'\n[The system advises the Host to refrain from going inside the dungeon for a few days. Please, host.]\nAustin frowned...why was the system advising him all of a sudden?\nHe understands that the system was concerned that he might be pushing himself a little here, but Austin wants to be prepared for the worst.\nHe hasn't even reached the final boss of the fourth dungeon and he has already used the four hours of today.\nHe was so damn frustrated with himself right now that if he could prepare a clone of himself, that pitiful clone would have been slaughtered again and again.\n'I can't go on like this. I have to use my points to buy new gadgets and weapons and somehow breakthrough...without my soul fragment, I won't be able to protect Val.'\nHe was now hurriedly putting his clothes in the bag—completely unaware that a certain violet-haired woman had appeared behind him and watching him for some time now.\n\"You are sick.\"\nAustin flinched and instantly turned around, \"Selner...wait...you are here means-\" his eyes widened but before he could fall into the ditch of panic, she cleared the misunderstanding,\n\"This is just my clone. The real me is still with Valerie.\"\nAustin heaved a long sigh and fell on the bed, \"You scared me.\" Taking a pause to calm down his heart he asked, \"How is Valarie doing?\" It has been three days but it already feels like they have been separated for months.\nSelner had a grim expression on her face as she sat down across from him and asked, \"She is fine but have you looked at yourself lately?\"\nThe last time Selner saw him, he was nothing like his present self.\nThe current Austin...looked pitiful.\nSunken eyes. Pale skin. Disheveled clothes and trembling limbs.\nIt was the sign of someone who has been neglecting rest and engaging in battles constantly.\nShe has seen those militants who remain on the border in the same condition as him. But they were forced to live that life. The same cannot be said about Austin.\n\"Ah, yeah. I have been working a little extra these days. Sebastian was complaining earlier as well.\"\n\"You call that a little extra?!\" Selner's displeased voice startled Austin as he looked up.\nSelner didn't hide her displeasure as she said, \"In an attempt to become better and stronger, you are losing yourself, Austin. You are trying to reach a position that takes years of hard work and dedication. And whenever someone has tried to apply brute force in order to shorten the distance...I assure you, each one of them had broken into millions of pieces. And you...you are also heading in that direction.\"\n[....+1]\nAustin didn't see the system's message at all since he was incredibly shocked at the moment.\nHe has never seen Selner this...expressive before. She has always maintained a calm and mature aura around her\nHowever, each word she spoke was laced with frustration and grief.\nThe current Austin reminds Selner of the same Austin who has gone beyond the point of any mortal's reach. Austin never pursued power, but having overwhelming strength numbed all his human emotions. And this version of Austin, who was supposed to be better than his past self in every aspect, was becoming the same lifeless husk.\nSomeone who lives only for battle.\nLeaning forward she asked with a frown, \"Can you imagine how Valerie would have reacted if she had seen you like this?\"\nAustin's breath was caught in his throat...he looked horrible right now, and if Valerie had seen his current state..., \"She will cry,\" He voiced out in a barely audible tone, terrified by just the imagination of seeing his beloved breaking down before him.\nSelner looked dead in his eyes and said, \"If you don't want me to report to her about your current state...then promise me something.\"\nAustin nodded like a child, ready to accept anything she said right now.\nSelner pointed her index finger at him and told him, \"You won't train for more than an hour a day from now on. And don't you think you can lie to me using your system?\"\nAustin was baffled, \"You know about the System?\" The first thought that came after realizing her knowledge about the system was, \"Did you create it?\".\nSelner shook her head, \"I have no knowledge about this system thing you possess. Austin, actually, fleetingly told me once about it...but he didn't use it anywhere as much as you.\"\nAustin was left speechless...his previous self must have been quite close to Selner.\nRegardless, the matter of concern wasn't the system here.\nAustin calmly told her, \"I won't push myself anymore and will only train for an hour ...but this way I won't be able to achieve my third fragment before the war, right?\"\n\"Even if you continue this way, you won't be able to attain the third fragment. Your soul won't be prepared for it.\"\nAustin was slapped with a fact that broke all his hopes.\nSelner heaved a sigh, seeing his shoulders turning lifeless, as she said, \"Why are you so eager to shoulder everything by yourself? Do you not trust your friends and your beloved?*\n\"I do....but it's just, I don't want to become a weakness for Valerie again...even if I can't protect her, I want to be there to support her.\"\nSelner was rendered speechless.\nThere...was such a drastic contrast between the two Austins.\nWhen he spoke those words, it exposed how much Austin cared about Valerie. He just wanted to be useful to her...to stand with her....to protect her if he could.\nShe has never seen two people so deeply fallen for each other that they readily agree to destroy themselves in order to protect the other.\n'Humans...are such interesting creatures...' Selner got up from her seat and told Austin,\n\"Reach Ademerg on time. I will meet you there.\"\nAustin nodded, and upon seeing her figure fading, he hurriedly extended, \"Please give this to Valerie!\"\nSelner raised her brows and took the folded parchment from Austin before hearing him say,\n\"Don't read it. Hand it to her.\"\nSelner grinned; she found a new motivation to keep that girl moving.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading the chapter. Drop a comment.",

      "content": "Selner had a smile on her face.\nEven though her arms were plastered to the wall and the whole training chamber was covered in a thick layer of ice, she was smiling.\nThe reason behind her happiness was Valerie's progression.\nEach day in the outside world means a month here. She lied to Valerie about keeping her here for only four months, while she would be staying for about a year here.\nSelner was unsure of how much Valerie had progressed with her Shard, so for the last two and a half months, all she did was polish her combat skills and magic control.\nIt was not difficult to work with Valerie since she has been taught by a teacher before and knows the value of this training. She is a diligent child who can go beyond her physical limits to fulfill the task given to her.\nHer magic control has shown such drastic improvement that the moment Selner flashed the letter before Valerie, the whole room was caged in ice.\nSelner never got to tell her that it was going to be a test if she wanted to read the letter.\n'It appears she has started reading me better...' Her intentions were anticipated, and the girl didn't waste a blink to freeze her at her place and snatch the letter away.\n\"Mind showing me what he wrote?\" Selner asked only to get ignored by the girl who was smilingly reading the letter.\nValerie was aware that she was going to be kept here longer than she was told, and at some point, she would have become frustrated because of not being able to see the one she lives for.\nHowever, this letter helped her calm down her frustrated self.\nShe went through the letter for the fourth time, and the smile couldn't seem to fade from her face at all,\n[Dear Valerie,\nThis might be the first time for me to write a letter to you...but this is the first for us to be separated like this as well. I might sound childish but three days seems like three months for me!]\n'For me too...my lord.' She wanted to tear up but her mind desired to read further. So, she did,\n[I have been working hard these days...a little too hard. After all, a war is approaching, and I need to be prepared....or so what I wanted to say, but my motivation to work hard is to impress you once you return. A strong husband for a strong wife.]\nValerie chuckled...how can he be so adorable? She wanted to see him right now...haa~\n[People say that after separating from someone, you get to understand how precious they were to you. And that is correct. In your absence, I realized I didn't pay attention to you enough...I want to love you more, Val. So please come back as fast as you can.\n—Austin.]\nValerie exhaled a long breath as she folded the paper securely, not wanting to part from it.\nShe was going to read this twice a day to keep herself motivated.\nRaising her spear, she thumped it on the ground, and all the ice from the training ground shattered.\n*CLINK*\nSelner was liberated from her ice cage as she asked, \"If it's about Austin, your magic control becomes monstrous. It explains why you were able to unlock that spell when Austin was injured.\"\n\"So you indeed were watching us,\" Valerie spoke with her eyes narrowed.\nAt that time, when the Illusion Monkey attacked, Valerie didn't see anyone around. But they were being watched.\n\"Valerie, you do realize the nature of that spell, right?\"\nValerie's brows elevated as she responded, \"Isn't it an extension of Ice magic?\" After all, that's what her Shard is capable of. She has an affinity with Ice magic, so she believed her strongest spell must be of the same attribute.\nBut, \"You are wrong...when you create the Ice Prison for your opponent, you stop the time in that cage.\"\nValerie's brows drew closer as she listened to her intently.\nSelner plucked a hairstrand before snapping her finger.\nThe thin strand was surrounded by a grey orb that floated mid-air as she explained, \"This is a time chamber where the time will work as I want. However, for someone inexperienced, they would just stop time within the orb...and so, even after a hundred or thousand of years, the hair strand would remain the same, if only the mage could maintain their spell.\"\nSnapping the orb, Selner continued, \"But your spell, Valerie...it was different. You didn't just create a time chamber...it was a null domain. A place where not only the physical and mental state of a being gets frozen, but their very soul gets trapped.\"\nValerie was trying to make a sense out of it, as she said, \"How...is that any different?\"\nSelner made it plain and simple this time, \"A null domain can achieve something which a time chamber can never,\" with her eyes turning serious, she added, \"You can break someone's soul and eradicate their existence from the world—without leaving any hope of rebirth. You...are the ultimate death of any being, Valerie.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\n\"You really want to travel with me? You could have reached Ademerg directly, Sebas.\" Austin told the butler who was walking beside him towards the entrance of the academy.\nThe sun had barely peeked from the horizon, and they were ready to leave.\nTime was a very important factor here, so Austin decided not to waste it. Especially not when he wasn't going to train rigorously anymore.\nGod...he had such a deep sleep last night.\n\"You may outrun me in a sprint now, young master, but until the last breath I will fulfill my duty as your guardian.\"\nAustin stopped there. There was no point in pursuing the man. He would do whatever he decides upon.\nAs they reached the entrance, Austin saw four familiar people standing there.\nRhea and Rudolph were expected, but the other two...\n\"Good morning, headmaster, Vice-headmaster.\"\nHarold gave a nod and Philius greeted back, \"Good morning, Austin. Are you prepared to leave?\"\nAustin nodded as he showed him his bag. It was just a pretense to have a bag. Most of his stuff were inside the inventory.\nPhilius stepped toward Austin before resting his hand on his shoulder, \"It's a brave decision...to approach the warzone. Not only you, but Valerie, Rudolph and Rhea...I commend you all for your courage.\"\nRhea faintly smiled while Rudolph maintained a serious expression.\nTurning toward the blond one, he added, \"Asking you to prioritize your safety when you are going for a war is not possible...but please, try to return alive.\"\nAustin assured the man, \"None of your students will die, I assure you, Headmaster. I take the guarantee of it.\"\nPhilius softly smiled, \"Wish you luck, son.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "'System, are you upset?' Austin asked inwardly as he and Sebastian rushed towards the capital of Eryndor.\nThey have calculated their travel time to be around half a day which would allow them to rest for some time and leave for Ademerg by midnight or the next morning.\nRhea tripped at some point so the duo was taking a break a little behind, but they assured to reach the Capital on time.\nHowever, travel time wasn't on his mind right now. Austin was more worried about his system who seemed to be angry with him.\nThe system has been responding to Austin's commands, like opening his Inventory or Shop feature. But whenever Austin asked something casually, like right now, the system remained silent.\nAnd Austin...knew the reason behind its anger.\n'You are upset because I didn't listen to your advice but Selner's, huh?'\nThere was still no response.\nAustin sighed, thinking that he might have to find a better way to pursue the system.\nBut then—a familiar system screen appeared.\n[We have been in a relationship for the past 256 days, 14 hours, 17 minutes, and 28 seconds. I have been with you in every low and high...so when I suggested you should stop...you didn't listen to me. But when that woman said the same thing....]\nAustin wasn't imagining things here.\nThe system was actually sobbing.\nHe can hear...her voice.\nNot just a static voice, but the voice of a young girl...weeping.\n\"Young master?\" Sebastian was surprised to see the younger one suddenly slowing down in his tracks, his feet stumbling as he somehow stopped in his way.\nSebastian approached him, a concern written over his face as he asked again, \"Is everything alright, sir?\"\nAustin nodded to him and said, \"Let's take a few minutes of break.\"\nSebastian was unsure why this sudden suggestion of break when the young master seemed completely fine, but since he was actually tired, he didn't say anything against the decision.\nAustin sat down on the log and asked the system, 'You...are crying? Were you so worried about me?'\n[No! This is fake tears! I am putting up an act here!]\nShe is furious now.\nAustin exhaled a long breath, 'System...what can I do to stop you from crying? Anything is fine.'\nHe couldn't forget the help the system has provided to him until now. Since the first day, she has been by his side, supporting him through thick and thin and providing him with all the support he needed to reach where he stands now.\nSo, naturally, he would be concerned about her.\n[C-Can you...stop pushing yourself from now on.]\n'I have already stopped. So please don't cry anymore.' His inner voice was extremely soft as if he was coaxing a small child who was left behind in the house while others went to the carnival.\nA brief moment of pause, before she asked again,\n[Just to be on the safe side, can I limit the dungeons to two hours for the time being?]\n'Will that make you smile? Then go ahead.'\n[Ding!]\n[Command accepted ≧⁠▽⁠≦]\nAustin chuckled...this system is really...\n\"Should we continue our journey, Sebas?\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nCedric was sitting in the conference room with all his trusted people around him—including the Prime Minister, the Commander of the Imperial Legion, the new finance minister, and the minister of public affairs.\nCurrently, the post of Chief Advisor was vacant but currently, the King was not worried about the vacant post at all.\nHis reason for concern was something entirely different and far more terrifying.\n\"An army of five thousand demons...forget about making us a secondary target, they can divide the forces and attack us right away.\" The Prime Minister, Oakdine Arthur, spoke in a tone that contained the weight of the matter\nIn the room, every face had a knitted frown; concern and anxiety couldn't be hidden.\n\"What is our current army capacity?\" Cedric asked the tallest one in the room—the Imperial Chief.\n\"After the revelation...we had to kick out more than a thousand warriors. So now we have come down to fifteen hundred warriors.\"\nThe 'revelation' he talked about was the incident that neither Eryndor nor Cedric could ever forget about.\nWhen Adrian's true face was revealed, they reached the roots of the matter and dug out every single soldier who was under the influence of the corrupted beings.\nCedric doesn't regret the past—it's safer to have a single loyal soldier than a thousand bastards.\n\"Are we supplying soldiers to Ademerg?\" The Prime Minister asked.\n\"They won't need our help. The council is already helping them.\" The Finance Minister, who was a young man in his twenties with black long hair, extended his thoughts.\n\"But leaving everything to them when the demons are so huge in numbers...\" Arthur tried to argue. But the King has already decided,\n\"We need to prioritize our people's safety. And anyway, the Council never bothered informing us about it so why should we bother offering anything to them.\"\nThe statement shook a few but they didn't raise a finger of resistance. The King has already taken his decision and he won't be receiving any advice on the matter.\nCedric was about to extend further orders when suddenly,\n\"My lord.\" Robert appeared behind Cedric, his tone holding slight panic, \"The ruler of Drenovar is here.\"\nCedric's eyes widened slightly as he instinctively muttered, \"God...he didn't change his mind, did he?\" Eryndor was in no position to face a war against Drenovar right now when they were already under the threat of demonic forces.\nCedric got up from his seat, and following them others also got up.\nNo one followed the Supreme authority except for his butler.\nThe King made his way towards the reception area with hurried strides.\nHe was not expecting the King himself to arrive here to declare a war or something. And if he was not here with the intention of war, then maybe...\n\"Quite unexpected to see you here, Idris.\" The familiar black-haired ruler turned towards Cedric, a stiff smile on his face. He tried to appear friendly but couldn't hide the tension.\n\"Cedric...how have you been?\" The man ignored the handshake and went for a brief hug.\nRobert tensed, his fingers inches away from his dagger, seeing the two of them being so close.\nBut Idris only intended to greet him as a friend.\nOnce they both separated, Cedric gestured for the man to sit down.\nOnce seated, Idris voiced, \"I heard about the situation and left Drenovar as soon as I could.\"\nCedric's brows tensed, \"Despite knowing the situation, you are risking your life by being here?\" Eryndor was a potential target of the demonic army. That's why, Cedric didn't want the ruler of a different land to be here.\nHowever, \"If I hadn't come who would have commanded my army?\"\nCedric blinked in surprise, \"Army?\"\nIdris nodded, \"More than two thousand soldiers marched behind me to Eryndor. They would be at the northern border by dusk.\"\nCedric was rendered speechless...Idris actually wasn't here to wage a war, rather, it was the opposite.\nHe was here to extend a helping hand.\nResting his hand on Cedric's shoulder, Idris said, \"Your son helped me once when my country was on the verge of collapsing. I can never repay for his kindness so please at least accept this token of gratitude.\"\nCedric smiled, as a deep breath escaped his throat.\n'I am receiving the benefits of your kindness...'\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "It was...awkward.\nRhea's ankle was twisted as she tripped at some point and fell on her face.\nRudolph was currently applying a gel that was hot on her skin and was providing some relief to her ankle.\nHowever, it wasn't the first time he was treating her like this...yet why she was feeling this...awkward?\n...Rhea already knows the answer.\nThat kiss.\n...she couldn't forget what happened a few days ago in the gymnasium when Rudolph suddenly kissed her out of the blue.\nShe won't lie, she was aware that he was attracted to her. And she also liked him, not just as a friend. But she was unsure if she wanted to date him right now. She was unsure about the whole dating thing as of now.\nThat's why she decided to take her time and let fate decide where they end up.\nHowever, she was taken by surprise when suddenly, she felt the warmth of his lips on hers. Mind numb, complete blackout.\nThey haven't talked about it after that. Rudolph was behaving normally around her...as if nothing happened.\nHowever, she knew something happened! She couldn't forget about it!\nNow, the dilemma was ....did Rudolph regret kissing her? Or is he waiting for her to say something about it? Or maybe he just wanted to comfort her in that moment?\nCountless possibilities and she couldn't keep her mind straight because of that.\n\"Rhea?\"\n\"Ah!\" Feeling his warm hand on her cheek, she flinched.\nRudolph pulled his hand away, regret in his eyes.\nRhea reprimanded herself inwardly for reacting so rashly.\n\"Are you okay? You seem pale.\" Rudolph asked in a gentle tone.\nRhea nodded, \"I am fine!\" Her tone was high-pitched, a clear sign of panic. Gosh ...why is she behaving like this?\nRudolph kept staring into her eyes, and the fake, exaggerated smile never faded from Rhea's face. She was just trying to act normal but failing miserably.\nAfter a brief pause, Rudolph lowered his gaze and asked, \"You hate it...when I kissed you?\"\n*Ba* *Dum*\nHer heart skipped a beat.\nHe finally mentioned it.\nOh no...how should she respond? She has no experience in this!\nHowever, if she doesn't reply here he would misunderstand, \"I-I don't hate it...I was just surprised.\"\nRudolph exhaled a soft breath before looking into her big eyes and asking, \"Do you not realize my feelings?\"\nRhea's breath was caught in her throat as he stared at him with a blank look.\nRudolph suddenly got up and patted the dust off his pants, as he said, \"Forget it. I don't want to force my feelings on you when you are clearly not interested in me. How about we continue the journey-\"\n\"Rudolph.\" Rhea suddenly called out, holding his hand.\nThe raven-haired youth turned to look at her.\nHer eyes were hidden by her bangs as she said, \"Just because I don't say anything doesn't mean I never realized your feelings or I am not interested in you.\"\nRudolph's eyes widened slightly as he felt her grip around his wrist turning stiff a little, before she added, \"I just need some time to sort out my feelings...can you wait until then?\"\nRudolph was...stunned, actually. Not receiving instant rejection was completely unexpected for him.\nThat's why the very possibility of getting accepted by her urged his lips to curve in a smile.\nHolding her hand, he said, \"Mm. I will wait for you.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nAustin reached the Capital by mid-noon. And as promised, Rhea and Rudolph were waiting for him near the palace entrance.\nAustin had to take a few breaks en route because Sebastian was not in the shape to run for hours without a break.\nThat brought the suggestion, \"After this war, how about you retire, Sebas?\"\nThe older man didn't seem shocked or anything.\nCalming his breath, he nodded, \"Although I wish to serve you until my last breath, I don't want to become a hurdle in your path who drags you down. So yes, maybe I might retire and spend some years with my family.\"\nSebastian prioritizes his young master's security over his servitude. Today, he finally accepted that he might no longer be fit to serve the Prince. He needs a replacement; someone who can take care of the young master.\n\"You are leaving, Sebastian? It sounds...saddening.\" Rudolph's tone grew dim near the end. He has been friends with Austin since childhood and surely has spent a lot of time with Sebastian as well.\nSebastian was like an uncle to him, so surely, he would be sad to see him leave.\n\"Well, not like he would go far away. I know where he lives so we can regularly visit him.\" Austin assured the taller one.\nAustin, himself, didn't want to part ways from Sebastian. However, considering his age, it was the right time to let the man enjoy some peaceful time with his wife and family members.\nSebastian has given his life serving the royal family. And now, this loyal servant needs to relish a few years of his life.\nSoon, they stepped inside the reception area, where a familiar maid greeted them, \"Good afternoon, Your Highness. His Majesty would be here in a few minutes.\"\nAustin nodded before asking, \"I saw a convoy outside...is he attending some guests?\"\nThe maid informed, \"The royalty from Drenovar has come to meet His Majesty.\"\nA chill ran down everyone's spine except for Austin.\nRudolph drew a sharp breath and Rhea hastily asked, \"W-Why was he allowed in the palace?\" Someone who has lived since the day she was born in Eryndor, she was naturally aware of the history Eryndor had with Drenovar.\nPeople talked about friendship, but Rhea's first reaction made it clear—this was dangerous.\nThe maid soothingly smiled, \"They are having a peaceful conversation, young lady.\"\nRhea was baffled at that response and so was Rudolph.\nAustin calmly sat down and told them, \"You all are worried for nothing. Just sit down and relax.\"\nRudolph and Rhea shared a nervous glance before deciding to trust Austin's confidence.\nHowever, Sebastian said, \"I will go and have a look.\"\nHe walked towards the conference room leaving the trio alone.\nA few moments of silence passed before Rudolph asked quietly, \"Hey man...can you give me a few dating tips?\"\nAustin blinked in surprise ..when did this happen?\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Rudolph is planning for the future, eh...",

      "content": "Valerie was a little horrified by the means of training Selner had arranged for her.\nShe was in the same time chamber, currently training for the war she would be participating in.\nIt has already been around four months and she has been through such an unconventional and unique method of training that she believed that the training until now was just to prepare herself for this.\nHowever, the method of training this time can only be described with one single word.\nRidiculous.\nBeneath and above were sharp spikes that would impale her without a doubt. Thin near the crown and thick as they go down. Terrifyingly pointy.\nThe distance between them was such that Valerie had to keep her feet on the spike, but not enough to get her soles pierced.\nHer Shiverfall was above her head like a hovering board keeping her away from drowning into death. But the problem was the spikes above her were so close to her Shard that she couldn't fully levitate as well.\nIf she lost control over her Shard, she would get impaled for sure.\nIf she put too much soul energy, her arms would suffer and if her control slipped, her soles would need to be replaced…\n\"This seems like an attempted murder,\" Valerie complained as she kept her bare feet on top of the pointed spike.\nIt was hurting, that's why she had to keep moving around, not letting her feet get dug deeper.\nSelner levitated there freely without needing to take the support of her Shard, and not showing any discomfort since she was perfectly hovering between the ceiling and the ground.\n\"You think so? Well, if I really wanted to, I could have killed you the moment you stepped inside.\" Selner reminded her that this was her domain, where Selner could use her powers without restriction.\nExhaling a soft sigh, she added, \"Look, you know I can heal any wound, that's why I adapted to this new and extreme method of training. Not only will all of this help you build a calm mind, which is very much required, especially at the time of the disaster, but it will also help you gain a strong hold of your Shard.\"\nThe training was focused on helping Valerie understand her Shard as a part of her body. And that could only happen if she doesn't 'use' her Shard rather than become one with it.\n\"Ready? Dodge.\" Selner suddenly threw a knife at her, which split into four knives mid-trajectory.\nValerie panicked and immediately ducked.\n\"Agh.\" A groan escaped her throat as the spike beneath her left foot drew some blood. She didn't lose control over her Shard, rather, she lost the grip slightly.\nBut there was no time to recover or rest.\nAnother set of knives came flying.\nShe twisted and jumped, her Shiverfall tilting slightly to cushion her—but not too much, or she'd hit the spikes above.\nOne knife grazed her arm this time, leaving a shallow cut. Warm blood ran down, but she didn't fall.\nSelner's voice echoed calmly like this was just another lesson in a classroom. \"Don't react. Flow. Think with your Shard, not your body.\"\nValerie wanted to scream. Every part of her burned—feet, arms, legs. But deep down, she knew what Selner meant. The Shard wasn't a tool. It wasn't separate. It was her.\nShe closed her eyes for just a second.\nBreathe.\nFeel the air, feel the blade, feel the Shard.\nAnother volley.\nShe didn't jump this time. She moved with it. Let her Shiverfall dip and slide just enough to avoid the blades. Her feet barely touched the spike tips now, just long enough to shift again.\nThe pain was still there, sharp and constant, but her mind was clearer.\nSelner nodded, arms crossed. \"Good. Again.\"\nKnives flew. Valerie moved. Blood dripped. The pain screamed—but she didn't fall.\nNot this time.\nShe was still standing—barely—but she was still going.\nShe can do this—her beloved believes she is the strongest, and she is well set on keeping that title for herself.\n----------**---------\n\"You cannot expect me to remain nonchalant about letting my son leave for a war, can you?\" Cedric exhaled a long sigh as he twirled the tea, which had turned cold in his hand.\nAustin was standing by the window, looking outside, as he said, \"Valerie needs to be there, so naturally, I will go there too.\"\n\"Can't I use my authority as the King to stop you both here?\" Cedric suggested…or more like extended his wishful thinking.\n\"Not even the strongest country could go against the command of the Council…so, it's pointless.\" Austin turned to look at his father. A few wrinkled lines had started to appear on his face, and when he got stressed, his face revealed that he wasn't actually young anymore.\nAustin's heart felt a little restless at the sight. He approached his father and said, \"Look, Father, sooner or later we have to get involved in this war. So rather than allowing the enemy to knock on our door, I want to wait there at the frontline and welcome them.\"\nCedric nodded, \"I understand what you are saying, but…as a father, I couldn't stop myself from getting worried about you.\"\nAustin knelt before his father and took his hands. Looking into his eyes, he said, \"I have sacrificed my chance to become the next king, but I am still devoted to my nation and my people. And to keep them safe, I need to stand before the enemy.\"\nCedric's shoulders slumped as he rested his hand over his son's head and said, \"You are nothing like me, son. You are a responsible, wise, and courageous warrior that this nation needs. Not only have I failed as a King but also as a father.\" Eryndor was the weakest country in existence, but Cedric isn't to be blamed for it, from Austin's perspective. He actually saved the country from being erased from the map. However, Cedric still feels that he cannot do much for his country.\nNot to talk about the lifelong guilt he carries for being a failure of a father…he couldn't help none of his three children when they needed him\nCedric brushed away the negative thoughts and with his gaze filled with familial warmth, the man said, \"But I am sure you won't walk on the same path as me and will become a true leader and a great father in the future.\"\nPatting his shoulder, he concluded, \"You have my blessing, son.\"\n…\nThat night, Cedric returned to his room for a few minutes to take something when he found his wife sitting by the window and looking out.\nCedric peeked at what she was looking at and found Austin practicing with his sword there.\nThe blond one rested his hand on his beloved's shoulder and said, \"He is going on a war…won't you at least wish him luck?\"\nSophie's grip around the curtain tightened as she said, \"I have always been a bad omen for him…I don't want to unintentionally curse him.\"\nCedric exhaled a long sigh, \"You need to recover from the past or you might never be able to live in the present. Austin is about to face the biggest battle of his life…and he would need the blessings of his mother too,\"\nSophie felt anxious…can she really talk to him after what she has done?\n---------**---------\nA/N:- I will add a 'Sophie warning' in the future chapters for the part where she would be involved, for those who hate her.

      "content": "Eryndor shares the northern border with Ademerg.\nThe shore of SOS(Sea of Separation) is in the west of the two countries.\nThere are two paths that connect Eryndor and Ademerg with the coast—one through the forest and the second the trading route, which is generally used by local travelers.\nTo enter Ademerg directly from the shore, the demonic army would have to cross the Great Forest where Austin found the Elixir of Life.\nAnd that forest is the playground for Austin where he has been playing for the past fourteen years.\nHe knows those routes better than his own house. That's why, he made a plan with the two rulers beside him.\n\"Keeping the soldiers ready to face the army at the northern border would be a foolish approach. I know that's how we always fight a war, but the enemy in question is an inhumane creature, so we need to change our way of doing things, as well.\" Austin spoke in the presence of Drenovar's rulers, the King of Eryndor, and a few ministers whom Cedric trusted.\nPointing at the forest which connects Eryndor with Ademerg, he said, \"We can station soldiers here, to lay traps and distractions for the demons to mislead and destroy them.\"\nThe Commander of the Imperial Legion frowned, \"The forest is too dense and confusing for those who haven't been there multiple times. So we need to send 'our' soldiers there.\" What he implied here was that to trap the demons, they cannot rely on the foreign soldiers coming from Drenovar.\n\"You are right, Sir Thomas.\" Austin assented.\n(A/N:- I couldn't remember or find Rudolph's father's name ༎ຶ⁠‿⁠༎ຶ)\n\"What if they took the direct path? Or the aerial route?\" Idris suggested. He couldn't forget about the huge dragons and wyvern that the Demon General brought along to destroy Drenovar.\nArthur suggested, \"We have stone canons and ballsitas which would surely take them down.\"\n\"Mm-hmm. It won't be enough,\" Austin shook his head—someone who faced those wyverns, he knew they needed to bring something more from their side.\nA brief moment of silence passed before Austin asked, \"Sir Hayden and Sir Thomas,\" The two Commanders belonging to different nations turned towards the blond Prince before they heard him ask, \"How many soldiers are there in the army who have long-ranged Shards?\"\nThomas heaved a sigh of disappointment, \"Only seven.\"\n\"Thirteen on our side.\" The other one added.\nPeople who can detach their Shard—part of their soul from their body—and use it as a weapon to attack the enemy are by far very less and rare. Because when you launch your Shard, you have to say goodbye to that fragment of Soul as well. Too risky and possibly life-threatening.\nThat's why, people barely use their Shard if their soul is shaped as a bow and arrows.\n\"I also have someone in mind who could be helpful.\" Rhea, to be precise, has the perfect Shard for this situation. Her crossbow could take a wyvern down with one shot, and she has an immense amount of Soul Energy.\n\"We need to assign them a spot from where they would be able to keep an eye on the fort and the forest as well.\" Cedric voiced, now convinced that the archers would be keeping the flying monsters away.\nNo one questioned their decision.\n\"I will arrange something, Your Majesty,\" Thomas assured him.\nAustin nodded, before he said, \"We have ten days. In these few days, we need to lay the traps and prepare the defense line. There is no time to prepare different squads, so I would request the two Commanders to pick your best soldiers and position them accordingly.\"\nThe two tall men nodded.\nThey discussed a few more things and the meeting continued until two in the morning.\n.....\nOnce done, Austin got out and prepared to leave.\nHe had no time to rest, and without training, he wasn't getting much tired as well.\n'Talking about training...what's my stats?'\n[Ding!]\n[Ding!]\n[Combat: 95/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Romance: 79/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[Durability: 95/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Trickery: 40/50]\n{Next reward at 50}\n[Overall Progression: 89/100]\n[Next Reward at 100]\n....\nAustin took a moment to admire his stats.\nFrom zero to the threshold of breaking the first stage of the system\nHe has come a long way.\nHe doesn't know how Trickery works, it was just increasing on its own.\nAustin wasn't very focused on it as well.\nBecause Combat and Endurance require a lot of effort, the Overall Progression has been increasing generously ever since he reached the 90s.\n'I still have no clue what kind of change the system would go through once I ascend-'\n[The host can ask me!]\nThe system responded, out of the blue\nEver since their exchange, she has been using her true voice and conversing with him regularly.\n'Okay then, tell me. What will I get?'\n[The system would be modified into—Quest and Reward mode. The host would be regularly assigned quests and useful rewards based on the situation.]\nAustin was surprised, 'No more stats? But you said I will get separate stats for strength, speed, and all...' Austin hasn't forgotten about that.\n[Ding!]\n[By then, it won't be necessary for the Host to track his progress.]\nAustin hummed in response.\nThe time he breaks into A-rank, he will receive the third fragment of his Soul, which would naturally make him stronger.\n'I might not rely on the system regularly-'\n[｡•́︿•̀｡]\nAustin...stopped, and then said, \"But surely I will continue to use the Dungeons. And how can I forget about the rewards? If not for your rewards, I didn't have won my first battle.\"\nHe hurriedly assured her\nShe is like an adorable little sister who wants to be just useful to Austin. And seeing her getting sad makes his heart heavy.\n[...really, host?]\n\"Yeah, why would I lie?\" Austin grinned.\n\"Who are you talking to?\" Suddenly, a familiar voice broke his focus before he turned toward the black-haired guy.\n\"You seem well prepared.\" He said upon seeing that huge bag on Rudolph's back and that armor he was wearing.\n\"Well, this would be the biggest battle of my life so I need to be prepared.\"\nAustin chuckled, before saying, \"Okay then, let's go. Sebastian is waiting for us-\"\n\"A-Austin.\"\nA familiar but unexpected voice called out from behind.\nRudolph's brows elevated upon seeing the person before he looked at Austin and said, \"I will wait for you.\"\nAustin didn't say anything and just exhaled a sigh.\nThe person slowly approached him from behind, and softly spoke, \"You don't need to respond to me...but please listen to what I have to say.\"\nAustin stood there wordlessly and allowed the Queen to speak further.\nReaching behind her son, she added, \"I know many things have happened recently...you are angry with me...hate me...but please remember there are two more people in the family who would be extremely devastated if something happened to you.\"\nSophie raised her hand but then stopped inches away from his back.\nAustin looked over his shoulder before asking, \"What about you? Will you cry or rejoice?\"\nSophie lowered her gaze, her heart trembled at those words.\nAustin didn't like to needlessly torture his elders, so he decided to walk away when, \"Ah, please keep this with you!\"\nSophie suddenly rushed towards him and extended a pendant that was shaped like a crescent moon.\n\"It is a good luck charm...my mother gave it to me,\" Lowering her gaze she added, \"I know it might seem suspicious that's why-\"\n\"I am leaving.\" Austin took the pendant and walked away.\nSophie's eyes widened slightly as she turned to look at her son.\nSoon, her hands clasped as she did a small prayer,\n'Whichever God is listening to me...please protect my son.'\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Do I really put the 'Sophie warning' in these kind of chapters?",

      "content": "\"Does she really have to?\" Rudolph asked evident concern in his voice.\nAustin shrugged, \"Things would be easier with her here but if you are worried-\"\n\"No, Austin. I will stay.\" Rhea told her decision.\nAfter Austin told them the necessity of an archer near the Capital who could take down the draconic beasts, Rhea made the decision that she would stay here—a place where she was more needed.\nRudolph was worried, naturally, since if she had remained in his field of vision, Rudolph could have fought to the best of his ability. After all, until the ones he loves are safe, Rudolph can face the whole world.\nHowever, asking her to stay with him just because of his worries wouldn't be childish. He should trust Rhea's skills and have faith that she can take care of herself.\n\"Can you give us a moment?\" Rudolph asked and Austin readily nodded, \"Sure, I will be waiting near the back entrance of the palace.\"\nHe soon sprinted away, leaving the duo alone.\nRudolph looked at the pink head with a warm look.\nDrawing closer, he exhaled a sigh, \"I know it's not fair to tell you to remain on the defensive when I myself would rush to the frontlines...but still, please try to keep yourself away from danger. Fight from a distance and escape if you must. Rely on others and don't think twice to jump on cheap tricks if it's about your life.\"\nCupping her cheek, he added, \"Remember, nothing is more important than your life.\"\nShe held the hand which was on her face and softly uttered, \"The same goes for you. You have to return to me to hear my answer. So don't be reckless, okay?\"\nRudolph smiled, \"Don't worry...without knowing your answer, I won't die.\"\n.....\n[A few minutes ago]\nAt the back gate, Sebastian and Robert were walking casually under the slightly dark sky, and having a leisurely chat.\nThey have been quite busy these days, especially Robert because the King has been getting involved in regular meetings to ensure that the nation is not heading towards its downfall.\nAfter the incident with Aiden, Cedric has shouldered everything by himself. That's why there is a dire need for an active heir to the throne who can share the burden of the King.\nBut until then, Cedric has to handle everything on his own.\n\"Do you think, His Highness will ever accept the throne?\"\n\"If things come down to it, I don't think my Lord would turn his back on his people,\" Sebastian responded a sense of certainty in his voice.\nAs far as he knows, his young master was a very kind and responsible man. If the Kingdom requires he wouldn't delay in acquiring the throne.\nA comfortable, brief silence descended before the younger one glanced at his brother and asked, \"Are you really retiring?\" More than curiosity there was slight hope in his voice. But Robert hid it well—not wanting to push him if he really did not intend on retiring.\nHowever, \"Yes, brother. I have decided. Young master needs a better server, and I have someone in mind who can replace me.\"\nRobert took a deeper breath, \"Well, you have served the royal family for forty years. So it's about time you take some rest.\"\nTurning towards his elder brother, he came to a slow halt and so did Sebastian.\n\"I wish you a happy retirement life, then.\" He extended his hand in a shake.\nSebastian chuckled, \"There is still some time, but yes, thank you.\" The duo shook hands.\n°°°°°°°°°\n[Next day]\nInside the meeting room of the main palace of Ademerg, a few individuals were gathered.\nAdemerg was on full alert—the citizens were being taken out of the capital, security was being fortified and the soldiers who were in different regions were all being called back\nAdemerg was hanging down a thin rope—if they fell, there was no recovery. They have to gather their best to defend against the worst.\nCurrently, the capital of Ademerg appears like a war zone. The military marched on the streets where civilians once roamed. Shops could no longer be seen. Houses were being used as armory and inventory for military use.\nEvery inch of the Capital was currently under protection or surveillance.\nOn their north was a tall mountain range—which most likely would not be the entry point of the demonic army, but still, to not leave any loophole, they sent soldiers around the mountain tops and base.\n\"What about the forest?\" The Commanding chief was asked by a soldier who was accompanying him.\nThe grey-haired Commander responded stiffly, \"Eryndor has already started sending their forces into the forest. It would be foolish to waste our forces there.\"\nThe route between the shore and Ademerg was one way—unless they decide to change the route, take a longer path, to reach the Capital they would surely walk on the path they had anticipated\nAnd that singular path was now laced with traps and guarded by hundreds of soldiers.\nSo, they appear to be prepared.\n\"I wish they first end up striking Eryndor. They might be weak but they surely can filter out the weaklings first.\" The soldier laughed mockingly.\nThe Commander remained silent on the matter.\nThey took a few more steps before the older one told the soldier, \"Stand guard.\"\nThe soldier gave a salute before positioning himself upright beside the door.\nThe Commander knocked on the door, \"It's me, Gareth.\"\n\"Come in.\" The familiar voice of the King he serves arrived from the other side\nGareth didn't think twice before twisting the metal handle and opening the door.\nGareth was about to greet the King...but then, his breath was choked in his throat upon seeing the people inside.\n\"You are the Commanding General of the Kingdom?\" The one who asked without any evident emotion in his voice.\nGolden long hair fell on his shoulder. Despite being 6'3, Gareth found himself behind shadowed by the tall young man before him. Wide shoulders and a lean build, which was perfect for a swordsman.\nHis piercing golden eyes were fixated on Gareth as if he were assessing him.\nThe Commander was breathless while standing before him.\nOne of the Pillars of Humanity.\nThe warrior who can pierce the sky and make the heavens descend.\nThe strongest S-rank in existence.\nWilliam Pegasus.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "There are seven official S-ranks in the world and all of them work for the Council. The only S-rank who isn't working for them is currently the reason for the King's concern.\nThe King of Ademerg--Eden, a blue-haired man in his forties, sat in the conference room along with the four S-rank warriors among which was the strongest warrior in the world.\nWilliam Pegasus is a name that requires no description to let people know what the man was capable of. He is the same warrior who stood against a demonic army all by himself when his hometown was in danger.\nHe awakened his shard at the age of three, which was unprecedented, and has lived in a world that helped…rather than forced him to continue to grow.\nHe was the one who ate the demonic dragon's heart in hunger yet survived. The only mortal who was immune to Dark Water.\nThere were numerous stories to be told about this twenty-seven-year-old man.\nAnd such a man, who is the biggest asset of the Council, was sent to Ademerg.\nThe King was expecting the council to keep the strongest blade close to them since the Council always prioritizes their own safety.\nHowever, he was, fortunately, wrong.\n\"Have we received any word from the Council?\" The sixth-ranked warrior, the barrier user, Charlotte Everlight, asked casually as she leaned back in her seat with her eyes traveling toward the blond swordsman.\nTwo more S-ranks were present in the room—the Third and the Seventh-ranked.\nThey all were here to protect Ademerg from its possible demise. And Eden couldn't be any more thankful. Now, he at least has a hope that his people will survive after the cloud of disaster disperses.\n\"They have already given us our roles. From here on, it depends on us how we operate.\" William voiced as he continued to assess the map of the northern region.\nIt was then that a knock on the door disrupted his focus.\n\"Who is it?\" Gareth asked with slight annoyance in his voice. Unless it's an emergency the soldiers were forbidden from disturbing them.\n\"Commander, it's the Prince of Erybdor. Sir Austin is here.\"\nGareth frowned before he turned towards his Lord.\nEden himself couldn't take the decision here, so he turned toward William.\nThe blond swordsman wordlessly nodded, before Eden gave his consent to the Commander.\n\"Send him in,\" Gareth said before the door soon parted and revealed the blond Prince whom no one in the room had met before.\nWilliam finally tore his eyes away from the map to glance at the boy, but upon seeing the absence of the violet-haired beside him, he lost interest.\nAustin glanced around the room. He was already informed by Selner that he would meet a few prominent figures of the human realm today. And as she said, he could see some canon characters sharing the discussion table.\n\"Prince Austin, I extend my gratitude for standing by our side in times of distress.\" The King politely thanked the younger one.\nAustin nodded before he informed them what they must be eager to know, \"Valerie would join us before the demonic army arrives. She is currently with Madame Selner, preparing for the war.\"\nCharlotte flinched and William also showed a reaction when that name was mentioned.\nThe seventh-ranked S-rank, Darius Greyhound asked, \"Are you closely acquainted with Madame Selner.\"\nIt was no surprise that they were aware of that name. As Selner mentioned she, at some point, has become the teacher of every S-rank warrior.\nAustin slowly nodded, \"Yes, I know her.\"\nHe was invited by the King to sit at the table.\nOnce the blond Prince was seated, Charlotte, who was not far away from him, asked, \"I asked from Madame Selner that you had a plan and you needed me for that?\"\nAustin nodded, \"Not only you but Sir William too.\"\nHe opened the map he brought along, which was hand drawn, and several lines and marks signified things that couldn't be found on regular maps.\nEvery eye turned towards the map as Austin began, \"The western coast that would be the entry point of the demons is quite vast. Even if we combine the army of Ademerg and the forces sent by the Council we couldn't guard it all.\"\n\"We know that, duh.\" The third-ranked woman with pale green hair shrugged.\nHearing her words, Austin sighed before adding, \"That's why we need to narrow down their entry point.\"\n\"And do you want me to make barriers at those points where we would be vulnerable?\" Charlotte asked, trying to piece things up.\nHowever, her barriers couldn't resist thousands of demons, and especially not the strong ones. Then, won't it be just a waste of Soul energy?\nHowever, \"That's what they all will think. They will push the region that would be protected, and once they break through, we will be waiting for them.\"\n\"Hmm~\" Charlotte's brows elevated. So, he means to fool them by pretending to protect their weak side. While they would be putting barriers where their forces would be densest.\n\"That can actually work.\" Darius agreed.\nCharlotte also nodded, \"Yes, it has a high percentage of success.\"\nThey can't defeat the enemy head-on. They have the numbers and quality. So they can lure the demons into a trap which would at least lessen their forces.\nSince everyone seemed to have agreed to his plan, Austin was about to continue. When suddenly,\n\"It can backfire if they actually target the unguarded area. Our forces would be less there and Charlotte and I would be in a completely different region.\" William spoke sternly, his eyes looking down on Austin.\nCharlotte frowned, \"Using the usual method we cannot stop them from pushing their forces through different shores. Austin's method would at least grant us the chance to take down a huge amount of demons through unified effort.\"\nWilliam scoffed, \"You really believe those Demons are idiots? Never underestimate your enemy or it's your death, Charlotte.\"\nAustin sighed, he was feeling tired already. This self-righteous and wannabe protagonist is annoying him.\nIn a stern tone, Austin suggested, \"Go ahead, Sir William, and make a strategy. If you can convince others with an actual good plan, I will just follow you.\"\nAustin folded the map and sat down.\nFor the next thirty minutes, William tried to explain the strategy he had in mind. But,\n\"We are going with Austin's plan or you are going to the frontlines without me.\" Charlotte relayed her decision.\n\"Same here,\" Darius added with his arms crossed.\n\"Don't mind, Will, but the kid got a better plan.\" The third-ranked—Thea Angelwood, added.\nWilliam was left with no option. Going against his comrades to force his decision would be unfair.\nHowever, if they are going to trust the Prince he should be aware of the weight this position carried.\nLooking at Austin, William said, \"Remember that, if your strategy fails and we end up losing more than we have anticipated, then you would be held accountable for that.\"\nAustin remained silent, his eyes never wavering.\nAnd that…was enough for an answer.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nAN:- People complaining about slow paced that I don't feel like giving characters enough time to grow.

      "content": "William didn't have a good feeling about this.\nNot only because it was a plan made by a kid who had yet to face his first war but also because this plan would put them in a vulnerable spot if the demonic army went against what they had anticipated.\nStanding at the top of the palace, he looked at the town before him. A slow sigh seeped through his lips.\n\"You are being worried for nothing,\" A pair of moon-white arms wrapped around his chest as a familiar voice reached his ears.\n\"We have a lot to lose here. Soldiers are human too, and the plan Austin presented would sacrifice hundreds of soldiers if the Demonic army decided to go against what he had predicted,\" he responded in a stern voice.\nIt never came across their mind to leave any side, which connects the shore with the mainland, unguarded.\nBut the main forces would be congregated at the front side where Charlotte would be creating barriers.\n\"He is no ordinary kid, you know. If he had prepared a plan then it means he has something else…a second plan in mind.\"\nHearing his lover's voice, William frowned, \"You seem quite confident in him?\"\n\"It's because you always remain busy with your training that you don't pay attention to what is happening in the world.\" She stepped toward his front, matched his gaze, and told him, \"He…recently went to the other side.\"\n\"…!!\" William was taken aback. There was no point in asking which place is this 'other side'.\n\"…why did he go there?\"\n\"To save his father-in-law,\" Heaving a sigh, she added, \"Although I didn't get much info from the teacher(Selner), it seems he hunted a strong demonic warrior to rescue the man.\"\nWilliam's brows were still tense, it was slightly unsettling and unbelievable that a mere teenager was able to dive into the dark world and return alive.\n\"He is close to the Teacher and also has been one of those who went against the demonic army in Drenovar.\" She further added to make her point about the confidence in Austin more concrete.\nCupping her beloved's cheek, Charlotte added, \"Age doesn't make you a warrior; it's the experience.\" With her gaze growing distant, she added, \" It's what is at stake that decides who would stay and who would run away. And that kid has a lot at stake. So trust him, Will.\"\nWilliam closed his eyes and leaned his face in her touch.\nShe is the only being who always says things that calm his heart down.\n\"Okay, I will be cooperative with him…just for your sake.\"\nCharlotte smiled, \"I knew I could convince you.\"\n--------**--------\nAustin was currently in the training hall inside the main palace of the Ademerg.\nHe was here just to spend some time since the two hours of the dungeon had already expired.\nHe has yet to reach the final boss of the fourth dungeon. The mobs of the fourth one were as strong as the mid-boss, so it was getting quite difficult.\nHowever, he wasn't rushing and taking his time. If he was destined to join the war without reaching rank A and gaining the other fragment of his soul, then so be it. He would play the role of assistance in the war and support Valerie to the best of his abilities.\nJust as Sebas, System, and Selner said, he was getting desperate to break into A-rank for the sake of power. However, brute forcing into a rank sounds self-harming so he refrained.\n\"What happened in the meeting?\" Suddenly, a familiar voice brought Austin's arms to stop the dagger mid-swing.\nHe didn't turn toward him to respond, \"They agreed to my plan.\"\n\"Heh~that's…quite unbelievable.\" Rudolph grinned.\n\"I know, right? However, it wasn't me who did the convincing. The Top-ranker got trapped by his comrades.\" Austin said with a chuckle.\n\"Quite funny it seems, it is for you.\"\nBoth teenagers were startled to hear the voice from so close.\nThey instantly turned toward the person and saw a green-haired female standing there.\n\"Well, we did force Will into it. So, the kid is right.\" Another voice, this time deeper, resonated as Rudolph turned toward the person and froze at his place.\n'Huge…' Rudolph was himself quite tall and broad…but in front of Darius, he really seemed like a kid.\nAustin's brows raised, \"Do you need something from me?\" He asked the lady—Thea, the S-rank positioned at the third place in the world ranking.\nShe had long green hair that cascaded down to her waist, framing a petite figure that, despite her size, boasted a generous curve at her chest. Her face was adorably youthful, lit up by bright golden eyes and a cocky smile playing at her lips.\nTo Austin, she came across as power-hungry, fiercely enamored with battle, and unmistakably arrogant. Still, at least she wasn't a traitor — a rare redeeming quality in his book.\n\"Well, we are told to assess our junior…that whether you are prepared to face an army or not?\" A grin extended her lips.\nAustin narrowed his eyes…assess, huh?\n\"Is it an attempt to bully us?\" He asked plainly but showed no sign of backing off even if it was.\n\"Oh, I would love to bully my cute junior but the orders are just to test you two.\" Thea chuckled, her sharp fang making her playfully dangerous.\nThe woman standing before him was already nearing her thirties, her body seasoned by countless battles — and perhaps even a few wars. It was important to remember that in this world, ranks weren't awarded through simple assessments or evaluations. To ascend, one had to accomplish more than their predecessor — and then defeat them in direct combat.\nHer title as the third strongest human warrior wasn't just for show; it was a hard-earned mark of her prowess.\n\"Shall we go there and brawl things out, champ?\" Darius suddenly rested his hand on Rudolph's shoulder, making him momentarily flinch.\nHowever, Rudolph would be the last person on this planet who would deny a call for a battle.\nWith a grin, he summoned his Shard and nodded, \"After you, senior.\"\nAs the two giants made their way to the other side of the arena, Thea asked, \"So, what about you? Are you not going to accept the challenge and try to impress your senior.\"\n\"I don't find pleasure in impressing anyone but a certain person in the world. And you are not her.\" Thea's expression faltered—for the first time her charm wasn't working on a younger guy—as she heard him adding, \"But, I will respect your position and accept the challenge.\"\n---------**---------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "The third-ranked warrior was introduced in the game because she plays an important role in the story.\nShe helps Rhea in overcoming the danger of Valerie.\nCanonically, Valerie kills the First-ranked during their confrontation and that battle announces to the world that a massive threat has arisen in the face of a being who once was a human.\nRhea understands the severity of the matter and also acknowledges her lack of strength to deal with Valerie.\nThe pinkhead realizes, after witnessing the between the new Parasite Chief and William, that defeating Valerie head-on is impossible. She was just beyond her league.\nDue to the lack of manpower around that time, Rhea asks for Thea’s help in luring Valerie into a trap.\nRhea’s specialty is Illusion. She can create the perfect illusions which even fooled a Demon General.\nShe lured Valerie using the illusion of Austin...and then something happened that Austin didn’t want to recall.\nSo yes, Austin was very much aware of what Thea was capable of.\n\"Come forth, Gleamade.\" She commanded before her Shard appeared in her hands.\nA long, flexible blade connected by blackened, shimmering links. When swung, it looks like arcs of moving light and shadow.\nIt was a Shard, which has gone through three evolutions. As such, it could chant magic without any restriction. That Shard can bend the law of reality and make people believe what’s not true.\nShe is a formidable warrior, especially against a singular opponent.\nAustin was that singular opponent.\nHe wasn’t scared...rather, a bit curious. While he was too far away from his full potential he wants to see how far he has traveled.\nFighting a being against whom he has a chance of victory, compared to an opponent who is completely out of his league.\n....that made his heart tremble. It was exciting.\n\"Looking at that smile, I suppose you are not against me using my Shard?\" Thea asked as she tightly held the chains of her Shard close to her chest.\n\"I wouldn’t have fought you otherwise,\" Austin spoke as he also wielded his dagger. The icy blue dagger faintly shimmered against the darkness her Shard was radiating.\nAt the moment, a hundred out of a hundred people would bet their money on Thea. That shows the difference between their abilities and experiences.\nHowever, standing before her, the blond Prince didn’t show a single sign of being nervous or hesitant.\nThea grinned, \"Let’s have a bet then. If you catch me within a minute, I will fulfill one of your wishes. And if you can’t...well, I will have you massage me.\"\nAustin didn’t say anything and got into a battle stance. Catching her, huh? That wouldn’t be that hard.\nHe knew exactly how to do that.\nThere was no referee. No signal.\nThey locked eyes.\nA moment passed, and then—\n*ZIIIIIP*\nShe swung her blade, aiming to create body doubles—however, she was rather baffled to see her opponent throwing his dagger at her—a bad move in her eyes.\nShe didn’t stop her blade in drawing a full circle over her head—a necessary ritual she needs to perform to bring her body doubles to life.\nHer head tilted to the left, having the trajectory of the dagger calculated.\nHowever, just as her blade reached above her head and Austin’s dagger reached inches away from her face,\n**THUNK**\nThea’s eyes widened as her blade fell over her head and she staggered back.\nThe huge shockwave shook the whole floor, making Darius pause in his tracks to check what caused such an effect.\nThea dodged the dagger, which changed its trajectory in time, and looked at Austin, who stood there with a pair of hammers in his hand.\n’Is...that his Shard? And he threw the dagger to distract me?’ She was now impressed.\nLicking her lips, she said, \"You have potential.\"\n\"However, you couldn’t stop me.\" Another voice resonated from behind and Austin swung his hammer on instincts.\nThe Thea behind him jumped over his hammer, pushing it down with such elegance that it felt like she was dancing.\nA grin split her face, as she backflipped and kicked Austin’s chin—throwing him off balance.\n\"I desired only to tease you a bit.\" Another Thea appeared behind him, resting her head on his shoulder and hugging him from behind.\nAustin tried to grab her head, but the clone disappeared in thin smoke.\n\"But now...I wanna see how far you can go.\" Another Thea appeared before him, her hands locked behind her back and a child-like smile on her face.\nAustin snickered, his Raijin appearing in his hand, thunder crackling from the weapons catching Thea’s attention for a moment.\nAustin twirled high, his weapon becoming alive with live bolts.\nUsing a huge amount of his Soul Energy he sent lightning rumbling around him rather than aiming for Thea before him.\nThunder danced around, like a tree growing its roots, and the whole training hall was ignited with untamed lightning.\nAustin swept his eyes across the room ..and he clicked his tongue upon finding more than two hundred Thea all around him.\n’I thought I took her by surprise using God’s Wrath...guess, I was wrong.’ sending a shockwave during the ritual was his best opportunity...but he failed to surprise the S-rank.\n\"What happened, Junior? Can’t find me?\" Her voice echoed ..and he knew it was the real Thea calling out...somewhere from the crowd.\n\"Do you want me to reveal myself? Is my poor baby lost?\"\nNot caring about her mockery, he focused.\nHe knew, if she wanted she could overwhelm him any moment. But she was just testing him here.\n’I can’t fight them all...’ Each one of her clones is strong so he couldn’t waste time fighting all of them.\nHowever, they are not S-ranks. Their attacking power and durability isn’t as strong....then, that means,\nA thin smile bloomed on his lips as Austin suddenly tilted his head and looked at the far end of the room\nIt was a round arena.\nThe dimension wasn’t huge\nHe had enough Soul energy left to summon them.\nAs such, he didn’t think twice,\n’Absolute Barrier.’\nTwo shimmering barriers appeared, one surrounding Austin and one aligned with the walls.\nAll the clones reacted the same, just like how their master reacted.\nShock.\nA warrior having more than one Shard was one thing...but a barrier magic?\nAustin didn’t give her time to process everything and instantly sent the two barriers toward each other with all the force\nThe clones started to get destroyed at a rapid pace and couldn’t resist the force of the Absolute Barrier, which was practically indestructible.\nHowever, at some point, Austin found a warning that appeared before him.\nThe barrier wasn’t able to move further.\nReason?\nAn actual obstruction appeared in the arena.\nDrawing closer to the woman, Austin said, \"Caught you, senior~\"\nThea stood there, unamused. Her hands folded, and the Absolute Barrier pressed her from behind and front.\n\"You got a whole deck of aces in your back pocket.\"\nAustin shrugged, as he pulled the Absolute Barrier back and allowed her some breathing space.\nHeaving a long sigh, she said, \"Okay, you won. What do you want?\"\nAustin parted his lips and relayed his request.\nHearing those words, Thea’s mind went numb.\n\"F-For real?\"\nAustin nodded, \"That’s my plan B if plan A fails.\"\nThea took a strong gulp, \"How...will I get to see his real form?\"\nAustin extended a paper in her direction, \"Here, I have drawn it.\"\nThea took the paper, her eye still holding hesitation.\nHowever, she couldn’t deny the fact that it was an excellent backup plan.\n\"If this is not enough I will ask Selner to help us connect our minds. I know exactly how he looks.\"\nThea was flabbergasted.\nLooking at the teenager, she couldn’t help but think,\n’Really...this kid is the real deal.’\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "For the next few days, all they did was arrange units and give them the orders to take formations at different coasts.\nThere were three points through which the demonic army could enter the mainland.\nIf they entered from the north-eastern coast, which they most likely would, given what the soothsayer relayed, then they would head toward Ademerg rather than Hener, which was nearly attached to the coast, or Eryndor, which would be much more accessible if they entered from the center.\nIf they enter from the north-eastern coast, they would head toward the vast forest, which could lead them to two nations based on their direction. In the east, they would find Eryndor, and followed by them would be Ademerg.\nHowever, if they enter the forest and head west, then they would need to travel for quite a long time to reach the kingdom named Valmora.\nNaturally, by now every nation on the human side has been warned and told to take security measures for possible attacks.\nHowever, the major concern loomed over Eryndor and Ademerg. Under normal circumstances, Eryndor might have been the prime target, but because of the prophecy, they were paying more attention to Ademerg.\nThe council headquarters have been vacated except for the officers who would be defending against the demonic forces. All the Council heads have taken shelter, far away from the war zone, since they believe they are the pillars that should not get demolished until the end.\nWell, no one could get against them because the strongest warrior in the world was devoted to them.\n...\nIt has already been ten days since Austin arrived in Ademerg.\nHe was now at the Headquarters, waiting for the demonic army.\nAlong with him were two familiar people, and all the rest were nearly strangers.\nSebastian couldn’t be ordered around since he only serves his Lord. And Rudolph was required on the front lines, so he traveled along with Austin.\nApart from the three, the three S-ranks were also present as a few official members of the Council were.\n\"Here, have this.\" One of the council members was distributing a small blue droplet-shaped artifact.\n\"This will help us to communicate,\" He relayed the use of the artifact.\nIt is the same artifact that they used on the checkpost, albeit the size was a lot smaller.\nAustin nodded and stuffed it inside his pocket.\n\"Did you have a word with the Teacher?\" Charlotte asked the Prince, a frown of concern written over her face.\nAlthough very few people know about it, it was a fact that Selner was the bridge that connected the two realms.\nShe would know the Demonic army’s movement and when they could expect their enemy to arrive.\nHer role is quite crucial in this.\nAustin was about to respond to her, when suddenly, \"Quite eager you are, Charlotte.\"\nCharlotte was startled and every single person in the room flinched upon hearing the voice of the person who undoubtedly wasn’t present here a moment ago.\nEven William, who can hear even the faintest of sounds around him, never realized when the woman appeared in the room and took a seat just on his left.\nHe gave a polite bow to the woman, \"Glad to see you in good health.\"\n\"How are you, Will? I heard you volunteered to be a part of this war?\"\nThe blond one nodded, \"If my people are in danger, I should be present at the frontline and stand as a shield for my people.\"\nSelner exhaled a sigh with a slight shake of her head. This guy never changes.\nInitially, she believed he was just putting up an act to be so devoted to public safety. However, once she started teaching him, his dedication to his training and his aim to create a peaceful world made her realize that William comes from that rare one percent who can take the arrow in his chest to protect his people. Those who believe in giving second chances to everyone, including his enemies.\nHowever, he considers demons his nemesis. There was no second chance in his books for them, and that was a major relief.\n\"I am curious about your Shard, William.\" Selner relayed as she leaned back in her seat.\nWilliam wordlessly summoned his sword and extended it toward Selner.\nAustin’s brows elevated as he saw the blade in his hand.\nA sword with a long blade that grows narrower as it goes down toward its tip. It had a red ruby situated in the middle of the guard. A thin handle with a round hollow circle at the end.\nIt was shining brightly, radiating enough Soul Energy to alert the guards outside.\nThe very presence of the Shard, which was also One of the Tools of Destruction, made Austin feel the difference between the others and the man.\nSelner hummed, \"You have been working..unlike that stupid brawler who just lazes around the whole day.\"\nWilliam chuckled at that and Thea grinned.\nAustin was not sure about whom she was talking about, but since the other S-rankers were aware of the person, she must be one of them.\nCharlotte hurriedly got up from her seat and raised the query, \"Teacher, how long do we have before they arrive?\"\nThe room fell under grave silence. The smile from William’s face vanished as he also turned serious.\nThey have expected to welcome their foes tomorrow, but they cannot be a hundred percent sure.\nAmidst the growing silence, Selner broke the news, \"They have left the shore and are advancing toward us already. It will take ten hours at most.\"\n\"...!!\" Everyone was shocked by the time they had. They believed it would take another day but...!\n\"We need to inform all stations and increase the security of the front lines right now!\" William bolted out of the room followed by others. They all had their positions to take and people to notify.\n\"Let’s go,\" Rudolph spoke and Austin nodded.\nThe three men got up and were about to leave when suddenly,\n\"Austin. We need to talk.\" Selner’s voice resonated and Austin came to an abrupt halt.\nHe nodded toward the other two and told them wordlessly to carry on.\n\"I will be waiting outside, young master,\" Sebastian said before the two stepped out of the room.\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"I heard about the plan you have made. There are people who trust your strategy and have gone against their natural leader.\" Selner voiced those words which didn't surprise Austin.\nBy now, he has already realized that Selner sees and listens to everything happening around the world. Well, everything that is important.\nThat's why, rather than surprise he shrugged, \"I suggested a method to filter out the mobs so we could focus on more grave dangers. What do you think? Will it not work?\"\n\"Predicting future...I have long lost interest in that. And even if I try to pry in your future, I won't tell you.\" The Witch who rules over time, declared with a stoic expression.\nAustin shook his head dismissively, \"I was just asking for your opinion. But well, you don't have to answer.\"\nSelner gestured toward the chair before her, asking him to sit down\nAustin was unsure about the reason but he followed her wordless demand and sat down.\nSelner took a deep breath as she leaned forward and asked him, \"Show me your Shard.\"\nAustin followed her words; summoning his dagger he extended it towards the woman.\nSelner assessed it for a moment, before nodding, \"You heard my words and restricted your training time. I am happy.\" She smiled, her eyes reflecting the genuine elation she felt.\nAustin wasn't surprised by that reaction since, by now, he had already realized how much Selner cared about him.\nAustin's Shard faded as he heard Selner saying, \"I know you are wise enough to understand this but let me spell it out for you. Austin, your soul isn't ready to bear the burden of the other fragment yet. When I told you to stop forcing your way to a higher rank, I meant to make you realize that one's soul doesn't grow according to one's body.\"\nShe further explained, \"Your Soul is not in your control. You can destroy it, yes. But you cannot force it to grow. You have to be patient with it. And with the pace you were leveling up, your soul would have crumbled even if you had advanced to the next rank.\"\nAustin nodded. Scratching the back of his neck, he said, \"I understood that once I got down from the adrenaline rush. I was pushing myself beyond what my body is capable of.\"\nSelner gave a quick nod, thankful that he understood.\n\"Now, during the war, there might arise a chance when you find yourself in a helpless situation...at that time, I ask you not to resort to accepting the Third fragment.\"\nAustin's brows knitted, \"...do you mean to say....\"\n\"As I mentioned, I haven't looked into your future so I can't say for sure. But this is a war, Austin. Your opponents aren't some scrubs, so you have to take every possibility in mind. But regardless of what happens, you have to promise me that you won't abruptly ask for your third fragment.\"\nSelner didn't have to spell out what would happen if he suddenly absorbed the third fragment.\nWhen you try to put a bucket of water in a glass, the glass breaks.\nAustin didn't respond immediately this time. And Selner understood exactly why he remained silent.\nLeaning closer, she calmly stated, \"You have to remember Austin...the only person who holds the most importance is you. Until you are alive this world will survive-\"\nAustin got up from his seat. Her words were making him think of something he didn't want to.\nSelner lowered her head and exhaled a long breath as he heard his distancing footsteps.\nWell, she tried.\nAustin stepped out of the room, a knitted frown on his forehead.\n\"Young master?\" Sebastian asked, slightly worried to see his master like that.\nAustin shook his head, \"It's nothing. I will just have a walk and will be back. You go ahead.\"\nSebastian knew that something was worrying him, but he didn't try to get an answer and followed his words.\nAustin slowly made his way towards the small terrace of the building from where the sea was visible.\nThe soldiers had already formed a fort at the shore and were protecting every side.\nAustin's eyes drifted afar, his mind filled with hundreds of thoughts.\nThe enemy was approaching, and he hadn't attained enough strength to be very helpful.\nAnd now, Selner has plainly told him the consequences of forcible assimilation of the third fragment.\nHe won't be of any help. He will just kill himself.\n\"I didn't want our reunion to happen like this,\"\nA wave of warmth washed over him. A pair of familiar arms hugged his chest and a familiar scent overwhelmed his senses.\n\"Valerie...\" He whispered, the name making his tongue feel the sweetness of honey.\nIt has been only two weeks...yet it feels like he has been lost without her.\nHolding her hand he turned towards the girl.\nHer bright eyes were faintly glowing, loneliness and elation reflected in them.\nHer beautiful face erased all the concerns he was tormenting himself with.\nJust by standing by his side, she has solved most of his problems.\n\"Valerie...\" He called out again, bringing her hand to his face and feeling her warmth on his face.\nKissing her hand delicately, he heard her saying, \"I wasn't allowed to come today too...but I somehow made it back since I felt you were troubled.\"\nAustin nodded, not even thinking twice before revealing, \"I am hesitant...don't want to put you in danger.\"\nOpening his eyes slightly, he asked, \"Is that running away from the responsibilities offer still valid?\"\nValerie chuckled. How can she forget about that? She suggested that they should run away from all this mess and start a new and peaceful life.\nHowever, things are different now.\nPressing her face against his chest, she said, \"Even if we run away now, they will find us....this danger is going to consume the world unless we do something about it.\"\nAustin knows it as well. The Demon Lord was a danger to the world...so running away was not an option.\nHugging her tightly, he told her, \"So let's make a peaceful world and start a family, just as we promised.\"\n\"Mm-hmm. We will.\"\nThe battle was on the horizon. Panic and anxiety were shared by every single human at the moment.\nYet, amidst the chaos, these two felt peace as they remained confined in each other's warmth.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "At the edge of the shore, an army stood like a wall against the rising tide.\nMore than a thousand soldiers had already crossed the wide stretch of sand, their boots sinking slightly into the damp earth. The ground trembled faintly beneath their weight.\nEverywhere the eye could see, men stood in tight formation, dressed in white vests that gleamed faintly under the dull gray sky. Dark helmets covered their faces, making them look like ghosts of war. They gripped their weapons—sharp spears, gleaming swords, and bows strung tight with arrows ready to fly.\nTheir stance was rigid. Their eyes, though hidden, burned with the will to fight. Whatever came into their line of sight—they would strike it down without hesitation.\nThe air hung heavy. A thick mist crawled over the shore, swirling around their legs like creeping hands. And within that mist pulsed a strange force—a gathering storm of Soul Energy that made the skin prickle and the heart pound.\nTanks rumbled at the front, their metal shields covered in scratches and dirt, while archers crouched low, eyes locked on the horizon. Every arrow was aimed.\nThey were the first line—the shield meant to keep the demonic army away from the mainland. They knew they wouldn't hold forever, but they had to hold long enough.\nBecause if the demons broke through… no one could say where they'd go, or what would be left behind.\nFour S-ranks, including Valerie, were present at the front lines. Darius was told to remain at the outpost of Ademerg and protect the capital.\nValerie and Austin stood side by side.\nClad in their armours they held each other's hands and awaited the enemy forces.\nThe fort created behind the Council Headquarters' building was giving them and a few others, the view of the vast sea.\nAt the moment, both Valerie and Austin were nervous. They have trained themselves for this day, but no one knows what kind of danger they must face in this war.\n\"I believe mountains would be better,\" Austin spoke, out of the blue\nValerie smiled, \"Forest is better. We both love to hunt.\" Valerie insisted\nNo one around them could guess what they were talking about since they started speaking out of the blue.\nSome wondered if they were making a strategy to divert the army towards the mountains or the forest.\nHowever, in reality, they were continuing their debate on where to go for their honeymoon.\nIt was so random, but gave them so much relief at the same time.\nHaving the blessing of the person you love beside you in a time of crisis is not something everyone receives.\nAlthough it can be said that Austin and Valerie have everything to lose here, they are the strongest only when they are working together.\n\"Incoming!\" a soldier screamed, his voice cracking with panic. Instantly, all eyes snapped toward the sea.\nIn the far distance, dark shapes began to rise from the horizon. Dozens—no, hundreds—could already be seen. But it didn't stop there. The shadows kept growing, spreading like a black stain across the ocean.\nThe soldiers stared, their mouths dry. Some stepped back without realizing it. From one edge of the shore to the other, the sea was crawling with demons—so many that the water itself seemed swallowed by darkness.\nThe waves churned violently. The air thickened, growing heavy with a poisonous miasma that made breathing hard. Every gust of wind now carried a foul stench—like rotting flesh and burning bones.\nWinged beasts filled the skies, flapping their torn, bat-like wings with thunderous force. They were massive—twice the size of horses, with skull-like faces and eyes that glowed red like burning coals. Chains wrapped around their necks and legs, tugged by hooded riders with twisted horns and eyeless helmets.\nBeneath them, sea monsters broke the surface. Some had long, eel-like bodies covered in black, spiny scales; others resembled giant, rotted crabs with legs as thick as trees and mouths lined with rows of jagged teeth. Their howls echoed off the cliffs, shaking the hearts of the bravest.\n\"KHRIEEEK!\"\nA monstrous screech tore through the air—so loud and sharp it made several soldiers drop their weapons. The ground shook as if the earth itself flinched. The roar came from a creature as tall as a tower, its skin peeled and stretched over bulging muscles, its face split into three vertical mouths, each full of fangs.\nSome soldiers froze. Others backed away, unable to tear their eyes from the horror before them. Many had never seen demons before—certainly not this many. And certainly not this monstrous.\nSweat dripped down their brows. Fingers trembled around sword hilts. Their minds were screaming to run, to hide—anything but face what was coming.\nAustin's jaw tightened as he scanned the demonic army. \"These demons… they're stronger than the ones Kalwar brought,\" he muttered grimly.\n[Correct, host. These are ancient ones—at least three hundred years old. The ones you faced before were infants. These creatures have devoured countless souls and absorbed many skills. Their battle instincts are far beyond the norm.]\nAustin clenched his fists. His heart pounded in his chest, but he had no room for fear. He had known this day would come. There was no time for hesitation.\n\"Charlotte!\" he called.\nShe stepped forward instantly, her face hard and calm. Her voice rang out like a blade drawn in silence.\n\"Make way!\"\nWithout a second of delay, the middle ranks of soldiers parted, clearing a path wide and fast for Charlotte.\nEven as dread crawled up their spines, they moved. Because if anyone could hold the front right now… it was her.\nCharlotte stepped forward, calm as a mountain amidst a storm. With a soft gleam of light, her Shard took form—a round golden shield snapping onto her arm with a flash.\nIt was beautiful and deadly: the core shimmered like sunlight on molten metal, while a silver ring ran around its edge like the trim of a blade. Ancient markings pulsed across its surface, glowing faintly as if waking from slumber.\nThen, Charlotte fed her Soul Energy into it.\nThe shield responded with a low hum, and in the next breath, two ethereal wings unfolded from its sides. They flared out with a sudden gust, golden and feathered, yet not of this world—like the wings of a divine guardian summoned from myth.\nAs the wings spread wide, a wave of clean, radiant energy exploded outward.\nThe miasma—thick, choking, and dark—screeched as if in pain. It recoiled from her like a living thing burnt by light. The heavy fog around the soldiers lifted, the air turning crisp and breathable once more.\nGasps rose from the ranks. The human soldiers watched in awe as Charlotte stood tall, shield raised, her presence casting a protective glow across the battlefield. Her armor shimmered under the golden hue, and her eyes were steady, unshaken by the sea of monsters beyond.\nThen, from the ground before her, faint golden lines began to crawl out like veins of light. They raced forward, drawing arcs and curves—magic circles that locked into place one after another. With a final pulse of Soul Energy, translucent barriers surged upward from the earth.\nOne. Two. Three. Dozens.\nShimmering walls of energy formed between the mainland and the incoming tide of demons, their glow flickering like firelight but holding strong.\nHope surged in the hearts of the soldiers. The shield maiden had arrived—and the land would not fall so easily.\nAustin glanced at William, and without a word, the man stepped forward.\nLight began to swirl around William's body, like wisps of fire made from pure soul. His sword pulsed with power, its blade crackling with streaks of white and blue energy.\nHe closed his eyes, took a long breath, and thrust the sword forward—not to attack, but to channel.\nA stream of radiant energy shot out from him and surged toward Charlotte.\nShe gritted her teeth as it hit her.\nThe energy was blazing hot—like liquid fire rushing through her veins—but instead of burning her, it filled her with raw strength. Her shield shimmered violently, the wings flaring wider as the surge rushed into her core.\nThen, the barriers reacted.\nOne by one, they multiplied—splitting and spreading like roots under a storm. Each barrier thickened, glowing more brightly, their edges sharper, more defined. A hum of power rang across the battlefield.\nThe soldiers gasped as they saw it. A wall of light now stood between them and the sea of monsters. And not just one—it was layer after layer, strong and vibrant, pulsing like a heartbeat.\nFor the first time, they felt it deep in their bones.\nThey might have a chance.\nThey could block the demons.\nAnd just as that hope ignited—\nTING!\nThe first wave hit.\nSeveral demonic beasts smashed into the barriers with bone-cracking force. Some were flying and hit like cannonballs; others crawled or leaped from the sea. But all of them crashed against the glowing wall—and failed.\nSkulls cracked. Wings snapped. Claws screeched against the shield of light.\nSome beasts were crushed by their own momentum, folding like paper against the unmoving defense. Others fell back howling, blood splattering across the ground.\nThe ground quaked under the weight of the assault, but the barriers held.\nAnd behind them, the soldiers screamed in rising courage—not in fear.\n\"The Parasite King is nowhere to be seen...\" Austin muttered under his breath. But then, something terrifying arrived and several barriers were thrashed.\n\"*BOOOOOOOM*\" A huge water dragon pushed away all the demonic beasts away, advancing towards the barrier before ramming its body into the barriers.\n\"No....\"\n\"...that monstrosity ....\"\n\"It's fucking huge ...\"\nThe barriers crumbled and Charlotte had to grit her teeth to prevent herself from falling.\nHowever, it was working.\nAll the demons were moving toward the center!\n\"Just a little longer, love. They are moving toward us.\" William arrived beside his lover and supported her.\nCharlotte has to keep pushing them to make this act appear better.\nBut it was not easy. Those barriers were her soul fragments. And every awakened knows the pain of having their Soul directly assaulted.\n\"They are closing in! Start the preparation!\" The Commander barked, and the big artilleries faced towards the sea\nThe traps were ready, and the warriors prepared themselves to launch an all-out attack once the demons entered their domain.\n\"Guh!\" Charlotte staggered, her eyes wavering and face pale.\nWilliam held her tight, not wanting the plan to fail when she had pushed herself so far.\nThere were only a dozen barriers left before they would be left with no option but to enter the mainland through the way, Austin has predicted.\nHowever, then suddenly,\n\"*KHWAAAAAAA*\"\nA loud cry of what seemed like a raven shook the skies.\nEveryone turned towards the clouds and found a huge bird flying there...and on top of it was him.\nThe Parasite King.\n\"Shit!\"\n\"No, no, no!\"\nThe soldiers started to panic, as they saw the demons suddenly changing their route.\n\"They read our move!\" William gritted his teeth and turned towards Austin.\nAustin was not looking at the warrior at the moment.\nThe Parasite Chief ...he predicted their strategy and now is guiding his soldiers.\nAnd now, the whole northwestern region was in danger!\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "\"What did you just say?!\" Thea blinked, stunned by what she had just heard.\nShe knew Austin always had a backup plan—he wasn't reckless—but never in her wildest thoughts did she expect him to come up with something so extreme. So… outrageous. All to ensure the demons wouldn't stray from the path they intended to lure them onto.\nAustin gave a casual shrug. \"There's no other way. You and I both know they might have reasons to ignore the bait or take a different route. In that case, I think this method is our best shot.\"\nThea ran her fingers through her hair in frustration. \"And how exactly are you so sure this will work?\"\nAustin hesitated only for a breath. \"I… got the information from Selner?\"\nHe tried to sound nonchalant, but the moment his eyes flicked away, Thea caught it. A tiny crack in his facade. She knew a lie when she saw one—and he was definitely hiding something.\nStill, it wasn't her job to dissect his every decision. Her role was clear: create the clone. Nothing more.\n\"Fine,\" she muttered. \"But if both your plans fail, everything comes crashing down on your head.\"\nHer warning was sharp and pointed, but Austin didn't flinch. Not even a hint of stress crossed his face.\nHe simply nodded, eyes steady. \"I'll take full responsibility. No matter what happens.\"\n....\n\"Thea!\" As they predicted, Austin's primary plan failed miserably because the Parasite Chief was hovering above the skies, a region where Charlotte's barrier couldn't reach.\nAnd since her barrier couldn't block the view from that height, the Demon General must have realized that they were being lured to the densest part of the military. Or to say, it was a trap.\nThe demonic army has already started to turn to the other side—the least guarded side of the mainland.\nIn a way, the prophecy would be proven wrong too here if they actually enter the mainland from the north-western region.\nHowever, that wasn't on Austin's mind at the moment, at all.\n\"Austin!\" Valerie suddenly shouted upon seeing Austin jumping off the fort.\nHe ignored Valerie for now and told Charlotte, \"Give me a platform and remove the barrier. Now!!\"\nThe warrior who heard the voice was no newbie to think first and act later\nShe heard the command and instantly removed her barrier, while her other hand shot toward the blond figure who was falling toward the ground\nA shimmering platform conjured beneath Austin's feet, providing him a base to stand on.\nAustin pressed his hand against the droplet-shaped artifact in his ear and told Charlotte, \"Bring me closer to the shore.\"\nThe barrier-user gritted her teeth and pushed all her Soul energy into manipulating the barrier.\n\"What is he even trying to do now?! It's over.\" William uttered through his gritted teeth.\nHe knew that trusting a kid was never a good option. He tried convincing everyone to evenly distribute the forces so they could minimize the damage and keep the danger away from the general masses.\nHowever, they all were convinced that Austin's method would work. And now, they all are standing before a dead end!\nNow, Charlotte also regrets not trusting William's method.\nThe soldiers were in chaos, scrambling to rush west—until they saw him.\nAustin hovered above the battlefield.\nIn an instant, silence overtook the panic. The soldiers froze, and so did the demons. Not because the barriers had vanished—but because of the voice that echoed like a thunderclap through the air.\nAustin stood at the center, high above all, holding by the hair an individual every demon on that field recognized.\nThe Parasite Chief's eyes widened in sheer horror the moment he saw who it was.\nStruggling, groaning, and trying to break free from Austin's grip was none other than—\n\"Your Liege! Your King! See how he dies like a dog!!\" Austin bellowed, voice laced with venom.\nWith that, he drove his dagger into Astaroth's chest and sliced down viciously.\n\"Aaaghh!! Khakkk!\"\nBlood exploded from the gaping wound, spraying through the air like rain.\nThe demons, all of them, turned their gaze to their lord. The miasma around their bodies thickened, reacting to their rising fury and grief.\nAustin grinned, his eyes wild, as he shoved his hand into Astaroth's open chest and began tearing it apart.\n\"AAAHHHHHHHH!!\"\nThe Demon King's agonized cry echoed like a cursed hymn across the battlefield.\nEven the human soldiers recoiled in fear. That scream… it wasn't mortal.\nThe Parasite Chief's dread turned to realization. No—this couldn't be. Their liege could never be this weak.\n\"KHIEEEEEEK!!\" he screeched, desperately rallying the demons, trying to break the illusion—trying to call them back to reason.\nSome responded. The smarter ones blinked and turned away, recognizing the deception.\nBut it was already too late.\nOver three thousand demons—those of limited mental capacity—could only hear their King's wail.\nCould only see him suffering.\nCould only feel the pain of their God.\nAnd then—something snapped.\n\"KHIEEEEEEK!!\"\nThe boundary of restraint shattered.\nWith maddened screeches and howls, the demonic horde turned direction, storming toward the center of the battlefield—toward the source of their God's torment.\nThe Parasite Chief shrieked again and again, but his voice was swallowed in the flood.\nIt was useless.\nWhen Astaroth suffers, the world turns red to his children.\nThey forget logic. They forget orders.\nThey only attack.\nHe may have commanded them… but Astaroth had created them.\n\"Take formation!\" William shouted, snapping out of his trance. His voice was strained, but commanding.\nThe soldiers quickly adjusted, parting to allow the demons into the trap zone.\nAustin, still holding the ruined corpse, drifted back—making sure not to be the first thing they reached.\nThe bait had worked.\nNow, the real slaughter would begin.\nAs the demons charged, maddened beyond reason, the ground beneath them began to shimmer faintly—then crack.\nBOOM!\nThe first line of charging demons was instantly swallowed by a chain of underground explosions. Spike pits opened, ether mines detonated, and sharpened stakes laced with holy inscriptions erupted from the soil, impaling anything above them.\nScreeches turned to dying wails.\nAnd that was only the beginning.\n\"FIRE!!\" William roared, pointing forward.\nIn an instant, dozens of hidden artillery stations across the cliffs and ruins behind the soldiers came to life.\nTHUMP. THUMP. THUMP.\nHuge cells crashed against the horde of demons, crushing them into a paste and ceasing their existence.\nThey hit the charging horde like divine wrath.\nBOOOOM!!\nEntire squads of demons vaporized under the fiery assault. Acid shells burst and melted through even the toughest skin, while fragmentation bombs tore limbs apart.\n\"Light cannons—adjust five degrees south! Prioritize the flying beasts!\" barked a field officer, his voice steady despite the hell before him.\nFrom the high watchtowers, white-hot beams of concentrated holy light pierced the sky and then slammed down like judgment.\nThe demon flyers screeched in agony as their wings turned to ash midair, crashing into their comrades below and adding to the carnage.\nStill, more came.\nBut the trap was far from spent.\n\"Activate zone two!\" shouted another mage.\nA circular rune the size of a plaza lit up beneath the largest demon clusters, glowing with a violet hue before collapsing inward like a sinkhole.\nSoon, frost began to appear on the battlefield as Valerie jumped in the middle of the charging horde and elegantly tapped her spear on the ground.\nIce shot outward from her, the demons suddenly were frozen in a huge quantity, their bodies becoming useless under the frost.\nValerie trapped hundreds of them at once and the soldiers destroyed the ice, claiming the lives of the demons at once.\n\"Gaaaaah! Kill them!\"\n\"Take this!!!\" The human soldiers were roaring and charging.\nThe artillery continued to fire cannon balls and the archers shot down whatever crossed the fort.\nIt wasn't enough that suddenly, the dark clouds parted, and sunlight began to pour on a single human.\nThe soul energy around the man became so intense that those demons who approached him were burned into cinders.\nWilliam locked his eyes with the hundreds of demons before him—they were now faltering in their paths.\nHis sword shone like a star, his figure barely visible as he jumped into the air and slashed his Shard towards his enemies.\n\"Divine Judgment!\"\nThe energy from his sword consumed everything that stood before him, the heat of the sun burning the demons at a rapid pace.\nThose who were on the ground and those who tried escaping through the skies, every single one of them were burnt into ashes.\nOnce the light died down, the previous army of five thousand was brought down by half.\nAnd the amount of human soldiers who have lost their lives could be counted on fingers.\nThe war suddenly started to appear balanced. Both sides have nearly the same soldiers and firepower.\nSeeing the results, Austin glanced at Thea before smirking, as he told her, \"Told you it will work.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Haah~people stopped reading, it?

      "content": "The war was far from over. Over two thousand demons still lived—many of them strong, brutal monsters—marching across the land with one goal: to kill everything in their way.\nThanks to Austin's plan, the demons had been funneled into the central path, the most heavily guarded route. It was a risky move, but it gave the defenders some control. From here, they could choose how to steer the battle. If things went wrong, they'd pull back into the forest—where thick trees and narrow paths would let them regroup, escape, or wait for reinforcements.\nRight now, chaos ruled the battlefield. Screams echoed. Steel clashed. Blood sprayed. Soldiers fought with all they had, blades swinging, bodies dropping.\nHigh-ranking officers barked orders, shouting over the roar of war, their voices hoarse. They dashed in to support their squads when the line started to break.\nFarther back, the heavy artillery kept firing mud bombs—massive shells that exploded and flung dirt and debris into the demon ranks. But the enemy had pushed so far that the bombardiers hesitated. One wrong shot now could kill their own men instead.\nSmoke curled through the air, mixing with the stench of blood, sweat, and burning flesh. The ground shook with each explosion. The sky, once bright, was now gray and trembling with the noise of war.\nAll the S-ranks were engaged in their battles against the strong Commanders working under the Parasite Chief.\nThere were six.\nWilliam was alone taking on three Commanders. He was the strongest S-rank for a reason—he was the natural nemesis of the Demons with his ability to absorb sunlight.\nWilliam's coat flared as he shot forward, sunlight pulsing around his body like a second skin. The ground cracked beneath his feet with each step.\nThree demonic commanders lunged at him from different angles—one with a jagged axe, one with a tail like a whip, and the third wielding long, curved blades that hissed in the air.\nWilliam ducked under the whip, slammed his elbow into the axe wielder's ribs, then leaped back as the twin blades slashed where his throat had been.\nBlood sprayed, but not his.\nThe axe demon roared and charged again, jaw wide, black spit flying. William raised his sword and swung it at nothing, but the light that erupted from the slash struck the demon and damaged his shoulder. Flesh melted. Bone sizzled.\nBut the other two didn't wait.\nThe bladed one carved across William's back—fast and deep. Pain flared. William gritted his teeth, spun, and caught the demon's face with a flash of blinding light. The creature screamed, clutching its smoking eyes—but William didn't give him time before stabbing him with his sword\n*SQUELCH*\nThe whip-tailed commander coiled around him, tail tightening like a snake. William's ribs cracked.\nWith a growl, he unleashed a burst of sunlight from his chest, forcing the demon off him with a burning shriek.\nThree breaths. Blood dripped from his lip. His shirt was in tatters.\nBut William stood tall, light glowing brighter now, golden veins crawling up his arms.\n\"I'm not done,\" he said and charged again.\nOn the other side, Thea as well, was using her wits and illusions to fight against several demonic warriors and their Commander who was a huge orc.\nShe was not going for body doubles since it exhausted her soon, rather relying on her shards and illusions to fool her enemy and land them at places where she wanted them to be.\nOn the other side of the battlefield, Valerie stood still—elegant, almost fragile in appearance—facing two monstrous demons, one of them being a Commander ranked. Both were towering beasts: one, a hulking chimera with twisting horns and a snake's tail; the other, a demonic hound with glowing red veins and claws that split stone.\nThe chimera struck first—its tail whipping toward her like a blur.\nValerie didn't flinch. She spun her spear once, calm as ever, and planted her spear into the dirt.\nTHRUM\nJagged ice spikes burst upward in a flash, slamming into the tail.\nCRACK\nThey shattered—but Valerie was gone, already leaping high into the sky. Shiverfall, her spear, shimmered in her hand as the air grew cold.\nWith a flick, she summoned three massive glaciers above. They hovered for a heartbeat, then crashed down like frozen meteors.\nThe chimera barely rolled away, snarling as ice shattered across the ground.\nBut the demonic hound didn't back down—it launched straight toward Valerie, fast as lightning, claws out.\nAirborne now, the two met mid-sky, eyes locked.\nThen—\nCLANG—CLASH—SHNK!\nA storm of blows.\nSpear twirling, Valerie parried, spun, and struck. The hound's claws scraped her shoulder, drawing blood—but she didn't stop. She drove her knee into his chest, spun midair, and thrust Shiverfall.\nThe hound dodged a hair and lashed out again, a claw grazing her cheek.\nIce bloomed in the air around them, their dance a blur of steel, frost, and fury.\nNeither gave an inch.\nOn the side, Austin was decapitating demonic elves who were attacking him from left and right.\nHe was using Raijin and his Shard to cleave their throats and cease their lives\nAn elf jumped at his back, his dagger aimed at his head.\nAustin sensed him, his left foot shifted and held his opponent's wrist before plunging his own dagger into the elf's throat.\nThe dagger increased in size, heeding its master's command, and pierced through the elf's head\nAnother one shot a bow at him, ushering Austin to bring the dead body forward and block the arrow.\nThe archer loaded another arrow, but before he could have pulled the string, he lost a significant part necessary to take the aim.\nHis head.\nAustin wordlessly thanks Sebastian who was doing his duty by protecting his young master.\nAustin then turned towards the soldier standing on top of the fort.\n\"Troy?\" He asked in the earpiece as he ducked low and thrust his dagger into the demon's chest before pulling it down.\nThe said soldier immediately responded, \"Yes, sir! The demon General is still in the air, riding his raven and showing no movements.\"\nAustin hummed and continued the hunt.\nHe has positioned the soldier there just to keep an eye on the General.\nThe fact the Parasite Chief hasn't moved ever since was unnerving, but right now, neither he has the strength nor resources to land the first strike. All Austin could hope was that the Parasite Chief liked the view from there and wanted to spend a few hours ideally.\n\"Young master!\" Sebastian called out and Austin instantly ducked, allowing the man to throw his dagger and stab the small demonic insect which was about to attack Austin.\nThe thing might be small but it surely would have given the ugliest sting.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"Without you, I don't know how many times I have died.\"\nSebastian gave a soft pat on his shoulder and told his young master, \"If I don't cover your back, who will?\"\nAustin smiled at that, but soon his smile faltered when he saw more than twenty demonic orcs advancing straight at them.\n\"Sebastian move!\" The Prince warned as he charged forward before he lunged into the air, his Raijin crackling with thunder. The sky darkened as all the illumination seemed to have wrapped around the blond one.\nThe orcs never had the chance to attack as Austin came crashing to the ground and struck his axe into the first orc.\n**CRACK**\nThunder seeped into the beast and bolted out of its back before hunting another.\nThe bolts traveled at a pace that was unavoidable.\nTheir skin cracked, flesh burned, and one after another, every Orc was under the grasp of Raijin's wrath.\nOnce the lighting subdued, only one orc was left standing.\nBut even it was staggering and barely kept itself on its feet.\nAustin heaved a sigh and summoned God's Wrath.\nThe twin hammers shimmered into existence before Austin dashed forward.\nThe Orc also raised its club to swing at the target, but when the two blunt tools collided, one side went extinct.\n**BOOOOOOM**\nGod's Wrath produced shockwaves that sent the Orc's body flying through the battlefield, taking a few of its comrades with it.\nAustin nodded in satisfaction. The training in the dungeon was paying off now.\nThanks to William, the sunlight kept shining over the surface, and the demons became weaker under the sun. So even A-rank monsters are easy to hunt right now.\nOnce Austin realized that he was not surrounded by immediate danger, he asked again, \"Troy?\"\nHe looked up the fort at the soldier...and found him leaning against the guardrail.\nAustin called out again, \"Troy?\"\n\"He won't answer anymore.\"\nAustin swung Raijin on instincts ...but it was blocked…no, more like it was captured.\nThe thunder died in the hands of the being who appeared behind him.\nAustin's eyes slowly stretched upon seeing the humanoid being...standing before him.\n*CRACK*\nRaijin cracked as the demon clenched his fist and tore the axe into fragments.\n[Alert! Raijin now...]\nEven when his beloved weapon was destroyed, Austin couldn't react\nBefore him stood a being who simply was too overwhelming for him.\nOne of the four soldiers who has stood with the Demon Lord since the beginning of the world.\nOne of the Four Generals, the Parasite King, was standing before him.\nAustin couldn't even lift his head to look at his face.\nThe miasma has locked him in the place.\nAll he heard was his voice, which told him, \"You shouldn't have pulled that trick earlier...and now, you are going to pray the price of it.\"\n*SQUELCH*\nThe Parasite King suddenly raised his hand and extended his claws—piercing the man who was inches away from stabbing the demon.\nAustin's expression turned pale.\n\"S-Sebas...tian....\"\nSebastian looked down at his chest...he knew his life was fading fast.\nAnd in the last few moments he had, he looked at his young master and faintly whispered, \"R-Run...\"\n**SQUELCH**\nHis claws extended in several directions and Sebastian's whole body was ripped apart.\nAustin flinched as his blood painted his face.\nThe warmth...it was blood....his blood....there was no doubt about it...\nSebastian...he...he was...\n\"It's not over, boy. I will first kill every single person you love before I come after you. Make sure you don't die before that.\"\nSaying so, the Parasite King disappeared—charging at his next target.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thank you for reading. You will be missed, Sebastian.\nQ",

      "content": "Was the demonic army let loose, all the aerial monsters headed toward Eryndor.\nIt was the closest nation to the port so it was natural for the rampaging monsters to rush toward the human settlement in view.\nRudolph realized that the reinforcement in that region was still too far less to handle so many monsters.\nHe was ordered to remain on the frontlines; however, the thought of Rhea didn't allow him to continue his battle on the frontlines.\nHe knew he might be making a mistake by leaving his post but until he could be around Rhea and ensure that she was safe, Rudolph knew that he would manage things better.\n\"I will apologize to Austin later...\" His figure blurred as he advanced through the forest towards the fort where Rhea and the other soldiers were stationed.\nThe fort was in between the shore and Eryndor to protect the capital from the possible terror attack.\nAlthough there were soldiers from Eryndor and Drenovar too, they still wouldn't be able to deal with hundreds of strong dragons on their own.\nAlthough Rudolph wasn't an S-rank, he knew for sure that he could create a big difference.\n\"*KHIUUUUUK*\" a demonic goblin jumped at him en route since he was marching toward the fort parallel to the demonic army\nRudolph didn't even bother summoning his Shard and simply caught the small goblin with both hands and ripped him apart as if he were tearing a paper.\n\"*UGOOOH*\" A minotaur charged at him this time, its heavy footsteps making the ground tremble.\nRudolph could no longer remain nonchalant as he summoned his war hammer and slammed it on the ground before the Minotaur could have reached him\n**CRACK**\nA huge spike surged from the ground, piercing the Minotaur from the middle and taking him high into the sky.\nAnother flying beast lunged at him but Rudolph was prepared.\nHe ducked just as the talons of the monster were about to graze his shoulders, and at the same time, he raised his hammer and increased its size.\n\"*KHUEEENG*\" The demonic bird was hit by the Shard, its body rising higher, only for a thick stone fragment protruding from his Shard and piercing the life out of the bird.\nWith each kill, he advanced towards the fort, his feet never stopping since his destination was set and urgency never left his mind.\n....\nIn the middle of the battlefield, a huge dome of ice was created which was restricting the demonic beasts from reaching the chanter.\nThe S-rank warrior who has been shredding the lives of the inhumane creature until now with a stone-cold face had tears in her eyes as she hugged her beloved.\nAustin wasn't crying...no, he was not responding at all.\nHe has seen his butler ...his friend...and someone who was like a father to him, die before his eyes.\nAnd he could not even dare to lift his head before the creature.\nCan there be anything more pathetic than this?\n\"It's not your fault...you could have done nothing...\" Valerie slowly whispered, understanding exactly what he must be thinking right now.\n\"...how is it not my fault? I...was helpless...so helpless that Sebastian had to throw his life away so I could run away ...\"\nValerie bit her lip. This was the first time she had heard him being so...empty from the inside.\nAs if, he has already lost all his hope.\nHowever, this wasn't the end. Valerie knows that his heart must have shattered in countless fragments after losing Sebastian but,\n\"We can't surrender here or we will waste Sebastian's sacrifice.\"\nLooking at him, she cupped his cheeks and told him, \"We might have lost the battle but we haven't lost the war. Giving up here means that others, our people...I...will also die.\"\nAustin drew a sharp breath. The very thought of losing Valerie brought his head back on track.\nValerie didn't want him to take the burden of her life, but if it was the only way to bring him back, she had no other choice.\nHolding his hand and giving it a gentle squeeze, she said, \"Let's not stop here...we need to keep fighting.\"\nAustin gave a small nod before he looked at the ground.\nAmong the many fragments of Sebastian's body, his hand was lying there as well.\nHe picked it up and rested it on his head, \"Please bless me, Sebas...I will win this war for you.\"\n•••••••\n\"Rudolph!\" Rhea shouted, her voice rising over the chaos as she spotted him locked in battle with a massive Orc near the edge of the fort.\nRudolph gritted his teeth and forced his Shard to grow larger. With a heavy shove, he knocked the Orc off balance. Seizing the moment, he slammed his weapon into the ground. Stone spikes erupted in every direction, tearing through the Orc and several others behind it. The ground shook, soaked with blood and dust.\nHe wiped the sweat from his brow, his eyes locking onto the one face he longed to see.\nRhea.\nWithout a word, he dashed forward, leaping onto a nearby artillery platform. Using it like a springboard, he soared to the top of the fort where she stood.\n\"Missed me?\" he asked, flashing a smirk and gently nudging her shoulder.\n\"Why are you here?!\" she demanded, her voice shaking. \"And why the hell did you bring all those demons with you?\"\nIn the distance, dark wings flapped against the sky. Dragons. Dozens of them. Rhea's heart sank at the sight.\n\"I didn't bring them,\" Rudolph said quickly. \"They were already coming for you. I came to stop them.\"\nHis voice was steady, but the fear in Rhea's eyes didn't fade.\n\"You shouldn't have come, Rudolph,\" she said quietly. \"You had your own post to defend.\"\n\"I know,\" he replied, his voice softer now. \"But I couldn't ignore what my heart was screaming. Over there, my absence might be overlooked… but here—\"\nHe looked into her eyes.\n\"Here, my presence might just change everything.\"\nBefore she could say another word, he turned and launched himself into the sky. His body twisted mid-air as he raced toward the incoming threat.\nOne of the dragons opened its mouth wide, aiming to swallow him whole. But Rudolph didn't flinch. He spun and brought his hammer down on its skull with a thunderous crack. The force of the blow sent him flying upward again—and he landed squarely on the beast's back.\nThe creature controlling the dragon suddenly locked eyes with Rudolph. Without a sound, it lunged forward like a blur of shadow and hate.\nBut Rudolph was ready.\nWith a flick of his wrist, his Shard reformed in his hand, glowing faintly with his energy. He gripped it tight and swung it in a wide arc.\n\"*KHUAK!*\" The demon let out a rough, guttural cry as the weapon smashed into its side. It hadn't expected to be hit—not this easily. Its body flew through the air like a broken puppet, crashing into the dragon's wing.\nBut Rudolph didn't stop.\nHe charged after it, fire in his steps, heart pounding like war drums. Before the demon could recover, he brought the Shard down once more—this time, slamming it into the monster's back. A sharp spike burst from the weapon and pierced straight through the creature and the dragon's chest.\nThe demon gasped, limbs twitching. Its control over the dragon flickered.\nRudolph didn't say a word. He simply stood over it, his breath heavy, his eyes still locked on the sky—where more enemies were coming.\nRhea aimed at a dragon rider and shot the illuminated arrow at it with precision.\n\"*KHUAAAK*\"It stabbed the demon in the throat and soon,\n**BOOOOOOM**\nThe moment the demon erupted, the dragon above let out a confused, strangled roar. Its wings faltered mid-air. That was all the archers needed.\nA hail of arrows streaked through the sky.\n\"Loose!\" came the command from the wall, and a wave of steel answered.\nThree arrows pierced the dragon's left wing. Two struck its neck. One lodged deep into its eye. The beast let out a screeching cry as it spiraled downward, crashing into the trees beyond the fort with a thunderous crash.\nAnother dragon swooped in a low, flames building in its throat.\nRudolph didn't hesitate. He sprinted along the dragon corpse's back and launched himself toward the incoming threat. Mid-air, his Shard morphed again, growing longer and heavier, perfect for a crushing strike.\nHe spun—once, twice—and slammed the weapon against the side of the dragon's jaw just as it opened its mouth to release hellfire.\nThe beast's head jerked, and the fire exploded sideways, missing the wall by inches.\n\"Keep firing!\" shouted a commander from below.\nArrows whistled upward like deadly rain, and two more dragons fell.\nOne archer took aim, lips pressed tight, and loosed a glowing arrow straight through a dragon's throat. The beast choked, then plummeted into the fort's outer fields, its wings folding like torn cloth.\nThe other archers also used their Shard to take down the rest giving Rudolph some time to relax.\n\"You are careless.\" Rhea arrived by his side and offered him some water.\nRudolph winked at her as he gulped some water and said, \"At least, I was able to impress the girl I love.\"\nRhea blushed upon hearing those words.\n**SQUELCH**\nBut the color from her face slowly faded as several long claws appeared inches away from her face—piercing through Rudolph\n\"H-Huh...\" She failed to register what happened.\n...a moment ago...there was nothing...and now...\n**CLENCH**\nThe demon suddenly clenched his fist and pulled back his claw, leaving a gaping hole in Rudolph's chest.\nRudolph staggered, barely keeping himself on his feet, as he turned towards the being who became the reason for his death.\n\"Y...You....\" Blood dripped down his lips as he saw those red eyes...\nThe demon growled, \"Blame your friend for your death-*SLASH*\" The demon's hand barely moved, and Rudolph's head vanished from sight.\nHe fell on the ground.\nDead and gone.\n\"AAAAHHHHHHHH!!!\"\nRhea cried, her body trembling as she saw Rudolph's headless body.\nEvery soldier in the vicinity has realised that a demon far beyond their league has arrived and has killed a strong warrior in a blink.\nThe Parasite King raised his hand, ready to slaughter another being close to Austin—when suddenly,\n*SQUELCH*\n\"Agh....\" Something pierced his chest....a blade...which brought back memories...no nightmares.\nScar.\nParasite King looked over his shoulder and found a pair of cold eyes looking at him with nothing but murderous intent.\n\"You will pay...you will pay for their death...\" Austin muttered before slashing his blade and bisecting the Parasite Chief into two.\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- You will be missed too, Rudolph.

      "content": "When Austin came to his senses, a cold realization struck him.\nThe Parasite King didn't just kill—he absorbed memories from his victims. And after killing Sebastian, he must've seen everything. He would know who mattered to Austin.\nAnd his next target? The friend closest to him.\nAustin's heart sank. He turned and sprinted in the direction Rudolph had gone.\nThe artifact wasn't responding, so he stopped people along the way, asking—no, demanding—where they last saw him. Then he ran, faster than ever, toward the fortress where Rhea and the others were stationed.\nValerie followed, even though Austin had ordered her to stay at the front lines.\nHe couldn't stop her. Not when she knew the truth.\nThe General of the enemy forces was coming for Austin. And to Valerie, nothing mattered more than keeping him alive.\n\"They're heading north,\" she said, eyes locked on the dark sky where the draconic army moved in a blur.\nThey were fast—but not fast enough.\nAnd then—Austin saw it.\n\"...huh...\"\nHis breath caught. His mind went blank.\nA massive demon stood behind Rudolph… its claws driven deep into his chest.\nRudolph turned, weakly, eyes still full of fight… before his head was torn from his body.\nIt flew.\nThen dropped.\nHis body collapsed with a dull thud—lifeless.\nValerie froze, her eyes wide with terror. Her legs shook. Even she, a warrior of countless battles, was horrified.\nBut Austin didn't scream.\nHe didn't cry.\nHe didn't fall into despair.\nHe clenched his fists.\n'System.'\nA pulse of energy.\nSoulwarden Veil—Activated.\nDarkness wrapped around him. His body vanished into shadow. A black sword shimmered into his grip.\nAnd in the next instant—\nSQUELCH\nAustin burst from the void behind the Parasite King and rammed the sword straight through his spine.\n\"You will fucking pay!\" he roared.\nWith one savage swing, he tore the monster apart.\nThe blade cut clean through.\nDark blood exploded in the air. The Parasite King was split in two by the strongest Shard.\nBehind him, Rhea was still frozen. Her body trembled.\nShe hadn't even seen Austin arrive.\nShe was on her knees, staring at Rudolph's body.\nHer lips trembled. Her eyes were empty.\nHundreds of demons started advancing towards them, sensing their Commander in danger.\nMeanwhile, Parasite King's body started to stitch back.\nAustin growled before his hands blurred—slashing, stabbing, tearing. In the blink of an eye, the demon's body was hacked into hundreds of pieces, each one scattered and soaked in black blood.\nMeanwhile, Valerie held her Shard above her shoulder before throwing it like a javelin towards the dragon, which was about to attack Austin.\n*KHREUNG*\nThe beast groaned as its body slowly started to get encased in ice.\nShe didn't pause there. Valerie stretched out her hand.\nThe spear vanished from the beast's corpse—then snapped back into her grip with a pulse of blue energy.\nShe didn't wait.\nHer feet flashed with ethereal light as she darted forward—right into the demon horde.\nThey were fast.\nShe was faster.\nHer spear tore through the first demon's chest. Before its body hit the ground, she spun and swept another off its feet, driving the Shard through its neck.\nTwo more came at her.\nShe jumped—twisting in mid-air—and hurled the spear downward.\nIt punched through both skulls in a single shot.\nAs they collapsed, Valerie held out her hand.\nWhip!\nThe spear was back.\nA clawed beast lunged from the side.\nShe ducked, then jabbed upward—her Shard sliding through its jaw, out the top of its head.\nShe yanked it free and kept moving.\nMagic pulsed through her legs as she dashed again, a blur of motion. A hunter raised his sword.\nShe didn't stop.\nShe vanished—and reappeared right behind him.\nOne clean thrust. The spear burst from his chest.\nBlood sprayed.\nHer movements were relentless. Graceful. Cold.\nMeanwhile, Austin was already moving—hunting down the scattered remains of the Parasite King.\nScar had devoured most of the fragments. But some had slipped away… crawling, writhing, slithering toward the nearby demons—trying to take them over.\nAustin's time was running out.\nThirteen minutes left before the Soulwarden Veil faded.\nSLASH!\n\"Don't even try!\" Austin roared, cutting down a demon that had just been overtaken. Before its body could fall, he commanded sharply, \"Scar, now!\"\nBlack flames rippled out of his blade.\nThe demon's body disintegrated into ash as Scar devoured the fragment within—another piece of the Parasite King, gone.\nThen—his instincts screamed.\nSomething was behind him.\nAustin didn't turn.\nHe simply commanded, \"Scar.\"\nThe sword obeyed.\nThe blade extended with a sickening sound—\nSQUELCH\n—and pierced straight through the chest of the approaching enemy.\nAustin turned to see a snarling demonic goblin skewered on the blade, eyes wide with surprise and pain.\nWithout hesitation, Austin gripped the goblin's head.\nWordlessly he slammed it into the ground.\nBOOOOM!\nThe impact crushed its skull, sending dark blood spraying across Austin's face.\nThen—\n\"RHEA!!\" Valerie's voice rang out.\nAustin snapped his head toward her.\nHis heart dropped.\nA towering orc loomed behind Rhea, its muscles bulging with unnatural energy. It had been possessed.\nIts massive club was already falling.\nRhea knelt frozen—eyes wide, still in shock.\nAustin knew he wouldn't make it in time.\nNeither would Valerie.\nBut then—\nTING!\nA sharp, high-pitched whistle sliced through the air.\nThe orc's arms flew off—cleanly severed.\nThe club still dropped—but now with only half its weight. It barely tapped Rhea's head before falling beside her with a dull thud.\nAustin didn't waste a second.\nHe flashed forward—Soulwarden Veil cloaking him in a dark mist.\nHe appeared behind the orc mid-step, sword raised high.\nSLASH!\nOne clean diagonal strike ripped through the orc's massive frame.\nScar howled as it fed, devouring the corrupted soul inside.\nIn the span of a heartbeat, the orc's body collapsed—leaving nothing but a hollow frame of bones.\nAustin stood in the fading mist, blade dripping black blood.\nHe turned towards Rhea and found Rhea was now accompanied by someone.\nHe shook her body and shouted at her, \"What are you doing?! Going to sacrifice yourself because he died? Would Rudolph have ever wanted to throw away your life?!\"\nRhea turned her eyes and was met by a familiar person scolding her\nShe was extremely vulnerable at the moment that's why she forgot about the past they shared and started crying while clinging to him.\nParkinson's arms trembled...unsure what he should do. However, currently, he knew she needed him, so he forgot about his hesitations and hugged her back.\n\"It's...okay. We will avenge him.\"\nParkinson couldn't have thought that when he joined the war, he would be met by such an unexpected sight.\nRudolph was a strong warrior, someone to whom Parkinson has lost in battle several times in the past so he was aware of what he was capable of.\nBut then, suddenly, a demon arrived and killed him in a blink.\nHe wasn't able to keep himself away from the battlefield, and Rhea, upon realizing that she has already lost all her hopes and won't be defending herself.\nValerie showed unease upon realizing the identity of the person.\nHowever, Austin held her shoulder and told her, \"We need to find the other fragments until I can hold the Scar.\" Without Scar only William could completely erase the Parasite King's fragments.\nValerie nodded before she disappeared into the thin mist and headed towards the battlefield where hundreds of demons were fighting against human soldiers.\nAustin had a worried countenance. He acted based on his instincts back then and divided his body into several pieces...allowing the Parasite King to send his body in different directions.\nAnd now, time was running out...only seven minutes were left.\nHis feet pounded against the blood-soaked earth as he tore through the battlefield, eyes darting, searching for signs of corruption.\nSLASH!\nA demon's head flew.

      "content": "Astaroth saw it all.\nDespite being in a state where he could barely move around, he had a strong grasp of what was happening around him.\nAnd he saw it. His nemesis wields the same weapon which has brought him down to his current piteous state.\nScar.\nAstaroth couldn't forget what that Shard is capable of. A Tool that was not supposed to be in the possession of a mortal, but it seems those higher beings realized where Astaroth could reach on his own; that's why they granted a single human with such strength that even Astaroth had to strategize against a human for the first time.\nUpon observing Austin that day when he was in the demonic realm, Astaroth realized a few things—first, he was nowhere around the same strength as he was in the past, , and because of that, he couldn't maintain his hold on the godly Shard for long.\nAs such, Astaroth made a plan.\nTo end this farce once and for all he sent one of his Generals to the other side with a small unit of army behind him.\nAnd the information the Parasite Chief received from his liege was, 'Hide when it appears. Attack when it fades away.'\nThe Parasite King didn't need to be told what could be the cause of his destruction and what he had to hide.\nThat's why when Austin appeared behind him while wielding the Scar, he instantly sent a fragment of his body inside Austin's dead friend's body. Later, Austin himself divided his remaining self into small fragments, allowing the Demon General to run amok and stay away from the being whom he had come here to hunt down.\nThe perfect plan.\n--------**--------\n[Time left: 1 minute 36 seconds.]\n'Shit!' Austin cursed inwardly as he grew desperate.\nHe had no clue how the demon got to know about the time limitation, but he couldn't stop to think about it either.\nHe needs to hunt down each fragment before the time runs out or he, Valerie…and everyone close to him would die.\n\"Valerie, move!\" Austin shouted, and Valerie instantly changed her goal from hunting the demons to jumping away before Austin took her spot in the middle of the horde and slammed his Shard, which had taken the shape of a hammer.\n**THWANG**\nA dark energy burst from the collision, wrapping around all the demons in the vicinity.\nThe darkness extended within seconds, and instantly, the whole clearing was engulfed in shadows.\nHundreds of demons, whether they were on the land or above it, couldn't escape the darkness as the Scar hastily devoured whatever came in its contact.\nOnce the darkness faded, only piles of bones were left. However, none of those demons were possessed by the Parasite King.\nPressing his finger against his ear, Austin commanded, \"Robert! Go back to the palace. My family is in danger!\" The butler, who was also near the fortress heard those words and turned on his feet.\nHe didn't delay in asking what was the matter since there was nothing more important than his master's security.\nMeanwhile, Austin looked around and continued to hunt down as many demons as he could.\nAustin dashed forward, eyes blazing. A demon lunged—he slashed its throat with a swift strike, black blood spraying across his coat. Another came from the side. He spun, blade flashing, cutting through its chest. It howled once before hitting the ground, twitching.\nA third tried to jump him from behind. He turned just in time, ramming his sword through its skull. The blade cracked bone. He yanked it free without pause. His breathing was heavy, but his rage burned hotter than any fatigue.\nMore demons rushed in. Five. Ten. He didn't care.\n[45…44….43…]\nAustin roared and charged straight into them.\nHe ducked under a claw swipe and stabbed upward, splitting the demon's jaw. One grabbed his arm—he slammed his knee into its face, then drove his sword into its gut, twisting until it stopped moving.\nSensing the incoming horde of orcs, Austin changed the shape of the Scar.\nPulling the string, he shot an arrow covered with mist toward the horde, and as the arrow pierced through the crowd, their flesh and blood were soaked into darkness, and bones soon scattered on the ground.\n[36…35…34….]\nA few dragons made a formation above him, flames bubbling inside their maws.\nAustin growled as he shot another arrow, which phased through the ring they had formed and halted mid-air—before a rain of black droplets started showering over the beasts, burning them alive as they tried to get away. However, the darkness has already started corroding their bodies and ceasing their existence.\n[7…6…5….]\nAustin came to a standstill, his heart beating loudly in his ear as he looked around.\nHe couldn't find the main body of the parasite King and his usual body isn't capable of even looking at him in the eye.\nIt was a…\n[3…2…]\n…losing battle.\n[Ding!]\n[Times up! Soulwarden Veil is deactivated!]\nAustin had to release Scar since his soul was pitifully weak to even hold it for a fraction of a second.\nAnd just as Scar dissolved into nothingness, a huge golem appeared behind Austin—fist coiled back and eyes filled with blood lust.\nAustin only had the time to turn toward the beast and raise his hands.\nHowever, it wasn't enough. He knew he wouldn't be able to block that!\n\"DIE-\" The hoarse voice of the demon was frozen, and not only his voice but his whole body was encased in a prison that was impossible to break.\nStanding there with her spear thrust into the ground and freezing waves extruding from the whole person was Austin's guardian.\nValerie concentrated all her focus on creating the time chamber, which was impossible for anyone to breach.\nThe beast, despite being caged, moved its eyes and again,\n*GUOOOOH*\nAnother possessed beast, a howling wolf lunged at Austin, claws extended.\nAnd again, the beast was frozen mid-air, its body getting sealed in the chamber where time flows according to how the chanter wills.\nAustin just stood there, his hands holding his Shard and ready to engage.\nSeveral more monsters lunged at him—dragons, orcs, elves, and whatnot. However, Valerie used her S-rank spell on all of them, freezing them at their spot for eternity.\nShe knew if she had killed them using a normal skill, the fragment of the Demon General would have escaped. That's why she was locking them in a cage where she could bend the law of reality.\nWithin a few minutes, more than twelve beasts were frozen in the time chamber, and because of the excessive use of magic, Valerie's complexion turned slightly pale.\n\"They stopped...thankfully,\" Parkinson muttered aloud as a breath of relief seeped through his lips.\nRhea has somehow returned to her senses and was standing beside Parkinson.\nShe also was ready to defend Austin since every monster was coming after him, but she didn't need to worry. The strongest of them was here to protect him.\nAustin looked at Valerie, a smile on his face.\nValerie also looked at him with relief in her eyes, her shoulders slumping as she finally pulled out her spear from the ground—\n*SQUELCH*\n—only to freeze as suddenly something bit her neck and green veins started protruding all over her neck.\n\"VALERIE!\" Austin cried as he saw her legs trembling and her eyes rolling back.\nRhea and Parkinson instantly advanced towards her and Austin also approached her, when suddenly.\n\"You think you can worry about her?\" A voice...a familiar one, resonated as Austin froze at his place.\nThe dead beasts on the ground suddenly extended their hands and under the Absolute Command of their general, even the dead monsters clung to Austin's legs—locking him in place.\nAustin stabbed them and kicked them away. However, the fatigue of using the Soulwarden Veil has lowered his abilities by a significant margin.\nFrom the dead rose his best friend.\nHis head was still missing but he got up on his feet and turned towards Austin.\n\"I would have honored our battle, had you not faked that cowardly act before. And now—\" Rudolph's body vanished in an instant and Austin instantly summoned the Stopwatch from his Inventory.\nRudolph appeared inches before him, the sudden appearance startling Austin as the Stopwatch slipped from his grasp and fell down.\nRudolph's fingers, which had turned into claws, were inches before him.\nAustin's breath was caught in his throat as he froze at his spot—helplessly watching his death from inches away.\n\"....now die!\" The claws reached Austin's chest—and then,\n*TING*\nSuddenly, a shimmering silver barrier was erected, the pendant on Austin's neck shining brightly.\n\"Khuk!\" However, the strength of the Parasite King was too strong.\nSeeing the cracks forming on the barrier Austin didn't think twice before commanding,\n\"SYSTEM! SEND ME TO THE DUNGEON!\"\nAustin's vision shifted and instantly he was pushed into the dungeon's resting area\n*Dhak*\nAustin fell on his knees, breathing rapidly. Sweat dripped down his face as he took a few moments to calm himself down.\nOnce his breathing calmed down a little, Austin looked up and found several of the system's messages popping up.\n[Host's life is sensed to be in danger!]\n[Emergency evacuation: Successful.]\n[Considering the danger, the current time limitation on dungeons is removed.]\n[The danger level has been significantly elevated!]\n[Considering the necessity of progression, the host is required to cross the fourth, fifth, and sixth dungeons to return to the real world.]\n[All the shop items' price is halved during the raid.]\n[All the limitations on Host's skills have been removed.]\nAustin was startled.\nWas this...an opportunity for him to attain the third fragment?\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Austin has been in the waiting area for the past two hours, calming himself down as he sat and recalled whatever happened in these few minutes.\nAn hour ago, the demonic army launched an attack on the human realm and Austin has already lost two of the most precious people to him\nAnd the one who was dearest to him was on the verge of leaving the world.\nEven when Austin was trying to digest the fact so he could look forward, he simply couldn't\nHe never anticipated that things would go in such a disastrous direction.\nThe Parasite King would succeed in harming him so brutally, breaking him emotionally and nearly ending his life as well.\nHe severely underestimated his foe just because Austin had slaughtered the Demon Lord's daughter with ease.\nSelner warned him more than once that the Generals of the Demon King are far more intelligent and experienced. Despite being in a rage, they use their minds calmly and make rational decisions to break their enemies. However, Austin believed he had everything planned, and that he would simply overwhelm him using Scar.\n...but, the ace he was saving became the cause of his loss.\nHe acted up based on his impulse, and now, he was here, hiding from reality and supposed to prepare for the battle.\n'Why should even I try to save myself anymore...Valerie is gone...' A life without Valerie...even if he tried to, he couldn't think of spending a life of which she wouldn't be a part.\nEvery trivial thing in his day-to-day life would remind him of her.\nHer waiting for him near the fountain. Sharing the same desk. Having lunch together. Austin waiting for her in his room, so she knocks on his window and jumps inside his room sneakily.\nHow will he live those moments again? It would be a slow death for him. He would die every single day while remembering her.\nSo, the question appears in his mind, 'Should I even stay here?'\n[Yes, you should, Host. Since there is still hope that you can save your lover using the Elixir.]\nHearing those words, a very faint ember of hope appeared in his eyes...but then, \"I saw her falling before my eyes ..a normal parasite wouldn't have been able to damage her to that extent.\"\n[But she was weak at that time. And I brought you here after a few seconds she fell. If you return and feed her the Elixir then I have a very positive feeling that you will be able to see her again.]\nAustin bit his lips, tears welling up in his eyes as he shook his head, \"Please don't...don't give me false hope...it's painful...\" Living with the hope that he would be able to save Valerie one day...only to lose her once he gets out and face reality.\nHe couldn't do it. He wasn't strong enough.\n\"You are not alone in this,\" Austin froze as suddenly he felt warmth enveloping him.\nHe couldn't see anyone around but there definitely was someone hugging him...and that voice...it belonged to the system.\n\"It will be okay, I promise you. She will be fine. You just need to be strong enough to protect her this time.\" She continued to speak, softly as if she was singing a lullaby and calming down a child.\nAustin slowly nodded, wiping his tears he hummed, \"I trust you.\"\nNone of them spoke after that. Austin just remained kneeling there, taking some time to calm himself down before he could think of something.\n...\n\"Ah... thanks, System.\"\nAfter a few minutes of sitting quietly and sipping some water, Austin let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. That small gesture of support meant more than he could express. Without it, he might've thrown himself back into the fight, not caring whether he lived or died.\n[The system will make sure the host reaches the life he truly desires.]\nThere was no face, no voice filled with warmth—just plain text on a screen. Yet, somehow, Austin felt like she was smiling at him. A soft, quiet kind of smile.\nHe couldn't help but return one of his own before leaning back and scrolling through the earlier notifications.\n\"Hmm... so I can stay here until I conquer the sixth dungeon, huh?\"\n[Yes, host. That will be enough for you to absorb the third fragment.]\nAustin raised his eyebrows. \"But... will the soul fragments even appear in here?\"\nThis place wasn't real—not in the way the world outside was. The dungeon was like a frozen stage created just for him. Time didn't move here. Nothing from the outside could reach in. That's why he wasn't sure.\n[The soul fragments are locked away in a cage. That cage doesn't follow the normal flow of time and space either. A witch created it, after all.]\nAustin blinked. \"You know that much?\"\n[Ehe~ praise me more.]\nA quiet chuckle left his lips. He gave a small smile, the kind you give someone who always shows up for you. \"You've done well,\" he said, meaning it.\nSo that meant... even while being here, he could still absorb the fragment. That was one less thing to worry about.\nAs he read further, he noticed two more things: the shop items were now cheaper—and the dungeon's difficulty had gone up.\n\"Why raise the difficulty, though? And why tell me to clear the sixth dungeon when I only need to reach the fifth to become an A-rank? What's the reason, System?\"\n[Ding!]\n[You'll soon reach the point where your soul can absorb the third fragment. But since you're reaching that point faster than usual, your soul might not be strong enough to handle it. That's why the sixth dungeon is important—it'll help grow your soul, like making a bigger cup to hold more water. This way, there's less risk.]\nThe System's voice was as calm as ever. No emotion, but somehow still comforting.\nAustin slowly nodded, taking it in. \"That's... actually a smart way to do things.\" Austin hummed.\nAfter reading the last two notifications, Austin's eyes shot wide open. \"You… removed the restrictions on my skills?\"\n[Yes, host. All time limits on your skills have been lifted—except for Soulwarden Vein, which still places extreme strain on your soul. Still, abilities like Berserk can carry dangerous after-effects if used too recklessly. Please proceed with caution.]\n\"…Damn.\"\nAustin sat there for a moment, stunned. His mind buzzed with possibilities. No more timers. No more holding back.\nThe thought alone made his heart race. Just how easily could he overwhelm his enemies now? The idea of chaining Kinetic Surge over and over again until his foes couldn't even move... or activating Absolute Barrier and calmly standing in the middle of a horde, drinking tea like it was just another afternoon—\nIt almost felt unfair.\nWith one simple change, the System had tilted the balance in his favor. The battles ahead suddenly seemed far less daunting, and far more exciting.\nAustin leaned back, a slow smile spreading across his face. \"You really want me to win, don't you?\"\nThe System didn't reply. But somehow, he felt the answer was already clear.\nAustin sighdd and looked into his inventory.\nHe has already lost Ashen Maul, and during his encounter with the Parasite King, Raijin crumbled into dust.\nNow, he has only his Shard, Wisp, and God's Wrath.\nAlthough he could buy a few weapons, Austin decided to save those points for now and, this time, buy a high-ranking weapon.\nSomething like,\n[Name: Arthain]\n[Rank: A]\n[Type: Long-Range Weapon]\n[Description: A high-grade magic pulse gun capable of unleashing a variety of specialized projectiles. From explosive Dust Bombs to scorching Lava Bulbs, precision-based Gravity Pulls, and corrosive Venom Strikes—Arthain offers both versatility and power in the heat of battle.]\n[Price: 32,000 → 16,000]\nHe was now focused on increasing his arsenal and adding all kinds of weapons rather than depending on a single type.\nThere were many artifacts and tools as well he would need for the battle.\nNot to talk about he was quite close to breaking through to the next stage as well.\nHe has lost many things, but he still has hope...that he can make things right.\n\"Haah...I think I am now ready to face the challenge.\"\nAustin looked at the vast ocean before him. He has to defeat the final boss of the fourth dungeon. A being whom he even couldn't touch previously.\nHowever, now, with Valerie's life on the line, he knew he could do it.\n\"System, start the trials.\"\n[Command accepted!]\nThe resting zone turned red before the barrier was lifted, leaving Austin face-to-face with the giant Kraken.\nHe took a deep breath, his left hand holding his Shard and his right one holding the boomerang.\n'Just a few moments Val...I will save you.'\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- For the next two chapters, things would happen in fast forward so Austin finishes his trials.

      "content": "Austin floated in the deep, cold water, calmly breathing, thanks to Aqua Lungs. His limbs drifted around him as he thought about how to deal with the oversized octopus lurking nearby.\nBut his thoughts were cut short.\nTwo slick tentacles shot out from the dark and coiled tightly around his wrists, yanking him forward.\n\"Tch, persistent bastard,\" Austin growled, now face-to-face with the massive boss monster—one worth five thousand experience points.\nThe Kraken's glowing red eyes burned with hunger and fury. It was clear no one had dared to enter its domain before.\nGRRRRRRRRRRR\nThe water trembled around him as the beast snarled. Austin winced—his arms were being pulled hard.\n\"Guh!\" He clenched his teeth, his veins bulging with tension. \"Berserk!\"\nBOOM\nA surge of power flooded his body—his strength and endurance skyrocketed. His muscles swelled, biceps flexing like coiled springs as he fought back.\nWith all his might, he drew his wrists closer to his mouth.\nThen—\nCHOMP!\n\"GREYYYYAAHH!!\" The Kraken shrieked in pain as Austin bit through the slimy tentacle, tearing it clean off.\nHe immediately spat the foul meat, face twisting in disgust. \"Disgusting.\"\nBut before he could charge again—\nSFOOOOOOO\nA thick, black cloud burst into the water.\nThe Kraken's defense mechanism.\nAustin's vision turned to pitch-black in an instant. No light. No movement. Nothing but ink.\nHe narrowed his eyes.\n'Fine. Then I'll play dirty, too. Piercing Gaze.'\nThe skill activated. It was part of the Aqua Lungs set—and it let him see through anything. Fog. Smoke. Even shadows.\nThe darkness around him faded from his sight, revealing the now-empty water.\nAustin calmly scanned the area, eyes glowing faintly.\nThe Kraken was gone.\nBut not for long.\nAustin summoned his Shard, the weapon stretching long and sharp as he spun it behind him—SLASH!—cutting through the monster's slimy tentacles.\n\"KHIEEK!\" the Kraken screeched, furious. But this time, instead of ink, something far worse poured from its swirling, wormhole-like mouth.\n'Shit—' Austin reacted fast. He increased the weight of his Shard, dragging himself deeper into the water just in time to dodge a glowing blob of acid.\nMore acid came—neon and violent, sizzling through the water as the Kraken kept launching them. Austin darted in every direction, his strong arms pushing him faster than most could swim, dodging death again and again.\nBut the Kraken wasn't stupid. It paused...then unleashed a wide wave of acid, spreading it like a deadly curtain.\nAustin's eyes shot open. He raised his Absolute Barrier—just in time—but not fast enough.\nHISSSSS\n\"Aghh...\" he grunted as burning pain seared his shoulder and side. His skin sizzled, and his muscles twitched under the pain. Underwater, he couldn't use potions. So, gritting his teeth, he wrapped himself fully in the barrier and made for the surface.\nTHWANG THWANG!\nAcid blobs slammed around him, missing by inches. The Kraken had sensed weakness—it was relentless now.\nAustin didn't scream. He didn't roar back. He just swam. Focused. Calm.\nSPLASH!\nHe broke the surface, gasping for air, chest heaving. But there was no time to rest. The Kraken was still below.\n'It's strong in the water... and it won't come out, no matter what I do,' Austin thought. But he had a plan.\n'Mirage Sync.'\nIn a flash, another Austin appeared beside him. Silent and prepared. Without a word, the clone ran straight toward the water.\nMeanwhile, the real Austin looked up and chanted—once, twice, three times—barriers layered like floating stairs, rising higher into the sky.\nHis clone followed, diving into the deep again.\nUnderwater, the Kraken's red eyes locked onto the false Austin. The bait worked.\nThe clone summoned the Shard and charged. SLASH! It cut another tentacle clean off.\nThe Kraken roared again, louder this time. It fired an acid bomb.\nBOOM!\nIt struck the clone head-on. Flesh tore. A leg vanished. But the clone didn't scream. It just kept swimming up.\nThe monster grinned—finally, its prey was dying.\nBut something felt wrong. The injured Austin didn't flinch. Didn't scream. Didn't slow down.\nThe Kraken's eyes narrowed. It lunged forward, mouth wide, eager to devour its helpless prey—\nBut just as its jaws snapped shut—\nPSSHHH\nThe fake Austin vanished into mist.\nThe Kraken's eyes went wide.\nToo late.\nBOOOOOOM\nSomething dropped from the sky—a blur of force and fury.\nCRAAACK!\nAustin landed on the Kraken's head like a comet, his Shard glowing with the power of Kinetic Discharge and Berserk.\nThe impact was devastating—its slimy skull burst apart like a cracked egg.\nAustin didn't stop.\nHe tore through the monster, bursting out of its other side in a fountain of blood and gore.\nThe sea turned dark with ink and death.\nAnd the Kraken...was no more.\nAustin floated in the crimson-tinted water, chest rising and falling as the sunlight broke through the waves above.\n[Ding!]\n[You have conquered the fourth dungeon!]\n[+5000 EXP!]\n[Current EXP: 7296]\n\"…Five thousand points,\" he muttered with a tired grin, blood dripping from his cheek.\nHe looked down at the fading corpse below, then up at the still sky.\n\"One down,\" he whispered, eyes sharpening. \"Plenty more waiting.\"\nAnd with that, he kicked forward toward the next battle.\n°°°°°°°°°\n[Dungeon: Sixth]\n[Pre-mid boss stage]\nThe cold bit into Austin's skin, snow swirling around him like a living storm. Frost clung to his brows. Ahead, twenty hulking ice bears, their white fur dusted with blue, growled in unison—their glowing eyes locked on him.\nAustin cracked his neck and raised God's Wrath, the twin war hammers pulsing with faint golden light. His breath turned to mist as he whispered,\n\"Come on, then.\"\nThe first bear roared and charged.\nBOOOOM!\nAustin slammed one hammer into the ground—an explosive shockwave tore through the snow, hurling the bear back like a ragdoll. The ground cracked beneath his feet.\nTwo more came from the sides, flanking him.\nAustin spun.\nCRACK—THWAM!\nHe bashed the left one with his hammer, its skull denting before it was launched into a nearby frozen tree. With the other, he twisted and hurled the second hammer at the beast on the right.\nTHUD\nThe bear's head snapped sideways as the hammer struck with enough force to shatter ice.\nAustin raised his hand, and the hammer flew back into his grip with a golden streak.\nThe rest of the pack growled louder—ten of them charged as one.\n\"Alright,\" he muttered, narrowing his eyes. \"Let's shake the earth.\"\nHe jumped.\nHigh.\nAnd as he came down, both hammers above his head, golden sparks danced across the sky.\nBAAAAAAM!!\nHe slammed them into the ground. A colossal shockwave erupted, cracking the icy floor and sending bears flying in every direction—limbs flailing, snow bursting like thunder.\nOne tried to crawl away.\nAustin walked toward it, dragging one hammer behind him. His breath slowed. His eyes are calm.\nWith one clean swing—\nCRUNCH.\nSilence returned to the dungeon, broken only by falling snow.\nAustin heaved a sigh as he finished all twenty mobs within a few minutes.\nHe looked far ahead, and a huge beast of about fifteen feet, huge feet and long arms was waiting for him.\nIt looked like a yeti, but not those friendly ones. Those eyes clearly radiated a sharp lust for blood.\n'I think I should take a break...' Austin sat down on the snow, and instantly, a resting zone appeared around him.\nCurling his knees, he asked the system, 'Show me my stats.'\n[Ding!]\n[Combat: 99/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Romance: 79/100]\n{Next reward at 80}\n[Durability: 99/100]\n{Next reward at 100}\n[Trickery: 49/50]\n{Next reward at 50}\n[Overall Progression: 99/100]\n[Next Reward at 100]\nAustin hummed in surprise, \"I am so close, eh? How come?\"\n[Ding!]\n[Your romance stat progressed when you reunited with your beloved.]\n[Your trickery stat was boosted when you tricked the whole demonic army.]\n[Your combat stats were affected by the usage of Scar and your battle in the dungeons.]\nAustin hummed, understandable.\n\"So...will I ascend to the next stage after defeating this one?\" He asked while pointing at the yeti.\n[Most likely, host.]\nAustin hummed again as he summoned a few potions and some food from the inventory.\nIt has been a few hours since he was summoned here, and he has already progressed a lot. He was in a haste since he wanted to save the love of his life, but going out like this meant not only would he fail to save her, but he would be killed too.\nAnd Austin can't lose his life...at least not until he saves Valerie.\nThat's why he was going to take his time and slowly prepare his body to absorb the third fragment. So, once he gets out of the dungeon, he could end that bug once and for all.\nThe system commends the Host's dedication. *Cheering*]\nAustin chuckled as he slowly chewed the chips and thought of a strategy to defeat his next opponent.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "KHIEEEEEEK!\nA deafening screech tore through the air as the giant scorpion stood its ground, its one remaining eye scanning the dunes with frantic, jerking motions.\nGreenish-black blood oozed from deep wounds carved into its thick carapace. Its left claw had been cleanly severed, and a glowing blue dagger was still lodged in the socket where its other eye had once been.\nThe beast was injured, enraged, and trembling with fear.\nIt wasn't just fighting—it was surviving.\nTING.\nA sharp sound rang from above.\nThe scorpion snapped its tail upward in a flash, trying to block whatever was coming.\nDHAK!\nSomething slammed into the tail—a faint impact, not enough to break through its armor. It had blocked it, yes.\nBut it was the wrong threat.\n\"Peek-a-boo~\"\nThe voice came from beneath.\nBefore the monster could turn, Austin rose from the sand like a ghost, his body caked in dust and hidden by the terrain.\nIts eyes widened in alarm—too late.\nIn his hand, a strange, pulsing device lit up.\nSHCFOOO!\nA white-hot beam shot from the tool, blasting through the scorpion's chest and punching a hole straight through its body.\nKHIEEEEEEK!!\nThe beast shrieked in agony, flailing wildly as it staggered forward, desperate and disoriented.\nAustin stepped fully out of the sand and calmly dusted off his coat.\n\"Man... you're one tenacious bastard.\"\nHis eyes narrowed as he looked at the creature, once proud, now broken.\nThe final boss of the sixth dungeon still hadn't fallen, but it was close.\nHe'd been fighting it for nearly two hours—dodging, striking, hiding, and healing with potions in between.\nUnlike him, the monster wasn't recovering.\nAnd it showed.\nThe beast didn't fall.\nInstead, it roared one last time—KHIEEEEEEK!—and lunged forward in a final burst of rage. Its legs stabbed into the sand, and its long, jagged tail arched high, trembling with venom.\nThen it struck.\nWHOOSH!\nThe tail came down like a thunderbolt, aimed straight at Austin's heart.\nBut Austin didn't move an inch.\nFWOOM.\nA transparent dome of crackling energy burst to life around him—Absolute Barrier—the monster's tail slammed into it with a deafening BOOM, sending a shockwave rippling through the air.\nSparks danced across the barrier's surface. Cracks formed... but it held.\nThe scorpion reeled back, dazed for half a second.\nThat was all Austin needed.\nHe dropped the barrier—and vanished in a blur of motion, Berserk pulsing through his veins.\nIn the blink of an eye, he was above the monster's head, descending like a meteor.\nThe scorpion sensed danger and tried to retreat.\nBut Austin was ready.\nTWING!\nA barrier flared to life behind the creature, cutting off its escape.\nTrapped.\nWith both hands locked together, Austin came crashing down like a hammer.\nBOOOOM!\nThe strike hit with devastating force, enhanced by Kinetic Surge. The monster's head slammed into the sand with a sickening crunch, a crater forming beneath it. Dust exploded outward. The scorpion's shell cracked. Its limbs twitched.\nAustin landed on its head, calm, steady.\nFrom his side, he drew a gleaming golden weapon.\nThe Helio Cannon.\nSunlight shimmered across its smooth frame, the core already glowing hot with absorbed power. A weapon forged to channel sunlight into devastating blasts—a perfect counter to creatures of the dark.\nDemons, to be precise.\nHe pointed the cannon at the back of the monster's skull.\nThe gun hummed, the light inside pulsing brighter and brighter until it looked like it would burst.\nAustin bid his farewell,\n\"Nice fighting you.\"\nSHKOOOOOOM!!\nA blazing solar beam erupted from the cannon, blasting through the creature's skull and lighting up the battlefield in golden fire. The sand turned to glass beneath the heat. The scorpion didn't even have time to scream.\nSilence followed.\nOnly the soft crackle of heat lingered in the air… and Austin, standing atop the smoking corpse of the dungeon's final boss.\nAustin heaved a sigh as he stored the gun in his inventory and looked at the system screen,\n[Congratulations, host!]\n[You have conquered the sixth dungeon!]\n[You have gained 25000 EXP!]\n[Total EXP: 51028]\nAustin frowned upon seeing the system screen and completely ignored her.\nAfter a pause, the system sent another text,\n[Are you still mad at me?]\nAustin scoffed, \"You lied to me.\"\nA few days ago, when Austin defeated the mid boss of the fifth dungeon, he broke through the first stage of the system by reaching the limits of every progression.\nHis dedication to save Valerie, the Trickery he used to fool the Yeti, and the strength he showed...everything was hefty enough to push him beyond the limits.\nAnd...he was expecting something amazing once he overcame the first stage\nBut all he got was ...removal of the stats altogether and only the option of <Dungeon>, <Quest>, and <Shop> left.\nIt was such a letdown that he had been ignoring the system for some time now.\n[But, host, you have already reached the stage where you don't need to look at the system screen. You are inches away from breaking into S-rank. Without knowing, you have progressed-]\n\"Yeah, I know. Stop flattering me.\" Austin could tell that he had walked through a long path in the past one and a half months.\nOther than his beard and hair, his stats have grown exponentially because he never stopped fighting.\nWhenever he delayed finishing a boss, the system summoned the mobs once again, so he continued to gain experience and strength through every battle.\n[Can I do something to get your forgiveness?]\nAgain, in that little sister voice, she asked.\nAustin was vulnerable towards cute things, so he just crossed his arms and told her, \"If only you provide me at least a health and mana bar, then I might forgive you.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Command accepted!]\n[Once the host absorbs the third fragment, the system would install a Health Bar and a Magic Bar.]\nAustin heaved a sigh, thinking if he was too easy.\nRegardless, he didn't remain stuck in one place and got ready to start the ritual.\n\"System… are you sure I'm ready?\" Austin asked, his voice quiet, laced with a hint of nervousness.\nEverything he had done until now-the endless training, the countless hours of pain—had led to this moment. All for one purpose: to absorb the third fragment of his soul. To grow stronger. Strong enough to save Valerie. Strong enough to crush that insect who dared to harm the people close to him.\nHe had no backup plan. No safety net. If this failed… he would still fight, still run to save her—but the chances of everything falling into place would drop. And that terrified him.\n[Don't be pessimistic, host. You've overcome too much to doubt yourself now. Your soul is ready. And your body… it will accept the third fragment without resistance.]\nAustin exhaled long and deeply. \"Haah… I hope you're right.\"\nHe stepped into the resting zone, letting its calming aura settle over him like a blanket.\nThen, with steady hands, he raised the Shard and sliced his thumb. A sharp sting, followed by a thin line of blood.\nAs the crimson drop formed, he held the dagger beneath it, letting the blood fall onto its blade.\n\"With the command of the one who sealed you,\" he whispered, \"I call you back to your rightful owner.\"\nIt was a simple command, just as Selner had taught him. His soul fragments only needed a sign—a confirmation that he was truly the one. And his blood carried that proof.\nHe stood still, barely breathing, his heart pounding in his chest. Doubt crept in.\nWhat if it didn't work?\nWhat if—\nThen it happened.\nA faint shimmer appeared before him. A piece of something long lost.\nA broken puzzle piece floated in the air, glowing with a soft, bluish light.\nAustin's eyes softened.\n\"There you are,\" he said quietly. \"Come.\"\nThe fragment shot forward without hesitation, slamming into his chest.\nAustin gasped.\nHis knees gave out, and he dropped to the ground, vision swimming.\nIt felt like a tidal wave crashing into his soul—power so vast, so ancient, it drowned his thoughts.\nThis wasn't like the Parasite King. No… it was something far deeper. Far more overwhelming. Like staring into the eyes of a god and realizing how small you truly are.\nHis throat dried. His breathing grew shallow.\nHis body shook violently as it struggled to contain the surge. Muscles ripped and mended in rapid bursts. Bones groaned under pressure. His heart thudded like it might give out at any moment.\nHis mind flickered, barely holding on.\n[Alert!]\n[Host is losing consciousness!]\nHe saw the warning. But it felt distant. Like it was meant for someone else.\nHis limbs were heavy. His thoughts blurred.\nAnd then—darkness.\nAustin collapsed, the world fading into silence as he lost consciousness, his body still glowing faintly where the fragment had entered.\n...\n..\n.\n\"Ah!\" And suddenly, he was awake.\nHis head was still ringing slightly, but he was awake and could see properly.\nHowever, what caught his eyes...completely took him off guard.\nAustin wasn't in a dungeon.\nHe was in a room...a familiar one.\nIt was the same room in which he used to live before he left for the academy.\n\"You are here,\" He heard a voice, and instantly spun on his feet toward the source of the voice.\nThere sat a person who looked exactly like him.\nWith his arms crossed and a calm expression on his face, he said, \"Well, I didn't want to show you all this, but I guess it's important for you.\"\nAnd with that, Austin was shown a past which he never lived.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "A/N: In this chapter, those from the past will have their dialogues in […], while Austin, who is\nwatching the memories, will speak in \"…\".\nHappy reading.\n-------**-------\nAustin Eryndor. A prodigy. A genius. Someone who was born to outshine everyone around him.\nHe awakened his Shard when he was just three years old. By five, he was already defeating sword masters. When his father saw that, he knew his son wasn't just gifted. He was looking at the future king.\nBut Austin never cared about ruling a kingdom.\nIt wasn't because he thought he couldn't do it—he knew he could. He just didn't want to. Sitting on a throne and giving orders didn't excite him. It felt… empty.\n[Austin, you should focus more on your studies. Your father has already chosen you to be the crowned prince.]\nThat was what his mother, Sophie, told him one day when he was seven.\nAustin barely studied, yet he always passed every test with ease. He only showed up for exams when he had no choice. But that kind of attitude didn't sit well with the responsibilities of a future king.\nThat's why his mother tried to push him to make him someone the kingdom could rely on.\nBut still, he answered her with a quiet fire:\n[I can't just sit on a throne and order people around like Father. It's too tedious.]\n[Austin, you shouldn't speak of your father like that.] Sophie scolded gently, and she wasn't wrong. A king who didn't lead or make decisions could bring down an entire nation.\nWatching the memory unfold, the present-day Austin stood in silence. Then, his past self, just a little older than in the memory, spoke beside him.\n\"You saw that? I was so full of myself,\" he said with a sad smile. His voice trembled slightly.\n\"Back then, I only felt alive when I had something to fight for. That's why I kept pushing, kept challenging everyone, even when I didn't need to. I wasn't trying to win—I just didn't want to feel empty.\"\nThose words carried guilt. A heavy, lingering guilt that Austin now began to understand.\nThe scene shifted.\nAustin's eyes widened. A man lay on the ground—familiar, too familiar. His past self stood above him, his Shard held loosely at his side.\n\"Sebas…\" Austin whispered. His voice trembled, a mix of grief and anger weaving through every syllable.\nSebastian, the man who had been like a father to him, groaned in pain on the ground, hurt, broken. And the one who had done it... was him.\n[You're weak, Sebastian. I no longer need your protection. You'd only slow me down. Just retire… and spend your last days with your family or something.]\nHis younger self's voice was cold. Distant. Like Sebastian meant nothing.\nAustin's fists clenched. Hard.\nHe wanted to scream, to strike the arrogant boy he once was. But he couldn't. He couldn't touch the past.\nHe couldn't even kneel beside Sebastian and offer comfort.\n\"Power is a very... dangerous thing,\" his other self murmured beside him. This time, the words came with sorrow.\n\"It makes you feel like everyone below you isn't worth seeing.\"\nAt least… he regretted it now. That mattered.\nBut before Austin could say anything, the scene began to change again.\n\"Speaking of not seeing…\" the other Austin said softly.\nAnd then—\nAustin's heart skipped a beat.\nThere she stood. A young girl with violet eyes. Valerie. So much younger, with a nervous smile tugging at her lips.\nShe was holding something in her hands, fidgeting, hoping.\nHis younger self didn't even glance at her. He just kept reading a book, completely absorbed, as if she wasn't even there.\nFinally, after mustering all her courage, she stepped forward.\n[Umm… w-will you accept this? I made it myself…]\nShe held out a red scarf. Its threads were uneven, slightly loose at the edges—but it was made with care, with love. The same red scarf she'd given him in this life on his eighteenth birthday.\nYoung Austin looked at it briefly, took it without a word, and turned to lie on the other side of the bench.\nThat was it.\nNo smile. No thanks. No acknowledgment.\nValerie stayed there, arms shyly tucked behind her back, waiting, hoping.\nMaybe he'd say something. Maybe he'd look at her, just once.\nBut…he…didn't.\nNot…even…a…glance.\nHe knew she was there… and he chose to look away.\n\"I ignored her since she was not a challenge for me. The only reason Austin agreed to get engaged to Valerie was that she was silent and shy. She didn't disturb him unless it was necessary…and that's the sole reason he was engaged to her.\"\nAustin turned to his other self before asking, \"How can you even live a life like that? Not respecting those who love him, ignoring those who care for him…not respecting even his parents. I mean, was he mentally challenged?\"\nAustin knew he was being impulsive, but it felt so wrong and annoying seeing his different version like that.\nThe other Austin held his head low as he said, \"That's the reason why I broke my soul into different fragments and asked the Witch to send it to a different body. I believed the lack of power might help you realise the importance of relationships more.\"\nAustin was still quite displeased but didn't speak anything further.\nThe scene before their eyes shifted again, and this time, it was the scene of the war.\nThe demonic forces were advancing through the Sea of Separation, and on the side of humanity, only a single soldier stood.\nWith his sword planted into the ground, he sat on the wooden chair calmly as if he weren't inches away from facing an army of thousands.\nHowever, he showed no fear or panic.\nThere was no support or a second plan. He himself was every plan humanity needed.\nThe first monster reached him and turned into dust.\nAnd second, third, and seventeenth.\nThose who tried trespassing from the other side, too, were consumed.\n\"W-What is that skill?\" Austin was flabbergasted. The other version of him was still sitting there motionlessly, a bored expression never leaving his face, yet the army was vanishing as if they were being transported into a different realm using invisible portals.\nThe other Austin told him, \"It's one of the abilities of Scar—Scourge.\" He further explained, \"Those beings who are considerably weaker than me get consumed just by drawing closer. I don't need to move and just wait for the stronger ones to show up.\"\nCrossing his arms, he added, \"I created this skill based on my requirement. Fighting fodders has always been a bother.\"\n\"But that's what gives you experience...\" Austin rebuked, but then...he realised it was he who required strength, which forced him to hunt even weak monsters again and again to gain more EXP.\nThe other Austin smiled faintly as he said, \"As I said before, you are the version of me that I desired to be. Because you...are the only one who knows the value of strength and connections.\"\nAustin closed his mouth, his shoulders losing strength.\nHis vision again shifted, and this time, they were in the middle of a desolate land. Austin, who was older than in the previous vision, was kneeling on the ground.\n\"This was me who was about to die. I finally met my match, and after nearly defeating Astaroth, I was losing my life at a fast pace.\" The other one informed.\nAnd just as he said, the older Austin was gasping and clutching his heart, while looking in extreme pain. This was the first time Austin saw his other self showing any emotions so vividly.\nAustin saw Selner and another woman who looked similar to her performing some ritual that divided his soul into four fragments.\nAustin lay down on the ground, his eyes closing slowly.\nSelner knelt before him, resting his head on her lap, as she said,\n[...is this how we say goodbye?]\nAustin smiled, [Sorry...I wasn't able to give you much time...]\n[Here...take this...I...have nothing else to give you in these final moments.]\nHe suddenly pulled out the same red scarf that Valerie gave him, urging Austin to ask,\n\"Why is he giving it to her?\" He was genuinely baffled. And why wasn't Valerie here in his last moments?\nThe other Austin was slightly hesitant, but he revealed anyway, \"I...actually married Selner...not Valerie.\"\n\"...\" Austin was stunned.\n...he cheated on Valerie?\nThe other Austin sighed, \"Well, I know what you must be feeling, but in my story, Valerie always remained an admirer and I always remained distant from her. So we never had a-\"\n\"She deserved love. You are a bastard.\" Austin passed the judgment.\nThe memory fragment stopped defending himself and changed the topic, \"Now...you know most of the things and have a better idea how you should tread in this war. Once you get the fourth fragment, you will be able to command Scar to its full potential.\"\nWith his voice turning serious, he added, \"Remember Austin...don't make the same mistake as me. You aren't alone in this...so make sure to ask for help.\"\nAustin, the real one, scoffed, \"I am not a prick, so I definitely won't hesitate from relying on others.\"\nThe memory fragment gave a smile, as he said his final words, \"I believe in you...now, go. She is waiting for you.\"\nSlowly, his vision shifted and Austin found himself back in the dungeon.\nHis eyes glowed faintly, as he commanded without delay, \"System...\"\n[Ding!]\n[Ending the Trials!]\n[Best of luck, host!]\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Play the boss music.

      "content": "A moment.\nThat was all he had.\nA moment.\nAustin's eyes snapped open.\nThe real world came rushing back—the claws of Rudolph just inches from his chest, ready to tear through his heart.\nHis pulse thundered, yet his face remained calm. No fear. No panic.\nMaybe it was the afterglow of his level-up. Maybe he was still halfway out of the dungeon. But to him, everything moved in slow motion—like time itself had been dragged through tar.\nWith a flick of his hand, he summoned Scar. The weapon answered with a low hum, its edges glowing from the Soul Energy he fed it, glowing, and starving for more.\nAustin twisted his body and spun aside, the claws missing him by a breath.\n\"W-What—?\" Rudolph's possessed body gasped, crashing into a tree with a sickening crack.\nAustin didn't waste a second. He didn't finish Rudolph off. Not yet.\nHis eyes shot to the battlefield—toward the horde of demons closing in on Parkinson and Rhea.\nValerie.\nHe saw her alive.\nChest rising and falling. Fingers twitching.\nAlive.\nThat was enough.\nHe raised Scar to his lips.\nHis eyes gleamed—not with hope, but with a wild, feral hunger. Bloodlust surged off him like heat from fire. The air around him seemed to freeze.\nEveryone—friend and foe—stopped.\nAustin's body vanished into black mist.\nOne blink.\nA moment ago, he was far across the battlefield.\nThe next—\n\"Huh…?\" Rhea's voice trembled.\nAustin knelt beside her.\nHe held Valerie in his arms, gently lifting her upper body, checking her breath, her pulse.\n\"R-Rhea…\" Parkinson's voice cracked behind her.\nShe turned.\nAnd froze.\nWhat lay before them sent ice down her spine.\nSilence.\nNothing moved.\nThe battlefield was empty.\nMore than two dozen demonic soldiers were gone. Not fallen. Not burned.\nGone.\nOnly bones remained—upright, frozen in the same poses they'd held just seconds ago.\nAs if something had ripped the life from their bodies but left the proof behind.\nThe bones... still standing.\n\"...what is this?\" Parkinson couldn't believe his eyes as he turned toward Austin.\nThat blade ..he knew there was something unusual about it, however, until now, Austin could barely use its power. However, now, it felt as if he had become the true master of overwhelming strength.\n\"...is he the same person I knew?\" The boy muttered under his breath as Austin fed a red potion to his lover, and the green veins on Valerie's neck started to disappear\nHer complexion improved, and she exhaled a long breath.\n\"Aaah...*cough* *cough*\" She coughed violently, her face turning red slightly as Austin rubbed her back to help her calm down.\nMeanwhile, Rhea and Parkinson were keeping guard around them; however, it wasn't necessary.\nEvery being who drew closer was turning into nothing but a set of bones, and within seconds, a whole crowd of standing skeletons surrounded them\n\"What is this...\" Rhea couldn't help but feel helpless. She couldn't believe what she was witnessing. No Shard could be capable of something like this...\n\"...this doesn't make sense.\" Parkinson was in the same boat. Nothing was making sense.\n\"Are you okay?\" Austin asked softly, barely above a whisper, as if his voice might further hurt her.\nValerie opened her eyes, and the face she saw made her feel better already.\n\"Y-Yeah...I am fine...\" Her voice was rough, as if he had screamed for too long. However, she wanted to speak...to call out his name...to talk to him.\nIt feels as if she has been detached from him...years of loneliness, or maybe the very feeling of getting separated from him made her feel like this.\nShe was desperate. She needed him.\nAustin cupped her cheek, \"Please don't cry...Otherwise, I will cry too.\" It was the months of separation and the thought of losing everything that seeing her cry made his eyes moist, too.\nHe leaned forward and pressed his forehead against her, \"You are safe, Valerie. I won't let anything happen to you now.\"\n\"...please...I don't want to die...I want to live with you...\" She clung to him, even though her hold was weak. She was desperately holding him with her life, feeling her chest tighten.\nNeither of them could relay how they were feeling at the moment.\nStress, relief, elation...every sensation has just intensified and was clouding their minds.\nHowever, amidst the chaos, they knew one thing that allowed them to calm down.\nThey still have each other. Valerie was alive, and Austin was safe.\nAnd that's what mattered the most.\n\"You have gained control over Scar. I am...shocked.\" A voice echoed through the forest. A voice Austin was quite familiar with.\nThe being was the reason why Austin lost two dearest people to him, and was about to lose the closest being to him...\n\"Val, can you wait for me for a bit?\" Austin asked, his voice doesn't signify any panic or concern. As if he were asking for a moment to finish a trivial task.\nHer hold around his arm turned slightly firmer, as she said, \"....please...return to me...I beg you...\" Her big eyes were filled with tears, and her shoulders trembled.\nAustin gave her hand an assuring squeeze and told her, \"Nothing in the world can stop me from coming back to you. It's just a matter of a few seconds. Trust me, love.\"\nHe gave her a soft kiss on her forehead.\nHe looked at Rhea and asked her, \"Can you be here with her?\"\nThe pinkhead was still quite shaken up with all the development, but she didn't delay in nodding in assent and kneeling beside Austin.\n\"Can you defeat him?\" Rhea asked quietly, a tinge of concern in her eyes.\nAustin had a firm look as he said, \"Nothing can save him now.\"\nHe got up and turned towards the being—the Parasite King in his real form.\nAbout fifty days ago, when Sebastian was killed before him, Austin wasn't able to look at him.\nBut now, he was looking in those red eyes with no sense of discomfort.\nWith his hands behind his back, Austin said, \"You know you can't win this battle.\"\nThe Parasite King chuckled, \"That...yes. I won't be able to defeat the current you...but this war. I am already on the verge of winning it.\"\nWith a sudden rush of confidence, he said, \"My forces have infiltrated your security, and they are rushing toward the human settlements.\"\nWith his eyes narrowing, the inhumane creature spat, \"Now you can do nothing but watch your loved ones, your brethren, die like insects! You won't save anyone! Just like how you can't save your friend and servant! Khahaha!\"\nHe seems to be having fun. Good for him.\n\"Is that so?\" Austin spoke in a nonchalant tone, and suddenly, his figure blurred.\nThe Parasite King didn't have the chance to dodge as suddenly his neck was held and Austin jumped into the air.\n*BOOOOOM*\nThe sound barrier broke at the propulsion as Austin launched toward Eryndor, and just as his figure reached the height of the clouds, he summoned an Absolute Barrier beneath his feet.\nHe turned the Parasite King towards the demonic forces, more than seven hundred of them, which were a few miles away from the capital.\n\"Now, look carefully.\" The Parasite King was trying to break free, but his eyes were on his army.\n\"Ah!\" His eyes widened as suddenly, a huge greenish barrier stopped the march of the demons, bringing a sudden halt to the stampede.\nNot only the front wall, but the whole army was surrounded by barriers, leaving only their head in the clear sky.\n\"You know how it feels to die slowly, right? I have killed you once before, just like that.\" Austin grinned as he held Scar above his head and drew a faint circle which became mist instantly.\nAustin didn't have to direct it before the mist advanced towards the demonic army.\nThe Parasite King's eyes widened...that cloud...the rain of death...he has felt it.\nHe has the memories of a version of him being dragged into a pitfall and for three long days, getting his body burned under the same dark clouds.\n\"Y-You...you can't do this!\" The aura of the demon flared as he extended his sharp claws towards Austin.\nHowever, the claw could be found descending back to the ground as soon as it was raised.\nThe Parasite King knew it was fruitless to attack the being beside him who had even brought the Demon King to his knees...however, he couldn't just stand there and see his army getting sacrificed!\n\"I-I will swear an alliance to you! Just spare my life. I will take a vow to stand on your side!\" He begged.\nAustin's grin disappeared. Unknowingly, his eyes held the same coldness as the other versions he used to have.\nBringing the being closer, Austin told him in a dangerously low tone, \"If you had offered me your loyalty before killing those two...Then I might have thought. But now...\"\nAustin held the two horns on his head and started to tear the Parasite King from the middle.\nThe Demon General couldn't do anything since every attack targeted at Austin was intercepted by the blade was remained hanging beside him.\nIn the face of his death, all the General could do was curse, \"You will lose everyone...that's your destiny...that power will consume everything...\"\nAustin didn't pause and tore the Parasite King from the middle, as if he were nothing but a piece of paper.\nBlood and innards dropped to the ground as Austin stood there while holding the torn body of the Parasite Chief.\nHe looked back at the coast...there were still quite many demons, but since S-ranks were dealing with them,\n\"I would rather spend my time with my Val.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- And the arc concludes here.

      "content": "The situation at the border was finally brought under control, thanks to the efforts of the three S-rank warriors and the soldiers on the ground.\nThough the cost was high, especially from the relentless attacks by aerial monsters, they managed to bring down all the demons by the third day.\nWhen word came that nearly five hundred demons marching toward Eryndor had been wiped out, everyone assumed it was Valerie who had dealt with the Parasite King and his army.\nIt sounded almost impossible for one person to crush such a massive force—but Valerie was an S-rank. Perhaps she had finally used the trump card she'd been keeping hidden all this time.\nBut when Rhea and the surviving soldiers near the fort shared what they had witnessed, the entire army was shaken.\nThe truth spread fast across cities, across borders. Every Emperor, every Council Head heard the same unbelievable report.\nAnd no matter how hard they tried to deny it or turn away from it, they couldn't change the fact staring them in the face.\nThe one who killed the Parasite King—one of the feared Four Generals—was not Valerie.\nIt was Austin.\nThe failed Prince of Eryndor had done the impossible.\nHe had slain the Parasite King.\n------**------\nAustin brought Valerie to Eryndor and took her to the palace instantly.\nThis was the safest place he could think of, that's why he didn't delay.\nFor the past thirty-six hours, he has been with Valerie constantly.\nAlthough she survived because of the Elixir, the exhaustion of constantly using the S-rank ability has kept her unconscious most of the time.\nTo ensure that she doesn't lack energy while recovering, a few top graded healers have been checking her time to time.\nHer complexion was better now, and she was breathing evenly.\nAustin sat there with a sense of relief on his face.\nValerie was safe. The system was right…he saved her. All the hard work paid off. Valerie didn't leave him…and that was worth all the efforts he put.\nSuddenly, the door slowly parted and revealed a familiar face.\nCedric silently stepped inside and asked in a low tone, \"How is she now?\"\nAustin exhaled a quiet sigh, \"Doing better…probably will wake up today or tomorrow.\"\nCedric hummed, \"That's good news.\"\nCedric stood beside his son and remained silent for a few moments before informing him, \"Idris has returned today…he wanted to meet you, but considering your condition, he refrained.\"\nAustin remained silent, but he was thankful that he didn't come. He…really didn't want to talk right now.\nCedric exactly knew why, even though Valerie had recovered, Austin seemed so sad and disheartened.\nResting his hand on his son's shoulder, he said, \"I never told him to serve you…it was Sebas who came to me one day and showed me your training early in the morning. A day ago, your wrist got dislocated yet you were training the next day.\"\nAustin bit his lip…he remembered that.\nCedric further added, \"That day…he told me that he desires to serve you…because he saw something which I…and your mother failed to notice.\" Giving his shoulder a gentle squeeze, he said, \"He saw the real you and he wished to see where you stand at the end of the path.\"\nTears streamed down his face as Austin clenched his fists and choked out a few words, \"B-But he didn't wait to see me…when I shone the brightest…he left me…betrayed me…\"\n\"My son…\" Cedric hugged Austin, and finally, after so many days, Austin cried.\nHis tears were endless. All the grief, frustration…regret…everything welled up all of a sudden.\nAlthough he showed a bold front before the demons, inwardly, he was shattered by losing his guardian and a close friend.\nHe failed to protect them…failed to fulfill his duty.\nThat day, Austin, for the first time, felt it.\nThe sense of loss.\n------**-----\n\"Why didn't you come inside?\" Cedric asked softly as he stepped out of the room.\nSophie stood by the wall, her eyes red and watery.\nShe wiped away her tears and shook her head. \"He's already hurting so much… I didn't want to bring up memories that might make it worse.\"\nCedric looked at his wife, his expression firm yet gentle.\n\"You need to be with him, Sophie. He needs you—he needs us. If you keep standing on the outside, we may never be able to help him heal.\"\nHis words hit her like a wave. Sophie felt her chest tighten, her breath caught in her throat.\nCedric didn't wait for a reply. He turned and walked away, leaving her in silence.\nSlowly, Sophie stepped closer to the door. She peeked inside and saw her son asleep in the chair, his shoulders slumped, as if even his dreams were heavy.\nHer heart ached.\n'Am I really allowed to hold you close… to tell you everything will be okay…'\n------**-----\n\"Hey...you okay?\" Morkel slowly approached Rhea with a cup of coffee in his hand.\nShe woke up a few minutes ago and was sitting by the window in a daze.\nMorkel had arrived at the Capital as soon as he heard the news.\nRudolph's death was quite shocking for him as well. Rudolph was quite close to him, even though they had a sense of rivalry.\nBecause of their common interest in Rhea, they had become good friends.\nAnd if he could feel so sad, he couldn't even begin to think how Rhea, the one who was closest to Rudolph, must be feeling at the moment.\nHe has seen how, since day one, they have been close. The only girl who didn't run away from Rudolph was the first guy who, despite being a noble, never discriminated against her.\nRhea's eyes were red. It was apparent that she had cried a lot.\nWith her brows drawing closer, she asked, \"I told him...to not leave his post...under the protection of so many strong warriors...he might have survived.\"\nHe was an idiot...coming after her...trying to protect her. She would have survived...and even if she had died, she wouldn't have blamed him. But now, Rhea was blaming herself that he was no longer with her.\nShe was breaking...inch by inch, by the memory of seeing him dying before her eyes, but all she did was to stare at him...powerless...helpless.\nShe couldn't stop thinking about what could have happened...if she had done this...or that...but now, nothing but regrets remains.\nRudolph was gone. He wasn't going to come back now.\n...not going to return and hear her response to his confession.\nMorkel knelt beside the girl and took her hand in his.\nHis eyes were drawn to the ground as he said, \"We always think of 'what if' Rhea...but it is a fact that we can't change what has already happened. I know it will take some time for you to recover, but remember one thing...Rudolph would have never wanted you to cry like this. Everything he did was to keep you happy. So please...don't take any rash step and don't blame yourself for what happened.\"\nThe older one didn't remain there for long, and after resting the cup on the table, he left the room.\n°°°°°°°°\n\"Mm...\" Valerie stirred, her consciousness returning as she weakly opened her eyes.\nThe first person she saw upon waking up...was her father.\n\"Dad...\" She called out.\nAdam gently smiled as he said, \"You are awake. It's a relief.\" He helped his daughter to adjust the pillow as he heard her asking,\n\"Where is he...?\"\nAdam would be a fool not to know whom she was asking about.\nAdam sighed, \"Attending the funeral ceremony...\"\nValerie's chest tightened as she bit her lips.\nSebastian and Rudolph...two close beings to him. He loved Sebastian as a father and had a strong bond with Rudolph as a brother.\nAnd he...lost both of them.\n'...I wish to be with you now...' but she was still too weak to even remain conscious. Going there would only make him more worried.\n'My Lord...please return to me... I don't want you to suffer alone...'\n....\nAustin was standing there before the tombstones.\nOn the left was Sebastian's grave, and on the right rested his dear brother Rudolph.\nRhea fell unconscious while crying earlier when she saw Rudolph's body. Rudolph's mother was being treated by the medic, and his father...well, it was the first time for Austin to see the Commander cry.\nSebastian's family also attended the funeral. His wife...and kids...they looked lost. No tears...just stared at his coffin and...left not so long after.\nAustin would visit his family and would make sure Sebastian's absence doesn't affect them...at least, financially.\nHowever, for now...he just wanted to be alone.\nHe wanted to feel this moment and engrave it deep in his mind that he wasn't invincible. He wasn't protected by Lady Luck, nor was this a fictitious story where he would enjoy a happy ending at the end of the day.\nThis was a war...and to make sure that Austin doesn't face something like this again, all he has to do is one thing\nErase the demon race from existence.\n••••••••\nA/N:- Kill em all.",

      "content": "A few days have passed since Austin attended the funeral of the two closest beings to him.\nThe Council, along with Eryndor, has organized the ceremony for the martyrs who sacrificed themselves to protect their people. A total of twelve hundred soldiers died during the war, including the Commander of Ademerg.\nThe families of the sacrificed ones have received compensation, and the damage dealt to the military assets is slowly recovering.\nThe Council Heads have returned to their offices and have resumed their work.\nThere has been some talk about creating a defense line in the Sea of Separation to at least get warned about any wave of demonic beasts that may attack them in the future.\nAfter this war, there were several things that were supposed to change. There was a high chance that strong warriors, regardless of which field they belonged to, would be forced to take the military training so that if a disaster like this strikes again, they could gather a larger number of warriors.\nA meeting has been organized to address the matter, and from Eryndor, not only the King but the 'crowned' Prince was invited as well.\nWell, Austin hasn't thought about it as of now. He was more focused on helping his girl recover.\n\"Say aah~\" Austin urged, and the violet-haired woman shyly parted her small mouth to intake the spoonful of porridge.\nThe porridge had everything she needed for recovery, and it was quite delicious too. Despite all that, she had a look of complaint on her face, which urged Austin to ask, \"What happened? Do you want something else to eat?\"\nValerie shook her head, \"It tastes good…but I wanted to be the first to feed you like that.\" Her voice was so small and adorable that he had to lean toward her to enjoy it to the fullest.\nHaah~ this cuteness, he missed it so much.\n\"Next time, when I fall sick, you can feed me, okay?\"\nValerie hummed as she continued to eat.\nA few spoonfuls were left, and Valerie was already full, which is why Austin decided to finish the rest.\n\"Ah…\" Valerie exclaimed, seeing him eating with the same spoon.\nAustin's brows elevated as he teased, \"We were kissing passionately in the morning, and you feel shy to share the same spoon?\"\nValerie blushed, \"That…and this is different.\" Why did her Lord have to add the word 'passionately'? She couldn't stop thinking about it now…\nAustin finished the porridge and set the bowl aside. Then he slid under the blanket and gently pulled the girl into his arms.\nIt felt warm—so warm—and right in a way he couldn't explain. Holding her close, feeling the softness of her body pressed against his, he was filled with quiet peace. She was here. Safe. And in that moment, it felt like she belonged there, with him, and nowhere else.\n\"I just want to make a home right here inside the blanket and never leave.\"\nValerie nestled in his chest, her eyes half-closed and the corner of her lips curved, as she said, \"Maybe having the same porridge has aligned our thoughts.\" What could be better for her than to always be with the man whom she adores?\nIn those few moments after the parasite bit her, and her consciousness began to fade, the very thought of not being able to see him again killed her from the inside.\nIt was strange…so strange, that the only person whom she could think about in her dying moments was not her parents, not her nanny, not her teacher, even though they all were important people to her.\nThe only thought that kept clouding her mind was 'I won't see him…I want to be with him…he will be sad…I don't want to go…'\nHer hold on his shirt turned firm, and a single tear droplet appeared at the corner of her eye.\n\"Val…?\" Austin, who had been quietly admiring his wife's beauty, was startled when he saw tears in her eyes. Gently, he asked, \"Are you thinking about what happened?\"\nValerie sniffled and let him wipe her tears. \"In those moments… when I couldn't see you, when I thought I might not survive…\" Her voice trembled. \"It broke something in me. And I don't think I can ever forget that moment.\"\nShe looked up at him, eyes searching. \"Were you devastated too…?\"\nAustin froze for a second… then smiled softly. A few moments, she'd said.\nTo her—and to the rest of the world—it had only been seconds when she'd fallen on the battlefield, standing on the edge of death.\nBut for him, it had been fifty long days. Fifty days trapped in that dark dungeon, weighed down by the constant fear that he might not be able to protect her. That everything he was fighting for might end in failure. Those thoughts haunted him, shook him awake at night. And because he couldn't bear the wait, because he was desperate to see her again, he barely stopped fighting.\nAustin just hugged the girl close to him and told her, \"Hear my heart, and you would know what I felt when you nearly left me.\"\nHis heart…it was beating slower than usual. She has counted his heart rate, and this was slower than usual.\nHe fears nothing more than getting separated from the girl he was hugging at the moment.\nAnd now, Austin would make sure that he never goes through the same dread.\nEver again.\n…\nSophie was in the kitchen with a maid, making some cookies for her family members so they could enjoy them with some tea.\nThe Corwon couple were also staying here for the time being, so it would be a good family time.\n\"Take this and you remember everyone's preference, right?\" Sophie asked as she rested the plate full of cookies and other snacks.\nShe has given the list of what drinks Austin, Cedric, Averis, and Valerie prefer. She doesn't know the taste of the Corwon couple, so she told the maid to ask them first.\nThe maid turned towards the lady, a bit nervous, as she asked, \"Umm, my lady, won't you join as well?\" She was nervous about making a mistake when she reached there.\nSophie paused for a moment...the fact is, she should be there, join the table when the lady of the Corwon house and her in-laws were gathering.\nHowever...Sophie knew that if she went there, Austin wouldn't be able to remain comfortable. He might even leave the table upon seeing her.\nThat's why, \"No, you go. Just don't forget what I told you.\" She shook her head and urged her to leave already.\nLeft in the kitchen alone, Sophie rested her hands on the station and looked down.\n...although her husband told her to approach Austin...she couldn't. After going through such a traumatic experience, Valerie was finally healing him. That's why Sophie didn't want to step in and sour his mood.\n\"I am better not seen...\" She sighed and decided to return to her room, but then, she froze.\nThere was someone standing in the kitchen.\nIt was, \"Austin...\" She called out almost reflexively.\n\"Hiding from me because you are guilty...or running away from taking responsibility for your actions?\" He questioned, his tone heavy.\nSophie shook her head, but no word came out of her mouth.\nShe was ready to receive any punishment for what she had done...but the shame of what she had committed doesn't allow her to face him.\nAustin raised his hand and showed her a broken pendant.\n\"Ah...\" Sophie recognized the pendant. She gave it to him before Austin left for Ademerg.\n\"You said that it was a good luck charm...but it was actually a barrier.\"\nLooking up at her, he asked, \"Did you know?\"\nSophie slowly nodded, \"...it once saved me from a wild boar. I didn't tell you because I thought...you won't accept it.\"\nAustin was powerful...and giving him such a trivial gift for his protection might have been rejected...that's why she said it was a good luck charm.\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"It saved my life...so thank you.\"\nWhen the Parasite King attacked him using Rudolph's body, Austin panicked and dropped the Stopwatch he received from Sebastian. He didn't even have the Absolute barrier since he had already used it.\nAt that time, if the barrier hadn't appeared before him...he might have...\nSophie was shocked at the news but...she didn't enquire and just took the broken pendant before saying, \"It fulfilled its duty.\" She was glad she showed courage and gave it to him that day.\nAustin stepped back and said, \"Stop hiding away since I don't loathe you. I can't forget what happened, but because of me, I don't want to see my family incomplete.\"\nLeaving those words, he turned around and left.\nSophie's eyes turned moist as she smiled and, with a nod, spoke to no one, \"Yes...I won't run away anymore.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thank you for reading the book.",

      "content": "\"Tomorrow is Valerie's birthday.\"\nAustin heard his mother-in-law's soft voice as she spoke, and everyone at the table turned toward her.\n\"What should we do?\" she asked, her words gentle, uncertain.\nValerie wasn't here—she had been taken back to rest. Only close family members from both sides, along with Austin, remained at the table.\nAustin hadn't forgotten. He had planned to celebrate the day quietly, just the two of them. Something small and meaningful.\nBut of course, it made sense that her mother would remember too.\n\"Austin… did you remember?\" his father asked with a teasing smile, clearly trying to lighten the mood.\nBut Austin replied without missing a beat. \"I've already prepared a gift for her.\"\nThere was no way he would ever forget a day like that.\nThe world had gained a fine warrior, and he… he had been blessed with an extraordinary wife. On that day, everything changed.\nHe silently offered a word of thanks to Lady Corwon for bringing Valerie into his life.\nThe adults smiled warmly, comforted by the thought that Austin was thoughtful, prepared, and deeply devoted.\n\"So… should we arrange a celebration?\" Cedric asked, looking around the table.\nBut Austin gently shook his head. \"The time isn't right, Father. Not now. Not with everything that's happened. Valerie wouldn't want it either.\"\nNo one wanted to make her smile more than he did. He longed to see her eyes light up, to give her a day that felt full of joy.\nBut now wasn't the time.\nToo many soldiers had been lost. Rudolph—Valerie's childhood friend—and Sebastian, her training partner, her guardian in so many ways—they were both gone.\nPlanning a celebration in the shadow of that grief didn't feel right. Not to him. Not to her.\nHe would still honor her birthday. Quietly, with care. But not with fanfare. Not this year.\n\"He's right. We should keep things in moderation—or it might send the wrong message to the people,\" Adam added, his voice calm but firm.\nWith so many families mourning the loss of loved ones, celebrating openly would feel careless. It could make others believe the royal family had turned a blind eye to their grief.\nThat's why Sophie gently spoke up. \"Then… let's do everything quietly.\"\nAll eyes turned to her, silently asking her to go on.\nEven the Queen looked surprised when she saw that Austin, too, seemed interested in what Sophie had to say.\nStill, she didn't falter. She met their gazes and continued, her voice steady.\n\"We can…\"\n--------**--------\n[A few hours later]\nRhea stood beside the carriage, her eyes lifted toward the sky, though her thoughts were far from it.\nShe was leaving for the academy today.\nThere wasn't really anywhere else she could go—no place that felt right. The academy, even though classes were currently suspended, had agreed to let her stay. At least there, she could try to keep herself occupied.\nBut deep down, she knew the truth.\nThat place will remind me of Rudolph more than anywhere else.\nThe corridors they walked together… the training grounds… the evenings filled with laughter and friendly rivalry—everything would echo with memories of him.\nAnd yet, she chose to go.\nBecause running from those memories wouldn't help.\nAs painful as it would be, she had to face them. She had to carry the weight of that loss, move through it, and find her way forward.\nShe owed him that much.\n\"Returning?\"\nThe voice startled her—she hadn't sensed him approaching.\n\"Oh… Austin.\"\nThe blond prince stood there, calmly stroking the horse's mane.\nAfter a short pause, Rhea nodded and replied, \"Yes. Heading back. The stay here was… really comfortable. But my old room still feels the best.\" She gave a small smile, trying to lift the mood with a joke.\n\"You don't have to pretend, Rhea,\" Austin said quietly, his eyes steady and serious.\nHer smile faded. Her shoulders dropped.\nAustin stepped closer and stood beside her. For a moment, neither of them spoke. They simply looked up at the sky, where stars shimmered across the dark canvas.\nThen, Austin broke the silence.\n\"Do you remember the first day at the academy? You picked a fight with a few nobles who were bullying that girl for being overweight?\"\nRhea let out a soft, tired laugh. \"Yeah… and in the end, the bullied girl had to take me to the infirmary.\"\nShe touched her nose unconsciously. That day had ended with her nose dislocated and a scolding from the instructors.\nAustin chuckled gently. \"That was the day Rudolph fell for you.\"\nRhea turned to him, eyes wide with surprise.\nBut Austin kept his gaze on the stars, his voice calm.\n\"It wasn't your beauty that caught him,\" he said. \"It was your courage. Your strength. The way you stood up without hesitation for someone you didn't even know. That's what stayed with him.\"\nRhea's chest tightened. The weight of those words settled in her heart like a soft ache.\nThe stars above them continued to shine, silent witnesses to a memory that would never fade.\nLooking at her, Austin added,\n\"He respected your strength, Rhea. He believed you'd be the change this world needs. So don't betray his trust. Don't stop moving forward. You have a long path ahead.\"\nRhea's heart trembled at his words.\nShe knew Austin wouldn't lie to her… but still—\n\"Can I… really do that?\" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.\nAustin gave a soft hum. \"You have the strength. And now…\"\nHis tone dropped, his words slow and heavy with conviction.\n\"…you also have a very real reason to slaughter those things.\"\nA chill ran through her.\nThe weight of his words hit her like a silent wave.\nHer mind went still for a moment, sinking into that truth.\nYes. The one who took Rudolph was gone.\nBut there were more out there—thousands more.\nThey would return.\nTo kill. To destroy.\nTo take away more people she cared about.\nMore innocent lives would be lost.\nShe had always wanted to wield her weapon for peace.\nTo protect. To shape a world where no one had to cross the Sea of Separation to die on some forgotten battlefield, but to go there simply to enjoy the breeze.\nA world where the Council wasn't needed anymore.\nA world where no other girl like her would be orphaned by war.\nHer fingers curled into fists.\nHer grief didn't shrink—but now, it had a direction. A purpose.\nShe would not let Rudolph's belief in her be in vain.\nNot anymore.\nShe stepped forward and told him, \"Return to the academy soon so we can make a team.\" With her fists clenched, she added, \"It's time to step up the game and venture into the lands of the dead so we can prepare better.\"\nAustin smiled, \"I won't make you wait for long.\"\n-------**-------\nValerie was completely awake. Not only because she slept a lot in the afternoon, but also because she wanted to spend these moments with him.\nHer lord was by her side, currently combing her hair since she hasn't been able to wash it recently.\n\"Is it too rough?\" She asked, feeling a bit embarrassed that she was showing such an unsightly side.\nAustin smiled fondly, \"They are soft and fluffy.\" He pressed her hair against his cheek and enjoyed the sensation. She is so perfect, from head to toe.\n\"Umm...Austin, what are we going to do now?\"\nAustin raised his brows, \"We will cuddle and sleep?\" He told her.\nValerie chuckled, \"Not about now, but in life. Are we going to stay like this?\"\nAustin hummed, \"Although I would have liked to just enjoy these days, we should get back to the Academy. That is our information center for now.\"\nValerie nodded in understanding.\nThey have to remain vigilant about another ambush, and the Academy would be a good training place to help them prepare for the final war.\nAnd Valerie actually loved to be there. Spending her days as a student with her Lord.\nAustin glanced to his left before he suddenly got up from the bed.\n\"?? Austin?\" She asked with a tilt of her head as she saw him stepping back while facing her.\nAustin raised his hand and snapped his finger, startling Valerie, as suddenly several people appeared before her.\n\"Ehhh!?\"\n\"Happy birthday to you...happy birthday to you...happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday to you.\" They ignored her shock and sang the birthday song, including Austin.\nHer mother held the cake, and every adult was wearing a birthday cap—including the King!\nAustin also wore a birthday hat and blew a small party popper.\nSeeing them celebrating her birthday, several emotions swirled in her chest.\nShock turned to elation and relief as she smiled foolishly at them.\n\"Come on, Valerie. Blow out the candles and make a wish.\" Her mother rested the cake before her and urged the girl.\nValerie glanced at her lover and saw him smiling at her.\nValerie closed her eyes and made the wish,\n'I wish to....'\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- If it happens and if I remember this chapter, I will let you know what she asked for 👀",

      "content": "The academy was about to begin, but Austin and Valerie couldn't return just yet.\nWhy? Because they had to visit the Council Office and attend an important meeting—one that would decide the future of their world's safety.\nAll the rulers from every nation, along with every S-rank hunter, would be present.\nSkipping it wasn't an option.\nSo, Austin chose to take a few days off from the academy. The meeting had to come first.\nThey were traveling by carriage, heading toward the Council Headquarters. The sun had just risen, casting a soft golden glow across the quiet road.\n\"How do you feel now, Valerie?\" Cedric asked gently, eyes still scanning the document in his hands.\n\"I feel like myself again. Thanks to the right medicine and food,\" she answered with a soft smile.\nAnd your son's love... she thought, but left it unsaid.\nAustin sat beside her, polishing Wisp with practiced hands. At her words, a faint smile appeared on his lips.\n\"You should still rest more when we get the chance,\" he said, his tone calm but caring.\nIt was early in the morning, and they would arrive at the Council by afternoon. The meeting might stretch until nightfall, and Austin wanted her to conserve her strength. He wouldn't feel at ease until she was fully healed.\nCedric finally set the papers aside, his fingers steepled in thought. He looked up at his son.\n\"Austin,\" he began, \"what do you plan to do after graduation?\"\nAustin gave a small shrug. \"Nothing much. Haven't thought that far.\"\nCedric sighed. It wasn't a sigh of disappointment, just one of quiet concern. \"If you're not too busy, how about staying in the capital for a while? Spend some time with Arthur. Learn a thing or two from him.\"\nThere was no pressure in his voice—just a father gently offering a direction, hoping his son would take a step toward something he had left behind.\nValerie tensed as she glanced at her lover. Just like her, he must have also sensed what he was indicating here.\nAustin exhaled an audible breath, as he asked, \"So you want me to become the crowned Prince after all, huh? I thought I had convinced you to make Averis the next head.\"\nAveris was a true ruler, someone who knew Eryndor better than he and possessed excellent management skills. Not to mention, she is an academic monster.\nThere is no shortage of bold intent in her, and coupled with her strong A-rank Shard, she would make a strong Queen.\n\"It's not that I am against making her the next ruler...it's just the rumors of you being no longer a part of the family that have been circulating around lately.\"\nThe incident with Adrian was known to every kingdom, not because it held great political significance, but because it was a family drama that everyone liked to gossip about.\nBut it was a fact that every ruler across the globe and the Council knew that Austin had taken an oath to never accept the crown.\n\"As a ruler, I am requesting you, Austin—Eryndor needs a deterrent now.\" His tone was serious, \"Our nation has always been belittled and taken very lightly. Even during the war, we were in the red zone, but the Council decided to inform us at the end.\"\nWith his gaze turning sharp and slight agitation lacing his voice, he added, \"Do you think I don't feel anything by being treated so unfairly?\"\nAustin's expression softened. His father did everything in his power not to let Eryndor become a part of Ademerg, which many kingdoms, including the Council, wanted initially.\nEryndor had never been significant to any kingdom, except for Drenovar, and after the demise of the previous King, the nation was in its most vulnerable position.\nAlthough very few realize it, it was a fact that Cedric had saved his motherland from perishing.\nHe has fought for its existence.\nAustin rested his hand on his father's and told him, \"Don't worry, father. Eryndor's situation is going to change very soon.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nSince the council office wasn't too far, they didn't stop to rest and kept moving until the middle of the day.\nBut the moment they arrived, Cedric felt a strange chill run through his chest. His heart trembled.\nThe town where the Headquarters once stood… was now nothing more than a graveyard of ruins.\nThe buildings were shattered, roofs caved in, their walls blackened by fire. Bloodstains painted the ground in places, faint but haunting. Soldiers wandered the area, their faces grim, carefully checking the wreckage—still hoping, perhaps, to find someone alive… or at least to count the dead.\nThe land itself looked scorched, as if it had been burned by something far worse than ordinary flames. And above it all, the sky hung heavy, as if mourning the town below.\nA thick silence wrapped around everything. Not the quiet of peace, but the quiet after a scream. The kind that sinks deep into your bones and leaves your soul uneasy.\nCedric couldn't speak. He just sat there, staring at the place that was once full of life—and now, full of loss.\nAlthough the citizens were evacuated, the soldiers who died here were numerous. The lively town, which was believed to be the safest place, has turned into a barren land.\nSeveral memories flashed through the two teenagers' heads as they gazed at the battlefield.\nAlthough the war only lasted for a day, it left several deep and unforgettable memories...or to say, nightmares to them.\n'A war can never bring good to any side...' Austin muttered under his breath and decided to close the curtains.\nThe carriage, after a few minutes, finally came to a stop.\nThe soldiers have already covered the path, and Thomas—the Commander—opened the carriage for the three.\nCedric stepped out, followed by the two teenagers.\nThe daunting tower before them was reconstructed in these few days, but still, the wreckage could be seen.\nAn officer was waiting for them near the entrance, who said, \"I will guide you to the resting room.\"\nCedric nodded before the trio, along with the Knight Commander, started walking.\nOnly one guard was allowed per person, but Austin and Valerie didn't need anyone, so...\n\"Can I have a minute?\" They were interrupted as someone called from behind.\nThe four of them turned and found a violet-haired lady standing there.\n\"Selner...\" Austin haven't been able to contact her ever since that day, and there were things he wanted to ask her.\nThat's why, \"You guys go ahead. I will join later.\"\nValerie looked at her beloved, asking if there was something wrong.\nAustin gave her hand an assuring squeeze and whispered, \"I just want to talk to her. Nothing concerning.\"\nValerie nodded and took another glance at Selner before she started walking again.\nAustin approached the lady.\nSince there was not much space in the gallery and their words could be heard by anyone, Selner invited Austin to his office.\n*Click*\nOnce they were inside, Austin called out, \"Where have you been. I haven't seen you ever since that day.\"\nThe last time he saw her was when Valerie returned to him. Although she couldn't have been of any help during the war because of her restriction, Austin hoped to see her after the clouds of chaos settled.\nSelner heaved a sigh as she sat on her chair and asked him, \"You absorbed the Fourth Fragment...yet you are safe.\"\nAustin nodded, \"I wouldn't have taken the chance unless I knew I would survive.\"\nSelner didn't need to ask to know that the System helped him achieve something so impossible.\nPreparing one's body to take such a heavy load in a few moments was impossible.\n\"Can I assess your Soul?\" She asked, and Austin, without hesitation, summoned Scar.\nThe greyish-black blade resonated with his presence, making Selner already feel that he had gotten a hold of it.\nShe touched the blade and inspected it, \"Although you possess it now, you don't have the reserve to keep holding it for long.\"\nShe gestured to him to store it back as Austin spoke, \"Yeah, I know. Scar hasn't recognised me as his master as of now, that's why the magic consumption is heavy at the moment.\"\nSelner nodded, \"That's right...but you won't die if you use it moderately.\"\nAustin assured her, \"Scar is still my last plan. I have several tools and weapons in my arsenal with whom I can win a battle.\"\nHe has spent so many days in the dungeons and spent so many EXP for a reason.\nHe doesn't want to become dependent on a single tool. He wishes to become a single man battalion.\nA brief moment of silence descended before Austin asked, \"You never told me...\" Looking at her, he added, \"...that you were married to Austin.\"\nSelner wasn't surprised, but still it took her off guard, \"I mean...what was there to say? You are a whole new person and already have some you adore. The Austin I loved and married is already gone...so, don't think about it.\"\nAlthough she said that casually, the way she looked away from him and crossed her arms, it was apparent that she was hiding her true feelings.\nAustin stepped closer to her and rested his hand on her head.\nSelner's eyes widened as she heard him saying, \"I might not be your partner, but you can always rely on me, okay? And it's not because I want to repay your favors, but because I want to do it.\"\nA few seconds passed.\nSelner didn't lift her head, and just gave a faint nod.\nHer expression was unreadable, and considering she might need some time alone, Austin didn't remain in the office for long.\nThey might not be together in this timeline, but Selner was an irreplaceable person in his life.\nSomeone he wishes to keep safe.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "They were given a fairly spacious room to rest in until the meeting began in the evening.\nInside, there was a small tea table, two beds for anyone who wanted to lie down, and a few other essentials to make their stay comfortable.\nThe attendant who guided them explained that a server would remain stationed outside their door at all times. If they needed anything, they just had to ask.\nThomas stood by the door, back straight, eyes alert—on guard as always.\nCedric glanced at him and said gently, \"You can relax a little, Thomas. We've got time.\"\nBut the man shook his head and replied, \"Once you join the meeting, I'll have nothing left to do. I'll rest then.\"\nIt was a fair argument. No one other than the selected guests could enter the conference hall, so Thomas wouldn't have any duties once it started.\nCedric nodded and didn't press further.\nAustin hadn't returned yet.\nWith some time on his hands, Cedric sat down with the document the Prime Minister had handed him earlier and began to read through it.\nValerie, meanwhile, scanned the room and spotted a kettle and a few supplies neatly arranged on a side table. Tea leaves, coffee, sugar, and milk.\nDeciding to prepare something warm for her father-in-law—and for Austin when he returned—she picked up the kettle, rinsed it, and filled it with milk. Then, she began mixing coffee and sugar into two cups while keeping an eye on the boiling milk.\nThe quiet clinking of the spoon against the porcelain filled the room… until Cedric's voice suddenly broke the silence.\n\"Valerie.\"\nCedric didn't look up from the file in his hand as he asked, \"Did you talk to Austin about marriage?\"\nHer heart skipped a beat.\nThe spoon in her hand paused for a second, trembling slightly.\nHe asked it so casually—but to her, it was anything but casual.\nShe drew in a slow breath and answered honestly, \"We… never had a serious conversation about it.\"\nCedric let out a thoughtful hum. \"Alright. I'll speak to him when he gets back.\"\nValerie panicked…talk? Talk?! About the wedding? So suddenly?\nWill her Lord think she told his father to talk about it? No, he won't…think she would go that far. Right?\nLike she was desperate…but-but she won't force him to get married. She wants to start a family, but not by forcing her will on him.\nShe could have told her father-in-law that he doesn't need to worry about it since they would talk things out and decide on their own…but she remained silent.\n'Bad Valerie…' She scolded herself but showed no sign of saying anything. She was pretending she didn't hear anything from the King and resumed brewing coffee.\nAfter a few minutes, the door parted and revealed the face she expected.\nAustin smiled as he approached her, \"You are making something?\" He hugged her waist, much to her panic.\n\"Y-Your father…is here.\" She softly said, but made no move to remove herself from his hold.\nAustin glanced at his father, and as expected of his Dad, he turned towards the wall with his head bowed and eyes focused on the file.\nThomas was standing at an angle where he could not see them because of the partition wall.\nAustin took advantage of her ignorance and softly bit her ear.\nA shiver ran down her spine as she bit her lip to prevent the sound she was about to let out.\nShe turned her eyes toward him, glaring.\nBut with that flushed face, she appeared like a hamster whose food had been snatched after being forced to run for hours.\nGod…he wanted to kiss her.\n\"Austin,\" His father called out, and Valerie instantly stepped forward, freeing herself.\nIf this continues, she won't be able to face her father-in-law!\nWhy must her Lord be so cruel?\nShe…she will bite him once they are alone. A strong bite.\nBlood and all…\n…no, blood would be too much.\nTeeth marks work.\nWhile Valerie was deciding the punishment for her lover, Austin advanced towards his father and asked him, \"What happened?\"\n\"Sit here.\" He gestured towards the seat beside him.\nAustin's brows elevated as he nodded and sat down.\nCedric closed the file and turned towards his son before he asked, \"Have you thought about marriage?\"\n\"...\" Austin was taken aback.\nHis father suddenly talked about the wedding.\nHe glanced at Valerie, but she was facing the other side, intentionally ignoring him.\nAustin turned towards his father, \"Why…are you suddenly interested in the wedding?\"\n\"Because I don't want you to delay things anymore and make my daughter-in-law wait. You both are already at that age, and you will graduate in a few months, too.\"\nCedric's perspective was clear—if you have a girl you love and if you both are committed to each other, there shouldn't be any delay in tying the knot.\n\"Look, son-\"\n\"I will marry her.\" He declared, and Valerie flinched.\nShe turned to look at him, her cheeks flushed and eyes wide.\nAustin didn't waver from continuing, \"I will marry her as soon as we graduate. I had it in mind already but wanted to ask Valerie first before making the announcement.\"\nSighing, he added, \"But since you have already brought it up…\"\nCedric grinned, \"That's like my boy. I respect your determination.\"\nHe patted his shoulder proudly.\nMeanwhile, Valerie rested her hands on the kitchen shelf, her hair covering her face and behind the curtain she was hiding a face that showed a single emotion.\nHappiness.\n°°°°°°°\nAround five in the evening, they heard a knock on the door.\nThomas opened it, and the same officer who guided them informed them, \"The meeting is about to start.\"\nCedric nodded before he got up, followed by the other two.\nAustin walked close to Valerie as he asked her, \"You really didn't know about it?\"\nValerie looked away, her ears red, \"I have no clue what you are talking about.\"\nHe grinned, softly colliding his shoulder to her, \"You don't need to hide it. I will understand and don't tell anyone that Val took the initiative of asking me for marriage.\"\nValerie's eyes widened as she looked at him.\n\"I-I…\"\nAustin chuckled, \"I am joking, Val.\" Bringing her hand to his lips, he kissed it gently and told her, \"Although you already agreed, I will make a formal proposal.\"\nValerie's shoulders relaxed, \"You don't need to…\" but she wanted one so she didn't show reluctance much.\nSoon, they came to a pause before two huge wooden doors.\nThe man pushed open the door, and the three of them stepped inside.\nThe meeting with the world rulers begins now.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "The Seven Nations:\nIn the far south, cradled by the sea, lay Drenovar, a nation known for its vibrant ports and deep naval roots.\nTo the far east, surrounded by endless dunes, stood Trevak, a land of heat and hardship.\nBeside it, a land rich with beauty—Vetille, famed for its breathtaking landscapes and healing hot springs, often visited by travelers seeking peace.\nAt the center of the map was Elarith, the bustling heart of trade, where gold spoke louder than words.\nTo the north, hidden among ancient trees, was Eryndor, a nation guarded by its wild forests and even wilder traditions.\nNorthwest stood Hener, where the clang of hammers echoed day and night, the land of blacksmiths and the largest weapon supply.\nAnd nestled beside the mountains like a secret waiting to be uncovered was Ademerg, silent, strong, and watchful.\nThe war had scarred them all—some received mental damage, while some incurred both mental and physical damage.\nNow, the kings of these seven nations have gathered under one roof. Alongside them were the eight S-rank heroes—champions who had stood on the front lines—and a special guest.\nTogether, there were nineteen souls at a great round table, brought together not by peace, but by the shared memory of bloodshed.\nThe hall was quiet, filled with the soft shuffle of robes and armor, the creak of chairs, and the tension in every breath.\n\"Unless an S-rank is absent, only three Council Heads are allowed at this table,\" Austin murmured under his breath. He pulled out a chair for Valerie with a small nod. His eyes scanned the room.\nA few people who knew each other from past missions or alliances sat close, finding comfort in familiar faces.\nCedric chose the seat beside someone who had once pulled him from the edge of despair.\n\"How have you been, Cedric?\" came a warm voice.\nIt was Idris, King of Drenovar, wearing a soft smile that lit up his usually serious face.\nThe warmth in his tone caught many off guard. Though word had spread that the past tensions between Eryndor and Drenovar had cooled, few expected such genuine friendship. It wasn't just politics—it was personal.\nAs the two kings spoke quietly, their shared respect visible in every glance, Austin's gaze drifted across the table.\nHe spotted the King of Ademerg—Eden. The older man met his gaze, offering a brief but sincere smile, followed by a respectful nod.\nThey had only recently become acquainted during the war's preparations, but in that short time, Austin had come to respect the quiet strength Eden carried. There was something grounding about him, like the mountains his kingdom guarded.\nHis gaze drifted next to the Queen of Vetille—Rinne Velenna.\nShe stood out even among royalty. Her long black hair cascaded down her back like a shadow, and her eyes—dull gold, like faded sunlight—seemed to hold stories no one had ever heard aloud.\nShe was speaking with a man Austin had never met, but he knew exactly who he was.\nZurkis, the King of Hener. Parkinson's father.\nAs if sensing the weight of Austin's stare, Zurkis turned. Their eyes met.\nFor a moment, the world stilled.\nThere was something unreadable in the older man's expression—calm, sharp, and distant, like a sword sheathed behind diplomacy.\nThe stare lingered only for seconds, but it felt longer. Then Zurkis turned back to the Queen, resuming their conversation as if the moment hadn't happened.\nAustin was well aware that the notice of exile and the conspiracy against him were planned by Zurkis, but there was no point in mentioning anything about it now.\nAustin's attention moved again, this time landing on the King of Trevak.\nHe was laughing gently with Thea, one of the S-ranks. Judging by their ease with each other, they were more than acquaintances. Perhaps old allies. Perhaps something more.\nAside from Thea, only two other S-ranks were present: the elegant and quiet Charlotte and the second-ranked warrior, Olivia.\n\"Hey, girlie,\" Olivia grinned, tossing a casual wave in Valerie's direction. Her voice was teasing, playful, but under it, a challenge flickered.\nAustin turned to Valerie. Her posture stiffened, and a dark shadow passed over her face.\n\"You know her?\" he asked quietly.\nValerie gave a tight nod. \"When you went to the other side,\" she said, her voice low, \"she's the one who stopped me from going after you.\"\nAustin blinked. \"Ah… Right. Selner did say she ordered someone to keep you back.\"\nValerie didn't answer; her gaze was locked on Olivia. It wasn't anger exactly—but something colder. A quiet hurt that had yet to be healed.\nAustin let out a soft breath. Now he understood. Olivia had only done her duty, probably without malice. Still, he couldn't blame the warrior.\nAustin couldn't have afforded to have Valerie on the other side, so what Olivia did, he might thank her later.\nHe looked back at the table, realizing how much lay beneath the surface here. Old wounds. Hidden truths. Fragile peace stitched together by shared loss.\nAustin shared a brief smile with Charlotte across the table, a moment of calm amid the storm of faces and unreadable expressions.\nThen the grand doors of the conference hall opened with a low groan, drawing every gaze toward the entrance.\nA group of figures stepped inside, dressed in flowing white robes, their steps measured, almost ceremonial. No one at the table stood to greet them, but the silence that followed was louder than any welcome. All eyes, curious and cautious, locked onto the last man who entered and gently closed the doors behind him.\nHe was tall, with sun-blond hair and a calm, unreadable expression. He moved with quiet power, the kind that didn't need to be announced.\nThe strongest warrior alive had arrived.\nThere was no need for fanfare. His presence alone said everything.\nAs the robed figures took their seats, the air in the room seemed to shift, heavier, more serious. The time for pleasantries had passed.\nNow, seated around the great table were three Council Heads, four of the eight S-rank warriors, including the one at the top, and an audience of kings and the only queen.\nThen, another voice broke the silence.\nA tall, lanky man stepped forward, his curly hair tousled as though he hadn't noticed, or didn't care. His bright brown eyes swept across the room, open and steady.\n\"I'd like to introduce the three chiefs first,\" he said, his tone soft yet somehow clear enough to reach every corner of the hall.\nHe gestured to the left.\n\"This is Sir Desmond,\" he said, nodding to a man with dark skin, white hair, and striking violet eyes.\nHis posture was relaxed, but there was a sharpness in his gaze, like a blade that didn't show itself unless it needed to.\nBeside him sat a woman with long black hair streaked with gray. Her face bore the signs of time, but her eyes held a quiet, commanding strength.\n\"She is Madam Clara.\"\nAnd lastly, a bald man with piercing green eyes gave a slight nod as he was introduced.\n\"He is Sir Nelson.\"\nThe speaker placed a hand over his chest in a respectful gesture. \"And I am Isaac, the moderator of this meeting.\"\nA faint smile touched his lips—measured, but not cold.\n\"Let's begin this meeting,\" he said, \"with the hope that, by the end of this day, we reach a conclusion that brings not only strength, but understanding.\"\nThe room stayed silent for a breath longer, as if everyone was bracing for what was to come.\nBecause what they discussed here wouldn't just shape nations.\nIt could decide their survival.\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thank you for reading.

      "content": "The focus of the meeting was to reflect on the events that unfolded just a few days ago.\nEveryone in the room had either witnessed or heard about the chaos—the disaster that struck without warning. And yet, it was thanks to the courage of the brave warriors—those present here, those who couldn't make it, and those who gave their lives—that the catastrophe was brought under control.\nTheir combined efforts ensured that not a single civilian was caught in harm's way.\nThey fought with everything they had, risking their lives. And through their courage, they proved that even when outnumbered, humanity can still stand strong, protect its people, and drive the enemy back.\n\"I couldn't be more proud to share this room with the warriors who stood between humanity and its possible end,\" Isaac said, his voice filled with awe and deep admiration for those around him.\nThe room remained silent, the weight of his words settling in.\nThe moderator picked up where he left off. \"Although we suffered several losses… please don't carry the burden alone. Each of you went beyond what we ever expected—\"\n\"Eh, but I didn't fight,\" Olivia cut in, her voice calm but clear, instantly drawing every eye in the room.\nShe had been stationed near the council heads, guarding one of the critical bunkers.\nIsaac blinked, momentarily surprised, but quickly recovered. \"Miss Olivia also showed unwavering dedication by protecting the defense pillars. She fulfilled her role with excellence,\" he added smoothly, making sure the atmosphere didn't turn awkward.\nShifting his gaze back to the gathered warriors, he asked, \"Before we move on to the plans we've prepared for what's ahead—does anyone have a question or anything they'd like to say?\"\nThe question came from none other than the supreme authority of Hener.\n\"May I ask… who was it that decimated the commander of the demonic forces? I've heard a few rumors, but hearing it directly from the Council would clear the air.\"\nHis words stirred the room. Everyone had heard the same whispers—stories that bordered on the unbelievable.\nThat's why all eyes turned to the Council, waiting to hear the truth.\nIsaac hesitated. A trace of unease flickered in his expression as he glanced repeatedly toward the Council Heads, unsure whether he should speak.\nThankfully, he didn't have to.\n\"It was the Prince of Eryndor,\" came a calm yet powerful voice.\nEveryone turned as Nelson, one of the Council Heads, continued, \"Austin Eryndor not only slaughtered the Parasite King, but also wiped out the demonic forces marching toward Eryndor.\"\nThe room fell silent. Nelson's words quieted every thought.\nIt was one thing to hear wild tales from hushed voices or even trusted sources. But to hear it confirmed by a Council Head, someone known to have eyes across the world, left no room for doubt.\nAustin Eryndor had indeed brought down the Demonic General.\nA brief silence followed Nelson's declaration—then came a sharp question.\n\"Is there any proof?\" asked a stern voice.\nIt belonged to Liam Elarith, the Supreme of the wealthiest nation, Elarith. His tone was firm, his gaze unwavering.\nValerie narrowed her eyes at him, clearly displeased, while a few other rulers exchanged glances, some even appearing impressed by Liam's boldness.\nAustin and Cedric, however, wore the same unreadable expression—calm indifference.\nThey had anticipated this. Before stepping into this room, they already knew there would be skeptics. People who'd only believe what aligned with their own narrow perceptions.\nNelson didn't react strongly but still seemed displeased.\n\"And why do you believe I'd have any reason to lie here?\" he replied, voice cool and composed.\nIt doesn't matter which ruler was in front of them. The Council Heads know their authority and could show frustration openly when they are questioned.\nLiam didn't flinch as he spoke again, his voice calm but cutting.\n\"We all know the Prince's capabilities. And to believe he single-handedly slaughtered a being that even S-ranks struggled to handle… and not just that, but also held back several hundred demons? It would be foolish to accept such claims without question.\"\nHis words carried weight. Though the Prince had proven himself during the demonic assault at the Tournament, this situation was of an entirely different scale—far beyond what anyone could have expected.\nAustin let out a quiet sigh and gently clasped his lover's hand, silently hoping she wouldn't lose her temper.\nBut the next voice to speak wasn't Nelson's. Nor the moderator's.\nIt was the number one ranked warrior.\n\"It seemed impossible... even to me,\" William said, his gaze lowered to the table, his tone low and reflective, like someone replaying a vivid memory.\n\"I've seen him fight before. Back then, I didn't think he'd be of much help against high-ranking demons.\"\nHe paused, then continued, voice tightening with emotion.\n\"But those same eyes that once saw him struggling against a handful of demons… also saw him tear through hundreds like they were nothing. The same eyes that once saw him trembling in front of the Parasite King... witnessed the exact moment Austin split that monster in two.\"\nFinally, William lifted his gaze, locking eyes with Liam.\n\"Whether you believe me or not is your choice, Sir Liam. But one thing remains certain—if Austin hadn't been there, I wouldn't be sitting here. Neither would Charlotte. Nor many others in this room.\"\nHis words fell like a stone in a peaceful lake. The ripples spread out, and slowly, every mind was abuzz.\nThe words of the warrior who was present there on the battlefield, and doesn't have any benefit from falsely praising Austin...the others couldn't take it lightly.\nThe moderator realized it was time to say something, so he told them, \"Sir Austin has already given a report of his double awakening. He hasn't registered his Shard, but there is proof that the skill used to eradicate the army was something only he could achieve.\"\nThat was a half lie. He reported his re-awakening, but nothing about his Shard's ability.\nGuess, the moderator was being kind.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "\"A barrier? How?\" The question was asked by one, but felt by everyone after they heard from Isaac about creating a barrier before the mainland to ensure that if the other side strikes again, they would know.\nThey were saved by the soothsayer this time, but not every time someone would predict that the demonic forces would be ambushing the human realm.\nAs such, \"A floating town before the mainland, houses made on water, their pillars going down to the surface of the sea. And in those houses, there would be soldiers who would keep a lookout and also inform us if they spot any suspicious movements.\"\nThe idea sounded plausible but dangerous. To cover such a vast area, hundreds of soldiers would be required, who would always be in the red zone. They would be the first target of the demons if they really decided to attack again.\n\"Is there really no alternative? It sounds ...we would compromise a lot in exchange for assurance.\" Idris called out, sounding unsure and carrying the voice of many in the room, including William's.\nThe silverhead asked in a plain voice, \"Is there any better idea you may have?\" His voice contained no emotion, but that itself sounded as if he were insulting the other person.\nIdris's gaze sharpened, \"I never was told the prospectus of this meeting, how was I supposed to prepare for any strategy?\"\nThe atmosphere between the two grew tense, the weight of unspoken challenges thickening the air, until Cedric finally stepped in.\n\"This whole argument is irrational, no matter how you look at it,\" he said firmly. \"We're not just sharing a border with the other side—we're surrounded by them. Completely. To guard such a massive area would take thousands of warriors… and even then, for what?\"\nHe glanced around the room, eyes sharp.\n\"There are aerial beasts out there that no ground force could possibly detect or intercept. Not in time.\"\n\"I agree with him.\" Rinne, the only female ruler in the room, added, \"Too much risk for such an uncertain benefit.\"\nNelson sighed and leaned back in his seat, \"We are ready to accept suggestions. We are gathered here to draw a conclusion on how we could create a detection ring around our mainland.\"\nThe idea was thought of by a Council Head but was not accepted by everyone at the time. That's why it was mentioned in the meeting, rather than taking the decision on their own.\nAmidst the growing silence, the voice of the blond Prince resonated, \"Why are we thinking about defending?\"\nNelson's brows elevated as he and others, as well, turned towards the boy.\n\"Mister Austin?\" Issac asked.\nAustin didn't want to interfere in this meeting at all, but seeing what a rubbish plan they had come up with, he had to say something.\nLeaning forward, he rested his arms on the table and said, \"How long are we going to remain defensive? I have been to the other side, so I know they have forces in the millions. Any night, they could plan to infiltrate our homes and kill thousands.\"\nThe weight of those words was felt by everyone in the room.\nThere was no denying it that he had crossed the borders and had returned safely as well, so his words couldn't be taken lightly.\nBut what he was suggesting remained ambiguous for some, urging Desmond to say, \"Why don't you put your suggestion clearly?\"\nAustin straightforwardly stated, \"A war.\"\n\"..!!\" Brows elevated, eyes widened, and breath was caught in their throats\nThe bold statement from the young man took everyone, including Valerie and Cedric, by surprise.\nThey have faced a war just a few days ago, and he was a part of it, so for him to suddenly suggest waging another war clearly was unexpected.\n\"Are you really saying that? After witnessing so many losses, can you really suggest another war?!\" Liam countered, his tone louder than before, and his state excited.\n\"While you were peacefully resting inside your safe palace, I was standing there on the frontline and witnessed the losses.\" With his voice growing dimmer, he added, \"I have also...lost my loved ones during this incident.\"\nDirecting a sharp gaze at him, he said, \"So you don't need to remind me what a war could cause and take away from us.\"\nLiam gritted his teeth, but didn't lose his cool. He had enough rationality to know that saying anything against him would only make others speak against him.\n\"But Austin...everything has finally returned to normal...shouldn't we ease up the stress from our people and soldiers?\" Thea suggested.\n\"Normal, Lady Thea?\" Austin asked, a bit of amazement in his voice, \"Demons infiltrate our lands without notice and slaughter hundreds of our people. Those who can defend and those who can't are all hunted by them. And this will continue for eternity, since, unlike us, who need time and resources to become warriors, they are born hunters. They are born with the will of their Lord, their King. And that will is to slaughter every human.\"\nEach syllable quieted the room further and further. The expression on their faces was grim, none of them holding the intention to rebuke what he said since none of it was untrue.\nAustin's voice held the agitation and grief he had felt because of the war. The sense of loss and helplessness has never been so vivid as it was when he saw Sebastian and Rudolph die before his eyes.\nValerie worryingly looked at her Lord, wanting to touch him...to hug him. But she was helpless at the moment.\nGathering himself, Austin concluded, \"In the end, I'd like to suggest this—if we keep waiting for them to strike just so we can defend, we'll continue to lose countless lives. Instead, we should take the fight to them. Start targeting their forces, weaken them piece by piece… and when the time is right, we deliver a final blow that wipes out the demon race for good.\"\nThere was no other way. Austin couldn't do everything on his own. He wouldn't repeat the same mistake as his previous version. And to gain the support of these people, he first needs to make them see the bigger picture.\nFor quite a few minutes, everyone remained silent, thinking about what he said, and slowly they realized the necessity of taking action.\n\"Let's take a break and rejoin the discussion at ten.\" The Moderator suddenly spoke, and no voice of resistance was raised.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Austin has tasted blood, and now, he only wants war!!!

      "content": "\"Mmm…\" Austin mumbled in his sleep, slowly stirring awake.\nThe meeting had dragged on until two in the morning, and by the time it ended, they were both too exhausted to do much else.\nThere were only two beds in the room, not nearly big enough for two people each. So, Austin insisted on getting another room—and surprisingly, they agreed without hesitation.\nThanks to that, he got to spend the night alone with his lover. Even though the single bed wasn't exactly meant for two, they made it work. Their bodies were so close, so tightly tangled together, that there was still enough space for someone to sit at the edge.\nBut Valerie never complained about his clinginess. In fact, she welcomed it, so Austin never held back. He'd wrap his arms around her like she was the only warmth he ever needed, as if leaving even a sliver of space between them would keep him restless.\n\"You awake?\" he asked softly, noticing her eyes slowly fluttering open\n\"Mm.\" She nodded, then turned toward him. \"I'm cold,\" she whispered.\nWithout hesitation, Austin slid his warm hand beneath her shirt, gently wrapping it around her waist. Her face pressed against his bare chest, and his breath—hot and steady—washed over her like the heat she'd been yearning for.\n\"You were using magic in your sleep again,\" he murmured. \"Were you having bad dreams?\"\nUncontrolled magic without a summoned shard—something like that only happened when emotions ran too high, even in dreams.\nAnd in their sleep, people often lose their control over their emotions.\nIt explains why there was frost clinging to the wall and ceiling.\nValerie kept her eyes open but didn't respond to his question. Rather, she asked, \"Do you…really believe war is the only solution?\"\nLast night, the Council Heads and five out of seven rulers agreed to his point. They needed to strike this time or they would continue to incur losses time after time.\nAustin heaved a sigh, his lover seemed quite emotional.\nA rational Valerie who stands in the battlefield might have appreciated this decision, but the current her was more thinking of the possibilities and consequences.\nAustin couldn't blame her, nor could he bring himself to get upset.\nSlowly running his hand on her back, he told her, \"Their eyes are locked on me. They want me to disappear before their liege appears. As such, if we don't do anything, I would continue to get targeted.\"\nValerie's fingers curled around his shirt, \"Is there no way to put an end to this without getting you in danger?\"\nAustin chuckled…they think very similarly. But, \"This war is not something to be fought by a single person. As much as you and I want to keep each other safe, we would be facing dangerous situations in the future.\"\nValerie closed her eyes again, indicating that she didn't want to think about it, so Austin didn't mention anything further.\nWhy should he destroy her present because of the future?\nThey cuddled for a few more moments, whispering sweet things, and the mood returned to normal.\nSoon Austin got up and approached the counter, intending to make some black coffee.\nValerie slowly rose from the bed as well, and asked, \"Um...about yesterday...I really didn't ask Father to mention anything about marriage.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"I know, Val. And it's not like if you had demanded getting married, I would have minded.\" Turning to look at her over his shoulder, he added, \"Rather, I would have been overjoyed.\"\nValerie turned silent, her eyes unmoving and her ears slightly hot.\nThere was something unfair about his gaze. The way he looks at the world and when he looks at her...she couldn't help but feel special. The fondness he carries makes the butterflies in her stomach dance.\n*Knock*\nThe sudden knock broke their trance before Austin asked, \"Who is it?\"\n\"It's me, Your Highness. His Majesty has asked you to join him for breakfast.\" It was Thomas.\nAustin hummed, and soon the man walked away.\nValerie got up from the seat and said, \"I forgot my bag in the other room.\"\nAustin smilingly pulled out a pair of jeans and a top from his Inventory before putting them on the bed.\nValerie blinked in surprise, not because of him pulling things out of thin air—she had gotten used to it—but because, \"How do you know my size?\" There was even underwear!\nAustin grinned, \"I know every inch of your body.\"\n\"...!\"\nAlert! Need urgent ice pack!\n°°°°°°°\nAustin and Valerie reached his father's room after an hour and were informed, \"We are having breakfast with Idris. He came here with his family.\"\nAustin's brows elevated...\"Coming to a warzone with family? That's strange.\"\nCedric chuckled, \"I also said that. He said they wanted to visit Eryndor so he used the opportunity.\"\n\"Oh, so they are coming along, eh?\"\nCedric nodded, \"All the other rulers give a notice of their visit a month or at least ten days before their arrival. But he doesn't believe in such formality. He is going there just as a friend.\"\nHearing those words, Austin couldn't help but ask, \"Lord Idris got quite friendly in no time.\"\nCedric hummed, \"He is a nice man.\"\nThey soon exited the building, and approached the open space before the establishment .\nSeveral carriages were stationed in a round formation and in the middle of it could be found a family laughing and chatting merrily.\nThey were approaching the family when suddenly,\n\"Hello!\" Someone suddenly appeared before Austin, startling him,\n\"Ah...hey.\" he smiled at the girl whom he once saved back in Drenovar.\nThe Princess who was wandering in the market was getting chased by a demon.\nThe girl fondly smiled at him, ignoring Valerie completely as she said, \"I have prepared something for you. Come with me.\" She held his arm and began pulling—\n—leaving a blank Valerie behind.\nAs a reward for her role in the war, can she finally get it?\nThe licence to kill?\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Go for it. The God of the story approves it.",

      "content": "\"How is she?\" Philius asked quietly, his eyes fixed on the empty table before him. There was nothing written there—nothing to focus on—but he couldn't bring himself to look up.\nThe Vice-Headmaster replied, \"She's behaving normally, at least on the surface. But Professor Morkel suggested it would be best to place a few roommates with her for now.\"\nIt had been a few days since Rhea returned to the academy, and classes had resumed.\nNo one wanted to talk about what had happened during the break, but it lingered in the air like a shadow.\nThe quiet whispers in the common halls, the empty seats left behind by students who had lost family in the war… everything was a constant reminder of the pain they had endured.\nRhea was one of them. She had been caught in the chaos. She had seen someone dear to her taken by the storm.\nPhilius couldn't fully understand her pain, but he had tried. He offered comfort, tried to give her something to hold on to, even if it was just a few hopeful words.\nAnd although Rhea smiled and spoke with the same gentle voice as before, pretending as if nothing had changed, her sorrow and anger were not hidden from anyone. It lived behind her eyes, always there, always waiting.\n\"Is there anything we can do to lift their spirits?\" Philius asked softly. He knew the semester had only just begun—and for the first-years, this was supposed to be the time to build foundations. But under these circumstances, something had to change. They needed a spark—some light in all this gloom.\nHayden remained silent, unable to think of anything right away. Then—\nKNOCK\nA firm knock broke the stillness.\n\"Who is it?\" Hayden asked, moving toward the door.\n\"It's me, sir. Austin.\"\nThe name caught them both off guard. The Vice-Headmaster shot a glance at Philius, surprised.\nPhilius didn't hesitate. \"Come in,\" he said, rising from his seat as the door slowly creaked open.\n\"…!\"\nThe moment Hayden's eyes met Austin's, he instinctively took a step back.\nThis was hunger.\nNot the kind that came from missing a meal—but the raw, feral hunger he had felt only from demonic beasts. A dark, consuming force that stripped away reason, leaving behind something terrifying and unnatural.\nYet the one standing before him wasn't a beast. Nor was he a demon.\nHe was a boy.\nA student.\nBut those eyes…\nThose eyes told a story—one that no teenager should ever carry.\nThey spoke of bloodshed and survival, of sights that could shatter a soul long before adulthood. Eyes that had seen too much, and perhaps lost too much as well.\nAustin wore his bloodlust like a second skin—a cloak that reeked of violence and power, heavy enough to suffocate. It wasn't just a feeling—it was a presence. The kind that could silence a room, make the strong falter, make the wise step aside.\nThis was the kind of aura only born from war… from slaughter. From having taken down not one, not ten, but hundreds, maybe even thousands.\nAnd Hayden, a man seasoned by years and hardened by battles, could see the truth.\nWhatever Austin had done—whatever he had survived—was not something he would ever boast about. It was not a medal. It was a mark.\nA weight he would carry for the rest of his life.\n\"Professor Hayden?\" Austin asked, having his feet stopped near the entrance.\n\"Control your emotions, my friend. He is still our student.\" The Headmaster sighed.\nThe ex-hunter blinked in surprise before realizing he had summoned his Shard.\nExhaling an audible breath, he apologized, \"Forgive my rudeness,\" his Shard fading into nothingness, as he said so.\nAustin wryly smiled, \"It's no problem. You are the second person who reacted like that.\" The first being Sheldon.\n\"Come, sit here.\" Philius gestured toward the chair as he also sat down.\nHayden took his position diagonally behind the headmaster as Austin took the offer and got seated as well.\n\"When did you return? I told the administrator chief to inform me.\"\nAustin smiled, \"Just now. The chief was about to rush toward your office, but I told him that I would go myself.\"\nPhilius frowned, \"Is there any urgent matter?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"Just came here to meet you and get the recommendation.\"\nHayden's brows elevated, \"You are pursuing further studies?\" Mostly, every third-year student asks for a recommendation if they want to continue their studies and become a professional in their field.\nHowever, \"No, sir. I want the recommendation for reassessment of my rank.\"\n\"Oh, so you finally decided to change the tag of D-rank, huh?\" Philius asked.\nThe boy before him was anything but a D-rank, but his identity card still showed such. Even before this war, he had proven himself to be on a par with a B-rank, so Philius had suggested that he get a re-assessment. At that time, Austin's response surprised him.\n'I don't want to settle for B-rank, sir.'\nAt that time, Philius was at a loss, as without having his Shard go through any evolution, how did he even progress so far?\nBut now, Philius could tell that he had made the right decision to wait.\n\"May I ask, how many evolutions has your Shard gone through?\" Hayden asked. The first thing asked during the assessment is one's Shard rank.\nAfter all, unless one's Shard doesn't go through evolutions, they couldn't ascend to a higher rank.\nAustin thought for a moment before lying, \"Three evolutions, sir.\" It has gone through four...but that would surely shock them beyond belief.\nNone of the Shards across the globe, including William's, has gone through four evolutions. As such, to not draw unnecessary attention, he lied.\nThere was no method for them to discern the fourth evolution during the assessment, so it was all sorted.\n\"Hmm...\" Philius's brows elevated while Hayden nodded in understanding.\nThe presence he held was surely not something anyone below 'S' could possess.\nAfter a brief pause, Philius told him, \"I will give you the letter. Do you need it right away?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"I will just enjoy some quiet days and join the classes. It has been quite chaotic recently.\"\nAustin could pay someone to just have a few leisurely days with his beloved. Ever since the tournament began, he has forgotten the meaning of peace.\n\"Austin...how are you?\" Philius asked out of the blue.\nAustin sighed, leaning back, his gaze fell on the table, \"Just holding myself together, trying to recover and look forward.\"\nSilence descended in the room. The other two were not close to the borders; their duty was to keep the students safe. However, they have heard the tales of the war. Those who proudly announce the victory they earned, and those who shared indiscriminate details on how many losses were incurred from both sides.\nAustin has also lost people close to him, yet he was sitting before them as if he had already moved on.\nPhilius has only once been a part of a war, and he was traumatized. The flashes of the incident kept him awake for many nights. The nightmares, the cold sweat, murmuring in his sleep...he has faced it all.\nLeaning forward and resting his arms on the table, the Headmaster softly relayed, \"No one can change what happened. You have to bear the burden and carry it forward. But don't ever consider showing your vulnerable side as a sign of your weakness. You do have friends and family who can support you, so rely on them.\"\nAustin smilingly nodded, \"Don't worry, sir. I don't belong to that group that tries to hide everything and get crushed under emotions each day.\"\nPhilius nodded, his eyes smiling.\nTo lighten up the mood, Hayden asked, \"Headmaster was thinking of an activity to uplift th students' mood. Do you have any suggestions?\"\nAustin was surprised, \"Is...this a part of the curriculum?\"\nPhilius chuckled, \"I make the curriculum. Don't worry and tell me if you have any suggestions.\"\nAustin hummed, thinking closely about what could be the best way to motivate them.\nAfter a bit of thinking, he said, \"I guess....a trip?\"\nHayden hummed in questioning, \"Trip? That's...quite random.\"\nOf course, it would sound weird to them since, unlike on Earth, they don't take children on trips for fun. They only travel if there is a contest or something.\n\"I think a trip would help them forget about what has happened in the past few weeks and reconnect with themselves. I mean, it would work for me.\"\nPhilius glanced at Hayden, and the Vice-headmaster shrugged, \"He knows better than us what the children like these days.\" Truthfully, Hayden was thinking of arranging a battle royale or something. But well, this would work too.\nPhilius nodded, \"Okay then, I will discuss it with a few teachers before relaying it to the students.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- A trip to the mountains with his beloved.

      "content": "Averis felt… uneasy. The sudden rush of voices, the crowd, the attention—it was all too much.\nUntil recently, she had lived far from people, tucked away in quiet solitude with only books for company. Her world had been still and silent, untouched by the chaos of everyday life.\nThen one day, her brother came crashing back into it—apologizing, insisting, urging her to take the entrance exams for the Valorian Academy.\nShe didn't agree because of him. She did it because… she was bored. Yes, that's was the reason!\n...probably.\nSomehow, she passed the physical trial. And thanks to all the hours spent reading—everything from ancient history to strange love stories—she scored the highest in the written exams. That alone earned her a spot in the prestigious Apex Circle.\nShe hadn't expected much from school. Having lived in the shadows for so long, she figured she could slip by unnoticed. Even when her brother was killed in court, cold and public, she hadn't stepped forward. She believed no one would remember her.\nBut she was wrong.\nSo, so wrong.\n\"Your hair is so pretty.\"\n\"Nee~ are you really not the crowned princess yet?\"\n\"Do you like sweet things, Averis? Want to get lunch together?\"\n\"Ahh~ your eyes are so pretty.\"\nShe was surrounded.\nHalf the class hovered around her, talking to her like they'd known her for years.\nShe didn't hate them. They weren't being cruel. They weren't prying too deep or trying to hurt her.\nBut the constant chatter… the endless questions… it was starting to wear her down.\n'Enough.'\nShe was just about to stand, ready to shatter the calm, gentle image they seemed to believe—ready to say something, anything—when a voice rang out,\n\"Leave her alone. She clearly isn't enjoying all this attention.\"\nIt was a firm, commanding voice that cut through the noise, sharp enough to make everyone fall silent and turn toward its source.\nA boy stood at the edge of the group—black hair, furrowed brows, and eyes the color of deep teal. His gaze was steady, cutting through the crowd with quiet authority.\nAveris recognized him immediately. She had seen him during the physical assessment. He was the best among the twenty-five participants—his name had topped the list.\n\"There's a difference,\" he said coolly, \"between being friendly and being a nuisance. She clearly isn't comfortable with all this noise and questioning.\"\nOne of the boys scoffed, folding his arms. \"Just say you're jealous, commoner. That she doesn't give someone like you the time of day—\"\n\"You're Jimmy, right?\" Averis suddenly stood, cutting off the boy mid-sentence. Her voice was calm, yet clear enough to turn heads. \"Would you mind sharing lunch with me?\"\nThe entire group froze.\nEven Jimmy blinked in surprise, as if unsure he'd heard her right.\n\"M-Me?\" he stammered, caught completely off guard. \"Y-Yeah. I'd love to.\"\n\"Good,\" she replied, already stepping around her desk. \"Lead the way.\"\nThough still stunned, Jimmy didn't hesitate to turn and walk toward the door. Averis followed closely behind, leaving the classroom in complete silence.\n\"…What just happened?\" someone finally muttered.\nAveris didn't look back. She just let out a long breath, pressing a hand to her chest as they walked. The space, the quiet—it felt like air after drowning.\n\"You okay?\" Jimmy asked, glancing sideways and instantly averting his gaze upon seeing her pat her chest.\nAgh...she didn't catch his peeking, right?\nShe nodded. \"Yeah… I'm better now. Thanks for stepping in.\"\nHe smiled gently. He knew she wasn't really asking him to lunch out of interest—she just needed a way out. Still, he didn't mind.\n\"Well,\" he said, tucking his hands into his pockets, \"since we're both heading to the common hall anyway, want to walk there together?\"\nAveris gave a small shrug, and the two stepped into the common hall together.\nIt was only their first day, but the sheer energy inside was overwhelming.\nThe space buzzed with noise and motion, packed with students laughing, shouting, and darting between tables.\n\"Woah…\" Jimmy muttered, eyes wide. \"This feels like a mini carnival.\"\nIt wasn't far from the truth. Since it was the start of the term, nearly every student had shown up—meeting friends, exploring the updated menu, soaking in the excitement of a new beginning.\nAveris exhaled softly. \"Let's find a seat first.\"\nThey weaved through the chaos, dodging elbows, bags, and the occasional tray, nearly spilling soup.\nAfter a bit of effort, they found a small table tucked near the far side—empty and thankfully quieter.\n\"You sit here,\" Jimmy said. \"I'll grab our lunch.\"\nAveris glanced toward the crowded counters and quickly nodded. \"Avoid beans, corn, and milk.\"\nJimmy laughed under his breath as he walked away. There it was—that little trace of royalty in her tone, careful and composed. Princess or not, he didn't mind.\nLeft alone, Averis let her eyes drift across the noisy hall.\nThis was the same place where her brother and sister-in-law used to study. They had spent nearly two and a half years here. Laughing. Training. Planning their future.\nShe tried to spot familiar faces in the crowd, but the constant motion, the noise—it was too much. Her thoughts wouldn't stay still.\nAt a nearby table, a group of students was chatting loudly. Words like \"the border clash,\" \"reinforcements,\" and \"casualties\" floated to her ears.\nAveris stiffened.\nShe turned her head quickly, pretending not to hear, but the damage was done.\nHer heartbeat faltered, not from fear, but from something deeper.\nThe images came uninvited.\nHer brother's tired, empty eyes.\nValerie's pale, trembling hands.\nSebastian's lifeless body, cold and broken.\nThe war had carved through her family like a blade—and yet, here they were, laughing about it like it was some story in the news.\n'How can they talk about something so horrible like it's just… casual conversation?'\nOnly those who've never lost someone in the line of fire can speak of war with such ease. Only those untouched by grief can treat it like gossip.\nAveris looked down at the table and placed her hands in her lap, willing her thoughts to quiet.\nShe just wanted this day to end.\n\"Hey, you okay?\"\nThe gentle voice pulled Averis from her thoughts. She blinked and turned to her left, finding Jimmy standing there, holding two trays and wearing a worried expression.\n\"Yes, I'm fine,\" she said quietly, scooting to the side so he could sit.\nJimmy set the trays down with a sigh. \"Man… that was hectic,\" he muttered, rubbing the back of his neck. \"People were swarming like it was the last meal on planet. Even the chef was rushing like he was handing out liquid gold or something.\"\nAveris shook her head. \"This is madness…\"\nThe crowd was too loud, too chaotic—an endless blur of noise and movement that made her want to disappear.\nShe glanced at the tray he brought her. A sandwich, a brownie, and some sliced fruit.\n\"I couldn't get anything to drink,\" Jimmy said, already taking a bite of his pancake.\nShe gave a small nod in acknowledgment but didn't respond. Her nerves were fraying again. The buzz of voices, the clatter of dishes, the shrieks of laughter—it was all crawling under her skin.\n'I should've stayed in my room…'\nShe picked up the sandwich, thinking she'd eat quickly and leave.\nBut then—everything went still.\nNot just in her head. The entire room fell quiet.\nShe froze, halfway through her first bite, and turned to Jimmy. He was staring toward the entrance with his lips slightly parted—the piece of pancake half hanging out.\nHer brows furrowed. \"What is it?\"\nShe followed his gaze—\n—and understood immediately.\nThe crowd had shifted, parting to create a wide, open path down the center of the hall. The kind of space that didn't happen naturally. It was the kind carved out by awe, curiosity, or fear.\nAt the far end of it, someone was walking in.\nA man.\nThe man.\nWhispers about him had filled the Academy since orientation. Stories, rumors, tales of what he'd done, what he might do. He was already a legend—and not necessarily a comforting one.\nBeside him walked a girl—his fiancée. The other half of the reason for the silence. Beautiful, composed, and sharp as glass, she matched his presence perfectly.\nNeither of them spared the crowd a glance.\nHe didn't even look at the space parting for him—his eyes never left the girl at his side. As if she were the only thing that existed in his world.\nAustin, who was walking with his beloved's hand in his hand, suddenly noticed something in the corner of his eye.\nA beautiful shade of silver.\nHe turned towards her, and there she was.\n\"Averis.\" He called out and approached the seat with Valerie beside him.\nEveryone turned towards the Princess, and the poor girl continuously shook her head, saying, 'Don't come near!' She was already being tortured a lot.\nAustin maybe intentionally ignored her plea and stood before her, \"You have settled in-hmm?\" Austin suddenly frowned, seeing the boy beside her, sitting closely.\nA little too close\nAveris could read his thoughts as she instantly said, \"Just a classmate!\"\nValerie chuckled, seeing her reaction.\nMeanwhile, Austin kept glaring at Jimmy, making the latter rethink his life decisions already.\nIn a heavy voice, Austin told him, \"Only someone stronger than me can be her partner.\"\n\"....\" (Averis)\nJust kill her already!!\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Austin's brotherly instincts tingled, and he made his point clear.",

      "content": "\"Was there really a need to threaten the boy?\" Valerie asked softly, her voice barely above a whisper as they lay together on the bed, naturally, in Austin's room.\nHer habit of sneaking into the boys' dorm hadn't changed in the slightest. And honestly, since she always slept best next to him, why should she stop?\nAustin gently ran his fingers along her back, the touch slow and calming. \"He needs to understand,\" he said, \"that my sister isn't someone he can win over so easily. If he's serious, then he should struggle for her… maybe even feel a little pain.\"\nValerie smiled at his protective tone. She rested her chin on his chest and looked up at him, her eyes meeting the calm depth of his aquamarine ones.\n\"My Lord is adorable,\" she whispered, placing a soft kiss on his chin.\nAustin blinked, caught off guard. \"Where did that come from?\"\nShe shrugged, a playful spark in her eyes. \"I just felt like it.\" Her lips curled into a grin. Even now, it never failed to amuse her how easily he got flustered when she praised him out of the blue.\nFor a moment, the room was quiet, filled only with the sound of their breathing and the warmth they shared.\nThen she spoke again, her voice gentle. \"So… how did things go with the Headmaster?\"\nAustin had gone to see the Headmaster that morning, while Valerie was busy chatting with the other council members.\nTomorrow was the selection day for new officers and first-year council members. That's why both she—and, to her surprise, even Austin—had been called to the office after school.\nJust the thought of working alongside him as a senior officer made her heart flutter.\nEven today, watching how people looked at him—with respect, with admiration—filled her with quiet pride. So much had changed. Just a few months ago, whispers followed him wherever he went. People called him useless. Said he didn't deserve her.\nAnd now, believe it or not, Valerie overheard someone whispering that she wasn't worthy to stand beside him.\nThat made her… happy. And just a little angry.\n\"We just talked about some casual things,\" Austin said, his voice calm. \"He was worried about me… said I should rely on my wife a little more.\"\nValerie's eyes narrowed as she looked up at him. \"He was absolutely right. Rely on me more.\" A bold declaration—especially coming from the girl whose entire body weight was resting comfortably on her lover.\nAustin chuckled and patted her head, softening her stern gaze. \"Alright, I'll rely on Valerie more. There, there.\"\n\"Mm…\" she hummed in satisfaction, leaning deeper into his touch. Moments like this… they're too peaceful to let go.\nAfter a quiet pause, he added, \"He also accepted one of my suggestions—something to lift the students' spirits.\"\nValerie raised her brows with interest. \"Oh? And what did you suggest?\"\n\"That's a surprise,\" he said with a teasing smile. \"If he picks my idea, then I'll tell you.\"\nValerie frowned slightly, her curiosity fully piqued. What could it be? A contest? A dungeon raid?\nShe couldn't have known then, but the week ahead would become far more special than anything she could have imagined.\n-------**-------\n[Next Day]\nSheldon sat in the chair that once belonged to someone he loved.\nAnabelle had already graduated, leaving the Council—and its responsibilities—in his hands.\nAlthough Sheldon always felt that Valerie was the better leader between the two of them, both women had been stubborn in their decision. They wanted him to be the next president. And there was no arguing with them when they had that look in their eyes.\nSo here he was, doing his best to manage everything. Thankfully, since he'd served as Vice-President the previous year, the other officers had accepted his promotion without much resistance.\nNow, seated in the large cushioned chair at the back of the room, Sheldon watched the four new recruits standing before him.\n\"Introduce yourselves,\" came a sharp voice beside him.\nIt was the new Vice-President—Travis, a second-year student with a reputation for being intense. Always serious. Always stern.\nTwo of the four students visibly flinched at his tone. Sheldon let out a quiet sigh.\nThis guy seriously needs to relax.\nThe one on the far left, a girl with long black hair and striking red eyes, stepped forward stiffly.\n\"Helena. First year. Apex Circle,\" she said, her voice sharp but nervous.\nNext was a guy with glasses and a mess of bushy brown hair, \"Rex, first year, Apex Circle, sir!\" He straightened up, clearly trying to sound confident, though his voice wavered.\nThe third spoke more casually, with a neutral tone.\n\"Jimmy. First year. Apex Circle.\"\nAnd then the fourth... well, Sheldon already knew her.\n\"Averis. First Year. Apex Circle,\" she said without hesitation, offering a small glance at Sheldon that he carefully ignored.\nTravis, standing beside the president, stepped forward with his usual cold demeanor.\n\"Based on your academic and physical assessments, you've been summoned here. You will be tested before any roles are assigned.\"\nHis voice was firm, nearly mechanical.\n\"Two of you will work under the Disciplinary Department, one under the Treasurer, and one under the Management Division. Any questions?\"\nJimmy tentatively raised his hand.\n\"Go ahead,\" Travis said, tone neutral but eyes sharp.\n\"Can I choose which department I work for?\" Jimmy asked.\n\"You can't,\" came the immediate reply. \"Your skills will determine whether you're even worth being here.\"\nThe blunt answer made Helena swallow hard, her fingers tightening at her sides.\nSheldon let out a breath. If he didn't step in soon, Travis was going to crush what little confidence these newcomers had.\nHe leaned forward, interlacing his fingers as he spoke with calm authority.\n\"Look,\" he began, voice steady, \"there are many who want to work in the Council. Being chosen as one of the first candidates doesn't guarantee you a permanent position. That's why we test you.\"\nHe looked each of them in the eye, trying to ease the pressure just enough without sugarcoating reality.\n\"A lot of students dream of having a seat at this table. There are benefits, yes, but there are also expectations. It's your effort and results that earned you this chance. Now it's up to you to prove you deserve it.\"\nA beat of silence followed. He could see the tension ease just a little in their shoulders.\nSheldon sat back, giving them a small, encouraging nod.\n\"Let's see what you've got.\"\nJust then, the doors to the office opened, and every council member—except for the four new recruits—turned their heads toward the two figures who entered.\nA quiet tension filled the room, only broken as the senior members rose slightly or nodded in greeting. Travis quickly straightened his back the moment he saw who it was—the Disciplinary Chief had arrived.\n\"Ah, you finally made it,\" Sheldon said, his tone casual as Austin and Valerie approached his desk.\nAustin paused mid-step and turned slightly to glance at the four first-years standing off to the side.\nA faint smile played on his lips.\nAveris glanced at him briefly… and then quickly looked away, keeping her expression stern and unreadable.\nDon't mess up her serious mode now!\nHis gaze shifted to the boy standing next to her. Austin narrowed his eyes slightly as he studied him.\nAs I thought… he's skilled.\nThe boy's stance was disciplined—shoulders squared, back straight, a subtle tension in his muscles. There weren't many openings in his posture. Austin could already tell: this one didn't grow up with ease. From the look of his rugged build and raw focus, he'd likely clawed his way into the academy.\nA commoner who fought his way to the academy.\n\"Alright then,\" Sheldon clapped his hands lightly, \"let's head to the training field.\"\n\"Wh-Why?\" Rex stammered, a nervous edge in his voice and a pale look settling over his face.\nSheldon raised a brow, blinking as if the answer was obvious. \"For your assessment, of course. Come on, don't waste time.\"\n...\nThey shifted locations.\nTo check whether a person could handle the job of being a disciplinarian, they must assess their skills in different situations.\nSince the inform gymnasium wasn't booked by the Council, there were many other students who came to watch the trials.\nSheldon didn't focus on them and stood before the four.\nGlancing at Valerie, I wordlessly asked her to take charge.\nBeing the head of the department, she has a better understanding of how to test them.\nThe violette stepped toward the ground and stood there with a stern look on her face.\n\"The duty of a committee member is to ensure that no student breaks the rules, interfere if a battle breaks out, and defuse a situation as soon as you can.\"\nSweeping her eyes over the group she made sure her words were heard.\nUnfolding her arms, she said, \"Let's begin.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Austin definitely won't ask Jimmy to fight him as a trial. Definitely.\nThanks for reading. Drop a comment.",

      "content": "\"Haah… haah…\"\nJimmy's breath came out in ragged gasps as he darted through the narrow path carved between towering ice pillars.\nHe didn't know what kind of challenge he might have to face, that's why the best tactic was to not let his position become obvious, which would allow the enemy to easily strike him down.\nThis was the third—and final—test.\nIt was designed to push every candidate to their limits, to see how well they could react in the face of a sudden ambush or disaster. The Disciplinary Chief had personally created this frozen maze, with massive ice spikes rising all over the training ground, cutting off vision and narrowing movement.\nEach participant had to carry a training doll, meant to represent an injured student. The goal: protect the 'victim' and reach the safe zone without getting tagged by any of the traps or patrols hidden within.\nJimmy's arms tightened around the doll. He had to move carefully now. He was at the final stage—and one mistake would ruin everything.\nAveris had already made her choice. She stopped after the second round, satisfied with a position as a regular officer.\nThe others also decided not to push themselves any further since in this challenge, they wouldn't know when they would be hit.\nBut not Jimmy.\nHe wasn't here to settle.\nHe wanted the top.\nAnd this was his chance to prove he deserved it.\nThump.\nSCREEECH.\nA loud crash echoed behind Jimmy, followed by the sharp, skin-crawling sound of metal scraping against ice.\nSomething-or someone—had landed close.\nToo close.\nJimmy didn't stop to look. He couldn't afford to. His legs pumped harder, feet slamming against the frozen ground as he weaved through the icy maze. The sharp turns, the narrow gaps—it all blurred. He had one goal:\nReach the safe zone.\nHe clutched the training dummy tighter, pretending it was a real person. Someone injured. Someone depends on him.\nHe was not desperate to reach the top, but to show that he didn't ace the practical exams by luck. And for that, he must remain focused.\nBut then—he glanced back.\nA shadow.\nIt moved between the pillars, silent, smooth, and getting closer.\nJimmy cursed under his breath and turned sharply—\n\"Stop running already.\"\n\"Ugh!\"\nHe slammed straight into someone.\nHis body bounced off and hit the ground with a hard thud. The training doll nearly slipped from his grasp as he landed on his butt, groaning.\nHe looked up.\nAnd froze.\nHim.\nThe new Hero.\nThe one people whispered about. The one who took down a Demon General like it was nothing.\nJimmy's hands trembled as he pushed himself up. His back burned, and his breath came in quick bursts. But his scythe was already in his hand, glowing faintly, and he shifted into a stance.\nHe wasn't going to back down.\nNot even now.\nThe dummy was still cradled in his arms. He'd fight if he had to. Or run. Whichever got him through.\nAustin stood there, relaxed. Too relaxed. One hand in his pocket, the other loose by his side. His gaze was calm, almost bored.\n\"You wish to fight me, huh?\"\nHis voice was cold, smooth, like he wasn't talking to an opponent, but a fly buzzing in his ear.\nJimmy's grip tightened. His legs were tense, ready to spring at the first opening.\n\"You must be pretty confident in yourself,\" Jimmy said, trying to sound brave. But the words came out shaky, like a bitter laugh aimed at himself.\nOf course, he was confident.\nHe ended a war.\nAnd Jimmy?\nHe was just trying to survive a test.\n\"Look, there's an easy way to end this. The painless way,\" Austin said calmly, his voice echoing across the frozen spikes.\nAs he spoke, two silver hammers shimmered into existence in his hands.\nJimmy blinked.\nHammers?\nWasn't his Shard a dagger? Or maybe a sword?\nWhat was this guy?\nAustin didn't stop. He stepped forward, slow and certain.\n\"Give me the hostage, and I'll let you go. If you don't...\"\nTHUMP.\nHe slammed one hammer into the ground. The ice cracked under its weight, and a shockwave rippled out—Jimmy stumbled, barely keeping his grip on the dummy.\nThat wasn't just for show.\n\"...then you know what happens next.\"\nJimmy's breath hitched.\nHe looked past Austin—there.\nA gap in the wall of ice. An opening.\nJust a few meters.\nThat was all he needed. A few meters, and he'd be out.\nBut those few meters might as well have been a hundred.\nBecause standing between him and escape was a monster in human skin.\nJimmy's heart pounded. Sweat clung to his forehead.\nHe wasn't stupid—he knew he couldn't win. Not against him.\nHe might have been weak in the past, but this war has changed many things. And just out of curiosity, Jimmy wasn't going to check if Austin really lives up to those rumors.\nFor him, this wasn't about winning.\nIt was about survival.\nAnd keeping the \"injured\" hostage safe.\nHe had to think. Outsmart him. Trick him.\nBecause of brute strength? That wouldn't save him here.\nNot today.\nJimmy's mouth moved.\nAustin narrowed his eyes. Something about it felt off.\nThat wasn't a nervous twitch.\nHe's planning something.\n\"This ends here,\" Austin stepped forward, but that one inch was all Jimmy needed.\nPtuh!\nJimmy spat out whatever he had been chewing.\nA pair of slimy, pulsing orbs flew through the air, and the moment they hit the ground—\nBOOM!\nThey burst.\nAnd then—\nDarkness.\nPitch black, thick and choking. Like a blanket thrown over the world. Austin's vision vanished instantly, and the cold from the ice walls felt even sharper now that sight had abandoned him.\nThe battlefield was swallowed whole.\nJimmy's trap had sprung.\nHe bolted forward, pouring every last drop of strength into his sprint.\nHis plan was simple—don't fight, just run.\nGet past him. Get out.\nHis heart pounded, chest tight, his breath short. The exit was there, so close he could taste it.\n'Just a little more—Agh!'\nSuddenly, his body jerked backward.\nHis collar was caught.\nHe didn't think—he reacted.\nWith a desperate growl, Jimmy hurled the hostage toward the glowing light ahead, toward freedom.\nBut—\nTUNG!\nThe doll slammed against an invisible wall, and a shimmering barrier sparked to life, humming with magic.\nJimmy froze.\nThat was it.\nHe lost.\nValerie snapped her fingers, and the towering ice spikes around them crumbled into mist.\nThe results were expected, but a quiet wave of disappointment swept through the audience. Many had hoped to witness a miracle—a first-year pulling off the impossible.\nAustin let go of Jimmy's collar and asked gently, \"You good?\"\nThe boy looked like he was on the verge of breaking. His breaths were shaky, his pride bruised.\nJimmy closed his eyes for a moment, then exhaled deeply. \"Yeah. I'm fine. Just... not used to losing.\"\nAustin gave a small nod. \"With how many plans you usually cook up, I'm not surprised. You don't strike me as someone who loses often.\"\nJimmy didn't answer, but the compliment was clear.\nHe understood the situation right away. Close combat in a tight space, while guarding a hostage, was a trap. That's why he hadn't hesitated to look for a way out from the very beginning.\nSmart. But not enough—not this time.\n\"You did well, Jimmy. I didn't expect anyone to push Austin to use his barrier,\" Sheldon said with genuine appreciation, making Austin grumble under his breath.\nEven Austin hadn't expected to bring out the Absolute Barrier during a simple assessment.\nValerie gave a gentle smile. \"You did well, my Lord,\" she said, her voice soft but proud.\nAustin smiled....and so did Jimmy.\n\"Hey, she didn't praise you,\" Austin complained, ready to summon God's Wrath again.\nJimmy gave an apologetic smile.\n\"I'll assign your role tomorrow,\" Sheldon continued. \"Meet me before class.\"\nWith that, the group began to disperse. It was already dinner time, and everyone was ready to return to their rooms.\nBut just as Austin turned to leave, a voice rang out.\n\"Senior Austin… can I ask why you didn't use your Shard?\"\nEveryone stopped.\nEven those already a few steps away turned around, curiosity clear in their eyes. Other than Valerie and Rhea, no one had seen Austin's Shard in action.\nNaturally, they were interested.\nAustin glanced back over his shoulder, locking eyes with the boy. His answer came without hesitation.\n\"Because I didn't want you to surrender right away.\"\n\"…\"\nSilence spread through the ground like a slow wave.\nAveris gave a soft scoff while the others just remained standing in silence.\nIt didn't even feel arrogant—just factual. And that made it even more chilling.\nHis reputation had already painted him as someone dangerous.\nBut now?\nNow, everyone was asking the same question:\n'Just what kind of power does he hold?'\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- You better not find out or you might drop out.

      "content": "Averis let out a quiet sigh as she sat beside Jimmy in the common hall.\nHe was the only one who didn't constantly bring up her family or ask about her brother. That was why she didn't mind being around him. With him, there was no pressure—just silence she could breathe in.\n\"It was… a bit too much,\" she muttered, nudging a lone pea around her plate.\nJimmy, seated across from her, answered almost right away. \"The assessment? I thought it was fair.\"\nHis voice was calm, but his eyes told a different story—one shaped by memories too heavy for most.\nHe had seen real bloodshed. Demons had torn through his hometown with no warning, no mercy. They didn't wait for backup or choose their targets. Everyone was fair game. The old, the young, the innocent. It didn't matter.\nSo when he watched today's assessment, he didn't flinch. To him, it was a small taste—just a glimpse—of what was out there. The real world didn't give second chances. It crushed those who weren't ready.\nToday's test wasn't about passing or failing. It was about surviving. About seeing who could still stand when the fear sank in.\nJimmy hoped he had stood tall enough. That somehow, today, proved he wasn't just another survivor, but someone others could count on.\n\"Your dedication makes me feel like I'm just here to have fun,\" Averis said dryly, finishing the last of her milk. It was sweet and smooth, comforting in a way that didn't match the thoughts stirring in her chest.\nJimmy blinked, caught off guard. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way…\"\n\"No, it's fine,\" she cut in gently, shaking her head. \"I'm not blaming you. It's just… when I see how hard you've fought to get here, how much you've been through, I realize how different our paths have been. I had everything handed to me. You had to earn every step.\"\nJimmy stared at her, genuinely surprised.\nHe'd heard things—stories about royals being proud, cold, and unreachable. But Averis? She felt different. She didn't put herself above anyone. Instead, she noticed people's efforts, gave credit where it was due, and openly admitted her own flaws.\n\"You… you're actually a really sweet person,\" he said, the words slipping out before he could stop them.\nAveris froze, her hand halting mid-motion as the pea dropped from her spoon and rolled across her plate.\nJimmy's eyes widened. He immediately looked away, clearing his throat and trying to play it off.\n'…What the hell am I saying?'\n....\n\"Haah… haah…\"\nRhea panted heavily, sweat sliding down her forehead as her eyes scanned the training ground—eyes filled with disappointment.\nOnly thirty broken. In half an hour.\nTo her, it wasn't enough. Not even close.\nWhat she didn't see—what she couldn't see—was how far she had already come in such a short time.\nMonths ago, when she was valay strolling here, she had watched Valerie storm through the training ground, tearing through training dummies like paper, venting her frustration with a strength that left Rhea in awe. Back then, she hadn't even managed to crack a single one.\nAnd now… she stood amidst the remains of thirty broken dummies. Now, she had power.\nNow, she was someone who didn't need protecting.\nNo one would have to come running to save her ever again.\n\"Done with training?\"\n\"Eiip!\"\nShe let out a startled yelp, jumping slightly at the sudden voice beside her.\nClutching her chest, she turned to glare at the source. \"Could you not sneak up like that? A little warning, maybe?\"\nAustin let out a soft chuckle. \"You were too busy admiring your progress to notice me.\"\n\"I wasn't admiring anything,\" she muttered, turning away. \"I was scolding myself.\"\nAustin's smile faded as he stepped closer, his gaze falling to her bruised, scraped knuckles. He sighed. \"You couldn't have gone any further with those hands.\"\nRhea glanced down at them, her fingers slightly trembling, blood staining the wraps that failed to protect her skin.\nShe had a Shard—long-range, precise. But she hadn't used it. Not once. She chose to fight up close, ignoring strategy, ignoring pain. It wasn't training anymore—it was something else.\nA way to forget. A way to feel something.\nA way to hurt… and be hurt.\nAustin's voice softened. \"Beating yourself up for what happened...I don't believe you are venting in the right place.\"\nRhea didn't answer right away. Her eyes stayed fixed on her bruised, bloodied fists.\n\"I don't have many options left,\" she muttered at last, voice low. \"The demons have gone into hiding… and I can't exactly go around beating up criminals just to let off steam.\"\nShe let out a tired sigh, shoulders sinking ever so slightly.\nAustin gave a small chuckle. \"So much aggression. Why not take it out on your juniors or something? Start your own reign of terror.\"\nRhea let out a dry laugh, almost bitter. \"And become the kind of person I once stood up against?\"\nThat silenced him.\nHe remembered. That day had come up between them not too long ago—the day Rudolph fell for her. When she stood alone, not backing down, even when it hurt.\nBack then, she had fought against injustice, on her own\nThe memory lingered in the air between them, settling like dust in sunlight. Heavy, unspoken.\nThen, after a quiet beat, Rhea asked, her voice softer, unsure, \"Would you stop talking to me if I forgive Parkinson?\"\nAustin blinked.\nParkinson.\nThe name pulled up a tangle of memories. That boy had been there during the chaos, fighting beside Rhea, standing his ground when Valerie fell. He had protected them both.\nBack then he was a threat that's why Austin got rid of him. But now...he doesn't bother him.\nAustin thought about it for a second, then spoke simply, without weight or judgment.\n\"It's your call. I don't mind.\"\nBecause deep down, he knew: Parkinson didn't commit the crime he was blamed for.\n\"It's not like I am going to meet him or something...but the next time I see him, I might not be able to push him away.\"\nAustin hummed, \"Whatever seems the best for you.\"\nRhea glanced at him, his expression was neutral. In these moments, boys like to comfort girls...but he isn't like that. He couldn't become compassionate for anyone but Valerie.\nAnd maybe, that's the reason why Rhea could share all her grief with him. Knowing he wouldn't care much.\n\"Thank you, Austin.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thank you for reading. These chapters would mostly be SOL. The next arc would be the second-last arc of the story.",

      "content": "\"Young Lord, it's about time.\"\n\"Ah!\" Austin woke up from his slumber, his chest heaving as he turned his head to the left.\nAll he saw was empty space...even though he felt he heard him.\nHis heart was restless, a not-so-rare occurrence these days.\nAfter the war, this was the seventh time he heard Sebastian's voice, waking him up...but there was no one.\nIt was one of his regular habits to wake Austin up for his morning training...the man never failed to wake up earlier than Austin.\nAnd now, it still feels that he was around...looking after him from the afterlife. Smiling brightly...proudly.\n\"Haah...\" Austin got up and sat at the edge of the bed. His eyes were on the ground, and his hands were clutching the sheet.\nHe hasn't told anyone about it. What could be said? Everyone who has seen the war was traumatized...recovering from the incident, which has changed many people.\nAustin was not immune to it as well. He was a human, too, after all.\nHe didn't know how his other version handled himself seeing such bloodshed, or whether he had ever lost someone close to him. However, the current him was shaken up.\nThe grief of losing Sebastian wasn't leaving him.\n'I need a bath...' Deciding to engage himself in something else, he dove into the warm pool inside the bathroom, after stripping off his clothes.\nOnce inside, he rested his head against the edge and asked the system, \"How are you today?\"\n[Still beautiful as ever.]\nShe chimed, her voice lively as ever.\nAustin chuckled, \"You chose to switch to serious mode when you have to reject my requests and inform me of something unfortunate.\"\n[Can't let my actual voice become a source of despair for the host.]\nShe seemed quite talkative today. Well, he wanted to talk.\nValerie must be training at the moment, all by herself,, since Austin told her that he wouldn't come.\nHe said he might sleep in today and will see her in class. But now, it was only near dawn, so he was thinking of going and meeting his lover.\nSilence descended in the bathroom, with the only sound heard being the ripples of water as Austin shifted his body slightly.\nThere was a brief pause before Austin asked, \"System… is there a way to reverse time or something?\"\nEven as the words left his mouth, he knew how absurd they sounded. He hadn't really thought it through—he just said it on impulse. But deep down, he already knew the answer.\nThere was no way.\nNot even for the system—the same system that had given him abilities beyond imagination—could turn back time.\n…Right?\nSystem? he asked again, frowning as the silence stretched on.\nNo response.\nA minute passed before a familiar bundle of light shimmered into view in front of him. Wordlessly, Austin reached out.\n\"You okay?\" he asked softly.\nThis was only the second time she had ever appeared to him. The first was back in that dungeon, when he was broken and hopeless.\nBut now… it was different.\nNow, she looked like the one who was broken.\nShe had no face, no eyes or mouth, but Austin could tell—she was hurting. Grieving.\nThe orbs of golden light shifted gently, as though she was lifting her head to meet his gaze.\nA message appeared before him.\n[Words can't describe how much I want to help you. But when your friends become the obstacles… there's nothing I can do.]\nShe rarely ever used \"I.\" It only happened when she wasn't speaking as the system… but as herself.\nAustin sat there, not sure what to say. He didn't even fully understand what she meant. But something in her unsteady voice pushed the words out of him.\n\"It's not your fault,\" he said quietly. \"We'll get through this… somehow.\"\nShe said nothing.\nSo he inched closer and pulled the bundle of light into a gentle embrace.\nHe didn't know what she really was—an ancient being, a guardian, or something else entirely. Maybe she was just a presence hiding behind the system screen.\nBut one thing he did know:\nShe was his closest, most loyal ally.\nThe one who had never let go, no matter how bad things got.\nSomeone he could trust with everything.\n.....\n[Inside the classroom]\n\"Are you sure you're okay?\" Valerie asked again—the second time since morning.\nShe couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about him. It wasn't the usual signs—he still smiled, he still laughed, but...\nIt was the way he drifted, like his body was there, but part of him wasn't.\nLike she was talking to someone standing in front of her, yet their heart was somewhere far away.\nHow could she explain it?\nAustin gave her a warm smile, gentle and familiar. \"It's nothing big,\" he said softly. \"If it was, you know I wouldn't hide it from you.\"\nValerie was silenced. If he was saying so...she should trust him.\n\"Hey, are you free after this?\" Sheldon, who was sitting on a seat in front of them, asked after turning over his shoulder.\nAustin nodded, \"Yeah...need help with another assessment?\"\nSheldon shook his head, a bit of hesitation could be sensed from him, before he revealed, \"Actually, Anna's birthday is coming...so I was thinking of buying a gift. Can you help me select one?\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Lady's department? I am an expert in that.\"\nValerie blinked and turned towards her husband, wide-eyed.\nAustin realized that he might have made a wrong move, declaring that based on his experience as Luke.\nHe softly smiled at her, a bit awkwardly, when the doors parted, the teacher walked into the classroom.\n\"Okay, students. Good news.\" She said as soon as she took the podium.\nAustin found a perfect distraction, so he urged her, \"Come on, let's hear what it is.\"\nValerie wasn't thrilled.\nNot a bit.\nBut still, she turned towards the teacher, and everyone heard her saying,\n\"For the first time, our school has arranged a fun activity for the students.\" With a grin, she added, \"We are going to the beach!\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Ah yeah, the classic swimsuit episode.

      "content": "A beach trip. Valerie didn't expect that.\nShe knew that since her lover had advised the Headmaster, he must have been considerate and mindful of what everyone actually needed rather than what they usually demand.\nAnd a fun trip without any purpose and without any requirement of preparations, would help them reconnect with themselves.\nShe knew she was going to enjoy herself there since any place becomes beautiful when he is there with her.\nHowever, there was a matter of concern.\nSwimsuit.\nShe was standing before her wardrobe, unsure what she should do.\nShe has never even once bought a single swimsuit. She never needed one.\nThe only swimsuit she had in her closet was something her mother bought when she was just six. At that time, she went to the hot springs.\nHowever, naturally, wearing something so small never crossed her mind.\n'What should I do?' She wanted to choose a swimsuit that would make her lover all flustered and impressed at the same time. She wanted to make him look at her, not anyone else but her.\n'He must have seen girls in swimsuits before...' Her face turned gloomy at the thought of his ex-girlfriends...would she be able to make the deepest impression?\nHer clouding thoughts were dispersed as she heard a few knocks on the door,\n*Knock*\nShe closed the wardrobe and approached the door.\n*Click*\n\"Hmm?\" Her brows elevated upon seeing two familiar figures standing there\n\"I want to ask for your help,\" Averis said, entering the room without being invited. Valerie didn't mind.\nShe invited the other person, knowing she wouldn't step inside otherwise.\n\"I was thinking if we could go shopping?\" Rhea suggested, the hesitation in her voice suggesting how awkward she still was around her.\n\"Oh?\" Valerie's brows elevated as she offered the pink head a chair and asked her sister-in-law first, \"What help do you need?\"\n\"You know I have locked myself away for the past few years, so now I don't have a single idea what the current trend in swimsuits is. So help me pick one.\"\n\"....\" Sister-in-law, you are asking the wrong person. Valerie, despite not being locked away, was feeling very outdated at the moment.\nRhea, somehow, understood Valerie's predicament, as she suggested, \"I was going to buy one too, so wanna join?\" She didn't show much hesitation now since they both seemed to be stuck in the same situation.\nValerie nodded, \"I'd love to. Avy, come with us.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n°°°°°°°\n\"Hmm? What does she like?\" Sheldon hummed, tilting his head after being questioned about his girlfriend's hobbies and favorite foods.\nAustin nodded. \"Yeah, instead of trying to be overly creative, just give her something she genuinely loves—something that speaks to her heart.\"\n\"Genuinely, being a daughter of a trader, I thought of giving her some gold coins.\"\n\"...\"\nAustin froze mid-step, turning to look at Sheldon with an expression that clearly said, 'Are you serious right now?'\nSheldon shrugged. \"I mean, you said something that goes with her lifestyle.\"\nAustin blinked, deadpan. \"Right. So if her family ran a bakery, would you have gifted her a sack of flour?\"\n\"Yeah?\" Sheldon asked with a shrug.\nAustin parted his lips but then decided not to say anything about it.\n\"Okay, tell me what she likes to do in her free days?\" He asked as they started walking again.\nThey were both gathering quite a lot of attention. Tall, handsome guys, wearing casual clothes, having a fun chat, laughing, and teasing while they walk. For some, they were a sight for sore eyes, and for some, they elicited a sigh of admiration.\n\"Hmm, she likes to make clay pots and sculptures?\" He said, remembering how he often found her in the small workshop she had created in her room.\nAustin hummed before asking, \"And what does she like to wear? The dress usually?\"\nSheldon narrowed his eyes, \"Why are you curious about that?\"\n\"...man, I am helping you select a gift. Did you forget?\"\n\"Oh, yeah...sorry.\" The silver head thought for a moment before responding, \"She likes to wear a one-piece strap dress. Light color.\"\nAustin nodded, \"Tell me her taste in food.\"\n\"Sweet, fluffy.\"\n\"She gives that vibe.\" Austin suddenly came to a pause before he told Sheldon, \"Can you bring her on the trip?\"\nSheldon was taken aback, \"She has graduated, you know that, right?\"\n\"I know, but she can be 'coincidentally' present there as a visitor, no?\"\nSheldon's brows elevated, \"Hmm~I never thought about it. Well, why do you want me to bring her over?\"\n\"You can make a cheesecake for her and spend the day with her?\" He suggested. He believed Sheldon would guess by now.\nSheldon scratched his head, \"I only know how to cook fish.\"\n\"And how many times have you cooked?\"\n\"One.\"\nFigured.\nAustin has taken a very difficult case today. Should've rather enjoyed the evening with his beloved.\n.....\nWhile on one side, Austin was struggling with Sheldon, the group of three beauties was wandering around the market.\nAveris and Rhea were chatting continuously, sharing their experiences and likes. Meanwhile, Valerie just followed them.\n\"You actually created wooden toys at such a young age?\" Rhea seemed surprised.\n\"I was good with knives and small blades.\" She shrugged.\nRhea chuckled, \"I somehow learned it and used to sell them years ago. Now I craft things to release some stress.\"\nAveris was aware of Rhea's circumstances, which is why she didn't react to that.\n\"There is a small shop here that sells crafting tools. Wanna check out?\" Rhea suggested, and Averis readily nodded, \"Sure.\"\nAs such, they walked towards a completely unrelated shop.\nJust as the duo were about to step inside, Valerie said, \"You go ahead, I will eat something.\" She hasn't had anything after lunch, and there was a rice ball shop nearby.\nRhea held a guilty smile as she suggested, \"We can go to the shop later. Should we search for the swimsuit first?\"\n\"No, it's okay. It's not often that you go shopping, isn't it?\" Valerie asked, taking Rhea off guard.\nShe....didn't expect Valerie to notice something like that.\nValerie held a soft smile and nodded, \"Go and enjoy yourselves. I will be nearby.\"\nRhea gave a soft nod before she entered the shop.\nValerie heaved a long sigh before she walked back to the store.\n\"What can I do for you, young lady?\" The shop owner asked as he moved his hand and prepared the filling.\nThe rich aroma of spices and the meat made her even more hungry.\nShe was about to order a few varieties when suddenly,\n\"Give her whatever she wants. It would be on me.\"\nValerie turned towards the source of the voice and found three men, clearly not with pure intentions, grinning at her.\nRolling her eyes, she muttered under her breath, 'Must this happen?'\n°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- It's a cliche set up. You can't run away from it. Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"Mistress, are you sure about this? The Parasite King was just killed… and the target regained his strength,\" said a voice inside a dimly lit room where only two figures shared the space.\nThe speaker, a male demon with long, slick fingers, was gently massaging the back of a stunningly beautiful woman. Her skin gleamed in the low light, her naked body relaxed across the bed, stretched out like a cat basking in warmth.\nShe let out a quiet hum, already aware of what he was saying.\nBut then, in a voice slow and heavy with pleasure, she replied, \"I can't wait anymore. If I do… I might never get the chance to touch him.\"\nHer tone was lazy, almost dreamy, as though she was far more focused on the hands gliding along her spine than the conversation itself.\nThe demon, her advisor for many years and a veteran of the long-past war, dared to speak again, \"But my lady… he's still too powerful. If you go alone… is it really wise—?\"\nCrack.\nHis voice caught in his throat as her fingers snapped around his tail, bones splintering under her grip.\nHe didn't move. Didn't scream. He just clenched his jaw and bore the pain, not daring to ruin her mood with another sound.\n\"Don't ruin my good time with useless chatter,\" she said coldly.\n\"U-Understood,\" he whispered.\nShe released his tail, and he resumed his massage silently, his fingers trembling ever so slightly.\nStill, she decided to answer him.\n\"Do you know the best time to break a couple apart?\" Her voice was low, playful now, laced with something darker.\nThe demon bowed his head, choosing his words with care. \"Please… enlighten this lowly servant, my lady.\"\nA soft laugh escaped her lips.\n\"It's when they haven't had their first night together. That's when they're still unsure… still vulnerable.\"\nShe rested her chin on her palm, her grin curling with wicked delight.\n\"And Luke is still not there yet.\"\nA glint of hunger flickered in her eyes as she murmured to herself, \"I know exactly what he likes. And if I really try… he won't be able to say no.\"\nThe demon, now quietly continuing his massage, let a grin curl across his lips.\n\"You wish to divide and dominate.\"\n\"That's right,\" the woman purred, her voice laced with wicked satisfaction. \"Take away that little lover, and Austin will fall apart. The only way to truly break him… is to ruin her.\"\nShe turned slightly, letting the soft sheets slide over her skin like silk.\n\"And if the Succubus Queen herself sets her sights on a man… not even the Gods could keep him safe.\"\n\"Undoubtedly,\" the demon agreed, his voice thick with reverence and a touch of fear.\nThis wasn't just a woman. She was the Demon General—Luke's former lover and one of the most dangerous beings still walking the lands.\nA slow, cruel grin spread across her lips as she tilted her head from side to side, eyes half-lidded with anticipation.\nThen, under her breath, she whispered,\n\"Just wait for me, my poor boy. I'll give you what your love never can…\"\n°°°°°°°°\nEarly in the morning, the front gate of the academy buzzed with quiet energy. Around two hundred students had gathered, their chatter mixing with the crisp breeze that swept across the grounds.\nThe academy could house six hundred students, but today, only a third had shown up. Many still hadn't returned after the last event, while others chose to stay back and focus on their studies.\nThere was no reward for participating in this activity—no credits, no special treatment—so the headmaster hadn't pushed anyone to join. It was purely voluntary.\nA handful of Professors and the Vice-headmaster remained at the academy, staying behind to help those who chose to continue with their lessons.\nAmong the group near the front stood Austin, silently beside Sheldon. They weren't talking. Just standing there, waiting.\nAustin wore a red checkered shirt with black trousers and solid boots, a mix of rugged and stylish that made him stand out. The shirt clung slightly to his frame, hinting at the strength beneath. His dark hair was slightly tousled by the wind, just messy enough to seem effortless.\nThere was something about him—calm, distant, yet striking. Like someone out of a dream who didn't quite know he belonged in one.\n\"Do I look weird?\" Sheldon suddenly asked.\nAustin glanced at him. Black trousers, black shirt, and a pair of sneakers. He shrugged, \"A little formal, but works.\"\n\"Seniors, do you want some fresh red bean dumplings?\" Two girls, probably from the first year, came rushing toward them with a smile on their faces.\nSheldon shook his head while Austin nodded, \"Yeah, thanks.\"\nTaking a bite, he exhaled a sigh, enjoying the rich flavor and softness of the dumpling.\nIt was then, his eyes landed on something far more sweeter than the dumpling.\nA goddess approached him, with her blue skirt brushing her thighs with every step, the fabric swaying gently in the breeze. A pair of simple sandals wrapped around her feet, light and elegant. Her hair was pulled back into a high ponytail, revealing the soft lines of her face.\nA touch of red lipstick brought warmth to her lips, subtle yet striking. She didn't need anything loud—her presence alone turned the moment into something breathtaking.\nNot only Austin, but many others were also staring at her in silence...completely swept by her grace.\nOnce she reached before him, she gently smiled and raised her brows to ask, 'How do I look?'\nAustin stuffed the dumpling to Sheldon before pulling her close, \"I really want to say a cheesy line here...but just like my breath, you have stolen my words too.\"\nA smile bloomed on her lips as she lowered her eyes, \"Tried something new. Glad you liked it.\"\nAustin kissed the back of her hand, before whispering, \"I might not release your hand for the whole journey, in the fear of someone taking you away.\"\nValerie gave an upturned glance, \"Then keep me tied to you. I'd love nothing more than that.\"\n°°°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. I was smiling near the end.",

      "content": "Students weren't told to sit by class year or by gender. It was a trip meant for fun, and so they were free to sit wherever they liked.\nNaturally, everyone formed their own little groups, squeezing into the ten carriages that waited outside. The journey began not long after, filled with chatter, laughter, and the excitement of a day away from lectures and rules.\nThe academy was about six hours from the beach, so they hadn't packed much—just a change of clothes and a few essentials. They were set to return by the next night, after all.\nAustin, Valerie, Rhea, and Sheldon ended up in the same cabin. Across from them, by chance, were a few familiar faces.\n\"Stalker,\" Averis muttered under her breath, even though she was the one who followed Austin into the carriage.\nAustin raised an eyebrow and smiled playfully. \"Is it a crime to sit near my sister?\"\nValerie leaned forward, her voice gentle. \"Your dress looks lovely, Averis.\"\nThe boy beside Averis beamed. \"Isn't it? I told her the same—\"\nJimmy, who sat beside her, lit up and began to speak, but froze when he caught the cold stare from across the cabin.\n\"What was that?\" Austin asked, still smiling. But his eyes, calm yet piercing, told a different story.\nA drop of sweat trickled down Jimmy's neck as he stammered, \"I-I said the color of—\"\n\"Of?\"\n\"Of the carriage! Yeah! It's… um, it's really classy, right?\"\nAveris turned to her brother with a scolding glare that said it all: Don't scare him.\nSheldon let out a quiet chuckle while Valerie glanced between them, a faint smile playing on her lips.\nThen, another junior chimed in—the same girl who had offered Austin a dumpling not long ago.\n\"Senior,\" she said with a curious glint in her eyes, \"is it true you're going to get reassessed for your rank?\"\nThe question caught him off guard. \"Yeah… I am. But how did you know?\"\nHe'd only talked about it with Sheldon just yesterday.\nAustin shifted his gaze toward Sheldon, who immediately raised both hands, as if to say, Don't look at me—I didn't tell anyone.\nThe girl just grinned. \"I've got a few friends here and there.\"\nAustin didn't press her further. \"Yeah, soon,\" he confirmed with a nod. It wasn't like it was a secret. Most people probably knew by now that he'd long outgrown his D-rank label. Sooner or later, it was bound to happen.\n\"It'll be exciting,\" she said casually.\nAustin blinked. Exciting? The word puzzled him. What exactly did she mean by that? Why would his reassessment matter to her?\nBefore he could ask, the conversation ended on its own, thanks to the girl sitting beside him. Her quiet presence was enough to keep others from lingering too long.\nJimmy, meanwhile, had finally pulled himself together. He accepted the bottle of water that Averis handed him, his fingers still a little shaky.\n\"Where'd all your confidence go?\" Averis asked, raising a brow. \"Weren't you the one who pushed me to sit in the same carriage as them?\"\nHer tone was flat, giving Jimmy no clue whether she was teasing him or genuinely curious.\nHe gave a sheepish smile. \"It's just early nerves. Once I get to know him better, I'll be fine. I won't be such a mess.\"\nAveris gave a soft hum in response, leaned back in her seat, and closed her eyes. A nap sounded better than overthinking.\nAcross from them, Valerie turned to Austin with a soft look. \"Want something to eat? I brought sandwiches… and cookies.\"\n\"I can't say no to your cookies,\" he said with a grin, eyes lighting up as she reached into her bag.\nHe took one, but instead of biting into it, he crushed it gently in his hand and let the pieces fall into his mouth.\nValerie smiled, her gaze full of quiet affection.\nRhea tilted her head, watching. \"Why do you break such a perfecty shaped cookie?\"\nAustin chuckled and nudged Valerie lightly with his shoulder. \"There's a story behind it. But don't worry—Valerie doesn't mind.\"\nRhea raised an eyebrow, still curious, but didn't ask more. Whatever that story was, it clearly meant something to the two of them.\nWith a small sigh, she leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes, letting the rhythm of the carriage lull her toward sleep.\nThe journey was long, and she didn't have much sleep after last night's training.\n....\nAfter traveling without a pause for six and a half hours, the carriages finally came to a halt near the edge of the pathway.\nThe students slowly got out of the vehicles, gasping and smiling at the sight that was presented before them.\nA huge sea spread before their eyes, the blue water stretching far into the horizon, shining under the warm afternoon sun.\nGentle waves rolled in, brushing the sandy shore with a soft, soothing sound. The breeze carried the salty scent of the sea, and seagulls circled above, calling out as they flew.\nThe beach was wide and clean, with fine golden sand that looked like it would feel warm under bare feet.\nA professor stood in front of the students and raised his voice just enough to be heard. \"We'll head to the beach house first—that's where we'll be staying. No need to rush. Just follow me.\"\nSome students looked longingly at the waves, itching to run straight toward the ocean. But they knew better. With the professor's sharp eyes and quick reflexes, they'd be caught before their toes touched the sand.\nOne by one, the students began to step down from the carriages, forming a loose line and giving space to those still inside. The teachers walked ahead, a few trailing along the sides, keeping the group in check as they made their way toward the beach houses.\n\"Let's go?\" Austin said, already holding Valerie's bag as he reached out a hand to her.\nValerie smiled and rested her hand on his. With a light step, she climbed down beside him.\nBut just as she did, Austin suddenly stopped in place, causing her to halt mid-step.\n\"Hm? What is it?\" she asked, looking up at him. He wasn't looking at her—his eyes were locked on the sea ahead.\nHis brows furrowed ever so slightly. There was something in that brief silence, something unreadable.\nThen, just as quickly, he blinked and shook his head. \"Nothing. Let's go.\"\nShe didn't push him for more, but her hand lingered a bit tighter in his.\n°°°°°°°°°\nThere were several beach houses, and since there were no families visiting the beach just right after the war, they were able to book every house that was available.\nThere were ten of them, and each had more than five rooms.\nStudents were told to group according to gender this time since they would be sharing rooms.\nUnfortunately, Valerie and Austin had to part ways since they were no exception to this rule.\nStanding near the entrance of the beach house with their hands connected, Austin said, \"I will meet you in a few hours. Don't rush and relax for a bit first, okay?\"\nValerie diligently nodded, \"Mm.\"\nThe teachers have told the students that they could go to the beach any time they want, but they can't dive into the water unless there is a teacher around.\nSince this was the secluded part of the SOS(Sea of Separation), there were no soldiers or lifeguards around.\nNaturally, the students weren't going to listen to every rule. And each one of them was superhuman, so surely they had enough confidence in themselves not to drown.\nAustin was sharing his room with Sheldon, and two people from the council named,\n\"Phil, Jacob...did you bring any sunscreen?\" Sheldon asked after he checked his bag and realized he had only brought swimming trunks and a comb.\nJacob, a shaved-headed boy who was also one of the Disciplinary Officers, nodded, \"Yeah, I always carry it around.\" He threw the tube to the President.\nAustin dropped onto the bed where Phil was arranging his clothes, making the raven-haired guy click his tongue, \"I am doing something here.\"\nAustin shrugged, \"It's my bed too.\" He intentionally extended his leg and pushed the pile of neatly tied clothes Phil had arranged.\n\"Hey! Stop doing that.\" Phil tried hitting Austin's shin, but the blond was too fast to get caught.\nJacob chuckled, \"Man, are you here to settle or something? Why so many clothes?\" There were more than seven sets of clothes.\nPhil scoffed, \"You won't understand. I am prepared.\"\nAustin hummed, \"Prepared for what?\"\nPhil, while still folding his trunks, answered, \"In the depth of the sea, there is a shell which has very precious blue pearls. It is priceless and very beautiful. I have heard legends about it that if a man gifts it to his woman, their soul reunites in the afterlife-\"\n\"Pfft-ahahaha!!\" Jacob started laughing, and Sheldon also chuckled at those words.\nPhil threw underwear at Jacob, and a small fight broke out.\nMeanwhile, Austin wasn't smiling.\nRather...he was thinking.\n'Blue pearl huh...'\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Trouble, fun, battle, and a lot of steamy romance await.

      "content": "On the other side, Valerie was sharing her room with Averis and Rhea. The fourth remaining member hadn't arrived yet, but Averis informed that the fourth member had already placed her luggage in the room, so anyone who came asking for space was turned away.\nValerie and Averis were sharing a bed. They had just dropped off their bags and decided to take turns using the bathroom to freshen up.\n\"It's so humid in here. Guh,\" Averis muttered, wiping the sweat from her face with a small towel.\nWithout a word, Valerie reached out and touched the towel. A coolness spread through it instantly, making it icy and refreshing.\nAveris paused and looked at her sister-in-law with a soft smile. \"Thank you.\"\nValerie simply nodded back, her smile warm.\nThen, she summoned her Shard and gave the floor a gentle tap. In response, blocks of ice began to form along the ceiling, while four small crystals appeared in each corner of the room. As they activated, the temperature began to drop.\nAveris let out a long, contented sigh as the heat faded. \"Ahh… this is the best,\" she murmured, lying back on the bed. A part of her couldn't help but feel a quiet envy—her brother was lucky to have someone so thoughtful by his side.\n\"Want something to eat?\" Valerie asked, offering her a small bag of food she had been carrying.\nAveris peeked inside and took a few cookies. As she nibbled on one, she looked at Valerie and asked, \"So… how did things get better between you and my brother?\"\nThe last thing she remembered, Austin was cold and distant, often brushing Valerie aside with harsh words. Valerie had eventually stopped trying, keeping her distance and only watching him from afar.\nThat painful silence between them was one of the reasons Averis had finally confronted Austin that day… the day they parted ways.\nValerie sat on the other side of the room, her eyes drifting to the window. \"He stood up for me,\" she said quietly. \"When everyone else turned their back, he fought for my dignity… and saved me.\"\nAveris hummed softly. \"I heard about that incident… wasn't Senior Rhea involved?\" she asked, lowering her voice. The bathroom door was thin, and she didn't want Rhea to overhear.\nValerie gave a small nod. \"Yes. But… it was just emotions getting out of hand. We worked it out later.\"\nShe remembered how it escalated. How she'd said things she now regrets—harsh, cutting words. Rhea had summoned her Shard in response, and Valerie, caught in the heat of the moment, instinctively did the same. She hurt Rhea—no, she almost killed her.\nShe still carried guilt for that. But even that guilt was dimmed by the one thing that bloomed in the aftermath—something she never expected.\nThat day, something in Austin changed.\nAnd for Valerie, it was the day a new chapter in their story began.\nRegardless of what changed his mind, one thing remained certain—since that day, Valerie had lived each day with a smile on her face.\nClick.\n\"Haah~ That was a good bath,\" Rhea said, stepping out of the bathroom with steam still clinging to her skin. A towel was wrapped around her body, another coiled over her damp hair.\nAveris instantly rushed to close the window. \"Rhea! You can't just come out like that!\" she said in a fluster, eyes wide.\nRhea shrugged casually. \"What? I'm not naked.\" She walked to the bed, unfazed, and began pulling on a pair of shorts and a loose shirt.\nAveris exhaled sharply. \"Even in my own room, I was never that carefree…\"\nRhea laughed at the remark, a light sound that echoed in the room. She was about to say something when the door creaked open again.\nThe fourth member of the room had arrived.\n\"Taya? Where were you?\" Averis asked, recognizing her classmate. Unlike most of the girls who crowded around her with questions or gossip, Taya was a quiet exception. Though they'd only shared a few hours in the library, Averis had taken a liking to her calm nature.\nTaya, with her glasses slightly fogged and her dark hair tied back, let out a small sigh as she placed a pouch on the table. \"I dropped this at the beach… it had all my savings.\" Her expression eased, clearly relieved.\n\"Did you ask the teachers for help?\" Rhea asked, a hint of concern in her voice.\nTaya shook her head. \"I was about to, but Senior Trevor showed up and helped me look for it.\" Her voice softened as a smile tugged at her lips. \"He's… really sweet.\"\n'Trevor…' Valerie repeated the name in her mind. She vaguely remembered someone with that name in her class.\nRhea nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, Trevor's a good guy.\"\nTaya tilted her head. \"You know him?\"\n\"Mm-hm,\" Rhea replied. \"He's helped me a few times with assignments. He's one of those people who's just… nice to everyone. Really dependable.\"\nTheir conversation naturally shifted into casual chatter—about Trevor, their classmates, and the little things that made their days interesting. Laughter slipped through now and then, soft and easy.\nNot long after, a message arrived from the teachers: lunch was ready, and they were grilling a barbecue by the beach.\nAveris stood up and stretched. \"Shall we go too?\" she asked.\nRhea and Taya had already stepped out.\nValerie gave a gentle nod. \"You go ahead. I'll take a shower first.\"\nAveris didn't insist. Once Valerie disappeared into the bathroom, she quietly followed the others outside.\nLeft alone, Valerie undressed and walked toward the water pool, where freshwater rippled in still silence. Her eyes softened.\n'Sweet of her,' she thought, realizing Taya must've been the last to bathe—and had taken the time to refill the tub.\nValerie lowered herself into the water, pleasantly surprised by how perfect the temperature felt. The faint, sweet fragrance rising from the surface made her blink in wonder.\nIt was calming—subtle, but just enough to ease the tension in her muscles.\n'Did she mix something in?' Valerie wondered, closing her eyes.\nShe leaned her head back and let herself sink into the warmth.\nJust for a little while… she let herself relax.\n....\n\"You're cooking?\" Sheldon asked, approaching one of the campfires and spotting Austin manning the grill, carefully brushing sauce over the sizzling meat.\nAustin nodded. \"I can cook well enough to survive.\"\nSheldon raised a brow. Seeing skewers and barbecue out here wasn't all that strange—but imagining someone from the royal palace, especially the Prince, knowing how to prepare them felt oddly out of place.\nStill, the smell was inviting.\n\"What about the Prez—uh, Annabelle?\" Austin asked, handing over a freshly grilled skewer.\nThe silver-haired boy glanced toward the other classmates nearby. They were deep in conversation, talking about their Shards, and didn't seem to notice the exchange.\nSheldon took the skewer with a grateful nod, then sighed. \"I sent her a letter… but she didn't respond before we left. I don't even know if she'll come.\"\nAustin turned the meat over the fire, the flames softly crackling. \"It's tomorrow, right?\"\nSheldon gave a quiet hum in response, his attention already shifting to the food in his hands. He bit into the grilled meat, savoring the rich, juicy flavor, letting the warmth distract him—if only for a moment.\n\"I think if she doesn't come, you should go tomorrow,\" Austin said calmly.\n\"To the Capital...? That would take more than ten hours,\" Sheldon replied, glancing at him with a conflicted look.\nAustin gave a slight shrug. \"If I were in your place, I'd want to be with her on her birthday—no matter how far.\"\nSheldon fell silent, his thoughts beginning to spiral. He did want to see her. But leaving would mean breaking the rules… and for the Student Council President to do that? It felt wrong. Reckless.\nBefore he could dwell further, someone suddenly called out, \"Hey, is that the Headmaster?\"\nHeads turned. A few teachers were heading toward the carriages—and walking among them was indeed the Headmaster.\nAustin frowned, handing the tongs to Phil. \"Keep an eye on the meat,\" he said, before blinking forward in a flash and stopping right in front of them.\n\"Is something the matter?\" Austin asked, his tone sharp with concern.\nThe sudden appearance startled the group.\n\"Gosh, Austin, be a little mindful of our age!\" one of the older professors gasped, patting his chest to calm down.\nThe Headmaster let out a soft chuckle and rested a hand on Austin's shoulder. \"It's nothing serious. I've just been called to the Capital—some urgent matter came up. No need for concern.\"\nAustin gave a slight nod, though unease lingered in his eyes. What could have come up so suddenly? And more importantly, how did the Capital know exactly where they were?\nBut he kept those thoughts to himself.\n\"Have a safe trip,\" he said with quiet respect.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "The atmosphere around the seven of them was warm and cheerful. They sat close to the campfire, sharing stories and laughter.\nValerie and Austin sat side by side, their hands gently clasped, chatting with Rhea and Sheldon. A little distance away, Jimmy, Averis, and Taya were deep in conversation about their classes and teachers.\nThen, out of the blue, Jimmy turned toward Valerie and asked, \"Senior Valerie, can I ask about your time as the Disciplinary Officer?\"\nThe question seemed to come from nowhere for those on her side of the fire, but the trio had been talking about the student council, so for Jimmy—now a disciplinary officer himself—it was a natural curiosity.\nValerie tilted her head, thinking back to those early days. \"I… made my name during the enrollment trials. That's why I was chosen. But not everyone liked it. Some students didn't take kindly to me patrolling the halls.\"\nThe fire crackled softly as everyone leaned in, listening closely. It was rare for Valerie to open up like this—unless Austin was part of the conversation.\nShe continued, her voice calm but distant, \"Once, a group tried to frame me. They found another Shard user with the same ice magic I had. Then, they locked themselves—and me—inside a locker room… and hurt themselves with ice magic.\"\nTaya gasped. Rhea's brows shot up. Averis's eyes widened, and Jimmy just stared, stunned.\nThat... wasn't a prank. That was something far worse.\nAustin hadn't heard this story before, though he remembered the time Valerie had been questioned by the higher-ups.\n\"So… what did you do?\" Averis asked, her voice soft, a little nervous. It was clear Valerie still held her title, so whatever happened, she must've gotten through it.\nValerie looked into the fire as she spoke, \"I made an ice lance and stabbed my own thigh. Then I collapsed beside them and pretended to be unconscious. In the end, they had no choice but to claim someone had ambushed us all. Everyone ended up the victim, including me.\"\nThe silence that followed was heavy.\nJimmy's mouth hung open. The others looked just as shocked. No one knew what to say.\nExcept Austin. Although he was worried about her situation back then, he let out a quiet chuckle and shook his head, \"Of course. They never could've guessed you'd go that far just to turn the tables.\"\nValerie smiled faintly, her fingers still wrapped around his.\n\"…They surely never messed with you again,\" Rhea said with a dry laugh, a little surprised by how casually Valerie spoke about it.\nValerie gave a small nod, her tone calm but firm. \"No, they didn't. Nor did anyone else. After that, I gained quite a reputation around the school.\"\nBut then she narrowed her eyes slightly, her voice turning serious. \"Don't ever try something like that yourselves.\"\nSheldon backed her up right away. \"She's right. Your seniors aren't bullies, and if anyone gives you trouble, go straight to the Vice President. He doesn't tolerate that kind of thing—not even a little.\"\nJimmy rubbed the back of his neck with an awkward smile. \"I don't think I'd even survive pulling something like that off. But yeah, I'll keep it in mind.\"\nJust then, the topic shifted when Taya leaned forward and asked, \"Senior Austin, why didn't you join the council?\"\nAustin gave a crooked grin. \"Because, until a few months ago, I was barely hanging on at the bottom of the list. I was clinging to the edge of Alex Circle.\"\nThere was no shame in his words. He said it plainly because it was part of who he was—and how far he'd come.\nTaya's eyebrows rose. \"So the rumors about your sudden rise weren't exaggerations.\"\nAustin gave a light shrug. \"Guess not. It all changed the moment I held this hand.\" He gently lifted Valerie's hand and pressed a soft kiss to the back of it. \"Lady Luck's been on my side ever since.\"\nValerie flushed, trying to hold back a smile, while the others grinned, clearly enjoying the sight of the two being as close as ever.\nThey talked for a while longer, sharing small stories and jokes—nothing serious, just easy conversations around the fading warmth of the fire. Eventually, Rhea began telling a bit about her past—before she joined the academy and the journey that shaped her into one of the strongest students of Valorian.\nAs she finished, Jimmy let out a soft breath and murmured, \"Your batch is really something... you're all true warriors. On the battlefield—and in life.\"\nHis words carried quiet respect, and they settled deep in the hearts of the four seniors. Valerie, Austin, Rhea, and Sheldon exchanged glances. No one said anything, but their smiles said enough.\nAs the sky began to glow orange with the setting sun, they decided to head back. Tomorrow promised a full day of fun, and they needed rest.\nJust before parting ways, Austin leaned toward Valerie and said softly, \"Hey, Val... meet me near that rock in an hour, okay?\" He pointed toward two large stones jutting out near the edge of the clearing.\nValerie's cheeks tinged pink. She gave a small, shy nod. \"Mm.\"\nShe walked back to the dorms with the other girls—Taya, Rhea, and Averis. As they approached the wooden stairs to the building, Valerie was just about to step up when—\nCRACK\nA sharp sound split the air. One of the wooden steps gave way, soaked and weakened from moisture, and a girl fell with a yelp.\n\"Are you okay?!\" her friend cried out, rushing to help.\nValerie instinctively stepped forward. She considered running to find a teacher—or maybe patching the step herself with a bit of ice magic—when suddenly, the sand beneath the stairs stirred. Like a living thing, it flowed up and molded itself, solidifying and filling the gap where the stair had broken.\nSurprised, she turned toward the source of the magic.\n\"Kyah! Senior Trevor!\"\n\"So cool!\"\nThere he stood—a tall, tanned young man with dark yellow hair that looked almost gold in the evening light, and sharp red eyes that gleamed like burning coals.\nValerie blinked, recognizing him instantly.\nTrevor.\nTrevor moved his hand slightly, and the sand responded instantly. With quiet control, he used his Shard to rebuild the broken stair as if it were nothing. Once done, he turned toward Valerie with a smile and a small nod.\nValerie nodded back, watching him for a moment. He's been helping out quite a bit lately… Was he always like this? she wondered. Still, without dwelling on it too much, she stepped forward to usher the others inside.\n\"You all go ahead and rest. I'll inform the teacher,\" she said.\nJust as she turned to leave, Trevor approached her.\n\"I will go and tell them.\" He offered\n\"I'm not tired, really,\" she said, blinking at him in slight confusion.\n\"Ah,\" he replied casually, \"I'm heading that way anyway.\"\nBefore she could say anything else, he was already walking ahead toward the place where the teachers sat.\nValerie paused, then shrugged. If he's that eager, fine by me.\nShe turned to make her way back toward the beach house—but then heard his voice call out behind her.\n\"Oh, by the way… Your hair looks more beautiful when it's undone.\"\nValerie froze mid-step.\nHer brows slowly drew together into a frown as she turned around—but he was already gone.\nA chill crept up her spine—not from fear, but from the uncomfortable weight of the words.\nHe knows I'm engaged… Was he hitting on me?\nHer frown deepened.\nAs she thought, only her Lord is the true gentleman in the academy.\nShe soon reached the room and was instantly questioned.\n\"Was it senior Trevor outside?\" Taya asked with slight excitement reflecting in her voice.\nValerie's expression turned slightly dark again, \"Yes...why are you so obsessed with me? He doesn't appear like a good person.\"\nTaya was taken aback, \"He is so sweet though. The coffee you had earlier, he provided it.\"\nValerie was surprised...Taya brought coffee earlier which Valerie and Sheldon had. Turned out, it was Trevor again.\n'Why is this guy all over the place all of a sudden?'\nRegardless, she didn't care much and decided to take another bath to prepare for her meeting with her Lord. And she also brushed her teeth...just in case.\nShe wore skirt and a T-shirt and allowed her slightly wet hair to fall over her shoulder.\n\"Going to meet my brother?\" Averis asked with a teasing grin.\nValerie faintly smiled but then sternly told her, \"Don't go out now. It's time to sleep.\"\nAveris chuckled and didn't say anything.\nValerie made her out of the beach house and approached the rock where he invited her.\nAll the way, she was calming her breath to not panic or become a blushing mess.\nHowever, the moment she reached the other side of the rock...her complexion changed and her mind turned numb.\nHer Lord had a woman in his embrace and was kissing her passionately with the woman's back against the rock.\nAnd the girl looked...exactly like Valerie.\n\"What ...is this?\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Here comes the drama.

      "content": "SHLINK\nAn ice spike tore through the silence, whistling through the air before piercing the girl in front of Austin. His eyes widened in shock.\n\"What the—\"\nThe girl's skin began to melt like wax, revealing the twisted face of a demon beneath.\nIt wasn't Valerie.\nThe one he'd been holding, the one he'd kissed—it hadn't been her.\nAnother spike that stabbed the demon and froze it to death.\nHe turned quickly, heart pounding, and there she was.\nThe real Valerie. Standing a few feet away, her hands trembling, and tears running down her cheeks.\n\"V-Val… I didn't realize it wasn't you—\"\n\"Don't touch me.\" Her voice was sharp, raw. She stepped back as his hand instinctively reached toward her.\nAustin froze, his fingers curling into tight fists. His heart felt heavier than ever.\n\"I...I didn't know. It looked exactly like you.\" His voice cracked, his grief laced in every word. \"There wasn't a single thing that felt different.\"\nBut Valerie shook her head.\n\"How could you not realize it wasn't me?\" Her voice trembled with pain—an ache deeper than betrayal.\nAustin wanted to say more, to explain, to reach her—but what words could fix this?\nAnd right now, Valerie didn't want his closeness, didn't want to hear his voice.\nShe just wanted to be alone with the hurt that was far colder than any ice spike she could conjure.\nShe stepped back, holding her other arm tightly as though that was the only way to keep herself from falling apart. \"Leave me alone for some time. Please.\"\nAustin's hand remained half-raised, his lips parted—but no words came out. What could he say?\nHe wanted to hold her, to beg for a chance to explain, but deep inside, he knew. If the roles were reversed, if he had seen her doing what he just did, he'd feel the same.\nHelpless and ashamed, he lowered his hand. His gaze dropped to the sand as she turned away.\nHe didn't follow her.\nValerie didn't know where she was going—she just walked. Step after step, as if the motion alone could pull her away from the images clawing through her mind.\nThat kiss… the tenderness… everything she had seen between them, even though it wasn't her.\nShe might have forgiven a moment of weakness once, back when her heart was still learning what it meant to love him—back when he had been lost in Rhea's shadow.\nBut not now.\nNot after everything they'd been through together. Not after the memories, the laughs, the dreams they dared to share. This wasn't a mistake—this was a betrayal. And it hurt in places she never thought could ache.\nHer steps eventually brought her far from the beach houses, and she collapsed onto the sand without realizing it.\nDHAK.\nShe didn't cry loudly—her pain didn't come in sobs or screams. Instead, it settled in her chest like a heavy stone, making it hard to breathe, harder still to think.\nShe stared at the waves, but they offered no comfort. Her eyes glistened, and the tears rolled down silently.\nThat's when a gentle voice called out, \"Are you okay?\"\nShe flinched.\nTurning her head, she saw a boy standing a few steps away. Someone she vividly remembered.\nHis eyes were soft with concern, and he didn't approach too quickly, as though respecting the fragile space around her.\n\"You're crying…\" he said quietly. \"Is everything fine?\"\nIt was Trevor—the same boy who'd helped her once before all this chaos began.\nFor the first time since seeing that heartbreaking scene, Valerie's eyes met someone else's... someone who didn't carry the weight of betrayal.\nAnd somehow, just seeing genuine concern—untouched by lies—made her throat tighten all over again.\n.....\n*Blob*\nAustin breathed slowly under the water, feeling the cool embrace of the sea around him. There were still more than ten minutes before the effect of Aqua Lungs would wear off.\nHe moved carefully, his eyes scanning the sandy ocean floor for the small, glowing blue pearls Phil had mentioned earlier.\n'Valerie shouldn't be here yet… right?' He had told her to come an hour later, and it had barely been half of that.\nRight after returning to the beach house, he quietly slipped back into the water, unable to wait. Maybe it was silly to chase after something like this—a pearl said to reunite lovers in the afterlife—but even if it was just a story, there was something about it that touched his heart.\nHe imagined Valerie wearing the pearl. Maybe in her hair, catching the sunlight like a soft glimmer. Or maybe as a small anklet, something delicate yet precious. The pearl itself was beautiful, but if Valerie wore it, it would become something truly meaningful.\nIt wasn't about myths or wishes.\nIt was about her.\nSomething about the idea of giving her that pearl made the world feel just a little more right.\nEven if no one else understood, he did.\nAnd that was enough.\nDbik\nAustin whipped around, his back instinctively hitting the coral wall behind him. Something had just moved—fast.\nHe reached into his inventory and summoned a small capsule, snapping it to life. A soft glow spread around him, cutting through the dark water with limited reach. The silence pressed in tight, yet his instincts screamed otherwise.\n'There's definitely something here...'\nHe was a whisper away from summoning his Shard but he didn't call it yet. Scar's presence had a ripple effect underwater, especially with the kind of inhabitants dwelling in this zone. He couldn't risk endangering the underwater residents' lives.\nHe continued swimming carefully, eyes darting around, every muscle on edge. The timer on his Aqua Lungs flickered.\n[5 min 00 sec remaining]\n\"Should I retreat?\" he whispered internally, gritting his teeth. But if he did, he wouldn't get another shot at this today—and tomorrow, he'd be back at the academy. No second chances.\nHe made his decision and started swimming downward, hoping to reach the shell and get those blue pearls\nThat's when he saw it.\nTwo crimson eyes—glared through the dark water. Wide apart. Larger than his head. And worse…\nMore began to appear.\nA dozen. No—twenty.\n\"Water dragons…\" he muttered.\nThe water around him churned subtly as they slithered into visibility, red eyes cutting through the dark like torches. And it wasn't just above him—his gut twisted as he sensed movement beneath as well.\n\"They're surrounding me.\"\nNot hiding anymore.\nThis wasn't random.\nThey had waited for him. Let him dive in. Let him stray deep enough. And now, they were closing in.\nHe glanced at the timer again.\n[Time remaining: 4 min 36 sec]\nHis grip clenched.\nThis was going to be tough.\n°°°°°°°\nRhea was sitting on the roof of the beach house, gazing quietly at the stars scattered across the night sky.\nThe other two had gone to bed, though she doubted either would truly sleep. Taya seemed to want to talk, but sensing the mood, Rhea had excused herself and climbed to the rooftop—one of the calmest spots around.\nLetting out a deep breath, she pulled her knees to her chest and hugged them, closing her eyes.\nIt was peaceful.\nThe gentle whisper of waves, the soft rustle of the sea breeze—it made her heart a little lighter.\n'What might he be doing right now…'\nBefore coming here, she had visited Morkel. She had asked if he wanted to come along, but he was overwhelmed—constantly pulled in by the students for classes, advice, or simply his presence. It wasn't possible for him to leave.\nShe had been spending more time with him lately. He was, after all, the only other person in the academy who had truly known Rudolph other than Austin.\nSo, he understood.\nHe understood her silences.\nHe didn't grow irritated when she fell into long spells of thought, staring into nothing.\nHe didn't ask her to move on.\nHe didn't pretend to understand what she had lost.\nHe just stayed there.\nAnd sometimes, that was enough.\nRhea opened her eyes again, glancing at the moon that hung like a silver scar in the sky.\n\"You idiot… you better be safe.\"\nHer voice was barely a whisper, carried off by the sea breeze.\nShe didn't know why, but tonight, her chest felt a little heavier than usual.\nIt was then that her brows knitted...a very uncomfortable sensation assaulted her, making her stomach wrench.\nShe looked up, her eyes glowing and her Shard instinctively appearing in her hands.\nFrom the shore...she saw them, more than fifty beings getting out of the water and marching towards the beach houses.\nThe numbers were growing, and all of them extruded a presence that gave her the chills.\n'An ambush...despite knowing Valerie and Austin is here?' No, they both were out, gone somewhere just the two of them. That means, this was a well planned ambush.\nRhea got up, holding her blade in left hand and the crossbow in the other.\nJust because Valerie and Austin weren't here doesn't mean she would let these maggots harm her schoolmates.\n\"I have been itching to train a little anyways.\"\nIt was time to slaughter.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"This is so messed up...\" Jimmy muttered, eyes wide as chaos unfolded in front of him.\nHalf the students had gone wild—clashing with the others like they'd lost their minds. It was like someone had twisted their thoughts, making them see enemies where friends stood.\nMeanwhile, the Student Council President and the well-known third-year, Rhea, were locked in battle against demons that had suddenly appeared out of nowhere.\nThe President was holding back multiple demons with his clones, but his strength was stretched too thin. His attacks lacked the impact they usually carried.\n\"Why are you just standing there?!\" Averis's voice rang out sharply from his left.\nJimmy turned his head and saw her, already summoning her Shard—a brutal chained mace—her stance ready to leap into the fray.\nHe hesitated. Should he go after the demons, or try to stop the students from killing each other? From his point of view, it still looked like a conflict… not possession.\nBut with enough strong students holding the line on the student side, he made his decision.\nHe summoned his Shard and stepped forward—vanishing from sight.\n\"Watch out!\" he shouted, appearing just in time for Rhea to dodge. His blade came down hard on the orc's raised arm, slicing it clean off.\nRhea didn't waste the chance. She leaped back and fired an arrow in one smooth motion. It slammed into the monster's chest and exploded—sending a shockwave that singed Jimmy's side too.\n\"Are you okay?!\" Rhea called out, rushing over and dropping to one knee beside him.\nHe was down, left arm lightly burned, his breath shaky.\n\"It's nothing,\" he said with a quick nod, managing a smirk. \"Good shot, by the way.\"\nRhea let out a breath. She should've aimed lower.\n\"Rhea! Need help!\" someone shouted. One of the Council members was barely holding on, pinned down by a massive demonic bird, its claws tearing at his shield.\nRhea shot to her feet, her focus snapping back to the fight.\nShe sprinted forward—her form a blur—as her sword came up over her shoulder. Her eyes burned with intent.\nThe demonic bird sensed her. With a single flap of its wings, it launched into the air, dodging the slash.\nBut Rhea was already changing form—her Shard shifting into a crossbow mounted on her forearm.\nMidair, she took aim and fired without a moment's pause.\nThe arrow vanished the moment it left the bow.\nA heartbeat later—boom.\nThe bird exploded midair, showering the field in blood and gore, a crimson rain falling over the battlefield.\nJimmy took a deep breath.\nThe infamous dual-awakened—Rhea. She truly lived up to her title as the third strongest student of Valorian.\nBut the battle was far from over.\nIn the distance, more demons surged from the water, like they'd been lying in wait for this exact moment. The ambush was still unfolding, and it was only getting worse.\nAround him, students lay bloodied and bruised, some unconscious, others groaning in pain.\nNo sign of the teachers.\nJimmy scanned the field again and spotted Averis, barely holding her ground as a swarm of goblins circled her like vultures.\nI should go help her—\nHis thoughts cut off sharply when a hand dropped onto his shoulder.\nHe flinched and turned his head.\n\"Prez?\"\nThe Student Council President stood beside him, pale and panting, silver hair clinging to his sweat-drenched forehead.\n\"My magic's running out,\" he said between shaky breaths. \"And the students… they're not stopping. I don't know what's causing it—but at least… they aren't killing each other. Yet.\"\n\"But the demons aren't stopping,\" he added grimly. \"And if this keeps up, the students will be crushed.\"\nAs he finished, the last of his clones was ripped apart—caught off guard by an orc that lunged from the side. Sheldon clenched his jaw, suppressing a groan as the pain of the destroyed clone echoed faintly through him.\nTurning to Jimmy, he spoke firmly, \"You have a teleportation skill, right? Find Valerie and Austin. Without them, there's no way we'll make it out of this in one piece.\"\nJimmy hesitated for a second, his eyes flicking toward the distant figure of Averis, still locked in a desperate struggle. He wanted to say something—anything—but the truth was clear.\nThey needed firepower. And fast.\nHe met the President's gaze and gave a sharp nod.\n\"I'll bring them.\"\nWith that, he vanished.\nSheldon turned sharply toward the swarm of demons. More than twenty still remained, and only five warriors were holding the line.\nIf not for Rhea's relentless strikes, half the horde would've already torn through to the students.\nHe drew his dagger, ready to plunge back into the chaos—when a sharp screech split the air.\n\"KHIEEEK!\"\nA shadow flashed across the sky. A monstrous bird demon, wings spread wide, was diving—not toward the fighters—but toward the defenseless students.\nSheldon's breath caught. No… it's not stopping. It's bypassing the front!\n\"Rhea!\" he shouted, urgency cracking his voice.\nThe pink-haired warrior was already moving. She turned and aimed, her crossbow trained on the descending monster. But the bird, sensing danger, tucked its wings and accelerated midair like a spear fired from a cannon.\n\"Shit!\" Rhea cursed under her breath.\nThe arrow missed by inches.\nThe demon shrieked again as it closed in—a blur of feathers, fangs, and hate—just seconds away from tearing apart the violent, unaware students who kept fighting amongst themselves, oblivious to the real threat.\nBut then—\nCRACKLE.\nA jagged bolt of lightning tore through the sky, followed by a thunderous roar that shook the ground. The bolt struck the demon mid-dive, exploding against its back with blinding force.\nThe bird screamed in agony, its body convulsing, wings spasming as raw electricity coursed through it. The creature was flung backward, smoke rising from its charred feathers.\nRhea's eyes gleamed.\nShe didn't waste the moment.\n\"Haa!\" With a sharp cry, she dashed forward, her blade slicing clean through the stunned demon—splitting its grotesque form in two.\nThe pieces hit the ground with a heavy thud, twitching once… then falling still.\nSurprised, Sheldon turned towards the person who launched that attack...only to find his gaze turning warm upon seeing the familiar girl making his way to him.\n\"Was I late?\" A smiling Anna asked.\nSheldon shook his head, \"Just right on time.\"\nThey shared a brief hug, a fleeting moment of comfort amidst the chaos before Annabelle pulled back and quickly assessed the scene.\n\"What's going on?\" she asked, her eyes narrowing at the clashing students.\nSheldon shook his head, frustrated. \"Not sure. It's like they're under a trance… maybe a spell. I haven't been able to snap them out of it.\"\nAnnabelle observed closely. The students weren't going all out—more like they were being dragged into violence by something foreign, while a small part of them resisted. Their attacks were wild but lacked true intent.\n\"They're not fully gone,\" she muttered. \"Something's suppressing their will but not their instincts. It's forcing them to lash out, but not to kill.\"\n\"Do you think a subtle shock could help them?\" Sheldon asked, desperation flickering in his eyes. \"Just enough to break the spell?\"\nHe didn't care if it hurt a little. Watching them wail and tear at each other like puppets while demons circled closer—it was unbearable. Worse, every time he tried to interfere, they turned on him as if he were the enemy.\nAnnabelle heaved a sigh, her brows knitting. \"We don't know the cause of their condition, so unless we find the root of the problem, we shouldn't act rashly. One wrong move could make things worse.\"\nSheldon nodded, though the answer didn't bring him any comfort. Still, it was the right call—tough as it was to watch.\nThen the ground trembled.\nGRUOOOH!\nA deep, guttural growl rolled across the battlefield like a shockwave. Both of them turned toward the lake—only to see the water parting.\nFrom its depths, a massive figure emerged.\nA Titan.\nDark yellow hair clung to its face, dripping with lake water. Its eyes glowed faintly, and every muscle on its towering body rippled with raw power, bulging like solid rock. With each step, it shattered whatever came in its path.\nIt was heading straight toward the students.\nAnd nothing in its path was surviving.\n....\nMeanwhile, Jimmy kept teleporting, blinking across the broken terrain with rapid flashes. The area was crawling with demons, but something felt different here. Unlike the chaos near the beach houses, these creatures weren't attacking aimlessly—they were standing guard, posted like sentries.\n'Who are they guarding…?' he thought, a chill running down his spine.\nHe got his answer when he reached fairly away from the beach houses—and saw them.\nValerie and another woman, locked in battle, fighting as if their lives were hung by a thread.\nBut it wasn't the battle that made his breath hitch.\nIt was her.\nA stunning woman fighting the S-rank, effortlessly fending off her attacks. Her movements were fluid, almost mesmerizing—long black hair whipping with every motion, crimson eyes gleaming with deadly grace. For a fleeting second, Jimmy felt like stepping in—not to fight, but to stop Valerie from harming something so divine.\nThen he saw them.\nThe horns curling back from her head.\nThe tail swaying like a serpent behind her.\nJimmy's expression twisted in horror as realization struck him like a bolt of lightning.\n\"She… she's a Demon General!\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "The moment Valerie saw her Lord kissing someone who looked exactly like her, a cold certainty settled in her chest.\nThey were both demons.\nShe didn't doubt him. Not for a single second. No one knew him like she did. No one understood how sharply his eyes could spot the tiniest detail—the curve of her fingers, the way she breathed when nervous, the little scar behind her ear. There were more than ten things he always noticed about her, things no impostor could ever replicate.\nAnd yet, he didn't recognize the fake?\nSure. As if she could believe that.\nBut instead of rushing forward and cutting them both down, she paused.\nSomething wasn't right.\nLately, too many strange things have been happening. That girl—friend of Averis. She suddenly got involved, always clinging to Trevor and singing his praises. And Trevor—who even was he? He came out of nowhere, acting like some hero, helping everyone at just the right time. Then came the notice summoning the headmaster to the capital. All too convenient.\nMaybe she was being paranoid, but after what happened nearly a month ago, she couldn't let her guard down. Not even for a breath. The only time she allowed herself to be truly vulnerable was when she was safe in his embrace, wrapped in the warmth that melted every fear.\nSo this time, she chose to act exactly as the enemy wanted her to.\nShe lashed out at the fake Austin.\nAnd honestly, standing in front of the thing that dared to wear his face, his body… that dared to mimic his voice, his presence—it took everything she had not to rip the creature apart with her bare hands.\nHer rage burned just beneath her skin.\nBut she held it in.\nInstead, she forced a few tears—just enough—and turned away from the beach houses, walking off slowly, making sure the demon would feel comfortable enough to reveal itself.\nShe would let it believe she was broken.\nJust long enough to find the truth—and then, she would crush it.\nJust as she expected—when she looked weak, when she was alone—someone came.\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked gently.\nIt was him. The one she suspected the most. He stepped closer, slow and unsure like he didn't know whether to comfort her or not.\nShe can feel it now... that demonic presence.\nMaybe earlier, the crowd had hidden it. But now, it was clear—dark, suffocating, and right in front of her.\nThere was no doubt. This was the one planning to trap her.\nValerie kept crying, head down, shoulders trembling. She waited. Let him think she was broken.\n\"I don't need your help… go away,\" she whispered, voice weak and shaky.\nTrevor paused, then stepped closer. He sat beside her.\n\"I—ah!\" he cried out.\nA sharp spear drove into his chest, freezing his skin instantly.\nValerie rose to her feet, slow and calm. Her face was blank, cold. The weapon in her hand lifted him off the ground like he was nothing.\n\"State your name,\" she said, voice quiet but deadly. \"Before I split you in two.\"\nHis shocked expression twisted into a wide, twisted grin. His eyes turned blood red.\n\"How did you know?\" he asked, his voice deeper now.\nHis skin started to melt, revealing something darker underneath. The boy everyone knew as Trevor was gone. The real face began to show.\n\"You really thought you could create a rift between me and my Lord with such a cheap trick?\" Valerie snarled. The ice from her weapon crawled deeper into his body, crackling.\nBut the demon only laughed, unfazed. \"You played your role well. I, the Master of Fakery, was fooled. Impressive.\"\nHis true face shimmered—elegant, almost beautiful. But Valerie didn't flinch. She'd learned her lesson during the training with Selner—lessons no ordinary teacher could ever offer.\nShe had learned how to bury her emotions. How to kill her instincts when needed.\nWithout a word, Valerie twisted her spear and drove it down toward the demon's chest.\nBut it never landed.\nA hand caught the shaft mid-swing. No struggle. No sign of effort. Despite all the strength Valerie poured into the strike, the demon simply held it—with a soft smile still resting on her lips.\n\"You're such an adorable creature,\" she whispered, her voice low and haunting. \"And beautiful, too. Why don't you join me? I could make you someone he can't live without.\"\nHer words crawled under Valerie's skin, cold and electric. It wasn't just the words—it was her voice, her presence. It made every hair on Valerie's body stand on end.\nShe knew exactly who this was.\n\"The weakest Demon General... the Queen of Nights. You were the one who targeted us during the contest,\" Valerie said, eyes narrowing.\nThat face—it matched the one Rudolph fought back then. And now, with her link to the demon Zevarath, her place in the demonic ranks was beyond question.\nThe woman gave a soft, amused laugh.\n\"That's it? Is that all you know about me?\" she asked, tilting her head as her dark wings unfolded behind her.\nShe began to float into the air, slow and graceful. The wind from her wings swept around her like a cloak of shadow.\nAs Valerie launched ice shards and lashes of frost, the demon simply drifted backward—dodging every strike without even looking. She cupped her chin lazily, smiling as if watching a child play.\n\"Tell me something, did he tell you about his past life where he was in a relationship with a woman named Monica?\"\nMomentarily, she froze, but it was enough for the Succubus Queen to notice as, with a grin, she added, \"Did he tell you how madly in love he was with her? Offering me chocolates and flowers every time we meet and how he used to bring me to his favorite places?\"\nShe hugged her lithe form as if reminiscing those moments. However, unlike what she desired, Valerie only scoffed,\n\"You really think he didn't tell me… about you?\" Valerie spat, her voice laced with pure contempt. \"While you're busy clinging to those pathetic memories, why don't you remember the day you begged him to let you go? The day you admitted you weren't good enough for him—and you were right.\"\nShe stepped forward, her gaze burning with rage.\n\"You're not his equal. You're not even his shadow. You're nothing but the Demon Lord's used-up toy—filth dressed in charm. A disgrace to women, a walking shame, and the last thing anyone like him would ever need.\"\nThe demon was no longer smiling.\nShe didn't move. Neither did Valerie.\nBut Valerie knew—she had struck a nerve. The perfect moment to attack.\nShe intended to slam her spear butt into the sand to launch forward—\nCRACK!\nTentacles burst from the ground, wrapping around her wrists and ankles like iron chains. With a sickening snap, they broke her bones.\n\"Guh—!\" Valerie grunted, her breath caught in her throat. The pain was sharp, but the pain she could handle. What mattered was that she was now wide open, exposed.\nShe gritted her teeth and commanded Shiverfall.\nEven as her body trembled from the pain, the Shard rose off the ground, floating for a second before it screamed through the air, aimed straight for the demon's chest.\nBut the Succubus Queen didn't flinch.\nShe raised one dark wing—graceful, almost lazy—and let the spear stab through the flesh.\nNot even a gasp left her throat.\nThe blade pierced clean through her wing and stopped… and the demon smiled again.\n\"You have successfully pissed me off, bitch. I originally planned on using you against him but now,\" she added with her nails turning into claws, \"You must die now.\"\nValerie clenched her fists, blood trickling from her lip, and called Shiverfall back to her hand.\nBut it didn't move.\nThe spear, like its master, was trapped—frozen in place as if bound by invisible chains.\nThe Succubus Queen stepped forward, each movement slow, deliberate. Her very presence pressed down on Valerie like a crushing weight.\nMeanwhile, Jimmy fought his way toward them, cutting through demons left and right. But there were too many. They swarmed him like a flood.\nStill, when he saw Valerie struggling, her life on the edge—he made his choice.\nNow or never—\nHe raised his scythe, ready to teleport beside her.\nBut then—he froze.\nEveryone did.\nEven the demons stopped mid-step.\nSomething was coming.\nThe sky itself seemed to grow silent. The world felt like it was holding its breath.\nA presence far beyond anything a Demon General could ever radiate.\nThe Succubus Queen felt it too. A chill gripped her spine.\nNo... Impossible!\nShe had sent over two hundred elite demons underground to stall him—to bury him beneath sheer numbers.\nAnd they all failed?!\nPanic flashed in her eyes. She summoned her demonic sword, raising it high, aiming to finish Valerie in one swift strike—\nBut Valerie vanished.\nThe tentacles holding her turned to ash and scattered in the wind.\nThe pressure around the Queen rose higher—so much she could hardly breathe. Her body trembled as the air behind her warped with silent fury.\nShe didn't need to look.\nShe knew who was there.\n\"M-My Lord…\" Valerie whispered, barely able to speak, her body aching, her eyes wide.\nStrong arms held her close.\nWarm. Safe.\n\"You can rest now,\" he whispered into her ear, voice low and steady. \"Everything will be fine.\"\nValerie let out a shaky breath and slowly nodded. With her face buried against his chest, she finally allowed her eyes to close.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. I had to edit this chapter thrice because of...the Succubus effect.",

      "content": "Jimmy knew that the rumors weren't all fake.\nWithout any facts or evidence people wouldn't have been calling Austin the war hero.\nAnd his attitude that day when he said his true Shard would have forced him to surrender...it was true as well.\nAfter all, what he was witnessing right now was anything but normal.\nMore than one hundred demons have spawned at the beach in the short duration he went to the other side to find the Seniors.\nThe situation seemed dire since Senior Rhea and the others could no longer protect the students anymore on their own.\nThey needed reinforcement or everyone would have been killed.\nAnd God, the reinforcement they received...it was a one-man army.\nDescending like an enraged God, he instantly got every demon's attention.\nSome staggered, some retreated and a few foolish ones lunged at the being whose blade had tasted their master's blood.\nResult? Pure carnage.\n\"The skill of his blade ..is insane.\" Averis, whom he came to help, couldn't help but mutter what he was thinking inwardly.\nThe little Princess knew that her brother had gone through evolution recently. The same Shard he hated for how it appeared initially, has become an instrument of death.\nAnd now, no one could deny the fact that Austin was indeed the one who ended the war a few weeks ago.\n\"What… is that ability?\" Sheldon muttered, more to himself than anyone else.\nAustin stood in the middle of the battlefield, both arms wrapped securely around his lover. He wasn't even holding a weapon—yet his blade floated around him on its own, moving with sharp, elegant precision.\nThe sword spun through the air like it had a mind of its own, slicing clean through anything that got too close. Enemies who dared to charge were cut down before they could even raise their weapons. Those who tried to flee didn't get far—the moment they turned, their bodies crumbled into bare white bones, stripped clean in seconds.\nRhea had seen it before. She didn't gasp or panic.\nBut still… the way the blade danced—flawless, silent, deadly—left her breathless every time.\nThere were no wasted moves. No blood on the ground.\nJust silence… and the cold efficiency of a blade that didn't need a master to kill.\n\"I think I understand now.\" Annabelle, who once was their strategist, spoke, \"See, those who are trying to run away are the only ones getting their flesh and blood ripped away from them.\"\nWhat she said was correct\nOnly the weaker demons who intended on rushing away or towards the water were suddenly met by a forcefield that ceased their existence in a blink.\n\"You mean to say those who have no will to fight him and have already accepted their defeat would get devoured by that blade?\" Rhea asked, connecting the dots.\n\"Yes...and the horrifying part, Austin isn't even actively using the weapon. He has left the judgment on the Shard while he is whispering things to Valerie.\" Anna didn't know whether she should feel shocked or smile at the couple who stood in the middle of the chaos yet didn't fail to pay attention to each other.\nSoon, the numbers started to dwindle and the blade became visible to others since it no longer needed to restlessly move around.\nHowever, just as they believed that the disaster was taken care of,\n*GUOOOOOO*\nA deafening cry resonated across the lands, making everyone cover their ears, forgetting about their battles and grudges against their schoolmates and kneeling on the ground.\nAnna and Sheldon also dropped low while Jimmy held Averis before taking cover behind the titan which was killed before.\nRhea groaned in pain while covering her ears as she glared at the sea.\nFrom the ocean arose a huge being, towering over the whole crowd, and each step sent tremors through the lands.\nIt was a demonic turtle, crying at its full capacity to announce the grief of losing its master.\nThe huge shell on its back was bleeding, and lava-like flames bubbling from the crown.\nThe beast directed its glaring eyes at the humans before it, before settling over a certain blond who stood there without moving even an inch.\nAustin narrowed his eyes...this was a thousand-year-old beast and could not be taken lightly.\nHe turned around and started walking—ignoring the beast for now.\nHe wanted to ensure Valerie's safety, and the person he could trust her protection with was, \"Rhea,\"\nThe pink head nodded before she held Valerie in her arms and advanced toward the Titan, from where Jimmy was waving at her.\nJust as Austin saw Rhea hide behind cover, he heard Sheldon's voice tear through the chaos—\n\"Austin!\"\nHe spun around. In an instant, his weapon shifted—its blade thickened, the handle stretched and rounded, molding into something built for impact.\nFrom the demon turtle's mouth, a glowing red orb began to form. It pulsed like a heartbeat, heat rising off it in waves.\nThe ground trembled. Water sizzled into steam around the beast's feet. Then—dead silence.\nTWOONG!\nA blast of molten fire exploded out, racing straight for Austin like a river of lava.\nWithout hesitation, he slammed Shard into the ground—now a broad, gleaming shield—and braced himself behind it.\n\"Grrgh!\" Austin growled, muscles straining as the wave of fire struck. The force was brutal, dragging his feet through the sand.\nThis thing… it wasn't just strong. It was ancient. A beast from another time, radiating raw power.\n\"Barrier!\" he shouted.\nA green wall of light burst into place, flaring in front of him. The flames split on impact, fizzling out like dying embers.\nAustin vanished.\nIn the blink of an eye, he reappeared high in the air, gripping a silver hammer that glinted under the smoke-filled sky.\nAnother barrier bloomed beneath his feet—his makeshift launchpad.\nWith a shout, he kicked off, soaring above the battlefield. The students and the demon both turned upward at once, catching sight of his falling form.\nHe raised the hammer.\nThen brought it crashing down on the turtle's head with everything he had.\nDIIIIING!\nA thunderous shockwave exploded from the impact. Sand blasted outward in all directions. The students threw their arms over their ears as the ringing filled the air.\nThe beach shook.\nThe demon staggered, shaking its head. A single crack split across the surface of its rocky skin—but that was all.\nAustin landed hard, dust exploding beneath his boots. He barely had a second to breathe before the beast's massive foot came crashing down where he'd been.\nHe leaped back just in time.\n\"Tch.\" He clicked his tongue in frustration. That hit should've done more.\nAGUOO!!\nThe demon howled, its voice deep and hollow like a dying volcano. Lowering its massive head, it began to glow. Then, with a sharp jolt, its shell flared—and a swarm of fiery embers shot out like missiles.\nThe sky darkened as the embers spread, raining down toward the beach in a deadly, burning wave.\nStudents screamed. Faces froze in horror. There was nowhere to run—no time to hide. The embers weren't just fast—they were inescapable.\nBut just before the first ember could strike—\nTHOOM!\nA massive green barrier surged into life, doming over the entire beach like a protective shell. The embers slammed into it, bursting into harmless sparks.\nSix hundred students stood beneath it, unharmed. Safe—for now.\n\"This won't do.\"\nAustin's eyes narrowed. The demon wasn't just attacking at random. It was after him—hurting the others was just a way to twist the knife deeper. A mental assault cloaked in destruction.\nThe Absolute Barrier would only last five more minutes. Meanwhile, the turtle showed no signs of stopping, hurling ember after ember like a volcano gone mad.\n'What do you say, system... should I try the second ring?'\n[Host, it's untested. And you still don't know the creature's weak point.]\nAustin scoffed, a crooked grin tugging at the corner of his lips.\n\"Who cares? Let's do this.\"\nWith a burst of energy, he leaped over the glowing green dome that protected the students. In midair, he summoned Scar.\nShard shifted once more—its shape flowing into a sleek, predatory bow.\nAustin pulled the string. There was no physical arrow. No drawn target.\nOnly pure pressure—raw intent.\nAs he drew it back, energy spiraled around him like a storm. The force ripped his sleeve apart, flames licking up his arm, scorching his skin.\nHe smiled.\nThe pain told him it was working.\nSensing danger, the demon halted its ember assault. With a trembling cry, it began retreating into its shell, the ground quaking beneath its weight.\nBut it was too late.\nNo shell. No stone. No barrier forged by nature or magic could stop what was coming.\n\"Here goes nothing.\"\nTWIING!\nThe bowstring released with a sharp crack—\nAnd from it shot a blazing arrow, shaped like a raven wreathed in flame, screaming across the sky.\nIt wasn't just an attack.\nIt was judgment.\nBOOOOM!!\nA violent explosion echoed across the beach as the arrow slammed into the top of the demon turtle's skull.\nFor a moment, everything stood still—\nThen came the rupture.\nA gaping hole burst open in the center of its armored head. Bone shattered, flesh torn apart like wet paper. Chunks of charred skulls flew in every direction. The force was so great, it caved in the top of the creature's cranium, steam and blood hissing into the air.\nThe demon's body twitched violently. Its legs gave out. Its glowing eyes flickered—then dimmed.\nFrom the smoldering hole in its head, black, tar-like blood poured out in thick streams, sizzling as it hit the sand.\nThe turtle let out one final, broken cry—\n\"Guohh...\"\n—and collapsed, half-buried in its own crater.\nAustin heaved a sigh and removed the barrier before landing on the ground.\nHe glanced at his wife and found her starry eyes fixed on him.\nHe redirected his eyes toward the monster and muttered under his breath,\n'The ancient creature have started to appear...I need to strike before they charge at once.'\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"It's not your real body, is it?\" Austin asked, looking down at the dying succubus.\nShe lay in a pool of her own blood, her skin pale and cold. Yet she didn't even try to cover her wound or fight back.\nThe battle ended almost instantly after Austin rushed out of the water and saw Valerie in pain.\nThis version of the Demoness was quite weak, even weaker than Zevarath. So it didn't take much time before Austin pushed the woman to the brink of her demise.\nA faint smirk tugged at her lips. \"You really think I'd offer my true form to the man who shook the Great Personage?\"\nAustin narrowed his eyes. \"You know you can't hide for long.\"\n\"I didn't come here to win,\" she said, her voice too steady for someone breathing her last few breaths. \"I just wanted to rattle you... and reveal your past life to the woman you care about so deeply.\"\nAustin let out a short scoff. \"Whatever you think, I've hidden nothing from her.\"\n\"But you did hide things from me,\" she replied, almost automatically.\nHer smile deepened, and with a hint of mischief, she added, \"Tell me, Luke, is that what you always wanted in a woman? Beautiful, loyal, soft-spoken... not to mention, she's stacked.\" Her eyes sparkled with amusement.\nAustin raised his brows slightly, a soft smile forming on his lips. \"All I ever wanted was for my feelings to be returned.\" He looked down at the woman in his arms and said gently, \"She accepted everything about me. She never made me feel like my love was too much.\"\nThe smirk stayed on the succubus's face, but its strength faded.\nAustin met her gaze and said quietly, \"We share a bond, Abriella. And until one of us truly dies, that bond won't break.\"\n\"Oh? Is that a threat?\" she asked.\nAustin closed his eyes and took a slow breath. Then he opened them and said, calm and clear, \"Do you really think you even count as a threat to me? Astaroth didn't keep you around for your strength. He kept you for your body.\"\nThe Succubus Queen laughed. \"Jealous?\"\nAustin didn't even flinch. \"Everything I need is right here in my arms. I only feel pity for you. That's all you are worth of.\"\nThose words and the way he looked at her… infuriated her. But all she could do was watch him through blurred eyes.\nHolding the woman so close, shielding her like she was precious...\nIt felt—\n\"Nauseating.\"\n°°°°°°\n[Present time]\nThe teachers slowly came back to their senses—so did the students.\nThey were still inside the beach house. The headmaster hadn't returned yet, and with not enough carriages to take everyone back to the academy, they had no choice but to wait.\n\"How is she?\" Anna asked as she saw Austin step into the room.\nAustin gave a small nod. \"Her bones will heal with proper rest. Averis is helping her change clothes.\" He sat down on the edge of the bed beside Jimmy.\nThe other students were resting in their rooms. Their heads felt heavy, their bodies exhausted. At this point, only a few hours of sleep could make things better.\nWhen asked they said they felt as if someone was disrespecting and hurting the God they worship. The identity of this God or the reason behind their devotion was unfounded.\nIn the end, Austin stopped asking and told the boy, Phil, to sleep.\n\"Where's Sheldon?\" Austin asked, not directing the question to anyone in particular.\nAnna responded, \"He went to check the checkpost. He's hoping someone there can arrange transportation. Staying here doesn't feel safe.\"\nIt was strange. With all the chaos that had happened, not a single soldier from the checkpost had shown up. It didn't make sense.\nBut Austin understood. Abriella had likely made sure anyone who might contact the Council was dealt with quietly. And since this was an isolated part of the SOS region, the Council rarely sent patrols this far out.\n\"Maybe we should wait for the headmaster to return… or for someone to respond from the capital.\" Sheldon had taken a letter with him. If he couldn't find any soldiers, he planned to send it through WarpMail.\nBut even then, it would take at least a day for help to arrive.\nUntil then, they needed to stay alert—for another ambush, or worse, for the students to wake up disoriented and turn on each other.\n\"It was the succubus's hypnosis,\" Rhea said, confirming what everyone had already suspected.\nAustin gave a small hum. \"It's one of the basic abilities of a succubus. And since she was a Monarch, she could project wide-area hypnosis effortlessly.\"\n\"And Trevor?\" Jimmy asked.\nAustin shrugged. \"I've got no idea where he is... or if he's even alive. All we can hope is that he stayed back at the academy.\"\nA heavy silence settled over the group. Uneasy expressions filled the room.\nAnna let out a breath. \"Never thought my birthday would turn out like this.\" Her tone wasn't bitter—it was an attempt to lighten the mood.\nAustin glanced toward the boy, guilt flickering in his chest. But some things were simply beyond his control.\n\"I don't get it,\" Rhea said, furrowing her brows. \"Why weren't Averis, Jimmy, and I affected? I understand Sheldon and a few others—they weren't in the beach house during the hypnosis. But the three of us?\"\nThe Succubus Queen's hypnosis should've affected everyone inside. It didn't make sense.\nRhea gave herself the benefit of the doubt—perhaps her dual awakening had something to do with it. That much she could accept.\nBut what about Averis? What about Jimmy?\nWhy were they immune?\nAnna looked just as confused.\nMeanwhile, Austin had already started piecing together a theory.\nHe knew that Rhea carried the essence of humanity's greatest hero—Kane. A man who had once stood beside him in battle.\nBut Kane hadn't been the only one. There were two more key members on that legendary team: a powerful sorceress, and a drunkard who, despite his habits, was an exceptional support fighter.\nJust like Rhea... there was a chance Jimmy could be the reincarnation of one of them.\nAustin turned to him. \"Jimmy… how did you know Valerie was fighting a General?\"\nEveryone looked up at once.\nFrom an earlier conversation, Austin had picked up on something—Jimmy had known Abriella's identity far too easily. Which was strange, considering the Council hadn't released any names or pictures of the four Demon Generals.\nAll eyes now settled on Jimmy. Annabelle shifted slightly, tension visible on her face. Austin's question suggested a possibility—was Jimmy connected to the enemy?\nJimmy noticed the change in atmosphere immediately. He raised his hands in panic, stumbling over his words, \"I-I just knew she was a Demon General the moment I saw her.\"\n...Not very convincing.\nThe way Rhea narrowed her eyes and the suspicious glance from Anna made it clear—Jimmy had only made things worse.\nBut before anyone else could speak, Austin stepped forward. His tone was calm.\n\"Don't worry, Jimmy. We don't suspect you.\"\nRhea opened her mouth to object, but Austin added, \"If he was one of them, his flesh and blood would've been consumed back then.\"\nThe weight of those words settled over the room.\nAnd just like that, the tension loosened.\nThe doubt faded from Rhea's eyes. Anna gave a small, understanding nod.\nFor now, Jimmy was still one of them.\n\"Then... why wasn't he controlled by that demoness?\" Annabelle asked, her brows raised in curiosity.\nAustin gave a slow nod. \"As for Averis—she received a blessing from the Pope on her fourth birthday. Apparently, she unknowingly did the Church a great favor, so curses and dark magic don't affect her.\"\nThat explained her immunity.\n\"But for Jimmy and Rhea…\" he paused deliberately, and both of them stiffened, their attention sharpening at once.\nAustin rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \"I have a theory. But before I say anything, I need to get someone's permission first—especially from you two.\"\nRhea tilted her head. \"Whose permission? Valerie's?\"\nAustin shook his head slowly, a faint smile on his lips.\n\"No. Someone else entirely.\"\nSelner—she was the one Austin needed to speak to before saying anything to Rhea.\nRevealing her origin might shake her, but it would also help her prepare. She needed to know who she truly was… especially if the demons still held a grudge against the Hero Kane.\nAnd they certainly did.\nThe door creaked open just then, and in stepped the silver-haired Princess.\nShe looked worn out—understandably so, after all the chaos she'd endured.\nAustin and Jimmy both stood up, instinctively moving toward her—only for Austin to halt mid-step, his gaze freezing on the other person behind her.\n\"...!\" Jimmy's eyes widened as Austin shot him a glare sharp enough to pierce armor.\nHe immediately backed off with a sheepish grin. \"J-Just got up to get some water.\"\nAveris let out a tired sigh. She gave the two a look before saying, \"She's looking for you. Go.\"\nAustin gave a curt nod and turned to leave—but not before shooting one last warning glare at the little bastard.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"How do you feel now?\" Austin asked as he sat beside the patient, who had her wrists and ankles wrapped in bandages.\nSuperhuman bodies healed quickly, so in just two days, she would be back to full health.\n\"I feel better now,\" she said softly, her smile tender but her eyes half-closed.\nAustin brushed a stray strand of hair from her face and murmured, \"Sheldon has gone to ask for help. If he can't find anyone, I'll carry you back to the academy.\"\nHe hadn't expected this trip, which was meant for laughter and quiet moments, to end like this.\nBut staying here would only weigh on their minds, and he didn't want them to be stuck in this place—where the memory of an ambush could keep them awake at night.\nSo he decided that once Valerie recovered, he'd bring her somewhere better—far from the sea, to a quiet place where they could rest and smile again.\n\"Austin…\" she called out, her voice even weaker now.\nHe turned toward her, his brows rising at the sound of her quiet confession.\n\"At some point,\" she said, her voice shaking, \"I lost control of my feelings. When I stood in front of that demon… it felt like hurting her would be a sin. For a moment… I couldn't hold back. And I hate myself for it.\"\nHer eyes filled with guilt, shimmering red with frustration.\nShe couldn't believe she'd felt that way toward someone else, even if it was just for a few seconds. It felt like she had betrayed her Lord. Like she had cheated on him.\nAustin's heart ached to see her cry, but he didn't panic. Instead, he sat on the edge of the bed and gently cupped her face. \"Look at me,\" he said softly.\nA teary-eyed Valerie shook her head, refusing to meet his gaze. But Austin was both patient and stubborn.\n\"Unless you look at me,\" he coaxed, \"I won't tell you how I feel about your confession. So, look at me.\"\nShe paused, hesitating, then slowly turned her face to him.\nMeeting her eyes, Austin spoke without hesitation. \"I've seen people fall for that woman, despite their hatred and the desire to destroy her. Even Kane, during the war, found himself hesitating. So did I.\"\nValerie sniffled, letting him wipe away her tears. She felt a little lighter, a little less alone.\nAustin continued, his voice calm and sure. \"She has a power—a charm—that can make even the gods question their own judgment. So it's no sin to waver a little. What matters is that you didn't let it break your resolve. You fought her until the end.\"\nValerie's voice was hoarse as she asked, \"Are you not angry?\"\n\"Why would I be?\" he answered, pressing a tender kiss to her forehead. \"It wasn't something you could control. But…\" His tone lowered, a protective edge sharpening his words. \"I won't let you feel that way again. I'll hunt her down myself.\"\nA shiver ran down Valerie's spine at his low, determined tone. She felt the heat rise in her cheeks as she met his eyes, her heart racing.\nShe didn't know why, but something about his possessiveness made her feel… safe and thrilled.\nHer allure was quite captivating. Austin wasn't able to pull himself back once he was so close to her.\nNo one words were required between them. They both knew what the other person needed.\nAustin leaned forward, and the half-lidded eyes on the girl shut closed as she offered herself to him.\nAustin claimed her lips as if he owned them. His kiss felt slightly rough, making her gasp but she made no effort to back off. She liked it. She craved more.\nTheir lips got into a soft but passionate lock, the heat between them building. Valerie lay back on the bed, her chest rising and falling as his touch slowly worked its way down her neck. His thumb brushed her jaw, leaving a tingle in its wake.\nShe moaned softly, parting her lips just enough for him to taste her deeper. His hand drifted lower, finding the slender waist. His thumb pressed into the tender flesh there, a teasing pressure that made her arch her back slightly.\nAustin pulled back just a fraction, his eyes half-lidded and dark with desire. He leaned in again, his mouth at the corner of her lips, planting small, slow kisses down the side of her neck.\nValerie shivered, her breath hitching as his lips brushed her collarbone. His hands slipped beneath the thin fabric of her shirt, warm and confident, teasing at the edge of her skin.\n\"More,\" she whispered, her voice breathless.\nWhile his lips traced kisses on her neck, his finger effortlessly undid her buttons, revealing her moon-white neck and exposing a healthy amount of cleavage.\nAustin's body grew hot at the sight of his lover presenting her vulnerable side as if demanding to be devoured.\nHer soft skin, heaving chest, slightly reddened lips…everything was inviting his whole being to just release the last thread of restraints and make her go sleepless all night.\nHowever, considering her condition, it would be painful and unfair to her.\nHe pulled back and instantly poured the contents of the glass resting on the bedside table on his head.\nValerie was startled as she broke out of her daze and hurriedly asked, \"W-What happened?\"\nShe thought they were…going to do it. She had made some plans as well. Although she couldn't wear the skimpy outfit she brought along, she was happy and excited that they were finally crossing the last line of their relationship.\nHowever, \"Not now…first recover, then we will properly do it.\" He said, through his ragged breaths.\nThe fabric of restraint had grown so frail just now that he might have ended up…\nBut her bones haven't recovered, so even the slightest of movements would cause her pain.\nValerie felt sad...after coming this far he had to stop himself for her.\n\"Hey, don't look like that. We have all our lives together. And I know once I get the taste of you...I will want you every single day.\"\nShe didn't know whether it was because of his words or how casually he said them, but her face turned hot red.\nShe averted her gaze, bringing a merry laugh from Austin.\n\"Sleep for now, Val. I will wake you up when we are ready to leave.\"\n\"Mm.\" She nodded before she was covered with a warm blanket.\nAustin didn't stay there for long and walked out of the room.\nThere he found Sheldon, who was just entering the beach house.\n\"Did you find someone?\" Austin asked after making enough distance from the room to not let his voice disturb the students.\nSheldon ran his hand through his hair. He was clearly frustrated. \"There was no one at the check post. Calling it a coincidence or them slacking off sounds ridiculous.\"\n\"So they indeed were removed before the demons ambushed. It shows that the Demoness feared the council.\"\n\"This whole incident seemed messed up, truthfully.\" Sheldon soon followed.\n\"What do you mean?\" Austin asked, gesturing him to step outside.\nSheldon looked at the beach where the huge skeleton of the demonic turtle was still resting as he said, \"The Demon General knew you were here, yet she attacked us. She could have chosen anywhere else, including the academy and you wouldn't have been able to reach there on time.\"\nSheldon's suspicion was justifiable. Despite being the weakest Demon General, she went against two S-ranks as if it was nothing concerning.\n\"Her intentions were to create friction between me and Valerie,\" Austin told him, taking Sheldon off guard.\n\"You mean to say...\"\n\"Yeah. She used clones or something to show that I was cheating on her and then she approached Valerie when she was sad and vulnerable. But naturally, Valerie didn't fall for her.\"\nSheldon didn't know...and the news was quite disturbing.\n\"The shapeshifting ability of the demons...this isn't the first time you two have nearly suffered because of it,\" Sheldon added as he remembered how a few months ago, a few demons entered the academy and targeted Valerie.\nAustin exhaled a sigh, resting his back against the wall as he said, \"This is getting out of hand. They are coming over, killing people, destroying them...and we are doing nothing.\"\nAustin was not angry but frustrated by how submissive these people are whom he stands to protect. They can't take a damn decision and be bold enough to go on offense.\nThey can just sit back with their shields up and wait for the enemy for all their life.\n\"You suggested taking charge during the discussion right?\" Sheldon asked.\nAustin scoffed, \"You think those wusses will ever do anything unless one or two kingdoms don't get swallowed by the demons?\"\nSheldon grimly shook his head.\nAfter a brief silence ensued the silver head was about to say something when suddenly Austin stepped forward and said, \"Well, go and join Annabelle. I will be back in a minute.\"\nSheldon's brows elevated as he followed Austin's line of sight and found himself looking at a certain violet-haired woman—standing atop the turtle's skull.\nThe only word that left his lips upon seeing her was, 'Beautiful...'\nShaking his head, Sheldon decided to no longer gawk at some other woman and return to his girl.\n—TBC\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"It's been a while,\" Selner heard his voice and turned toward him.\n\"You slew something ancient,\" she said with a quiet smile, jumping off the skull.\nShe didn't crash—she drifted down like a feather, landing gently in front of Adrian.\nThen, for a moment, she froze.\nHer eyes met his.\nTime stood still.\nHer heart began to race. Loud, wild, as if it would betray her thoughts.\nShe quickly looked away.\n\"How did it—\"\n\"Selner,\" Austin's voice broke through.\nShe took a breath, steadying herself. \"I'm sorry... I just lose control sometimes.\"\nShe apologized even though she didn't have to.\nAustin let out a soft sigh and walked up to her.\nHe gently held her hand.\n\"You don't have to look away… or feel sorry. I may not be the same Austin who once loved you, but I'd never blame you for still having these feelings.\"\nHe said just enough—enough to comfort her, without betraying Valerie.\nSelner bit her lip and shook her head.\n\"Let's not go there, Austin. I don't want to trap you with something you didn't choose.\"\nShe gave him a fragile smile. \"And please… don't pity me. That would only make my feelings feel small.\"\nAustin fell silent for a moment, then gave a quiet nod.\nSelner took a breath to steady herself before asking, \"Did you meet the Succubus Queen?\"\n\"Yes,\" he said. His gaze drifted away from hers. \"She spoke about my past... I'm worried she might spread it.\"\nSelner frowned. \"And why does that bother you?\"\n\"I mean… won't the council come after me? Question me about the other world?\"\nShe shook her head gently. \"You're not someone they can handle lightly anymore, Austin. They'll have to tread carefully now. You don't need to feel threatened.\"\nAustin let out a quiet hum. \"Alright, I won't worry about her... for now. What really bothers me is the ancient beings waking up from their slumber.\"\nSelner nodded, her eyes drifting to the massive skeleton nearby. \"They're getting stronger—and bolder. They're preparing before Astaroth regains his full power.\"\n\"Astaroth...\" Austin muttered, his tone darkening. \"...How long until that bastard comes back?\"\nSelner didn't take long to answer. \"Maybe six months?\"\nThe last time she checked, his upper body had already reformed. He was even strong enough to speak.\nShe hadn't said a word to him—but he had spoken to her the moment she stepped into the demon realm.\n\"Six months...\" Austin let out a dry laugh, but there was no trace of amusement. \"That might just be how long this world has left.\"\nHe couldn't even begin to imagine what he'd have to face once the Demon Lord returned.\nHundreds of thousands of demons would soon flood toward the human realm.\nThe Sea of Separation would run red.\nThe sky would mourn again.\nAnd rivers of blood would fill the streets of every city.\n\"You're worrying too much,\" Selner said gently. \"You have the strength—and the influence—to protect the ones you care about.\"\nAustin let out a long sigh. \"But I don't think I can do this alone. He has an entire army… and all I've ever had is a small handful of people I can trust.\"\nHe wasn't going to walk the same path as his predecessor—charging in alone like a one-man storm.\n\"And I'm not as strong as that Austin,\" he muttered, rubbing the back of his neck. \"I can't just knock on their gates and tear everything down.\"\nThe memories he had seen… that version of him had been overwhelming—impossibly powerful, like a force of nature.\nSelner crossed her arms and looked at him.\n\"Do you know why one of your soul fragments was sent to a different world?\" she asked.\nAustin shrugged. \"So I could… enjoy some peace and quiet?\"\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"And do you not feel at peace beside Valerie?\"\nAustin stumbled over his words. \"That's not what I meant—okay, I don't know. Just tell me.\"\nSelner smiled faintly. \"You never respected the strength you were given. You never cared for the system that guided you. You ignored the only girl who loved and worshipped you her whole life. So, to make sure that didn't happen again… you were sent to a world full of pain, full of lessons.\"\nAustin said nothing, listening.\n\"And after all those years of struggle,\" she continued, \"you finally learned to respect Scar… just as you respect your system. You no longer draw your weapon just because someone breathes too loudly near you.\"\n\"You've become more human now.\"\nShe stepped closer, her voice softer. \"And because you have people you're afraid to lose… you'll reach a height that the old Austin never could.\"\nAustin was left speechless.\nShe… really knew how to motivate someone.\n\"I don't remember you talking this much before,\" he said, trying to hide his fluster.\nSelner let out a soft chuckle. \"I usually don't. But I speak up whenever I see you losing your momentum… or straying from your path.\"\nAustin scratched the back of his head, a little embarrassed. \"Thanks... I mean it. You've helped me more than you know.\"\nSelner hesitated.\nThe words were on the tip of her tongue.\nShe wanted to tell him—\nThat the only purpose she ever had… was to make sure he could live a happy life.\nBut she held it in.\nNo point in making things awkward again.\n\"Ah, Selner,\" Austin said, shifting the topic, \"about Jimmy… do you think he—?\"\n\"Yes,\" she interrupted gently, \"he's Johny's successor. That same reckless drunkard who tried helping you... and ended up triggering a trap that cost him his life.\"\nAustin winced.\nHe remembered. Faintly, but enough.\nJohny had been a skilled warrior—sharp in battle—but his bad habits had always dragged him down.\nHe was almost always high. That part never changed.\n\"So Jimmy really has Johny's blood… and his powers,\" Austin murmured, folding his arms across his chest.\nSelner nodded. \"Yes. I sensed it in him today. And I was honestly surprised.\"\nAustin frowned slightly. \"Did you not find him in the previous timeline?\"\n\"I never had to,\" Selner replied. Her tone softened. \"Back then… you thought you were enough. Or maybe you were just trying to be. My focus was only on helping you.\"\nAustin let out a quiet sigh. \"What about now? Should I tell Jimmy about his ancestors? And… Rhea, I think she deserves to know the truth about where she comes from.\"\nSelner tilted her head, thinking for a moment. \"If you plan to do that, you'll have to tell them everything—about your past, how you know their ancestors and all the rest.\"\nHe already knew that.\nBut that didn't make it easier.\n\"There's no law stopping you from revealing your past,\" Selner added. \"But before making any decisions… talk to Valerie.\"\nAustin slowly nodded. \"I was planning to. But she's injured right now.\"\n\"Don't worry,\" Selner said gently. \"I healed her.\"\nAustin jolted. His eyes widened. \"You did?\"\nShe smiled softly. \"It wasn't anything serious.\"\nHe exhaled a long, heavy breath. \"Really… I don't know how to thank you.\"\nSelner stepped closer and placed a hand on his shoulder.\n\"If you want to repay me,\" she said, \"then fulfill what Austin once dreamt of.\"\nAustin paused, letting the weight of her words settle in his heart.\nThen he gave a firm nod.\n\"Nothing will stop me until every last demon is dead.\"\nSelner gave his shoulder a final, gentle squeeze.\n\"Take care,\" she whispered—and vanished without a trace.\nAustin stood there in silence, trying to calm his heart.\nEver since he learned about his past with Selner… it always hurt to face her.\nThe way her eyes searched for the man she once loved… only to find someone else.\nEvery time he looked away, it felt like betrayal.\nBut what could he do?\nHe couldn't lie to himself, and he would never betray Valerie.\nAnd trying to comfort Selner… would only be a pity.\nThat, too, would be a wound.\nAll he could do—was silently hope.\nThat someday, somehow… she would be reunited with the man she had once given up everything for.\nHer power.\nHer position.\nEven her life—just to be with him.\n....\nThe next day, several carriages and the officers of the council arrived.\nStudents were carried to the carriages since they still were disoriented. However, they were no longer aggressive and were listening to people.\nSheldon and Valerie, now all healed and healthy, were reporting to the soldiers what happened and whom they faced.\nThe news of a Demonic General appearance shook them, but Austin barely believed that they would trust the report.\nThe skeletons of the demonic turtle were collected and taken for research. But Austin doesn't believe they would achieve anything.\nScar absorbs everything except for the bones, including the fluid inside the bones. So yes, they are just carrying material to make decorative items.\nJust as he was about to approach Valerie and take her to the carriage, an officer approached him, \"Sir Austin,\"\nHe turned with his brows raised.\nThe soldier relayed, \"Sir William has requested a meeting with you, wherever you feel comfortable.\"\nAustin hummed in confusion but then he didn't think much and said, \"Tell him to find me in the academy.\"\n\"Understood.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I might write a chapter to show the life Selner had with Austin?

      "content": "It was just before everything turned to chaos—before the tournament changed their lives.\nOn one of those quiet days, Austin sat in his office while Valerie rested on the couch nearby.\nThey were working together. Valerie was helping him prepare a record of all the goods that had been transported from different cities to the capital—the dates, the routes, and the estimated costs, based on the data Austin had given her.\nMost of Austin's tasks were small things. Simple work, the kind that could easily be done by someone else. And even if it wasn't, it didn't really make a difference to the bigger picture of the administration.\nStill, he never complained. He did what he could—because deep down, he wanted to be seen as part of the family.\nBut no matter how much he did, a thought quietly stayed with him:\nOnce Adrian was gone... would they still let him stay?\nWould they still call him a Prince? Or would that title be taken from him too?\nHe didn't have an answer.\nAustin lifted his eyes and looked at Valerie. Just for a moment.\nShe was focused on the report, her brows slightly furrowed in concentration.\nChewing on the end of her pencil, she carefully studied the notes before filling out the datasheet, double-checking each number.\nAustin watched her for a moment and smiled to himself. There was something quietly endearing about the way she worked. Then he turned back to his own papers.\nAfter a while, a sheet of paper was held out in front of him.\n\"Here,\" she said, \"check this and tell me if there's something wrong.\"\nAustin took the sheet and quickly compared it with the average prices he had memorized.\n\"Hmm... the price of nails and barrels is off,\" he said, spotting the error within seconds as he scanned three columns.\nValerie nodded, took the paperback, and walked over to her seat again.\nAustin glanced at her as she returned—and noticed something odd.\nShe was frowning. Her lips were pressed into a thin line, and there was a tightness in her expression that hadn't been there before.\nShe looked... irritated.\nThat wasn't like her.\nStill, Austin didn't say anything. He quietly returned to his work, though a part of his mind stayed on her expression, trying to figure out what had changed.\nShe had been eager to help him—that's the only reason he hadn't refused her.\nBut if this was getting too hard on her... he would find a way to keep her away from this pointless work.\nShe was already training him, attending the classes, pushing herself in personal training, and studying for the mid-terms.\nThe pressure must be overwhelming.\nAnd here he was—making her do even more.\nAustin let out a soft breath and went back to the documents.\nNumbers gave him peace.\nHe began working through the data—calculating the average income of people from different regions across the nation, comparing it with their expenses, and then with figures from the past years to measure progress.\nHe knew his input might not matter much in the grand scheme, but still, he added a short note at the end—highlighting which areas needed attention, and suggesting how things could be improved for the people's well-being.\nJust then, a sheet was extended toward him again.\nStill lost in thought, Austin glanced at it and muttered, \"The price of horseshoes and shackles is miscalculated—\"\n\"Why are you such a perfectionist? It's not like anyone's actually going to check it!\"\nValerie's sharp voice cut through the silence, and Austin's eyes slowly rose in surprise.\nHe blinked, startled.\nShe'd never spoken to him like that before.\nTheir eyes met, and in that brief moment, Valerie seemed to realize what she had just done. Her anger crumbled into disbelief. Her eyes widened, and the color drained from her face.\n\"Oh my god... I—I...\" Her voice cracked as tears welled up in her eyes.\nShe let go of the paper like it was burning her fingers and took a shaky step back.\nShe couldn't believe it—she had just snapped at her Lord.\nAt Austin.\nSomeone who always remained respectful and patient with her ...she disrespected him.\n\"Valerie... it's okay. Calm down,\" Austin stood quickly, his voice gentle, hand reaching out to stop her.\nBut it was already too late.\nShe turned around and bolted out of the room, the sound of her footsteps fading down the hallway.\nAustin panicked.\nHe rushed out of the room without a second thought—but she was already gone.\nVanished like smoke.\nHe couldn't even catch a glimpse of her.\nOf course, he didn't return to the office. His feet carried him straight out of the dormitory, chasing after her in a near sprint.\nValerie was fast—faster than him—and after racing down the stairs and checking a few paths, he found himself out of breath.\nHe paused, chest heaving, trying to think. Where could she have gone?\nThe classrooms were closed off after the demon attack. She wouldn't go there.\nThe common hall? Too crowded. Too public.\nValerie wouldn't want to be seen like that.\nThen—\nAh.\nHe turned and dashed toward the back of the academy.\nHe'd seen her slip away to that spot a few times in the past—usually when something was weighing on her or when she needed a place to be alone.\nHe couldn't be sure, but it was a place to start.\nThat part of the campus was quiet. Most of the students were out enjoying the unexpected holiday, unaware of the storm in Valerie's heart.\nAustin stepped into the darkened gymnasium. The echo of his footsteps was the only sound.\nHis eyes scanned the empty arena. Nothing.\nSo he kept looking—checking the stands, scanning every corner...\nAnd there she was.\nCurled up in the farthest corner, face buried into her arms, knees pulled to her chest, her shoulders trembling quietly.\nAustin let out a shaky breath, relieved.\nHe climbed over the low wall and approached slowly, careful not to startle her.\nHe sat beside her, letting a few seconds pass in silence before gently saying,\n\"You scared me there… running off like that.\"\nShe didn't respond. Didn't even look at him.\nBut the quiet sound of her weeping spoke louder than words.\nHe reached out and held her hand, his voice calm, steady.\n\"Val... do you really think our bond is so weak… so shallow… that I'd hate you just because you shouted at me?\"\nShe flinched, then slowly turned to look at him—eyes red, lips trembling.\nAustin didn't say anything at first. He just pulled out a soft handkerchief and gently reached up, wiping away the tears streaming down her cheeks. His touch was warm, careful, and quiet.\nThen came her voice—small and cracking.\n\"B-But... you didn't do anything to deserve that. I was being unreasonable because… I couldn't control my emotions.\"\nAustin nodded slightly. He already knew. Valerie rarely let her emotions slip, especially not when they were working together. She was always composed. Always collected.\nBut today… she broke. And he was right there to see it.\nHe gave her a faint smile, still holding her hand.\n\"It's okay, Valerie. You don't have to hold back with me. If you ever need to shout—do it. If you're angry, if you're sad… let it out on me. I won't mind.\"\nHis voice was soft but steady. Each word wrapped around her like a gentle embrace.\n\"Because we're not partners just in happiness. We're in this together—joy, sorrow, frustration, all of it. That's what it means to stay by someone's side… right?\"\nValerie stared at him for a moment, eyes glistening. Then, quietly, she nodded.\nHer breathing steadied. Her shoulders stopped trembling. And for the first time since she ran off, her fingers gently closed around his hand—gripping it back.\nAustin hesitated. He knew he wasn't on Earth anymore—this wasn't something people asked casually here. Still, he took a breath and asked, gently,\n\"Valerie… are you on your period?\"\nShe froze, eyes snapping toward him in shock. \"How do you…\" Her voice trailed off, her face flushing a deep red.\nIt was clear she hadn't expected that. And in this world, it wasn't something women usually shared with their partners. But Austin wasn't like the people here.\nHe gave her hand a warm squeeze.\n\"I've read enough to know what women go through during those days,\" he said softly. \"So, it's no surprise your mood shifted earlier.\"\nValerie looked down, clearly torn between guilt and embarrassment. She didn't know what to say.\nAustin reached out and cupped her cheek with quiet tenderness.\n\"This stays between us, okay? You don't need to feel embarrassed. I just want to know when it usually happens… so I can take better care of you.\"\nShe hesitated, then whispered, \"B-But Mother said…\"\n\"Forget about her,\" he interrupted gently. \"I know she must've told you men don't care about things like this—but I do. I know it hurts. And even with that pain, you still helped me train this morning.\"\nValerie's eyes widened. Her heart skipped a beat. No one had ever said anything like that to her before. Her mother taught her to keep these things to herself. It was a part of etiquette.\nAnd yet… here he was. Caring. Soft. Present.\nShe felt something stir inside her, a quiet warmth, a kind of joy that was hard to explain.\nCould there really be a man more thoughtful than him?\nAustin leaned in and placed a gentle kiss on her forehead.\n\"Come on,\" he said with a soft smile. \"Let's go back. I'll give you a nice massage… and make you some dark chocolate.\"\nA quiet giggle escaped her lips. She hummed in agreement, her smile stretching from ear to ear.\nSomething changed between them that day.\nValerie started opening up more—sharing the thoughts she once buried, expressing feelings she used to hide. The wall she had built around herself began to slowly crumble… all because one man dared to care.\n....\nIt had been almost a year since that day.\nNow, Valerie was lying on the bed, face down, as Austin gently massaged her lower back.\nA soft purr escaped her lips, the tension slowly melting from her body. The dull ache in her abdomen was fading with every stroke of his hands.\nAustin smiled as he watched her relax. \"You sound adorable, Val,\" he whispered.\nShe let out a small laugh, her voice muffled by the pillow. \"Can't help it… your hands are just too good.\"\nHe chuckled, leaning down to press a tender kiss on her cheek.\nTo others, this might seem like a small moment—something ordinary and forgettable.\nBut for them, it was everything. A quiet piece of love. A bond that spoke louder than words.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I felt happy writing this chapter. Thank you for reading.",

He had been under a spell—a strange pull that led him to follow a letter. It was a trick, a fake message meant to lure him away.\nAs soon as he arrived in the capital, the King understood the weight of the situation and quickly sent a small force to the beach to rescue the children. But by then, the council had already acted. They took the children and brought them back to Valorian.\nThey also took the remains of the demons. Austin didn't argue—there was no use for them anymore.\nLately, Austin had begun to feel like his old self again. Each day seemed to carry a little light, a little warmth—especially with Valerie beside him.\nBut still, there were moments. Quiet, aching moments.\nIt hurt, waking up alone. It hurt to open the door and find no one waiting on the other side. His heart would grow heavy in those seconds, sinking deeper than he'd ever show.\nYet, he kept that pain to himself—even from Valerie.\nNot because he had to.\nBut because he didn't want to be a burden.\nThey say people start to forget even their favorite person after a few weeks. But Austin hadn't. He couldn't.\nSo, instead of pushing the feeling away, he chose to embrace it.\nHe didn't want to run from the memories of his Godfather—didn't want to lock them away like a painful secret. He wanted to remember. Every laugh, every lesson, every kind gesture. He wanted to hold onto those moments, cherish them, and keep moving forward with them in his heart.\n....\nOne quiet morning, Austin was heading toward the common hall where Valerie was waiting for him.\nThe academy felt strangely empty. Most of the students were still in their rooms, resting and trying to recover from what had happened. It had only been a week, after all.\nA few had started coming out, trying to return to something close to normal—but it wasn't easy. For many, the fear still lingered.\nClasses hadn't been suspended, but the faculty decided that those affected would be given special consideration during the midterms. It was only fair—they'd missed the foundation classes, and their minds were still healing.\n\"I fear people might start to lose faith in Valorian.'\nIt was a quiet thought, but a heavy one.\nThis was the third major attack on students. No lives were lost, but that didn't soften the blow. No parent would feel safe leaving their child in a place that kept failing to protect them.\nSometimes, staying uneducated felt safer than not staying alive.\nAnd there were other academies out there—ones with stronger walls and fewer scars.\nConsidering how demons seemed drawn to him like moths to flame, Austin had begun to seriously think about leaving the academy.\nAnd today, he was planning to talk to Valerie about that decision.\nAs he stepped into the common hall, a few heads turned.\nSome greeted him with a nod and a faint smile. He returned the gesture with quiet acknowledgment.\nHe could feel the shift in how people looked at him. No longer just a war hero—they saw him as something more now. A protector. A savior.\nThat sat better with him.\nHe scanned the room, and it didn't take long before his eyes settled on a familiar presence.\nA beautiful violet flower, quietly blooming in a corner.\nHe walked over, his steps light, and gently took the seat beside her.\n\"How do you feel?\" he asked softly, leaning just close enough to breathe in the soothing scent that always clung to her.\nShe smelled like vanilla. Warm. Comforting. Like home.\n\"I feel good,\" she said, resting her head on his shoulder. A moment later, she added in a whisper, \"Better now.\"\nAustin reached out and took her hand in his. Then his gaze drifted to the tray in front of her.\n\"You didn't eat much?\" he asked, noting the few leftover salad leaves and nothing else—except two empty cups of black coffee.\nThere was no reply.\nHe glanced at her, only to find her face flushed a deep red.\nShe was blushing—clearly embarrassed.\n\"What is it?\" he asked, both curious and quietly amused.\nValerie lifted her head from his shoulder and placed her hands on the table, fidgeting as if gathering courage.\nThen, in the smallest voice—so soft only someone like him could hear it—she said,\n\"I… I've gained some weight.\"\nHer fingers nervously tapped against each other as she added, \"I could barely buckle my training pants this morning.\"\nAustin blinked, then chuckled gently.\n\"Oh… so that's why you skipped training, huh?\"\nValerie's blush deepened until her whole face glowed red. She leaned forward, letting her head rest on the table, and slowly nodded in response.\nAustin felt something stir in his chest—a strong, playful urge to scoop her up and steal her breath away with a hug.\nAnd he didn't resist it.\nWithout warning, he pulled her into his arms.\n\"Ah!\" she gasped, caught completely off guard by the sudden embrace.\nHeads turned in their direction, curious eyes lingering, but Valerie didn't push him away. Even if every soul in the room was watching, the thought of breaking away from him felt wrong. Almost sinful.\nHer arms hesitated for a second… before wrapping around him gently.\n\"Valerie…\" Austin whispered with a grin, his voice low and warm against her ear, \"This is way too much sugar for breakfast. Can you stop being so adorable?\"\n\"E-Eh?\" she blinked, confused. Her lips parted, but no answer came. What had she done?\nAustin slowly pulled back, just enough to look into her eyes—those soft eyes filled with both confusion and warmth.\n\"I don't mind you putting on a little weight,\" he said, his tone honest, smiling deeply. \"I'll love you all the same.\"\nBut Valerie shook her head, eyes dropping to the table as her fingers curled around the edge.\n\"No,\" she murmured. \"I don't want to…\"\nHer voice trembled slightly—not from fear, but from something more tender.\n\"If I gain weight… I'll move slower. I won't be as sharp.\" She paused, her brows drawing together. \"And… I won't look good standing next to you.\"\nShe didn't say it out loud, but it was clear—Valerie had trained herself to walk in heels just to match his height. She kept herself in perfect shape not just for battle—but so she'd never look out of place beside him.\nSo she'd never be someone he'd feel embarrassed to be seen with.\nAustin reached out and pressed his finger gently against the tip of her nose.\n\"You're overthinking this,\" he said with a small smile. \"I won't speak as a warrior—but as your partner. I don't care how you look. You'll always be my queen.\"\nHe leaned in and placed a soft kiss on her cheek.\nValerie lowered her gaze, her cheeks coloring again, but this time her smile was radiant—sweet and quiet, like dawn light.\nAcross the room, a few students watched the exchange with pained smiles. The early morning had turned into a love story, and for some of them… it was a bit too much.\nToo sweet. Too gentle. Too far from the loneliness they felt.\nAustin gave Valerie's hand a soft squeeze. \"But,\" he added, glancing at her tray, \"you still need to stop skipping real food. Salad and coffee aren't a meal.\"\nBefore she could protest, he stood and made his way toward the food counter.\nJust as he was about to place the order, a voice called out from behind.\n\"Austin.\"\nHe turned and saw a woman from the administration department walking toward him.\nHis brows lifted slightly. \"Yes?\"\n\"A pretty important guest has come to meet you,\" she said, lowering her voice just enough to hint at how significant the visit was. \"He's waiting in the counseling office.\"\nThe way she said it made something click in Austin's mind.\nAh… so it's him.\nHe gave a calm nod. \"Tell him I'll come after breakfast. Let him wait.\"\nThe lady looked surprised, unsure how to respond. \"Can't you just… skip breakfast?\" Her tone was polite, but the urgency was there, plain and clear.\nAustin didn't fault her. From her position, this probably felt like a big deal.\nBut still—\n\"I never invited anyone,\" he said, his voice steady, \"so whoever came should have the patience to wait until I'm done with my own business, no?\"\nThe woman hesitated for a second before nodding slowly. \"Understood. I'll relay the message.\"\nShe turned and left.\nAustin returned to the table carrying two trays, each loaded with a proper breakfast.\nValerie glanced at him, her knife carefully slicing through a piece of meat.\n\"William, I suppose?\" she asked softly, concern lacing her tone.\nAustin let out a slow sigh. \"Didn't expect him to be in such a rush. I heard he wanted to meet me… but this is sooner than I thought.\"\nValerie lowered her fork slightly, then asked in a hesitant voice, \"Do you think I can join?\"\nAustin frowned—not in disapproval, but in disbelief that she even had to ask.\n\"Of course you can,\" he said. \"You're not only my wife… you're also an important asset to this realm.\"\nHis tone held no doubt.\nValerie's heart fluttered as she gave his cheek a soft kiss, and said, \"Thank you.\"\nAustin asked, \"For letting you join me?\"\nValerie softly shook her head in denial, \"For the respect you showed for me.\"\nAustin, smiling, gave her hand a gentle squeeze and said, \"You are and always will be the strongest warrior in my eyes.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thank you for reading.",

      "content": "Valerie and Austin arrived at the counseling office not long after finishing their breakfast—and a bit of playful flirting.\nInside, Charlotte and William were already seated side by side. Across from them sat a familiar figure: the Headmaster.\nAustin gave a respectful nod to the elderly man before turning to the two warriors and acknowledging them with a subtle nod.\n\"I'll leave you four to it, then,\" Philius said as he rose from his seat. On his way out, he gave Austin's shoulder a light tap.\nIt was clear he understood—this was something that couldn't be shared, not even with the man who held the highest authority in the school.\nWilliam silently appreciated the gesture as he looked at the two young ones now sitting across from him.\n\"Char,\" he whispered softly, just before Austin and Valerie could notice Charlotte raising her hand—casting a barrier around them, just in case someone tried to listen in.\nWilliam broke the silence, speaking as if it were just a friendly chat. \"How are you two holding up? I heard you were attacked again.\"\nAustin gave a small nod. \"Yeah, at the beach. I'm guessing you've already seen the report.\"\nWilliam nodded. \"Yes, I did. An ancient being awoke and stood before hundreds of students.\" His gaze drifted into the distance, unfocused, as he finished quietly, \"...I can't even imagine how terrible things might've turned out—if you hadn't been there.\"\nAustin noticed something different about the man. He wasn't the same as when they first met.\nThere was a quiet shift. He felt more human now—less like a hardened warrior born to fight the darkness, and more like someone carrying its weight.\nCharlotte gently placed her hand over William's, offering silent support.\nHe gathered his thoughts and turned his eyes back to Austin. \"I've been meaning to meet you for a while. But after hearing what happened at the beach, I decided it couldn't wait.\"\nAustin frowned slightly. \"Is there something you want to tell me?\"\nWilliam leaned back in his seat and exchanged a glance with Charlotte.\nShe then looked across at Valerie before turning to Austin. \"Are you sure you want her to hear this? What we're about to say could put you in danger, Austin.\"\nThough she hadn't spent much time with them, Charlotte had already picked up on the closeness between Austin and Valerie.\nAnd she knew—what William was about to reveal, and the offer that might follow could very well shake Valerie up and she might influence Austin's decision.\nThat's why she gave the warning.\nBut Austin reached out and held his lover's hand. Without even glancing her way, he said with quiet confidence,\n\"She might worry—but she'd never stop me from doing what needs to be done. So please, go ahead.\"\nValerie gave a soft smile, lowering her eyes for a brief moment before looking up at the two across from her.\n\"Please, tell us what brought you here so urgently.\"\nWilliam had no choice now but to speak.\n\"Three days ago, a small unit was sent to the other side. Following your advice, the Council agreed that inspecting the other side should be their first priority—only then would they make any decisions.\"\nAustin frowned at the revelation but chose not to speak yet.\nWilliam exhaled a weary sigh. \"I told them high-ranking warriors should go with the team, but...\"\n\"They refused,\" Austin finished, his tone sharp. \"Because to them, a soldier's life means next to nothing.\"\nWilliam's expression twisted—but not in disagreement.\nIt was bitterness.\nNot at Austin's words, but at the truth within them.\nCharlotte nodded slowly. \"You're right. They measure a person's worth by how much they contribute to society. That's why they sent fifteen people to the other side—for field inspection.\"\n\"And the result?\" Valerie asked.\nWilliam and Charlotte exchanged a glance before William finally said, \"They died. Slowly… painfully. I went to see it myself.\"\nA heavy silence fell over the room. Grim as it was, Austin and Valerie had expected it. Crossing the SOS without overwhelming strength was a death sentence.\nSome lucky ones made it back—but most didn't.\nAfter a pause, Austin asked, \"Were they captured?\"\nWilliam shook his head. \"We found their remains behind a boulder. Skin burnt… flesh already rotting.\"\nAustin frowned. \"You're sure no demons tortured them and left the bodies like that?\"\nWilliam hesitated. \"I don't think so. No demon kills a human in that way. And more importantly, the location... it was far from any known demonic territory. Why would they leave bodies there?\"\nValerie narrowed her eyes, locking onto him. \"But you know something. Don't you? You wouldn't have come here if you didn't.\"\nShe was right. If William didn't have a strong lead, he would've tried investigating the demon stronghold directly, maybe even calling on his S-rank comrades. But instead, he came here.\nThere had to be a reason.\nWilliam gave a slow nod. \"The reason I didn't stay longer to investigate… was the rain.\"\nHe rolled up his sleeve, revealing large, purplish bruises on his arm—raw and painful as if he'd been struck repeatedly with something corrosive.\nAustin's eyes widened slightly. \"They've deployed poison rain.\"\nValerie turned to him, processing it quickly. \"So they're cautious… like us. They laid a trap in case anyone from our side tried to enter.\"\nAustin gave a short hum of agreement. \"And the sorcerer behind it can likely keep that rain going for years. Which means… either we charge through it and get torn apart, or we wait for them to come.\"\nCharlotte frowned. \"What sorcerer?\"\nWilliam and Valerie looked just as puzzled, their eyes now focused on the blond prince.\nAustin hesitated. He hadn't planned to reveal what he knew—because the knowledge came from his past self.\nBut these people needed to understand what they were up against.\nWith a serious tone, he began, \"The demon realm isn't in a separate dimension. It exists on the same planet as ours. That means they can't avoid the sun's natural cycle.\"\nHe paused before continuing.\n\"Demons are weak under sunlight,\" Austin said, his voice calm but steady. \"The sun dulls their senses, forces them to conserve energy just to survive. That's why there's a sorcerer whose sole task, since the moment of its birth, has been to cover the skies in cloud. It uses blood and dark water to thicken those clouds—making them dense, heavy… and perfect for the demons to thrive beneath.\"\nThe others fell silent, taking in the weight of that revelation.\nCharlotte was the first to break it. She let out a dry chuckle, then said with a wry smile, \"I always thought the skies were mourning. That all the lives they'd taken had left a stain on the heavens.\"\n\"You weren't the only one,\" William added softly. \"I believed something similar.\"\nAustin gave a short nod. \"That same sorcerer is behind the acid rain. It's a warning… a trap to keep us away from their side.\"\n\"But that won't stop the Council from sending more troops,\" Charlotte said grimly.\nValerie's brows knit together. \"What do you mean?\" Her voice was calm, but there was a sharp edge buried underneath.\nCharlotte sighed. \"What can I say…? The Council is full of people who believe sacrifices are necessary for humanity's progress.\"\nAustin's eyes narrowed. \"You mean to say… they're still planning to send soldiers? Even after what happened?\"\nCharlotte nodded. \"Yes. They know. And they're doing it anyway.\"\nAustin clenched his jaw. The tension in the room deepened.\nThat's when William leaned forward, his voice low but urgent. \"That's why I came here. I want your help to stop this madness.\"\nHe was trying to keep his tone level, but Austin could sense the strain beneath it.\nThe blond prince leaned back in his chair, arms folded. \"I always thought you worshipped the Council,\" he said plainly. \"Guess I misjudged you.\"\nWilliam let his arms rest on his knees, staring at the table. \"To be honest… a few months ago, I wouldn't have come. I would've followed orders without question, trusting the Council to somehow fix everything.\"\nHe took a breath, then clenched his fists.\n\"But after what happened that day… seeing all those soldiers die… crying for help, writhing in pain—no one came. Their voices still echo in my head. Their eyes… the families they left behind… I can't forget them.\"\nValerie's gaze softened as she looked at him, then at Austin.\nAustin squeezed her hand gently before speaking, \"And you know what's worse? We'll keep seeing that… again and again… unless we do something.\"\nWilliam raised his head. His eyes had a new resolve in them.\n\"You're right,\" he said firmly. \"That's why I'm here. I need your help. We can't just wait anymore.\"\nHe straightened up, voice tightening.\n\"This time… we strike first. And strike hard.\" William was going against the Council. However, his intentions were pure and selfless that's why he wasn't hesitating.\nHe has to stop their madness by purging the evil.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "[A few days later]\nRhea sat quietly in the gymnasium, half-hidden under the dim lights.\nShe was barely visible—just a shadow in the silence.\nBoth her hands were held—wrapped in warmth from two different men.\nLately, she had been spending more and more time with them, seeking their presence whenever the restlessness returned.\nOn her left was the Professor—the one who helped her reunite with her hometown, who stood by her when Rudolph left.\nOn her right was the man she once swore never to forgive.\nBut time had taken a strange turn… and here they were.\nClose. Quiet. Intimate.\nBoth had known Rudolph.\nBoth understood the ache she carried.\nWhen she spoke of facing the Demon Lord, they didn't stop her.\nThey stood with her.\nA moment passed. Then Rhea whispered, eyes lost in the distance—\n\"I think I should visit the other side now.\"\nShe felt the grip on her hands tighten—both of them anxious.\n\"The Council is working on a strategy,\" Parkinson said, his voice careful.\n\"Wait for them to come up with a plan?\"\n\"I'd never suggest you act recklessly,\" Morkel added, adjusting his glasses.\nRhea chuckled softly.\n\"I know. If either of you had the chance to lock me away just to keep me safe, you wouldn't hesitate for a second.\"\nParkinson turned a shade pink.\nMorkel said nothing—but didn't deny it either.\nIt was true.\nThey would do anything to protect her, even if it meant risking their own lives.\nBut Rhea's gaze didn't waver.\n\"You must understand… I have to face this danger. I know it'll hurt you, but this is a fate I can't—and won't—run from.\"\nShe wasn't pushing them away.\nShe simply refused to abandon the dream she had always carried—\nA world where peace wasn't a fantasy.\nAnd for that…\nShe would have to eradicate every last demon.\nMorkel exchanged a glance with Parkinson, but before either of them could speak, a fourth presence entered the space.\n\"Rhea—oh.\"\nAustin blinked, surprised to see two men flanking her.\nParkinson met his gaze—and for a heartbeat, the world went still.\nNeither had forgotten what happened a year ago.\nThe humiliation Parkinson endured for something he didn't do.\nThe cold hatred in Rhea's eyes back then.\nHe remembered it all.\n\"Park,\" Rhea gently squeezed his hand.\nHis aura had shifted—and her eyes, now cold and unreadable, made one thing clear:\nIf he made a move, she knew where she stood.\nAustin, meanwhile, stayed perfectly calm.\nNo fear. No guilt.\nHe had long buried that chapter.\nParkinson rose to his feet—and so did Rhea, ready to intervene if needed.\nBut all he did…\nWas bow.\n\"I'm grateful,\" he said quietly, \"for saving Rhea's life. Not once, but twice. I can't thank you enough.\"\nAustin exhaled.\nJust as he thought—Parkinson chose Rhea over pride.\n\"I only saved my friend,\" he said with a casual shrug.\n\"It had nothing to do with you.\"\nParkinson lifted his head.\n\"It's the result that matters. So… thank you.\"\nAustin gave a small nod, then turned to Rhea.\n\"Got a moment? It's important.\"\nShe didn't hesitate.\nIf he came looking for her, it wasn't for idle talk.\nTurning to the two men, she said softly,\n\"I'll… see you both tomorrow. Parkinson, be safe on your way out.\"\nHe nodded.\nMoments later, Rhea jumped over the guard rail, landing beside Austin.\n\"Lead the way,\" she said.\nMorkel watched them walk away, sighing under his breath.\n\"This sight would've torn me apart in the past... but now…\"\n...\nAustin and Rhea stepped out of the gym together.\nThey walked in silence… but not for long.\n\"So, you and those two… are like… together now?\" Austin asked, breaking the quiet.\nRhea blushed faintly as if she'd been waiting for that question.\nLowering her head, she said softly, \"I don't know… I can't be sure. I like them—more than just a teacher or a friend—but we haven't made anything official.\"\nAustin nodded with a hum. \"Take your time. They care about you a lot. And they deserve someone who gives them the same care back.\"\nRhea smiled a little. These days, Austin had become like a good friend to her—someone who spoke honestly and never beat around the bush. She trusted that.\nAnother moment of quiet passed before her gentle, unsure voice rose again.\n\"...Do you think I'm betraying Rudolph?\"\nAustin hadn't expected that. He glanced at her, surprised.\nHer head was down, eyes filled with a tangle of emotions.\n\"For loving someone else?\" Austin asked. \"No. I don't think you're cheating on him.\"\nHis voice was steady as he continued, \"You're not moving on like he meant nothing. You remember him—his words, his feelings. That's loyalty, Rhea. Not betrayal.\"\nHer eyes lit up a little with that answer. \"Then… what does it mean? Loving someone else when Rudolph is still in my heart?\"\nShe sounded eager now, desperate for a truth she could hold onto.\nAustin didn't flinch. \"Rudolph never wanted you to live in sorrow. He wanted you to smile again. And if those two make you feel safe—make you feel alive—then it's no crime to hold their hands.\"\nHe looked directly into her eyes and said, \"You deserve to be happy, Rhea.\"\n*Ba Dum*\nHer heart skipped a beat.\nShe didn't know why.\nLowering her gaze again, a soft smile slowly bloomed on her lips. She didn't reply. She didn't need to.\nSomehow, Austin's words made her feel like she wasn't doing anything wrong.\nAnd for the first time, she found the courage not to push Parkinson and Morkel away.\nMaybe it was the way Austin spoke or the way he stood by her without judging—that made her start seeing him as something more than a friend.\nA quiet guardian.\nSomeone who would always guide her toward what's right.\nAnd for that… she was deeply thankful.\nSoon, they reached Austin's office. Rhea had no trouble slipping past the security and stepping inside, just like in old times.\n\"It's been so long…\" she said, her face lighting up with a smile.\nBefore the incident with Valerie, Rhea used to sneak in often—just to relax and spend time with Austin. She loved being here, even if she wasn't much help with the calculations. The room held so many quiet, comforting memories.\nThose memories came flooding back—until a cold voice cut through the warmth.\n\"Don't get too familiar. You're not allowed here unless he invites you.\"\nValerie's tone was sharp, her eyes cool.\nRhea offered a wry smile, dipping her head in acknowledgment. \"I won't cross any lines. Don't worry.\"\nAustin leaned over and kissed Valerie's cheek, feeling a rush of love seeing her being jealous, before pointing to the chair across from them. \"Sit.\"\nRhea took the seat, her fingers folding in her lap. \"So… how are you now, Valerie? Recovered?\"\nValerie nodded calmly. \"A while ago. I just needed some mental rest.\"\nRhea nodded slowly. \"Same here… The presence of that being was terrifying. I've never felt anything like it.\"\nNot even the Demonic General they faced during the war had an aura that overwhelming. Maybe because that one had split his body apart—but the turtle's presence… it was earth-shattering.\nAustin leaned forward. \"Did you go for counseling?\"\n\"Yeah, I did… and it helped.\"\nAustin grinned, a teasing glint in his eyes. \"I bet it did. I'm sure Professor Morkel has a few special methods of comforting you.\"\nRhea blushed, eyes widening as she stared at him. \"H-How did you know?!\"\nAustin chuckled. \"Let's not go there.\"\nValerie groaned and rubbed her thumbs together, trying to keep her cool.\nAfter a brief pause, Austin finally spoke.\n\"Rhea… William came to meet me recently.\"\nRhea stiffened at the name. Her eyes narrowed, and a frown crept onto her face. \"The strongest warrior… Did something happen?\"\nAustin nodded. \"The Council's been sending soldiers to investigate the other side. But they're only coming back in body bags. At this rate, they'll stop trying altogether and just wait for another attack.\"\n\"Just like they always do,\" Valerie muttered under her breath.\nRhea clenched her fists. \"Why are they throwing people away like this? Couldn't they have sent someone strong across?\"\n\"I asked the same thing,\" Austin said, his voice low. \"But you know how the Council is—they divide people by strength. And those they see as weak… are expendable.\"\nRhea scoffed, anger flashing in her eyes. \"They're murderers. Nothing more.\"\nAustin leaned back in his seat, \"That's why William came here with a proposal...he suggested launching an attack—just he and me-\"\n\"I will come too,\" Rhea instantly added, her eyes ablaze with determination.\nAustin expected much, however, \"Before I take you there I want you to know a few things about yourself.\"\nRhea was surprised by the shift of conversation but she didn't ask any questions and nodded at him to continue.\nAustin took a moment before revealing, \"Rhea...you are the successor of a legendary warrior. Someone whom every single human knows.\"\nWith his gaze turning serious, he added, \"You possess the blood of none else but Hero Kane.\"\n\"...!!\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "It took some time for Rhea to calm down. But once Austin shared bits of his past—and hers—she began to believe him.\n\"So you're saying… my great-great-grandfather was the legendary Hero Kane? The one who wiped out darkness and sealed the Demon Lord?\" It would've sounded ridiculous if anyone else had said it.\nAustin gave a steady nod. \"Yes. I was there with him. And I know you're connected to him because you both carry the same Shards.\"\nThere were too many things Rhea didn't understand, so she took a deep breath, organized her thoughts, and asked, \"Tell me something… Why were you there? A thousand years ago? Fighting demons with my ancestor?\"\nShe couldn't recall hearing about any Shard that could send someone so far into the past. And even if such a thing existed—why would Austin take such a risk?\nAustin let out a slow sigh. \"It's a long story… but I'll try to keep it simple.\" He paused for a moment, then continued, \"There was another version of me—an alternate self. He was stronger than I am now. Stronger than all the S-ranks of this world combined.\"\nRhea's eyes widened. Is someone stronger than this version of Austin?\nBut he didn't wait for her reaction and kept going. \"He traveled to the past and fought side by side with the warriors we now call Heroes.\"\nValerie sat nearby, feeling like her Lord was leaving out far too many details. She's not going to believe him with just that, she thought.\nBut Rhea simply nodded and said, \"…I get it now. Your other self probably got bored and decided to challenge the demons when they were at their strongest.\"\n\"…\"\nValerie stared at her in shock. How… how did she guess that? Just like that?\nAustin chuckled. \"You're absolutely right. But even with warriors like Kane and Johny, we couldn't completely destroy the evil God. That's why this version of me was created—to slowly regain that lost strength and figure out how to finally end all this chaos.\"\nRhea gave a small hum. \"That explains why someone who didn't even evolve until a few months ago can now fight a catastrophe-ranked being.\"\nShe said it casually, nodding to herself.\nAustin gave a quiet nod in return, thankful she could understand so much without needing every little detail.\n\"So, like… do I get some kind of power-up or something too?\" Rhea asked with a sheepish smile. After all, she was related to the legendary Hero Kane. And Austin—who was in a vaguely similar situation—had powers beyond belief. It only made sense that she'd get a legendary weapon or at least a cool upgrade, right?\nAustin let out a soft chuckle. \"No, Rhea. You don't get anything without effort.\"\nHis easy laugh made her cheeks flush. She looked away with a little huff. Of course. No free lunch.\n\"But,\" he added, \"you do have the potential to become as strong as the strongest General. You just haven't awakened it yet. And you already have some buffs—you must've noticed by now.\"\nRhea blinked. \"Buffs? Like… what?\"\nAustin paused, then asked thoughtfully, \"Have you ever been poisoned? Or fallen seriously ill?\"\nRhea tilted her head, thinking back. \"No… not that I remember. Wait—are you saying I'm immune to poison and sickness?\"\nAustin nodded. \"Unless someone crafts a poison specifically for you, nothing else—no matter how deadly—can kill you.\"\nRhea frowned slightly, then slowly nodded as something clicked. \"That explains it. Back during the war, that creature bit Valerie and she nearly died… but when it attacked me, I felt nothing.\"\nAustin gave a soft nod. \"Exactly. That wasn't luck. It was your bloodline.\"\nRhea leaned back in her seat, eyes drifting toward the ceiling. \"It's strange… and kind of shameful—that I never realized something so important about my own bloodline.\"\nThere was a softness in her voice. A quiet regret.\nShe had always been so focused on getting stronger—pushing harder, training longer—that she never stopped to truly understand herself. Never once did she pause to wonder what was already within her.\nOnly when she began preparing for the tournament did she start to uncover the truth about her Second Shard. And even then… it felt like she was only scratching the surface.\nWas all her training truly leading somewhere?\nOr was she just swinging her blade over and over—moving forward without direction, chasing strength without understanding it?\nThe questions lingered in her heart, heavier than any weapon she'd ever lifted.\n\"Rhea,\" Valerie's voice called softly, snapping the pink-haired girl out of her daze.\nThe violet-eyed warrior spoke calmly, \"Blaming yourself or looking back with regret will only lead to more mistakes. It's not your fault for not understanding everything about yourself. We're still just teenagers—it's okay to not have all the answers.\"\nRhea blinked in surprise. Valerie's tone held a warmth she wasn't used to. For the first time, it felt like Valerie's concern wasn't just for Austin… but for her.\nTaking a deep breath, Rhea gave a small nod. \"You're right… I've been getting emotional over small things.\"\nThen she turned to Austin, her expression steadier now. \"So, when are we leaving? And what's the plan?\"\nAustin didn't take long to answer. \"We haven't fixed a date yet. But as for the plan—our goal is simple. We're going to crush the Succubus Queen and her army.\"\nThe moment the name left his mouth, Valerie flinched.\nAustin noticed. Of course, he did. He knew exactly why she reacted that way.\nWithout a word, he reached out and placed his hand gently over hers, a silent promise that he was with her—and he wasn't going anywhere.\nMeanwhile, Rhea frowned. \"Isn't she the same one who attacked us not long ago?\"\nAustin nodded. \"Yes. And since I destroyed a large part of her soul back then, she's still weak. Bleeding. That's why now's the time to strike.\"\nRhea slowly nodded. \"You're right. They have thousands under their command… but if we take out three of the four Generals, the rest will be leaderless. It'll cause chaos in their ranks.\"\nAustin gave a low hum. \"Exactly. But that's not all—we need to wipe out as many demons as we can. Even if it's just one percent of their forces… we must exterminate them.\"\nA sharp glint flickered in Rhea's eyes as a grin spread across her face. \"Delighted to hear that. I've been training for this my whole life… and now, I finally get to fulfill my dream.\"\n....\nValerie and Austin returned to his room, while Rhea quietly made her way back to her dorm.\nValerie headed straight to the bathroom to take a bath. Naturally, she had her clothes here—most nights, she stayed in Austin's room anyway.\nMeanwhile, Austin sat at the table, focused on a blank sheet of paper. A charcoal pencil in hand, he was slowly sketching out a map of the demon realm.\nHis only source? Memory.\nHe had spent enough time wandering the demon lands in the past—seeking out warriors strong enough to challenge him. That reckless pursuit had given him a rough understanding of the terrain, the outposts, and the major strongholds.\nAs his hand traced mountain lines and valley curves, his thoughts shifted elsewhere.\n'How are you doing?' he asked the system in his mind. 'You've been quiet. No quests lately?'\nIt had been a while since the last one. Ever since he ascended to the next stage, he had only completed five quests in total. And none of them had taken him to a dungeon.\nNot even one dungeon after ascending, he thought with a sigh. That was his only regret.\nOr maybe… it wasn't just the lack of opportunity.\nMaybe he was getting a little lazy these days.\nJust a little.\n[I am doing good, Host! And about Quest, then a big and fruitful one is about to be assigned.]\nSaid the System.\nHmm~Austin realized that it must be related to the quest he had taken.\n'It must be related to the demonic army...' He thought as he drew the checkposts he remembered about the General Succubus.\nHe kept working until he heard the door of the bathroom parting.\nAustin rested the pencil, and while holding the map he turned towards her and said , \"I might be wrong but this...\" But then, he paused.\nThe map from his hand fell to the ground.\nHis lips parted in awe and shock as he saw the woman of his dreams standing before him in an unusual attire\nShe wore black lingerie—smooth, thin fabric with little lace—that hugged her body in all the right places. It showed off her curves and made her look both beautiful and tempting.\nHer violet hair was still a bit damp, with strands sticking gently to her neck and shoulders. One piece of hair hung over her eye, giving her a wild and soft look at the same time. She looked like someone who had just stepped out of a dream.\nTwo thin strings barely held her bust, and the see-through lacy panty made his mouth water, and blood began to rush down.\nShe didn't need to try. She didn't pose or fake it. Just the way she stood there, the way her hips moved a little when she walked, and the way her hand ran through her wet hair—it was more than enough to make anyone's heart race.\nShe slowly approached him, looking up at him with a blushing face.\nAustin didn't need to say or ask anything.\nHe held her hand and brought her to the bed.\nIt's finally time to let his inner beast take over.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- How nice it would be to skip the lemons~\nDrop a comment.",

Again, skip it since this chapter doesn't contain any material to the main story. You have been warned~\n.....\nAustin had been thought of this day for quite a long time. After all, it wasn't a crime to lust over the person you love. And he knew that Valerie was eager to explore the territory they had been avoiding until now.\nThat's why, when she offered herself to him, he didn't make any excuse or held any intentions of stopping mid-way today.\nThe light was dim in the room. The curtains were drawn and the door was locked.\nThe temperature of the room was rising as the two individuals felt heat rushing down their bodies every time their lips met.\nHis lips crashed onto hers with a hunger he didn't try to hide. Valerie gasped softly, but didn't resist—she melted into him, wrapping her arms around his neck as her body pressed into his chest.\nHis hands slid over her waist, fingers trailing up her back, slow and deliberate, feeling the heat beneath the thin fabric.\nValerie tugged his shirt, pulling him closer—closer until there was nothing between them but flames.\nHis lips parted from hers, looking at her intoxicated eyes and how roughly she was breathing. Everything about her tore his sanity slowly, making him eager to do something that he could only do to her.\nHis lips attacked her again, this time her neck, biting just enough to leave her breath catching in her throat. Her fingers tangled in his hair as he touched her lower back, moving in ways that made her shiver.\nHer legs brushed against his as they moved, step by step, toward the bed.\nHe kissed her again—slower this time, deeper. His hand wandered over her curves, learning her all over again, like every inch of her skin was his to explore.\nHis left hand cupped her behind, squeezing it gently and making her moan.\n\"Nngh...it...feels strange...\" She said, her eyes closed and her head leaning back.\nAustin felt heat rushing down his body, gathering between his legs. He was hot for this woman. He craved for her.\n\"Ah...\" Valerie softly yelped as she found herself being lifted and carried to the bed.\nAustin sat on the bed with his woman on his lap.\nTheir hips connected and her legs loosely locked around his waist.\nThey stared into each other's eyes, their breath steaming hot.\n\"Valerie...I love you.\" He confessed, not the first time, but every time, it felt like it wasn't enough.\nShe leaned closer and planted a soft kiss at the corner of his lips before huskily whispering, \"I love you too...more than anything.\"\nHer words were expected but still, they made him feel exhilarated.\nHis hands went inside her lingerie as his lips found hers once again, in a bruising kiss.\nThe sound of their lip-locking resonated in the room as if a traveler had finally found an oasis in a desert. They were thirsty for each other.\n\"Angh...so rough...\" She moaned in his mouth as Austin inserted his hand inside her lingerie and squeezed her ass.\nThey were soft and springy, moulding in the shape he desired and turning back to their original shape the moment he let go.\nWhy is she so soft? He so wants to eat her now.\n\"You drive me crazy..\" he said with a growl, sniffing her neck and making her shiver.\nValerie leaned her head back, giving him better access as she felt something between her legs tingling.\nAustin suddenly got up and gently laid her on the bed.\nValerie blushed upon seeing her Lord slowly removing his buttons, revealing his bare chest and chiseled abs as he said, \"I haven't taken a bath...will that be okay?\"\nShe hurriedly nodded, not wanting this scene to disappear.\nAustin grinned as he threw his shirt on the chair and extended his arm.\n\"Like what you see?\" He asked.\nValerie hurriedly nodded again, feeling her throat turning dry.\n\"Want to touch me?\" He asked, drawing closer to her.\nShe felt her heart race elevating as she took a strong gulp and slowly rose from the bed.\n\"Go ahead, I am all yours~\" He tempted her, standing near the bed with his hands on his side.\nValerie slowly brought her fingers and touched his burning skin.\nIt was hard and tight...carved from hours of training and hard work.\nHer fingers trailed down his well-carved abs, making him groan.\nHer eyes then landed on something that made her hesitate.\nSomething was bulging in his pants.\nShe looked up at her Lord and found him looking down at her with a challenging look.\nGathering all her courage, she moved her hand down, and finally....her hand touched his sex.\nAustin took a sharp breath...her soft hand was on his thing right now...the sight of her innocent eyes and curious hand exploring his heated rod was too erotic.\n\"Go ahead and see the real thing,\" he suggested.\nValerie was very much curious...so she slowly unbuckled his pants and pulled them down—\n\"Ah!\"\n—only to yelp in surprise upon seeing it for the first time in her life.\nSomething big...hot and extruding such a strong scent...it made her head dizzy.\nValerie took a short sniff and the tingly sensation intensified between her thighs. She involuntarily rubbed her thighs together and raised her hand to hold his thing.\nThe moment she touched his thing, Austin groaned... this was too much.\n\"Valerie,\" he pushed her onto the bed after throwing away his pants and ripped her lingerie smoothly.\nShe didn't protest. She can feel the hunger in his gaze. He wanted her, as much as she wanted him.\n\"Ah...slow...sensitive...\" She warned him as his tongue attacked the pink buds on her chest.\nHis tongue swirled around her pink areola before he gave a soft bite to her bud. His fingers trailed down her stomach and slid inside her panty.\nThe heat he felt while he smoothly glided down her pelvis was tempting.\n\"Nngh...Aus...ah...\" She felt breathless, her back arching as his fingers touched the spot where no one had touched before.\n\"You are wet ...do you want me?\" He whispered, his fingers softly massaging her petals. She was flooding down there, her panty damp and her small puckering hole waiting for him to enter her.\nShe held his shoulder and softly nodded, \"Yes...make me yours.\"\nHe knew that she would say it, yet hearing it from her sent a thrill running down his body.\nHe positioned his thing against her entrance.\nValerie held her breath feeling the heat touching her skin.\n\"Tell me if it hurts...\" He faintly whispered before pushing himself up a little, his manhood entering her.\nValerie bit her lips, her brows drawing closer as she felt something foreign entering inside her. A very uncomfortable feeling crept down her spine.\nAustin noticed her unease so he took things slow and kissed her lips tenderly, \"Don't worry, I am here...it will hurt just a little.\" He assured her as he caressed her face and comforted her in every possible way.\nHis faint breathing, his sturdy arms, and his body warmth eased her a little as she relaxed her body and felt his thing slowly penetrating her.\nAustin didn't rush things despite what his inner self demanded.\nHer inner walls were clinging to him, desperate to squeeze his thing and devour his juice. But he held back and continued to comfort his girl.\n\"Is it in?\" She anxiously asked, feeling as if he had reached her navel.\nAustin helplessly smiled as he looked down and found he was halfway through.\nKissing on her brow, he said, \"Just a little more...you can do it.\" He encouraged her and showered her face with kisses.\nShe moaned in delight and Austin finally reached her deepest part.\nThey both breathed roughly, taking a moment to feel this sensation.\nValerie shyly looked down and said, \"We...ah...are finally connected...\"\nAustin grinned as he held her hand and interlaced his fingers with her before pulling away slowly.\nIt felt as if her insides were desperately holding him in.\nAustin was careful not to hurt her, so he did things slowly.\nHis waist began to move, pushing inside and pulling out in a rhythmic motion.\nHer big mounds swayed with each thrust, making him eager to feast on them.\nTheir hips collided as Austin kept moving his waist and enjoyed her baby hole devouring his thing.\nSlowly, the pain receded, not disappeared, but it was better now.\nShe held his shoulders and closed her eyes to focus on the sensation she was experiencing for the first time.\nAustin kept moving, his pace gradually increasing.\nThe sound of their mating softly echoed through the room along with her soft moans.\n\"Ah...hmm...mm...nngh...\" She tried suppressing the vulgar sounds she was letting out but she failed miserably.\nIt had started to feel better and better...to the point she was scared.\n\"Valerie...look at me...\" He urged, holding her face.\nShe was breathing roughly, her body jerked with each thrust but she looked at him.\n\"I am close...\"\n\"Yes...please...I want this...\" She hugged his back and felt a very unfamiliar sensation assaulting her. She felt happy and excited at the same time.\nAustin had been holding back for a long time so he soon felt on the verge of giving up.\n\"Valerie...I am about to...\" He groaned, wanting to pull out since he wasn't wearing a condom.\nBut just as he was about to pull, Valerie crossed her legs behind his back and pulled him towards her.\n\"Fuck!\" He cursed as he lost control and his soon relief washed over him as he shot everything he had been packing.\nValerie felt hot inside her...the seed of her Lord...ah, so warm...so happy.\nThey remained like that for a few moments before Austin slowly parted from her.\nHe looked at the girl before telling her, \"We are getting you pills tomorrow.\"\n\"...\" What's the point then?!\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- I really suck at gentle sex! I mean I don't find that thrill. Agh, the next one will be better.\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"You…want a blueberry sandwich?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Some black coffee?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Maybe a back rub?\"\n\"No, thanks.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh. This was one of those rare occasions when Valerie was ignoring him on purpose and even reluctant to look at him.\nThey were in his room, doing nothing.\nValerie was reading a book by the window, her back facing him. Austin was feeling helpless in the situation.\nThey had been like this ever since he forced her to drink the pregnancy-prevention potion.\nIt was, surprisingly, available in a huge amount in the infirmary. And the nurse was so understanding that Austin didn't have to explain anything.\nValerie was reluctant to drink it, tried to escape, and even fought him. But in the end, Austin made her drink it.\nAnd now, she was giving him the cold shoulder, as if he had killed her unborn baby.\nHe knew her cycle, so he was aware that she wasn't ovulating around this time. But still, he didn't want to take risks.\nAnd now that he had dealt with the possible pregnancy, he had to coax his beloved somehow.\nSlowly approaching her, Austin hugged her neck and closed her book.\nSoftly, he whispered, \"Are you really going to be angry with your Lord? I feel lonely, you know.\"\nShe still didn't turn to look at him. Being stubborn.\nAustin kissed her cheek tenderly, \"You know why you can't have a baby, right? You are my comrade and my teacher. So until we don't get rid of the only threat that could destroy our livelihood, we should refrain from having an addition to this family.\"\nTilting his head to look into her eyes, he added, \"After all, we don't want our little one to face the plague of the world, right?\"\nWhat he said was rational and practical. The war was looming over their heads, and any day now, they would be facing the demon lord on the battlefield.\nValerie was also a part of the group that would be trespassing into their territory with William and the others. So, she has to maintain her health for the time being.\nValerie acknowledges that but still, \"Couldn't you have let me live with that sensation for at least a day? You brought the potion right away.\" She complained, her thin brows drawing closer.\nAustin chuckled, \"I promise once we end this war, you can live with that sensation for nine months.\"\nValerie blushed at those words but still moved her eyes away from him. Still upset.\nAustin exhaled a sigh and got back up.\nValerie thought that she might have annoyed him but before she could have turned to look, she found him kneeling before her.\nAustin held her hand and told her, \"I promise this on my life, Valerie, that after I erase the being named Astaroth from this world, I will make a peaceful world for you. Not a single extra person, just you, me, and our children.\"\nHe kissed her hands and looked up at her.\nHe found elation and excitement in her eyes.\nAustin could feel how much she was looking forward to that day when they could stop being warriors and enjoy their time as a normal couple.\nHowever, to reach paradise they have to cross several hurdles and overcome dozens of obstacles.\nThe violette cupped his cheeks and told him, \"Sorry for troubling you. I won't be mad anymore.\"\nAustin moved and Valerie leaned forward.\nTheir lips met in a gentle kiss. It was nothing like last night. Their lips met in a few gentle kisses before Austin got up and took the role of brewing coffee for his beloved.\nAs he rested the pot on the boiler, he asked her, \"Does it still hurt?\" Although they did it only once, it was her first time, and Austin could tell that Valerie was in quite pain in the morning too.\nValerie felt slightly shy remembering last night, as she softly shook her head, \"Not much. I will recover by night.\"\nAustin grinned, \"But then...I might make you relive the pain again tonight.\"\nHer blush intensified as she moved her gaze away, this time in embarrassment...and excitement.\n....\nA few days had passed since then.\nAustin had been waiting to hear from William.\nThe Hero wanted to make sure no other battalion had crossed over while they were preparing. So he was taking his time to confirm everything.\nBut Austin was getting a little impatient. Yesterday, he sent a letter through WarpMail, urging that they attack while the Queen was still weak.\nThey still didn't know the Demon Lord's current state. A week ago, Selner mentioned that his upper body had healed and he was able to speak again. For all they knew, he could launch some indirect attack while they were focused on the Succubus Queen.\nAustin had a feeling things wouldn't go as planned. So they needed to stay ready for anything.\nCurrently, Austin was on his way to the arena where his rank evaluation was about to begin.\nThe Headmaster had arranged everything, and the council had quickly sent their officers for the assessment.\n\"Nervous?\" asked a soft voice beside him—Valerie.\nAustin gave a faint smile. \"I would've been… a few months ago.\"\nValerie smirked playfully. \"Because you're confident in your skills now?\"\nHe shook his head. \"No. Because I just don't care\nanymore.\"\nTo him, ranks meant nothing. What truly mattered was what someone could give back to the world—and Austin knew his worth.\nThis evaluation was just to remove the D-rank label, making it easier to buy potions and weapons in the future.\nAs they stepped into the indoor gymnasium, Austin suddenly stopped.\nHe blinked in surprise.\n\"What...the...hell?\"\nThis wasn't some quiet, standard test. The stands were packed. The noise was deafening. Students filled every seat, buzzing with excitement.\nValerie grinned at the sight. \"Looks like everyone wants to see their savior's big moment.\"\nAustin let out a low grumble. Great. Now the pressure was even worse.\nHe sighed and walked toward the officials waiting near the Headmaster.\nValerie stayed behind, stopping a few steps away.\nAustin turned back, leaned in, and gave her a soft kiss on the lips. \"Wish me luck.\"\nA beautiful smile lit up her face. \"Do your best.\"\nThe crowd roared, their cheers shaking the arena.\nA year ago, he had been a nobody—aside from being a prince. No one came to watch his spars. Students hated being paired with him in duels.\nBut now... everything had changed.\nAustin stopped in front of the two men who would be conducting his assessment.\nThey exchanged polite greetings before the Headmaster took a few steps back, joining Valerie at a safe distance.\nThe first officer, a man with light brown hair and glasses, stepped forward. \"Can we see your Shard? We'll start by checking how much Soul Energy you possess.\" He gestured toward a device they had brought with them.\nIt was a clear, cylindrical tube connected to a meter. One simply had to insert their Shard inside, and the device would measure the Soul Energy stored within.\nAustin noticed the rankings marked on the meter—0 to 25 were labeled 'E,' while the highest, 3000 to 5000, was marked as 'S.'\nOut of curiosity, he asked, \"What was William's score?\"\nThe second officer, a younger man, replied, \"When we tested him, we had to upgrade the machine. The new limit—five thousand—was set because of him.\"\nAustin sighed. \"Then you might want to again raise that limit,\" he said as he summoned Scar.\nThe moment he placed the sword inside the device, the arena fell completely silent. The meter began to rise—fast. Eyes locked on the needle as it shot upward at a furious pace.\nThen—\nBZZZZT\nThe machine flickered, turned red, and stopped working altogether. It had overloaded.\nAustin looked at the two officers. Their mouths were slightly open, eyes wide in disbelief, still staring at the now-useless device.\nHe calmly retrieved his Shard and said, \"There's no device that can measure Scar's potential, sir. It grows with every battle. So... let's move on to the next test.\"\nThe officers exchanged glances, then gave a slow nod. \"Alright, then.\"\nAustin was asked to wait a few minutes while students helped set up the next challenge—forty advanced battle dolls, each placed at a fair distance from one another to prevent him from striking multiple targets at once.\nThe crowd buzzed with anticipation, eager to see how many of them their favorite warrior could defeat.\nAustin moved to the sidelines where Valerie stood.\n\"How many did you take down, Val?\" he asked, glancing at her.\nShe hummed in thought before answering, \"Twenty-six.\"\n\"Hm? Just that? Are they really that tough?\"\nValerie nodded. \"They're built from much stronger materials than normal ones. Plus, they're enchanted to boost their senses and defense systems. It's no joke.\"\nAustin grinned, \"This sounds fun.\"\nHe stepped forward, Scar appearing in his hands as he decided to let others witness a glimpse of his true strength.\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "[Valerie's POV:]\nAside from his parents and Sebastian, I'm one of the few who've known him since he was little.\nI was there when he shut himself off from the world—because he knew exactly how people looked at him.\nI saw the moment he chose to stop hiding, to stop running, and to start working toward a better life.\nAnd now, I'm here, watching him shine.\nYes, I felt a little jealous seeing the girls cheer and squeal for him… but the pride I felt watching the students support him drowned out every bit of that jealousy.\nMy chest tightened, and a smile stayed on my face the whole time.\nHe never cared about what people thought of him. But every time someone called him weak or mocked him, it felt like they were stabbing the most fragile part of me.\nI hated every single one of them. And I didn't just hate—I fought back. I hurt more than a few who dared to treat him like he was anything less than someone worthy of love and respect.\nBut now… I don't have to protect him anymore.\nHe's strong enough to defend his name, to stand tall, and to build a reputation that makes people think twice before crossing him.\nI've been a witness to every step of his journey.\nAnd now—I'm watching him rise to the top.\n....\n[Third Person POV:]\nAustin moved about the battlefield like a phantom, appearing at one point, and in the next instance, he slashed his blade several meters away.\nThe cause of his urgency wasn't just to get the best scores but also the quest he received from the system,\n[Destroy all the training dolls within ninety seconds.]\nAustin spun to the side, dodging a wooden staff that swung straight at his head. In a blur, Scar shifted into a spear. He drove it through the training doll's chest, then yanked it back as the puppet collapsed into pieces.\nBefore the next one could move, Scar twisted into twin blades. Austin leaped forward, slashing the doll's arms off mid-attack and kicking its head clean off.\nGasps echoed through the indoor gymnasium.\n\"Whoa… did you see that?\"\n\"He's not even trying—he's just playing with them!\"\n\"Is that weapon alive or what?!\"\nAustin turned, eyes locked on the last two dolls. Scar morphed again, this time into a heavy axe. He dodged low, then swung upward. One doll exploded on impact, the other barely raised its arm before it was split in two.\nSilence followed—then thunderous claps and loud cheering.\n\"That was insane!\"\n\"He didn't get hit even once!\"\nA group of five dolls advanced at once. Austin grinned. Scar twisted into a glaive. With fluid steps, he dashed forward, slicing through the middle doll, then spinning and cutting down the next two. The final two tried to flank him.\nHe slid low, Scar turning into twin tonfas, and struck both side by side with brutal force. Sparks flew, and the dolls broke apart.\nPeople in the stands stood up, shouting.\n\"He's unstoppable!\"\n\"Every move looks like a dance!\"\n\"How many forms does that weapon have?!\"\nThe last doll, bigger and reinforced, activated from the back wall. It stomped forward like a mini-boss.\nAustin cracked his neck, Scar glowing with eerie darkness.\nThis time, it became a massive greatsword.\nWith a single step, Austin charged. The doll swung down with both arms—he blocked with the flat of the sword, then pushed back and cleaved it in half with one heavy strike.\nHis blade switched back to its original form, and before the doll could fall, Austin slashed the scar at an unbelievably fast pace, leaving hundreds of afterimages behind.\n\"Woah...\"\n\"That is...intense and beautiful...\"\n\"Did someone notice his hands moving?\"\nThe training doll was sliced into several dice, and they fell on the ground with light thuds.\nAustin got up and glanced at the timer. Just over sixty seconds. He still had time for another round.\nBut when he turned toward the referees, he saw them standing frozen—eyes wide, lips parted, completely speechless.\nAfter a pause, one of them stepped forward and said, \"Usually, it takes us a few days to discuss rankings and approve the title of warrior. But in your case… it would be foolish to even think twice.\"\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out a small black box.\n\"With full respect, Sir Austin Eryndor, I hereby declare you as the ninth S-rank warrior.\"\nThere was a brief silence as he held out the box. Austin accepted it with a soft smile, appreciating the honor behind the gesture.\nHe slowly removed the cover.\nInside was a golden card, gleaming, with his name engraved across it.\nHe stared at it for a moment, letting it sink in—everything he had been through, everything he had worked for—this was what it meant to stand at the top. To be called the strongest.\nHe shook hands with both officials, then walked back to the person who looked more excited than even him.\nValerie.\nWithout a word, he gently handed her the box. \"Here,\" he said, \"you deserve this as much as I do.\"\nShe took it with both hands, looked inside—and her smile bloomed. Her eyes softened and glistened slightly.\nThen she closed the box, handed it to the headmaster beside her… and threw herself into his arms.\nAustin caught her easily, wrapping his arms around her as she held on tight like she hadn't seen him in years.\n\"I'm so proud of you,\" she whispered into his chest.\nHe kissed the top of her head.\n\"Thank you for never losing trust in me… thank you, Val.\"\n...\nAfter that, a few of Austin's close friends gathered in his room to celebrate the occasion.\nSheldon, Rhea, and Averis—who had pulled a reluctant Jimmy along—sat inside, each holding a glass of fruit wine.\nSurprisingly, it was Sheldon who stood up to raise a toast.\nHe glanced around the room.\nValerie was comfortably wrapped in Austin's arms. Rhea smiled warmly at him from the side. Averis and Jimmy sat together on the couch, watching him with quiet curiosity.\nTaking a breath, Sheldon began, \"I don't know if we'll get another chance to gather like this. I don't know if peace will last beyond tomorrow. But there's one thing I do know, one thing that feels certain right now…\"\nHe paused, his lips curling into a small, honest smile.\n\"…Until the last breath of our lives, we'll remember this moment.\"\nHe lifted his glass higher.\n\"To friendships that don't fade, to bonds that can't be broken, and to the warrior who reminded us what strength truly looks like.\"\nEveryone raised their glasses in silence—then clinked them together gently.\nThe room filled with a soft warmth, the kind that only comes from knowing you're surrounded by people who matter.\nAveris suddenly turned to her brother. \"Are you going to visit home? Dad would be thrilled to hear the news.\"\nRhea smirked from her seat. \"I doubt the King hasn't already heard about it. This is Austin we're talking about.\"\nSheldon nodded, raising his glass slightly. \"True. This kind of news travels fast across the globe. It's a big deal.\"\nAustin gave a casual shrug. \"I don't know about the whole world, but... maybe I will visit in a few days.\"\nHe didn't mean it. Not entirely. But it was easier to let Averis believe that. After all, he couldn't exactly tell his younger sister the real reason he'd be heading out soon.\nHe wasn't going home.\nHe'd be crossing the Sea of Separation—heading deep into forbidden lands to hunt the Succubus Queen.\nThey continued chatting, laughing, and enjoying the simple but warm food Valerie had made. The night dragged on gently, and before long, Valerie stood and stretched.\n\"Alright, you all better head to bed,\" she said with a smile. \"We still have classes tomorrow.\"\nGrumbling but smiling, the group began to disperse, saying their goodnights.\nLater that night, long after the others had left, Austin and Valerie quietly stepped out of their room.\nThey made their way toward the northern forest, walking side by side under the silver moonlight.\nNeither spoke.\nAustin held the same wooden box he'd been given earlier that day. Valerie carried a small bunch of white flowers in her hands.\nThe wind was cold, brushing against their faces and rustling the trees—but they didn't stop.\nAnd they didn't look back.\nAfter walking for fifteen minutes, they reached a tombstone that Austin himself had created in the memory of a certain old man.\nThe first one to approach was Valerie.\nShe rested the fresh flowers there and removed the dried ones. She visits the gravestone once a week, and Austin...he probably come here daily.\nValerie did a small prayer before backing away.\nAustin then advanced towards the tombstone and started at the name he had etched for a long time.\nCountless emotions swirled in his chest as he finally knelt before him and opened the box to show his old friend what he had achieved.\n\"I wanted you to be there...to pat my back and tell me that I did great.\" His voice was heavy with emotions, \"...thank you for what you have done for me, Sebas. I hope you find peace now.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "The day finally arrived.\nWilliam had sent a letter, letting them know they'd leave for the other side in two days. He even included the coordinates for the meeting point.\nNaturally, Austin was ready—no, itching to go. He wanted to cross over and tear through some demons.\nHe told Valerie and Rhea that they'd leave tonight.\nAustin had already informed the headmaster that he was planning a short trip to the capital with Valerie, under the excuse of delivering his rank re-evaluation news.\nBut from the way the headmaster responded, Austin could tell—he knew this trip was more than just a visit to the capital. Maybe he had already pieced it together, especially after William's meeting with Austin.\nStill, Austin trusted that the headmaster wouldn't say a word, even if he figured out the truth.\nAs for Rhea, Austin wasn't sure what excuse she'd use. But he did ask her to make it sound real—just in case.\nIf the Council noticed four S-rank warriors disappearing at once, they might not take action, but they'd definitely increase surveillance.\nAnd if that happened, Austin could go from being \"the warrior\" to \"the rogue.\"\nHe hated when people poked into his personal life. He had made that clear during the last post-war meeting.\n\"Done?\" Valerie's voice came softly as she stepped into his room, slipping in as effortlessly as effortlessly she always takes his breath away.\nAustin nodded and held out his hand.\nShe passed him her bag, and he placed both hers and his into his inventory.\n\"There's still a little time left... want some coffee?\" he asked, heading toward the kitchen.\nValerie nodded. \"That'd help.\"\nAs he set the pot on the boiler, he raised an eyebrow. \"Nervous?\"\nValerie gave a light laugh. \"Who wouldn't be? We're trespassing into enemy territory. Except for you, none of us have even seen the place.\"\nAustin nodded. That made sense.\nBut then he glanced over his shoulder and said, \"I don't feel afraid—not because I've been there. But because I know we'll have each other's backs.\"\nValerie blinked, a little stunned by his words. Then her expression softened, and her shoulders relaxed.\n\"I know we will,\" she said. \"We'll protect each other no matter what.\"\n\"Uh-huh,\" Austin smirked. \"And if one of us gets into real trouble, the other won't hesitate to throw the mission away to go after them.\"\nValerie smiled faintly. She didn't say anything.\nShe didn't need to.\nAustin brought the coffee and sat across from her.\nValerie took a small sip and smiled. \"It's good.\"\nFor Austin, that smile was the perfect sweetness his coffee needed.\nThough lately... he was learning to enjoy it bitter too.\nOnce they finished, they got up and left the room.\nWhen they reached the rendezvous point, Austin frowned upon seeing someone else standing beside Rhea.\n\"You're not seriously thinking of bringing him along,\" he said bluntly.\nRhea shot him a glare. \"So rude.\"\nMorkel let out a soft laugh. \"Don't worry, Austin. I know my limits—I won't slow you down by asking to come. Even though...\" he glanced at Rhea, his voice dropping slightly, \"...I really wanted to.\"\nRhea sighed, reached out, and took his hand. \"You know—\"\n\"I know,\" Morkel said, giving her hand a gentle squeeze. \"Don't worry. I'll wait for you.\"\nThen he turned to Austin.\n\"Can I entrust her to you?\"\nAustin froze for a moment. This felt familiar—something from the game. Back then, he had been the one to ask Morkel to protect Rhea.\nStill, he nodded. \"She's a friend. I'd never abandon her.\"\nMorkel smiled and patted his shoulder. \"Thank you. I'd like to talk sometime—about many things. But for now, I wish you all the best.\"\nAustin had a pretty good idea of what that future talk would be about, but he simply nodded and stepped back. \"Let's go.\"\nRhea gave Morkel a tight hug and whispered, \"Take care of yourself.\"\n\"You too,\" he replied softly.\nNot long after, the three of them left the area and made their way west—toward the Sea of Separation.\n°°°°°°\n\"You know, I still think this is madness,\" said a short-haired woman standing by the shore, arms folded tightly over her chest.\n\"Then... are you planning to back out?\" asked Charlotte—the barrier user who had visited Austin just days ago.\nOlivia scoffed. \"Miss this chance to hit the factory instead of raiding tiny shops? Oh, please.\"\nShe had been stationed at the bunker during the war—the same one where the Councilman hid. And even now, she hadn't let go of that frustration.\nShe wanted war. Real war. The kind where she could finally let loose—no fear of hitting allies, no orders to hold back.\nShe was aching for blood.\n\"Don't let your excitement cloud your focus, Olivia,\" William said calmly as he sipped the tea Charlotte had brewed. \"The target is the General. That's what matters.\"\nOlivia gave a dry laugh. \"Everything boils down to violence anyway. Just let me keep punching and killing. That's how things get done.\"\nCharlotte let out a sigh. \"What you said isn't wrong, but I doubt the rest of the team will appreciate your... enthusiasm.\"\nOlivia scoffed. \"They're just a bunch of kids. What could they possibly say?\"\nWilliam gave a small, amused smile. \"One of those kids slaughtered hundreds of demons in seconds. You might not want to underestimate him.\"\n\"Oh, right… the Prince.\" Olivia's eyes gleamed with memory. \"I remember feeling his presence during the conference. That bloodlust was insane. Didn't expect that at all. I was this close to jumping in for a duel.\"\nThe thrill still lingered in her voice. She was genuinely excited to see him in action—and even more eager to count the demons he'd bring down.\nCharlotte gave her a tired look. \"You're making that face again…\"\n\"What face?\" Olivia blinked, confused.\nCharlotte shook her head. \"Just don't get too attached to Austin. A certain violet-haired girl might declare war on you.\"\n\"Oh, her? I like that girl. She's got a wildfire in her eyes… and a whole lot of hidden power. Heard she trained under Selner?\"\n\"True,\" William said with a nod. \"She played a key role during the war. Helped more than you'd think.\"\n\"That so? Then there are two punks I need to keep an eye on,\" Olivia said with a grin, cracking her knuckles in excitement.\nCharlotte rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath, \"With that attitude, I'm pretty sure they'll be the ones keeping an eye on you.\"\nSuddenly, William stood up sharply, his body stiffening like a drawn bowstring.\n\"Will?\" Charlotte called out, her eyes narrowing as she followed his gaze.\n\"Get behind me!\" he shouted without looking back.\nCharlotte didn't hesitate. She ducked behind him, while Olivia instantly summoned her Shard, her muscles tense and eyes sharp. She sensed it too.\nThe sound of hooves grew louder.\nWithin seconds, over fifty armored soldiers burst through the tree line on horseback, forming a semi-circle around them on the rocky shore. Dust and dry leaves whirled in the wind behind them.\nAnd that wasn't all.\nWilliam's eyes darted to the woods. He could feel the pressure—the sharp, focused intent of more soldiers hidden within the trees. At least a hundred more. Waiting. Watching.\nThen, one of the front riders dismounted. His boots crunched against the gravel as he stepped forward with calm authority. His armor was polished, his movements controlled—but the tension in his posture gave away his unease.\nHe stopped a few feet in front of them, meeting William's gaze head-on.\n\"Hero William. Warrior Charlotte. Warrior Olivia,\" he announced in a flat voice, \"We request that you put down your weapons… and come with us.\"\nHis hand didn't move toward his sword, but everyone could feel it—the moment someone twitched wrong, blades would be drawn.\nThe silence that followed was heavy, the sea breeze doing little to ease the weight in the air.\n\"What is our crime?\" William asked with a frown. He still couldn't discern how they located them so soon.\nThe soldier voiced, \"You have breached the law by having the intention to cross the SOS without permission.\"\n\"Who says we are about to cross? We are just having some fun time here.\" Olivia snarled.\nThe soldier didn't budge, \"Guess we will find out in the interrogation cell.\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes...this is bad. The interrogation department would discern everything instantly. And all the planning they have done past few weeks would be wasted.\nTension rose...William couldn't do anything but stand there.\n\"We know you won't attack us, Hero. Your principles won't allow you, so just come with us.\" The soldier confidently stated.\nWilliam gritted his teeth in frustration. Frustrated because he was right.\nThe soldier took a step forward but then—\n\"Ah!\" The soldier backed away as an ice spike rose from the ground.\n\"He won't hurt you,\"\nEveryone turned toward the source of the voice and saw three teenagers stepping toward them.\nAustin looked at the commander in the eye and told him, \"But don't assume the same with me, Commander. I hold no such principles.\"\nIt was not a threat but a warning. And every soldier could feel it.\n°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "The atmosphere was thick with tension.\nNone of the soldiers had been informed that two more S-ranks would be joining this mission—and not just any S-ranks. These two were among the most unpredictable warriors on record. Teenagers, yes—but more importantly, they had refused the Council's invitation to join them. A bold defiance that made them dangerous.\nCommander Eric knew the stakes. He wasn't delusional—he didn't believe for a second that even twice the number of men under his command would be enough to take down five S-ranks. Not even a speck of hope existed on that front.\nBut if he played his cards right… he could force William to end this madness.\nMaybe even convince him to surrender.\nHe turned to the golden-haired swordsman and said firmly, \"Warrior William, I must remind you—when you joined the Council, you signed an agreement. And according to that agreement, the Council holds the right to keep you at headquarters for as long as necessary.\"\nWilliam's brow furrowed. \"But there's no threat against the Council.\"\nEric gave a small, smug snicker. \"We will decide that, Warrior. For now, you must come with us. Refuse—and you breach the agreement.\"\nThat wasn't just a threat—it was a trap.\nBreach the agreement, and William would be marked as a rogue.\nAnd everyone knew the kind of man William was. He revered the Council. He saw them as protectors of the innocent, defenders of peace.\nRebellion was not in his nature.\nAustin knew exactly what kind of storm was churning in William's mind.\nBut then—\n\"Even if you decide to back off, William,\" Austin said nonchalantly, \"know this—I'll still go.\"\nThe words hit like a hammer.\nThe Commander's eyes widened. Even William looked startled.\nThis mission… one that posed a threat even to five S-ranks—\nAnd now, three teenagers were planning to take it on?\nIt wasn't just reckless.\nIt was foolish.\nSuicidal.\n\"You cannot cross the Sea of Separation unless you intend to break the law, Warrior Austin,\" Eric snapped, his voice gaining edge and force.\nValerie's expression darkened. Frost crept at her fingertips, and for a second, the air turned deathly cold.\nBut before she could act, Austin caught her hand.\nA silent gesture.\nI've got this.\nThen, he turned his eyes back to Eric.\n\"Look into my eyes, Commander,\" Austin said calmly, \"and tell me if you see an ounce of hesitation… or fear… for your Council.\"\nThe Commander froze.\nHe had heard whispers of what happened at the conference.\nHe had heard the rumors.\nAustin didn't follow the rules.\nAustin didn't bluff.\nAnd worse—he had the strength to back his arrogance.\nThis is bad… Eric muttered inwardly.\nThen, as a last move, he turned toward the one warrior still bound by duty,\n\"Warrior William,\" he said, his voice sharper now, \"if they cross the SOS and something happens to them… you know who'll be held responsible for it.\"\nWilliam's frown deepened.\nHe couldn't ignore the truth in Eric's words.\nHe couldn't bring himself to allow three teenagers to cross into the demonic realm alone.\nIf something happened to them...\nAll that would be left…\nWould be regret.\nCharlotte suddenly stepped forward, her voice cutting through the tension like a blade.\n\"Are you really going to let him manipulate you?\" she called out, sharp and displeased.\nWilliam flinched, his gaze snapping to his lover.\n\"Can't you see it, William? The Council just wants a leash around your neck. They're trying to stop you from doing the one thing that might actually free you—from being their strongest, most obedient hound.\"\nHer words echoed. Raw and hateful.\nShe had tolerated the Council's treatment of him for far too long—the way they commanded him like a tool, pushing him to do things he loathed, all in the name of world peace.\nBut this moment… this was the first time William had made a choice for himself since joining the Council. A decision made not for orders, not for reputation, but for the betterment of mankind.\nAnd they were trying to shackle him again.\nEric could feel the situation spiraling. His authority was slipping.\nHe raised his voice in a final attempt to control the scene.\n\"Anyone who takes a step toward the sea will be considered a traitor—banished from the human lands! If you walk away now, you will be branded a betrayer—augh!\"\nA scream tore from his throat as an ice spike flew across the field and impaled his shoulder, snapping his arm back at a sickening angle.\nHe dropped to one knee, clutching his broken limb as blood seeped between his fingers.\nEyes wide, he glared at the violet-haired girl.\nValerie stood unmoved, her hand still cold from casting.\n\"Annoying toad,\" she growled.\n\"Hey, you!\" barked a soldier, raising his bow and loosing an arrow toward her.\nBefore it could strike, another arrow cut across the air—faster.\nRhea's arrow glowed faintly, colliding midair with a pink shimmer she had fired a heartbeat before. It altered course, pierced through the shimmer, and veered like a guided blade—\n—straight into the soldier's shoulder, disarming him instantly.\nThen, Austin moved.\nHe summoned Scar—and slammed it into the ground.\nA wave of pressure exploded outward.\nThe very air trembled.\nSome soldiers staggered back. Others fell to their knees, clutching their chests as though something invisible was clawing at them, trying to rip their souls free.\nAnd at the center of it all, Austin stood still.\nEyes locked on the bleeding Commander.\nA quiet menace, more terrifying than any scream.\n\"Commander,\" he said, voice low but deadly, \"take another rash step… and I promise I'll show you what I did during the war.\"\nEric's face turned pale.\nHe knew—one more word, one more push—and that boy would end him. Right here, right now.\nThen suddenly—\n\"Fuck this, I'm in.\"\nOlivia's voice rang out as she stepped forward, walking over to Austin. She gave his shoulder a light pat and smirked.\n\"You got guts, kid. And thanks to you, now I finally remember what I need to fight for.\"\nShe turned to William, locking eyes with him.\nHer gaze said everything.\nNo words were needed.\nWilliam felt a hand squeeze him—it was Charlotte.\nShe wore a serious expression, but the way she nodded at him... it was all the reassurance he needed.\nHe nodded back.\nTurning to Eric, he said clearly, \"Go back and tell the Council this—I'm crossing the sea on my own will. Brand me however you want, but I know what I'm doing is right. For all of us.\"\nEric's jaw tightened.\nThe one warrior he could count on—his biggest advantage—was now turning away, just like the rest. His last card discarded itself.\nHe raised his hand. At once, the soldiers began backing away, moving with practiced discipline. Horses mounted, commands silent, as if they had only been waiting for this signal.\nEric didn't speak again.\nHe gave Austin one cold side glance before turning his back.\nI'll remember this humiliation, he swore to himself.\nOne by one, the soldiers vanished from the clearing. Even those hidden in the forest melted away like ghosts.\nSilence returned.\nWilliam exhaled, finally letting out the breath he didn't realize he'd been holding.\n\"Thank you,\" he murmured to Charlotte.\nShe pulled him into a hug. \"You did well.\"\nIt felt strange—being praised for breaking a law. But William smiled and accepted it with open arms.\nMeanwhile—\n\"Hey, girlie,\" Olivia called out casually to the violet-haired warrior.\nValerie didn't even glance her way.\nRhea, ever the buffer, gave Olivia a small wave to defuse the awkwardness.\nOlivia just shrugged. She knew why Valerie still held a grudge—and honestly, she didn't blame her.\nThen Austin approached the couple, still locked in their embrace.\n\"Are we leaving now,\" he asked dryly, \"or are you guys planning on flirting until Council sends more?\"\nThe pair jolted apart like they'd been burned.\nWilliam turned crimson, looking away in embarrassment.\nCharlotte scowled at Austin. \"I shouldn't be hearing that from you.\"\nAustin only shrugged, cool as ever.\n\"Well, we're short on time. I'm betting the Council's already reinforcing the sea with another line of defense.\"\nHer glare faded.\nEveryone knew he was right.\nWilliam turned to the water body, his gaze sharpened, \"You are right. We would be weak in the water so we need to change our route and avoid any confrontation.\"\n\"Oh, I can be your guide.\" Austin volunteered before turning toward Charlotte, \"You can hold a shield for an hour right?\"\nCharlotte nodded, \"If it's just meant for floating then yes.\"\nAustin nodded as he started approaching the water, taking off his shirt as he said, \"I will go and scout first. Once I confirm which location—\"\n\"Ah!\" Suddenly, Austin was hugged.\nHe blinked in confusion before looking down at his girlfriend who was covering his bare upper half.\n\"M-My Lord...you should be a little more careful...\" She mumbled before Austin glanced around and found Rhea looked away with a slightly red face and Olivia openly devoured the sight before her.\nAustin heaved a sigh and decided to get into the water with clothes.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"Hmm?\"\nA soldier turned his head slowly, sensing a ripple in the water.\nSomething had disturbed the surface, but he saw nothing—no movement beneath the boat, no shapes cutting through the depths.\n\"What's wrong?\" asked another soldier, walking along the floating bridge that connected two of the patrol boats.\nThe bridge was made of large, sealed gallons tied tightly together, forming a makeshift path that bobbed with the water's gentle rise and fall.\nAround them, multiple boats drifted in slow patrol patterns. Over a dozen were anchored, spread out evenly at strategic intervals across the water.\nThe soldier who had sensed the disturbance squinted at the water once more before shaking his head. \"Nothing,\" he muttered.\nThe other soldier nodded and kept walking, his boots thudding softly on the barrels.\nMeanwhile, beneath the water's surface, Austin clicked his tongue and retreated silently.\nWith the help of his Aqua Lungs, he was able to breathe underwater and scan the area for the best route across.\nHe could have easily wiped out the guards and carved a direct path through…\n…but they were just doing their jobs.\nSo instead, he swam for a few more minutes, keeping low and silent, until he finally spotted a stretch to the west where no guards were stationed.\nHe swam to shore.\nThe chill of the dark lands crept over him as he emerged, and a sense of foreboding settled in his chest. Without wasting time, he drew out his plasma launcher.\nRaising it above his head, he fired a beacon into the sky.\nThen he sat down on the cold, damp shore—tense, alert. There was a good chance the soldiers would spot the signal, or worse, that the demons in the area would attack.\nBut this was still the fastest and cleanest route—no direct confrontation required.\nHe waited.\nAnd waited.\nUntil finally, shapes appeared in the distance. A few figures moved through the gloom, protected by a magical shield that kept the water from touching them. Someone at the back pushed it forward with steady control.\nSuddenly, Valerie leapt from a distance.\nAustin stood to catch her easily in his arms.\n\"How was the ride?\" he whispered, gently combing his fingers through her hair.\n\"Boring without you,\" she pouted, leaning into his touch.\nAustin chuckled. \"Well, we can take a boat ride after we return. Just you and me, floating in the middle of the ocean—me holding you in my arms. Sounds appealing, doesn't it?\"\nValerie smiled softly. \"Yes… that sounds romantic.\"\nA mocking voice chimed in from nearby.\n\"Someone was teasing me about flirting just a few minutes ago.\"\nIt was Charlotte, the one managing the barrier.\nAustin glanced at her and grinned. \"Having a beautiful wife leaves a man helpless sometimes.\"\nValerie blushed at his words, the warmth creeping up her cheeks. Rhea just shook her head with a smile. Seriously, Austin had no sense of shame when it came to his girl.\n\"Are we starting the rampage now?\" Olivia asked, or rather, demanded.\nAustin sighed. \"We're not charging in without a plan. So don't go rushing at the first demon you see, or we will abandon you.\"\nOlivia snickered. \"I'll be hefty by myself.\"\nWilliam, fully dressed now, gave her a pointed look. \"No, you won't, Olivia. You know well enough that you can't take them all alone. And I know you value your life just as much as the rest of us.\"\nOlivia didn't answer. She just looked away, lips pressed tight.\nWilliam then turned to Austin. \"So, how do we enter?\"\n\"We can't risk going straight from here,\" Austin said, glancing back toward the shore. \"They've probably seen the beacon by now. So we take another route—circle around and scout the area first. I'll search for a checkpost we can use as our entry point.\"\nEveryone fell quiet, the mood sharpening as the mission's weight returned.\nWilliam nodded, and they all began to move.\nThe shoreline of the demonic land was barren—cracked, dry, and uneven. Each step had to be taken with care, as one wrong move could cause the brittle rock to give way, dropping them into the cold waters below.\nValerie's breath had grown shallow. Her body was unnaturally tense, even though no demons were in sight. She could feel it—an oppressive weight that clung to the air itself.\nIt was this realm.\n\"It's cold… and heavy here,\" Rhea murmured, giving voice to what everyone else was feeling.\n\"The sun never rises in this place,\" Austin said calmly, leading the group forward. \"You'll rarely see anything green. And if you do come across plants… keep your distance. Most of them bite back.\"\nThey walked in silence, letting Austin's words guide them. Every few steps, he shared another piece of advice—how to avoid the black mist, what signs to watch for, and which stones not to step on.\nAfter a while, Olivia spoke up, her curiosity getting the better of her.\n\"How do you know so much about this side?\"\nShe knew he'd been here once—back when his father-in-law had been kidnapped. But that was just one trip. One visit shouldn't have given him this much insight.\nShe glanced at him, her expression skeptical.\nAustin shrugged, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. \"My source of information is someone you already know.\"\nOlivia raised a brow, thinking for a moment—then her eyes lit up. \"Oh… Selner?\"\nAustin didn't answer.\nBut the silence was enough.\nOlivia frowned in confusion. \"I don't get it. Why is that woman so considerate toward you? She treated me like crap when I trained under her. Hardly acknowledged me, and I know she's the same with others.\"\nAustin chuckled under his breath but still didn't respond.\nValerie's brows furrowed slightly at Olivia's words, a flicker of emotion crossing her face. But then she remembered what Austin had told her about Selner—about their history—and slowly exhaled. There was no reason to feel uneasy.\nNo one else spoke. The group continued forward, walking in silence for another hour through the harsh, uneven terrain. The oppressive air of the demonic realm grew thicker with every step.\nFinally, William broke the silence. \"I think we're far enough.\"\nAustin scanned the area and nodded. \"Charlotte, come with me.\"\nCharlotte gave a short nod and stepped up beside him as he moved toward an incline. She had the barrier skill, and that made her ideal for this part of the mission—scouting ahead and defending if necessary.\nHe gave an assuring look to Valerie who seemed concerned.\nSoon, Austin and Charlotte disappeared up the ridge, the others waiting below, ready to move the moment the path was clear.\nThey took a few cautious steps before coming to a pause.\n\"What...the hell is this?\" Charlotte asked with a frown seeing the dense fog ahead\nAustin voiced, \"A perimeter.\"\nCharlotte wordlessly moved her hand and summoned her Shard. Using the ability she summoned a barrier around them.\n\"Let's go,\" Austin said, stepping forward through the fog—with Charlotte right behind him.\nBut after just a few steps, they both froze.\n\"Agh!\" Charlotte cried out, wincing in pain the moment she crossed the boundary.\nAustin's frown deepened as he felt a burning sensation prickling across his skin.\nWithout hesitation, Charlotte raised her barrier above their heads.\nHer neck and shoulder were already marked red, and she glanced at Austin with disbelief. \"This… is insane.\"\nAustin gave a slow nod. \"No wonder the soldiers never made it out. They must have started burning the second they entered this zone.\"\nThough he hadn't taken any serious damage, he could feel the heat—just enough to imagine what weaker soldiers must've gone through.\nThen Charlotte's eyes widened in alarm. \"Oh no…\"\nThe acid rain wasn't just burning through her shield—it was eating away at her very Soul.\nThe barrier began to sizzle and crack as drops pierced through it.\n\"Take it down!\" Austin ordered sharply as he summoned Scar and morphed it into a wide shield.\nCharlotte immediately retracted her Shard.\nLetting a Shard absorb damage came at a terrible cost—it shortened the user's lifespan. And right now, the rain was melting her barrier like wax in a fire.\n\"What about you? It isn't harming your Shard?\" Charlotte asked in concern seeing him using his Shard transformed into a shield.\nAustin wryly chuckled, \"Shard is consuming the dark water. Don't worry.\"\nIf Scar wouldn't have been able to consume Dark Water, it could have never consumed the demons like its favorite snack.\nThey walked into the lands and looked around.\nCharlotte noticed there was no building or demon in the sighting.\nAustin narrowed his eyes as he mumbled under his breath, \"We are close to a kingdom.\"\n\"Hmm? How do you know?\"\nAustin pointed towards a small mountain, \"There is surveillance there. And only a demonic kingdom is protected with hidden soldiers.\"\nCharlotte instinctively backed away, hiding behind Austin, not wanting to get seen by the demons.\nAustin looked around a few more seconds before telling her, \"I think I have found where we can make our shelter. Let's go back.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- The beginning of the arc might seem boring but please stick around.",

      "content": "Austin recognized the area well. The entire shoreline had once been his territory—his hunting ground, his hiding place. He knew every rock and slope, every sound the tide made when danger crept near.\nThis was close to the demonic region ruled by the Succubus Queen, so he wasted no time. The surveillance demons were the first to go. He took the shelter for himself before any alarm could be raised.\n\"Is it safe to be here?\" Rhea asked as she stepped into the bunker-like room. The air was thick, stale, and heavy with the stench of decay.\nCharlotte covered her nose while William summoned his Shard, lighting up the place with a cold golden glow.\n\"Demons don't check in like humans do,\" Austin said, spraying perfume from his Inventory around the shelter. \"The ones stationed out here live like hermits. They only report if something odd happens.\"\n\"Agh, there's a rotting boar in here,\" Charlotte muttered, turning her head away in disgust.\nValerie summoned her Shard and tapped the ground. Ice spread quickly, trapping the bodies in a frozen cage. She gave Olivia a look.\nWithout a word, Olivia stepped forward and lifted the cage with ease.\nCharlotte sighed in relief as the source of the smell was taken outside.\nWilliam began searching the shelter. His eyes caught sight of several old weapons and gallons of dark water. Rhea, meanwhile, was checking for traps, but just like Austin had said—most demons stationed far from the palace were idiots. Brutes with clubs, not brains.\nThe bunker could fit twenty people, maybe more. The roof was conical, the floor layered with dry leaves, and the windows sealed with bricks.\nAustin pulled a lantern from his Inventory—a gem flickered at its center—and placed it on the ground. Everyone gathered as he unrolled a hand-drawn map.\n\"Woah…\" Olivia muttered. She hadn't expected something this detailed.\nAustin pointed from the northwest edge toward the center. \"We're here. If I'm right, we're only thirty minutes away from the Succubus Queen's palace.\"\nWilliam's brows furrowed. \"That close? Are you sure this place is safe?\"\nAustin chuckled. \"If she finds out we're here, she'll run. Trust me—fighting us wouldn't even cross her mind in her current state.\"\nWilliam nodded slowly. \"Still, we can't let her escape.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Austin said, eyes narrowing. \"I'll scout the palace in an hour. If everything looks clear, we strike tonight.\"\nOlivia's grin widened. \"Now you're talking.\" She could already feel her fists itching to smash through the palace doors.\nValerie stepped forward, concern flickering in her eyes. \"You're going alone? There'll be thousands of them. If they sense you…\"\nBut Austin didn't get the chance to respond.\n\"I'll go,\" Charlotte said softly. Her voice trembled, but she didn't back down. \"I wasn't any help back there. My barrier melted under the rain... I was supposed to protect everyone, and I failed.\"\nHer shoulders sank.\nWilliam reached out and took her hand. \"One moment doesn't define you,\" he said gently. \"You're stronger than that. You'll prove it.\"\nCharlotte looked down, trying to believe it.\nAustin gave her a glance. Silent, but acknowledging.\nAfter a short silence, the blond prince spoke.\n\"I can't cover anyone but myself with Scar—not unless I want to attract attention. So, it's better if I go alone.\"\nHis tone left no room for debate.\nValerie sighed, clearly wanting to argue, but held her tongue.\nThen Rhea spoke up, her voice curious. \"I've been wondering... where does the magician live? The one who controls the weather?\"\nAll eyes turned to Austin as if he were the walking encyclopedia of the demonic world.\nAustin shrugged. \"Selner never really looked for that creature. We were focused on rescuing the Duke.\"\nThe truth was, the old Austin had never cared to study the terrain or turn the environment in his favor. He'd been arrogant—too strong to worry about such things. All he cared about was crushing whatever stood in his way.\nRhea simply hummed in response, falling silent.\nAustin shifted the conversation back. \"Anyway, you all need to rest and recover. I brought supplies.\"\nWith that, he started pulling items from his Inventory—more lanterns, water pouches, wrapped sandwiches, energy bars, and a range of other necessities.\nOlivia stared in disbelief. \"Where are you pulling all that from…?\"\nAustin smirked. \"One of the abilities of my Shard.\"\nThey didn't question further even though it was surreal for a Shard to have multiple skills.\n...\nAustin stood by one of the narrow windows, his eyes scanning the dark horizon with a deep frown.\nIt was too quiet. The stillness in the air didn't feel like peace—it felt like a warning. As if they were walking straight into a carefully laid trap.\nBut what could the Queen really do? Even if she had predicted this attack, what could she summon to stop them?\nThe ancient beings wouldn't obey her—she wasn't strong enough to command them. The Elven King only awakened with the Demon Lord, and that wasn't supposed to happen yet.\nSo... was her grand defense really just an army of thousands?\n\"Are you okay?\" A gentle voice broke his train of thought—followed by warmth wrapping around his hands.\nAustin sighed, letting his gaze drop. \"Sometimes I think I overanalyze everything.\"\nValerie leaned her head against his shoulder, her voice soft but steady. \"Being cautious isn't wrong. Just don't let your thoughts become chains when it's time to act.\"\nHe let out a slow breath, the weight on his chest not quite lifting. \"That's what worries me. No matter how much I plan… there's still a chance we might fail.\"\nHe couldn't just rely on the timeline from his previous life. That path was already breaking apart. The Elven King could still awaken early. Anything was possible now.\nValerie squeezed his hand gently. \"You're leading this team. It's natural for doubts to creep in. I've led raids before—I know how it eats at you. But trust your judgment, Austin. So far, you've never let us down.\"\nHer words didn't erase his fear, but they gave it less room to grow.\nAustin softly relayed, \"Thank you...I needed that.\"\n....\nNot so long after, Austin summoned Scar and while using it as a head and shoulder guard, he ran toward the fort where the Queen lives.\nThe acid rain wasn't fierce but yes, being exposed to it for an hour might seriously damage even a S-rank.\nAustin moved quickly, ducking behind broken stone pillars, twisted trees, and large chunks of blackened rock. The ground was dry in some places and soaked with sticky, dark water in others. Patches of glowing moss clung to the sides of old ruins, casting a faint purple light.\nHe passed a crumbled statue of what once looked like a knight—now melted, its face warped by time and rain.\nThe terrain became harsher the closer he got. Sharp roots rose from the earth like claws, and scattered bones crunched underfoot. The path ahead narrowed between two collapsed towers, creating a natural funnel.\nHe slowed for a moment, crouching behind a large, split boulder. Ahead, he spotted three surveillance posts—tall poles with demon eyes mounted on top, blinking slowly.\nDemons patrolled nearby, walking lazily as if nothing important was happening. Their skin was thick and dark, and they didn't seem to care about the rain at all.\n'They don't rotate shifts often... Good.'\nAustin took note of their pattern—how long they stayed in place, how far they walked, and when they turned.\nFar beyond, hidden behind layers of smoke and fog, the Queen's palace began to take shape—a jagged silhouette, resting like a beast curled in sleep.\nHowever, Austin's eyes soon widened as he noticed something inside the fort gates—hundreds of humans being pushed into the castle, their skin burning but they were barely reacting. Their body was naked, and rope was tied around their wrists.\nFollowing that Austin noticed a huge magic circle building at the crown of the fort.\nIt was glowing very faintly that's why he didn't notice until now. But seeing those many human slaves he guessed what she was about to do.\n'She is awakening the Elven King...shit!'\nHe didn't expect the Succubus Queen to be creating a Vessel so soon.\nAnd if she does, she would create a strong ally; she would be able to command ancient beings and that would keep them away from her longer.\n'Why the fuck Council never noticed so many humans being taken away?!' His frustration rose as he rushed back to the base.\n\"Austin?!\" Valerie exclaimed, seeing him breathing roughly.\nAustin informed, \"She is awakening the strongest General. We must attack now-\"he paused as he noticed one person missing. With a frown, he asked, \"Where is Rhea?\"\nCharlotte responded, \"She walked out three hours ago...haven't returned. William went to search for her but she was nowhere to be found.\"\nAustin gritted his teeth, 'Where the hell did she go?'\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Ah...this is the second last arc. After this, the final battle and we say goodbye.",

      "content": "Everyone had a tense expression as they waited inside the bunker for Austin to return.\nHe has gone out to search for Rhea since the clock was ticking and they didn't have much time left.\nIt would take only half a day for the ritual to take place, and then they would need to face the strongest General too, someone strong enough to even challenge the current Austin.\n\"She is an idiot!\" Olivia cursed in frustration. She couldn't believe that they brought along such an irresponsible girl to the raid who wandered away on her own and now the whole operation was at risk.\nValerie frowned, not displeased by her cursing. Inwardly, she was intensely angry too; not only was she delaying the mission, she even forced Austin to take a risk and search for her.\n\"Was she taken captive?\" Charlotte wondered aloud, her face contoured with concern.\n\"Most likely,\" William agreed, \"she might have gone too close to the fort and could have triggered a trap. Otherwise, I couldn't think of any other reasons why she hadn't returned by now.\"\nAustin wouldn't have brought along her if Rhea was actually that kind of person to sate her curiosity and risk the whole operation. Then, naturally, she must have gotten entangled in a situation from which she couldn't escape.\n\"What we should do now?\" Charlotte asked, glancing between Valerie and William.\nValerie remained silent and just when William was about to say that he was going for a lookout, someone barged in.\nValerie instantly approached him, checking his condition first.\n\"Did you find her?\" Asked Charlotte.\n\"No,\" Austin exhaled an exasperated sigh, \"...she left no trail and I hardly believe she would have escaped back to the mainland. That means she has gotten trapped by the demons.\"\nThe atmosphere grew tense at those words. Their last hope of reuniting with Rhea was now also lost.\nA brief moment of silence was followed by Olivia's query, \"What do we do now?\" It wasn't like she wasn't concerned for Rhea. Even though she didn't know her, Rhea was a young girl who came here with the intention to take vengeance for those whom she lost.\nHowever, Olivia prioritized the mission since they might not get another chance to ambush the demonic general.\nAnd Austin's following words aligned with her desire, \"We will ambush the fort. Now.\"\n\"Wait—what about the girl?\" Charlotte asked, sounding concerned even though she barely knew her.\nAustin ran his fingers through his hair, clearly frustrated, as he said, \"Considering she is trapped there we must not delay. And if we don't find Rhea there we will search for her once we stop the ritual and slaughter the Succubus Queen.\"\nHe was concerned for Rhea, true. But he can't risk letting the Elven King awaken, or this would turn messy. And unless Rhea was actually captured by the demons, she would take care of herself, Austin knew.\nEveryone exchanged glances before William spoke, \"That's right, we shouldn't lose focus on our goal.\" Resting his hand on Austin's shoulder, he asked, \"Take the command and lead us.\"\nAustin gave a brief nod.\n....\nThe group of five had left the shelter not long ago.\nTwo pairs moved out, and Olivia went alone.\nAustin had already given them their roles.\nThe rain stung like needles, but as S-ranks, they could handle the pain.\nAustin wanted to shield Valerie with Scar—but using someone else's Shard was impossible. A basic rule.\n\"I'm okay,\" Valerie said, crouched behind a rock.\nAustin stared at her for a second… then nodded.\nThey were close—just a few meters from the fort's entrance.\nAustin looked at Olivia. She nodded and stepped out.\nGrrr\nA demonic hound saw her. It growled low, eyes glowing with caution.\nMore demons turned, weapons ready.\nThe hound charged.\nBut Olivia grinned. Silver light flashed around her fists—her Shard, the twin gauntlets appeared.\nShe moved. Fast. So fast she blurred.\nThe hound leapt—\nOlivia leapt higher.\nShe locked her fingers, raised her arms, and brought them down with a roar.\n\"HAA!\"\nCRACK\nThe hound's skull burst.\nBOOOOOM\nThey slammed into the earth. The ground split apart—cracks spreading like lightning. Everything shook.\nThe explosion echoed through the air, loud enough to alert the entire fort.\nDemons turned.\nThe real fight had begun.\nDozens of demons stormed out, teeth bared, their bodies oozing pure bloodlust.\nOlivia grinned wide.\n\"COME AT ME!\"\nJust as the first wave neared—\nFWOOOSH\nA blinding light crashed down, swallowing them whole.\nOlivia clicked her tongue and looked up.\nA man, glowing like a second sun, descended with his sword raised.\nBOOM\nAshes rained down. The entire first wave—gone.\nWilliam landed beside her and slashed diagonally.\nAn orc lunged—only to be split in half before it even roared.\n\"I had that,\" Olivia muttered.\nShe turned back to see a swarm—hundreds of them—rushing at full speed.\nWilliam smirked.\n\"Let's do this like old times.\"\nOlivia slammed her fists together.\n\"LET'S GO!\"\nBoth tore into opposite flanks.\nWilliam shot into the air and hurled his sword like a spear.\nWHOOSH—THUNK!\nIt pierced straight through a chimera's skull.\nHe landed hard, ducked under a punch, and drove his fingers into a Minotaur's gut.\n\"URGH!\"\nThe beast's insides burst as William ripped them out.\nWithout pause, he crouched low, Soul Energy crackling across his body.\nBOOM!\nHe blasted forward, smashing through another giant.\nTwo elves tried to intercept him—too slow.\nWilliam grabbed their faces mid-charge—\nCRACK!\nHe slammed their skulls into the ground, ending them in one brutal motion.\nBut the monsters kept coming.\nWilliam summoned his blade back into his hand—\nAnd the massacre continued.\nOn the other side, Olivia cracked her neck and surged forward like a bullet.\nA lizardman swung its axe—she ducked and snapped its knee backward with one low punch.\nBefore it screamed, she twisted mid-spin and slammed her elbow into its temple.\nCRACK! The skull dented inward.\nBehind her, three demons leaped—\nShe raised her palm.\nBOOM!\nA sudden gravity push blasted from her hand, slamming it into a wall hard enough to splatter bone and blood.\n\"Next,\" she muttered.\nA troll charged, twice her size, roaring.\nShe leaped—and in the air, yanked herself toward its head using a focused gravity pull.\nWHAM!\nBoth her fists crashed into the top of its skull like hammers.\nIts legs buckled.\nBefore it could fall, she flipped and punched downward again—this time with a full body slam assisted by a gravity push.\nBOOOOOOM!\nThe troll's head exploded into the ground like a dropped boulder.\nBlood mist rose.\nA newt tried to flank her—silent, fast.\nShe felt it.\nTurned sharply and pulled it mid-air with a flick of her finger.\nThe creature screamed, suspended for half a second—\nEnough.\nShe launched forward and punched through its chest with one hand.\n\"Don't sneak,\" she hissed.\nHer gauntlet glowed as she spun once and sent the corpse flying into two more behind it—like a wrecking ball of flesh.\nThey hit the wall so hard that the stone cracked.\nBreathing heavily, Olivia stood tall, her gauntlets dripping.\nAround her, bodies piled.\nMore demons hesitated.\nShe smiled, savage and wide.\n\"Who's next?\"\n...\nMeanwhile, amidst the chaos outside, Valerie and Austin moved in silence through the shadows.\nEvery now and then, a demon crossed their path—\nValerie froze them mid-step.\nAustin tore through them without a sound.\nTheir mission was clear: stop the ritual, kill the Succubus Queen if possible, and strike a heavy blow to the demonic army before regrouping.\nThis wasn't just about the Demon General—it was about carving a gap wide enough to prepare for the final war.\nThey slipped into the fortress.\nDozens of guards lined the inner walls.\nNo words were exchanged—just action.\nThe demons charged.\nValerie darted left. With one sweep of her spear, ice shards exploded out like a storm.\nSHHHK!\nThree demons were skewered mid-run, their bodies freezing over even before they hit the ground.\nAustin raised his plasma gun.\nPHWIP! PHWIP!\nUGHOH!\nGHOUH!\nClean shots—straight through their chests. Each one collapsed with their heart punctured, smoke rising from the scorched wound.\nIn seconds, the hallway was silent again.\nNo time to waste.\nThey kept moving—eyes locked ahead, footsteps quick and precise—closing in on the throne room.\nThe heart of the fortress awaited.\nAnd something dark pulsed behind that door.\nAustin and Valerie paused for a moment, shared a glance, and then nodded.\n*KREEAAAK*\nThe rusty door echoed as Austin pushed them open.\nThe inside was dark that's why they had to take a few small steps before Austin took out a lantern from the inventory.\n\"There is no one...\" Valerie muttered as she looked around—just then she noticed that her Lord had paused.\nHis expression worried her. His eyes were slightly stretched and his face became visibly pale.\n\"There...they are.\" He pointed towards the throne at the head of the court.\nValerie followed his line of sight and her breath was caught in her throat too.\nLeaning against the throne was the familiar woman against whom she fought.\nKneeling beside the throne was a dark-haired elf who extruded a presence that made it impossible to breathe normally.\nBut neither of them was the reason why Austin looked terrified.\nIt was the being sitting on the throne; all recovered and grinning.\nAstaroth.\n\"It's been a while, Hero.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Someone's about to die.

      "content": "A few days ago, Selner had come to this side and confirmed what many feared—Astaroth was still months away from full recovery. And she wasn't wrong. Austin could tell. The Demon Lord didn't carry the same terrifying weight his memory held.\nStill, one thing was clear—he had awakened. His body, though not at its peak, was whole.\nAnd he wasn't alone.\nThe Elven King, Zephyrr, had risen too. Together, they now stood as an unbreakable wall between Austin and the Succubus Queen.\nAstaroth grinned, voice curling with amusement, \"Your face tells me you regret walking into my trap. That's not like you, Hero.\"\nJust his presence in the throne room had shifted the air. His body might be weaker, but his power still rivaled Zephyrr's.\nAustin smirked back, though a bead of sweat ran down his temple. \"Didn't think the great Dark Lord would stoop to tricks to catch me.\"\nHe then glanced at the woman clinging to Astaroth, eyes narrowing. \"So desperate to protect your Queen you dragged your half-dead body out of a coffin.\"\n\"Pfhahaha!\" Astaroth's laugh boomed across the hall. \"Says the man who still hasn't gathered all his soul fragments.\"\nAustin's heart skipped a beat. So he knew. The Demon Lord was already one step ahead.\nNothing escapes him, huh? Austin's mind raced. Fighting them both was suicide. But retreat? That would doom the continent. If these two unleashed their armies, the world would burn. And if they crossed the realm's borders? It would mean war—another war no one was ready for.\n\"Well, Luke?\" The Queen's voice was honeyed with malice. \"Already planning your escape?\"\nValerie stepped forward, eyes locked on the Queen. \"Strange. Last I remember, you were the one crawling like a roach… calling out for your master to save you.\"\nThe Queen's smirk faltered. Her face tightened. Valerie's words had struck deep.\nBut that was exactly what she wanted.\nThen, the Queen turned to Astaroth, her voice low and dangerous. \"Darling… I want that human.\"\nAstaroth's eyes lit up. \"Don't kill her. I'd like to see what she's like in bed.\"\nThat was it.\nAustin's eyes turned cold. In a blink, Scar—the blade born from his hatred—was in his hand.\nZephyrr moved, golden eyes sharp. Slowly, he stood up.\n\"That sword…\" Astaroth sighed. \"Such a waste in the hands of a weakling.\"\nHe turned to his strongest general. \"Go. Cut off his hand.\"\nZephyrr bowed slightly, and then his eyes locked onto Austin.\nA heartbeat passed.\nThen he vanished in a golden flash.\nAustin barely caught the movement—just enough to raise his arm in defense. But the kick landed like thunder.\nHis body flew across the hall, crashing into the stone wall with a thud that shook the chamber.\nBlood trickled from his lip as he slumped to the ground.\nA grin tugged at his lips. \"At last…\"\nZephyrr's golden eyes narrowed. \"You've grown weaker.\"\nAustin looked up, meeting his gaze. \"Yes, I'm weak now… but wouldn't it be humiliating if my weaker self still beat you?\"\nZephyrr's face didn't even twitch. \"We won't be finding out.\"\nIn the next blink, his figure blurred again.\nAustin jumped to the side just in time to dodge the punch—but pain exploded in his ribs as the follow-up kick slammed into him.\nHe flew back a few steps, barely catching his balance.\nZephyrr was already on him.\nA sharp elbow came for his face—Austin ducked, twisted, and slashed upward with Scar. A clean arc.\nZephyr leaned back just enough to dodge the blade. His hand shot forward, gripping Austin's wrist mid-swing.\nThen came a brutal knee to the gut.\n\"Guh—!\" Austin choked, and the air knocked from his lungs. He staggered.\nZephyr didn't stop. A flurry of punches came next—one grazed his cheek, the second slammed into his shoulder, the third he blocked—but his arm screamed from the force.\nHe swung Scar blindly.\nA shallow cut opened across Zephyrr's chest.\nThe elf didn't flinch. \"Sloppy.\"\nHe kicked again—Austin blocked it this time—but just barely. The impact numbed his arm.\nHe jumped back, breathing hard. His legs felt heavy. His vision blurred for a second.\nZephyrr walked forward, slow and steady, eyes locked on him.\nAustin grits his teeth. He dashed in, low and fast, aiming for the legs.\nZephyrr twisted, grabbing his arm mid-charge, and flipped him over his shoulder.\nAustin hit the floor hard.\nDammit… too fast. Too strong.\nBut he rolled back to his feet, Scar raised.\nZephyrr charged again, calm and precise. A punch aimed for his chest—Austin turned his body, just avoiding it—but the spinning back fist that followed cracked into his jaw.\nHe tasted blood.\nStill, he didn't fall.\nHe struck again—Scar flashing toward Zephyrr's side. This time, Zephyrr blocked it with his forearm—and countered with a palm strike that sent Austin crashing into the wall once more.\nCracks spread through the stone.\nAustin coughed, wiping blood from his mouth.\n\"Accepting defeat already?\" Zephyr taunted.\n\"You should be...concerned about yourself...\" Austin said with a grin looking at the wound on his chest that still was bleeding.\n\"Another shell would erase the wound.\" Zephyr nonchalantly muttered as he stepped closer.\nAustin cracked his knuckles as he stood straight.\nHis blade transformed into gauntlets, and his aura suddenly shifted.\n[Berserk is in use!]\n[All stats have been boosted by ten times for ten minutes.]\nAustin grinned. It was nice playing around with the guy, but now it's time to defeat him.\nOn the other side of the hall, Valerie stood her ground, her chest rising and falling with steady breaths as she faced the Succubus Queen.\nShe had cast several spells already, but the Queen's whip tore through them like paper—burning through the air with deadly grace.\n\"You're struggling for nothing, girl,\" the Queen said with a lazy smile. \"Why resist? Come to our side. My Lord will grant you a purpose worth living for.\"\nValerie's gaze turned icy. \"A purpose? You mean becoming his personal plaything, leashed like a dog and moaning on command?\"\nThe Queen's eyes narrowed, but Valerie wasn't done.\n\"I've seen livestock with more dignity than you. At least they don't beg to be mounted for scraps of affection.\"\nThe Succubus Queen chuckled low, though her voice trembled with anger. \"You do have a sharp tongue…\"\nThe Queen lunged forward her whip pulled behind her head and ready to slice through Valerie.\nThe violette tapped her spear on the ground—a huge pillar erected before her\nHowever, like a hot knife through butter, the Demoness sliced through the pillar using her whip and appeared and swung her weapon again to capture Valerie—only to find Austin standing there.\n\"FU-\" **BOOOOOM**\nShe didn't get time to react before a punch connected her face, and she was sent hurling across the palace; breaking through the wall, she was sent to the inner side of the fort.\nZephyr growled as he shook his head and redirected his gaze at the blond.\nAustin was able to buy himself some time with the last attack to assist Valerie.\nThe two of them regrouped as Austin asked, \"You good?\"\nValerie nodded, \"Yes.\"\nSuccubus Queen soon returned, her mouth bleeding and anger boiling in her eyes. Zephyr also jumped to face the duo with his hand now gripping his Shard—a crossbow.\nSoon, the ground trembled, and suddenly, the roof of the fort was blasted away, and a certain blond was thrown inside.\n\"WILLIAM!\" Austin caught the man in time who looked all beaten up with a deep wound on his chest.\n\"I am okay...just couldn't heal properly...\" He muttered as he stood back on his feet.\nFrom the hole in the ceiling jumped a huge monster with feral features.\nAustin recognized him instantly.\nThe most ancient dragon and command of his legion—Hetroth.\n\"So you have gathered all your pawns today, huh?\" Austin growled as they faced the three probably the strongest warriors under Astaroth.\n\"Well, you are the only being I need to worry about. Once you are out of the game, nothing can stop me from claiming this world.\" Astaroth shrugged, crossing his arms on his chest.\nAustin gritted his teeth; this was bad.\nHe had eight minutes left before Berserk's effect would wear off. William was looking pretty bad because his source of power was the sun, so he was in a very disadvantageous position at the moment.\nWhile Sucubuss Queen was injured by that punch, being a demon she would recover soon. Zephyr hadn't received any damage at all and the Dragon King was raring to go.\nHe couldn't hope for Olivia's assistance since she must be still engaged in the battle outside and Charlotte was pretty much useless given she must be defending herself against the rain.\n\"Accept your defeat, Hero, and only your head will be taken.\" Astaroth gave the offer.\nHowever, before Austin could have responded he felt the guy beside him glowing.\nEvery eye turned towards William as suddenly his body gave a vibrant golden glow.\nWilliam's wound started to patch up, and he suddenly found his energy replenished.\nAustin's eyes widened as he suddenly shot his head into the sky...and just as he expected, despite how unbelievable it seemed, a glowing sun had appeared in the sky.\nAnd from the same hole jumped a familiar pinkhead who had gone missing before.\n\"I hope I ain't late.\" Said a grinning Rhea who now stood face to face with Austin.\nAustin now realized her motive for wandering away.\n\"Nope. Welcome back.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Ever since Austin had first learned about the mysterious mage responsible for controlling the weather in the demonic world, the thought hadn't left his mind. And for the pink-haired girl, it had become something more—an obsession.\nWho was this powerful spellcaster who kept the sun from shining over the demonic realm? Where could such a mage be hiding?\nNeither Austin nor Selner had paid much attention to the matter, treating the mage's existence as nothing more than background noise. But Rhea thought differently. She believed that killing this mage could shift the tide in their favor.\nThat's why, when Austin laid out the map of the Succubus Queen's fortress, Rhea's eyes didn't focus on the fort—but instead wandered toward where the elusive spellcaster might be hiding.\nAnd the safest place she could think of... was the palace of the Demon Lord himself.\nShe knew it was a gamble. But something in her gut told her she was right. If the demons were truly as dim-witted as they seemed, and the spellcaster was vital to even the Dark Lord's plans, then there was only one place he'd be kept safe—right under Astaroth's protection.\nSo when Austin left to scout the enemy territory, Rhea quietly slipped away from their shelter, pretending she was just going for a short walk.\nA few nights ago, Austin had mentioned that she bore the bloodline of the legendary Hero, Kane. That blood made her immune to the acid rain that burned everyone else. So, under the pouring sky, she walked unharmed, moving swiftly through the warped lands of the demonic realm.\nHer memory served her well, and soon, she stood before the Demon King's palace.\nSurprisingly, the palace's defenses were light. Perhaps most of the guards had been relocated to protect the Succubus Queen. Rhea couldn't sense any overwhelming presence here either. If her instincts were right, Demon Lord Astaroth wasn't home.\nWithout hesitation, she slipped into the palace and searched every hall and corridor, driven by a single goal. Eventually, she found a path that led underground, into a chilling, eerie chamber.\nThere, seated on an altar and surrounded by a glowing magic circle, was a twisted, ghastly demon.\nRhea didn't need confirmation—she just knew. This was the one. The spellcaster behind the acid rain. The one who had sealed the skies.\nAnd she didn't hesitate.\nWith a surge of ether, she launched her strongest attack, shattering the magical barrier around him. The moment his protection fell, she charged, cutting him down without mercy.\nRhea's hatred for demons spared none. She loathed every last one of them with all her heart.\nAnd because of what she did that day, Austin now saw this battle as equal.\nThe skies began to clear. With the sun returning, the balance tipped in their favor. Demons were weaker under sunlight—and William, who had once been on the brink, now stood strong.\nAll his wounds had healed. His breathing was steady. He was ready again.\n\"Nice tactics... but you'll still lose,\" Zephyr called out, his voice sharp and mocking. Blood continued to pour from his wound, now streaming rapidly down his body like a cursed river.\nThe Dragon King growled, raising his claw and pointing it at William. \"That piece is mine to slaughter. Don't get in my way!\"\nWith a roar, he lunged forward—turning into a blur.\nBut this time—\nClang!\nWilliam intercepted him. With a swift pivot on his toes, he slashed his blade down in one smooth arc.\nThe Dragon King's eyes widened as blood burst from his arm.\nHethroth snarled, ready to retaliate—but before he could launch his next attack, Zephyr dashed past him, aiming a brutal kick toward William's head.\nSHWIIK!\nBut he had to halt mid-motion, ducking at the last moment to avoid an arrow whizzing toward him.\n\"Don't forget about me,\" Austin called out with a grin, holding up his crossbow—his Shard now transformed.\nZephyr narrowed his eyes. \"You rely on its variants now? You disgrace such a beautiful Shard.\" With that, he raised his arm and fired an arrow at Austin.\nBut with his sharpened senses, Austin leaned back effortlessly, the arrow slicing just above his nose.\nThen came another.\nAustin exhaled and raised his hand calmly, catching the second arrow by its shaft mid-air. \"You're too predictable,\" he muttered, his smirk unfading.\nZephyr grinned, \"You think so? Check your hand.\"\nAustin narrowed his eyes as he looked at his hand and found black markings had begun to spread.\nHe sighed before placing Scar against his hand, \"Petty trick, man...\" Scar absorbed the poison since it was made of dark water.\nZephyr's expression shifted as he switched weapons, now relying on a sharp knife.\nAustin also changed his weapons, wielding a dagger; the og Shard.\nOn the other hand, Rhea and Valerie would currently tag teaming against the Demoness.\nThe demoness cracked her whip, the weapon glowing with a dark, sickly light. Anything it touched withered and rotted in seconds—even the stone floor hissed where it struck. Her lips curled into a seductive smile as she vanished into thin air.\nFwip!\n\"Illusion!\" Valerie shouted, spinning her spear in a wide arc to guard her back.\nRhea didn't flinch. Her eyes scanned the air. \"She's close,\" she muttered, flipping her crossbow into place and firing an ether bolt toward a shimmer in the mist.\nTHUNK!\nA cry echoed—half fury, half surprise—as the Queen flickered back into view, the bolt grazing her cheek.\n\"You'll regret that,\" she hissed, her whip lashing out.\nValerie dashed in, raising her spear just in time. The whip struck the shaft, and though it cracked with corrosion, her ice magic flared—sealing over the damaged part with a layer of frost. She countered with a thrust, sending shards of ice flying forward.\nThe Succubus Queen backflipped, landing on a floating platform she conjured mid-air.\nRhea didn't wait. She holstered her crossbow and drew her blade, dashing forward with speed that blurred her figure. \"Cover me!\"\nValerie slammed her spear into the ground. A ring of frost spread out in all directions, coating the battlefield and slowing the Queen's movement. \"Go!\"\nWith a roar, Rhea leaped upward, slashing in a spinning arc. The Queen dodged, but not fast enough—Rhea's sword sliced her shoulder, drawing black blood.\nThe demoness growled. Her eyes glowed red, and the illusions came alive—dozens of her copies surrounded them.\nRhea landed in a crouch. \"Tch. Again?\"\nBut Valerie smiled. \"Let's clear the fakes.\"\nShe spun her spear above her head, gathering a wave of icy wind before slamming it down. A blast of frost burst outward—shattering the illusions in a second.\n\"There!\" Rhea yelled, spotting the real Queen and firing a quick bolt.\nSkrrk! The Queen sidestepped, but the bolt scratched her thigh. She stumbled.\nValerie didn't let the chance slip. She charged in, spear first, and Rhea followed from the side.\nTogether, they attacked in perfect rhythm—blade, bolt, and spear in a blur of cold steel and magic.\nThe Succubus Queen tried to defend, her whip striking out, but Rhea ducked beneath it and slashed across her torso, while Valerie drove her spear into the Queen's leg.\nShe screamed.\n\"KHAAAAA!\" Dark energy erupted from the Demoness, making the two girls pause for a moment.\nHer red eyes were directed at Valerie and Rhea as the Demoness muttered, \"Enough of your madness!\"\nSuddenly, darkness enveloped the two teenagers, and their minds turned heavy.\nRhea struggled to remain focused as she swayed slightly.\n\"You two would pay the price for humiliating me in front of my Lord!\" She roared, her voice making Rhea's knees buckle.\nHer mind was telling her to move forward and kill the bitch. But a stronger side of her mind was forcing her to kneel and obey. She was conflicted even though she knew she shouldn't be.\nThis woman was her enemy, not someone to worship. Rhea was well aware that it was her skill that was making her feel like this.\nBut she was helplessly shaking and just trying to collect herself.\nSoon, Valerie also fell to the ground, her body trembling as her Shard fell to the side.\nThe Succubus Queen moved toward the two with a smug grin across her face.\n\"That's your fate. Despite how much you try to defy it, you will never surpass us, the ones who will be ruling over you very soon.\"\nInside the domain, no one is spared from her charm. She didn't want to use this skill against maggots but she couldn't allow herself to get humiliated further.\nShe lifted her leg and pressed it on Valerie's head, \"You aren't speaking anything, bitch? How about you apologize by licking my feet?\"\nValerie raised her hand...but rather delicately holding her feet she grabbed her ankle.\n\"Hmm?!\" The Demoness frowned and stared in disbelief as frost began to surround her leg.\n\"How did you...\" She couldn't get to finish her words as Valerie shot her cold glare at the woman, shutting her up.\nShe slowly rose to her feet, all while staring at her, as she said, \"You shouldn't have done it...approaching my Lord and then hurting him, you shouldn't have done it.\"\nThe Demoness ground her teeth, her once beautiful face morphing into something horrifying. Her teeth turned sharp like nails and her skin grew dark as she hissed and tried to jump on her.\nBut Valerie was prepared.\n*Thunk*\nA single tap of her Shard and the Demoness froze.\nNot in ice but in the time chamber.\nA cage that stops the flow of time and ceases the existence of a being regardless of its strength.\nThe domain shattered, revealing the outside world.\nAnd the moment every eye turned towards the frozen and dead Demoness...hell bent loose.\n\"HOW DARE YOU!\"\nThe demon Lord was enraged and his blood lust made Valerie fall on her knees, a cobweb forming beneath her.\nShe grunted in pain, but soon, it disappeared as a shimmering barrier surrounded her.\nAustin stood between the enraged Demon and his lover, his blade humming in anger.\nIt was time for the final battle.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"Huff... Huff...\" Olivia panted heavily. Her breaths were ragged, each one dragging like it scraped against her lungs.\nIt had been over thirty minutes since the battle began—but not once had she gotten a moment's rest.\nDemons lunged at her from every side, relentless and bloodthirsty. She had been fighting non-stop, her limbs aching, her skin scorched in places by the cursed ember rain that still shimmered faintly in the distance.\nBut finally—relief.\nThe dark clouds parted as the sun broke through, casting golden light over the bloodstained earth. A warmth that cut through the cold despair clinging to her.\nFor now, a shimmering barrier stood between her and the demonic horde, holding them at bay. A translucent dome humming with Charlotte's magic.\nBut beyond it—\nDarkness.\nCountless figures.\nSo many demons pressed against the barrier that Olivia couldn't even see the sky anymore. They clawed and slammed into it, their bodies forming a seething wall of chaos.\nIf Charlotte hadn't stayed hidden and cast this shield, Olivia would've already been torn apart.\nShe was grateful.\nBut she knew it wouldn't last.\nThe barrier was quivering under the endless barrage of claws, weapons, and brute strength. Charlotte was strong—but no one could withstand this forever.\nClenching her fists tight enough for her knuckles to go white, Olivia shouted—\n\"REMOVE IT!\"\nThe moment her fist struck the ground—\nBOOOOOOOM!\nA blast of translucent energy erupted from her, rippling outwards like a tidal wave. The ground cracked. Demons were thrown back, their screeches filling the air as they crashed into one another like broken dolls.\nDust rose.\nThe air trembled.\nAnd Olivia stood in the heart of it all—panting but defiant.\nShe finally had space to breathe. But she didn't stop.\nHer goal was clear: kill as many demons as possible, then charge into the fort to support her comrades inside.\nYet almost as if the world heard her inner desire for a worthy challenge—\nThe battle came to her.\nCRACK!\nA deafening noise tore through the battlefield as the front wall of the fort split. Bricks exploded outward and a figure was sent flying through the air like a broken arrow.\nIt was William.\nHis golden hair caught the sunlight just before he crashed, breaking through the outer barricade.\nCharlotte, quick as ever, threw up a barrier wall.\nTHUMP!\nWilliam hit it hard, grunting as his body slid down to his knees. Blood ran down his lip, but he forced himself to stand.\nThen it came—\nA roar that split the skies.\n\"RRRRAAAAAUUUUUUGHHHHH!!\"\nA world-shattering, bone-deep scream that froze Olivia in place. It shook the ground, rolled across the plains like a storm, and reverberated in her chest like a drum of war.\nHer eyes widened in horror as a massive, red-scaled dragon burst through the remains of the wall, shattering stone and steel alike.\nIts wings spread wide, casting a shadow that swallowed the light.\nFrom behind it, two figures shot into the sky, their speed tearing through the air like lightning.\nOlivia's heart skipped.\nShe couldn't even follow their movements.\nOnly flashes.\nOnly streaks.\nTheir clashes thundered like storms, ripples of raw force cracking the skies as they collided again and again.\nShe tried to keep track, eyes darting wildly—but her vision blurred.\n\"I... I can't follow them,\" she whispered, voice shaking.\nThen—\nA voice behind her.\n\"That's the Demon King.\"\nShe spun.\nIt was Selner.\nShe hadn't even noticed her arrive, but now the woman stood just behind her, cradling Valerie and Rhea in her arms. Both unconscious, bloodied but alive.\nSelner gently laid them down on the scorched earth.\nHer gaze lifted to the sky.\nUnlike Olivia's eyes, which struggled to keep up, Selner's weren't even moving.\nYet it felt like she could see everything.\nEvery clash.\nEvery motion.\n\"What happened to them?\" Olivia asked, her gaze fixed on the unconscious forms of Valerie and Rhea.\nSelner didn't take her eyes off the sky.\n\"They couldn't withstand Astaroth's presence. It's normal.\"\nHer voice was calm, but there was a heaviness to it.\nAstaroth—the embodiment of darkness.\nHis mere presence gnawed at the soul, drowning all hope and joy like a slow, merciless tide. It wasn't pain he brought—it was emptiness, like someone peeling away the light inside you, stealing every trace of strength, courage, or purpose.\nThe two girls had already been through too much—trapped inside the Demoness's Domain for too long. Their minds were frayed, their spirits worn.\nIt made sense. But it didn't make it easier to watch.\nIf not for them, Selner wouldn't have shown up here at all.\nSuddenly—\nBOOOOOOM!!\nA thunderous explosion cracked the sky. A figure was blasted downward, trailing smoke and sparks before slamming into the earth with a crushing impact.\nThe ground shook.\nOlivia's heart dropped.\n\"Tell me that wasn't Austin...\" she whispered, hoping—pleading.\nBut Selner said nothing.\nHer silence was louder than any answer.\nOlivia's hands clenched into fists, her jaw tight with anger and fear. She stepped forward, ready to rush toward the fallen figure.\nBut her body jerked back.\n\"Ou-ou—what the hell?!\" Olivia stumbled as a hand gripped her collar, pulling her in place.\nSelner's expression didn't change.\n\"That's not a battle you should interfere with,\" she said coldly, pointing in the other direction.\nThere, in the distance, a human clashed with a massive dragon, their battle a blur of roars, fire, and steel.\n\"Go help him.\"\nOlivia exhaled sharply, irritation flickering across her face—but she knew Selner was right.\nWithout a word, she turned, bent her knees, and launched herself toward the dragon.\nThe beast noticed her mid-air.\nIts massive, blood-stained body twisted, and with a loud whip of force, it swung its thick tail toward her like a hammer.\nBut Olivia only grinned.\nShe extended her hand forward—and gravity bent.\nPulling herself faster, she slipped right beneath the sweeping tail and twisted in the air. With perfect aim, she drove her fist into the still-open wound William had carved earlier.\nSPLAT!\n\"ARGHOOOOO!!\"\nThe dragon shrieked, its cry shaking the air as it staggered backward, smoke and blood pouring from the gash.\nOlivia landed, crouched and steady, a smirk curling her lips.\n\"That's one for Austin.\"\nThe dragon let out a guttural growl before rolling to its left, its massive, armored body crashing against the ground like a collapsing mountain.\nOlivia's eyes widened.\nShe turned to run—but she knew she wasn't fast enough.\n\"Shi—!\"\nTHANG!!\nA shimmering barrier flared to life in front of her, just in time to halt the dragon's momentum. Dust exploded around her, heat brushing against her skin.\n\"HURRY!\"\nCharlotte's desperate voice rang out from not so afar.\nOlivia didn't hesitate. She kicked off the ground and launched herself away. The very next instant, the barrier snapped like glass, shards of light scattering through the air as the dragon's body resumed its motion.\nWilliam regrouped with Olivia and Charlotte. The three of them now stood side by side, facing the towering beast as it slowly rose again, blood dripping from its wounded side.\nThen—\nThe dragon reeled its massive head back, maw wide open.\nThe air around them began to twist as a swirling inferno gathered in its throat. Flames spun like a miniature sun behind its jagged fangs. Heat surged outward in waves, drying sweat and pulling the breath from their lungs.\nThey knew what was coming.\nThe Dragon's breath.\nBig enough to burn the whole field to ash.\nWilliam stepped forward, planting his feet firmly.\nHe raised his sword high—\nSunlight poured into the blade, rays of light bending unnaturally toward the steel. His aura flared golden, cutting through the gloom.\nOlivia clenched her gauntlets, pulling every drop of soul energy she could muster. Her fists burned with power, veins glowing faintly beneath her skin.\nCharlotte stood trembling, her hands lifted. She was prepared to give everything she had to shield the others.\nThe dragon opened its mouth—\nA second more and—\nSHLINNNNMK\nA sharp, crystalline note pierced the tension.\nA single projectile—almost invisible—ripped through space.\nIt phased past the dragon's neck.\nThen—\nTHUD.\nThe dragon's eyes widened.\nAnd then its head dropped with a dull, final sound.\nThe monstrous body froze—\nThen collapsed, heavy and lifeless.\n\"…huh?\"\n\"…what?\"\n\"…shit… the fuck?\"\nThe three stared in disbelief. Their attacks still charged, their bodies still bracing for death.\nThen their eyes turned.\nToward the source of the shot.\nThere—\nStanding calmly amidst the fading light of battle—was a teenage girl with bright pink hair, flowing upward as if untouched by gravity. Her eyes glowed with ethereal light, twin orbs of sheer power.\nA gentle breeze passed.\nEven the battlefield grew silent.\nShe turned towards Astaroth, who was still levitating in the air, before raising her Shard, which now had turned into a huge bow.\nShe pulled the string, her veins bulging before releasing the arrow.\nAstaroth growled but didn't move.\nHis General appeared in the way and deflected the arrow.\nThe arrow struck the ground far away and an explosion shook the ground.\nZephyr narrowed his eyes at the pink head, \"It's been a long...Hero Kane.\"\nRhea didn't respond.\nSteam appeared as she parted her mouth.\nHer body was enveloped in violent energy.\nA moment of silence and then the two warriors vanished.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- She is the protagonist, of course these kinds of situations would awaken something in her.\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "The air cracked. The two figures appeared and vanished in quick succession.\nThe battle was roaring through the battlefield. Neither of the two is ready to yield.\nRhea lunged forward, blade flashing like a bolt of silver. Her boots tore through the dirt, leaving a gouged trail behind. Zephyr barely leaned aside in time—her sword grazed his cloak, slicing it clean.\nTHUNK!\nA bolt flew from his crossbow—straight at her head.\nCLANG!\nShe deflected it mid-air with a sharp twist of her wrist, spinning low to close the gap. Zephyr recalled the crossbow and whipped out his curved elven knife, eyes sharp, movements sharper.\nThey clashed.\nSteel howled.\nRhea's strikes came fast—downward slash, sweeping cut, feint—then a sudden thrust that tore through a tree behind Zephyr as he flipped over her shoulder.\nBOOM!\nThe tree split in half and crashed to the ground.\nZephyr landed and instantly darted sideways, his speed unnatural. He fired a second bolt from a smaller wrist-mounted bow. Rhea bent backward—it missed her by an inch.\nShe didn't stop.\nDashing forward, she slammed her shoulder into him. The impact shook the ground—cracks webbed out under their feet. Zephyr slid back, feet skidding, knife raised just in time to block another furious overhead slash.\nCLANG! SPARKS!\nRhea pushed harder. Their blades locked, her strength pressing down. Zephyr gritted his teeth and twisted, breaking the clash with a sidestep and a slash aimed at her ribs.\nShe spun, avoided it, and struck with the back of her blade—THWACK!\nHis chestplate was dented. He flew back and slammed into a rock—CRASH!—shattering it.\nDust exploded around him.\nRhea charged through it.\nZephyr vanished again—flickering to her side with elven speed—and slashed. Blood drew from her shoulder.\nBut she didn't slow.\nShe twisted, grabbed his wrist, and yanked him mid-spin before headbutting him—CRACK!\nHe stumbled, dazed, and her sword arced toward his neck.\nHe barely rolled away.\nThe blade struck the ground—\nBOOOOM!\nA crater opened where he had stood.\nThe earth shook. Chunks of stone flew. Trees swayed from the force.\nZephyr coughed, kneeling, switching his knife back to a bolt. He fired.\nRhea tilted her head. It grazed her cheek—but she was already there.\nWith a roar, she slammed her foot into his chest—sending him flying across the battlefield like a ragdoll.\nHe crashed through a pillar. Then another.\nHe slowly got up, while Rhea remained standing, her eyes filled with nothing but madness as she prepared another assault.\n\"This won't last long,\" came a voice from Austin's side.\nHe was holding Valerie in his arms. The other three S-ranks had also gathered, eyes locked on the battlefield ahead—a storm of destruction caused by two superhuman warriors.\nWilliam stood frozen, mouth slightly open, barely able to track the clashing figures. Only the shockwaves and roars of combat thundered in his ears, shaking the ground beneath them.\n\"I know,\" Austin muttered, eyes focused on Rhea.\nShe had awakened—but not without cost. The sudden surge of power was tearing through her body like wildfire. If she didn't stop soon, she'd break... or lose herself entirely.\nNeither was an option.\n\"We need to get Rhea out of there and then hunt down Astaroth,\" Austin whispered to himself, his mind racing. The demon lord was bound to launch a full-scale attack if left unchecked. But first, he had to stop that pink-haired storm from destroying herself.\n\"Austin.\"\nSelner placed a hand on his shoulder, her expression grave. \"Your homeland... it's under attack.\"\n\"...!!\"\nEveryone turned sharply.\n\"What happened?\" Olivia was the first to demand.\nSelner's voice was clipped, urgent. \"The Hellstains—every one of them across the nation—they erupted all at once. Hundreds of demons came pouring out.\"\nAustin's breath caught.\nThe blood-mark of Astaroth.\nWith the demon king's awakening... of course they would awaken too.\n\"Fuck.\"\nHe gently passed Valerie to Selner, crouched low—and launched.\nZephyr spotted him in the air and raised his crossbow.\nSPLING!\nThe arrow flew with deadly force—\n—but Rhea stepped in.\nShe bit into the arrow, snapped it in her teeth, and spat out the broken pieces like bone.\nZephyr's face twisted in frustration, but before he could react, Austin sent a razor-sharp slash his way, forcing the elf chief to dodge with a growl.\nAustin landed behind Rhea just as she was about to follow Zephyr into the next strike.\nHer glowing eyes were wild. Veins bulged beneath her skin, and heat rolled off her like steam from a boiling forge. Her body was nearing collapse.\n\"Rhea,\" Austin called calmly. \"It's enough now. Calm down.\"\nShe turned, teeth clenched, fists trembling.\nShe was ready to fight him too.\nAustin raised his hands to show he meant no harm and slowly stepped closer. \"Our home is under attack. We need to—\"\nHis words were cut short.\nWHOOSH!\nShe swung.\nThe blade screamed through the air. Austin barely dodged. The blow shattered the fort's wall behind them like paper.\nShe roared, spinning, and went for his neck.\nTNNG!\nHer sword stopped mid-air.\nA green barrier pulsed around him. The Absolute Barrier—unmoving, unbreakable.\nRhea blinked, confused. She slashed again, and again.\nNothing.\nNot even a scratch.\nAustin sighed, \"She's gone full beast...\"\nHer mind was drowning in power. If he let her go, she'd burn herself alive.\nAnd then, a mocking voice echoed from above.\n\"Quite pitiful, you humans are,\" Astaroth sneered from high in the sky, arms crossed like a god watching insects. \"So, tell me... what now, Hero? Will you fight me? Save your friend? Or run home to protect your precious people?\"\nThat smile of his stretched unnaturally wide.\nAustin didn't even blink. \"Oh, I can do all that.\"\nSuddenly—\n[Resonant Bond: Activated!]\n[Target acquired!]\n[Connection built!]\nAstaroth raised an eyebrow.\nBut before he could speak—\nAustin raised his arms, gripping Kane's bow.\nAstaroth's eyes widened.\n\"Where did you—\"\nHe didn't get to finish.\nAustin loosed the string—\n—a glowing arrow shot through the air with near-invisible speed.\nToo fast to evade.\nZephyr moved on instinct.\nSHHHK!\nHe stepped in front of Astaroth—just in time.\nThe arrow hit him clean in the chest, and Zephyr screamed.\nThe energy corroded him—his exoskeleton cracked and hissed.\n\"Fucking scar…\" he growled, falling to one knee.\nAustin didn't smile, but his eyes narrowed with purpose. He dropped the barrier and caught the unconscious Rhea before she could fall.\nThen, without ever turning his back on Astaroth, he leapt back and regrouped with the others.\nAnd still—\nAstaroth didn't move.\nHis gaze followed them with eerie calm, lips tight. He whispered to himself,\n\"He's changed... That power—was it those winged ones meddling again?\"\nHe narrowed his eyes.\nThere were answers he needed to uncover.\nSoon.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. I am depressed.",

      "content": "For the first time in his life, Austin regretted coming home.\nHe stood frozen—Valerie limp and unconscious in his arms—staring at the burning capital that once felt like the center of his world.\nDemons still swarmed through the city like a black tide. Soldiers screamed, fought, or fled. Civilians lay dead across the blood-soaked streets. Flames licked the skies from shattered windows and fallen roofs. The once-bright city was drowned in a sea of ash and crimson.\nEverything he loved…\nEverything he swore to protect...\nGone.\nHe took a step forward.\nThe Absolute Barrier pulsed softly around him, keeping the demons at bay. Or maybe... they were just too afraid to come close. Maybe they felt it—that he had nothing left to lose.\nHe couldn't look up. He couldn't let his eyes wander.\nBecause if he did, he would break.\nThe screams… they never stopped.\nChildren calling for their parents.\nMothers sobbing for their babies.\nThe dying whispering last prayers to gods that had already abandoned them.\nEvery step felt heavier than the last. Blood clung to his boots. Smoke stung his eyes, but it wasn't the reason they watered.\nAll around him were memories—now turned into corpses and rubble.\nHis heart clenched when he saw the head of the kind old shopkeeper who used to save Austin's favorite crepes, just in case he dropped by late.\nHe used to greet Austin with a warm smile. That smile was gone now… ripped away and left in the dirt.\nThe demons hadn't spared anyone. They had stormed churches and orphanages and butchered the helpless without a thought. Tiny shoes lay scattered on the chapel steps—bloodied, empty.\nAnd Austin?\nHe could do nothing but walk.\nWalk and grieve.\nBecause of this...\nThis wasn't just a battle.\nIt was a graveyard.\nAnd he was too late.\nHe soon reached the main palace.\nThe defenses were gone. Torn to pieces. Demons had already clawed their way through the gates like a tide of nightmares.\nDHAK\nHis foot struck the ground.\nEvery demon in range collapsed. Flesh peeling, bones shattering—consumed by an unseen force.\nIt wasn't Scar.\nIt was Austin's soul.\nAnd it was weeping.\nTearing apart with every step he took.\nWherever he walked, demons died. Some tried to flee. Some tried to fight. None survived.\nHe entered the palace.\nInside, it was no different—hell in motion.\nDemons rampaged through the grand halls, mauling soldiers and ripping servants limb from limb. The white marbled floors were drowned in blood.\nTheir goal was clear: exterminate every last human.\nThen he saw it.\nTears blurred his vision as he stumbled across Robert, his father's aide. Demons feasted on his guts while he still twitched—still alive.\nDHAK\nAustin stepped again. Another pulse. Another massacre.\nThe demons dropped, dead before they even realized what hit them.\nHe stopped beside Robert, whose pale eyes somehow still held awareness.\n\"Sorry… I was late...\" Austin whispered.\nAnd in that dying moment—\nRobert smiled.\nGentle.\nWarm.\nForgiving.\nAustin's throat tightened. His legs wavered.\nHe nearly fell—until someone caught him.\nA frail hand.\nHe turned to see Caroline, one of the palace maids. She was drenched in blood, her left arm missing entirely. She looked barely alive, swaying with every breath.\n\"Caroline...\" he breathed, quickly pulling out a potion.\nShe stopped him.\n\"N-Not me...\" she gasped. \"The King...\"\nShe pointed toward the gallery ahead.\nAustin hesitated but pressed the bottle to her lips anyway.\nShe drank it, tears leaking from her eyes—not from pain, but from fear. From regret.\nThen he ran.\nEach step is heavier than the last.\nEach breath felt like swallowing shards of glass.\nHis heart screamed at him to stop—to turn away.\nBut he couldn't.\nHe had to keep going.\nHe had to see what was left. He had to help whoever still lived.\nAnother demon he saw in the corridor ahead—huge, wielding a bloodied club.\nAustin didn't blink.\nHe clenched his fist—\n—and the demon exploded, stripped to the bone before it could swing.\nHe soon approached the person he was about to attack...and his heart stopped for a moment.\n\"M...aa...\" His vision blurred, and his legs grew wobbly as he fell to his knees.\nValerie fell from his hands but at the moment, he could see nothing...feel nothing.\nAll he saw was his mother...\nHer lower body...it was gone...torn away.\nBlood pooled around her.\nShe was hugging his father with one hand and the other one was raised against her face to defend against the club.\nHearing his voice, Sophie flinched.\nWith every ounce of energy she had, she looked at him.\n\"A-Austin...\" She called out, her eyes suddenly turning watery and relief washing over her face.\nWhy was she relieved and not in pain...why was she...forcing herself like this?\n\"Austin...my child...c-can you come closer?\" She requested, her face paler than a sheet.\nAustin was weeping, tears continued to flow continuously down his eyes.\n\"Not fair...you...cannot leave me like this...\"\nHe slowly approached her, his face full of tears.\n\"I-I am sorry...I can't protect your father...\" She said, her voice laced with grief.\nAustin looked at his lifeless father...no longer breathing, no longer smiling...just lying there.\n\"D-Dad...I am back...\" He called out, his voice hoarse, \"...won't you pat my back...won't you hug your son? I am back...p-please talk to me..just once...\"\nHis voice was desperate...begging.\nBut he didn't wake up.\nHe didn't say a word.\nHe was angry at him. Upset that despite he trusted his son so much...Austin failed him.\n\"Child,\" Sophie called out, somehow clarity returning to her voice, \"...can you do us a favor?\"\nAustin couldn't look at his mother. His eyes closed, and tears continued to flow down.\nHe couldn't breathe...couldn't think. He was mad at himself.\nSophie didn't have much time, so she extended her request, \"Can you rest our bodies in the same coffin-\"\n\"No, please!\" Austin shouted, \"...don't say it as if you are leaving me...abandoning him!\" He can't live without them. He had finally got a family...and now they are leaving him again.\nTurning towards her, he helplessly said, \"...I still haven't forgiven you...how can you...leave me? Please don't go, ma...\" He held her hand, tenderly.\nIt had been so long since he held her hand...the warmth...the comfort...he wanted to feel it again.\n\"I am S-Sorry *cough*\" she coughed blood which Austin caught in his hand, hoping that it might change something. But it was nothing but a hopeless prayer.\nSophie looked at him tenderly, \"...sorry, Austin...Mother will go ahead...but maybe...someday...visit my grave if you have forgiven me.\"\nAustin's chest welled with emotions as he clenched his fist.\nJust then, the shade of blood reminded him of something.\nThe Elixir!\nHe instantly took out the Elixir from his inventory and just as he took out the lid,\n\"It won't work. I am prolonging her life through my magic.\" Selner called out.\nAustin gritted his teeth and shook his head.\nHe brought the vial to his mother's lips and softly said, \"Drink it, ma...please...\"\nSophie could feel the desperation in his voice...and even though she knew it wouldn't make a difference she drank it.\nAustin waited...and waited.\nAnd then, he turned towards Selner. His eyes pleading, begging her to say what he wanted to hear.\nBut all Selner could do was shake her head.\nAustin's shoulders slumped, his face turning pale...all hope vanishing from his eyes.\nSelner couldn't bear to look at him.\nThis was the second time she had seen him like this, and the second time as well; she felt...all her life would have been worthless if she couldn't help the man she loved.\nAustin was held by his mother. Her warmth was slowly fading.\nHe knew...it was not going to change.\nHis parents...they are leaving him after all.\nAt that moment, he stopped crying or moving.\nHe refused to look at her.\nHe just sat there, lifelessly.\nSophie gently relayed, her voice barely above a whisper, \"Austin...can you promise me something?\"\nHe didn't say anything. Just sat there.\nHe refused to face reality.\nHowever, Sophie knew she had only a few seconds left.\nDespite how much she wanted to hug her son...to comfort him, she couldn't.\nSo, she slowly relayed, \"A-After...w-we die...d-don't live for revenge...l-live for yourself....you have...your sister...and Val. So please promise...\"\nAnd her voice trailed off.\nThe small flickering light in her eyes vanished.\nThere was a smile on her face, relieved that she passed away while looking at her child.\nAustin didn't move from there for a long time.\nSelner stood beside him silently, her eyes moist but there was nothing she could do.\nThe only person who could have comforted him was unconscious.\nBut at the moment, not even Valerie could have stopped the flame arising in his chest.\nHis soul was enraged...eager to burn something.\n'System...take me to the dungeon...'\nHe was wrong all along.\nPlanning... teamwork...that no longer matters.\nHe has to do it alone.\nAstaroth needs to die.\nAnd he would die the same day his parents left him.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Austin was in the tenth dungeon.\nHe had conquered the last three over the past seven months.\nDespite the rage burning inside him and the grief clinging to his chest, he couldn't rush through the dungeons. Not if he wanted to survive.\nCharging in without a clear mind would only get him kicked out—permanently.\nSeven months without seeing Valerie.\nSeven months since his parents left him behind.\nSeven long months.\nHe didn't know what he would do with all the experience he'd gathered. But there was one thing he was absolutely certain of:\nThe Demon Lord was going to die.\nBy his hands.\nNo more teamwork. No more asking for permission.\nHe was going to slaughter them all—their forces, their kin, and finally, the one who started it all.\n[The host hasn't taken a nap for the past ninety hours.]\nThe system's voice echoed in his mind.\nAustin exhaled a tired breath. \"Do I look tired to you?\"\n[You have accumulated stress over the past two days. Eight hours of sleep is recommended.]\nApparently, his system had taken the role of a health advisor.\nNot that he could complain. If it wasn't for her, he wouldn't have come this far.\nHe knew that if he completed this dungeon, he could assimilate the fourth fragment.\nA crucial step—one that would make him whole again.\nAnd once that happened… Astaroth's countdown would begin.\n\"Haah... if you say so,\" Austin muttered as he lay down on the cold, barren ground, folding his arms behind his head like a makeshift pillow.\nHe stared at the dark, unmoving sky. His eyes were blank.\nHe knew what this world had in store. The dangers it concealed.\nHe had been warned—through the game in his previous life.\nHe had the strength now to change things.\nHe had the potential to end the greatest threat humanity had ever faced.\nBut despite all those advantages… he couldn't protect the ones who truly mattered.\nValerie, too, had come dangerously close to the edge. When the Succubus Queen expanded her domain, darkness nearly swallowed her.\nIf not for the training she'd endured under Selner—if not for her past experience with the Demoness and her mind-bending charms—she might've ended up just like his parents.\n'This world is unfair.'\nIt was broken. Imbalanced.\nDemons were not only stronger, they outnumbered humans by the tens of thousands.\nHumans boasted a handful of warriors—elite S-rankers they clung to like lifelines. But what good are a few powerful names when the enemy can flood cities with endless hordes?\nThey could march into human lands whenever they wished...\nAnd crush everything people hold dear under their feet.\n\"Hmm?\" Austin turned his head, feeling an unexpected warmth brushing against his side.\nGolden light particles floated beside him, soft and gentle, clinging to his arm like fragile fireflies refusing to drift away.\n[Are you upset?]\nThe system's voice was quiet—tinged with something that sounded almost... sad.\nAustin stared at the sky, then exhaled a long breath.\n\"There aren't many people I truly wish to protect,\" he murmured. \"And the Demon Lord knew exactly who to target to break me.\"\nA faint, bitter smile rose on his lips.\n\"In a way… he succeeded. He did break me.\"\nThe system didn't respond at first. The silence stretched for a few seconds before she asked softly,\n[Would it be difficult… to continue your life like this?]\nAustin let out a weak chuckle. \"I have Valerie,\" he said. \"So I know I won't be drowning in sadness all the time...\"\nBut then his gaze drifted. It grew distant, his tone dimmer.\n\"...Still, I know that from time to time—maybe even often—I'll be reminded. Of them. The ones who cared about me. The ones I wanted to keep safe.\"\nHe hadn't moved on from Rudolph and Sebastian. Not really.\nHe still visited their graves—every day—kneeling in front of the cold stone, whispering things about his daily life and apologizing for not being able to protect them.\nHe failed them.\nHe thought he had made a smart move—dealing a heavy blow to the enemy. But in truth, it had been a trap. A setup.\nAll of it was designed not to kill him… but to crush his heart.\n[Then...]\nThe system's voice broke the silence again, gently pulling him back to the present.\n[...would you like to change everything?]\nAustin blinked. \"What... do you mean by that?\"\nHis voice was hoarse. Tired.\nThere was nothing left to change. Not anymore.\nThey were gone. His friends. His parents. Everyone he had clung to when the world turned dark.\nEven the Elixir—his final hope to save her—had failed.\nHe had already let go of hope.\n[There is a way to bring them back.]\nThe words cut through the air like lightning.\n[All of them. A chance to revive this world and the people you adore.]\nBa-dum.\nHis heartbeat jumped.\nWas this… real?\nCould such a thing truly be possible?\nTo go back in time.\nTo undo everything.\nTo stop the pain before it began?\n\"S-System,\" Austin's voice shook, barely above a whisper. \"Please tell me you aren't joking.\"\n[Why would I joke about something so important?]\nHer tone was steady now. Unshaken.\n[There is a way. A path to return. A path to rewrite those moments that brought you to your knees.]\nSlowly, almost in disbelief, Austin stood up.\nHe turned to face the golden light floating beside him, shimmering like a small sun that had waited patiently for him to believe again.\n\"Tell me...\" he whispered, eyes trembling. \"Tell me what I need to do. I'll do anything to bring them back.\"\nThere was no hesitation in his voice.\nOnly longing. Only hope.\nAnd a heart that refused to let go—no matter how much it had already lost.\n[Do you remember you were granted a skill after returning from the Demonic Realm… after rescuing Adam Corwon?]\nThe system's words echoed gently, but there was a heaviness behind them.\nAustin's brow furrowed. He thought for a moment—then his eyes widened slightly.\n\"Yes… I remember,\" he said slowly. \"The skill that forced you to reboot.\"\nHe clenched his fists as the memory returned in full.\nThat day, the System had gone silent for a while. Unresponsive. It was the first time she had acted… strange.\nAs if the skill came with a bug.\nThe System's voice returned—now serious, and a bit gloomy.\n[I found the source of that disturbance. There are forces—entities—that watch over this world. Beings obsessed with balance.]\nAustin's heart sank.\nIt didn't take him long to understand.\n\"The Divine Beings,\" he said under his breath. \"The gods.\"\nIn the game, they had only been mentioned in whispers—in old books, hidden dialogues, discarded files. They were always vague, almost like myths. But there was one detail that never changed.\nThey believed in balance.\nNot peace.\nNot war.\nBalance.\nAnd balance didn't care about good or evil. It didn't care who was crying or who was laughing.\nIf darkness grew too large, it would bring light.\nIf light shined too brightly, it would call the dark.\n\"They don't care about extinction...\" Austin muttered. \"They just want everything to stay... equal.\"\nThe System confirmed with a quiet hum.\n[Yes. To them, light and darkness are both necessary. Neither should win. Neither should be erased.]\nHe bit his lower lip.\n\"And they don't interfere directly with mortals, do they?\"\n[No. Just like the Witches.]\nA chill ran down Austin's spine.\nHe remembered now—Witches were also forbidden from acting freely in the mortal world. Their power was too vast. One step out of line, and everything would shift.\nTheir favor could tilt a nation. Their hatred could erase one.\nThat explained the laws. The silence. The reason even the witches stayed behind the veil.\nBecause if they moved, the gods would move too.\nAnd when gods move… worlds break.\nAustin felt something cold settle in his chest.\n\"So... that skill...\" he whispered.\n\"It was being blocked by the deities?\" Despite how absurd it sounded, the system confirmed,\n[Yes. They were the bugs that were hindering me. But I got rid of their influence and can allow you to use it.]\nAustin felt a little better, but then he asked, \"There must be a catch, right?\" Surely, not everything goes as he wishes.\nThe system remained silent for a bit before saying,\n[You must remember, Host; what the system is about to grant you won't be liked by those beings. They might descend to the mortal realm to stop you.]\nAustin's eyes turned cold as he heard her adding,\n[Are you willing to go against those Primordial Beings? Not just the demons, you might have to raise your sword against the Gods as well.]\n[Tell me, Austin, are you prepared to take that risk?]\nNot even a second passed before the answer arrived, \"Yes, I am.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- From demon slayer to God slayer. Well, I had this in mind for a long time, that's why the skill was named as Divine Mockery.\nThanks for reading.",

      "content": "The last obstacle that stood between Austin and the fourth fragment was the goblin King: Baelak.\nThis whole floor was filled with goblins, those creatures who are generally considered as the level one monsters, the nightmare of the beginners. And here, they were ruling the tenth floor.\nAustin narrowed his eyes on the twenty-foot-tall green creature, which had pointed downward ears and slim limbs that surely would allow it for unrestrained movements.\nThe magical presence it was extruding was simply astonishing.\nJust based on its magical presence, this being was stronger than Astaroth.\n\"It's time,\" Austin muttered as he saw the timer of the resting zone nearing zero.\nHe summoned his newly acquired weapon—Twin Vipers. A long-range weapon consisting of a long chain with two blades attached to both ends.\nAustin took a deep breath. He no longer felt the nervousness as before, maybe because now he was one hundred percent sure of his victory.\nHe knew his goal wasn't to defeat this creature but something beyond this.\nAs such, he must fight.\n[BZZZZZ!]\nAs the buzzer resonated, the two beings became alive and moving.\nHis chained twin daggers spun in a blur at his sides, metal ringing sharply in the thick, choking air.\nThe moment the Goblin King lifted the scythe—WHOOM—a wave of dark energy slashed out. A crescent of crackling force tore toward him.\nAustin dove under it, the wave shearing through boulders behind him like butter.\nHe rolled, launched off the ground, and hurled one dagger mid-air. The chain rattled, stretching out like a silver streak. It coiled around the monster's wrist, digging in. With a pull and a twist, Austin yanked himself toward the giant, feet first, eyes locked on the scythe.\nBut the Goblin King reacted fast. With one clean slice—SHINK—he severed his own hand, letting the dagger fall with the limp stump. Blood hissed as the limb rapidly regrew, bone cracking and flesh twisting in seconds.\nAustin clicked his tongue and twisted mid-air. His other dagger flashed. He slashed at the beast's side as he passed, carving a deep red line into its ribs.\nThe Goblin King roared, spinning, and brought his scythe down.\nBOOM.\nAustin barely dodged, landing in a slide. The blade struck where he'd been a heartbeat ago, splitting the earth open. Cracks raced out, swallowing chunks of the arena.\nFrom a distance, the monster launched another slash, sending a wide arc of dark force. Austin dashed left, then right, weaving through the air-blades with inhuman speed. But one caught his chain.\nSSSHHH!\nA glowing rot spread across the linked metal, crawling toward his hilt like burning mold.\nAustin clicked the mechanism. Snap. The infected length dropped away. He reattached the loose dagger, chain shortened but clean.\nNo time to think. The Goblin King charged—quicker than anything that size should be.\nAustin sprinted forward to meet him.\nAt the last second, he jumped, springing off the monster's knee. His chain slithered through the air, wrapping around the Goblin King's horns. He yanked himself up and over, dragging the beast's head down.\nAnother dagger slash. He carved a mark across the Goblin King's forehead—but the rot had spread again. Austin's blade hissed red where it touched flesh.\nHe tossed the infected weapon, letting it fly. It was embedded into a tree, sizzling.\nThe Goblin King ripped free of the chain, hand bleeding but grinning with empty eyes.\nHe swept his scythe low, carving a trench. Austin flipped over the blade, landed on the monster's back, and drove his second dagger in.\nThe King spun violently, trying to throw him off.\nTrees shattered. Stone crumbled.\nBut Austin held on—barely.\nThe Goblin King smashed his back into a cliff wall. CRACK! Austin's breath flew from his lungs.\nBut in the end, he had what he needed.\nHe twisted, used the monster's own movement to flip upward, and landed right above the beast's head.\nTwin daggers back in hand—he'd called the other one back with a flick of the remaining chain.\nBoth blades plunged down.\nThe Goblin King grabbed him mid-strike, claws sinking into his side. Blood sprayed.\nBut Austin's blades had already touched the crown of the beast's skull—rot spread fast, bright red and searing.\nIn rage, the monster slashed his own head, cleaving the infected part off.\nBut Austin had already vaulted away, panting, crouched, one hand on the ground.\nThe Goblin King stood tall again. Fresh flesh. Fresh rage.\nThe two exchanged a gaze before the Goblin King slammed his weapon on the ground—drawing several dark chains from the ground that darted toward Austin\nA brief moment of panic before Austin backflipped and narrowly missed the chain.\nHe knew he would experience a world of pain if they clung to him, so he continued to back off rapidly, side-stepping, jumping, and ducking to keep those corrosive restraints away.\n**SPRING**\nThe last chain sprang faster than any other, urging Austin to rely on his instincts rather than calculated movements—however, the leap was so great that he never noticed the movement behind him\n\"THE FUCK!\" He cursed aloud as he landed just against the Goblin King.\nBaelak didn't waste time before caging Austin in his arms and crushing him with the intention of squeezing his life.\n\"Agh ...shit!\" Austin grimaced, but couldn't get away with brute force. His limbs creaked because of the force and just when he realised he couldn't overpower him,\n\"Berserk!\" He cried and instantly strength surged through his body, allowing him to liberate himself from the excruciating pain.\n\"*AGHUOO*\" Baelak narrowed its eyes, not pleased with the defeat.\nHowever, Austin didn't give him time to grieve.\nHe was prepared for another strike. Twin Vipers now stored away, and all he had were his two hands.\nThe Goblin King responded in kind and pumped his fists.\nA moment of silence passed.\nThen they vanished.\nAustin ducked just in time.\nCRACK!\nBaelak's massive fist swung through the air and smashed into a distant rock, shattering it into dust.\nAustin rolled, then pushed forward. His fist shot upward like a cannon, crashing into Baelak's ribs.\nBOOM!\nThe giant stumbled back five steps, the shockwave blasting a nearby boulder into pieces. But Baelak laughed.\nSWISH!\nBaelak blurred again. His speed didn't match his size—he moved like a shadow. He spun mid-air, delivering a heel kick.\nAustin crossed his arms.\nBANG!\nThe impact flung him a hundred feet across the field, carving a trench where his body scraped the ground. But before the dust could settle—\nHe was up.\nAustin's foot cracked the earth as he launched himself back in.\nBAM!\nTHUMP!\nCRASH!\nFist met flesh. Elbow met jaw. The sounds of the battle echoed like thunder across the wasteland. Austin ducked, stepped in, and drove his knee into Baelak's stomach.\nBaelak roared, spit flying, and clapped both hands around Austin's sides like a bear trap.\nKRAK!\nThe ground crumpled beneath them.\nBut Austin didn't flinch.\nHis hand shot up—fingers locked—and punched Baelak square under the chin.\nBaelak's head jerked back. Blood splattered. Austin spun, using the momentum to land a roundhouse to the side of Baelak's face.\nThe king flew.\nBOOOOM!\nA hill behind them exploded as Baelak crashed through it.\nAustin took a breath.\nBut Baelak was already up. Bleeding, grinning. His speed didn't drop.\nHe ran. Each step crushed the land beneath.\nAustin ran too.\nThey collided mid-air.\nKAA-THOOM!\nThe sky flashed white for a moment.\nTheir fists met. Both were pushed back, feet dragging long scars across the earth.\nThey grinned at the same time.\nHowever, Austin suddenly relaxed his shoulders, confusing Baelak.\n\"You were a good warm-up, mate.\" He said, as he released the effect of Berserk, \"But now I think I am prepared.\"\n[Indeed, host. Your soul is more than ready to consume the fourth fragment.]\nCame the confirmation.\nSuddenly, darkness enveloped his left hand. It was as if raging fire, dark in shade, had consumed his arm but it didn't affect the boy at all.\nThe Goblin King felt danger from the darkness that was consuming all light and hope.\nAustin's soul has become one with Scar, as such, there was no need for him to give it a physical form\nAustin himself was a Shard now.\nHe took a step towards his enemy.\nThe creature took a step back, clearly wary.\nBut then, something pushed the King from behind, a shimmering barrier and Austin launched from his spot.\nThe two beings drew closer, and just in time, Baelak raised his fist to strike back.\nAustin easily pushed the punch away and lightly tapped the Goblin's chest.\n\"*AGHUOOOOOO!*\" A cry that can traumatize a man for life, resonated through the barren dungeon floor as the black flames consumed the creature.\nAustin stepped away and didn't bother to see what conclusion the final boss reached.\nHe stood in the middle of the dungeon, and called out, \"It's time to put the final piece in place.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Sitting on the cliff, Austin looked down at the scene beneath him.\nIt was dark, endless. Dared to swallow whatever or whoever falls into it.\nA sweet tune came from the darkness. A fragrance that overwrote the sweetest fragrance Austin had ever inhaled.\nThe darkness was tempting. It was overpowering.\nAustin knew for sure that if he jumped now, he would never have to fear anything. No demons, no Gods. He would be above everything.\nThen...isn't that a wonderful thing? Who doesn't want to be on top? Who doesn't want to be invincible....immortal?\n\"Are you seriously thinking of jumping?\" Came a familiar voice. A little too familiar since it belonged to him.\nAustin glanced at his older self, standing there with his hands in his pockets.\nHe was looking into the darkness as well.\nAustin asked his older self, \"Did you jump? Did you accept it?\"\nThe older him shrugged, \"I had tasted it...unintentionally. It was too tempting for my four-year-old self.\"\nAustin's brows elevated, \"That was the time you awakened. So Scar tempted you to give in.\" That explains why the older he got, the fewer human emotions he had left.\nHe gave in.\nHe surrendered to Scar.\nThe older one sighed, \"Took me a long time to realize that the embrace of darkness is actually affecting me in a way I couldn't have expected.\"\n\"It was rotting you, making you inhumane and urging you to become the strongest so you can dominate the world,\" Austin spoke what his older version would have.\n\"Keeping the world safe means someone strong has to rule over it—that's what I believed.\" He said, looking tired, \"I was wrong. And the one who helped me realize it was Selner.\"\n\"The only human emotion you felt was for her. You loved her.\" Austin spoke, leaned back, and rested his weight on his hands.\nThe older one sat down beside his younger self and stared at the blank space below them.\n\"True power asks for sacrifice. That's what I believed but I didn't want to accept it. That's why, I wished to be...someone like you.\" Side-glancing at him, the older one added, \"You are the perfect version of me, yet I see you despairing. And that...fills my heart with peace.\"\nAustin understood exactly what he meant. Despair and grief come from human relations and emotions, and the older version of him wanted exactly this from his new version.\nEmotional connections.\n\"I really want to punch you for that,\" Austin spoke with a dry chuckle.\nThe late Hero tilted his head, \"So...what do you plan on doing now? You need to jump if you wish to fight the Gods.\"\nAustin was aware.\nUnless he becomes one with Death, the darkness he possesses, he wouldn't be able to face those Primordial beings who rule over the concept of the world.\nIf Austin wanted to save everyone, he had to sacrifice the human in him.\nAnd with that, he would lose all his feelings for Valerie.\n\"You are at a very...difficult stage at the moment. Choosing our parents and the people we love would cost you, Valerie. And if you remain with Valerie, you will spend the rest of your life under the burden of their death.\"\nAustin sighed, \"You are not making this easier.\" He leaned forward, rested his arms on his thighs.\n\"You are me, so I know exactly what you must be feeling or thinking at the moment.\"\nAustin shook his head, \"Nope, you aren't me. I am different.\"\nThe older he hummed, \"True...you are better. But that doesn't change the fact that I am right. You are standing at a very critical point.\"\nAustin nodded, \"Yeah...that...is true.\"\nA long, heavy silence descended upon the duo and the only thing that kept the scene alive was the sweet tune flowing from the darkness.\n\"Have you wondered what that is?\" Austin asked, with his gaze never wavering from the Darkness...the fourth fragment of his soul.\n\"Never got any information. Selner didn't know about it.\" Glancing at his younger self, he asked, \"What about the system?\"\nAustin shook his head, \"She doesn't know as well...however, she hinted that it could be related to one of the Primordials.\"\n\"Damn...\" That was...shocking. But then, it explains why Austin, despite being a human awakened such an overwhelming Shard.\nAnother brief silence before the older one asked, \"Time is drawing close. You have to make a choice now.\"\nAustin calmly responded, \"I have long made the choice.\" He raised his hand and suddenly all the darkness started to swirl, gather.\nUnder the confused gaze of the other Austin, Austin gathered the darkness at the tip of his index finger.\nAll that darkness that could envelop a planet had gathered on top of his finger.\nAustin brought it to his lips and swallowed it.\n\"Woah...was that alright?\" Asked the older him.\nAustin didn't answer right away. His eyes were closed. Dark veins protruding on his neck and arms...probably all over his body.\nHis aura shifted, the dreamscape quaking by his presence.\nCracks formed around the cliff but neither of them panicked or showed any intentions to move.\nThe older one was staring at his other version.\nMeanwhile, Austin slowly assimilated the rage and greed Scar brought along.\nHe didn't hasten it, he didn't need to. He was still in the dungeon, and he trusted the system to keep him safe. So, he took all the time he needed to tame the darkness.\nUnlike his previous self, he didn't need to hand himself over to Scar. He would dominate it. And he succeeded.\n\"You seem ready now.\" Came the voice from his left as Austin opened his eyes.\nAustin looked at his hand, clenched it, and loosened it.\n\"It doesn't feel too different.\"\nThe older him casually responded, \"Isn't it because you have been channeling Scar even when your Soul was pitifully weak?\"\nAustin chuckled, \"I am disappointed.\"\nThe other him got up and faced him, \"Well, I think this is enough for you to deal with what is to come.\"\nAustin coldly stated, \"Nothing can stop me from slaughtering that vermin now.\"\n°°°°°°°°\n\"Ah-\" Selner's breath was caught in her throat as she hurriedly looked back at Austin.\nHe was...crying until a moment ago, crouching beside his dead parents, and now...he seemed like a completely different person.\nShe staggered back, looking shocked as she asked, \"You....absorbed the fourth...\"\nAustin looked at her, \"Yes, I did.\"\n\"C-Can you show me your Shard?\" She asked, showing great concern given that the fourth fragment was stronger than the other three altogether.\nShe still remembers the sensation she felt when she touched his fourth fragment. So tempting...so ominous.\nShe was concerned about his Soul. Although she knew that he had a way to strengthen his soul within seconds using a different dimension, it was still too astounding to think a second was enough for him to assimilate the fourth fragment.\nShe extended her hand, expecting him to summon the black sword; however, all he did was extend his hand as well.\nSelner showed confusion for a moment, before asking, \"Where is your Shard?\"\nAustin shrugged, \"I swallowed it.\"\n\"...\" Selner stared at him for a good three seconds before she finally decided to trust his words and take his hand.\nHer brows instantly frowned...as she felt it. The dark and overwhelming sensation coming from his soul.\nMeanwhile, Austin glanced at his parents. Their lifeless face allowed him to regain the rage and grief once again.\nHe rested his hand on his father's chest and softly muttered, \"I will bring you back, Father.\"\n\"Hmm?!\" Selner asked as she heard him, \"What did you just say?\"\nAustin didn't have any reason to hide it from her, so he told her, \"I am regressing. One of the gifts from the system.\"\n\"...!\" Selner's eyes widened.\nGoing back in time...she has heard it before, after all, it was she who made it possible.\nHowever, this time it was not a witch getting involved. And that brings the question, \"...how are you going to face the wrath of the divine ones?\"\nIt was the first time Selner broke a law, which is why all her sisters stood by her side and protected her. But...Austin was alone and even with Selner's support, he wouldn't be able to face them.\nAustin looked nonchalant, \"Do you think I care about those beings who didn't move a finger when demons slaughtered my people?\"\n\"But Austin-\"\n\"Selner.\" Austin called out, \"I am doing this. I have made the decision.\" He was firm with his decision.\nNothing was going to stop him.\nSelner remained silent for a moment before she glanced at the fallen violet-haired teenager nearby before she said,\n\"Have you thought about Valerie?\"\nAustin paused.\n\"She won't be able to go back in time...and she will forget everything...every beautiful moment she has spent with you.\" She looked back at Austin before asking, \"Are you ready to make that sacrifice?\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "There was a heavy silence in the conference room. Every council head was present—except for the two who had died during the ambush. William and Olivia sat among them, grim-faced.\nCharlotte wasn't here. Her wounds were too severe to move.\nNo one had gathered to blame William. They knew he hadn't caused this. Even if he had been on this side when the attack hit, there was no way he could've stopped something so massive on his own.\nDemons had swept across every major city in every nation. It wasn't just the Hellstains. Hundreds of demons surged through the SOS, like they'd been waiting—waiting for the strongest defenders to leave, so they could strike with no resistance.\n\"Three S-rank warriors gave their lives fighting the ancient Phoenix to protect the headquarters,\" said one of the council heads, placing a thick file on the table. It contained the names of the fallen.\nOver seventy thousand were dead. More than twenty thousand had sacrificed themselves. Two council heads had been caught in the crossfire. Killed instantly.\nWilliam stared at the list, jaw clenched, hands trembling.\nHe hadn't been there. He was locked in battle with a demon on the other side while his people were being massacred.\n\"There was nothing more you could've done, Warrior,\" said one of the older heads, his voice tired.\n\"That's right,\" another added. \"The attack was too wide. We were unprepared.\"\nBut it didn't matter what they said. William couldn't stop blaming himself.\nWhat was the point of all this power… if he couldn't use it to protect anyone?\n\"It was a trap,\" one of the heads muttered grimly. \"The Demon Lord planned this. He waited until both William and Austin were out of reach.\"\nBut then Olivia spoke, correcting him with quiet fury, \"No. That bastard didn't just want to win a battle. He wanted to break us. That's why he waited until we were gone—to hit the people we loved.\"\nShe had lost her grandparents. She knew exactly how Austin felt.\nAstaroth hadn't just ambushed them. He'd shattered them from the inside.\nThe room fell into a brief, tense silence.\nThen William stood.\n\"I'm going to attack the Demon Lord,\" he said. \"Today.\"\nGasps rang out around the table. Shock filled the air like lightning.\nHe was still wounded. The Demon Lord had barely been scratched during their last clash—and he'd be ready this time.\nFor William to go now…\nIt was suicide.\n\"You can't,\" one of the council heads said, voice firm. \"And this time, we will stop you if we have to.\"\nThe others didn't speak, but their eyes said the same. Hard. Resolute.\nOlivia leaned forward, her voice steady but pained. \"Sorry, Will... but I agree with them. I won't let you go to the other side. Not like this. Not in the shape you're in.\"\nWilliam snapped.\n\"Then what the hell do you want me to do? Sit here and grieve? Wait for them to strike again—watch them slowly wipe us out while we just hope it won't be as bad next time?!\"\nHis voice cracked at the end, raw with anguish. He was hurting—torn between rage and helplessness.\nThe weight in his chest wouldn't leave him. It pressed down like a curse.\nHe couldn't forget the sight of those hundreds of bodies, lined up on the cold earth. The lifeless faces. The silence of the dead.\nWatching them be buried, one by one, made him feel like tearing out his heart—or ending it all right then and there.\nA suffocating silence fell over the hall.\nNo one dared speak. Because deep down, they understood.\nWilliam was the only one among them with no hunger for power. No personal ambitions. He just wanted peace. He lived to protect others.\nAnd now, he stood here—lost, broken—feeling like everything he lived for had been shattered.\nThe heavy silence was pierced by the sound of approaching footsteps.\nThen a voice—cool and calm—echoed through the hall.\n\"Well, here's something to ease your wounded hearts.\"\nAustin stepped inside and, without warning, tossed something toward the center of the table.\nThud.\nEveryone's eyes snapped away from Austin and toward the object that now rested on the table.\nAnd then—\n\"...!!\"\n\"What the—?!\"\n\"Holy shit!\"\n\"Wait...that face… no way!\"\nBlood drained from their faces as they stared at the head lying before them—eyes rolled back, fresh blood dripping from the torn flesh where the neck had once been.\nThere was no mistaking it.\n\"The Demon Lord?! Did you kill him?\" one of the officers blurted out, pushing back his chair and standing abruptly.\nAustin gave a lazy shrug. \"Well, I doubt Astaroth gave me his head as a gift.\"\nHe walked around the table and dropped into the seat beside Olivia, casually throwing his feet up onto the polished surface.\nNo one scolded him. No one even moved.\nThey were still trying to process what they were seeing.\nThe Demon King... dead?\nJust like that?\nBut then a suspicious voice cut through the awe.\n\"Wait a second... you're not pulling the same trick you did with Thea's Shard, are you?\"\nAll eyes turned to Austin again, now laced with both hope and caution.\nBecause if this was real—if Astaroth was truly dead—then the world had just changed forever.\nAustin let out a long sigh, rubbing the back of his neck—but before he could say anything, someone else spoke.\n\"No, it's him,\" William said, voice low and firm. His brows drew together as he studied the head on the table. \"I can still feel the Darkness in the blood... There's no doubt. This head belongs to the Demon Lord.\"\nThe room fell utterly still.\nThe realization settled like a thick fog, spreading through each heart. No more questions needed to be asked.\nThis was real.\nThe Demon Lord was dead.\n\"…Just how?\" Olivia whispered.\nShe almost never looked shaken—but now, her expression was one of disbelief. And rightly so.\nTwo days ago, this creature nearly wiped them out. Backed by an army. Untouchable.\nNow his severed head sat on the table.\n\"Took me two days,\" Austin muttered. \"Honestly, I'm disappointed in myself. I wanted to kill him the day he murdered my parents… but the bastard was fast. Kept running.\"\nHis voice was calm, but his words sent a chill down every spine in the room.\nJust how powerful had he become… in only two days?\n\"Then… there's no commander left on the other side?\" one of the council heads asked hesitantly.\nAustin shook his head. \"For now? No. The throne is empty.\"\nA flicker of hope sparked in the room—but it didn't last.\n\"But the Demon King isn't truly dead,\" Austin added.\nOlivia sucked in a sharp breath. William's eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean?\"\nAustin looked at the bloodied head again and spoke with quiet finality. \"Did I forget to mention? He broke his soul into several fragments. Hid them all over the world so that he could never truly die. This one—\" he pointed at the severed head, \"—was his second-last fragment.\"\nEveryone stiffened.\nThe short-lived relief shattered like glass.\nThe final piece… was still out there.\nThey exchanged uneasy glances, the weight of the moment pressing back down on them.\nBut beneath that fear, something else had taken root: belief.\nBecause now they knew—one warrior could shift the tides of war alone.\nAustin had done what armies couldn't.\nAt that moment, no one doubted it anymore. He was the strongest warrior in the world.\n\"So… what now?\" Olivia asked softly. \"We just wait?\"\n\"Can't we search for the last piece and end this once and for all?\"\nAustin shook his head. \"It's nearly impossible. He could've hidden it anywhere. And the vessel could be anything—an object no one would ever think to look at. You can't sense it unless you're almost right on top of it.\"\nHis meaning was clear.\nIf it were something he could hunt down… he'd already be out there doing it.\nBut even the strongest man in the world couldn't fight what he couldn't find.\n\"Then we must wait,\" William called out, \"Prepare since I know that after losing all his Generals and after being humiliated by Austin, Astaroth would rush for a direct assault.\"\n\"That's right,\" Austin confirmed, \"He would go for all in, attacking from several sides so that we get confused and feel helpless. He would attack every single thing which we hold dear. So yes, be prepared.\"\nA nervous silence settled in the room, everyone carefully considering the words spoken.\nAfter a long pause, Austin soon got up.\n\"Ummm...won't you stay? We can discuss the strategy-\"\n\"I have a funeral to attend.\" Austin's words completely shut off the lady.\nWithout another words, Austin stepped out and found Selner standing there.\nWordlessly they nodded before they started to walk out of the building.\nIt's time.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "\"Are you nervous?\" Rhea asked, gently adjusting Valerie's dress.\nThe violet-haired bride took a deep breath. \"Yes... a little bit.\"\nIt was understandable. After all, today, she was going to become a bride.\nThe bride of her Lord.\nIt had all happened so suddenly. Just a few days after their parents' funeral, her Lord had proposed to her—asking her to marry him.\nShe was stunned. But even then, rejecting him never crossed her mind.\nSo, she nodded. With a quiet, trembling smile.\nAnd now, here they were, in the church—Valerie getting ready for the ceremony.\nShe glanced at the pink-haired girl kneeling before her and softly asked,\n\"Hey... how are you holding up?\"\nRhea paused for a moment, flinching slightly. Then she resumed fixing the hem of the gown.\nDuring the ambush, every place even slightly connected to Austin was attacked. Rudolph's home, Sebastian's family—it was as if someone searched through Austin's head to dig out those names.\nThe Academy was one of them.\nThe headmaster, most of the students, and even Morkel... all lost their lives.\nValerie's parents hadn't been spared either. Just two days ago, she held their funeral.\nEveryone they loved, everyone they shared memories with—\nEither clinging to life... or buried beneath the earth.\n\"It's probably the worst thing to say on your wedding day, Valerie...\" Rhea murmured, her voice low and cracked. \"But I don't think I'll ever recover from this.\"\nNot just Morkel—but all her friends at the Academy. The memories, the laughter, the bonds—torn apart by demons.\nIf it weren't for Austin asking her to come today, Rhea would've locked herself in her room again.\nValerie gently placed a hand on her shoulder. \"You can talk about it if you want.\"\nRhea let out a small chuckle.\nWho would've thought she'd be comforted by Valerie—the same girl who once couldn't stand her.\n\"I will. But not today,\" she said with a soft smile as she stood up. \"Today is a happy day. You're becoming one with the man you love. No crying. Just smiling.\"\nValerie smiled too and rose to her feet. \"How do I look?\"\nRhea took a step back, giving her a proper look. She scanned her from head to toe, then nodded.\n\"Pretty enough to make me fall for you.\"\nValerie laughed gently, shaking her head. And then—\nKnock knock.\n\"The ceremony is about to begin,\" came a voice from behind the door.\nValerie exhaled a long breath and looked at Rhea, who stepped forward.\nShe fixed the veil, carefully placing it over Valerie's head.\nAnd then, arm in arm, the two of them stepped out of the room.\n....\nAustin was pretty much nervous as he stood on the stage in a crisp black suit and waited for his beloved.\nThere were a few people gathered in the church. Mostly from Valerie's side.\nThe only person Austin could identify was Caroline—one of the maids he saved.\nShe smiled at him and gave a brief nod to be confident.\nAustin smiled in response before he heard the Father saying, \"It's very assuring to have you on our side, Sir Austin.\"\nAustin hummed, \"What do you mean?\"\n\"News about the Demon Lord's demise has spread like wildfire.\" He added, \"And the Council gave you full credit on it.\"\nAustin's brows elevated. It was ...slightly concerning that the Council had declared the ultimate enemy, dead.\n\"Did they not mention anything else? Something concerning?\" He asked.\nThe Priest nodded, his expression turning grim, \"The last obstacle still remains. The broken last fragment of his soul still persists.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh of relief. At least, humans won't start celebrating yet.\n\"But I know,\" the older one added, \"...that until you and warriors like Valerie and William are on our side, we will never lose.\"\nAustin had a dejected smile on his face, \"Well, there is nothing much to protect now.\"\nThe Priest's smile faltered for a moment as he realized what grief the boy was hiding behind that smile.\nHe approached Austin and rested his hand on Austin's shoulder before saying, \"I am in no position to say this, but sacrifices are a sign that we are on the path of peace.\"\n\"My heart breaks whenever I remember all those funerals I have attended, thanks to their efforts, the human race still exists.\"\nAustin softly smiled, \"Sacrifice means a path to peace, huh?\" Well, he got another push to do it.\nTo go back in time.\nIt was then,\nThe heavy doors opened.\nValerie stood there, framed in soft light. Her gown was white as winter snow, smooth and flowing, with a long veil that trailed behind her like mist. The fabric clung gently to her frame, catching the light with every step. She held a small bouquet of white roses in both hands, her fingers trembling slightly. But her face—her face was calm, proud, and impossibly beautiful.\nEven the silence seemed to pause for her.\nHer eyes stayed fixed ahead. She wasn't rushing. She walked slowly, each step measured, graceful. The small crowd watched as if afraid to blink and miss something.\nBeside the aisle, Rhea stood in a soft blue dress, holding Valerie's trail. Her expression was soft, proud, and full of quiet joy. Her hair was neatly tied, her hands careful and steady as she helped her friend move forward. She glanced at Valerie's face—so steady, so radiant—and smiled to herself.\nThere weren't many guests, but that didn't matter.\nIn that moment, with the gentle sunlight touching her gown and the hush of the church wrapped around her like a blessing, Valerie looked like something out of a dream. Not just a bride—but a queen, walking toward a new chapter with quiet fire in her eyes.\nAll Austin could do was stare at her in silence as she stood before him.\nSomehow Valerie could feel his thoughts at the moment. And she couldn't hold herself from smiling at how much he was admiring her with his eyes.\n\"Val...I...will you marry me?\" He asked again, a little nervous that this angel might not feel him worthy to stand by her side.\nShe was just breathtaking.\nValerie leaned closer before softly relaying, \"Even if you ask a hundred times, the answer will be the same.\" With her bright eyes looking into his, she said, \"Yes...I will marry you.\"\nAustin took a deep breath as he calmed his heart rate.\nGod...why does she have to look so gorgeous?\n\"Should we begin the vow?\"\nAustin tore his eyes away from Valerie, barely, before telling the Priest, \"Is it important to follow the lines?\"\nThe Priest blinked in surprise before closing the small book and urging, \"It's the promise\n\"I don't promise a perfect life.\nBut I promise you my whole heart—on the quiet days, on the stormy ones, and on all the days in between.\nI vow to hold your hand when it trembles,\nTo listen when words are hard to find,\nTo stand beside you when the world feels heavy,\nAnd to laugh with you when it's light again.\nI will not try to fix you,\nBut I will love every broken, shining part of you.\nYou are my home,\nNot because you make things easy,\nBut because you make them matter.\nFrom this day on, I walk with you—\nNot behind, not ahead—but beside you,\nAs your partner, your shelter, your constant.\nI may not always have the right words,\nBut I will always choose you—\nIn every season, in every breath,\nFor the rest of my life.\"\nWhen he finished, there were tears in Valerie's eyes and so were in the eyes of the audience.\n\"I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride now,\" The priest said.\nAustin slowly lifted the veil, now being able to see her face clearly.\nSlightly red cheeks, moist eyes, and a face that brought serenity to his heart.\n\"I have imagined this moment over a thousand times.\"\nValerie lowered her gaze shyly then she slowly looked up.\nAustin leaned toward her.\nValerie closed her eyes and tilted her head.\nTheir lips soon met in a soft embrace.\nTears began to well in her eyes as Valerie felt her heart melt at the touch of his lips.\nIt felt like they had crossed a very tall hurdle to reach here.\nSo many obstacles. So many times Valerie believed that they might not become one. At one point, they nearly drifted apart, Valerie lost all her hopes to be one with her Lord.\nHowever, things changed for good.\nThey grew closer, closer than she could have ever prayed for and now, they were standing here, taking the oath to be always together.\nShe can never be more happy than this.\nHowever, at that time she didn't know that the black clouds of gloom were approaching.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Next chapter would be their wedding night and after that some tears.\nThank you for staying with me so far. Drop a comment.",

      "content": "Valerie and Austin were currently on the couch, panting and sweating as they sat with their nether region connected.\nThey had been making love, and enjoying their wedding night for the past three hours. Entangled in each other's bodies, and desperately seeking each other as if the world were nearing its death.\nAustin ran his fingers up her naked back, making her shiver as he whispered, \"You are amazing. I can barely feel my heart racing this much these days.\"\nHis heartbeat could be heard in the back of his throat, and it wasn't just the excitement of doing the deed but also the beauty she possessed.\nValerie slowly lifted herself off his heated rod, groaning as she did.\nHer hips convulsed slightly, still too affected by the eye-rolling orgasm she had.\nShe could feel his seed flowing down her vagina, making her shiver slightly as she lowered herself and knelt face to face with the majestic thing which has been exploring her insides until now.\nValerie took a moment to admire it...it was coated with his white seeds and the juices of excitement she released earlier.\nThe union of both filled her heart with warmth as she softly grabbed his thing.\nAs she slowly began to jerk his semi-erect manhood, Austin said, \"You don't have to.\"\n\"But I want to.\" She said before giving the tip a soft lick.\nA chill of pleasure coursed through his body as Austin clutched the corner of the couch and leaned back.\nValerie's left hand moved up and down, slowly jerking his thing while her tongue tasted every bit of what once was inside her.\nThe softness of her tongue and her slick hand smoothly pumping his thing was enough to make him hard again.\nHowever, just when Austin believed she would stop and ride him once again—God, he loved that—he suddenly found his length being enveloped in warmth.\nAustin's brows elevated as he saw Valerie's lips around his thing, as she went down and down.\nShe looked up at him as her left hand never stopped working.\n\"Oh, Val...this feels great.\" Austin slowly got up.\nHe didn't want to reject her intentions to provide him with this heavenly pleasure.\nValerie had easier access now. She has slowly learned that Austin loved it when she did this.\nShe never went this far but after learning from the books a bit, she knew how to do it, and what she shouldn't.\nWith her tongue sticking to his base, she moved her head back and forth.\nAustin gently held her hair and threw his head back.\nThis was too much.\n\"Val...feels amazing...\" He mumbled, couldn't explain what he was feeling right now.\nValerie couldn't take the whole length in her mouth at once but she tried as far as she could.\nHer eyes watered as her throat was completely filled his tip touched the back of her throat.\nShe somehow prevented herself from gagging and stayed right there for a few moments.\nAustin felt his orgasm building up but he needed a little push.\nHe looked down at his wife before asking, \"Can I move?\"\nValerie nodded ever so slightly before Austin slowly pulled back, only to push back with a slow stride.\nValerie braced herself as she left her body in his command and just enjoyed the sensation of his thing filling her mouth; feeling elated that she could give this much pleasure to her Lord.\nA few strokes were all he needed before Austin groaned,\n\"I am about to...agh!\" Just as he pulled, he began to release his seed on her face.\nValerie closed her eyes, a contented smile on her face as she received everything he had to offer.\nAustin felt guilty seeing the white splashes on her face as he crouched before her and slowly started to wipe the stains from her beautiful face.\nValerie opened her eyes and looked at his worried visage.\nHe softly wiped everything using the tissue paper as he heard her saying, \"When are you going to tell me?\"\nAustin exhaled a sigh, \"Not tonight,\" he knew exactly what she wanted to know.\nShe can read him like an open book; as such, his haste to marry her surely had made it clear that he was about to do something dangerous and life-changing.\nValerie got up and turned around.\nWith her feet on the ground, she rested her upper body on the bed, offering herself to him.\n\"Then claim me and erase all my worries.\"\nAustin sighed at the sight before him. Her slightly swollen pink lips invited him.\nHe stood up, his manhood already standing proud and raring to go.\nHe positioned himself behind her, slowly rubbing his tip against her entrance.\nValerie spread her legs slightly as she felt her inside getting filled with his girth once again.\n\"Nngh ....\" She moaned, grabbing the sheet and muffling her moan.\nAustin held her waist and pulled away before thrusting back in—their hips slapping and Valerie's body jerking forward\nThe slowly rhythmic sound of their mating echoed through the room, both getting drunk in the pleasure of love and lust.\nAustin pulled back her up, cupping her left breast and his lips meeting her neck.\nValerie shivered, moaning as she did, as she moved her waist in rhythm to match his pace.\nThe slow thrust scraping her insides, his body warmth, his slow kisses, and the soft kneading are the recipe to make the girl feel all kinds of stimulations.\nAustin lowered his hand and strummed over the small nub at the crown of her lower lip.\n\"Ahnn...that...ahhh...\" She encircled her arm around his neck and trembled all over.\nShe was nearing her limits and he knew it well.\nAustin lifted her up, strong arms holding her thighs as he turned towards the body-length warrior.\n\"Open your eyes and see us, Val.\"\nValerie did as demanded, and she was instantly astonished to look at herself in the mirror.\nHer face flushed, eyes moist, as she remained connected to her Lord.\nHis length was mostly swallowed by her sex, as he slowly moved up and down, not allowing her a moment of rest.\nHer juices were gushing out with each stroke, slathering his manhood.\n\"Don't show me...it's embarrasing-nngh!\" She moaned aloud as he sent a strong push into her inside.\n\"You look so damn hot right now,\" Austin growled as he brought her to the table, lying her down on her back before pushing his thing back inside her.\n\"Ah..ah...it...it feels good...!\" She screamed as he pumped in and out of her, making her feel euphoric.\nAustin held the edge of the table to stop it from moving as his thrusts began to hasten.\nHer body jerked, her breasts rippled with every push.\nThe room was now filled with loud noises of their wild sex.\nThey were no longer making love. They were dying in the color of pleasure. They were mating with the intention of producing a new life.\n\"Val...agh...\" Austin felt the sudden grip inside her as he pushed his manhood in the deepest point, and soon, he started to spray whatever was left.\nValerie's body convulsed, her toes curled as she felt orgasm hit for the seventh time.\nSlowly, Austin pulled away, breathing roughly as he asked her, \"Want to take a bath and then sleep?\"\nValerie was quite exhausted by the session so she just lifted her arms.\nAustin heard her wordless demand before holding the girl in a baby hug and bringing her to the bathroom.\n....needless to say, while washing her body, he got hard again and they did twice in the bathroom before Valerie fell asleep inside the bathing pool.\nAustin felt guilty for pushing her that far so he wiped her body and brought the girl to the bed.\nOnce he covered her body under the blanket, he put on a pair of shorts and brewed himself some tea.\nHe wasn't sleepy. He wasn't tired at all.\nHe could now go on without sleeping for days without allowing fatigue to become an obstacle in his path.\nTaking the cup of tea, he approached the window.\nParting the curtains, he opened the window and allowed the serene breeze to brush past his face.\nHe leaned against the window, took a sip before asking, \"I hope you didn't peek at us.\"\nA woman chuckled, as she slowly levitated higher and stood while facing him, \"I just arrived now.\"\nAustin narrowed his eyes, \"Well, I don't believe you.\"\nSelner shrugged, \"You know nothing could have prevented me from listening to you if I really wanted to.\" In a whispering voice, she added, \"But trust me, hearing my ex-husband making love to another woman can never be enjoyable for me.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh, \"So...why are you here?\"\nSelner's expression turned serious as she said, \"To tell you something about Astaroth...and his connection with the winged beings.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Years ago, a pact was made between a being on the edge of immortality and those who had already crossed that threshold.\nThe agreement placed limits on Astaroth's growth, in exchange for a promise—should the threat of complete extinction ever loom over him or his kind, the divine ones would intervene to protect him.\nIt was a deal where both sides gained something. For Astaroth, it was a guarantee: no matter what horrors emerged from the other side, he would survive. For the divine ones, it was peace of mind. A creature as twisted as him would never join their ranks.\nAstaroth's influence had already grown terrifyingly vast. Had he reached higher realms, it would've been catastrophic.\nSo, by keeping him bound to this world, they secured themselves. And in return, he earned the ultimate shield.\n\"Hmm, this is unexpected,\" Austin said, his voice steady as he leaned against the windowsill, eyes tracing the sky beyond.\nThe silence that followed was broken by a quiet question.\n\"Did you know about it from the beginning?\"\nSelner shook her head. \"Maybe my eldest sister saw your intentions. That's probably why she sent me the records of the pact she witnessed.\"\n\"Hmm~ impressive. I knew witches were old, but Astaroth has existed for over five thousand years.\"\nSelner nodded slightly. \"Our mother—the eldest witch alive—is a Primordial being. So, you can imagine how long we've been around.\"\nThat, too, was surprising. But Austin had other things to worry about.\n\"So if I go back in time and try to kill Astaroth… the winged ones will stand in my way.\"\n\"Without a doubt.\"\nAustin turned to glance at the witch beside him. \"Wouldn't that be a violation of the universal law? Immortals interfering with mortals?\"\nSelner shrugged. \"They can make exceptions when it suits them.\"\n\"Then so can you, right?\"\n\"…!!\"\nSelner's eyes slowly widened as he continued,\n\"I mean, if they can bend the law for their interest… You can too.\"\nSelner let out a dry smile. \"Even if I did step in, I doubt a young witch like me could last long against them.\"\n\"But would your sisters stay quiet if you were attacked?\"\n\"…\"\nShe had no words.\nBecause the answer was clear.\nWitch blood ran deeper than any pact. Their unity was unshakable. No matter how many times she had angered her sisters by standing beside Austin, Selner knew—they would never let her fight alone.\nHer eyes narrowed as she looked at him. \"Are you really using me as your shield?\"\nAustin shrugged. \"I won't ask you to help… but can you really stay on the sidelines when those pigeons come after me?\"\nShe didn't reply.\nAnd her silence was louder than any answer.\nNo—she couldn't watch them hunt him down. She knew it.\nAfter a pause, she let out a sigh. \"Seriously… I never thought you'd use my feelings like this.\"\nAustin smiled softly, warmth flickering in his eyes. \"I knew I could count on you.\"\nThe violet-haired witch huffed and turned her face away.\nA few moments passed before she asked, \"So… did you tell her?\"\nAustin exhaled slowly. \"Not yet. But tomorrow, I will—\"\n\"I want to know now,\" said an unexpected voice.\nValerie stepped forward, draped in a bedsheet, her bare shoulders peeking through the fabric. Her expression was gentle, but the worry in her eyes was unmistakable.\n\"Val…\" Austin turned to her, surprised by her sudden appearance. She looked at Selner instead.\n\"What is it, Selner?\" she asked, her voice calm but steady. She already knew something was weighing on Austin—something heavy enough to keep him quiet.\nSelner glanced at Austin, silently asking for permission. When he gave the faintest nod, she answered honestly.\n\"He's going back in time… to save everyone—and to kill Astaroth.\"\nValerie didn't react right away.\nShe looked down for a moment, then slowly said, \"I don't know why… but I was expecting something like this.\"\n\"You were?\" Austin asked, his voice touched with disbelief.\nShe gave a soft nod. \"When you didn't break down at your family's grave… I figured you had already found a way to bring them back. I thought maybe Selner was helping you.\"\nAustin shook his head. \"No… I received a reward. A chance. But the problem is…\" He paused, hesitating, then gently took her hand. \"You… you'll forget all of this. Everything we've shared.\"\nHe had already confirmed it with the system—he'd be sent back to the day his system awakened. The day Valerie was about to be framed. The day everything began.\n\"You won't remember anything. The laughter. The tears. The nights we spent together. All of it.\" His voice cracked with grief. \"Only I'll remember.\"\nValerie lowered her gaze to the floor. Silence stretched between them. Then, with a soft, shaking breath, she finally spoke.\n\"A few days ago… if you had told me this, I might have tried everything to stop you. I can't even begin to explain how much these memories mean to me… how precious they are.\"\nAustin stayed quiet, listening to every word.\n\"…But if I choose my memories over the people we lost… I don't think I could look myself in the mirror.\"\nShe lifted her gaze to meet his, her eyes shimmering. \"Since that day… since I saw my parents' bodies, I haven't been able to sleep properly. Every time I close my eyes, I see them. Every time I walk into the kitchen, I feel like Mom is standing there, watching me from the corner. And whenever I hold a weapon… I can almost hear Dad's voice, proud of me.\"\nHer voice trembled, the pain in her chest surfacing. \"I know this version of me will disappear the moment you go back in time… but I'll be okay with that.\"\nShe choked on her words, barely able to finish the sentence. The thought of losing those memories tore at her, but she knew… some things were greater than even love or memory.\nSome things were worth the sacrifice.\nAustin couldn't bring himself to say anything in return.\nInstead, he stepped closer and pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly against his chest.\nThe emotions swirling inside him left him helpless.\nFor the first time… he was choosing something over Valerie's happiness.\nFor the first time… he was protecting someone else, even if it meant pushing her away.\nFor the first time… he was breaking her heart—and his own.\nAnd it shattered him.\nHe buried his face in her shoulder, tightening his embrace as if that would stop time. As if holding her just a bit longer would make the pain go away.\nThey didn't notice when Selner quietly slipped away in night sky—leaving the two to talk things out.\nRight now, all they could focus on was each other.\nThey clung to that fragile warmth like it was the last piece of the world they could call theirs.\nBecause it was.\nThis moment—this breath, this heartbeat—they wanted to live it fully.\nTo burn it into the deepest corners of their souls.\nSo that even if time erased everything…\nEven if memory failed them…\nSomewhere, in a place beyond reason and fate, this moment would still remain.\n\"Can you tell my past self… about our wedding?\" Valerie asked softly—no, she pleaded.\nAustin's voice came out in a broken whisper, \"I will… I'll tell you everything…\"\n\"Please take care of me, Austin,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"My past self… she was timid. She hesitated to come near you. I might run away a few times… but don't let me go.\"\nHis arms tightened around her. His voice was quiet but resolute.\n\"I won't. Never.\"\nThey slowly pulled apart, just enough for her to cradle his face in her hands.\n\"Tomorrow…\" she paused, swallowing down her tears, \"can you take me on a date? One last time?\"\nAustin's heart cracked at those words. His knees felt weak.\nTears slid down his face as he leaned in, pressing his lips to her hand.\n\"Please don't say it like that, Val… it hurts,\" he whispered, his voice breaking.\nTears clouded her vision as she rested her forehead against his.\n\"I-I'm scared… but I don't want to stop you.\"\nThey had lost many people, and with this burden, Valerie knew her Lord wouldn't survive. Sebastian's death weighed on him for this long, and now he has lost his parents and sister too.\nShe didn't want him to live in pain for the rest of his life.\nThat was why, \"Please return in time...and make a peaceful world for me.\"\nShe added in a whisper, \"Won't you fulfill your wife's demand?\"\nAustin nodded, his hands trembling, \"I will. I promise.\"\nIt was a promise which he would fulfill at every cost. Even if no one stands beside him. Even if he has to face the Divine Beings. He would not stop until he had eradicated every demon.\n'You will pay the price of every tear she has shed today.'\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. Is there still anyone?",

      "content": "\"So, when is it going to happen?\" Valerie asked as they strolled through the market, each holding a crepe in hand.\nThe sun was already dipping low on the horizon. They'd been out since morning, enjoying their date to the fullest—visiting favorite spots, revisiting old memories, and collecting little souvenirs from different lands.\nNow, they were back in Eryndor—their childhood haunt, and the perfect place to end their day together.\nAustin let out a quiet sigh at her question. He hadn't wanted to talk about it during the date. But Valerie deserved an answer.\n\"After I defeat the last fragment of the Demon King,\" he finally said.\nValerie's brows knit together. \"You know you don't have to do that, right?\" she asked, giving him a sideways glance.\nHe nodded, then gently took her hand. \"It was just an excuse to spend more time with you,\" he admitted with a soft smile.\nHe knew killing Astaroth wouldn't change much once he turned back time.\nValerie looked ahead, her voice calm but firm. \"But it'll put you at a disadvantage. In more than one way.\"\nAustin stayed quiet. He'd thought about that too.\n\"First,\" she continued, \"you'll end up facing the Gods sooner than you planned. Once you wipe out the demon race, they'll have no reason to wait. And when you flip the hourglass to go back in time… they'll question you again.\"\nHe gave a slow nod. The Divine Ones weren't already happy about him using that skill. They had even tried to block the system from granting it to him.\n\"Second,\" she added, \"if you kill the last fragment, Astaroth will have more time to prepare for your return.\"\nAustin raised an eyebrow, silently asking her to explain.\n\"You said it yourself,\" Valerie went on, \"he keeps his memories from past timelines. So if he learns that you can destroy every part of him easily, he won't act out of rage next time. He'll plan. Smarter. Deadlier.\"\nShe was right.\nAstaroth and his generals—along with Selner—were the only ones who knew about the timeline where Austin had lost, where he'd been forced to split his soul into fragments to survive.\nIf Austin destroyed that final fragment now, Astaroth would stop acting on emotion. He'd get smarter. More careful. And far more dangerous.\nThat couldn't be allowed.\nBetter to leave him burning in fury. Better to let him believe he still had a chance.\nAustin let out a breath and gave a small nod. \"You're right, Valerie… I need to be smart about this.\"\nThey came to a slow pause as Austin turned toward her and asked, \"So you mean to say…That I should revert the time before Astaroth's arrival?\"\nValerie nodded with a calm demeanor, \"That would be for the best.\"\nThe blond one held her hand tenderly and asked, \"Then….I would need to do it in four days. Will that be enough? For you…and us?\" He wasn't sure. He wanted to spend more time with her…maybe an eternity.\nThe more time he stays with her the more he yearns for her.\nAnd the very thought that the next time he would see her, she would forget everything…terrifies him.\nValerie cupped his cheek as she said, \"Whatever happens, I will always be there for you. I promise.\"\nNo words were further shared as the two advanced toward the palace and stepped inside Austin's room.\nIt was the seventh time they were about to do it since last night—it was as if both of them were desperate for each other's warmth, and that can be seen in how eagerly they took each other's clothes off with their lips never parting.\nAustin gently led her to the bed and took a moment to look at her beautiful body.\n\"I know I have said this more than a hundred times but...you are beautiful.\"\nValerie shyly smiled, being complimented by him never fails to make her smile.\nShe raised her arms and asked him, \"Embrace me.\"\n.....\nThe next few days, Austin and Valerie spent all their time together.\nThey went on dates, ate together, took baths together, and naturally, slept together.\nThey were glued to each other both because they wanted to and also because Valerie wanted to live these moments to the fullest before the reset.\nOn the fourth day, Austin woke up earlier than usual.\nHe glanced at Valerie and found her looking back at him; her eyes half lidded.\n\"When did you wake up?\" He asked in a groggy voice as he moved her bangs to get a clear view of her calming eyes.\n\"Just now...\" She lied...actually, she was barely able to sleep last night.\nShe wanted to keep looking at him the whole night, knowing that today, it was going to happen.\nAustin fondly smiled at her as he gave her a soft peck and slowly rose from the bed.\n\"What do you want to eat? I will make it for you.\"\nHe asked as he put on his pants.\nValerie hummed in contemplation before asking, \"How about pancakes with maple syrup?\"\n\"Sweet things in the morning?\" Austin asked with his brows raised.\nValerie smiled, \"Yes...I want it.\"\nHe listened to her demand and started preparing what she asked for.\nThe room was huge, so he made a make-shift kitchen in the corner so he doesn't have to leave every time they get hungry.\nAs mentioned earlier, getting away even for minutes made them feel restless.\nAs Austin made the pancakes, Valerie rose from the bed and put on her nightdress.\n\"Austin,\" she softly called out, \"...can you do me a favor and tell my past self that you don't actually like Rhea? You see, for a few weeks, I always dreaded that you had a fight with her, and being with me was your way to get back at her.\"\nAustin blinked in surprise before turning towards her, \"Wait...you never told me that.\"\nValerie smiled apologetically, \"What can I say? Before you awakened your second fragment, you were all about Rhea. So I assumed that maybe...\"\nAustin sighed with a shake of his head, \"Initially you used to hide a lot of your feelings. But I can't blame you either. I always neglected you.\"\n\"Hmm...I was nervous that showing my real self might break the fragile connection we reestablished.\" Valerie added.\nAustin nodded, \"Okay, I will make sure you understand my feelings. Might as well kiss you on the spot before Rhea.\"\nValerie paused at that ...somehow hearing Austin kissing someone else, even if it was her past self, made her feel a sting in her chest.\nBut then she shook her head, \"What am I even thinking?\" She mumbled to herself.\nThey soon sat down at the table to eat breakfast. Not anything fancy, just sweet pancakes with bitter coffee.\nThe morning sunlight was flowing down the window, as they chatted while eating.\nNot so long after, they took a bath and changed into their casual clothes.\nFor the past ten days, Valerie had barely trained and she didn't feel guilty about it. For her, the war was over. All she had was this day now. So surely, she wasn't going to waste it in the gym.\nThey were walking in the garden of the palace. A few gardeners could be seen taking care of the plants.\nThere was no king of Erybdor and all the rulers of the seven nations were killed. So, at the moment, this world was actually free.\nAustin knew that the crime rate out there had elevated by a significant margin, but he couldn't do anything about it.\nToday, everything was about to change. The world order would return, so for these few moments, he left the world to live as it wanted.\nThey soon stopped before a fountain which was vivid in their memories.\n\"It was this place right...Where did I first meet you?\"Austin asked with a smile.\nValerie nodded, \"Yes...After being pushed away by other children, I was staring at my reflection when you approached me.\"\n\"Hmm...I wish I could see that small Valerie again. So adorable but cold.\"\nValerie smiled with a shake of her head but didn't say anything.\nThey soon fell silent. Their small fingers hooked.\n\"Valerie...\" He called out, \"...I love you.\"\nIt was strange that he wanted to say so many things but all he was able to convey was those three words.\nValerie turned to look at him, tears welling up in her eyes but a soft smile never leaving her face, \"You will get the response from my past self.\"\nAustin's shoulders dropped as he slowly nodded.\nFinally, he gave the command, \"System...imitate the spell: Divine Mockery.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Command Accepte-zznngh! The system has been blocked temporarily.]\n[Need a reboot]\n[Time required: 9 min 59 sec]\nAustin sighed.\nValerie had stopped moving. She was frozen before his eyes.\nThe world around him turned white.\nAnd from his left came an unfamiliar voice, \"You are one strange creature.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 293: Chapter 292- Let the battle begin\nThere were three of them.\nThe first, tall and stern, held a long spear wreathed in white flame.\nThe second, graceful and calm, wore a flowing cloak and carried a shining staff.\nThe third, fierce and bold, had wings of light and a blade that pulsed with thunder.\nTheir eyes glowed with divine power. A soft wind stirred around them as they stood—radiant, silent, and unshakable.\nAustin squinted slightly, shielding his gaze with a hand. \"Could you tone down the halo a bit? Hard to keep my eyes open.\"\nThe fierce one spoke, voice sharp like a crack of lightning. \"We have already lowered our presence, lest your fragile mind break under its weight.\"\nAustin smirked. \"Then maybe you shouldn’t have shown up at all if you were that worried.\"\nA moment of silence followed before the one with the spear stepped forward. \"Child... do you truly understand the weight of what you are about to begin?\"\nAustin gave a casual shrug. \"Of course I do. I’ll revive the Demon King. Every Demonic General. The Hellstains will crawl back to their places. And I’ll wipe them out again—one by one.\"\nHe had measured the risks. He knew the cost of summoning that dark power again. He knew what monsters he would bring back.\nBut that price was nothing—nothing compared to what he would gain.\nAll those they had lost—Sebastian, Rudolph, his and Valerie’s parents. Robert, the headmaster... every single one would return.\nAnd for that, Austin would bring Astaroth back at full strength, without hesitation.\nThe second one stepped forward, his voice heavy with command. \"The balance is steady. Let it remain, and we shall honor you. Reward you.\"\nAustin laughed, bitter and sharp. \"Balance? Astaroth lives, but he’s a shell of what he was. Humans breathe, but they’re scattered and dying. That’s your idea of balance?\"\nAny doubts he had about these so-called guardians vanished.\nThey were broken. Blind.\nThe spear-bearer’s eyes narrowed. \"This world cannot stand on one side alone. Light and darkness must both exist. One without the other cannot survive.\"\nAustin’s voice dropped, cold and resolute. \"I don’t accept your order. Your kind only knows how to watch from above while pretending to guide. You speak of balance—but you do nothing when people die in the name of it.\"\nHe took a step forward, fists clenched. \"You speak of darkness, but it’s you who allowed it to grow. Humans may be greedy, but they don’t butcher hundreds just to pass time.\"\nThere was no immediate reply.\nThen the fiery one spoke, his voice sharp and burning,\n\"But did we allow them to wipe you out?\"\nAustin let out a short, bitter laugh. \"Are you talking about what happened a thousand years ago? Do you really think humanity-or any race—wants to live as slaves again?\"\nThe god snickered, low and condescending.\n\"It is always the same. Supremacy lies with strength. The strong rule. The weak kneel.\"\nAustin didn’t hear it, but he could feel it—the unspoken words pressing against his mind. Just like you should kneel to us.\nCrossing his arms, Austin asked calmly, \"Then why step in now? I’m no immortal. I’m not building an empire. I just want a world where my people don’t have to live in fear.\"\nThe air thickened. Heat coiled around him, making his skin prickle.\nThe fiery one’s glow brightened, fierce and rising, like a sun beginning to burn too close. The ground beneath Austin trembled ever so slightly.\nHe was ready. The Absolute Barrier shimmered at the edge of activation. One wrong move, and it would erupt into place.\nBut then, the eldest among them spoke.\n\"Adénum. That is enough. Leave.\"\nThe command was simple—but it rang with authority so deep, it silenced the pressure in an instant. The weight pressing on Austin’s shoulders vanished like smoke.\nThe fiery one—Adénum—did not move at first. He stared at Austin, gaze sharp and unwavering. His wings flickered with restless energy.\nThen, without a word, his form dissolved into fragments of light—like embers blown from a dying fire.\nAnd he was gone.\nThe eldest one finally spoke, his voice deep and resounding like a distant bell.\n\"To tamper with the law that governs this world will cost you dearly, child. You would be wise to find contentment in what remains.\"\nAustin didn’t flinch. His response was immediate, firm.\n\"No. I don’t want this life.\"\nHis voice was steady—calm, but resolute.\n\"I’ve lost too many people. So either I die trying... or I change this present with my own hands.\"\nThere was no fear in him. No doubt.\nIf it meant defying gods to bring back those he loved—then so be it.\nThe one with the staff stepped forward, voice like a cold wind brushing across the soul.\n\"You intend to wipe out the demon race. But without them, this world will collapse into ruin. We have seen it.\"\nAustin let out a tired breath, his shoulders slightly sagging—not in defeat, but from the weight of all he carried.\n\"Even if I wanted to,\" he said slowly, \"I know I couldn’t erase every demon. That’s not my goal.\"\nHe looked up at them, eyes unwavering.\n\"I just need to destroy their King—and the ones strong enough to threaten my people. That’s all.\"\nA grave silence fell over the mountaintop.\nThey hadn’t expected that answer.\nAustin wasn’t aiming to wipe out the entire demon race. He only wanted the Demon King dead.\nAnd that, in itself, was a problem.\nAustin smirked, sensing the crack in their divine composure.\n\"What’s wrong? Don’t tell me you’re stuck. Can’t let Astaroth die... and no words left to sway me, either?\"\nHe was right—and they knew it.\nThe ancient pact still bound them. A vow etched in eternity: the Demon King must be protected.\nTo break it would be to risk everything.\nA dilemma only gods could suffer—and yet still be helpless before.\nThe eldest finally spoke, slow and weighty.\n\"You understand we will stop you... And yet you still choose this path?\"\nBefore Austin could reply, a ripple in the air shimmered beside him.\nA woman emerged from the shimmering, folded arms, sharp gaze.\nAn immortal. Calm, powerful. Dangerous.\nShe stood beside Austin as if she had always belonged there.\n\"And how exactly will you do that?\" she asked, her tone more curious than mocking.\nThe younger god growled low.\n\"Stay out of this, witch.\"\nShe didn’t even blink.\n\"Why should I? There is no place in this world I cannot stand.\"\nHer presence made the air still. Even the winds dared not stir around her.\nAustin tilted his head. \"I’m also curious. What’s your move, now?\"\nThe eldest god’s voice deepened.\n\"If the pact is broken, the cost will be catastrophic. We cannot allow you to destroy him.\"\nAustin’s lips curled slightly.\n\"Then try.\"\nHis voice was low, daring.\n\"But remember—opposing a Primordial Being... that’s not something you can afford.\"\nThat struck a chord.\nA flicker passed through the two radiant figures. Subtle. Barely a twitch. But Austin saw it.\nHe liked what he saw.\nThen, with a glare that could split stone, the younger god spoke:\n\"So be it. If this is the path you walk, then we will meet you in battle. You and your allies will fall before our vow.\"\nAustin’s eyes narrowed, jaw tightening.\nSo persistent. So blind.\nEven the calm one—the second—stepped forward now, his tone no longer neutral.\n\"The pact holds the life of our eldest as collateral. If we let you succeed... we lose him. So yes, we will fight.\"\nEven reason had given way to resolve.\nAustin remained silent, his stance unmoving. His next words would choose the battlefield.\n\"Well, since that’s what you have decided I can’t tell you to back off.\" With his eyes narrowed, he added, \"But you can’t stop me from flipping this world, can you?\"\nThe spear wielder’s hold around his weapon turned still as he asked, \"I am very curious to know who is the one granting you such...divine blessings.\"\nAustin smirked, \"So you can’t detect it, huh?\"\nHe was surprised, truthfully. The system was really overpowered that even the Gods could not detect her or stop her.\nIf they could they surely would have corrupted the system a long time ago and took all his blessings away.\n’Seriously, what kind of existence are you, system?’\nmaybe she was waiting to be asked, she notified him,\n[The system has been rebooted. Ready to initiate Divine Mockery!]\nAustin smirked at the two pigeons before him as he said, \"Okay then, see you in a few days...when Astaroth would be kneeling before him. I am very eager to see how you will protect him.\"\nThe two didn’t respond and soon they disappeared in blinding light.\nAustin sighed as he turned towards Valerie.\nThere were still ten seconds left.\nJust as she moved, Austin pulled her in a tight hug and called out,\n\"Whatever happens now, I promise I will protect you.\"\nValerie was startled but she soon responded to his hug and said, \"Mm...I will wait for you.\"\nAnd with that, the world was covered in a golden illumination.\nIt was time to rewrite a few things.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 294: Chapter 293- Restart\n\"Ah...\" Austin gasped as he sat up in bed, his breath shaky.\nFor a few seconds, he just sat there—eyes wide, chest heaving—until the heavy pressure on his body slowly began to lift.\n’System?’\n[We have successfully landed in the past. Congratulations, host!]\nThe system’s familiar tone echoed in his mind, but Austin barely registered the words.\nA smile crept onto his face as he stumbled toward the mirror. His fingers brushed against the edge, almost as if he needed to feel something solid. Something real.\nHe remembered the first time he woke up in this world. The very first thing he did was check his reflection.\nAnd there it was again.\nA slim, golden-haired young man stared back at him. The broad shoulders, the roughness in his skin—marks of years of relentless training—were gone.\nHe was...delicate again. Untouched by war. By loss. By regret.\n\"Haah... all those gains,\" he joked weakly to himself. But the smile faded as quickly as it came.\nHe turned toward the door, heart pounding. Each step forward felt like walking through a dream—no, a minefield. He feared what lay beyond it.\nWhat if this wasn’t real?\nWhat if the system had failed? What if some divine force had interfered? What if he had only imagined this chance?\nHis fingers hesitated on the doorknob—\nKnock\n\"Young master?\"\nAustin froze.\nThat voice...\nHe could never mistake it.\nClick\nThe door opened just a crack—but that was all he needed.\n\"Ah!\" Austin cried out and lunged forward, wrapping his arms tightly around the man before him.\nSebastian didn’t even have time to react. The old butler stumbled slightly under the sudden weight.\n\"Young master...? Is everything alright?\" he asked, worry evident in his voice. Austin’s shoulders were shaking.\n\"I...I...\" The words caught in his throat.\nHe thought he’d be calm. He thought he’d explain things with a smile, maybe tell a clever story to ease Sebastian into the truth.\nBut the moment he saw that familiar, wrinkled face, the months of sorrow and longing burst out of him like a dam breaking.\nSebastian didn’t press for answers. He simply held the trembling boy in his arms, gently rubbing his back.\n\"It’s alright,\" he whispered over and over, voice soft like a lullaby. \"Everything will be fine.\"\nIt took some time, but Austin eventually pulled away, eyes red but steady.\nHe looked up at the man who had always been by his side and asked quietly, \"When was the last time you got eight hours of sleep?\"\nSebastian blinked. \"Young master...?\"\n\"You need to rest more, Sebas.\" Austin gave a watery smile, wiping his tears with the back of his hand. \"But first... let’s go save Val.\"\nSebastian froze, his eyes wide. \"By Val... you don’t mean...\"\n\"Yes, Sebas,\" Austin said, his voice firm now. \"I mean my wife.\"\nHe stepped back and rested his hand on his shoulder with a confident smile. \"Now come on. We’ve got work to do.\"\nAustin stepped out of his room and paused.\nThe morning breeze greeted him, soft and cool against his skin. For a long moment, he stood still, letting his eyes wander over the sight before him—the academy, whole and unbroken.\nAfter the demon’s attack in his previous life, most of the buildings had been reduced to ruins. No one had ever bothered rebuilding. It had become a graveyard of memories.\nBut now...\nBathed in pale moonlight, the academy stood tall again. Majestic. Peaceful.\nHis chest tightened—not from sorrow, but a deep, aching peace.\n\"Are you sure you’re alright, young master?\" Sebastian asked quietly.\nAustin nodded, his voice calm. \"Better than ever. Just had a bad dream, that’s all... Makes you appreciate things more, you know?\"\nHe didn’t want to lie. Eventually, he would tell Sebastian everything. But not now. Not today. Today was for reclaiming the future.\nThey walked together, making their way past the familiar pathways and gardens, eventually stepping out of the male dormitory. In the distance, the tall arches of the main building loomed—where the trial was being held.\nJust as they reached the entrance, Sebastian called out.\n\"Young master...\"\nAustin paused and turned slightly, humming in acknowledgment.\nSebastian hesitated before adding, \"I know how things might seem right now, but... please believe me—Lady Valerie isn’t the kind of person who would try to hurt someone over a personal offense. That’s not who she is.\"\nAustin stared at the old man for a beat, eyes softening.\nSebastian had always known Valerie’s feelings—how much she cared for Austin, how much she endured silently. And he had hoped, perhaps quietly prayed, that one day Austin would see it too.\nBut Austin had been too consumed by resentment to listen back then.\nNow, things were different.\n\"I’ve got this,\" Austin said gently, his voice filled with quiet assurance.\nHe stepped forward and pushed open the door.\nInside, just as he expected, were seven people seated in judgment.\nAnd among them—Valerie.\nHis eyes found her instantly.\nShe wasn’t angry. She wasn’t broken.\nShe was... shocked.\nBack then, she had already accepted her fate. She had lost hope.\nBut now—she looked as if something impossible had just happened.\nHer eyes trembled as they locked with his.\n\"There you are,\" the Headmaster said, his voice calm and firm.\nAustin tore his gaze away from Valerie and looked across the room.\nStanding beside Rhea was his old friend.\nSeeing him—alive, well—brought a smile to Austin’s face before he could stop it.\n\"What’s so funny?\" snapped Parkinson, clearly irritated.\nAustin turned toward him with the faintest grin. \"Nothing. Just feeling lucky, that’s all.\"\nWith calm, confident steps, Austin walked to the center of the room and stood before the Headmaster.\n\"I believe I have a better solution,\" he said, voice steady. \"One that doesn’t involve dragging this through a full trial.\"\nPhilius blinked, caught off guard. \"What do you mean?\"\nAustin turned his gaze to Rhea, his expression unreadable.\n\"If Valerie apologizes for damaging your Shard, and agrees to stay away from you... Will that be enough for you to drop the complaint?\"\nThe room fell into stunned silence.\nEven the air seemed to be still.\nValerie... apologize to Rhea?\nEveryone knew the animosity between them—especially Valerie’s. The idea felt unthinkable.\nParkinson shot to his feet, voice sharp with outrage. \"She nearly killed her, and you think—\"\n\"I accept,\" Rhea interrupted, her tone calm but laced with surprise. \"If she promises to stay away from me, I’ll withdraw the complaint.\"\nAustin exhaled a small breath of relief. \"Thank you, Rhea.\"\nWithout waiting, he stepped toward Valerie and gently took her hand.\nThe room tensed.\nEven Rhea’s frown deepened, her arms crossing, but she said nothing.\n\"Val...\" he said softly.\nShe looked up at him, startled. Her eyes, wide and unsure, searched his face.\nHe knew why she was surprised. It was the first time in so long that he spoke to her like this—gently, without bitterness.\nShe didn’t understand it. She couldn’t.\nBut even in her confusion, she didn’t pull away.\nInstead, she slowly turned to face Rhea.\nAnd then, with a small but graceful bow, she said, \"I’m sorry for what happened. Let’s keep our distance from now on.\"\nHer voice was quiet, but steady.\nRhea blinked.\nShe had expected the apology—Austin had arranged the terms after all—but hearing those words from Valerie’s lips, from someone who had always looked at her with scorn, still caught her off guard.\nShe remained silent.\nAustin gave her a nod before turning back to the Headmaster. \"That settles it, doesn’t it? Can we leave now, sir?\"\nPhilius looked at them, then at the Vice-headmaster. There was nothing more to say.\n\"Yes,\" he said slowly. \"You may go.\"\n\"One moment, sir,\" came a sharp interruption.\nIt was the bespectacled Professor Morkel. He adjusted his glasses, his tone crisp with disapproval. \"If we let her walk away now, we set a dangerous precedent. Students might believe that even nearly killing someone can be brushed aside with a few soft words.\"\nThe intent behind his words was clear.\nHe wanted Valerie punished.\nParkinson, standing beside him, gave a nod of agreement, arms crossed and expression stern.\nBut Austin didn’t flinch. He wasn’t upset. If anything, their resistance only deepened his sense of peace.\nHe was too happy to let their bitterness reach him.\n\"Professor Morkel,\" Austin began, his voice calm but firm, \"if Valerie truly intended to kill Rhea, she could have. Easily. And Rhea knows that better than anyone.\"\nHe turned slightly, meeting Rhea’s gaze. \"But it was a moment of impulse. The moment she realized what she was doing... she stopped. She backed off. Isn’t that right?\"\nRhea’s jaw clenched. Her hands curled into fists at her sides.\nAfter a moment, she said tightly, \"Professor... It’s fine. Let it go.\"\nMorkel scowled at the Prince but offered no reply.\nThe matter was done.\nAs Austin and Valerie stepped out of the building, the air felt lighter. Brighter. The warm breeze carried the scent of the garden flowers, and the two walked side by side in silence for a while.\nAustin’s mind stirred with thoughts.\nShould he tell her the same story again? That he had been wrong? Did he remember what they had, what he lost?\nOr... should he walk a new path?\nHe was still lost in thought when he heard a soft voice beside him.\n\"Austin...\"\nHe stopped.\nHer head was lowered, hair falling slightly over her face. She slowly lifted her hand and extended it toward him.\n\"My finger feels lonely,\" she whispered. \"Will you place another beautiful ring there... just like before?\"\nAustin froze.\nHis heart stuttered, and his eyes widened.\n\"V-Val...?\"\nShe looked up at him—and in her eyes, he saw the tears. But he also saw the truth.\nHer voice trembled as she nodded. \"Yes... I remember it. Everything.\"\nTime seemed to stand still around them.\nThe garden. The wind. The world.\nOnly the two of them remained, standing together.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Mostly slice of life with family, friends and of course his wife. Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 295: Chapter 294- Same path\nWalking on the sand with her hands crossed behind her back was the same woman who stood beside Austin when he faced the Gods. The same person who gave him the courage to look them in the eyes and declare his decision.\n\"This isn’t such a bad experience after all...\" Selner murmured to herself, a soft smile on her lips.\nShe felt light—almost free. But the moment her sister’s words came back to her, her heart sank a little.\nIt was the first time they had scolded her... the first time she saw that kind of anger in their eyes.\nThen again, she had broken the law once more. But she didn’t regret it. Not even a little.\n\"Hmmmmhmm...\" She hummed quietly, walking along the shore as the water gently brushed her feet.\nThe breeze was very comfortable and for the first time, she experienced this calming sensation.\nAnd then—\n\"I...can’t believe what you did.\"\nShe didn’t need to turn around. She knew who it was.\nWith a small smile, she said, \"Well, didn’t you see this coming?\" She kept walking—until a hand gently caught her arm.\nSelner finally turned to look at him over her shoulder.\nThere he stood, the only human that has stirred so many emotions in her heart.\nWith his eyes filled with concern, he asked,\n\"You broke the law again by sending Valerie back in time... and now you’re being punished for it,\" he said in a tight voice.\nHe could feel it. She wasn’t a witch anymore. The overwhelming mana that once cloaked her was gone. Now, she felt like an ordinary mage—so much weaker than before.\nSelner sighed, turned toward him, and gently took his hands.\n\"Sorry... I was stalking you,\" she admitted with a light smile. \"Those few days after you told Valerie only you would go back in time... I watched you. I saw you crying beside her while she slept. I saw how you gathered every little thing that reminded you of your time together. I was there, Austin. Every moment.\"\nHer voice softened with a sad smile. \"And you think I could just watch and do nothing... seeing the man I love like that?\"\nAustin lowered his head, squeezing her hands.\n\"But why do you always have to pay the price for me?\"\nShe had already risked everything once, helping him scatter his soul fragments across different vessels. And now... she had been punished again—for him.\nSelner smiled gently, cupping his cheek.\n\"Because you helped me see that this world isn’t just about power and greed. That there’s room for love... and even sorrow. You gave me feelings I once thought were useless.\"\n\"I’m just returning the favor,\" she added softly.\nAustin didn’t know how to feel.\nSelner had always given without asking for anything in return. She had stayed by his side, always protecting and supporting him. Always selfless.\n\"You know... once Astaroth finds out you’ve been punished, he’ll come after you himself, right?\"\nSelner nodded. \"Well, he’s only second on the list of people who hate me most.\"\nAustin raised a brow. \"Who’s first?\"\n\"Your wife.\"\nAustin chuckled and shook his head. \"Come with me.\"\nSelner blinked. \"What?\"\n\"You gave up your powers—at least for now—so it’s my job to protect you until they return.\"\n\"You don’t need to. I made this choice,\" she insisted.\n\"Selner.\" His gaze turned serious.\nShe fell quiet.\n....\n\"...So, you really requested this room for her, huh?\" Valerie said, her elbow resting on her knee, chin cradled in her palm.\nAustin gave a sheepish smile. \"I should’ve told you earlier.\"\nValerie let out a soft sigh as she stood. \"I’m not angry. Really. All I want to say is... thank you, Selner.\" She gave a polite bow.\nSelner looked slightly flustered. \"It’s fine. You’re my student... It’s the least I can do.\"\nValerie raised an eyebrow and smirked as she leaned in close to whisper, \"Don’t give me that. I know you brought me back because of my Lord, didn’t you?\"\nSelner didn’t respond—just turned her eyes away, clearly caught.\nValerie chuckled. \"So you’re staying close to her for the time being?\"\nAustin nodded with a hum. \"Her punishment will last ten years... until then, we’ll protect her.\"\nValerie said nothing more—no teasing, no sharp remarks. How could she be jealous of the woman who had stood by Austin through everything, who’d even helped bring them back together?\nShe simply smiled.\nThen, after a moment of silence—\n\"Umm... do you have anything to eat?\" Selner asked, clearly a little embarrassed.\nMana was no longer enough. She needed real food now.\nAustin’s face lit up with a grin. \"I’ll cook something for us.\"\n....\nFar away, deep within the night, the only one of the Generals currently awake and mobile was the Succubus Queen.\nRight now, she was moving quickly toward her Lord’s palace, her steps filled with urgency.\nThe last thing she remembered was being ensnared by that cursed hoe... and then—darkness. Complete, suffocating silence.\nAnd now? She was back. Back in time. Back in this world.\n\"Someone reset the world again...\" she muttered under her breath, eyes narrowed. \"But who?\"\nIt couldn’t be Selner. Not after what happened last time. No... she doubted Selner would dare to repeat that mistake.\nThen who?\nAnd how?\nSoon, she entered the demon Lord’s palace and found the familiar woman with dark hair standing near the entrance\nAmenytr—Astaroth’s only daughter.\n\"I was about to reach out to you,\" she called out.\nThe Demon General asked, \"What about my Lord?\"\n\"He is in the recovery tube. Still too weak to move.\"\nWith her gaze hardening, Amenytr said, \"Since you are here, let’s go and slaughter that bastard.\" She possessed the memories of her previous life. That’s why, she knew that Austin wouldn’t be able to withstand the forces of a Demon General.\nIt would be the best gift Amenytr could present to her father before his awakening.\nHowever, \"You really think we can behead him just like that?\" The Sucubuss Queen asked with a stiff expression, \"...he has grown too strong for just the two of us.\"\nAmenytr frowned, but before she could have asked anything, the other one filled in, \"He has already gained the third fragment...with such control over Scar...we can’t fight him as we are now.\"\n\"Even not with the help of my brother?\"\nThe General made it clear, \"Unless all four Generals fight him together with their forces, winning against him isn’t an option.\" She was angered, true. But she couldn’t be deluded and charge blindly again.\n\"Then what should we do?\" Asked the younger one.\nA brief silence before the General said, \"For now, we must keep an eye on those who are close to Austin. And when the time comes...\"\nShe didn’t need to say.\nShe was going to follow the same plan as the last time.\nShe was going to mentally crush him, torture him until he falls on his knees and begs for his death.\n.....\n\"Don’t you think Austin’s been acting strange lately?\" Parkinson asked as he sat down, Rhea beside him on the left.\nRudolph was off to the side, finishing his warm-up for an upcoming spar. Rhea would be his opponent—but she’d already had a solid match with Parkinson to get ready.\nAt Park’s words, Rhea gave a quiet hum of agreement. \"True...\"\nShe paused for a moment.\nAustin had been sticking close to Valerie lately—more than usual. And for some reason... it made her chest feel heavy.\nEvery time she saw them together, laughing or talking so closely... it felt like betrayal.\nBut that didn’t make sense.\nWhy does it feel like this?\nWhy does it hurt?\nShe didn’t have the answer. Only the ache in her heart grew a little stronger each time she looked at him.\n\"Maybe it’s just guilt?\" Rhea muttered under her breath.\nParkinson heaved a sigh, \"Well, I am glad she is staying away from you. She is a very nasty girl, I must say. I mean, I have also grown up among nobles but I can never act like her.\"\nRhea wryly smiled. The truth is...it isn’t like solely Valerie is at fault.\nShe has pushed her a few times as well.\n\"Are you ready?\" Rudolph asked as he finally stopped stretching and stood before the two.\nRhea nodded as she got up.\nShe summoned her sword, which had grown back to its full length.\nShe was healed by the medic, and a few days of rest were needed for her to get back on her feet.\nHowever, just as she was about to step onto the arena,\n\"Mind going for a round with me, Rud?\"\nA clear voice came from behind as everyone turned to look at the duo.\nIt was Austin and Valerie.\nRudolph snickered, \"You sure? You might not be able to attend a few classes today.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Well, l won’t blame you if you break a few bones.\"\nHe seemed not even a bit offended as he stood before his old friend.\nRudolph was surprised to see such confidence from him.\nHowever, he wasn’t the kind of guy who would back off from a challenge, \"Then so be it.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Parkinson could tell—something was different about Austin.\nJust a few days ago, the guy barely spoke to anyone aside from Rhea. He never really fit in the Apex Circle, and sparring against classmates had always ended in disaster for him. Every match had been a blow to his pride, a reminder of where he stood.\nBut now? He was challenging Rudolph—the second strongest student in the class.\nEither Austin had gone completely insane... or he was trying to impress someone.\nRhea, maybe?\nOr was it Valerie now?\nParkinson's gaze shifted to the violet-haired girl standing quietly near the edge of the arena.\nThere was something different about her too.\nHer cold, distant mask was gone. No more biting looks or dismissive expressions. She stood there with a soft smile, her eyes fixed only on one person—Austin.\nNo hostility. No arrogance. Just... warmth.\nWhat a strange but welcoming change, Parkinson thought.\nBack in the arena, Austin and Rudolph were getting ready.\nA few students had already gathered around, and those who were about to leave stopped in their tracks. After all, who would miss the chance to see a noble humiliate himself?\nA quiet buzz filled the area as the crowd slowly grew.\nAustin didn't care.\nHe hadn't come here to win the crowd or stroke his pride. That wasn't who he was. He wasn't here to prove a point. He knew exactly where he stood when compared to Rudolph.\nBut he had something else in mind.\nAustin just wanted to relive the old days.\n\"Ready?\" he asked calmly.\nRudolph raised an eyebrow. \"Not summoning your Shard?\"\nDespite the question, he didn't summon his own either.\nAustin shrugged. \"It won't be necessary.\"\nRudolph's eyes narrowed. \"Hoh~ It's been a while since I saw that look of cockiness in your eyes.\"\nAustin smirked. \"And you're still as arrogant as ever.\"\nRudolph gave a small shrug. \"I have the strength to back my arrogance.\"\nAustin shifted into a battle stance, eyes steady.\n\"Let's see if you can stand by those words.\"\nNo more words were spoken.\nA brief silence hung in the air—then both of them moved.\nBut Rudolph suddenly froze mid-step, throwing his arms up to guard his neck.\nAustin came to a halt too, confusion flickering in his eyes. \"What happened?\"\nRudolph's face turned slightly pale. He slowly touched his neck, as if confirming something.\nThe crowd around them stirred, murmurs spreading. No one had expected that kind of reaction from someone like Rudolph.\nRudolph couldn't explain what he just felt. It was the first time. He felt as if...he was going to get killed if he drew any closer to his opponent. As if, something was warning him to take his steps cautiously.\nBut then Rudolph shook his head, trying to brush it off. \"Nothing... Let's go.\"\nHe was the first to charge this time—clearly no longer holding back.\nWith a burst of speed, he leapt forward and raised his knee, aiming to drive it straight into Austin's gut.\nBut the blonde was ready.\nHe blocked the strike, used the force to push himself upward—and landed a sharp knee right into Rudolph's chin.\nCrack!\nThe bigger man staggered back, teeth clenched, eyes blinking in surprise.\nGasps echoed around the arena.\n\"Woah...\"\n\"I didn't even see that.\"\n\"Wait... isn't that Austin? The loser from the best class?\"\nRhea's brows knitted as she stepped forward, worry creeping into her voice. \"Rudolph... are you alright?\"\nRudolph rubbed his chin, then let out a short chuckle. A grin stretched across his face.\n\"Never thought you'd be the one holding back in a fight with me.\"\nAustin shrugged. \"Time changes, Rud. Gotta adapt.\"\nRudolph let out a laugh. \"Then so be it. I'll go all in too.\"\nAustin growled, cracking his neck. \"That's what I want.\"\nAnother brief pause.\nThen—it began.\nThe students watched in awe as the two second-year students clashed.\nTheir movements were a blur to most. But not to Rhea, Parkinson, or Valerie—they could follow every step, every blow, every shift in balance.\n\"...The fuck? Rudolph can't even land a hit,\" Parkinson muttered, disbelief coloring his voice.\nRhea was too stunned to speak.\nValerie, on the other hand, simply smiled—watching her Lord move freely, his steps filled with life again. It had been too long since he looked like he was enjoying himself.\n\"Damn you!\" Rudolph shouted, frustration spilling from his voice.\nHe twisted on his toes, pulling his fist back with a sharp breath. His muscles swelled as he hurled everything into one punch.\nBut Austin was already gone.\nA quick sidestep—smooth, effortless—and before Rudolph could adjust, Austin drove his fist into his gut.\nDHAK\nThe impact rang through the gym like a hammer strike.\nAir escaped from Rudolph's lungs in a ragged gasp, his eyes wide.\nFor a split second, all he saw was white.\nHe stumbled back and dropped to his knees, one hand clutched to his stomach, his breath ragged.\nThe crowd fell silent.\nAustin lowered his arm and asked, \"You good, mate?\"\nFor a few moments, Rudolph didn't say anything.\nBut then he straightened his posture and asked in all seriousness, \"Tell me you were pretending to be weak until now.\"\nAustin's brows elevated, \"You seem angry.\"\n\"Of course I would be! If I knew I had such a strong competition in the face of my friend, why would I have searched for people all around?\"\nAustin chuckled, \"So you are not angry about your loss.\"\n\"Whining over loss is something a loser would do. I am already thinking when I can fight you again.\"\n....something only Rudolph could say.\nAustin suddenly felt his heart turning heavy.\nHe missed this. His stupid, knucklehead friend.\n\"Challenge me anytime you want.\"\n....\nAfter the spar, Austin returned to his room with Valerie quietly walking beside him.\nShe hadn't said a word since they left the gym, and that silence felt... unusual.\n\"Is there something you want to say?\" he asked gently. He didn't need to remind her that she could always speak her mind.\nValerie hesitated, then softly asked, \"Umm... can we spar sometime? Not now, but maybe in the evening?\"\nAustin chuckled. \"Of course. But why the hesitation?\"\nShe looked down, fidgeting with her fingers. \"I mean... with how strong you are now, the only ones who could challenge you are William or Olivia. Sparring with me would just be a waste of your time.\"\nAustin slowed to a stop and turned toward her.\nHis lips didn't curve into a smile—but his eyes did.\n\"When I was just a D-rank,\" he said, \"barely able to control my Shard, I used to spar with you—an S-rank. Did you ever feel like you were wasting your time on me?\"\nValerie instantly shook her head.\n\"Then there's your answer.\" He leaned in and gently kissed her forehead. \"No matter how much we change, nothing between us changes. Don't ever forget that.\"\n\"Mm-hmm.\" She nodded, cheeks slightly pink, a quiet warmth blooming in her chest.\nSoon, they reached the dormitory—Valerie easily dodging the warden as they advanced towards his room.\nValerie felt strangely elated whenever she snuck to his room. It gave her a gentle reminder that they were back in time.\nHowever, the moment they stepped inside, they froze.\n\"Hello...\" Greeted the familiar violet-haired woman who was currently tied to the chair.\nStanding before her was Sebastian who looked at Austin in surprise, \"You know her, young master.\"\nAustin wryly smiled...he should have introduced them to each other\n\"You didn't even try to defend yourself?\" Austin asked as he untied the woman by running his finger down the ropes.\nThe room looks untidy, so definitely no battle was fought here.\n\"I know what he means to you...that's why I didn't want to hurt him.\"\nA small part of Sebastian's pride was hurt.\nBut he didn't focus on that and asked his master, \"Sir, don't tell me that only after a few days of realising your feelings for Miss Valerie you found another woman.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Sebas...you really want this room to turn into a cold storage, no?\"\nThe old man glanced at the girl beside him and her expression told him to remain silent for the time being.\nSoon, Selner got up and introduced herself, \"I am a good friend of Austin and Valerie's teacher. Nice to meet you, sir Sebastian.\"\n\"Ah, hello Miss Selner. I apologize for my rude behavior.\" He also gave a bow.\nAustin told his butler, \"She will be staying in the room next to mine. She is a dear friend, Sebas. So please look after her as you do for me.\"\nSebastian nodded, \"Understood.\"\nOnce done with that, Austin asked, \"So...I was thinking, how about we go and meet him?\"\nSelner sighed and shook her head.\nSebastian and Valerie seemed confused as the latter asked, \"Who?\"\nAustin grinned, \"My dear elder brother, Adrian?\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- If you have been with me this far, please make sure to leave a review for future readers.

      "content": "Austin was attending another funeral.\nEven though he had returned in time, he still couldn't protect someone close to him.\nBut this time… he didn't feel sad—at least not on the inside, no matter what his face showed.\nHe stood quietly beside his parents. His sister was off to the side, while Valerie stood a short distance away with her own family.\nThe wind was strong today, tugging at their clothes as the priest recited blessings for Aiden's soul, wishing him peace in the afterlife.\nAiden had tried to flee the capital after his crimes were uncovered. He was involved in slave smuggling… and had bribed several spies to keep tabs on ministers—and even on his own parents.\nThe truth came out unexpectedly, as if by chance. When Aiden ran, he was killed by an S-rank beast that appeared out of nowhere.\nOf course, that 'chance' was carefully planned.\nAustin had pulled all the strings. He had set everything in motion—quietly, from the shadows. Valerie was the only one who knew.\nHe didn't want to be seen as a villain who killed his own brother without a trial. So he did what he had to do… in silence.\nAnd now, when it was time to cry, he showed up like the grieving brother.\nSniff… sniff…\nHearing his mother sob, Austin gently placed a hand on her shoulder.\nThe moment she felt his touch, she turned and buried her face in his chest, crying loudly.\nHe softly rubbed her back. \"It's okay, Mom. He's in a better place now.\"\nHe no longer saw her as the mother he once knew. He had long forgiven her.\nWhat mattered now was giving her, his father, and everyone he cared about… a better life.\nCedric walked over and let out a quiet sigh before placing a comforting hand on Austin's shoulder.\nValerie felt warm in her chest seeing the family of four together.\nThat day...when she woke up, she asked Selner how her Lord was after seeing her parents die.\nHer answer was straightforward,\n'It was better that you were unconscious at that time...' The look in her eyes said it all.\nHer Lord must have been devastated. Seeing her parents dying before his eyes.\nDespite what had happened, she knew deep down he loved both of them.\nAnd now...she was glad that they had come back.\n\"Valerie,\" her mother softly called out, \"How are things between you two?\"\nOh right, they still think that Austin was still neglecting her.\nShe fondly smiled as she said, \"Why don't you find out yourself? He will be coming over for a few days.\"\nHer father hummed in confusion, \"So suddenly? Is everything alright?\"\nValerie wanted to say, 'Because he wants to spend time with you two,' but that would have sounded strange. So,\n\"He has a few days off. And since I wanted to stay with you two, he said he would come along.\"\nHer mother seemed surprised, \"Since when did he become so attached to you?\"\nValerie exhaled a brief sigh of contentment, \"You will be surprised to see the new him, Mother.\"\n.....\n[A few days later]\n\"It's... strange, isn't it?\" Sophia spoke softly, her gaze fixed on Cedric as he sliced the meat into neat, bite-sized pieces.\n\"What is?\" the King asked without looking up.\nWith a wistful smile, the Queen said, \"Despite how I treated him... Austin forgave me instantly.\"\nCedric sighed, setting down his utensils.\n\"Dear, you were under Aiden's spell. You can't blame yourself.\"\n\"But still...\" Sophia's voice trembled. \"The spell wouldn't have worked if I didn't already believe that Austin had taken most of our affection… and that Aiden deserved more attention.\"\nCedric reached across the table and gently held her hand.\n\"You were trying to fill the void in Aiden's heart. That's not something to feel guilty about. You wanted to give love where it was missing. That's not a crime.\"\nSophia leaned back, her head bowed. \"But... is it really okay? For Austin to forgive me just like that? What if he's just forcing himself?\"\n\"No, I'm not.\"\nThe voice made both parents turn.\nAustin was approaching the table, gently pulling a reluctant Averis behind him by the hand.\nOver the past few days, he had spent most of his time with his sister, slowly coaxing her out of her shell. And today, finally, he had succeeded in getting her out of her room.\nPulling out a chair, he gestured.\n\"Come on, sit.\"\nAveris scowled, \"Why must I be dragged out like this?\"\nAustin smiled.\n\"Because your brother feels lonely without his Avy.\"\nHer scowl faltered.\nLooking away, her ears flushed red as she quietly took the seat beside him.\nAustin sat down next to her and turned to his mother.\n\"I don't want to dwell on the past and let it build walls between us. I've made my share of mistakes too… hurt people who cared about me. And if they can forgive me, then I can forgive you too.\"\nSophia's eyes welled up with tears. She lowered her gaze.\n\"Thank you… son.\"\nDinner continued mostly in silence. Only Cedric and Austin spoke occasionally. Averis was still too stunned by the shift in atmosphere.\nAustin had been... acting different.\nApologizing to her. Forgiving their mother. Dragging her out of that dark room she'd locked herself in.\nWhat happened to him? the silver-haired girl wondered, glancing at the boy beside her.\nAfter the meal, Cedric stood and smiled at his son.\n\"Care for a walk?\"\nNaturally, Austin nodded.\nThey walked in silence.\nCedric kept his hands clasped behind his back, his steps measured and calm.\nAustin, walking beside him, waited patiently for the older man to speak first. And soon, he did.\n\"Are you okay, son?\"\nAustin didn't hesitate. \"Yes. Absolutely.\"\nBut Cedric sighed softly. \"I'm not asking this in regards to your mother.\" His gaze shifted toward Austin, eyes filled with concern. \"When you came to us… your mother and I both saw it. You were about to cry. That's why I'm asking.\"\nHe stopped walking and turned to face him, his voice gentler now.\n\"Are you really okay, Austin?\"\nFor a moment, Austin just stared at his father, tempted to offer another easy lie.\nBut then, he said quietly, \"It was a long journey, Father. I can't tell you where I was… but it was painful. Deeply painful.\"\nCedric didn't need to hear the details to understand.\nHe could feel it—the weight Austin carried. The silent wounds left behind.\nHe could see the change, too. The boy who had left them wasn't the same one who had returned. There was something older behind those eyes, something hardened.\nHe had even asked Sebastian, hoping the butler might shed some light on what had happened. But Sebastian knew nothing either.\nStill, Cedric didn't press.\nIf the day came when Austin wanted to share, he would listen. Until then...\n*Pull*\n\"You did well, son.\" Cedric wrapped his arms around him, pulling him into a firm, quiet embrace. His hand gently patted his back.\nAustin's eyes widened slightly in surprise.\nBut in the comfort of that familiar warmth, he allowed himself to soften, his shoulders relaxing as he mumbled under his breath,\n\"...I'm back.\"\n...\n\"You're leaving already?\" Sophia asked, watching her son cook pancakes in the royal kitchen.\nThe maids hovered nearby, visibly uneasy—unsure whether to intervene or step away. After all, it wasn't every day royalty handled breakfast.\nBut Austin had made himself clear.\nHe wanted to cook for his family—personally.\nWith no other choice, the staff quietly stepped back.\n\"Yes, Mother,\" Austin replied, flipping a pancake with practiced ease.\n\"...I miss Valerie. And I also need to visit her parents. I want to assure them that everything is good between us.\"\nSophia let out a soft sigh.\n\"That's something you should absolutely do. When Anastasia visited last time, I could hear the concern in her voice. She's worried about Valerie.\"\nAustin didn't respond with words. He simply hummed in quiet agreement.\nThere was a pause, and then Sophia spoke again, hesitant.\n\"Um, Austin… with everything that's happened, we never got a chance to celebrate your birthday. Would it be possible… for you to come back after visiting Valerie's parents? Maybe then, we could do something?\"\nAustin sighed, placing the spatula down for a moment.\n\"Ma, you know I don't need a celebration. And with Aiden's recent passing… it would feel inappropriate. The people don't know what he was doing behind the scenes. To them, he died a prince. So yes, celebrating anything might come across as... insensitive.\"\nSophia looked down, her expression dimming.\n\"I just thought… maybe...\"\nAustin stepped toward her and gently cupped her cheek, lifting her gaze.\n\"Dear Mother,\" he said with a soft smile,\n\"What I cherish more than any celebration… is having the people I love close to me. So how about we keep it simple? Just a small gathering, just us?\"\nHer eyes glistened as she nodded.\n\"Yes… that would be more than enough.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Chapter 298: Chapter 297- Council\n\"It’s strange, isn’t it?\" said one of the two Council Heads as they walked side by side toward the conference hall.\n\"You mean the silence? It is,\" the other replied, his thick moustache twitching as he spoke.\n\"I mean, for the past few days, every demon sighting has been taken care of before our strike teams even arrive. Just yesterday, a Hellstain erupted in a major town—yet before Warrior Olivia reached the site, it had already vanished.\" The woman’s tone carried amazement as she recited the latest report.\n\"Do you think it could be William?\" the man asked curiously.\nThe woman scoffed. \"That man doesn’t lift a finger unless pushed. Forget demon hunting—he wouldn’t even go on a walk without being ordered.\"\n\"You’re right. The Council only keeps him around for emergencies. Then who...\" The man lowered his voice, glancing around. \"Who is out there in the shadows, cleaning up before we even arrive?\"\nIt was a valid concern. Someone—or something—with enough power to erase threats before they escalated. So far, this presence had only helped them. But power that acted unseen could easily shift from helpful to dangerous. Especially if it didn’t answer to anyone.\nMoments later, the two entered the grand conference hall, where the other eleven Council Heads were already gathered. Without a word, they took their seats as the meeting began.\n\"We are gathered today to address the growing number of demon sightings across multiple nations—particularly concentrated in the northern region,\" the lead speaker announced.\nAfter a pause, someone asked, \"Is there a pattern? Any specific nation or town being targeted?\"\nAn analyst stood and answered, \"Yes, Sir. Most sightings are clustering around Eryndor.\"\n\"Eryndor?\" one of the council heads scoffed. \"What do those mindless beasts stand to gain there? That country has nothing of value left.\"\nEryndor’s condition was grim. The nation had already suffered great losses in past wars and was barely standing, constantly strained by its long-standing feud with Drenovar.\n\"Still...\" the analyst continued, \"Eryndor sits at the center of the continent. Its location alone makes this no coincidence. These sightings are too frequent and too specific. It’s deliberate. The demons are targeting them.\"\nIf Drenovar—or even the Council’s own forces near the Sea of Separation—were attacked, it would’ve made some sense. But Eryndor?\nA heavy silence settled over the hall. Each head weighed the possibilities, the implications.\nThen, someone spoke.\n\"...What if it’s because of the warrior working from the shadows?\"\nAll eyes turned to the speaker.\n\"We haven’t figured out who this anomaly is—the one who’s been clearing demon threats before anyone else arrives. But maybe we’ve been thinking about it the wrong way,\" he said. \"Maybe these demons are not just random threats. Maybe they’re being drawn out by this person. Maybe... they’re appearing because of the warrior.\"\nThe room fell into silence at the assumption.\nNot so long after a person asked, \"Does anyone have any idea who this person could be?\"\nThe analyst responded, \"Uh...have we forgotten about the S-rank warrior whom we have been trying to recruit for a long time?\"\n\"....!\" Many eyes widened as they nearly forgot about her.\nSoon, a council head demanded, \"We must send someone and investigate this.\"\n•••••••\n\"Valerie?!\" Anastasia called out, rushing toward her daughter as she spotted her near the hallway.\n\"Mom?\" Valerie turned, frowning slightly at her mother’s panicked expression. \"What’s wrong?\"\nAnastasia looked genuinely shaken. \"I—I just saw someone who looked exactly like Austin in the kitchen!\"\nValerie couldn’t help but let out a small laugh. \"That’s because it is Austin, Mom. He’s not a clone.\" She gave a teasing smile. \"Your son-in-law wanted to prepare breakfast for us today.\"\nAnastasia blinked. \"Wait, does he usually cook for people?\"\nValerie shook her head. \"Only for the ones he wants to impress.\"\nThat made Anastasia pause, the tension in her face softening just a bit. She opened her mouth to say something but was cut off by her daughter gently pushing her toward the hallway.\n\"Go freshen up, Mom. He’s just trying to make a good impression.\"\nAnastasia still seemed a little overwhelmed but eventually gave a slow nod and walked off.\nValerie turned and made her way toward the kitchen.\nShe found Austin already at work, moving around the space with focus—stirring, slicing, and keeping an eye on the stovetop like a seasoned chef.\nWithout saying a word, she stepped up behind him and gently wrapped her arms around his waist.\n\"Morning,\" he said with a soft smile, still facing the stove. \"Did you sleep well?\"\n\"Mmhmm,\" Valerie hummed, inching closer. \"With you beside me, I sleep like a baby.\"\nShe leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to his cheek, her lips lingering just a little longer than needed.\nAustin let out a quiet breath, still focused on the pan—but his ears had turned slightly red.\n\"How about you wait at the table?\" he asked, voice low, almost cautious. \"I’ll be done in a few minutes.\"\nValerie’s eyes sparkled with mischief. \"Why?\" she grinned, slipping her arms around his waist again. \"You don’t want me around?\"\nShe kissed him again—this time closer to the corner of his lips.\nAustin’s grip on the egg tightened, his knuckles whitening.\n\"Val...\" he muttered, jaw tense, \"you know why.\"\nBut that didn’t stop her.\nHer fingers began trailing slowly up his chest, her lips brushing against the shell of his ear as she whispered, voice dripping with playful heat,\n\"Unless you tell me... I won’t understand.\"\nAustin swallowed hard.\n\"I’m trying to cook here,\" he murmured, fighting a losing battle against the urge to spin around and pin her right there.\nValerie let out a sultry little laugh, pulling back just enough to look at him. \"You can’t expect me to behave when my lord looks so good in this apron?\"\nAustin heaved a sigh before telling her, \"This is the first step to impress your parents. Please have some mercy on me.\"\nValerie giggled before she gave another brief kiss and stepped away.\nLeaning against the counter, she asked, \"Mom was really surprised. I am sure Dad would be too.\"\nAustin arrived last night, but it was too late, so they chatted briefly.\nToday was the real day. Austin wanted to spend this day with his in-laws and assure them that their daughter was in good hands.\n\"Well, I hope I can convince my father-in-law not to find another son-in-law this time around.\"\nValerie sighed remembering that meeting with her father and the whole ordeal.\nAustin glanced at her before apologizing, \"I am sorry if I reminded you of something bad.\"\nValerie shook her head, \"No, it’s okay. Nowadays, nothing makes me sad.\" With a beautiful smile she added, \"With everyone back to us, the only thing I feel is elation.\"\nAustin smiled at the girl as he finished cooking breakfast.\n\"Leave these to the maids. They would serve it.\" Valerie said as she offered her hand to Austin\nAustin took her hand and they stepped out of the kitchen together.\nThey slowly walked down the hallway as Austin asked, \"Hey, Val...do you think I should help Rhea realize her origin and improve her skills?\" She is the reincarnation of Kane, and the sooner she realizes the stronger she will be when the demon Lord appears.\nWhile Austin had already prepared a plan on how to deal with the danger, he wanted a few strong generals to stand on his side just in case.\nAnd Rhea could be one of them.\nValerie’s hold turned stiff on his hand as she looked away and said, \"Not now...wait for a few weeks.\"\nAustin hummed in question, \"Did something happen?\"\nValerie thought of not telling him for a moment, but then, she revealed, \"She still has feelings for you. And with those feelings, if you approach her, she would hope that maybe she has a chance.\"\nAustin sighed...yes, there was that too.\nRhea was...attached to Austin like any other man around her. Maybe because she sympathizes with him? Regardless, as Valerie said, Rhea still might have some feelings for him.\n\"Alright. I won’t approach her. Not now, at least.\" Now that Parkinson wasn’t blamed and Rudolph was by her side, her focus would remain on them most of the time.\nThey chatted casually and made their way to the reception—only to pause as a butler hurriedly stepped inside the mansion.\n\"Terry, what’s the matter?\" Valerie asked, bringing a halt to his hurried steps.\nThe butler turned toward the lady before informing them, \"Someone from the Council has arrived and they are asking for a meeting.\"\nValerie frowned while Austin gestured to the butler to proceed.\n\"The Council...this soon?\" Valerie asked while glancing at Austin.\nThe blond one shrugged, \"Well, let’s see what they have to say.\"\nNot so long after, Valerie’s father stepped out of his room, all dressed up before he glanced at the two teenagers.\n\"Valerie...it would be better for you to be inside.\"\nValerie frowned, but before she could say anything, Austin said, \"I think they are here for her, Father.\"\nAdam frowned before he wordlessly stepped out.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.\nFollow current novels on freewe(b)novel.c(o)m",

      "content": "Chapter 299: Chapter 298- Husband\nIn the reception hall, aside from Valerie and Austin, three others were seated, deep in a serious conversation.\nAustin had planned for this. He had taken it upon himself to wipe out the demons before the council’s warriors could arrive. It was intentional—he wanted to draw their attention and make them realize that someone from Eryndor was involved.\nAnd thankfully, they had taken the hint. That’s why they are here now.\n\"I don’t get it,\" Adam said, frowning. \"You’ve been seeing more monsters these past few days, and before you even get there, they’re already gone. But what does that have to do with Valerie? She’s been with us the whole time.\"\nTo him, it sounded like they were blaming her—and he didn’t like it.\nHowever, one of the council members calmly replied, \"The Council has reached a conclusion. The number of demons defeated in such a short time... it could only be done by a high-ranking warrior. And as far as we know, only Miss Valerie fits that description.\"\nAdam frowned. What are they even talking about?\nBut before he could speak, Austin stepped in, his tone calm yet sharp.\n\"Hunting demons is an act of honor and courage. Why would anyone even want to deny that?\"\nHis words made the council members pause, visibly uncertain, until the man seated to the left responded, \"We don’t know either. But the report we received led us here.\"\nAustin gave a dry chuckle. \"Repeating the same thing won’t make it true, officer. And even if Valerie did take out those monsters, it was for the sake of protecting her motherland. What’s so wrong about that?\"\nAnother councilman leaned forward, his voice firm, eager. \"We just want to guide her to a place more suited to her abilities. Somewhere she can grow... be refined. There are people who can help her understand what she’s lacking, and how to overcome it.\"\nHis enthusiasm made Austin smirk. They’re desperate, huh?\nLeaning back, Austin crossed his arms and asked, \"And who decided Valerie isn’t perfect already—?\"\n\"Can you not speak on her behalf?\" the man on the left snapped, his tone laced with arrogance. \"We’re here to hear her opinion, not yours. So just shut—\"\nSCREECH.\nThe sound was sudden, eerie.\nHe stopped talking mid-sentence.\nHis eyes went wide.\nValerie hadn’t drawn a weapon. She hadn’t even risen from her seat.\nAll she did... was turn her gaze toward him.\nThat single, cold glance froze the air between them.\nIce crawled up his legs, climbed his arms, and wrapped his entire body in a thick coat of frost.\nHis breath hitched. His limbs wouldn’t move. His thoughts were slowing, fogging, like frost biting into his brain.\nThe other councilman leapt to his feet, startled. Horror painted his face.\nValerie slowly stood, her voice a frozen whisper that scraped against the walls.\n\"You barged into my house, spoke whatever you pleased. I tolerated that.\"\nShe stepped closer to the man now shivering in his seat.\n\"But insult my husband?\"\nHer breath steamed in the air as she leaned in, her words soft, merciless.\n\"Make no mistake... I don’t need monsters to justify blood on my hands.\"\nThose words were enough for the two officers to realize they had overstayed their welcome. Without another word, they decided to leave.\nAustin gently took Valerie’s hand and led her to the dining table.\nAdam stayed behind, smoothing over the situation with a professional tone, keeping things from escalating further.\nValerie glanced at her Lord and saw him smiling.\nHer anger faded slightly, replaced with curiosity. \"What happened?\" she asked.\nAustin looked at her, eyes gleaming with amusement. \"I think your father must’ve been a little surprised to hear you casually call me husband.\"\nValerie blinked. \"Wait... did I really?\" she muttered, slightly dazed.\nShe hadn’t even realized it. Maybe it was because, in her heart, she had always called him that. Even after the reset... the word came to her as naturally as breathing.\nAustin slipped an arm around her waist and leaned close, his voice low and warm against her ear.\n\"You looked insanely hot back there... scared me a little. In a good way.\"\nValerie let out a soft laugh, her ears flushing red as she lowered her gaze with a smile.\nThey stood there, lost in each other’s eyes, playful silence dancing between them—\nUntil someone cleared their throat loudly.\n\"If you two are done flirting,\" Adam said dryly, \"can we eat now?\"\nAustin felt a little embarrassed. He gave an awkward smile and nodded, trying to play it off.\nValerie sighed softly and shook her head at his reaction.\n\"Did you send them off?\" she asked, turning her attention to Adam.\nAdam gave a small nod. \"Yes... or rather, they ran off on their own. But I doubt that’ll be the end of it. I’m sure they’ll send someone else next time.\"\nAustin leaned forward slightly and said with confidence, \"Don’t worry, Father. We’ll handle it—just like today.\"\nAdam gave him a long look, then slowly nodded, satisfied with the reassurance. With the tension in the air finally fading, the three of them made their way to the dining table, where Anastasia was already waiting for them.\nAs they took their seats, Adam sat at the head of the table with Anastasia on his left and Valerie on his right. Austin took the seat next to Valerie. The maids entered quietly and began placing breakfast on the table—freshly baked bread, poached eggs, golden pancakes, and a few other carefully prepared dishes.\nJust as Adam picked up his fork to take the first bite, Anastasia spoke with a smile, \"I made breakfast today.\"\nHer words made Austin glance at her in confusion, but before he could say anything, he felt Valerie gently squeeze his hand under the table. That small gesture told him everything—stay quiet.\n\"Hm? So that’s why you were up so early?\" Adam asked with a warm smile. He cut a slice of pancake, took a bite, and immediately lit up.\n\"This is excellent,\" he said, clearly surprised. \"Perfectly sweet and soft—just the way I like it.\"\nHe reached out and held Anastasia’s hand affectionately, still smiling from the taste.\nBut then she gave him a playful look and said, \"Sorry~ I lied. I wasn’t the one who made breakfast today.\"\nAdam blinked, confused. \"Then who did?\"\nShe didn’t answer with words. Instead, she simply tilted her head slightly, her gaze shifting toward the boy seated across from her.\nAdam followed her line of sight until his eyes landed on Austin.\n\"You cooked this?\" he asked, genuinely surprised.\nAustin scratched the back of his neck and replied a little shyly, \"Ah... yeah. I woke up early and had some free time, so I thought I’d help out a bit.\"\nBut before he could say more, Valerie cut in, smiling knowingly. \"That’s not true. He woke up early on purpose because he wanted to impress you.\"\nAustin turned toward her with a small frown. Why did she have to say that out loud?\nAdam let out a soft chuckle and leaned back in his seat. \"Well, either way, the food is delicious. You’re a good cook, Austin.\"\nThe blond prince gave a quiet nod, slightly flustered but happy. With that, the family settled into their meal, the tension from earlier forgotten, replaced by warmth, laughter, and the comfort of shared food.\n.....\n\"What? She froze you?\" Hearing the report from the officer the Council Head frowned.\n\"Yes, sir...she was not easy to converse with, forget about coming to the Council Headquarters.\" He responded.\nThat response made the man behind the table frown in displeasure.\nThey have been trying to get her under their wing for some time now, but every time she flatly rejects their proposal, saying she wants to enjoy her usual life.\nAnd this time, she even attacked an officer.\nThis was beyond tolerable.\n\"What should we do, sir?\" Asked another officer, his brows were drawn closer as well.\nThe man remained silent for a few moments.\nSelner was not around and when someone visited her office, they found a note saying,\n[I am off to somewhere for some time. Don’t bother searching for me.]\nMaybe if she had been around, they could have taken her advice or might have requested her to convince Valerie.\nBut now they have to think of something by themselves.\nHe was still thinking when someone suggested,\n\"How about we use her weakness?\"\nThe head asked, \"What do you mean?\"\nThe man stepped forward, \"I mean fear is one of the emotions that changes one’s opinion instantly.\"\n\"Hmm?\" The head frowned as he realized what he was saying here.\nUsing someone close to Valerie to make her realise the importance of the Council. And once she realises that, she wouldn’t be any more reluctant.\nThere was risk...but it was worth it. More so, when Drenovar on verge of war with Eryndor.\nThey can’t let the S-rank become a part of that war.\nThat’s why, \"Okay. Let’s do it your way.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- This Chapter took me 2.5 hours to write. Thanks for reading.",

He was constantly planning and training, always thinking ahead. He had no choice—he knew how strong his enemies were, and how weak he was in comparison. So, he worked harder than anyone else, just to make sure Valerie stayed safe.\nBut now... things were different. He knew what needed to be done, and he finally had the strength to do it. He wasn’t careless, but for once, he wasn’t thinking only about fighting.\nNow, he wanted to live a calm and peaceful life with his family and his wife.\n\"Never thought I’d get rejected though,\" Austin sighed, thinking about the talk he had with his father-in-law about marriage.\nHe had planned to marry Valerie next year, once they both turned eighteen. The legal age for marriage was sixteen, so they weren’t breaking any rules. And since Valerie had already said yes, Austin didn’t want to keep her waiting.\nBut Adam didn’t approve. He thought Austin’s sudden show of love was too recent and might not last. To him, Austin was rushing into things.\nValerie was clearly upset—and she had every right to be. But Adam wasn’t completely wrong either. In this timeline, he had seen his daughter being ignored and hurt by the very boy who was supposed to protect her smile.\nSo, of course, Adam had his doubts. That’s why he asked them to wait until after graduation to decide on marriage.\nValerie didn’t agree at first, but Austin eventually calmed her down and convinced her to wait.\nIt was close to midnight, and Austin had stepped out of the inn for a quiet walk on his own.\nValerie was resting inside—after their long, four-hour session of love making. She had fallen asleep halfway through their bath, and Austin had gently carried her to bed.\nHe wasn’t feeling sleepy at all, which is why he decided to wander around the town a bit. Despite the late hour, the place was still lively.\nMany eateries were still open, and it made sense—this town was well-known for its hunter guilds. Most hunters came back late at night to report on their missions, so the streets often stayed noisy even at this time.\n’What do you think, system? Would I get drunk?’\n[Your resistance to poison is at its peak, host. It’s nearly impossible for any alcohol to affect you.]\nAustin chuckled to himself. ’Well, that was expected. But still, I want to take my chances.’\nWith that thought, he stepped inside a nearby bar, brushing off the cool night air as the warm scent of alcohol and roasted meat welcomed him in.\nThe place was lively, filled with chatter and laughter. Hunters, mercenaries, and travelers filled most of the seats, yet a few tables remained unoccupied—scattered near the edges of the hall.\nChoosing to keep a low profile, Austin took a seat in the far corner, close to the window. It offered a decent view of both the bar’s interior and the quiet street outside.\nNot long after, a waiter appeared beside him, dressed in a simple black vest and apron. \"What would you like to order, sir?\" he asked politely, holding a small notepad.\nAustin glanced briefly at the menu on the wall before replying, \"Hmm, I’ll take the strongest liquor you’ve got—and throw in a meat pie with it.\"\nHe wasn’t particularly hungry when he stepped inside, but after seeing the trays of steaming food being served all around, his appetite woke up. The smell alone was enough to tempt anyone.\nThe waiter quickly jotted down his order and gave a courteous nod before walking off.\nLeaning back slightly in his seat, Austin let his eyes roam around the bar. It didn’t take him long to realize that nearly everyone inside gave off a noticeable presence—clear signs of awakened individuals. Warriors, mages, rogues—there was a solid mix here, and many of them were stronger than average.\nYet what truly caught his attention wasn’t their strength. It was the fact that, at some point or another, every single person in the bar had turned their gaze toward him—even if just for a second.\n’Hmm... that’s strange,’ Austin thought, narrowing his eyes ever so slightly.\nBy all means, no one here should have been able to sense anything from him. His aura was completely restrained—concealed by design. Anyone trying to sense his soul would only feel a weak, almost lifeless presence, as if he were just a normal civilian.\nAnd yet, he could feel their eyes on him. Curious. Alert. Almost... cautious.\nHe leaned forward, resting an elbow on the table as a faint smile tugged at his lips.\n’Looks like they had already made their move.’\nNot long after Austin settled in, the waiter returned with a few dishes.\nAlongside a steaming overflowing mug of alcohol, there was a freshly baked meat pie, a couple of warm bread rolls, and some small side snacks neatly arranged on the tray. The aroma of roasted meat and herbs filled the air, blending with the rich fragrance of the liquor.\nAustin picked up a spoon and lazily scooped up a chunk of the meat pie. Just as he brought the spoon to his mouth, a figure cloaked in a long, dark coat approached him from the side.\nWithout paying the person much attention, Austin calmly continued to eat.\nThe stranger took the seat directly across from him, moving without saying a word. At that moment, the atmosphere in the room subtly shifted. The air grew colder, and a sudden, heavy silence fell over the café.\nIt felt as if every single person around them had gone quiet. Eyes were watching. Breaths were held. The whole room seemed to freeze in time.\nBut Austin remained unbothered by the unnatural stillness. He casually took another bite, savoring the flavors, as if nothing had changed.\nThen, the stranger finally pulled back the hood of her cloak.\nShe was a woman in her early thirties, with short black hair and piercing dark green eyes that locked onto Austin with sharp focus. There was no warmth in her gaze—only the weight of her presence, cold and direct.\n\"Hmm...\" Austin raised his brows slightly. He was surprised, genuinely.\nThe woman’s voice broke the silence, firm and unyielding.\n\"Austin von Erybdor... you need to come with me.\"\nHer tone was like the edge of a blade—leaving no room for argument. It was the kind of voice that warned of consequences without needing to spell them out.\nStill, Austin didn’t respond right away. He calmly picked up the mug instead and took a few slow sips, letting the chill fill his mouth and throat.\n\"Fuaa... this is great,\" he said, clearly satisfied, as he placed the mug back on the table with a loud, echoing thud.\nOnly then did he lift his gaze to the woman sitting across from him.\n\"I expected someone to make contact sooner or later,\" he said, a faint grin forming on his lips. \"But I didn’t think they’d send an S-rank. Looks like the Council is getting impatient.\"\nHe knew her—he had seen her once before, back during the war against the Parasite Chief.\nHannah.\nA cold-blooded killer.\nAssassin-class.\nFourth-ranked.\nHer presence barely stirred the air, her soul energy so faint it was nearly undetectable—exactly how a true assassin should be. That, more than anything, proved her skill.\nIn a direct fight, someone like Valerie might overpower her. But in the shadows, given the right setting and enough space, Hannah could become a nightmare to deal with.\nHer eyes narrowed as she spoke again, her tone sharp with frustration.\n\"Your little lover injures one of our officers, tosses them aside, rejects the Council’s offers again and again—and then you sit here and mock us for being desperate.\"\nShe gave him a cold, scornful glare.\n\"Be grateful I wasn’t sent to deal with that girl directly,\" she said. \"Had that been the case, things would’ve turned out very differently. And you might have turned desperate to gain my forgiveness.\"\nAustin chuckled, a low amused sound.\n\"Spoken with such confidence... you do know she has awakened one of the Tools of Destruction, right?\"\nHannah crossed her arms, clearly unimpressed. \"People that young often leave themselves wide open.\"\nAustin shook his head.\nThese Council people...they always remain so full of themselves that it’s amusing.\n\"So what do you need from me?\" Austin asked, finishing the meat pie.\n\"Come with me. The Council wants to let that girl know what a foolish path she has been walking on.\"\nAustin frowned, \"So you all are going to make it seem like I got kidnapped, and when Valerie feels helpless in her search, you will appear like an aid?\"\nShe smirked, \"You don’t look like it but you are quite an intelligent brat.\" With a nod, she affirmed, \"Yes, that’s exactly what I am going to do.\"\nAustin leaned back, \"So you plan on making my Val worried and cry, huh?\"\nThe woman shrugged, \"Come on now-\" she paused just as she got up from the seat.\nSomething fell on either side and a burning sensation emerged from the sides.\n\"Huh?\" It took her a moment...then it settled.\nHer arms...they were chopped off.\n\"Ahhhh!\" She staggered back and instantly, the whole place was filled with her cries.\nEvery single customer got up, summoning their Shards.\nOn the side, the waiter, the chef, and the guards also took out their weapons.\nAustin sighed as he finished the drink and muttered, \"Well, this could be a good after-meal workout.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 301: Chapter 300- Sugar baby\n\"So? What do you think?\" Austin asked as he leaned against the guardrail and looked at the beautiful garden before him.\nValerie sat on one side, quietly sipping a cup of freshly brewed coffee.\nAcross from her, Selner leaned against the wall with her arms crossed, silent for a while before finally speaking.\n\"You do know you no longer have my support, right?\"\nAustin gave a small nod. \"Yeah, I figured. Now that I think about it... your sister must’ve guessed you might help me again. That’s probably why they took your powers.\"\nIn her current state, Selner would freeze—just like Valerie had—if the higher beings descended again.\nThat’s why the real question was, \"How are you planning to face those Gods?\" Selner asked.\nAustin’s only protection had been the witches—but that option was gone now.\nValerie frowned. \"So... in exchange for giving me back my memories, you sacrificed Austin’s protection?\"\nSelner didn’t reply. It was Austin who stepped in.\n\"Don’t blame her, Valerie. I’m more grateful than I can say for what she did. Besides, I never saw the witches as Plan A to begin with.\"\nValerie let out a soft sigh, realizing her words might have been too harsh.\n\"...I’m sorry,\" she said gently.\nSelner shook her head. \"It’s fine. It’s not like I don’t feel the same regret and fear. The thought of him facing those beings alone is enough to keep me up at night.\"\nAustin looked between the two and raised his voice slightly, \"Hello? Ladies? As I said, the witches were never my primary plan. I’ve always had something else in mind—something that can deal with Astaroth and keep those divine pigeons away.\"\nAustin laid out his plan. Selner’s expression didn’t change, but Valerie looked thoroughly impressed.\n\"Reckless,\" Selner muttered.\n\"Amazing,\" Valerie said at the same time.\nTwo women, two very different reactions.\nValerie shot a glare at the elder witch. \"It’s still better than trying to fight them head-on.\"\nSelner sighed. \"I know. But this world is part of their dominion just like many others. What if they decide to sacrifice it... and simply move on?\"\nAustin shrugged. \"I don’t think they will. And honestly, pushing them to that point is only my backup plan. The real plan is still to break the pact—and kill the Demon Lord right in front of them.\"\nValerie nodded firmly. \"That’s bold. But it’s also achievable.\"\nAustin smiled at her, then turned to Selner. \"You don’t think I have the strength, do you?\"\nSelner shook her head. \"It’s not about strength. Astaroth has lived for centuries. His will to rule isn’t something easily broken... and this plan may not be enough to counter that.\"\nAustin’s gaze hardened. \"Astaroth might be a powerful foe who’s ruled for generations—but he’s never faced someone like me. He’s never had a reason to doubt his own immortality.\"\nHe stepped closer and looked Selner in the eye.\n\"And I, Selner, am confident enough to remind him that he’s still just a mortal.\"\nThe witch held his gaze for a few seconds before giving a casual shrug.\n\"Since you’ve already made your decision, there’s no point in trying to stop you.\"\nAfter a brief silence, Valerie stood up and asked,\n\"So, what are we going to do about the Council?\"\nAustin shook his head.\n\"They’re not worth the trouble. Zevarath will be making his move soon, so let them stay busy with that.\"\nHis eyes grew sharp as he continued,\n\"We need to focus on uniting the nations. That way, if an army ever shows up again, humanity will be ready to defend itself.\"\nSelner spoke up,\n\"Aren’t you planning to wipe out the Generals and their armies before they even cross the border?\"\nThat was exactly the plan—simple and direct. No complicated strategy. Just pure destruction.\nAustin already knew which demons to watch out for—those who preferred to use underhanded tricks rather than face him directly.\nAnd at the top of that list was the Succubus Queen.\n\"Austin... I think you need to get your priorities straight,\" Selner said firmly. \"If you truly want to protect your people, then you have to act fast. There are too many you care about—and unless you’re planning to gather them all and lock them away for safety, you’d better strike first and strike hard.\"\nAustin gave a quiet nod in response, fully aware she was right.\nThere were people at the academy, his parents, Valerie’s parents, and many others who were closely connected to both him and Valerie.\nBefore the Demon General could make his move, Austin had to give him a reason to back off—a warning so loud that the enemy would think twice before advancing.\n\"Okay, I’ll leave in two days.\"\nValerie visibly flinched at those words.\nEven though she knew how strong her husband was, she couldn’t stop herself from worrying every time he crossed over to the other side.\nBut stopping him wasn’t an option. She knew that if her hesitation held him back, she might end up causing him the same kind of pain he had already endured once.\n\"Alright then, I’m heading out,\" Selner said, preparing to open a teleportation portal and return to the academy dorm.\nBut Austin stopped her.\n\"Won’t you join the celebration?\" he asked.\nInside the palace, everyone had gathered to celebrate his birthday.\n\"And how are you planning to introduce me?\" she asked, a thin, challenging smirk playing on her lips.\nAustin hesitated for a moment, just long enough to make Valerie tense.\n\"The first thing that came to your mind was ex-wife, wasn’t it?\" she pressed, eyes narrowing.\nAustin blushed. \"Wh-What are you even saying?!\"\nSelner suddenly laughed—a light, beautiful laugh that caught both of them off guard.\nIt was the first time they had seen her laugh so freely, without a trace of her usual restraint.\nValerie let out a soft sigh and shook her head.\n\"I’ll just tell them you’re my teacher. Now come on, let’s go.\"\nSelner no longer resisted as she was gently pulled inside by her student.\nAustin, now composed, followed behind them.\nInside the hall, his mother was busy directing the maids as they arranged decorations.\nSnacks and drinks had been neatly placed on the side, even though the celebration was a small, family-only gathering.\nThe only guest present was Selner.\n\"Mother... you know I don’t need all this, right?\" Austin said, sounding a little embarrassed.\nSophia smiled sheepishly. \"It just felt too plain for a celebration. So... just a little touch here and there.\"\nHer gaze then shifted to the violet-haired woman standing beside Valerie.\n\"Hello,\" she greeted, a bit curious.\n\"Ah, mother,\" Valerie said, stepping forward, \"this is my teacher and a close friend.\"\nSelner gave a brief, graceful bow. \"Pleased to meet you, Your Majesty. I hope I’m not imposing.\"\nSophia’s face brightened. \"No, please—Valerie’s friend is like family. You’re more than welcome here.\"\nSelner smiled in response before the silver-haired woman turned to her son and said,\n\"Please make her feel comfortable. I’ll go bring Avy.\"\n\"I’ll get her, Mother,\" Valerie volunteered quickly, and the two women disappeared deeper into the palace.\nAustin gestured for Selner to take a seat.\nWithout a word, she walked toward the sofa and sat down.\n\"I can tell your mother isn’t a bad person,\" she said softly. \"She was just influenced by a dark presence.\"\nAustin let out a quiet sigh.\n\"Well, humans can be nasty. Sometimes we get so greedy that we lose sight of emotions—and forget how much our actions can hurt the people around us.\"\nSelner gave a thoughtful hum.\n\"How is she now? Still mourning Aiden’s death?\"\nAustin shook his head.\n\"She hasn’t completely moved on, but she’s starting to be herself again. More than the pain of losing him, she regrets the reason he ended up that way.\"\nSelner sighed.\n\"Well, no one’s really at fault. Circumstances shape people.\"\nLeaning back into the sofa, she added with a faint smile,\n\"Just like how a string of breakups turned you into such a loyal man for Valerie.\"\nAustin gave a wry smile.\n\"Don’t tell me you used to watch me when I lived as Luke.\"\nSelner grinned.\n\"Not regularly... but yes, I did.\"\nThen, with her eyes narrowing and a mischievous smirk on her lips, she teased,\n\"Did you ever tell Valerie exactly how many confessions you received back then? If I remember right, there was even that one time your teacher proposed to make you her sugar ba—\"\n\"Okay now, stop!\" Austin raised his hands in a panic.\n\"What are you talking about?\" Came a chilling voice from behind.\nAustin froze for a moment before he slowly turned to his back.\nThere, a smiling Valerie stood with her eyes turned crescent.\nAveris, who was just beside her, realized that she had entered the red zone, which is why she made a tactical escape.\nAnd Selner too, found the snacks a bit too tempting to remain seated.\nValerie inched closer and asked sweetly, \"Dear...what was she saying about you getting proposed to by your teacher? Care to share details?\"\n*GULP*\n-------**-------\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 302: Chapter 301- For the last time\nShe had carried many names over the years, slipping into different identities like changing masks.\nMonica.\nJasmine.\nAnd many others.\nBut her true name—the name of the Succubus Queen—was known only to a chosen few. She rarely found it worth sharing. To her, it was never the name that mattered, but the pride she took in who she was and the power she possessed.\nIn the first timeline, when Austin entered the demonic realm to end the war, she was given a single task—stall him. Hold him off long enough for Astaroth’s final fragment to be taken away.\nFor someone who took pride in her beauty and the art of seduction, making a man fall for her should have been effortless.\nAnd so, she accepted the mission with grace. She would face Austin alone, in all her glory, as the perfect temptation.\nBut what she received in return were two swift slashes across her body.\nShe failed.\nHer charm couldn’t reach him.\nThe man was like stone—unshaken, untouched.\nNo matter what she tried, he never gave her a chance.\nShe couldn’t delay him long enough.\nIn the end, as she dropped to her knees, bleeding and broken, she made a vow.\nA final oath spoken through clenched teeth:\nWherever Austin’s soul is reborn, she will find him—and make him pay.\nAnd she did.\nReborn as Monica, she lured him in.\nMade him fall, made him crave her.\nShe played the game well—the sweet chase, the teasing distance.\nLetting him come close enough to think he had her, only to pull away when he reached out.\nShe still remembers his face the day she broke his heart.\nThe shattered look in his eyes.\nThat moment still warms her scarred heart like a cruel ember.\nIt made her feel alive again. As if, in some twisted way, her revenge had begun.\nBut it wasn’t enough.\nNow, he’s been reborn again.\nAnd this time, he lives with only one goal—to wipe out the demon race.\nShe sat upon her throne, lounging with effortless grace. Her two hounds lay asleep at her feet, their breathing deep and steady.\nHer gaze was fixed on the marble floor—calm, composed—yet she could feel it.\nFeel him.\nHe was coming.\nA small smile curved her lips just as the great doors of the throne room dissolved into dust, vanishing like mist in sunlight. From the opening stepped a familiar blond teenager.\n\"It took you longer than I expected,\" she said, her grin casual, voice smooth as silk.\nAustin sighed. \"I thought I’d finish off your Lord before coming here. Turns out he’s gone into hiding—must’ve sensed death coming.\"\nThe Succubus Queen chuckled softly. \"You know your words can’t rile me up, right?\"\nAustin raised an eyebrow. \"Why would I try to provoke someone so vastly beneath me? To me, you’re not even a general—you’re barely a foot soldier.\"\nHer smile remained, but the light in her eyes dimmed. The amusement faded.\nShe met his gaze and said, \"You can’t kill him. He’s under divine protection.\"\nAustin let out a low chuckle. \"And you think I care?\" He tilted his head. \"Didn’t the memories you share with your Lord show you? I met his patrons. Met them—before I flipped the world and tore through time itself.\"\nThe Queen dropped the act. Her playful mask vanished as her tone turned sharp and cold.\n\"And you think that just because they allowed you to reverse time, they’ll break their pact too?\"\nAustin hummed thoughtfully. \"That’s his problem to worry about. But you...\"\nStep.\nA single step echoed—and in an instant, he was no longer meters away.\nHe stood right before her.\nThe General’s composure cracked. Her eyes widened, and a breath caught in her throat.\n\"...you should be worried about yourself.\"\nHer gaze locked with his. She saw it—the inevitable end.\nHer death was close.\nThat’s why she said it.\n\"I want to switch sides.\"\nAustin blinked, visibly surprised.\n\"I’ll make a binding vow. Swear loyalty to you.\"\nHe leaned back slightly, brows rising. \"Wow. So your loyalty shifts based on how strong your opponent is?\"\nShe shrugged, unbothered. \"I’m loyal to the man who can protect me. Astaroth can no longer. But you... You’re the one I’ve been waiting for.\"\nHer voice softened, eyes gleaming with allure.\n\"You know I can make you happy, Luke. We’ve spent months together... exploring each other.\"\nHer smile turned gentle, almost tender.\n\"I know you...your needs, your pain, your heart—better than anyone.\"\nFor a moment, Austin’s expression wavered. And in that moment, she felt hope.\nRising slowly from her throne, she stepped closer. Her fingers brushed against his chest—warm, delicate.\n\"You don’t need to tell Valerie anything,\" she whispered. \"Let me be your secret. You can tell the world I died, and hide me... just for yourself.\"\nUnseen, her magic pulsed softly through the air—subtle, intoxicating. The room began to shift.\nThe air thickened with pheromones and a faint aphrodisiac essence.\nShe was casting the spell without a word—because sometimes, temptation didn’t need incantations.\nHowever, just as she thought she had reached his heart—just as she believed she had finally captured it—\nSQUELCH.\nTime froze.\nHer breath hitched as something hot tore through her stomach. For a split second, she couldn’t believe it.\nThis couldn’t be real.\nShe had convinced him.\nPlayed him.\nLured him in, tempted him to surrender to her charms.\nSo then... what changed?\nShe staggered back, a warm rush of blood spilling down her body and pooling at her feet. Her knees buckled.\nHer hounds leapt toward Austin, snarling—\nBut they never made it.\nThey turned to dust mid-air, disintegrating before they could even touch him.\nShe looked up at him, wide-eyed, the pain just now catching up to her.\nAustin raised his bloodstained hand, then wiped it clean across her dress.\n\"Well... It’s fun, isn’t it?\" he said, voice cold but calm.\n\"To let you believe you were about to succeed—at the one thing you’ve always taken pride in—only to realize just how big of a failure you really are.\"\nHer crimson eyes flared with fury.\n\"Y-You... you knew...from the beginning...?\"\nAustin laughed. It wasn’t a mocking laugh—it was cruel, hollow.\n\"Of course I did,\" he said. \"I only pretended to be caught in your web... just so I could watch your pathetic little performance.\"\nHis gaze darkened, shadows gathering in his eyes.\n\"You were never a challenge. But breaking you like this... it tastes so much sweeter.\"\nHe raised his hand and gripped her face.\n\"Goodbye... Zenith.\"\nHer body began to fracture, pieces of her turning to glowing dust before dissolving into the air.\nShe didn’t scream.\nShe simply stared at him—confused, betrayed, defeated—as she faded away.\nAustin stood still for a moment.\nThere was no satisfaction in his eyes. No guilt either.\nNothing.\nDespite their past. Despite everything they once shared.\nShe was one of the reasons he had returned to the past.\nNot just to save his people—\nBut to make sure he would be the one to end her.\nWith his own hands.\nHe took a step back—and just as he turned around, he froze.\nStanding there was a familiar figure.\n\"You made a mistake today, warrior,\" said the Demon Lord, his arms calmly folded behind his back.\nThough his voice was calm, his red eyes burned with fury.\nBut that was all he could do—for now. This was only an illusion. A mere projection of his will. And even that couldn’t contain the storm raging within him.\nAstaroth’s vessel, Zenith, had been killed again.\nAnd Austin had done it with his own hands—again.\nIt wasn’t just a loss.\nIt was humiliation.\nAnd Astaroth’s pride would never forgive it.\n\"You can’t beat him in direct combat, Ass,\" Austin replied with a smirk. \"Why don’t you just surrender and save everyone some time?\"\nHe could already feel it—ether trembled as demonic energy thickened around the palace. The army was closing in.\nAnd among them, he sensed it clearly: the ancient presence.\nAstaroth’s son, advancing toward the throne room.\n\"You’re too full of yourself, human,\" Astaroth hissed. \"You’ve gained strength you were never meant to have. That power has made you arrogant.\"\nAustin shrugged. \"Says the guy who thought nothing in this world could ever threaten his throne.\"\nAstaroth smirked, a cold and cruel twist of his lips.\n\"Keep that smile, warrior. You’ll need it... to remember what peace felt like.\"\nHis voice dropped—no longer taunting, but sharp with promise.\n\"When I return—truly return—I won’t bring war. There will be no honor, no battlefield. Just you and me.\"\nHis eyes flared.\n\"And I swear... every single person you love, every life you’ve vowed to protect—they will breathe their last in front of you. I will make you watch.\"\nA pause. Then his voice turned low and venomous:\n\"This won’t be a battle. It will be your end. And I will tear you apart—slowly, painfully... piece by piece.\"\nAustin shrugged, \"Well, best of luck with that.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 303: Chapter 302- Call them\nCharlotte let out a tired sigh as she saved yet another squad from falling to a chimera’s assault.\nThe monster was soon taken down, giving her a brief moment to catch her breath.\nA Hellstain had broken loose near Headquarters, and she had been the only one available to respond.\nWilliam was still in the south, busy inspecting Drenovar. He had reported a few days ago that war was imminent.\nOriginally, the Council hadn’t planned to get involved. That hadn’t changed—but now, they were paying closer attention because of two individuals from Eryndor.\nCharlotte understood why they’d take an interest in that girl... Valerie, if she recalled correctly.\nBut she hadn’t expected another S-rank to emerge from Eryndor.\nAccording to the report Hannah submitted, the attacker—the one who severed both her arms—wasn’t merely a D-rank.\nAnd it didn’t stop there. The officers at the eatery were all high-ranking. Yet when the backup team arrived, all they found was a pile of unconscious soldiers.\nWhen questioned, the soldiers said they hadn’t even gotten the chance to fight.\nA single wave of energy had struck them—\nAnd then everything went black.\nCharlotte couldn’t believe them even though she trusted them and Hannah.\nSomeone who was registered as a D-rank and was at the bottom of his class...damaging an S-rank and knocking out more than thirty people with just his aura.\nYes. Impossible.\n\"Commander!\"\nThe shout snapped Charlotte out of her thoughts. She turned sharply toward the cave—the source of the Hellstain.\nTHUMP THUMP\nHer heart dropped. The pressure in the air shifted—something massive was approaching.\nThe ground shook with every step, sending loose pebbles skittering. The soldiers instinctively backed away, fear etched across their pale faces.\nIt emerged, a towering beast cloaked in thick, matted fur that moved with deadly grace. A jagged, stone-like shell covered its back like a fortress, and its long, muscular tail ended in a spiked club that smashed through trees and shattered boulders alike.\nDespite its size, it moved like a predator—silent and precise. Its sharp yellow eyes scanned the field with cold intelligence, missing nothing. Hooked claws glinted under the light, ready to tear through anything in its way.\nCharlotte’s frown deepened.\nThis was bad.\nThe soldiers weren’t equipped to fight a high A-rank beast. And she—\nShe was a support-type mage.\nThe moment the beast’s form emerged from the cave’s shadow, chaos erupted.\n\"Form ranks!\" a captain barked, rallying the soldiers into a shaky formation. Spears bristled. Shields locked. But the fear in their eyes was unmistakable.\nThe monster didn’t wait. With terrifying speed, it charged.\nCRACK!\nIts tail swung wide, smashing into the front line. Metal crumpled. Bones shattered. Three soldiers were flung like ragdolls into the trees—lifeless before they hit the ground.\nCharlotte stepped forward, slamming her palm onto her shard. A burst of white light surged from the core, and a shimmering hexagonal barrier erupted in front of the beast.\nBOOM!\nThe creature slammed into it, claws screeching against the barrier as its momentum slowed. The shield creaked, but it held—just long enough for the soldiers to regroup.\n\"Fall back in pairs!\" Charlotte yelled, her voice cutting through the panic.\nAnother volley of soldiers rushed in. One, wielding a glaive-shaped shard glowing with red runes, slashed at the beast’s leg. It left a shallow mark—barely a scratch, but it bought time.\nThe beast roared, then lunged. Its claws tore through the man’s torso, silencing him in an instant.\nCharlotte narrowed her eyes. Her shard pulsed again.\n\"Bastion—Expand!\"\nThe shield split into multiple translucent barriers, fanning out across the field. Each intercepted a strike or protected a soldier on the verge of death. But the beast was adapting—clever. It avoided the barriers now, sweeping low and fast.\nOne soldier with a hammer-shaped shard leapt, swinging down with all his strength. The weapon released a shockwave on impact, slamming into the beast’s shell.\nA chip broke off.\nCheers rose for a moment—short-lived.\nThe monster twisted, impaling the man with its tail spike, then hurled him into the trees.\n\"Enough!\" Charlotte roared. The center of her shield opened, revealing a glowing core—its true power.\nShe planted it into the earth. Runes ignited across the ground.\n\"Sanctum Break.\"\nA dome of light erupted outward, blinding the beast for a heartbeat. From within it, golden energy shards launched in a wide arc, striking the creature’s limbs and face. It staggered—injured, but furious.\nBy now, Charlotte was exhausted too. She had been fighting and protecting these soldiers for quite some time.\nBut the monster wasn’t done.\nIts massive body began to glow with an eerie golden light. It had stopped moving, eyes locked on Charlotte—unblinking, unshaken.\nHer breath caught in her throat. She knew that glow.\n\"Fall ba—!\"\nShe didn’t get to finish.\nIn an instant, a golden dome of energy burst from the beast’s body, expanding like a shockwave.\nCharlotte barely had time to raise her shield in front of her face—then BOOM!\nThe force slammed into her like a hammer.\nDHAK!\nHer body struck a tree with a heavy thud, then crumpled to the ground.\nPain shot through her side, but she forced herself up, shaking off the daze. Dirt clung to her arms. Her ears rang. But her eyes searched the battlefield first.\nSmoke and dust drifted across the ruined clearing.\nBodies were everywhere.\nOf the fifteen soldiers that came with her... only six were still standing. Barely.\n’We need backup...’\nHer grip on the shard tightened.\n’We never expected a beast this strong to come out of that Stain.’\nFalling back was no longer an option or this beast would follow them to the headquarters. But fighting it with so little manpower seemed like a suicide.\nCharlotte bit her lip and decided to take some risk...risk to her Shard.\nThe beast also turned to her, declaring her an opponent.\nThe two locked eyes, ready to deliver the finishing blow when suddenly,\n\"You seem to be in a rough shape.\"\nA voice echoed, and the barrier user instantly turned to her left\nSitting there casually was a blond teenager whom she didn’t recognise.\nThe Beast’s nose moved...it smelled it.\nThe scent of blood.\nDemonic blood.\nIt was potent and alarming.\nThe beast took a few steps back, ready to escape. But then,\n\"Time’s up.\" Austin snapped his finger and a barrier appeared behind the beast, blocking its path.\nThe inhumane being was smart. It didn’t try to break the barrier, but rather chose to flank the left, only to crash again,\n*TNGG*\nNot so long after the other two sides of the beast were locked by the light green shimmering barrier as well.\nThe beast snarled and swung its massive tail at the wall—but,\n*TNGG*\nNothing happened. Just a shrill sound rang but the barrier showed no sign of breaking.\nCharlotte couldn’t believe it.\nJust now, she failed to contain the beast within her barrier because of its sheer strength and flexibility.\nAnd here, this teenager was effortlessly using barrier magic without even summoning his Shard.\nHer eyes widened at the realization as she turned her attention towards the boy and asked, \"Are you a demon?\"\nAustin jumped from the branch as he asked, \"Why did you land on that conclusion?\"\n\"To my knowledge, no one from our side can erect such a strong barrier.\"\nAustin sighed, \"So you believe you are the best in barrier magic?\"\nCharlotte didn’t speak but the answer was clear.\nDespite being a support class warrior, she had made her way to the top by sheer hard work and strength.\nAustin nodded before biting his thumb and drawing crimson blood, \"Here...it’s red, not black. That means I am a human. And...\" He turned toward the beast and clasped his open palm.\nInstantly, the four walls of the barrier rushed towards each other, crushing the huge beast instantly into a mushy paste.\nCharlotte’s lips parted in horror at the sight.\nThat...could no longer be called a barrier.\nThat was not meant to protect or cage something.\nThe boy used his barriers to crush that whole thing into a bloody paste.\nAustin appeared beside her, startling Charlotte as he said, \"You see that?\" He asked, \"The moment you believe you are the strongest, you are dead.\"\nCharlotte couldn’t believe someone so young was teaching her a lesson right now.\n\"Who are you?\" She asked, calmer now.\nShe realized he was on their side; otherwise, he would have killed everyone here with just a snap of his fingers.\nAustin offered his hand to her, which Charlotte took before he offered his name,\n\"Austin von Eryndor.\"\n\"Huh?\" She blinked in surprise, \"So you are the person...who...\"\n\"Yes. I must say, your friend has a foul mouth.\"\nCharlotte’s expression turned bitter, \"What do you want?\"\nAustin understood her caution but since they had met today for the first time, he didn’t continue the conversation and said, \"In a week, I want every Council Head at the Headquarters. I have a declaration to make.\"\nCharlotte scoffed, \"And you believe they will come just because you want them to?\"\nAustin shrugged, backing away, as he said, \"Well, it will be their loss. See you.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Ten more Chapters I guess. Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 304: Chapter 303- Let’s just be friends\nThe academy had arranged an outing for the students.\nIt wasn’t anything grand—just a few days of camping in the forest. The goal was simple: teach them a bit about survival and give them a break from the usual routines. A chance to relax with friends, breathe fresh air, and enjoy a weekend away from their dorm rooms.\nThe forest chosen was not far from the academy—nestled between the academy and the capital. It was considered safe. A few instructors were present, but they kept their camps at a distance, allowing the students their freedom.\nIn the previous timeline, this camping trip had been canceled—three demons had attacked the academy back then, nearly killing Rudolph.\nBut not this time.\nThis time, Austin had dealt with those demons long before they could reach the academy.\nAnd so, the students were enjoying their peaceful days beneath the trees.\n\"What do you think? Looks good?\" Valerie asked as she twirled, showing off the flower tiara on her head.\nAnnabelle, her senior and the student council president with sleek black hair, clasped her hands together, eyes lighting up. \"You look beautiful. Did you make that?\"\nValerie smiled, pride in her voice. \"Austin made it for me. Picked the flowers himself—from the cliff earlier.\"\nA round of delighted squeals rose from the other girls nearby, swooning at the thought. Their eyes sparkled with admiration. Who would’ve guessed Austin could be so thoughtful?\nNearby, Sheldon raised a brow as he overheard the chatter. Seriously? That guy?\nHe couldn’t believe Austin was such a romantic. Then again... maybe he had a thing or two to learn from him.\n\"Hey, Val!\" Austin called from afar. \"Can you bring me a towel?\"\nValerie gave a small nod, then turned to Annabelle—only to find her grinning from ear to ear.\n\"Go on,\" she teased. \"Your husband’s calling.\"\nValerie blushed and quickly made her way toward the tent, trying to hide the smile tugging at her lips.\nOff to the side, Rhea quietly chopped vegetables.\nBut her hands felt heavier than they should. Her chest too.\nShe hadn’t missed the way Valerie lit up at Austin’s voice... nor the way Austin smiled back at her.\nIt had been this way for some time now.\nThey weren’t pretending. Austin had truly moved on... and found happiness again.\nAnd she should be happy for him—she told herself that every day.\nBut the truth was... she wasn’t.\nShe was restless. Unsettled.\nWhy?\n\"Rhea?\" Rudolph’s voice broke her thoughts.\nShe looked up, startled. \"Yeah?\"\n\"You okay?\"\nShe gave a half-smile. \"Of course. Why wouldn’t I be?\"\nRudolph raised an eyebrow. \"You think I haven’t noticed? You’ve been watching Austin a lot lately. Did something happen between you two?\"\nHis words struck deeper than she expected.\nWas she really that obvious?\nShe let out a soft sigh and looked down at the sliced carrots.\n\"It’s his attitude,\" she finally said. \"The way he’s changed around me... it bothers me. I can’t stop thinking about it.\"\n\"He doesn’t eat with us anymore. Doesn’t joke like he used to. And whenever we run into each other... he just gives me a polite smile and walks away.\"\nHer voice grew quieter.\n\"I just want to know... what changed? Did I do something wrong?\"\nRudolph sighed, \"Then why don’t you go talk to him to clear things up? If there is a misunderstanding, talking things out would be best, no?\"\nRhea looked up at him, \"You think this will be a good idea?\"\nRudolph crossed his arms on his chest as he said, \"Absolutely. Rather than torturing yourself with the thought of what went wrong, it would be best to call him out and ask directly.\"\nRhea exhaled a soft sigh, \"You might be right,\" her gaze moved toward Austin who was chatting smilingly with Valerie in the corner.\n....\n\"So... they called off the plan?\" Valerie asked, her voice filled with disbelief.\nHer Lord hadn’t just killed the Demon General—he had gone all the way to Drenovar and calmed the unrest there as well.\nHe used the same method as before. First, he saved the people from the spread of Hellstain, and then... he gave the former King the Elixir of Life, bringing him back from the brink of death.\nFrom that point on, everything had gone smoothly.\nJust like in the previous timeline, the King of Drenovar had bowed his head before Austin, swearing to one day repay the favor. And now, they had let go of their past resentment toward Eryndor and even proposed forming an alliance—if Eryndor was willing.\n\"Did you tell your father about it?\" Valerie asked.\nAustin simply shook his head. \"Nope. Haven’t gone home yet. Didn’t have the time. But they’ll find out soon enough.\"\nValerie smiled at that. \"And without a doubt... you’ll be chosen for the crown.\"\nAustin didn’t say anything, but he knew she was right. It was only a matter of time.\nLeaning back against a tree, he looked up at the swaying leaves and asked quietly, \"What do you think, Val? Should I become the King?\"\nValerie gave a soft smile, her eyes full of quiet warmth. \"I’ve always wanted to see you on the throne. Even when we were kids, I imagined you sitting where your father used to. It’s always been my dream.\"\nShe didn’t know why, but something about it felt right. As if the throne had always been waiting for him—not for power, not for glory—but because that seat, that responsibility, that respect... matched him perfectly.\nShe knew Austin didn’t need a crown to stand above others. His strength alone made him someone you couldn’t ignore.\nBut even so... seeing the world acknowledge him—not just as a warrior, but as a king—meant something more.\nIt felt destined.\n\"Hmm~ is that so? Then, I’ll become the King.\"\nAustin declared it without hesitation. If it was something Valerie had dreamed of... then so be it. None of her wishes would be left unfulfilled.\nHe never had an issue with taking the crown. It wasn’t the throne that bothered him—it was the timing. In his past life, there were too many battles, too many wars, too many urgent matters that demanded his strength elsewhere. Managing a nation had felt like an unnecessary chain, one that would bind him permanently to Eryndor.\nBut this time... this timeline was different.\nHe could no longer think only of Astaroth. He needed to plan for what came after.\n\"Shall we go back to the group?\" he asked.\nValerie gave a soft nod.\nBut just as they turned to leave—\n\"Austin.\"\nA familiar voice stopped them.\nThey turned around to find a pink-haired figure standing not far behind, arms crossed and expression unreadable.\nRhea.\n\"Can we talk for a bit?\" she asked, her tone calm, but her eyes said otherwise.\nAustin wasn’t surprised. He had sensed this coming for a while now.\nHe looked at Valerie beside him. She sighed quietly, offering a small smile.\n\"Please return soon.\"\nHe gave her hand a gentle squeeze in reply, then let go and stepped toward Rhea.\n\"There are too many people here,\" he said softly. \"Want to find somewhere quieter?\"\nHe didn’t want to force anything. But he could tell—whatever she had to say... she needed to say it away from watching eyes\nShe nodded without hesitation, and the two of them stepped quietly into the forest, walking aimlessly beneath the canopy of leaves.\nThere wasn’t much space between them physically, but Rhea could feel the gap he had built—one that had grown wider with each passing day. A quiet distance that hurt more than she was willing to admit.\nThey walked in silence for a while before Rhea finally spoke.\n\"Did I do something to make you angry?\"\nAustin looked ahead. \"Nope~ Why would you think that?\"\nHer response was quick, almost blunt. \"Duh. You’ve been avoiding me. You don’t train with us anymore. You don’t sit at the table. You barely even look at me.\"\nAustin let out a quiet sigh. \"I’ve just been spending time with someone I ignored for too long.\"\nRhea frowned. \"I mean... It’s not a bad thing that you’re giving Valerie attention now. I’m happy for her. But what changed your mind? You used to hate her, didn’t you?\"\nAustin stopped walking. He turned to face her.\nMemories surfaced—the old bitterness, the endless days spent resenting Valerie, and everyone who reminded him of his failures. Of everything he couldn’t protect. Of the weight he once carried alone.\nHe used to push everyone away, especially her.\nBut time had changed him.\n\"Blaming others for my failure was my biggest mistake. And thanks to you and the circumstances I have realized my mistake.\"\nLooking at her in the eyes, he said, \"I don’t hate you, Rhea, I just have found the person I should be prioritizing. So let’s continue to be friends.\"\nRhea just stared at him for a few moments. She could sense that there was no anger in his voice. Then that means...he has made his choice.\nShe didn’t say anything and just giving him a nod, she walked away.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 305: Chapter 304- A challenge?\nInside the Council Headquarters, all the important figures had gathered. A few S-rank warriors stood along the walls, quiet but alert. The air was heavy with tension.\nToday, the boy they once saw as nothing more than a spoiled prince—an anomaly—was going to make a declaration.\nCharlotte had already spoken to the Council, sharing how he had helped her. She described how easily he had crushed a beast ranked as a high-level threat. Her words had left many in the room uneasy.\nThe Council still didn’t know what to make of him.\nThis boy—Austin—had done things no one expected.\nHe had fought the Hellstain that appeared in Drenovar... alone.\nHe had defeated an A-rank beast before one of their most trusted warriors was finding it difficult to handle.\nAnd most concerning of all—he had once severed the arms of an S-rank soldier.\nIt was no longer just strange—it was dangerous.\nA person growing so powerful in such a short time... it meant one thing: he had accepted a path that no normal human ever should.\nAnd depending on what he said today... the Council might be forced to treat him as a threat.\nThat was why William, the strongest warrior among humans, was also present in the hall. Sitting in silence at the round table, arms crossed, eyes sharp—ready for anything.\n\"Will he even come?\" one of the Council Heads asked, glancing toward the empty seat beside William.\nCharlotte gave a wry smile. \"I only passed along what I was told. How could I guarantee anything?\"\nA few others sighed, already regretting their decision not to send someone to escort the boy.\nBut then—\n\"Quite an impatient bunch, aren’t you?\"\nEvery head turned sharply toward the seat beside William—the only one that had been left empty.\nAnd there he was.\nAustin.\nSitting comfortably, legs crossed, back straight.\nNo one had seen him enter.\nNot the guards at the gate. Not the scouts posted outside. Not even the warriors inside the building.\nEven William frowned, a small crease forming between his brows—he had almost missed him too.\nCharlotte stood abruptly, her hands slamming on the table. \"You—! How did you get in here?!\"\nAustin tilted his head slightly, unfazed. \"That’s not important. Let’s get to the real topic, shall we?\"\nCharlotte hesitated, feeling a bit embarrassed. Slowly, she sat back down without saying another word.\nThe Council didn’t press further. Whatever trick he used to enter, one thing was now clear—he could get in anytime he wanted.\nFor now, they pushed the security concerns aside as one of the Heads asked, \"Then tell us... Why did you call this meeting?\"\nAustin leaned back in his chair, his fingers lightly tapping the armrest.\n\"I’m sure most of you know about the four Generals of the Demon Lord—the ones who serve as his direct extensions. His power given shape.\"\nThere was a brief pause. Some of the older members nodded, while others just stared, waiting for him to continue.\nThen, someone scoffed from across the table. \"What now? Are we going to get a history lecture?\"\nAustin smiled faintly—but his eyes remained cold.\n\"Maybe. Or maybe I’m just telling you who I plan to kill next.\"\nAs Austin finished speaking, he reached into his inventory and tossed two severed heads onto the long table.\nThud. Thud.\nA wave of shock rippled through the room. Several chairs screeched back as people stood up in alarm. A few flinched. One even gasped audibly.\nBut what truly set the room on edge—was the aura.\nThe air turned heavy. Dark. Suffocating.\nEven William, ever composed, summoned his Shard without hesitation. The golden blade shimmered faintly, barely containing the rising pressure.\nAustin chuckled, impressed. \"You’re really quick to draw. Guess I can’t blame you.\"\n\"What... what the hell are those?\" one of the Council members barked, voice shaking.\nBefore Austin could answer, someone else did. Eyes wide, voice trembling.\n\"No... it can’t be... That’s one of the Demon Generals... isn’t it?\"\nThe entire room froze.\nGasps echoed across the chamber. Hands tightened over armrests. Eyes locked on the grotesque heads on the table—faces twisted in death, but power still leaking from their flesh. The kind of power that only came from something unholy.\nAustin smirked. \"Good eye. Must be your Shard telling you the truth.\"\nHe leaned back in his chair, casually pointing to the heads.\n\"Left side—weakest Demon General. Right side—daughter of the Demon Lord.\"\nSilence gripped the room. No one spoke. No one moved.\nThey couldn’t.\nThe blood may have dried, but the dark energy clinging to the heads still pulsed—like echoes of screams that had yet to fade.\nAfter a long pause, William’s calm voice broke through the stillness.\n\"...What are you?\"\nAustin didn’t blink.\nHe didn’t look away.\nHe simply smiled and said, \"A human. As far as you need to know.\"\nWilliam narrowed his eyes.\nA human, walking freely through the lands of demons... and not just surviving—but killing two of their most valuable forces?\nIt sounded insane. Impossible. But the evidence sat right there, bleeding dark energy onto the council’s polished table.\n\"What do you want from us?\" one of the Heads finally asked, voice tight.\nAustin sighed as if the question bored him.\n\"To be honest, you can’t give me anything I need,\" he said bluntly. \"Most of you are no help to me. If anyone here’s worth a damn, it’s William.\"\nA few of the council members bristled at the insult. Some scoffed. Others clenched their fists beneath the table.\nBut among them were a few calmer minds, leaders who had seen too much to react on impulse.\nOne of them leaned forward. \"Assistance in what? What exactly do you plan to do?\"\nAustin stood up.\nWithout rushing, he walked around the table, stopping near its head—where every pair of eyes could see him clearly.\nThen he spoke.\n\"I’m going to hunt down every remaining Demon General and the Demon Lord’s fragment. All of them. And I’m going to do it within a month.\"\nThe room stirred. Some almost laughed. Others bit their tongues.\nBut before the noise could grow—\n\"Now, before you all start laughing or rolling your eyes,\" Austin continued sharply, \"hear me out till the end.\"\nThe room fell silent again.\nHe held their attention like a noose.\n\"While I’m out there wiping out the enemy,\" he said, \"I need just one thing from you.\"\nHe paused, then spoke clearly:\n\"I want Eryndor under full protection from the Council.\"\nA heavy scoff came from somewhere down the table.\n\"Why would we—\"\n\"Arthur, stop.\"\nThe voice was calm, aged, and firm. The room turned as the senior-most Head raised a hand, silencing the man instantly.\nArthur blinked, confused, but said nothing.\nThe elder turned his gaze to Austin and spoke slowly.\n\"You must understand... things don’t work like that. To give full protection to the capital, we’d have to summon every resource, every soldier, every mage we have. That kind of commitment isn’t made lightly.\"\nHe didn’t say no.\nHe was simply stating the weight of the request.\nAnd Austin, from the look in his eyes, already understood it.\n\"Then do so,\" Austin said, his tone firm but calm.\n\"Only after ensuring that my people are safe... will I cross over and begin clearing out the trash.\"\nHis demand was clear:\nProtect Eryndor, and in return, he’d wipe out the demon race—one by one.\nThe room went still again.\nThe weight of his words hung heavy, until a younger Council Head finally spoke, voice laced with doubt.\n\"How can we trust that you can actually take down the Demon Generals? The ones you’ve killed so far... weren’t even the strongest.\"\nAustin let out a short chuckle.\n\"Weak, you say?\"\nHe turned toward William, a knowing smile playing at the corner of his lips.\n\"Tell me, William. How difficult was it to fight Zevarath?\"\nWilliam’s face darkened. He leaned forward slightly.\n\"He was relentless,\" he said, voice low.\n\"A tenacious commander with a massive army. It took two full days... just to suppress his forces.\"\nAustin looked back at the rest of the Council, eyes scanning across their faces.\n\"And Zevarath wasn’t even a General. He served under one.\"\nHe paused.\n\"Now imagine what the actual Generals hold at their disposal.\"\nThat shut the room up.\nEven those who had doubted him moments ago now wore uneasy expressions. Many had already begun to accept the truth—that Austin was something far beyond what they had thought. But still... some minds refused to yield.\nAustin could feel the weight of their mistrust pressing down.\nHe was growing tired.\nIf not for Selner, he wouldn’t even have bothered with this meeting. It was her faith in these people—her belief that the Council still had a role to play in protecting the common folk—that kept him here, still asking, still negotiating.\nThe oldest one in the room spoke, \"It seems many of us here still couldn’t trust your abilities...so, to give us assurance, why don’t you prove your strength?\"\nAustin’s brows went up, and then he realized what he meant.\nA grin extended the blond one’s lips as he looked towards William, \"I was always curious about how strong the Ultimate Soldier is. Guess, I am about to find out.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 306: Chapter 305- I am a human\nIt was a rare sight—to see every Council Head gathered in one place to witness a contest.\nThey had assembled on the eastern battlefield, just outside the main building.\nNaturally, an open field was chosen for this match. After all, Austin’s opponent was the strongest under the sun.\nBut that didn’t matter to him.\nThe Council Heads sat in the viewing stands, surrounded by layers of protection and alert guards stationed nearby in case of unseen threats or accidental magic surges.\nCharlotte was also present, maintaining a barrier around the Council Heads—clearly prioritizing the safety of humanity’s strongest pillars.\nAustin stood calmly in the middle of the field, hands clasped behind his back, waiting for William’s arrival.\nAs he waited, he spoke to the system in his mind.\n’Wanna give me a quest here?’\n[The host wouldn’t receive any reward worth using even if the system assigns a quest.]\nAustin sighed. ’Well, you could at least give me something I can give Valerie?’\n[Understood!]\n[Quest alert!]\n[Task: Defeat your opponent within six minutes and receive a reward.]\nAustin gave a quiet hum as his opponent finally emerged from the shadows.\nClad in golden armor, William stepped forward onto the battlefield with calm, heavy strides.\nAustin had been offered armor, too, but he declined. Armor restricted his movement.\nOf course, that decision had been taken by some as sheer arrogance.\nWilliam shot him a cold look. \"Are you sure you want me to summon my Shard?\"\n\"Unless you plan on getting injured and failing your duties afterward,\" Austin replied, his tone casual, \"you’d better not hold back.\"\n\"Very well,\" William said—and the air around him began to shift.\nHe extended his right hand, and a sharp golden crackle tore through the space before him.\nFrom the void, a sword began to materialize—long, imposing, and crackling with raw power.\nIt was no ordinary weapon, but one of the feared Tools of Destruction. A Shard revered and feared by thousands.\nAustin gave an impressed whistle as the sword stood tall before William. The man rested his palm against its hilt, waiting silently—for Austin’s response.\nAustin tilted his head. \"Shall we begin?\"\nWilliam frowned. \"You’re not seriously planning to fight me without a Shard... are you?\"\nAustin smiled. \"I am wielding my Shard. Here—look closely.\"\nHe raised his hand, and William’s eyes narrowed as he caught a faint distortion in the air around Austin’s arm—like a shimmering blur, as if the very space was peeling back. It was subtle, but unmistakable. A blade hidden in plain sight.\n\"...So be it,\" William said, his tone firm as he shifted into position.\nAustin, too, took his stance, his expression unreadable.\nThe atmosphere thickened.\nTension swirled in the air like gathering storm clouds.\nSilence fell over the field.\nA single gust of wind blew across the field.\nThen—CRACK!\nThey vanished.\nTo the untrained eye, it was as if nothing happened. But in the next instant, shockwaves exploded across the battlefield. The ground cracked. Dust shot up in walls. Metal clanged so violently that it echoed through the sky.\nAustin and William clashed at the center, their blades a blur. Austin’s invisible edge shimmered through the air, each swing sharp enough to tear through steel. William’s golden Shard met it every time, its arcs perfect and precise, like it moved by instinct.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nEach strike sent waves of pressure outward, ripping chunks from the earth, shattering distant stones. Their feet barely touched the ground before they blurred again—reappearing ten meters away, then twenty, then circling each other mid-air.\nAustin twisted mid-strike, flicking his blade from an impossible angle. William spun low and parried with a rising slash, the contact ringing like a bell struck by thunder.\nThey darted in again.\nIn the audience, almost everyone had their lips parted in shock.\nMany of them didn’t believe Austin to be that strong.\nHe was not keeping up with William but giving him a hard time to land a blow.\n\"Why in the world have we never noticed such a talent?\" One of the heads asked no one in particular.\nNo answer came. Because everyone was keeping all their focus on the battle.\nOne step. Ten slashes. A parry. A faint. Sparks. Dust.\nWilliam brought his blade down in a heavy arc—only for Austin to raise his forearm and block it with the shimmer of his invisible weapon, his knees digging into the dirt, then rebounding with a whip-fast counter. William deflected it just in time, sliding back with furrowed brows.\nTheir eyes locked—neither breathing heavily, neither injured.\nWilliam narrowed his eyes. The initial exchange had told him enough—Austin wasn’t someone he could afford to hold back against.\nRaising his sword high, William summoned a massive fireball above his head, flames swirling and roaring as they gathered into a blazing sphere the size of a carriage. The heat warped the air around it, and the ground beneath his feet cracked under the pressure.\nFrom the stands, Charlotte’s expression tightened.\n’Isn’t he going a little overboard?’ she thought, concern flickering in her eyes.\nBut William wasn’t acting out of pride or temper. He had felt it—the monstrous power behind Austin’s subtle movements, the speed, the precision.\n\"I hope you dodge this!\" William roared, his voice booming as he hurled the fireball with a sweeping arc of his blade.\nThe blazing orb tore through the sky like a meteor.\nBut Austin didn’t dodge. He didn’t even flinch.\nInstead, he launched forward, straight at the incoming inferno.\nA blur—then a single slash.\nFWWOOOOOM—!!\nThe fireball split clean in half, flames unraveling in the air before vanishing into nothing, as if swallowed by the void.\nGasps rippled through the audience.\nWilliam’s eyes widened ever so slightly.\nAustin landed lightly on the ground, his invisible blade humming with residual heat, eyes calm as ever.\n\"I don’t dodge gifts,\" he said with a faint grin.\nWilliam’s jaw was clenched, \"What...exactly are you?\"\nHe couldn’t believe that one of his strongest spells was dispelled so easily.\nAustin shrugged, \"Didn’t I tell you?\" His figure blurred and William instinctively raised his arms as Austin appeared right before him and whispered,\n\"I am just a human.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 307: Chapter 306- Date(1)\n\"Are you going?\" Austin raised his brows upon being asked as he looked at the boy sitting across from him, quietly eating.\nValerie was too tired after morning training, so Austin was having breakfast with Rudolph instead.\nRhea and Parkinson were in the library—he was helping her with an assignment so she wouldn’t fail.\nRudolph looked surprised. \"You? A guy like you doesn’t know about the festival?\"\nAustin gave a dry smile at the teasing before asking, \"What festival? I haven’t heard of any.\"\nThe summer festival was still months away, and nothing else came to mind.\n\"Oh... you mean the Harvest Festival?\"\nRudolph nodded. \"Yep. You know the town of Midir? They go all out with the celebration there. I’m thinking of taking Rhea—but with that assignment, she might not agree.\"\nHe added with a shrug, \"It’s a peaceful place. Pretty too. You really shouldn’t miss it.\"\nAustin paused, then a small smile tugged at his lips. \"Hmm~ That does sound nice.\"\n------**------\nAustin was on his way back to his room, eager to tell Valerie about the festival, when suddenly—\n\"Young master,\" a voice called out.\nHe stopped in his tracks and turned. It was Sebastian, looking unusually tense.\n\"Did something happen?\" Austin asked with a frown, noticing the panic on the older man’s face.\nSebastian hesitated, then said, \"Young master... could we speak in the office?\"\nAustin gave a small nod, and the two headed into the room, closing the door behind them.\nOnce Austin sat down, Sebastian finally spoke.\n\"I received a letter from the Capital...\" He took a steadying breath. \"Drenovar has agreed to sign a truce.\"\n\"...\"\nAustin blinked, speechless. That was it? All that tension... for this?\nSebastian noticed the odd reaction. \"Did you already hear about it?\"\nAustin gave a short laugh. \"Not exactly. And sorry for not telling you sooner—I visited Drenovar recently and gave them a hand with a few things. In return, they agreed to let go of the past grudges.\"\nSebastian only looked more confused.\nAustin could understand why. Sure, he was stronger now, but how could one person possibly resolve a conflict that had lasted for centuries?\nAustin got up from his seat before telling the man, \"Take rest Sebas. Tomorrow, you will find out everything about the incident.\"\nSebastian remained silent as Austin walked out.\nHe walked toward his room, expecting Valerie to be inside.\nAnd sure enough, when he opened the door, he found her there—along with someone else he recognized.\n\"...What are you two doing?\" he asked, surprised. One was sitting on the bed, the other on the chair.\nThey were both focused, fingers carefully moving as they knitted something.\nValerie looked up at him without stopping her hands. Selner, meanwhile, kept her eyes on the yarn, still a little awkward in her movements.\n\"Hello,\" Valerie greeted softly. She closed her eyes as he walked over, hugged her gently, and kissed the crown of her head.\n\"Selner wanted to learn something to pass the time,\" she explained.\nAustin let out a small hum. \"You know you can go out if you’re bored, right?\"\nHe knew Selner wasn’t as strong as she once was—but she wasn’t helpless either.\nShe still had teleportation magic. If things ever went south, she could vanish in a flash.\nSelner let out a quiet sigh. \"I don’t like crowded places much, so I usually avoid going out.\"\nAustin tilted his head. \"Want me to take you somewhere quiet and peaceful?\"\nThat made Selner pause. Her fingers stopped. She glanced at Valerie, unsure if she’d be upset.\nBut Valerie didn’t seem to mind. She was leaning against Austin, a soft smile on her face as she calmly continued knitting.\nSelner bit her lip, then gave a small hum in response.\nAustin made a mental note to take her somewhere nice in a few days. After all, someone who once roamed the world freely was now confined within four walls.\nThen he turned toward Valerie.\n\"You free this evening?\"\nValerie blinked. \"I have an assignment to finish... but nothing urgent. Are we going somewhere?\"\nThe excitement in her voice was already unmistakable.\nAustin nodded with a small smile. \"Just be ready this evening. I’ll come pick you up.\"\nValerie practically lit up. But unfortunately, it was still morning. She had to wait for several long hours.\nAustin then turned to Selner. \"The Council agreed to protect Eryndor.\"\nSelner raised an eyebrow. \"That was fast... Who did you threaten?\"\nAustin let out a quiet chuckle. \"You really think so little of me, huh? I didn’t threaten anyone—just defeated a certain hero.\"\nSelner paused, then looked up at him. \"You didn’t break William’s confidence, did you? He’s a valuable asset on our side.\"\nAustin grinned. \"I simply reminded him there’s still plenty of room to grow—even for someone like him.\"\nAnd with that, Selner understood why the Council had agreed so quickly.\nWatching their so-called ultimate warrior fall right in front of them must have stirred panic.\nAn anomaly had appeared out of nowhere, bringing with it the severed heads of powerful demons, then going on to defeat the one they believed was invincible.\nIt was more than a statement. It was a warning.\n\"So, they’ve requested an audience with the King,\" Austin said calmly. \"And I’ll be getting involved from here on.\"\nValerie’s eyes widened. \"Won’t that cause an uproar in the other nations?\"\nThe Council stepping in directly to protect a single nation... it was bound to stir unrest.\nTheir involvement wasn’t just rare—it was political fire.\nAustin shrugged, \"Father always dreamed of making Eryndor a strong nation. I am just playing my role as the crowned Prince.\"\nAustin wasn’t just looking at the immediate threat of the Demon Lord.\nHe was heading towards a future where he would create a peaceful world.\nA world without the fear of demons or the Gods.\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.

      "content": "Valerie was excited. Her Lord hadn't told her where they were going, which made her both thrilled and slightly annoyed.\nAnnoyed—because without knowing the destination, she had no idea how to dress.\nThrilled—because just the thought of going out with her lover was enough to make her heart flutter.\nShe settled on a black skirt that reached just past her knees and a crisp white blouse. Black earrings and a touch of makeup completed the look. She had curled her hair and left it slightly damp—an idea Selner had suggested.\nAs she looked in the mirror, Valerie felt different. She was used to formal gowns and noble wear, but today, she'd chosen something more lively—something that suited her age and spirit.\n\"I don't look silly, do I?\" she asked, just to be sure.\nSelner gave her a quick glance before returning to her sweater, nodding as she replied, \"He'll kneel the moment he sees you.\"\nValerie laughed softly. That gentle giggle lit up her face like sunshine.\nShe could hardly wait to see his reaction.\nThere was still half an hour to go, but she was too excited to sit still. So, she left early.\nAustin had told her to meet him at the back gate that opened into the forest.\nThey weren't allowed to leave the grounds without permission—so naturally, they were sneaking out.\nThis is what I imagined our school life would be like, she thought.\nThey had spent so much of their time fighting danger—first Rhea, then the demons—that moments like these had become rare treasures.\nAnd maybe that's why she couldn't stop smiling.\nAvoiding the guards and sensors with ease, she made her way toward the northern gate.\nI'll probably have to wait, she thought, knowing how early she had left.\nBut to her surprise, he was already there.\nLeaning against a tree, mumbling to himself, Austin stood with his platinum hair messily combed. He wore a red checkered shirt and black trousers—casual and simple.\nFor a few seconds, Valerie just stood there, soaking in the sight of him.\nRelief flooded her—he was casually dressed too. She had been nervous about showing up like this to a formal place, but now that worry faded away.\nAustin sensed her presence, but for a moment, he said nothing.\nThey had been together for two years. He'd seen her in all kinds of outfits. He should have been used to her beauty by now.\nBut when she walked toward him with a shy smile, he forgot how to breathe.\nAnd as she came closer, the only words he could manage were,\n\"Please go out with me.\"\nValerie chuckled, \"But I'm already married to you.\"\nAustin blinked, then rubbed the back of his neck. \"It just slipped out. Sometimes I still can't believe I'm the husband of someone this beautiful.\"\nA soft flush warmed Valerie's cheeks as she asked, \"Where are we going?\"\nAustin's lips curved into a playful smile. \"That's a secret.\"\nValerie blinked. \"Is it far?\" She glanced down at her slightly fancy sandals—marching any great distance in them didn't seem likely.\nWithout a word, Austin swept her into his arms.\n\"A–are we really going like this?\" she stammered, cheeks coloring deeper.\nHe gave a reassuring nod. \"Absolutely. Just hold on tight and enjoy the ride.\"\nNot far off, a nearby professor heard their voices and hurried to investigate. But when he reached the northern gate, silence greeted him. He scratched his head, puzzled. \"What was that noise?\"\nMeanwhile, hidden by the forest's edge, Austin was already streaking away—a blur to any normal eye, and only the keenest warrior might have guessed they'd passed. He wasn't breaking any rules; nothing said he couldn't move quickly once beyond the school grounds.\nAs they ran, he wrapped Valerie in his Absolute Barrier, ensuring her curls stayed perfect and her skirt didn't flutter wildly.\nValerie spent the entire journey staring at him. She didn't care where they were headed—her heart was content just holding her lord close and watching the sparkle in his eyes.\nAustin kept running for about ten minutes before a quaint town came into view—the place where this year's Harvest Festival was being held.\nThe festival itself was a widespread tradition, celebrated in many regions. But according to Rudolph, this particular town offered a quieter, more romantic atmosphere—ideal for couples.\nTrusting his friend's recommendation, Austin slowed down as they reached the town's entrance.\nOf course, he'd already been here once before. On that earlier visit, he'd secured two entry tokens—for himself and for Valerie. That's why, even though others were lining up, no one stopped them as they entered side by side at a more relaxed pace.\nNaturally, their arrival didn't go unnoticed.\nPeople turned to look—not just because of the way Austin carried Valerie so gently in his arms, but because of how breathtaking the two of them looked together.\n\"God is truly unfair…\" someone muttered.\n\"Ah~ what a beautiful couple. Just looking at them is healing my soul,\" sighed another.\n\"The young lady hasn't looked away from him even once.\"\n\"Damn it, get a room already!\" a third voice groaned, half-joking, half-jealous.\nBut neither Austin nor Valerie paid them any mind.\nTheir world, for now, contained only the two of them.\n\"Val....we are here.\" He gently whispered before she finally looked around to see where she was.\nAustin gently put her down as they both witnessed the town in its full glory.\nThe town was wrapped in a gentle warmth that didn't come from the sun—but from the people, the lights, and the joy that hummed through the air.\nCobblestone paths wound between quaint little houses, their windows aglow with soft lantern light.\nDelicate banners fluttered above the streets, painted with harvest colors—amber, wine red, forest green—each telling its own story of the season's blessings. The scent of fresh bread, roasted corn, and spiced cider danced in the air, pulling hearts closer to the plaza at the center of town.\nThere, in the heart of the celebration, a large campfire crackled steadily. Families, couples, and groups of friends sat around it on wooden benches and cozy blankets, sharing quiet laughter and roasted treats. The fire didn't roar—it pulsed gently, casting a golden halo across smiling faces and glowing eyes.\nLocal musicians sat under a vine-draped gazebo, playing soft tunes with flutes, violins, and the occasional strum of a lute. The music didn't demand attention—it simply blended with the night, like a lullaby woven into the wind.\nChildren danced with paper lanterns, their laughter ringing like little bells in the breeze. Shopkeepers had set up modest stalls, offering handmade trinkets, woven charms, and warm drinks for the soul.\nThere was no rush. No shouting. No overwhelming crowd.\nJust the hum of peace, the rhythm of hearts beating in harmony with the quiet music, and a thousand tiny moments strung together under a starlit sky.\nValerie's lips curved into a soft smile as her eyes took in the scene. \"This… looks so beautiful.\"\nAustin felt a quiet wave of relief wash over him at her words. Yes—this place, this moment—it had all been worth it.\nWithout needing to speak, their fingers found each other, interlacing naturally as they began walking hand in hand toward the glowing heart of the town.\nThey strolled without aim, letting the gentle rhythm of the festival guide them. Children ran past with giggles trailing behind like ribbons in the wind. Older villagers danced slowly around the campfire, their movements unhurried, drinks in hand, and laughter shared in hushed tones.\nThen, a warm voice called out to them.\n\"Oh! Why are your hands empty? Here, have some bread.\"\nIt was a middle-aged woman, her cheeks slightly rosy from the fire's glow. She carried a large basket and had been handing out food to those who passed.\nValerie stopped, a little surprised. She smiled politely and reached out to take a single warm piece. \"Thank you.\"\nThe woman's eyes sparkled. \"You two look wonderful together. Don't hesitate to come back for more, alright?\"\nValerie nodded, touched by the simple kindness, and watched as the lady turned and walked off, offering bread to the next group of passersby.\nLooking down at the still-warm loaf in her hand, Valerie whispered, almost to herself, \"I had forgotten… that kindness still prevails in this world.\"\nAustin glanced at her—not with surprise, but with understanding.\nBecause in a world so often scarred by war, betrayal, and loss, moments like this felt rare. Precious. Almost unreal.\nHe squeezed her hand and said, \"Let's forget about all that and enjoy our time here.\"\nValerie softly nodded.\nThe night was beautiful, stressfree.\nThe mood was set. The music was beautiful.\nAustin turned towards his wife. His smile warm.\nHis hand went to her waist and the other one clasped hers.\nValerie shyly smiled, her gaze drawing down for a moment before she brought her hand to his shoulder.\nThey moved in rhythm. Enjoying the moment without a care in the world.\nIn this moment, they were happy.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"Is it really okay?\" Selner asked softly as she walked beside Austin across the quiet bridge.\nShe wasn't in her usual white shirt and skirt today. Instead, at Valerie's suggestion, she wore a flowing white skirt and a light blue blouse. Her round glasses gave her a gentle charm, and her hair was tied up in a neat bun—though a few curly strands had slipped loose and framed her face.\nShe looked stunning.\n\"What is?\" Austin asked, offering his hand to her.\nSelner took it and lightly hopped over a small wet patch on the bridge.\n\"I mean… You're bringing me here like this. It kind of feels like a date, doesn't it?\"\nAustin chuckled. \"Well, yes, sort of.\" He tilted his head, smiling at her.\n\"You don't think Valerie would be upset about it?\" she asked\nHe gave a small shake of his head. \"Selner, she's the one who picked out that dress for you. If she didn't want us to come here, she would've said so. You know her well enough to be sure of that.\"\nSelner looked uneasy. \"Even after knowing… our past… neither of you seems bothered by it.\"\nAustin turned to face her, one brow slightly raised. \"Tell me honestly, Selner… are you enjoying yourself here?\"\nShe blinked, a little caught off guard by the question, then glanced around.\nThe village was quiet, cradled gently by the hills. It wasn't lavish or bustling—just simple, serene. A cool breeze drifted through the trees, the soft rustling of leaves adding to the calm. The faint scent of bread baking somewhere nearby, the distant chatter of birds, and the warm light of the early sun… it was all oddly comforting.\nWith a faint nod, she answered, \"Yes… It feels nice. Peaceful.\"\nAustin smiled and resumed walking, gently tugging her hand along. \"Then forget everything else. What matters is how you feel right now.\"\nSelner hesitated but followed.\nShe didn't know how to respond to that—because Austin wasn't like the others. Valerie always gave a certain look whenever he is near other women, a quiet warning. And Austin himself… he wasn't the kind of man to drift. He was respectful, always clear about where his loyalty stood.\nBut now, walking beside him through this sleepy little village, she felt it—something different.\nHe was kind. Steady. Present. His warmth wasn't loud, but it lingered—like sunlight brushing against your skin when you least expected it.\nAnd that—more than anything—made her nervous.\nBecause somewhere, without meaning to, a fragile hope had begun to bloom in her chest.\n\"So, what do you wanna eat?\" he asked, breaking the quiet as they stepped into the heart of the small market square.\nIt was still early. Most villagers were tucked away in their homes, starting their day. The stalls were just being set up, and the scent of fresh dough and sweet tea floated lightly in the air.\nSelner glanced around, then said with a soft smile, \"Anything warm and sweet.\"\nAustin gave her a knowing nod and let his instincts guide him.\nSoon, he stepped into a small eatery tucked between two houses. Inside, a middle-aged man was flipping chairs back onto the floor and wiping down the tables.\n\"The store's not open yet,\" the man said without looking up.\nAustin walked closer, reaching into his pouch. \"Can you make us something warm and sweet? We're travelers.\" He placed a small sack of gold on the counter.\nThe man's hands froze. He looked up, then down at the sack.\nAustin's golden hair, his quiet confidence—it was clear he wasn't an ordinary wanderer. A noble, no doubt. But still…\nThe man gave a brief nod and picked up only a few coins. \"Give me twenty minutes.\"\nAustin smiled, grateful. \"We'll be right outside.\"\nHe stepped out into the fresh air again and found Selner crouched near the edge of the road, softly laughing.\nShe was feeding a small squirrel, letting it nibble from her palm. Another one was perched on her knee, its tiny paws brushing against her sleeve.\nAustin blinked. \"It'll take a while,\" he said, walking toward her. \"But… how did it get so close to you?\"\nSquirrels and other small creatures usually didn't trust people so easily.\nSelner glanced up at him with a gentle smile. \"Maybe it sensed something… that others can't.\"\nAustin hummed, crouching beside her. \"Lucky squirrel,\" he said, watching it with interest.\nBut the moment he got closer, the tiny creature froze, then dashed behind Selner's hand, peeking at him cautiously.\nAustin raised a brow. \"Hey now… don't be like that. I'm a good guy.\" He offered a few grains, holding them out with an open palm.\nBut the squirrel took one look—and bolted, disappearing into the bushes in a flash.\nSelner couldn't help it. She laughed, covering her mouth with her hand. \"Well, he definitely didn't sense anything good from you.\"\nAustin narrowed his eyes at the bushes, deadpan. \"Ungrateful little thing.\"\nSelner's laughter softened, and for a moment, they just sat there—shoulder to shoulder, crouched close to the earth, as the morning sun rose a little higher in the sky.\nA gentle peace wrapped around them. Not forced, not loud—just quiet and real.\n\"Austin…\" Selner's voice came softly, almost unsure. \"… Are you doing all this just to thank me? Or because you feel bad for me?\"\nHer gaze dropped to the ground, fingers lightly brushing over the edge of her sleeve. Austin could sense her hesitation—how long had that question been sitting in her heart, unspoken?\nAnd honestly… he understood.\nShe had been through a lot. Yes, he was grateful for what she'd done for him. And yes, he felt a quiet anger toward those in her family who had taken her powers, leaving her here all vulnerable. But this moment… this day…\n\"It's neither of those things, actually,\" he said gently.\nSelner looked up.\n\"I brought you here because I wanted to,\" Austin continued, his voice calm, unwavering. \"You looked bored. Restless. And I figured… if I've taken the responsibility to look after you, then part of that means helping you unwind once in a while.\"\nHe offered her a small, warm smile.\n\"This isn't a favor. It's not guilt. It's just me… doing something for someone I care about.\"\nSelner's brows rose slightly. \"I'm your responsibility, huh? Do you even understand the weight of what you just said?\"\nAustin raised an eyebrow. \"Do you see me caring about just anyone?\"\nSelner didn't answer. She didn't have to.\nHer silence, paired with the faint look in her eyes, said enough.\nJust then, the restaurant owner stepped out, carrying two warm plates. \"Only had time to prepare crepes.\"\nAustin smiled and stepped forward, taking the plates with a respectful nod. \"Thank you.\"\nHe turned and handed the vanilla one to Selner.\nShe blinked, caught off guard—and then smiled softly.\nHe still remembers…\nCrepe in hand, they began walking again—no real direction, just letting the quiet roads guide them.\nThey talked about this and that—things that didn't matter, yet still filled the silence in a way that felt… peaceful.\nUntil Selner asked, \"Now that the Council is backing you and the conflict with Drenovar is resolved… when are you planning to move against the other side?\"\nAustin didn't answer right away. He took a small bite of his crepe, letting the question settle in the air.\nThen he said, \"Soon. But it's not going to be a charge of swords and fire.\"\nSelner let out a thoughtful hum. \"What do you mean?\"\nAustin's eyes stayed forward, voice calm and focused. \"I need to trigger the awakening of the three remaining Generals. And what better way to bring them back than by threatening the one they swore their lives to?\"\nSelner's eyes narrowed slightly. \"Target their Lord.\"\nAustin gave a low hum of approval. \"Exactly.\"\nHis grip on the crepe tightened just a little.\n\"I'm just waiting for the meeting between Eryndor and the Council. Once that's over… I'll be free to act.\"\nSelner didn't say anything after that.\nThey soon finished their dessert and stopped by a small lake.\nThe blue water matched the blue sky over their heads.\nThey sat silently at the bank, enjoying the weather and the silence.\n\"I never really imagined this,\" she began, \"...that I would be sitting here in peace, without a single stress over my head and enjoying my time with you.\"\nWith a smile, she added, \"The moment I helped Valerie regain her memories, I believed that was my end. They could have sent me to prison as well...but it turned out better than I expected. They are quite forgiving.\"\nAustin heaved a sigh of relief. If she had been imprisoned he wouldn't have been able to do anything.\nA moment of silence before he asked, \"Do you like this life...silent and peaceful?\"\nSelner's brows raised. That question held a deeper meaning and she understood it quite well.\nBut, for some reason, she didn't think of the consequences and just responded, \"I could kill to have this life forever.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Several important figures were currently gathered inside the conference room.\nThe leaders of Drenovar and Eryndor sat at the table, along with two Council Heads—James, a seasoned middle-aged man, and Joe, a sharp-eyed young representative.\nThis meeting had been scheduled under the guise of coincidence.\nThe King of Drenovar had come forward with a proposal for a truce, when—almost at the same time—the Council requested a separate meeting.\nOddly, the Council also insisted that Idris be present for the discussion.\nAnd that raised a troubling question:\nWas it truly a coincidence… that they approached only when Idris was here?\nNow, only one person's presence was needed.\nSebastian, standing diagonally behind Cedric, kept glancing anxiously toward the entrance.\nHis young master was making some of the most influential figures in the world wait—and it was fraying his nerves.\nBut just before the older man could lose a few more years off his life from worry, the doors finally opened.\nA familiar blond-haired boy stepped inside.\n\"Sorry for the delay,\" Austin said calmly as he walked over and took his seat—positioned between Idris and his father.\nJoe let out a sigh. \"For a moment, I thought you'd already crossed over to the other side to begin hunting.\"\nAustin gave a playful grin. \"You and I both want that to happen… but rushing it would only lead to self-destruction.\"\nJoe gave a knowing nod.\nThen Cedric cleared his throat and called the meeting to order. \"Alright then, now that everyone's here, shall we hear the reason behind this sudden gathering?\"\nIt was James who answered.\n\"I believe you're already aware of your son's recent accomplishments.\"\nCedric nodded slowly. As unbelievable as it was, he couldn't deny the truth—Austin had grown terrifyingly strong in a very short time.\nIn just a matter of days, he had taken down demons powerful enough to threaten the entire town with their armies.\nThe news had left both Cedric and Sophie stunned.\nThey didn't know what had changed in their son… but since he seemed unharmed, grounded, and still very much himself, they hadn't raised any concerns—at least, not yet.\n\"Based on his claims,\" James said, \"we've decided to grant full protection to Eryndor's capital.\"\nCedric didn't look surprised—he had already heard about it from Austin.\nWhich is why he leaned forward and asked, \"I'd like to know more about your plans. How exactly do you intend to fortify an entire capital?\"\nThe Council certainly had the quality—but not the quantity.\nTheir forces were already stretched thin, with several bases spread across the globe, each needing to be constantly manned in order to monitor sensitive zones.\nNot to mention, every Council Head operated under tight security—each one flanked by at least one A-rank or even S-rank guardian at all times.\nCedric had been curious from the start—just how much was the Council willing to offer in exchange for leveraging their son?\nHe expected negotiations, perhaps a formal alliance, maybe even a few elite soldiers.\nBut what he heard next stunned him.\n\"Apart from the four S-ranks who will accompany Master Austin,\" James said calmly, \"we will assign every available S-rank and A-rank under our command, along with two thousand soldiers, to protect Eryndor's capital.\"\n\"…\"\nCedric stared at him, speechless.\nThis was far beyond anything he had imagined.\nHe slowly turned his gaze toward his son. Just what kind of spell did you cast on them, Austin…?\nHow could the Council, known for its caution and rigid politics, show this much trust in a teenager?\nYes, the demons Austin had taken down were powerful—dangerous enough to shake nations.\nBut was that alone truly enough to warrant this level of faith?\nHe couldn't tell.\nAnd that uncertainty unsettled him.\n(A/N:- Actually, he hadn't told him that he had hunted a Demon General.)\n\"Additionally,\" James continued, \"I would like to request Lord Idris to contribute to the fortification of Eryndor. Strengthen it as much as you can. After all… the main attack force will be drawing the enemy's full attention.\"\nIdris blinked, clearly overwhelmed by the weight of this conversation. \"You mean to say… Austin is your main attack force?\"\nJoe nodded. \"Yes, Lord Idris. He will lead the team tasked with striking the enemy directly and eliminating the Demonic Generals.\"\nCedric's frown deepened. \"I was told Austin would be among the attackers, not leading them—\"\n\"F-Father,\" Austin cut in quickly, \"why don't we… talk about this later?\"\nThere was an uneasy pause.\nIn that moment, Austin felt a twinge of regret.\nValerie was right… I should have told them everything.\nHe hadn't expected the Council to act so quickly. When he returned in the evening—still basking in the afterglow of his quiet date with Selner—he'd been blindsided by the sudden notice:\nThe Council was here.\nCedric glanced sideways at his son.\nThere was no mistaking it—Austin had kept several things from him.\nBut rather than cornering him here, in front of everyone, Cedric chose to stay composed and focus on the conversation with the Council.\n\"I understand your concern,\" he said slowly. \"But Drenovar is close to the danger zone as well. Asking them to send soldiers to Eryndor might be… unfair.\"\nJames leaned back, calm and unfazed. \"I'll leave that decision to Lord Idris. But you should know—when everything starts, Eryndor will be the red-hot zone. That's where the storm will hit first.\"\nCedric stayed quiet, turning his attention to Idris, who finally spoke.\n\"If the Council believes that's where the tide will rise, then I agree—we should prioritize Eryndor,\" Idris said, his voice measured. Then, looking directly at Cedric, he added,\n\"Let me use this opportunity to return the favor… that your son has already extended to me.\"\nThe discussion progressed into more intricate matters—strategic deployment, supply chain logistics, and the long-term sustainability of stationed units.\nThey reviewed high-risk regions, highlighting fault lines where demonic activity had been recently reported. Special emphasis was placed on areas that could allow the enemies to sneak in.\nAttention shifted to the capital's surrounding districts. There was concern about evacuation routes, underground shelters, and reinforcement of key infrastructure, including communication towers and teleportation gates.\nMagical defense formations were proposed, including layered barriers and suppression fields designed to counter large-scale demonic magic. The group debated their placement—whether to concentrate them around the capital itself or spread them along the perimeter towns to create a wider defense net.\nThere were also talks about specialized forces: terrain specialists to manipulate the battlefield, summoners to maintain magical pressure, and aerial scouts to ensure no movement went unnoticed. Allocation of these forces was determined based on expected enemy behavior.\nFurther time was spent on alliance coordination—how each faction would maintain communication, handle emergencies, and pass leadership in case of casualties. There was even mention of using mana-linked communication crystals tied to key individuals across all fronts.\nThe discussion dragged on for nearly three hours before Austin was finally allowed to leave—though not before hearing his father's quiet but firm words:\n\"We need to talk after this.\"\nAustin didn't protest. He simply offered a faint smile and walked out.\nBehind him, Sebastian remained in the conference room, assisting Cedric with gathering maps and documents, arranging everything neatly for later review.\nAustin, meanwhile, headed toward the reception hall, hoping for a breath of fresh air and perhaps a moment of silence.\nBut just as he turned the corner, a familiar voice called out softly:\n\"Austin.\"\nHe looked up, surprised.\nLeaning against a pillar stood his mother, her hands loosely clasped, her eyes slightly nervous.\n\"How long have you been here?\" he asked, blinking.\n\"I've been walking around for a while now… thinking. Waiting,\" she said, not quite meeting his gaze. \"Tell me—what happened during the meeting?\"\nIt wasn't an idle question. There was tension beneath her voice.\nAnd understandably so.\nWhen the ruler of a nation long considered hostile suddenly appeared unannounced—\nAnd when the Council, of all people, responded by arranging an urgent, high-level meeting—\nIt wasn't diplomacy. It was a signal.\nSomething was coming.\nSomething dangerous.\nAustin assured her, \"Nothing is going to happen, Mom. They came here with the concern of Eryndor's security.\"\nSophie promptly asked, \"Are we going to get attacked?\"\n\"Possibly, yes. But you don't need to worry. I give you my word, mother, that I won't let anything dangerous reach you two.\" He softly embraced her, placing her head on his chest.\nHe won't let history repeat itself.\nHis priority lies in keeping his people safe.\nSophie softly asked, \"I never realised...\"\nAustin hummed in question before she parted from him, her arms on his chest as she said, \"My child has become so reliable.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Well, thanks to Valerie, I realised what I was doing wrong and what I need to do.\"\nSophie smiled, \"I owe her a lot.\"\nWhen his parents had abandoned him, that girl stood by his side all the time.\nSo yes, she couldn't thank her enough.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- We are heading toward the end.

      "content": "\"It's strange, isn't it?\" Charlotte asked, glancing at the others around the table.\nShe sat alongside the other three S-rank warriors—her temporary companions. Tomorrow, they would all be marching to the other side.\nWilliam raised an eyebrow. \"What do you mean?\"\nCharlotte leaned forward slightly, her tone thoughtful.\n\"None of the Hellstains have shown any movement lately. If anything… demon sightings have dropped.\"\nOlivia scoffed. \"Maybe they finally realized we're coming to kick their asses. Probably gathering every last bit of strength before the storm hits.\"\nThe recent reinforcement of Eryndor's border defenses had surely caught their attention. Especially after someone from Eryndor wiped out two of the most powerful figures in the demon ranks—it wouldn't take a genius to see what was coming.\nAustin let out a quiet sigh.\n\"Either they're pretending to retreat… or,\" he gestured toward Olivia, \"they're preparing for us.\"\nHe knew this pattern far too well.\nIn the previous timeline, just before he launched an offensive against the demon lands, their forces had vanished—just like now. No attacks. No scouts. Nothing.\nIt had looked like Astaroth had accepted defeat.\nBut it was a trap.\nWhile Austin was away on the frontlines, the demons struck Eryndor with everything they had.\nThat wouldn't happen this time.\nHe had already reinforced every hidden route, sealed off all the forgotten tunnels, and stationed guards in places the old Eryndor leadership had overlooked.\nEven if the demons gathered a full army, it would take them at least a day to reach the palace gates.\nSo yes—this time, Austin was ready.\n\"Should we send a scouting team to the other side?\" William suggested, breaking the brief silence.\nAustin shrugged. \"I mean, if there are people willing to sacrifice themselves, sure—go ahead.\"\nWilliam's jaw tightened at the blunt response.\nHe could send a team… but the human part of him hesitated. He didn't want to treat lives like disposable tools.This^ is p-a!rt of a s*er-ies f*rom+ My V-ir@tu+al L+ib^ra#r@y E%m%p^i-r@e (M@|-V@|@L1&E^MP^Y!R).!\nAustin didn't add anything after that. Instead, he stood up and dusted off his coat.\n\"Alright then. I'll see you later.\"\nThe meeting had already concluded.\nThey'd discussed everything—from battle formations and supply lines to the known routes on the demon side.\nAustin had been in charge of all that.\nNo one questioned how he knew so much about the terrain and structure of the other side.\nNot after seeing William lose to him.\nAustin was… different.\nAn anomaly.\nAnd over time, people had simply learned to expect the unexpected from him.\nHe stepped out of the strategy room and began walking toward his quarters.\nThey were staying in the Council Headquarters for now.\nTomorrow, they will set off for the other side.\nThat's why Austin had been summoned here in the first place.\nTo prepare.\nClick.\nAs the door opened, Austin was immediately greeted by the comforting aroma of warm bread and sizzling eggs.\nHe glanced to the left—and there she was.\nIn the small kitchen, his favorite girl moved with practiced grace. Her long violet hair flowed down her back, swaying gently with each step.\nA soft smile tugged at his lips as he walked toward her.\n\"You could've slept a bit longer,\" he murmured, wrapping his arms around her from behind.\nValerie chuckled, the sound light and familiar.\n\"I may have been exhausted last night,\" she said, \"but that doesn't mean I'd forget my discipline.\"\nAustin leaned over slightly to peek at the pan. Scrambled eggs—simple, comforting, and made with her hands.\nHe leaned in close, voice barely above a whisper.\n\"I like sweet things in the morning.\"\nValerie paused for a moment, then slowly tilted her head to the side—gracefully baring her pristine white neck to him.\nA silent invitation.\nAustin's grin deepened, and he leaned in, letting his lips brush against her warm, delicate skin.\n\"Mm… slow…\" she whispered, her eyes fluttering shut as she felt the heat of her Lord's breath, the gentle pressure of his mouth.\nHe left a faint red mark there, just enough to linger.\n\"Thanks for the meal,\" he murmured against her skin, his voice low and teasing.\nValerie's cheeks turned the same shade as the mark he'd just left, and she let out a soft huff.\n\"Now… let's have breakfast,\" she said, trying to compose herself.\nAustin chuckled and stepped back, finally showing her mercy.\nHe helped arrange the table, moving around the kitchen like he'd done this a thousand times, even though they have been living here for only a couple of days. The space was small but warm, alive with shared moments and quiet comfort. Her scent still lingered in the air—flowers and warmth, mingling with the smell of eggs and bacon.\nIt wasn't a grand meal, but it was perfect in its simplicity.\nScrambled eggs, crisp bread, a few strips of bacon, and fresh juice—familiar, fulfilling.\nThey sat down together, elbows occasionally brushing, the air between them charged yet calm.\n\"How did the meeting go?\" Valerie asked, her tone casual but her eyes searching. \"They called you in pretty early.\"\nAustin nodded, pouring her juice.\n\"They'll be heading out today—to gather supplies and meet their families one last time.\"\nA quiet weight settled in the space between them.\nValerie's heart clenched. She already knew what was coming, but his words made it feel real again.\nThis wasn't just another battle.\nIt was the beginning of the end.\nHumanity was about to face its oldest enemy…\nAnd in this war, there was no middle ground.\nOne side would survive.\nThe other… would be forgotten.\nAustin reached across the table and gently took her hand in his.\nHis fingers wrapped around hers with quiet strength.\n\"I know I can't take away your worries,\" he said softly, \"but you trust me, don't you? You know I'd never throw my life away—no matter what happens.\"\nValerie's eyes lingered on their joined hands. Her throat tightened slightly, but she gave a slow nod.\nShe did trust him.\nShe knew just how powerful he was—powerful enough that even the Demon Lord wouldn't face him directly, choosing strategy and deception over confrontation.\nBut that didn't make it easier.\nNot until this war ended.\nNot until the skies cleared… and her Lord returned to her with no more battles left to fight.\nOnly then would she truly feel at ease.\n\"Are you leaving tomorrow?\" Valerie asked, her voice calm but a little too careful.\nShe was trying to shift the mood.\nTrying to steady herself—because she knew her emotions affected him more than he let on.\nShe couldn't afford to be his weakness. Not now.\n\"Yes,\" Austin replied, nodding slightly. \"A few of the Council Heads will arrive in the evening to give their usual motivational speech. I'll use that time to visit Mom and Dad.\"\nHe let out a quiet breath, already anticipating the difficulty of that meeting.\nThe last time he saw them, their eyes were heavy with worry.\nAnd now… learning that their son would be leading the strike force to the other side?\nIt would only deepen that concern.\nBut it was something he had to do.\n\"Is there really no chance I could come with you?\" Valerie asked softly.\nShe hadn't asked before—not once.\nBut deep down, she'd been waiting for him to bring it up.\nAnd yet, he never did.\nAustin set his fork down, his eyes meeting hers with quiet resolve.\n\"Your role is far more important, Val,\" he said. \"I'm entrusting our family to you. I can't trust anyone else with their safety.\"\nThe violet-haired woman slowly nodded, the words sinking in.\n\"I understand. I'll stay close to them.\"\nAustin offered a faint smile, though it didn't reach his eyes.\nHe knew she must've wanted to stand beside him.\nAnd a part of him wanted that too.\nBut if she were there… he'd be distracted. Always glancing back, always wondering if she was safe—even when she could handle herself.\nHe needed to be ruthless over there. Unshaken. Focused.\nThe rest of breakfast passed mostly in silence.\nA quiet, heavy silence—but not uncomfortable.\nThey were simply giving each other the space to process what was coming.\nAustin spent the rest of the day with Valerie, wandering the palace halls, exchanging light banter, and flirting every chance he got.\nHe was doing everything he could to leave a little peace in her heart.\nBy evening, a message was sent out—everyone was to gather in the front garden of the headquarters.\nAustin, however, slipped away with a quiet excuse. He had somewhere far more important to be.\nIt took him less than half an hour to arrive at the palace.\nAnd there, waiting, were his parents.\nBoth his and Valerie's families were currently staying within the royal grounds—an extra measure of security. Rudolph and his family had returned to the capital as well, and when Austin had warned him of the looming threat, Rudolph hadn't wasted a second.\nHe brought Rhea with him… and naturally, that led to her calling Parkinson too.\nEveryone important was now here.\nAs Austin walked towards the palace, he heard Valerie saying, \"You are going to have a hard time explaining things to them.\"\nAustin chuckled, \"Well, it can't be that difficult…right?\"\nA melodious laughter echoed as the duo stepped inside.\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "\"Everything checked?\" William asked as he glanced back at his squad.\nOlivia gave a nod, and Charlotte was still tightening the strap of her bag around her waist.\n\"Mind telling me why I was suddenly dragged into this whole mess?\" asked a certain green-haired mage.\nWilliam gave a casual shrug. \"Well, there's no denying that you're a valuable asset to humanity. But right now, your skills are needed on the battlefield.\"\nThea had been added to the team at the last moment. When it came to versatility and escaping tight situations, no one was better than the mage who could create copies of herself.\n\"We needed a porter,\" came a voice from the left, and Thea immediately felt the urge to murder the speaker.\nOlivia chuckled while Charlotte shook her head in exasperation. \"Seriously, you have a talent for pissing people off.\"\nAustin grinned. \"Come on, what's better than having her clones carry our supplies?\"\nA vein throbbed on Thea's forehead as she glared at William. \"I swear, if you brought me just for—\"\n\"No, Thea. He's just messing with you,\" William cut in, holding up a hand. \"Austin has a storage artifact with him. All our supplies are already stored. You don't need to worry.\"\nThea huffed. \"Then take mine too, cocky brat.\"\nShe tossed her bag at Austin, who caught it easily and slid it into the inventory with a smirk.\nSoon after, the golden-haired warrior stood and turned to face the group. They were near the shore now, ready to deploy.\nWilliam's gaze swept over his squad. \"This came out of nowhere,\" he said quietly. \"I won't lie—we weren't ready for this. We thought we'd be facing our arch-nemesis much later.\"\nAustin heaved a quiet sigh. Of course, no one could've predicted they'd be facing the Demon Lord so suddenly.\nThis content originates from M1VLEMPYR, My Virtual Library Empire.\nWhile everyone looked ready to meet whatever end awaited them in this war, he didn't miss the subtle signs of tension.\nCharlotte kept her hands constantly moving, trying to hide her fidgeting. Olivia was chewing on a small piece of metal again—her usual habit to calm her nerves.\n\"But… isn't this what we trained for?\" William finally said, breaking the silence. \"I know for a fact—the reason I picked up a sword was to slay that plague named Astaroth.\"\nOlivia snorted. \"Anyone who became a warrior for any other reason is either a lunatic or a plain murderer.\"\nWilliam hummed thoughtfully. \"So… no matter how nervous we might feel, I know this mission is for the sake of those we love. Be brave, and march with me to the other side. There are beings that need to be wiped out.\"\nOne by one, everyone began to rise.\nAustin could feel it—William's presence had a powerful effect on the team. Even he felt the pull, the sudden rush of determination, as if they were part of some epic scene in a movie.\nNot long after, they stepped out of the tent and onto the small boat that would carry them to the other side.\nA boatman stood waiting, ready to use his Shard to guide the vessel across. They had chosen a small boat to keep their arrival quiet and as undetectable as possible.\nOf course, Austin had no doubt the enemy already knew they were coming—but hey, whatever floats their boat.\n\"Shall we head out, Sir Torus?\" William asked.\nThe boatman gave a slow nod, his face pale with worry.\nCharlotte approached him calmly. \"Don't worry, mister. As I promised, I'll raise a barrier on your way back. It'll hold until you're out of their range.\"\nThe boatman gave her a grateful look. \"Thank you for your kindness.\"\nAustin sat at the far edge of the boat and pulled out the pouch of cookies Valerie had packed for him.\nAs he munched on the sweet, crumbly treats, he asked the system, 'Do you believe I'll fail?'\n[If it's just the Demon Lord and his underlings, the current host has no chance of losing.]\nAustin hummed. 'That sounds like I'm stroking my ego…'\n[…More like you're being cautious. On the surface, you seem confident—but your heart rate tells a different story.]\nAustin let out a chuckle. 'Well, can you blame me? This mission decides whether leaping through time actually changes our fate… or not.'\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the boat, Thea narrowed her eyes as she watched Austin chuckling to himself.\n\"Is that guy sane,\" she whispered to Charlotte, \"or did he trade his mind for power?\"\nCharlotte shook her head, \"He often talks to himself, ignore that. What we should care about is his desperation to eradicate the demon race and his strength.\"\nThea hummed thoughtfully. She had already heard about Austin's duel with William, but a part of her still couldn't wrap her head around it. Was it really possible that a mere seventeen-year-old could make someone like William yield?\nShe had fought William once before. It was under the scorching sun, and she could still remember how terrifying he felt. Back then, she had lost all hope of surviving the moment their weapons clashed. His presence alone was overwhelming—like a wall that couldn't be climbed.\nAnd yet, Austin had faced that same William in broad daylight... and won.\nThat alone made her curious. Maybe too curious.\nSo, without much thought, she casually flicked a knife at his stomach.\nThe throw was so smooth—so clean—that even Charlotte didn't notice. The knife zipped through the air in an instant.\n\"You know,\" Austin sighed as he caught the knife between two fingers, barely looking up, \"...this is really not a great way to bond with your teammates.\"\nThe others turned their heads just in time to see the knife in Austin's hand.\nOlivia lost interest almost immediately. Since Austin didn't seem even remotely bothered or willing to retaliate, it wasn't fun for her. William, on the other hand, simply shook his head with a faint sigh of disbelief.\n\"Thea… that wasn't nice, you know,\" Charlotte scolded, her tone a mix of irritation and worry.\nThea shrugged carelessly. \"I was helping him train his reflexes. No need to thank me, bud.\"\nAustin rolled his eyes and, without saying anything else, tossed the knife far into the ocean. It spun through the air before vanishing into the waves with a soft splash.\nThe rest of their journey passed in silence after that.\nEventually, the boarman brought the boat to the opposite shore.\nAs promised, Charlotte kept her barrier intact until she was sure he had traveled far enough away after dropping them off. Only when he was barely a dot in the distance did she finally lower the shield around the boat.\nOnce it was done, Olivia stepped forward, eyes glinting with impatience. \"Shall we proceed?\" she asked, almost licking her lips in anticipation.\nAustin raised a hand, his expression now serious. \"Wait. Let me check the area first.\"\nThen, without another word, he leapt forward—soaring over the small hill that marked the edge of the shore in a single, effortless jump.\nOlivia growled lowly. \"He could have let us come with him.\"\nWilliam shook his head. \"Scouting should always be done by one person. If there's danger, fewer lives are at risk.\"\nAustin wasn't just checking for enemies.\nHe was looking for signs of the acid rain.\nIn their last journey through this realm, the rain had turned into one of the biggest threats. They couldn't even fight properly—because the S-rank warriors were too busy shielding themselves instead of attacking.\nBack then, Rhea had found and killed the demon spellcaster responsible for controlling the weather here. But this time... things were different.\nAustin was sure that Astaroth—who also retained the memories of the previous timeline—wouldn't leave that same demon in the same spot.\nSo, there was no point in trying to track it down again.\n'Haa... at least the sky looks clear.' Austin exhaled slowly as he observed the dark clouds above. There was no sign of that skin-melting rain—for now.\nHe turned around and headed back to the group.\n\"The coast is clear,\" he announced calmly. \"We can move ahead.\"\nWilliam gave a firm nod before leaping forward. The others followed right behind him.\n\"Ah—!\" Charlotte suddenly cried out as she missed her footing and slipped mid-jump.\nBut before she could fall, William reached out and caught her in his arms.\nHer chest rose and fell rapidly as she tried to catch her breath. \"T-Thanks...\" she murmured, a little embarrassed.\nWilliam gave her a quiet nod and gently pulled her up to her feet.\nAustin, meanwhile, pulled out a rolled-up map from his satchel and spread it open.\n\"Our destination lies to the north,\" he said, pointing at the top of the parchment. \"But we can't head straight there just yet.\"\nHe tapped two red crosses on either side of a palace sketched in the middle.\n\"First, we need to clear these two outposts—left and right. They're guarding the main road.\"\nOlivia leaned over and raised a brow.\n\"So we split?\"",

      "content": "\"KHIEEEK\" The goblin screeched as two blades flew past its throat, missing the mark.\nBut a clone of the thrower appeared behind it, caught the knives mid-air, and drove them into its skull.\n\"Just die already!\" Thea growled, pinning the creature down and slamming it to the ground until it stopped moving.\nShe exhaled and got to her feet, glancing around.\nA hundred goblins, all wiped out within minutes—a feat worth recording in her diary.\n\"I should help him,\" she muttered and headed outside, thinking Austin might be in trouble.\nBut the scene that met her eyes left her stunned.\nA pile of bones lay ahead, and at the top sat the cocky Prince who was supposed to be struggling against the bloodhounds.\n\"Something's off,\" Austin said as he jumped down. \"This was way too easy.\"\nThea raised an eyebrow. \"I just took down a hundred demonic creatures, and you call this easy?\"\nAustin looked at her. \"Do you really think they'd assign goblins to guard the imperial palace?\"\nShe shrugged. \"Maybe they're short on people?\"\n\"Exactly. And I wonder why that is.\" Austin replied.\nDemons multiplied like insects. There was no reason for their forces to be lacking.\n\"Well, let's regroup for now,\" Austin said, offering her a small vial.\nThea blinked as she took it. \"A healing potion? These are rare… where did you even get one?\"\nAustin shook his head. \"Doesn't matter. Just use it.\"\nShe always knew when to joke and when to stay serious—and right now, the mission came first.\nWithout hesitation, she drank the potion. The cuts on her face and abdomen hissed before fading away.\nWordlessly, they hurried toward the rendezvous point.\n\"They're not here yet…\" Thea said, scanning the empty area.\n\"Think they ran into trouble?\" she asked.\n\"If they did, they'd send a signal. Let's wait,\" Austin replied, sweeping his gaze across the landscape.\nDust hung in the air. The ground was dry. No movement. No presence. Nothing.\nThat was enough to raise his guard.\n'System, anything you can detect?'\n[Apologies, host. The system's perception is mostly limited to your own range.]\n'Figured. We'll know more once we meet them,' he thought, having already calculated most possible scenarios. He had accounted for everything Astaroth could do in his current state.\nNot long after, he heard footsteps.\n\"They're here.\"\nTurning, he saw the three familiar figures approaching. They were wounded—mainly Olivia—but nothing severe.\nAustin pulled out three potions from the 'Shop' and handed them over.\n\"Nothing too serious, I assume?\"\nCharlotte's eyes widened. \"We fought griffons!\"\nAustin shrugged. \"Griffons are like guard dogs around here. Nothing too dangerous, I assume.\"\nThe barrier user stared at him in disbelief. That \"dog\" had nearly torn her head off.\n\"Char, it's okay. You're safe now,\" William said gently, patting her back.\nOlivia finished her potion, then asked, \"So… you're saying they're inviting us?\"\n\"Could be,\" Austin replied, eyes fixed on the northern horizon. \"We'll know soon enough.\"\n\"We're heading out already?\" Thea asked. She didn't hesitate, but the nerves in her voice were clear.\nThey all knew what waited ahead.\nThe castle of humanity's greatest enemy.\nThe same being who once ruled over them a thousand years ago.\n\"If any of you are having second thoughts—\" Austin began, but Olivia cut him off.\n\"Bah! We've already had that talk. Let's just go!\" she said, striding ahead without pause.\nAustin let out a quiet sigh, shaking his head.\nWilliam stepped up, placed a hand on Austin's shoulder, and gave a firm nod.\nAustin returned the gesture.\nAnd with that, the five of them moved forward.\nIt was time.\n….\nThe atmosphere grew heavy as the towering castle finally came into view, its peaks touching the sky.\nIts dark, ominous shade mirrored the soul of the being that dwelt within.\n\"What are the chances the Demon Lord has already moved?\" Thea asked casually.\nAccording to what Austin had told them, the Demon Lord was still too damaged to go anywhere. He was recovering inside a containment cylinder—making it easy to reach him.\nBut killing him would achieve nothing. He could simply transfer his soul into another vessel.\nTo truly destroy him, he had to fully assimilate the final fragment of his soul.\nThat's why they were here—not to kill him, but to break him.\nTo provoke his General into showing up.\nAustin wasn't here for revenge. He was here to clean up the mess, piece by piece.\nHis hatred for Astaroth wouldn't get him far.\nHe needed to stay rational—and tear that monster apart, slowly.\n\"What… the fuck?\" Olivia muttered, stunned as the castle's massive entrance creaked open on its own.\nNo demons in sight. No traps that Austin could detect.\nIt was just… open.\n\"Austin… are we sure about this?\" Charlotte asked, her voice uncertain.\n\"We don't have another choice,\" the blond prince replied, his eyes locked on the open gate.\nWithout a word, William summoned his Shard. The others followed suit.\nAustin took the lead, with Thea watching their rear.\nOlivia moved to the left flank, William to the right, and Charlotte stayed at the center—ready to raise a barrier if anything struck without warning.\nThey moved cautiously through the castle—and once again, found nothing.\nEven Austin was starting to doubt.\nHad Astaroth fled? Had he, despite his pride, dug a hole and crawled into hiding?\nBut those thoughts vanished the moment a familiar voice echoed through the halls.\n\"Isn't it about time you show your face?\"\nAustin didn't say a word. He shot forward without hesitation.CheckforthelatestupdatesonMyVirtualLibraryEmpire(M-VL-EMP-YR).\nThe others followed close behind.\nThey moved swiftly through the vast hallway, turning left at the bend that led to the throne room.\nOne by one, they stepped into the grand hall—its floor marked by a large, circular pattern like a ritual ring.\n\"Welcome, warrior.\"\nThe booming voice of the Demon Lord echoed through the grand hall.\nAll eyes turned to the raised throne at the far end of the room.\nAustin's gaze darkened at the sight of the being who, by all logic, shouldn't have been whole again.\nBut he was.\nLong, flowing white hair. Piercing red eyes. Elongated arms. A presence so overwhelming it made Charlotte gasp and stagger back.\nAustin stepped forward, voice sharp.\n\"How did you do it? You've gathered all the fragments of your soul… how?\"\nIt shouldn't have been possible.\nAustin's former self had nearly destroyed him. Even if Astaroth survived, it should've taken years to assimilate the fourth fragment.\nSo how...?\n\"Kuku~ I love that look on your face,\" Astaroth chuckled, lounging back in his throne.\n\"All your plans… undone in an instant.\"\nHe laughed, savoring the shock on Austin's face.\nThen, leaning forward on his throne, those blood-red eyes bore down on him.\nThe air around them grew heavier—almost suffocating. A pressure so thick it pressed into their skin, coiling into their minds.\nThea staggered back, nearly falling.\nA primal fear clawed at her chest. Her instincts screamed.\nThis isn't what we came for.\nThis isn't the fight we prepared for.\n\"We need to—\" she turned to run—\nOnly to find the exit gone.\nThe entrance had vanished, replaced by a solid wall of black stone, etched with demonic runes that pulsed faintly.\nThey were trapped.\nAnd the realization hit all of them at once.\nAstaroth grinned, finally answering Austin's unspoken question.\n\"They couldn't protect me…\" he said with a low growl, \"…but surely, they could lend my soul a little push, don't you think?\"\nAustin's eyes widened in disbelief.\n\"You… got help from those pigeons?!\"\nThe Immortals.\nThose lofty, untouchable beings who claimed to be beyond good and evil—who never interfered.\nThey had helped him.\nThey had restored Astaroth's soul. Returned him to what he once was.\nTo his full strength… the very same terrifying power that had ruled over humanity a thousand years ago.\n\"Fuck.\"\n\"Gahahahaha!\" Astaroth's laughter tore through the palace, rattling the stained glass, making dust rain from the ceiling.\nThe ground trembled beneath their feet.\nEven William, ever composed, bent his knees and gritted his teeth just to stay upright.\nCharlotte instinctively raised a barrier around them—but it cracked instantly under the sheer pressure radiating from the throne.\nAustin clenched his fists, the cold fury in his chest rising with each beat of his heart.\n\"This wasn't supposed to happen,\" Olivia muttered under her breath, clutching her fists tightly.\nAustin ground his teeth. Those assholes interfered with the mortal realm just to keep their word!\nAstaroth suddenly snapped his finger and the ring on the floor turned red.\n\"Huh?\" Charlotte gasped as her Shard suddenly disappeared.\nThe same goes for William and Olivia.\nTheir Shard dissolved to nothingness and suddenly they felt their legs trembling.\nAustin took a deep breath as he realized what this was.\n\"You remember this, right? The Circle of Doom. Now, all we can do is use our fists.\"\nAstaroth said as he stepped down from his throne, slowly.\n\"You know there is another Circle like this, drawn somewhere in the world. Currently, blocking the magic around that area so no one could escape using Teleportation or other means.\"\n\"...!!\" Austin's eyes widened.\n…It can't be.\nAstaroth growled, \"You thought I would spare your family, your woman after what you made me go through?\"\n\"They are all going to die, warrior. And you would be only left alive for long enough to bury their cold bodies!\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website.

      "content": "\"This is a messed-up situation,\" Selner muttered under her breath.\nValerie caught it. She turned sharply to the older woman, her brows drawn. \"What situation?\"\nSelner didn't answer right away. She had been pacing for quite some time now, her arms folded tightly across her chest, as though trying to contain a storm within.\nThe moment Austin had crossed the border, chaos had followed. Eryndor came under siege almost instantly.\nDemonic forces descended from every direction like a flood unleashed.\nIf not for the foresight Austin had shown—placing the Council's troops and Drenovar's soldiers near the capital—the palace would've been in ruins already.\nThe defenses were stretched thin. Thousands of high-tier demons swarmed the outer provinces, pressing inward with unnatural speed. No rest. No mercy. The tide was unrelenting.\nBut what truly made Selner's blood run cold wasn't the numbers.\nIt was who led them.\n\"The Demonic Generals,\" she said, her voice low, haunted. \"They're here.\"\nValerie's eyes widened, her face stiffening. \"Are you sure?\"\nSelner nodded grimly. \"I saw them myself. The Orc Lord. The Parasite Chief. They're out there right now, tearing through our lines on the eastern and northeastern fronts. Coordinating like they always does. Our forces are barely holding.\"\nFor a moment, silence reigned. Valerie stood frozen, her knuckles white around the handle of the chair.. It was too soon. Far too soon for the Generals to be unleashed.\nTheir revival depended entirely on Astaroth's strength.\nAnd if they were already here, that could only mean one thing—\n\"The Demon Lord's… revived?\" she whispered, her voice faltering.\nSelner's frown deepened. \"That's what I'm starting to believe. But I don't understand how. He was broken. Shattered after what Austin did to him. He shouldn't be able to recover—not this quickly.\"\nThe memory of that final battle still lingered in her mind—Austin standing tall in the aftermath, the Demon Lord reduced to ash and silence. Yet now, the ground trembled once more. The sky burned with crimson veins.\nThe violence outside was the proof that the dark lord had returned.\nBOOOOOM\nAn explosion thundered from the forest to the north. The impact shook the palace foundations.\nValerie's expression turned sharp.\nWithout a word, she summoned her Shard..\nWith a quick step forward, she slammed its base against the ground. In the blink of an eye, ice erupted from beneath her feet.\nThick, jagged walls of crystal-blue ice soared up around the palace like fangs, forming another fortified barrier.\nSelner glanced at her, then nodded once. \"Stay with your family.\"\nValerie didn't argue. She turned and ran down the corridor toward the secured chamber where her and Austin's parents had been taken.\n\"Val!\" her mother cried out the moment she entered.\nThe others also turned towards the violette who held her mother close in her arms.\n\"I'm here,\" Valerie said, pulling her mother into a firm embrace. \"Everything's fine. We're just tightening defenses.\"\nShe said it with calm resolve, but her heart was pounding like a war drum.\nCedric slowly approached her and asked, \"What's the situation?\"\nValerie hesitated for a moment before revealing, \"The enemy forces are far more vast than what we were expecting.\"\nSophie's expression turned grim as she asked, \"Should we evacuate?\"\nShe would have said yes under normal circumstances, but following her Lord's words, she said,\n\"Let's stay here and wait for Austin.\"\nOutside, Selner stepped beyond the palace gates and landed atop one of the newly risen ice pillars. From that vantage point, she saw the battle beyond the walls—flashes of fire, roars of monsters, flurries of steel and magic.\nThey were still holding the capital. Barely.\nBut the question clawed at her mind.\nHow much longer?\nThen came a voice.\n\"Isn't it fruitless?\"\nA chill danced down her spine. The voice was smooth, yet heavy. Familiar.\nShe turned, eyes snapping upward.\nAnd there he was.\nDescending slowly from the sky, arms folded.\nLong, elegant ears. Deep obsidian skin. Silver-gray hair flowing like silk. And eyes—red as blood, glowing like coals.\nSelner's breath caught.\n\"Zephyr…\" she muttered, her entire stance shifting.\nThe Elven King. The most cunning and deadly of Astaroth's generals. Thought to awaken only when his master had fully returned.\nWhich could only mean…\n\"Astaroth has awakened all the fragments of his soul,\" she whispered, horrified.\nZephyr hovered before her, amused. \"Smart woman.\"\nHe looked relaxed. Dangerous.\nHe has not awoken prematurely. He stood complete. The strong General whom Kane had a hard time dealing with.\n\"They left you here to guard the palace?\" he asked, his lips curling into a faint grin. \"Tell me—\"\nHis tone dropped, laced with disdain.\n\"Do you really think you're strong enough for that?\"\nSelner didn't answer.\nTruth was—she wasn't. Not against him. Neither was Valerie.\nBut she had to stall. Somehow.\nHer hand twitched, preparing to activate teleportation—to get inside, warn the others, maybe even bring them to another safe spot.\nHowever,\n\"Huh?\" she blinked.\nNo effect.\nShe tried again.\nStill nothing.\nA hollow dread settled in her gut.\nShe couldn't use magic.\n\"You sure have become dumb after losing your title as Witch,\" Zephyr chuckled, shaking his head. \"From this moment on, this entire palace exists within my Lord's domain. No spell, no chant, no gate shall work.\"\nHe tilted his head, voice almost playful.\n\"So no more escaping now.\"\n….\nMeanwhile, deep inside the throne room—\nCRAAACK\nAstaroth hurled Austin through a thick stone pillar. The impact shattered it, stone dust blasting outward.\nAustin rolled across the marble floor, gasping, blood running from the side of his mouth. His muscles screamed.\n\"You're still standing,\" Astaroth said, striding forward slowly.\nEach footstep echoed.\nHe loomed—taller than before, monstrous in presence. Black horns twisted up from his temples, and crimson flames danced along his arms like living snakes.\nAnd he was smiling.\nProudly.\n\"I hoped you wouldn't disappoint.\"\nAustin wiped his mouth. Eyes sharp, mind racing. He wasn't defending himself properly because his mind was occupied with something else.\nOne might say, what could be more important than dealing with the greatest nemesis of humanity? Well, for him, it was the safety of his family.\nHe caught Astaroth moving.\nCLANG!\nTheir weapons clashed—Austin's sword against the blazing gauntlet.\nThe heat sizzled the air, warping it. Astaroth shoved forward, sending him skidding across the floor again.\nHe hit the wall hard. Pain lanced through his back.\nHis breathing was slightly ragged now.\nHe raised a hand and summoned Wisp.\nAstaroth raised an eyebrow. \"Oh? What kind of toy is that?\"\nHe wasn't worried. Not in the slightest.\nBut Austin wasn't talking.\n'System…' he called silently.\n[Processing…]\nAustin took to the air in a short leap, spun once, and hurled the boomerang with all the strength he had left.\nAstaroth's pupils dilated. He tracked it.\nThen—\nBOOOOOOOM\nThe explosion rocked the throne room.\nSmoke billowed.\nAstaroth flew through the chamber like a cannonball, crashing into the throne with a violent thud.\nCharlotte, watching from behind the wreckage, stared wide-eyed.\nFor the first time—\nAstaroth was injured.\nHe stood up, laughing softly.\nBlood ran down his lip. He licked it away with a satisfied growl. \"This… this is pleasure. The pain… ahh, it has been too long since I felt alive.\"\nAustin said nothing. His eyes never left the system panel.\nAstaroth stepped forward, brushing dust from his shoulders.\n\"What are you waiting for?\" he asked, voice smooth as ever. \"To hear your parents are dead?\"\nStill no answer.\n\"You actually trust that bitch Selner?\" he asked, taunting. \"You think she can protect anyone? She's probably dead already.\"\nNothing.\nNot even a blink.\nAstaroth's smile began to fade. This silence—it irked him.\n\"You dare ignore me?\"\nHe vanished.\nA flash of black fire streaked across the throne room.\nWilliam, running toward them, cursed. \"Austin—!\"\nBut it was too late.\nAstaroth's elongated claw came within inches of Austin's chest.\nThen—\n[Ding!]\n[Creation successful!]\n[Previously enlisted people will now be transferred to the dungeon.]\nAustin smiled faintly.\nHe raised his gaze.\n\"Now it's time to sleep.\"\nAstaroth's senses screamed as he suddenly twisted in the air and barely pulled himself away.\nThe room glowed brighter, the runes around the floor were resisting the magic Austin was trying to use.\n\"It's futile! You can't break-\"\n*Clang*\nAstaroth was left stunned.\nAustin's whole presence was covered in darkness.\nMagic flowed out like waves, covering the whole castle like a tsunami.\nCharlotte instantly pulled barrier around them but it wasn't needed.\nThe aura of the Prince didn't struck them…yet it made the air feel heavy.\nAstaroth growled, \"You can't risk this, warrior. Your parents' life is on the line.\"\nAustin laughed, a hearty laugh that sounded ominous even to his comrades.\n\"Fuck man, how delusional you are?\" Austin calmly stepped forward and rested his hand on Astaroth's shoulder, \"Why don't you ask your beloved General, if he reached my parents or not?\"\nAstaroth's eyes narrowed as he mentally sent the signal.\nBut he never expected the response to be so quick,\n[They disappeared, my Lord! All of them, including the witch!]\nAstaroth's eyes widened.\nAustin tilted his head as he whispered, \"Now sleep~\"\nAstaroth never had the time to move before darkness overwhelmed them.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "How could he not have planned for this?\nAustin wasn't reckless.\nNot this time.\nHe knew anything could happen—because this wasn't the first time he was facing Astaroth.\nHe wasn't the only one who carried memories from the last timeline.\nAstaroth did too.\nAnd that made the threat even worse.\nSo, Austin planned.\nHe went over every single possibility, even the ones that seemed impossible. And he prepared for all of them.\nBecause this time, he refused to lose anyone.\nHe had already paid the price once.\nNot again.\nThanks to all his preparation, the people he cared about—his friends, his family and his wife—were now safe. Hidden far away in a system-created artificial dungeon. Somewhere not even a Demon Lord could reach.\nNow, Austin could finally face the root of this chaos.\nHe could finally face him.\nThe plague named Astaroth.\n---\n\"Where the hell am I?!\" the Demon Lord bellowed, his voice echoing across the black void.\nHe looked around—only to find endless darkness. No floor. No walls. No sky.\nJust a strange nothingness that pressed down on him.\nHe growled, trying to use his power to break free of whatever illusion this was.\nBut nothing worked.\nHe couldn't sense his generals. Couldn't break space. Couldn't tear through it like before.\nThen—\nA calm voice came from behind.\n\"It's my world, Astaroth.\"\nAstaroth spun around.\nAnd there he was.\nAustin.\nCalm. Still. Unshaken.\nThe warrior who had trapped him here.\n\"You…\" Astaroth snarled. \"Where did you pull me to? What is this cursed place?\"\nAustin met his gaze without fear. \"We're inside my consciousness,\" he replied.\n\"My mind. My world. A space I created just for you.\"\nAstaroth's eyes narrowed. \"What nonsense—\"\nAustin went on, his voice quiet, but steady.\n\"There's no beginning here. No end. No way out. Only silence… and pain.\"\nAs soon as the words left his mouth, the air around Astaroth shifted.\nSomething unseen moved beneath the darkness.\nSuddenly, *CRACK!*\nA sharp spike burst from the ground, aiming straight at the demon's heart.\nAstaroth leapt to the side—barely avoiding it.\nThen another shot out.\nAnd another.\nAnd another.\nHis body moved fast—dodging the second, flipping over the third, twisting to avoid the fifth.\nBut then—\n\"Khuk!\"\nThe seventh caught him off guard.\nThen the eighth.\nThen the ninth.\nGlowing spikes pierced his skin, stabbing through his shoulders and thighs.\nHe floated mid-air now—helpless, his body locked in place by the burning pain.\nAstaroth growled, blood dripping from his mouth. \"This… won't kill me.\"\nAustin stepped forward, his footsteps echoing in the void like quiet drums.\n\"That was never the plan,\" he said, shrugging.\n\"If I wanted to kill you, Astaroth, I would've done it the moment I saw you.\"\nHe stopped a few steps away from the wounded Demon Lord. His eyes cold.\n\"My goals are… darker than that.\"\nAstaroth's breath came in rough bursts, but he still sneered. \"Torture, is it? You think pain can break me?\"\nAustin's voice lowered.\n\"This isn't pain.\"\nHe leaned in slightly.\n\"This… is fun.\"\nAstaroth flinched—not from fear, but from something else. A strange pressure in the air. He could feel it crawling under his skin.\nAustin raised his hand.\nThe space around them shivered.\n\"Welcome to your cage, Astaroth. There's no door. No escape. Only you, and every regret that ever burned this world.\"\nAs his words faded, the void began to shift again.\nVoices echoed. Screams. Cries.\nFaces appeared in the shadows.\nPeople Astaroth had killed.\nCities he had burned.\nHis sins, staring back at him.\nEndless.\nAustin stepped back, turning his back to the monster.\n\"I'll stand here,\" he said calmly. \"...watch you go through everything you have 'achieved'.\"\nAnd then—\nHe was gone from his sight.\nLeaving Astaroth to hang in the dark…\nWith the weight of his crimes, and the torment just beginning.\n….\n\"What is this?\" Olivia asked, her voice low with awe as she stared at the floating black orb in front of them.\nThe thing pulsed faintly, like a heart made of darkness.\n\"I have no clue,\" Thea replied, eyes narrowed, \"but I'm sure of one thing—Austin and the Demon Lord are inside that thing.\"\nEven saying it out loud sounded ridiculous to her.\nHow the hell did that kid trap the Demon Lord?\nShe didn't know. But somehow… it was happening.\n\"I don't know, but I—\" William started to speak, only to stop mid-sentence as a voice rang out:\n[Notice.]\nEveryone flinched.\n\"What the—?\"\n\"Where did that voice come from?!\"\nThey looked around, weapons raised, eyes sharp—but there was no source.\nNo speaker.\nNo direction.\nJust a voice, cold and mechanical, coming from nowhere and everywhere at once.\nThen it spoke again:\n[The Host is currently going through an evolution. Please maintain a safe distance from the cocoon for your safety.]\nA heavy silence followed.\n\"…Host?\" Charlotte asked, her brows furrowed. \"Is it talking about Austin?\"\n\"Possibly,\" William said, slowly nodding. His gaze never left the black orb. \"I can feel his energy. It's rising… fast. Too fast.\"\nAnd it wasn't just strong—it was changing.\nWhat pulsed from inside that cocoon wasn't the same power they'd known before.\nIt was deeper. Wilder. Something ancient hidden inside was beginning to stir.\n\"For now, we should keep our distance and wait for him to come back.\"\n….\n\"What is this place?\" Cedric asked, glancing around with furrowed brows.\nHis voice was quiet—but tense.\nEveryone around him stood still, their eyes fixed ahead.\nNo one spoke.\nBecause in front of them, just beyond the shimmering barrier, stood hundreds of Giants. Towering, monstrous, and ready to strike the moment the shield fell.\nA single crack in the defense—and it would be war.\nValerie turned, scanning the gathered crowd quickly.\nRudolph and his family were safe. Rhea was close by.\nHer own parents were here too—her mother leaning against her father's shoulder for support.\nThe King and Queen stood in front of them, calm but guarded. At their side were a few loyal servants, including Sebastian and Robert.\nAnd right beside her—stood her teacher. Steady as ever.\nA deep breath left her lips.\nThey were alive. All of them.\nShe stepped forward and spoke clearly, so everyone could hear:\n\"We're safe.\"\nHeads turned.\n\"This place belongs to Austin,\" she explained. \"He built it as a backup… in case everything went wrong.\"\nHer words settled over the crowd like a blanket of calm.\nSome sighed in relief. Others lowered their weapons just slightly.\nBut even as the tension faded, the weight of the moment remained.\nSebastian took a step forward and asked, \"If I'm not mistaken… didn't Young Master used to come here to train, Miss Valerie?\"\nHis voice carried a note of wonder.\nFor the longest time, he had watched Austin grow stronger at an unnatural pace. Faster. Sharper. Beyond reason.\nAnd now, standing in this strange world, he finally understood why.\nValerie gave a small nod.\nSebastian's lips curved into a smile, and the pieces in his mind fell into place.\n[Ding!]\nA crisp sound echoed in the air.\nThen, a voice followed—cold, mechanical, and impossible to track:\n[This is an artificial dungeon prepared by the system. Time flows differently here. Rest assured, the barrier surrounding you will never vanish.]\nGasps and whispers filled the space.\nRhea tilted her head in confusion. \"Why does none of this make any sense…?\"\nSelner let out a long, tired sigh. Her face showed just how much she had been holding back.\n\"Just be thankful you're still breathing,\" she said bluntly. \"The Demonic Generals are hunting us—everyone close to Austin is a target.\"\nRhea froze.\nSo did many others.\nThe weight of those words was heavy.\nSilence fell over the group.\n\"Where is Austin? Is he safe?\" Sophie asked, her voice shaky with worry.\nValerie stepped closer too, unable to hide the concern in her eyes.\nA moment passed in silence.\nThen the system's voice returned, calm and unwavering:\n[The Host has successfully trapped the Demon Lord. He is currently making him realize the mistakes he has committed.]\nThat brought a bit of relief—but not enough.\nThe Queen stepped forward, her voice trembling, \"H-He is safe, right?\"\nAnother pause.\nThen—\n[Indeed, he is, mother.]\nThe Queen blinked. \"M-Mother?\"\nThe voice replied gently:\n[The Host declared me as his little sister. Can I not call you mother?]\nSophie's lips parted, taken aback by the sudden warmth in those words.\nIt felt strange… but comforting.\nShe gave a soft smile and nodded slowly. \"Yes, you can. Um… can I see you?\"\nThere was silence again.\nThen:\n[I do not have a true form, mother. But… I can appear like this.]\nThe air shimmered.\nSoft gasps spread through the crowd as dozens of golden orbs appeared before Sophie, floating gently in the air like stars.\nThey glowed with a warm light, dancing slowly around her.\nSome people stepped back, surprised.\nOthers stood frozen, staring in awe.\nBut Sophie didn't move.\nHer eyes sparkled as she looked at the orbs—each one pulsing gently, as if they were alive.\nA soft warmth touched her heart.\nShe approached the girl before wrapping her arms around the bundle of lights,\n\"Thank you for taking care of my son.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website.

      "content": "\"Something is coming!\" William exclaimed, his voice sharp and alert.\nA sudden glimmer burst from his palm as his Shard appeared, shining brightly and ready to attack. His body shifted slightly, placing himself between the grand doors and the others inside the throne room.\nThe heavy silence that had settled moments ago shattered—just like that.\nA tremor shook the ground beneath them.\nThe others tensed.\nThea's fingers curled tightly around the hilt of her dagger. She didn't need to say anything. The overwhelming pressure that flooded in through the cracks of the throne room's door told them all they needed to know.\nSomething wild… something unrestrained was charging straight for them.\nMultiple presences. Strong. Unfamiliar.\nTheir intent was hostile.\n\"What in the world…\" Thea whispered, her throat suddenly dry. It wasn't fear. It was instinct—pure, primal instinct—warning her of a storm.\n\"Probably the Gene—\"\n*Dhak!*\nCharlotte didn't get to finish her words.\nA loud crash tore through the throne room as the thick, stone walls behind her exploded inwards. Dust and debris scattered into the air like shrapnel. A gust of wind surged through the breach.\nFrom the wreckage, three enormous figures emerged.\nThe Parasite Chief surged in from the right side, dragging tendrils of dark ooze behind him. His many eyes darted in all directions, trembling.\nThe Orc Lord came next, charging in from the left like a stampede of beasts. His muscles rippled with fury, and a massive axe was clenched in his fists.\nBetween them stood the Elven King, regal yet ragged. His once-golden robes were stained with black blood, and his bow was already drawn.\nBut none of them looked at the humans standing between them.\nTheir panicked eyes were fixed ahead—towards the shattered inner chamber.\nBeyond that path… were Austin and Astaroth, caged inside a huge dome of darkness.\n\"Our Lord is in there,\" the Parasite Chief muttered, almost in disbelief. There was desperation in his voice, as if everything else in the world had lost meaning.\nHe tried to step forward.\nOnly one.\nBut it was already too far.\nWilliam stepped in front of them, eyes firm and unshaken.\nHe raised his Shard, the blade pulsing with a quiet, steady light—like a heartbeat of defiance.\n\"Only after you defeat me,\" he said, his voice calm, unwavering.\nThe Elf's hand trembled slightly, the sharp edge of fear buried beneath his fury. His voice shook the air like a curse, \"Move aside, humans, or I swear in the name of my creator—I'll grant you a death so horrifying, it'll make you tremble even in the afterlife.\"\nBut William didn't budge.\nHe stood his ground like a wall—solid and unmovable. The others behind him shifted, readying themselves. They all knew the odds. Victory was a distant dream, but none of them stepped back.\nThen suddenly,\n[Notice: The dome is inaccessible to any mortal. The Host's companions don't need to risk their lives to protect it.]\nA mechanical, emotionless voice echoed in the air.\nWilliam blinked, caught off guard for a moment. \"Oh really? Well, then... go ahead,\" he said, easing back his sword. He took a step aside, hand still near his weapon just in case.\nThe Parasite Chief growled deeply, like a beast denied a kill.\nWith a sharp motion, he extended both arms forward. From within his sleeves, thousands of black insects burst out, flooding the ground like a wave. Their legs clicked, their wings buzzed, and together they rushed toward the glowing dome that floated at the center of the chamber.\nThe swarm was enough to strip flesh from bone, enough to bring down stone walls in seconds.\nBut the moment the first wave of insects touched the dome… they didn't devour it.\nInstead, the dome devoured them.\nA low hum filled the air as the insects vanished into the light, one after another—swallowed without resistance. No cracks formed. No scratches appeared. Not even a ripple disturbed its smooth surface.\nThe Orc Lord scoffed, his tusks flaring with rage. Without another word, he charged toward the dome, muscles bulging and axe raised high above his head.\n\"Ghaaaaa!\"\nWith a deafening roar, he brought the weapon down in a brutal arc, aiming to shatter the glowing orb in a single blow.\nThe sound of the impact rang across the hall like a war drum—deep, heavy, and echoing. The ground beneath their feet shook violently. Dust fell from the cracked ceiling, and the massive chandelier hanging above swayed dangerously, its crystals chiming with each tremor.\nBut the dome didn't shatter.\nInstead, it responded.\nIn an instant, a pulse of energy surged outward—twice as powerful as the force delivered.\nBOOOOOOM!\nA massive shockwave erupted.\nThe Orc Lord, caught completely off guard, was flung backward like a ragdoll. His massive body tore through the air before crashing into the stone wall with a thunderous crack. The wall split apart from the impact, sending chunks of debris flying.\nWilliam barely managed to leap to the side, rolling across the floor as the beast shot past him like a cannonball.\nThe creature's body crashed through the thick palace walls, tearing them apart, before landing outside with a sickening thud that echoed across the courtyard.\nA heavy silence followed, broken only by the faint crackling of debris settling around them.\nOlivia grimaced, folding her arms tightly. \"That must've hurt,\" she muttered, glancing at the gaping hole where the Orc Lord had vanished.\nCharlotte, however, wasn't focused on the wreckage. Her eyes remained fixed on the untouched dome. What kind of barrier is this? she wondered. Even a Demon General's full-force strike didn't leave a mark...\nZephyr took a step forward, his face hard with resolve.\nUnlike the others, he didn't speak. His expression alone carried the weight of his thoughts—cold, composed, yet heavy with responsibility.\nHis fingers curled around his Shard, a sleek, brown crossbow etched with ancient runes. The weapon responded to his touch, humming softly as a faint glow lit up its limbs.\nThen the air began to shift.\nA sudden stillness spread through the hall, like the breath of nature itself had paused to watch. The light dimmed. Shadows grew longer. Dust lifted from the ground and hovered in place.\nZephyr slowly raised the crossbow, aiming it at the dome.\nThe energy gathered around him grew intense—so thick it could be felt crawling over their skin.\nThe floor beneath his feet cracked with a loud snap. Dust rained from the ceiling as small tremors echoed through the marble. Outside, thunder rumbled, as if the sky itself was answering his call.\nFrom the heart of the crossbow, an arrow began to form.\nForged from pure ether, shaped like a bolt of compressed light, it pulsed with volatile force. It was no ordinary attack—this was his strongest arrow, the kind only used when no other option remained.\nThe others could only watch, awestruck.\nFor the first time, they felt the weight of Zephyr's title.\nThe strongest General.\nIn that quiet, trembling moment, he whispered—not to them, but to himself.\n\"If this doesn't work…\" His voice was low but steady. \"Then I would be a failure… as your servant.\"\nAnd with that, he pulled the trigger.\nThe string released with a thunderous snap.\nA blinding streak of energy burst from the crossbow, tearing through the air like a falling star. The arrow didn't simply fly—it screamed forward, leaving behind a trail of distorted wind and crackling ether.\nThe force behind it cracked the floor in a straight line, flinging loose stones to the sides as it rushed toward the dome.\nEveryone held their breath.\nThe sound of the impact never came.\nBecause the instant the arrow touched the surface of the dome—it vanished.\nNo explosion.\nNo ripple.\nNo reaction.\nAs if the arrow had been swallowed by the air itself.\nFor a moment, Zephyr just stood there, arm still extended, crossbow still aimed.\n\"…What?\"\nThe word escaped his lips barely above a whisper.\n….\n[Meanwhile inside the dome]\n\"Did you see that? The struggle of your soldiers?\" Austin asked.\nFrom others' perspective, no one was there to listen. But on the ground was a dark puddle.\nThe Demon Lord growled, \"What do you aim to do with this?\"\nAustin chuckled, leaning back in his seat, \"You still don't understand?\" He asked, looking amused.\nThe Demon Lord was slowly regenerating, his legs slowly reforming as he stood back on.\nAustin tilted his head, looking completely unbothered by the seven foot tall Demon before him as he said, \"I am going to torture you until you break the pact yourself and then I bestow death upon you.\"\nAstaroth scoffed, \"You believe you can?\" He charged at Austin, only for the blond one to raise a finger and soon several tentacles wrapped around the Demon.\nAustin smilingly told him, \"I can spend eternity with you here, and not even a day would go by outside. The sole purpose of my life is to get rid of you and I won't step out of this place until I fulfill that.\"\n\"So, let's continue the fun, okay~\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Three chapters max, before we see 'The End'.",

      "content": "\"This situation looks grim.\"\nA flat, endless plain stretched in all directions. No hills, no skies, no shadows—just blinding white.\nA world without borders. A space without time.\nMost minds would break under such emptiness. Ten minutes here could tear through one's sanity. But the beings sitting around the large table weren't ordinary.\nSeven of them. The Seven Gods.\nThey sat in silence for a while, each one weighed down by the same thought.\nAstaroth.\nHe had once shaken the balance of realms. Not because he had the blood of the divine. Not because he was chosen. But because he understood something that few others did—power came from belief.\nThe more he was worshipped, the more his strength multiplied.\nDemons across continents chanted his name. Sacrifices were made. Cities were burned in his honor. And with every act of devotion, Astaroth's reach grew. His flame rose higher, inching toward the heavens.\nAnd had they not acted, he would've reached it.\nBut the heavens weren't built for him.\nHe wasn't a deity. He wasn't bound by the same sense of order. He would've corrupted everything—twisted the very rules they'd built over eons. His rise would've brought ruin not only to mortals, but to the heavens themselves.\nSo they intervened.\nNot with force—but with temptation.\nA deal.\nA promise that no danger would ever touch him, as long as he remained bound to the planet. In return, he would give up his climb. He would never become divine. He would stay mortal.\nThe offer was too good for him to refuse.\nHe accepted.\nAnd from that moment, Astaroth ruled without fear. He became the Monarch—untouchable, unchallenged. A name that echoed across species, nations, and generations.\nUntil it all began to crumble.\nAn anomaly appeared.\nA being outside their plans.\nHe wasn't born of prophecy. He wasn't chosen by them. He came from the cracks in fate—bent the flow of time just to find a challenge. Found allies in places even the Gods had long forgotten. Changed battles that were supposed to be one-sided.\nAnd now, he was fighting Astaroth inside that Dome. Not just fighting—tearing him apart, piece by piece.\n\"He's breaking Astaroth's soul,\" muttered a God with red wings and a short blade at his waist. \"His guards fell. One after another.\"\n\"We warned him,\" another said with a cold tone. \"Our pact was to keep him alive. Not to protect him.\"\nThey had already bent the rules once—secretly restoring Astaroth's vitality to give him a fighting chance. A small push. A hidden favor.\nBut even that was dangerous.\nThe Pact was binding.\nThey weren't allowed to intervene further. Not unless they wished to face judgment themselves.\n\"He thought no one could touch him,\" a third God said, voice heavy with regret. \"Now someone has. And it's too late to stop what's coming.\"\n\"He was never supposed to win,\" said another quietly. \"Just to rule. Just to hold the balance until the end. That was the whole point.\"\n\"But now the end may come early,\" said the one with the sword. \"And not on our terms.\"\nThe table grew quiet again.\n\"I don't understand,\" said the youngest among them, his tone sharp and careless. \"Why are we even worried? It's not like we care about that demon. All we need to do is show up when he's on the brink of death and erase that brat.\"\nA few of the older Gods sighed in unison. The silence that followed was heavy—until the one sitting beside him turned his head.\n\"That's not the point, brother,\" the older one replied calmly. \"The anomaly is getting stronger by the second. His power was already enough to suppress Astaroth's soul inside that dome. And now… now he's approaching something else.\"\nHe paused.\n\"An evolution.\"\nThe younger God clicked his tongue in annoyance. \"So what, we're worried he might reach our level?\"\n\"No,\" the older one said, turning his gaze forward. \"We're worried he might go beyond it.\"\nThe room fell quiet again.\nThe idea wasn't impossible. No one wanted to admit it, but they had all felt it—that subtle shift in the threads of fate. The anomaly wasn't just some overpowered mortal playing with magic. He was rewriting rules. Bending natural laws. Challenging the divine not out of hate, not for glory… but because he could.\nAnd the most annoying part: he doesn't need followers, devotees to reach this height.\n\"We need to do something about this soon or it will be too late.\"\nAstaroth was an evil entity who could have risked the world order. But Austin? They knew he would take his revenge on them once he reached the heavens.\n....\n\"Valerie,\" Cedric called out as he approached the girl.\nShe turned toward him, her brows elevating. \"Father… do you need something?\"\nSelner also looked over, sensing the hesitation in Cedric's steps.\nThe man looked hesitant as he spoke, \"Um… I know this might not be the best time to ask, and we should probably be more patient given the situation… but do you happen to have anything to drink?\"\nValerie's heart sank slightly. Guilt surfaced on her face.\nShe hadn't brought anything with her.\nThere hadn't been time to prepare, and just moments ago, she and Selner had been discussing how they were going to survive in this dungeon. They had no idea how long they would be trapped here, and supplies were already becoming a concern.\nShe opened her mouth to respond—but before she could say a word, the familiar chime of the system echoed in their ears.\n[All necessary supplies will be delivered based on immediate needs. Please state your requirement.]\nCedric blinked, clearly startled. \"…Can I get some water?\"\nWithout another sound, a large clay jar appeared on the ground, along with several clean glasses.\n[The host had stored supplies in the inventory for this situation. However, please remain mindful of your resource consumption.]\nCedric stared for a second before picking up the jar. The surface was cool to the touch, condensation forming along the sides.\nHe turned toward the air and gave a small, grateful nod. \"Thanks, dear.\"\nValerie let out a long breath of relief. \"Austin planned for everything… thankfully.\"\nSelner gave a small nod. \"I couldn't use my Teleportation here either. If not for him, things could've turned ugly fast.\"\nValerie wrapped her arms around herself, her eyes distant. \"How long do you think it'll take before he returns?\"\nOnly two hours had passed since Austin left—but every minute without him felt heavier than the last. Her chest remained tight, her thoughts restless.\nThe very idea that her Lord was out there—alone, and with the Demon Lord—gnawed at her heart.\nSelner sighed softly. \"The fact that we're still here, and the System hasn't raised any alarms… it tells me Austin's alright.\"\nShe looked toward the pale glow of the System's interface.\nShe'd noticed it before—the subtle warmth in its tone whenever Austin was mentioned, the way it responded a little faster to his voice, how it always addressed him with quiet reverence.\nThe System may have been artificial… but Selner knew better. It was emotionally connected to Austin, in ways that couldn't be defined with logic.\nAnd the fact that it remained calm, still managing supplies and offering support, was its own kind of reassurance.\nAustin was alive.\nAnd for now… that was enough.\n....\nAustin let out a quiet sigh.\nIt had been a month—inside this sealed space—since he captured the being before him.\nHe always knew this path would be slow, that it would demand patience and control. Still… he couldn't help but miss Valerie.\nHer warmth, her steady presence, her smiling face—he missed all of it.\nFortunately, the brutal training he underwent inside the dungeon after the Parasite Chief's attack had tempered his emotions. It had taught him how to endure.\nBut that didn't make the waiting any easier.\nAnd even now, he had no idea how long it would take to fully break the Demon Lord's will.\nOutside… maybe a day has passed, he guessed silently. Two, at most.\nThe voice that broke the silence was deep, persuasive, and soaked in an ancient pride.\n\"Why don't you make this a fair fight, Warrior?\" the Demon Lord offered, his tone almost inviting. \"Like in the old days. Let's end this the way we previously did. Steel against steel. Magic against magic. No chains. No seals.\"\nAustin didn't even blink.\nInstead, he muttered, almost lazily, \"So… your woman taught you the art of bullshit, huh?\"\nThere was a faint chuckle from the shadows ahead.\nAmused. Unbothered.\nAnd then, a shadow materialized before Austin, glaring at him with all the hatred he could muster, before voicing, \"You won't win this, Warrior. Even if I have to spend the rest of eternity here with you, I promise on my pride, my soul, I won't give up.\"\nAustin shrugged, \"Well, let's see about that.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading. If you have enjoyed the story so far, consider dropping a review.",

      "content": "It had been ten days.\nTen days since he left her side.\nTen days since he walked into a battle with the greatest threat to humanity.\nValerie couldn't sit still anymore.\nShe looked at the others. They were fast asleep in their sleeping bags.\nAs promised, the system was taking care of everyone's basic needs within the resting zone.\nA separate zone for the washroom. Three meals a day, some arrangements for beverages.\nBut even with food and shelter, none of them were truly at ease.\nThey were worried—anxious about what was going on outside.\nNo one asked too many questions, neither to her nor the system.\nBut Valerie could still sense it in their eyes. The quiet unease. The tension.\nAnd more than anyone else, Valerie was the most restless.\nShe wanted to know where he was.\nShe missed him.\nEven a single word from him would be enough—just something to let her know he was okay.\nBut each time she asked the system about him, it gave the same reply:\n[The host is currently in the most secure shelter and is tormenting the Demon Lord to attain victory.]\nShe already knew of his plan—he had told her that he was going to break Astaroth down until he gave in and shattered the pact.\nBut even back then, Selner had warned her. It was a dangerous move.\nAstaroth wasn't just any demon. He had been around for thousands of years.\nHe lived for one purpose—to rule this world.\nBreaking his will and making him surrender wasn't just hard.\nIt was nearly impossible.\n\"Are you okay?\" came a familiar voice from behind.\nValerie turned and saw the pink-haired girl standing there.\nWith a soft nod, she said, \"Yeah... just lost in thought.\"\n\"I don't even have to guess who it's about. It's Austin, isn't it?\" Rhea asked, walking up beside her.\nValerie sighed. \"It's not just me. Everyone's hoping he'll come back after defeating that monster.\"\nRhea looked down for a moment.\n\"Until a few days ago, I couldn't even imagine Austin being the one to fight the Demon Lord.\nAnd now… he's doing it all by himself.\"\nThen, glancing up at Valerie, she asked quietly, \"Was he always that strong? Was he hiding his strength?\"\nValerie froze for a moment. She couldn't tell Rhea the truth—that Austin had gone back in time just like her.\nSo she gave the most believable explanation she could think of.\n\"His soul was split into fragments. When he turned seventeen, he finally recovered the missing part.\"\nRhea let out a dry laugh. \"If you don't want to tell me, just say that.\"\nValerie gave a small smile. \"You're right. I can't tell you.\"\nBut one part of what she said was still true.\nAustin's soul really had been torn into pieces once.\n\"Well… what do you plan on doing if Austin really defeats the Demon Lord?\" Valerie asked, gently shifting the topic.\nRhea blinked, caught off guard by the question.\n\"I—I haven't thought about that at all,\" she admitted, her voice low. Then, after a moment, she sighed.\n\"My reason for joining the Academy was simple—to kill as many demons as I could. To get revenge for what they did to my parents. That was it. That was all I lived for. But now... if Austin actually ends all of this… I don't know what I'll be left with.\"\nRhea's life goal was simple. She lived just to end the misery of the people. To eradicate the being who has only given grief and tears to innocent people.\nHowever, if Austin deals with that being…Rhea doesn't know what she would live for? Maybe open a shop or something?\nThere was a quiet pause. Only the faint rustle of wind outside the resting zone could be heard.\nValerie's eyes softened as she looked at the girl in front of her.\nRhea wasn't someone who opened up easily, and hearing her talk like this—it reminded Valerie of something.\nA small, forgotten memory floated to the surface.\nA promise.\nOne she made a long time ago.\nTo this very girl.\nShe gave a thoughtful shrug, trying to keep her tone casual.\n\"Well, why don't you come and work as a Knight for the Corwon family?\"\nRhea's eyes widened in shock. \"Wait, seriously? You mean it?\"\nHer voice was filled with disbelief, almost like she thought Valerie was joking.\nValerie gave a small smile and nodded.\n\"I've seen what you're capable of. Your combat skills, your instincts—they're real. You didn't go through all that training and all those battles just to throw everything away. If you want to keep using your strength, then why not pursue a life where your skills matter? One where all your pain and effort won't be for nothing?\"\nRhea stood there in silence, unable to speak.\nThis… was unexpected.\nJust a few weeks ago, the two of them had clashed so hard that Valerie nearly killed her in a moment of rage.\nThey had been on bad terms for months—ever since that orientation. Ever since Austin's focus gathered at Rhea. Ever since the man, Valerie loves, started liking Rhea.\nWhether it was pride, misunderstanding, or past wounds, the fact remained the same: Valerie couldn't stand the sight of Rhea for the longest time.\nThey had barely exchanged words without tension.\nThey weren't friends. Not even close.\nAnd now, all of a sudden, Valerie was offering her a future? A place at her side?\nRhea didn't know what to feel.\nHer heart was heavy, confused—yet strangely warm.\n\"…Why?\" she finally whispered, eyes lowered. \"After everything between us… why would you offer me this?\"\nValerie looked at her, then turned her gaze toward the sky.\nWith a sigh, she finally responded, \"Because…it no longer matters.\"\n°°°°°°°\nA year had passed.\nAnd Austin was still in confinement—trapped in the same space as Astaroth.\nHe leaned back against the cold, black throne carved into the stone behind him, his eyes fixed on the ring wrapped around his finger.\nThat simple ring… he had stared at it for months now, as if it held all the answers he needed.\nOther than that, there wasn't much to do here.\nNo light.\nNo sound.\nOnly silence, and the company of a half-dead Demon Lord.\nFor the past year, that was all he had—his thoughts, the endless dark, and whatever twisted conversations Astaroth decided to engage in.\nHe couldn't access his inventory, but it didn't matter anymore.\nHe didn't need food. He didn't need rest.\nHe didn't even need air.\nHis magic had become his life source—steady, unshaken, and constantly growing.\nWith each passing moment, it refined itself, becoming colder, denser… and more detached.\nFrom the moment he had leapt off that cliff and embraced the darkness, he knew this day would come.\nHe had chosen it.\nHe had accepted it.\nHe had sacrificed everything for it.\nIn front of him, Astaroth lay broken.\nThe upper half of the Demon Lord's body had been tossed somewhere far across this empty void, while the lower half remained here—still, lifeless, and rotting.\nEven a being who had walked the earth for thousands of years had limits.\nAnd Austin was patient enough to reach them.\nYet even now, his mind was calculating.\nThinking of the next way he could drag the demon's suffering further.\nWhat hadn't he tried yet?\nWhat other method could crush his spirit just a little more?\nThat's when a voice echoed out of nowhere.\nAncient, eerie, and emotionless.\n[You are losing your emotions, Human.]\nAustin blinked.\nFor a moment, he wasn't sure if it was the Demon Lord trying to get into his head again—or something else.\nBut then, he realized what this was,\n\"So you decided to show up, eh?\" He smirked and sat up on the throne.\nBefore him appeared several golden orbs.\nAustin knew what it was.\n\"The immortal one…have you finally decided to break the pact?\" He asked.\nThe other one soon responded,\n[I am here to warn you. You are losing your emotions. All the connections you hold towards your loved ones…you will forget all about them. You will be nothing but an empty shell.]\nAustin shrugged, \"You think I don't know that?\" He was warned by his old self about it as well.\nHe doesn't know the source of his powers. Previously, he was just drawing power from that source. But this time, he had embraced it. Became one with it.\nHe was losing his feelings slowly. He knew that.\nBut, \"Until I have this…\" he said, raising his finger up high, a smile etched on his face, \"...until I have my Val, I know I will remain human.\"\nLeaning back, he said, \"So…no need to worry about me. Yes, if you want to switch sides then surely, you can contact me.\"\nHe hadn't come this far to give up. He was going to get rid of every single being who can become an obstacle to him.\nNothing can stop him from creating a peaceful world for his Val.\n[You will regret this.]\nAnd the voice faded.\nAustin chuckled, \"Well, let's continue, Astaroth. No one is coming to save your ass.\"\n°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

Free.\nHe felt as if he could go anywhere.\nDo anything.\nBe anyone.\nAnd yet… something was missing.\nDesire.\nHe could have everything—yet wanted nothing.\nWhere could he go? Every place felt empty.\nWhat could he become? Nothing stirred his soul.\nEverything seemed within reach, yet every goal felt pointless.\nWhat was the meaning of this life?\nRuling held no thrill. Serving was even worse.\nTo be alone, or to have someone… neither called to him.\n\"Are you sure about it?\"\nWhat could he even do now?\nHe could become the strongest being to ever exist.\nHe could rule over gods and demons alike.\nHe could become more terrifying than the Demon Lord himself.\n\"But is that truly what you want, my Lord?\"\nHe didn't know anymore.\nMaybe his life had no meaning.\nOr maybe…\n\"It does, my husband. Your life has meaning. You belong somewhere. You belong to me.\"\n\"Mmm…?\" Austin stirred, a faint sound escaping his lips as he opened his eyes slowly.\nFor a moment, time stood still.\nHe saw her.\nHer back faced him, hands gently clasped behind her.\nLong violet hair flowed down like a curtain, swaying as if caught in a breeze.\nAustin tilted his head and whispered, \"…Val?\"\nShe turned slightly, looking at him over her shoulder. \"Did you miss me?\" she asked with a soft smile.\nAnd just like that—his heart, silent for so long, started to beat again.\nFaster.\nStronger.\n\"…Val?\" he said again, his voice trembling, afraid she might vanish if he blinked.\n\"I'm here, Austin,\" she said, finally turning to face him.\nHer eyes were warm.\nHer smile—the same one that once healed every wound in his heart.\nShe was just as beautiful as the day he last saw her.\nExactly as he remembered.\n\"Val…\" His lips curled into a fragile smile. Frost still clung to his face, but his hand reached out to her. \"I don't want to be here… I need you. It's cold here… and I'm so lonely.\"\nShe stepped closer, her voice a gentle whisper, \"I know… I miss you too. Every second without you feels like a lifetime. Every night, when I hear the faintest sound, I look up, hoping it's you.\"\nA lump rose in Austin's throat.\nHis voice cracked, \"I want to see you, Val… This is harder than I thought. I—I feel like I'm slipping. Like I'm losing who I am.\"\nHe had ignored Selner's warning.\nAnd now, he was paying the price.\nIt had been years since he entered the void.\nYears since he last held her.\nSince he last felt her warmth.\nSince he last buried his face in her hair and breathed in that calming scent of hers.\nHe missed everything.\nHe craved her more than anything.\nFor so long, he had clung to their wedding ring, staring at it for hours just to keep himself sane.\nTo survive the darkness.\nTo finish the war with his mind intact.\nBut now… he was reaching his breaking point.\n\"Dear,\" Valerie's voice gently reached his ears.\nAustin slowly lifted his head, and what he saw shattered him.\nTears glimmered in her eyes.\n\"You are my strength, Austin,\" she whispered. \"Every day, I stand tall and encourage those around me… because I know that somewhere out there, my husband is still fighting for us.\"\nHer voice trembled, but her gaze held firm.\n\"So please… for the sake of my belief in you—get up. For me… you have to end this. You promised you'd give me a better world. I want you to keep that promise.\"\nAustin's breath caught in his throat.\nPromise.\nYes… he had made a promise.\nHe remembered the day he held her hand.\nThe day he slid the ring onto her finger.\nThe day they took their vows, sealing them with a kiss.\nThat day, he looked her in the eyes and promised her a future.\nA better world.\nHe had forgotten, lost in the endless void.\nBut now—now he remembered.\nHe still had something burning inside his heart.\nA reason to keep going.\nA desire that hadn't faded:\nTo build a peaceful world for Valerie.\n\"I'm sorry, Val…\" Austin whispered, voice shaking. \"I lost myself for a while… but no more.\"\nClarity returned to his eyes.\nDetermination surged back into his soul.\n\"I'm coming back to you, Val,\" he said, his voice stronger now.\nThe void around him trembled.\nThe empty space began to shift and twist.\nHis body started to glow—light pouring from within him.\nAnd slowly, the dark space bent and reshaped itself… as if obeying his will.\nAt last, he broke free from his cocoon.\nThe glowing orbs that had surrounded him scattered like stardust, fading into the darkness.\nAustin landed on his feet with a light thud, then stretched his arms as if shaking off the lingering weight of the void.\n\"Had fun trying to corrupt me?\" he said, voice calm but laced with quiet defiance, as he looked at the immortal beings around him.\nHe had figured it out long ago.\nIt was them.\nThey were the ones who had pulled him into that state—who had shown him the seductive taste of what it meant to be eternal. To be absolute.\nThey had tempted him with power… with the promise of endless control.\nAnd for a moment, he had almost surrendered to it.\nHe had almost let go.\nBut she brought him back.\nValerie.\nHis wife had saved him—again.\nHer voice, her warmth, her belief in him had pulled him back from the brink.\n[You are a fool if you think you can escape your destiny,]\na voice echoed in his mind, dark and ancient.\n[Sooner or later, that fragile thread that binds you to your lover will snap—and when it does, you'll be lost all over again.]\nAustin let out a soft chuckle.\nWithout hesitation, he bent down and picked up the fallen horn of Astaroth from the ground.\nHe stared at it for a moment, then drove it into his own stomach.\nBut instead of piercing flesh, the horn began to dissolve—absorbed into his body like a forgotten part returning home.\nA silent storm brewed in his eyes.\nPower surged through his veins as Astaroth's soul began to merge with his own.\nDarkness met void—chaos met dead calmness.\n\"You think so?\" Austin said, stepping forward with measured calm. \"Then let's test it.\"\nWithout hesitation, he reached down and grabbed one of Astaroth's severed arms.\n\"I'll absorb him,\" he declared coldly. \"And every last demon that walks this planet. Maybe a few humans too, if that's what it takes.\"\nHis fingers clenched tighter, and a twisted, menacing grin spread across his lips.\n\"I want to know,\" he said slowly, \"if your theory applies to me.

      "content": "Chapter 320: Chapter 319- I am back\nSelner was worried—just like everyone else around her.\nOnly a few minutes ago, the system had sent out a message. It warned them that Austin was in trouble.\nThey had been trapped inside this dungeon for five months now. In all that time, the system had never spoken like this before. That alone was enough to shake everyone to their core.\nMany began to fear the worst.\nSome whispered that Austin might have finally fallen... that maybe, in the end, the Demon Lord had won.\nBut Selner didn’t believe that. No, she couldn’t.\nShe knew Austin better than anyone. Losing wasn’t something he did easily. At least, not in this kind of fight.\nIt wasn’t a battle where he’d fall and die.\nIt was simple—he would either win or... surrender.\nBut surrendering?\nThat wasn’t going to happen.\nNot to Astaroth.\nSelner had met that being before. Astaroth was strong, yes, but not enough to force Austin to his knees. Not enough to make him give up.\nSoon after, the system had sent out another message—this time, it requested Valerie’s help. It said her presence was necessary... or they might lose Austin forever.\nValerie didn’t even hesitate. She agreed right away.\nNow, she stood completely still, as if frozen in place. Her eyes were shut, and she hadn’t moved a muscle in several minutes.\nSelner didn’t need to check on her to know what was happening.\nHer body was here. But her mind—her soul—was somewhere else.\nShe was with Austin.\n\"I don’t get it,\" Rudolph muttered, brows furrowed. \"If his life isn’t in danger, then what’s so urgent?\"\nThe system had clearly said that Austin wasn’t dying... but the situation was critical.\n\"Maybe he’s pushing himself too far?\" Sebastian suggested, his voice carrying worry. \"Overdoing it?\"\nSelner could feel the tension in the group growing thicker.\nEveryone was anxious. Nervous.\nAnd to be honest... she was too.\nBut unlike the others, Selner had been through situations like this before. Her experience helped her stay calm, even now.\nShe drew in a deep breath, then spoke with quiet strength.\n\"The being Austin is facing... it has the potential to become immortal.\"\nHer words caught everyone’s attention. All eyes turned to her—the violet-haired woman who rarely spoke unless it mattered.\nShe continued, her voice steady but firm.\n\"I don’t know how many of you are aware of Austin’s Shard. But let me explain.\"\nSelner looked around before going on.\n\"Austin’s Shard gives him a very rare ability. He can absorb the soul of any powerful being he defeats. Not just kill them—he assimilates them. That’s the nature of his Shard.\"\nShe paused, letting the words sink in.\n\"So no... I don’t think he’s in physical danger. But something deeper is happening. And whatever it is... Valerie is now part of it too.\"\nMany among them showed deep concern.\nAfter all, the idea of Austin trying to absorb someone who was already on the verge of becoming an immortal... it sounded incredibly risky.\nEven the bravest in the room couldn’t hide their unease.\n\"Is he safe?\" Sophie finally asked, her voice soft and trembling with worry.\nSelner folded her arms tightly across her chest, then slowly shook her head.\n\"I can’t say for certain what exactly is happening,\" she admitted, her tone firm yet troubled. \"But if my guess is right... Austin is losing himself. His humanity. His emotions. Piece by piece, he’s fading. And that, I believe, is why the system called for Valerie.\"\nHer words brought a heavy silence over the group.\nIt wasn’t life-threatening, not in the way they’d feared.\nBut it wasn’t good either.\nBecause while Austin’s body may not be in danger... his mind—his soul—was still slipping.\nHe was still losing.\nAnd this kind of loss was harder to heal from.\n\"She’s right about that,\" Valerie suddenly said, her voice steady but soft, drawing everyone’s attention in an instant.\nAll eyes turned toward her.\nSophie quickly stepped forward, hope and anxiety battling in her voice. \"Did you meet him?\"\nValerie gave a faint nod. Her face was pale, lips pressed into a thin line.\n\"I saw him...\" she whispered. \"He... h-he didn’t look good.\"\nThe Queen’s heart sank at those words. Her expression faltered, and a wave of unease spread through the group. One by one, others stepped forward, desperate to know more.\nThe first to speak was Rudolph’s father, unable to contain himself. \"What happened? Did he speak to you?\"\nValerie nodded again, this time more slowly.\n\"He did. But... it took him a long time to respond. It felt like... like he was struggling just to stay aware. To remain himself.\"\nShe paused, her voice growing faint. \"He seemed lost... like he was fighting a storm inside his own head.\"\nHer words landed like a heavy stone.\nA deep, uncomfortable silence filled the space.\nThey had waited for months—holding on to hope, imagining Austin growing stronger, surviving, enduring. Always expecting that when news came, it would be a sign of progress.\nBut now, the first real news they heard...\nWas that he was barely holding on.\nSophie’s eyes turned watery.\nWhile they had each other, her son was there all alone, fighting a war on his own.\nNot just against his opponent but to himself as well.\nGrave silence ensued.\nSelner stepped closer, \"...Valerie...was he losing himself?\"\nEveryone held their breath. Waiting for her response. If that’s the case, then...they might not ever see Austin again.\nMany things might change.\nValerie was about to say something, when suddenly the space around them turned black.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What the-\"\nAnd in the next instance, they all were standing inside the academy, in the front campus.\n\"Why are we here?\"\n\"Damn...it feels so long...\"\n\"What just happened?\"\nWhile everyone was wondering what suddenly happened, Valerie’s eyes moved through the crowd.\nThere, standing near the same fountain where she always used to wait for him, was a certain familiar blond boy.\nShe slowly stepped forward.\nHer eyes moist and lips parted.\nShe couldn’t believe her eyes but she wanted to reach him.\nEven if her mind was playing games.\nEven if this wasn’t reality.\nShe...wanted to go near him.\nTry to touch him.\nEveryone else followed her line of sight.\nAnd many of them gasped.\nSince this was no illusion.\n\"I am back.\"\n°°°°°°°°°\nA/N:- Thanks for reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 321: Chapter 320- The end\nWhat exactly happened?\nHow was Austin freed from the torment he had built around himself? How did he cast off Astaroth’s curse and reclaim his life?\nWere those winged beings truly so benevolent as to let him go?\nNo, not quite.\nThey weren’t kind. Not even close.\nThey watched him suffer in silence—watched as the void gnawed at his sanity. And all the while, they whispered to him. Again and again, they reminded him of what he had lost... and what he would lose forever if he chose to absorb Astaroth.\nThey warned him that immortality came at a cost: the death of emotion. The abandonment of human ties. If he truly meant to destroy Astaroth, then he would have to become something more than mortal—something colder.\nSomething that could no longer love.\nAnd that terrified him more than anything.\nBecause the only thing that kept him alive in that endless darkness... was the thought of her.\nValerie.\nHis reason. His anchor. His light.\nHe endured the pain, bore the emptiness, all because he believed—no, hoped—that he would see her again.\nBut if he had taken that final step... if he had accepted the power and crossed the line into godhood... then he would have lost her. Forever.\nAnd he didn’t know if he could’ve survived that.\nThankfully, it never came to that.\nIn the end, the gods offered him a choice.\nA new deal—one that severed the old contract with Astaroth and replaced it with one forged directly with Austin.\nIt mirrored the previous terms: he would never gain immortality. And in return, they would grant him the freedom to live as he chose.\nA simple life. A mortal life.\nToo good to be true?\nIt should’ve been. And it would have been... if not for the clause they added.\nA promise.\nAccording to the new contract, when a war breaks out—sometime in the coming years—Austin must stand on their side.\nNo further details. No explanation of the enemy or the cause. Just a promise that, when the time came, he would fight for them.\nAnd so he agreed.\nBecause even if that war brought chaos or death, it was better than staying trapped in that timeless void. Better than losing Valerie.\nAnd now... he was here.\nAlive.\nHolding her in his arms, breathing her in, grounding himself in the warmth of her embrace.\nStanding before every person who had ever mattered to him.\nHe was finally home.\n\"So... the war is finally over?\" Rhea asked, her voice trembling with disbelief.\nThe great war—fought fiercely for over a thousand years—had truly come to an end? The words felt too surreal to trust. Too good to be true.\nBut even as it sounded ridiculous in her ears, Austin gave a firm nod.\n\"With the Demon Lord and his minions gone, yes... the war is over.\"\nThe threat that had loomed over their heads for centuries—humanity’s greatest nightmare—was finally gone.\n\"We’re free...\" Robert muttered, running a hand through his hair, as if trying to ground himself in this impossible truth.\n\"The war... is over,\" Cedric whispered to himself, eyes distant. He couldn’t believe that his son—his own son—had done something that would be written in history with golden ink.\n\"No more wars,\" said Rudolph’s father, the words leaving his lips in quiet awe.\n\"No more training,\" Rudolph echoed, though it was hard to tell whether he was celebrating or mourning the end of a life he had only ever known.\n\"Austin...\" Sophie’s voice trembled as she stepped forward, tears pooling in her eyes.\nAustin turned to her, opening his other arm wide. \"I’m home, Ma.\"\nWith a soft sob, Sophie rushed into her son’s embrace.\nAfter what felt like ages, she was finally holding him—not in worry, not in fear, but in pure, overwhelming relief. Her son was back, safe and alive.\nAustin’s gaze lifted to Selner. He met her eyes, and saw the redness there too, though she quickly wiped them and offered him a quiet smile.\nStill holding his mother and Valerie close, he reached out his hand.\nSelner stepped forward, hesitated only for a moment, then took it gently.\n\"Welcome back,\" she whispered, her voice barely holding steady.\n\"Thank you,\" Austin replied, \"for taking care of them.\"\nSelner didn’t answer with words—just a soft smile that held years of pain, hope, and quiet admiration. She was still overwhelmed by his return... and the silence.\nThere was no trace of Astaroth anywhere.\nShe had watched centuries pass—watched empires fall, children become warriors, and hope flicker like a dying candle. She had seen the world twist and writhe under Astaroth’s shadow.\nShe had seen Austin fall.\nShe had witnessed him send fragments of his soul through time, across generations, desperately reaching for a different outcome.\nAnd now, finally...\nHe had done it.\nHe had changed the fate of the world.\nSelner closed her eyes, letting the warmth of this moment wash over her.\nYou won, Austin.\nYou finally gave this world the change it so desperately needed.\nCedric stepped forward, his voice ringing with pride and emotion. \"This is an occasion to celebrate. We... have finally won!\"\nA moment of stunned silence followed.\nThen came the explosion of joy.\nCheers erupted through the courtyard like a wave breaking through stone. Rudolph and his father let out the loudest cries, their voices booming with raw, unfiltered relief. They threw their arms into the air, embracing anyone within reach.\nThe sound drew more people.\nStudents from across the academy began to trickle into the courtyard, whispering to each other, their eyes searching for answers. Teachers followed, their faces tense with concern, heading straight to the Headmaster.\nThe old man stood at the front steps of the academy, trembling slightly, tears gathered in his eyes. And then, with a smile that had been waiting for years to bloom, he addressed them:\n\"We won.\" His voice cracked. \"Tell everyone... the war is over. We’ve won!\"\nThe words spread like wildfire.\nFirst from the teachers, who turned and repeated it to nearby students. Then from those students who broke into sprints, racing down halls and across dorm courtyards to tell their friends, their mentors, anyone who would listen.\n\"We’ve won!\"\n\"The Demon Lord is gone!\"\n\"It’s over—it’s really over!\"\nWithin minutes, bells rang from the academy towers. Their chimes were not the sound of warning or mourning—but of celebration.\nMore students flooded the grounds, and laughter began to fill the air. Some cried, some laughed, some stood frozen in place as if the weight of centuries had just been lifted from their shoulders. Hugs were exchanged between unlikely people. Rivalries forgotten. A sense of unity bound them together in that moment.\nThey had survived.\nThey had triumphed.\nCedric turned, pulling his wife into his arms. The two held each other tightly, tears rolling freely down their cheeks. Their son—their son—had returned alive. He wasn’t just another name carved into the long list of the fallen. He was here. Breathing. Warm.\nAustin glanced toward the edge of the gathering and found Sebastian standing still, the old butler’s shoulders stiff, his eyes glistening. The man had seen far more than he ever let on—more versions of Austin than anyone should.\nAustin raised his voice just enough for him to hear. \"I did it, Sebas.\"\nSebastian’s lips moved in a quiet reply. \"I’m proud of you.\"\nAustin’s heart warmed. He knew... he knew Sebastian must have seen the darkest versions of him in those timelines. The failures. The ones who gave in. The one who only knew how to whine...how to blame.\nBut not this one.\nThis version stood tall, victorious, and surrounded by those he loved.\nHe looked down at Valerie—the woman who had waited for him through silence and pain.\nHe gently rubbed her back and asked, \"Were you lonely without me?\"\nValerie didn’t speak. She only hummed, soft and low, and nodded against his shoulder.\nIt was an adorable, quiet gesture—but heavy with all the waiting, the prayers, the sleepless nights. The ache she had endured without ever knowing whether he’d return.\nAustin tightened his hold on her.\nThe war was over. But what he had now—this—was the reward he’d fought for.\nAnd in the background, as the sun dipped lower in the sky, the bells continued to ring, echoing across the academy and beyond—announcing to the world:\nThe end of an era had come.\nAnd a new one was just beginning.\n°°°°°°°\nA/N:- What happened to Selner? How did their wedding go? What about the kids? Was Austin a good husband? What about the dates I promised? Well, well, well, if I get time then why not? Thanks for being a part of such a wonderful journey.\nI will never forget the love and support you guys showed for this story.
